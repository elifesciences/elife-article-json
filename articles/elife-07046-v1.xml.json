Non-canonical Frizzled2 (Fz2) signaling generates calcium transients that determine neuronal polarity, neuronal migration and synapse assembly in the developing vertebrate brain. Here, we demonstrate a requirement for Fz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in determining the final differentiated state of a set of central brain dopaminergic neurons in <i>Drosophila</i>, referred to as the PAM cluster. Knockdown or inhibition of Fz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during maturation of the flight circuit in pupae reduces <i>Tyrosine Hydroxylase</i> (<i>TH</i>) expression in the PAM neurons and affects maintenance of flight. Thus we demonstrate that Fz2/Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during development serve as a pre-requisite for normal adult behavior. Our results support a neural mechanism where PAM neuron send projections to the \u03b1' and \u03b2' lobes of a higher brain centre, the mushroom body, and function in dopaminergic re-inforcement of flight."
