In chick embryos, skeletal muscle formation is initiated by migrating Delta1-expressing neural crest cells that trigger NOTCH signaling and myogenesis in selected epithelial somite progenitor cells, which rapidly translocate into the nascent muscle to differentiate. Here, we uncovered at the heart of this response a signaling module encompassing NOTCH, GSK-3\u03b2, SNAI1 and \u03b2-catenin. Independent of its transcriptional function, NOTCH profoundly inhibits GSK-3\u03b2 activity. As a result SNAI1 is stabilized, triggering an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. This allows the recruitment of \u03b2-catenin from the membrane, which acts as a transcriptional co-factor to activate myogenesis, independently of WNT ligand. Our results intimately associate the initiation of myogenesis to a change in cell adhesion and may reveal a general principle for coupling cell fate changes to EMT in many developmental and pathological processes."

Here, we uncovered at the heart of this response a signaling module encompassing NOTCH, GSK-3\u03b2, SNAI1 and \u03b2-catenin. Independent of its transcriptional function, NOTCH profoundly inhibits GSK-3\u03b2 activity. As a result SNAI1 is stabilized, triggering an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. This allows the recruitment of \u03b2-catenin from the membrane, which acts as a transcriptional co-factor to activate myogenesis, independently of WNT ligand. Our results intimately associate the initiation of myogenesis to a change in cell adhesion and may reveal a general principle for coupling cell fate changes to EMT in many developmental and pathological processes."

It was later shown that WNT1 and WNT3a are expressed in the dorsal neural tube and that, in vitro, both ligands enhance myogenesis in somites (<a href=\"#bib31\">Munsterberg et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Stern et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tajbakhsh et al., 1998</a>). A major consequence of the activation of the 'canonical' WNT pathway by WNT ligands is that \u03b2-catenin, normally degraded by the APC/Axin destruction complex, accumulates in the cytoplasm and enters the nucleus, where it engages DNA-bound TCF transcription factor to activate their targets (hence the name of WNT/\u03b2-catenin-dependent pathway to this cellular response). Since it was demonstrated that MYF5 promoter contains TCF binding sites required for its in vivo expression in the DML (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borello et al., 2006</a>) and that dominant negative and constitutively active forms of TCF and \u03b2-catenin modulate MYF5 expression in somites (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abu-Elmagd et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gros et al., 2009</a>), this has led to the largely accepted theory that myogenesis in somites is under the control of WNTs from the dorsal neural tube acting through a WNT/\u03b2-catenin-dependent pathway."

This finding is compatible with the well-documented role of the dorsal neural tube in myogenesis. Importantly, the mosaic expression of Delta1 in the migrating neural crest cell population ensures that NOTCH signaling is regularly triggered in selected DML cells, thus explaining the cell fate choice necessary to generate myotomal cells over an extended period of time, all while self-renewing the progenitor population. However, this finding was not in accordance with the established role of WNT in myogenesis, nor did it explain why the initiation of the myogenic program in selected progenitors within the DML is associated with their translocation into the primary myotome <i>via</i> an EMT."

As a consequence, \u03b2-catenin from the cell membrane pool is mobilized, allowing its entry into the nucleus where it activates MYF5 expression in a WNT ligand-independent manner. Therefore, our results suggest that non-canonical functions of NOTCH and \u03b2-catenin, associated in an efficient signaling circuitry, explain the coupling of myogenesis with changes in cell adhesion in the DML."

As WNT and Delta1 are reported to activate myogenesis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Munsterberg et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rios et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Stern et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tajbakhsh et al., 1998</a>), it was important to determine whether and how these pathways co-operate in this process. As a first step, we co-electroporated the DML of trunk-level somites (as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013D</a>) with reporter constructs for the NOTCH and WNT pathways. The NOTCH reporter (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ohtsuka et al., 2006</a>) contains the HES1 promoter region upstream of a destabilized red fluorescent protein. HES1 is a direct target of the NOTCH pathway, and we previously showed this construct serves as a faithful reporter of NOTCH activity in somites (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rios et al., 2011</a>). The 'TOPflash' reporter (<a href=\"#bib24\">Korinek et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rios et al., 2010</a>) contains twelve TCF-1 binding sites upstream of a destabilized EGFP (12Tf-d2EGFP). The activity of the TOPflash reporter is triggered by the binding of the transcription factor TCF/LEF together with its co-factor \u03b2-catenin. The destabilized fluorescent reporter proteins present in both constructs allow the visualization of only the cells that are actively engaged in NOTCH and WNT signaling, while the intensity of the signal indicates the magnitude of the response."

On the contrary, most cells that expressed low levels of TOPflash fluorescence were NOTCH-reporter negative (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,D</a>). It was important to show that this difference was not due to electroporation, since DNA transfer with this technique is inherently variable between cells. To show that the variable levels of TOPflash activity were not the result of variable amounts of electroporated plasmids, we plotted the intensity of TOPflash response against that of the BFP as a control. BFP is driven by an ubiquitous promoter and its fluorescence should thus be directly correlated with the quantity of plasmid incorporated in each cell. We found no correlation between the intensity of the TOPflash reporter and that of BFP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This suggests that the low and high levels of TOPflash fluorescence observed in DML cells are due to genuine differences in TCF/\u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity. The graph also distinguishes cells that are positive (in red) for the NOTCH reporter from those that are negative (in blue, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). It confirms that the vast majority of NOTCH reporter-positive (and MYF5-positive) cells display a high TCF/\u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity. This is the cell population that will be thoroughly analyzed in this study. The identity of the cell population that displays a low TCF/\u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity (about 60% of the entire TOPflash positive cell population) but is NOTCH reporter- and MYF5-negative will become clear in the following chapters."

To address this, we first co-electroporated the DML with a constitutively active form of \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rios et al., 2010</a>) together with the NOTCH reporter. This did not lead to any change in activity of the NOTCH reporter, compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). In contrast, the co-expression of a constitutively active form of NOTCH1 (NICD [<a href=\"#bib9\">Daudet and Lewis, 2005</a>]) led to rapid and robust increase in the activity of the TOPflash reporter, compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). To further investigate the interrelation between both pathways, we used a dominant-negative form of the NOTCH co-activator Mastermind (DN-MAML1 [<a href=\"#bib50\">Weng et al., 2003</a>]). We previously showed that it strongly inhibits MYF5 expression in the DML (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rios et al., 2011</a>).

To confirm this, we performed double electroporations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). First, we electroporated WNT1 or a dominant-negative form of WNT1 into the dorsal neural tube and the neural crest. WNT1 is predicted to activate WNT1 and WNT3a cognate receptors, while DN WNT1 is believed to act as a competitive inhibitor for both WNT1 and WNT3a (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hoppler et al., 1996</a>). Second, we electroporated the TOPflash reporter and an electroporation control plasmid in somites. This allowed us to quantify the activity of the TOPflash reporter together with the myogenic response (determined by immunostaining for MYF5). We observed that WNT1 and DN WNT1 significantly increased or decreased, respectively, the activity of the TOPflash reporter, compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I\u2013L</a>), but importantly with no visible change to their myogenic response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4M</a>)."

To show this, we inhibited both DLL1 in neural crest and the WNT ligands in the DML, while monitoring the activity of the TOPflash reporter and myogenesis in somites. Compared to controls (no inhibition of DLL1 in the neural crest), this led to a near complete absence of TOPflash reporter activity in DML cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4O,P</a>), which was now accompanied by a robust decrease in their myogenic response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4O,Q</a>)."

The second shows a low TOPflash reporter activity, initiated by WNT ligand transported by neural crest cells but with no sign of myogenesis. These findings prompted a search for a mechanism that could explain how DLL1 can trigger the high TCF/\u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity that is required for the initiation of the myogenic program."

An essential function of SNAI is to repress epithelial gene expression and thereby promote epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) during vertebrate and invertebrate development and metastatic progression of cancers (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barrallo-Gimeno and Nieto, 2005</a>). In early chick embryos, SNAI1 is expressed in the epithelial dermomyotome, including the DML. Its activation leads to the down-regulation of N-cadherin expression present at the adherens junction of epithelial cells located in the central dermomyotome and to their subsequent EMT (<a href=\"#bib10\">Delfini et al., 2009</a>). Coherent with this, the over-expression of SNAI1 in the DML induced a significant increase in the translocation of DML cells into the myotome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), while the inhibition of its function by a SNAI1-specific siRNA (<a href=\"#bib10\">Delfini et al., 2009</a>) inhibited their translocation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Since we showed above that the release of \u03b2-catenin from the AJ is a key event in the activation of MYF5, we tested whether SNAI1 could regulate the activation of MYF5 expression in the DML. The electroporation of SNAI1 in the DML induced a strong activation of MYF5 expression, compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,G</a>). Conversely, the electroporation of a dominant-negative form of SNAIL-1 or an siRNA directed against SNAI1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Delfini et al., 2009</a>) resulted in a significant decrease in MYF5 expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,E,F,G</a>). Finally, we co-electroporated NICD together with the dominant-negative form of SNAI1 and observed that the massive increase in MYF5 expression observed after NICD expression (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rios et al., 2011</a>) was profoundly reduced by DN-SNAI1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,G</a>), thus demonstrating that SNAI1 activation is a necessary step, downstream of NOTCH, in the chain of events that leads to the activation of MYF5 in DML cells."

NICD regulates the transcription of many target genes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fortini, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Guruharsha et al., 2012</a>), including SNAIL (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grego-Bessa et al., 2004</a>). Therefore, we wondered whether this would be the case in the DML. However, the expression of NICD did not result in any significant increase in SNAI1 transcription (as judged by in situ hybridization, data not shown). These results led us to explore alternative mechanisms. SNAI1 mRNA is widely expressed; however, its activity is tightly regulated post-translationally through phosphorylation by GSK-3\u03b2, which leads to its \u03b2-Trcp-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Due to this continuous degradation, SNAI1 protein has a short half-life, estimated to be about 25 min (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhou et al., 2004</a>). We first determined whether NOTCH signaling could modify the stability of SNAI1 in DML cells by electroporating SNAI1 fused to GFP (SNAI1-GFP), alone or in combination with NICD. SNAI1-GFP was used in low concentration, leading to no visible phenotype, e.g. EMT or activation of MYF5, data not shown). In control embryos, GFP was undetectable under UV examination, but faintly visible after immunostaining and confocal examination in electroporated cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In sharp contrast, the co-electroporation of NICD with SNAI1-GFP led to a massive increase in GFP staining in most electroporated cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), suggesting that the activation of NOTCH signaling prevents the degradation of SNAI1 that normally occurs in DML cells."

Taelman and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib47\">Taelman et al., 2010</a>) cleverly designed a GSK-3\u03b2 fluorescent 'biosensor' (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). When GSK-3\u03b2 is active, the biosensor fluorescence is reduced; in contrast, when GSK-3\u03b2 is inactive, its fluorescence is increased. We first determined whether the GSK-3\u03b2 biosensor is active in DML cells, and observed that fluorescence of the biosensor was only detected in a small proportion of electroporated DML cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This observation indicates that in the majority of DML cells under normal, unperturbed conditions, GSK-3\u03b2 is active (i.e. low or no biosensor detectable). However, in a minority of cells, GSK-3\u03b2 is inhibited (i.e. high level of biosensor). To find out the identity of the biosensor-positive cells in normal, unperturbed condition, we performed a series of co-electroporations followed by immunostaining. This showed that the cells in which the fluorescence of the biosensor is observed are those that i) activate the NOTCH reporter (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>), ii) in which SNAI1 is active (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>) and iii) are MYF5-positive (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,E</a>).

For instance, the massive and rapid cell rearrangement that takes place during neural crest formation or gastrulation in vertebrates vertebrate are associated with the acquisition of novel features that are characteristic of neural crest cells or of the forming mesoderm and endoderm, respectively (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barrallo-Gimeno and Nieto, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Joubin and Stern, 1999</a>). Inhibiting EMT in these models profoundly interferes with the associated cell fate changes. A large spectrum of secreted factors belonging to many signaling pathways have been shown to activate EMT. However, these mechanisms are unlikely to trigger at the same time the cell fate changes associated with the cell adhesion changes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barrallo-Gimeno and Nieto, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lamouille et al., 2014</a>). A remarkable aspect of the signaling module described here is that it targets GSK-3\u03b2, the main regulator of SNAI1 stability. In addition, aiming at GSK-3\u03b2 may protect the \u03b2-catenin released during the EMT process from degradation, allowing it to accumulate sufficiently to act as a transcriptional co-factor, thereby resulting in a quasi-automatic coupling of EMT and \u03b2-catenin-dependent cell fate changes. Given the commonality of the key players described here in this paper, it is plausible that the same signaling circuitry could couple EMT to cell fate decisions in a wide variety of epithelia in normal and pathological conditions."

The 'canonical' role of NICD is to act as a co-transcriptional activator together with RBPJ. However, cytosolic interactions of NICD with various molecular partners that result in cellular responses independent of RBPJ, have been described in in vitro experimental settings (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ayaz and Osborne, 2014</a>]), but also in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Le Gall et al., 2008</a>). Our data uncover a novel in vivo function of NOTCH1 that takes place in the cytosol and leads to GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition. It was shown that the transcriptional activity of NICD is modified by its phosphorylation in vitro, probably by GSK-3\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Espinosa et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Foltz et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Schweisguth, 2004</a>). It is therefore not completely surprising that GSK-3\u03b2 and\u00a0NICD could (directly or not) interact in the DML. What is remarkable is the fact that this leads to a decrease in the overall activity of GSK-3\u03b2 that has important consequences for the cell. The mechanisms for this are unknown. A hypothesis is that the response we observed results from a titration of GSK-3\u03b2 kinase activity by NICD that is amplified by the stabilization of SNAI, itself a substrate for this kinase."

It is known that WNT(s) expressed by the dorsal neural tube and transported by neural crest cells regulate the expression of WNT11 in the DML through canonical WNT signaling. WNT11 itself plays an essential role in the oriented elongation of early muscle fibers through planar cell polarity signaling (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gros et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Marcelle et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Serralbo and Marcelle, 2014</a>). It is therefore not surprising to observe a TOPflash activity in DML cells that results from WNT ligand binding. The data presented here suggest that the WNTs carried by neural crest cells induce a low TOPflash response that regulates myotome's organization, but has no influence on MYF5 expression. On the contrary, DLL1, <i>via</i> the signaling module uncovered here, provokes the release of junctional \u03b2-catenin that leads to a high TOPflash response sufficient to trigger myogenesis. The reason for such different cellular responses is only speculative at present. It could be due to varying quantities of \u03b2-catenin entering the nucleus, low when WNT is presented by neural crest cells, high when it is (presumably massively) mobilized from the cell membrane. WNT11 and MYF5 would then be morphogen-like responses of DML cells to varying quantities of \u03b2-catenin. An alternative hypothesis is that of a qualitative difference in the transcriptional activity of \u03b2-catenin when it results from <i>bona fide</i> WNT signaling or when it is mobilized from the cell membrane. Rhee and colleagues have shown that \u03b2-catenin phosphorylated at the AJ on Y489 is transported into the nucleus and is transcriptionally active in vitro (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rhee et al., 2007</a>). It is thus possible that post-translational phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin potentiates or modifies its transcriptional activity, allowing a sharp separation between the WNT-dependent and the NOTCH-dependent cellular responses. This hypothesis is attractive, as it would explain why we did not observe any change in MYF5 expression even when WNT1 was over-expressed in neural crest cells and would also explain why in the presence of the mutant Y489F \u03b2-catenin, endogenous \u03b2-catenin did not rescue MYF5 expression when NICD was over-expressed."

The necessary function of NOTCH in this process (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rios et al., 2011</a>) is confirmed, but the present work demonstrates that the NOTCH signal is a permissive one, while the instructive role is executed by \u03b2-catenin and TCF/LEF. This is in accordance with the role assigned to WNT signaling in somite myogenesis years ago (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borello et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gros et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Munsterberg et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Stern et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tajbakhsh et al., 1998</a>); however, the results presented here shed an entirely novel light on the origin of the signal and the pathway that mediates it.

The association of \u03b2-catenin with proteins partners (\u03b1-catenin and cadherin) at the membrane is regulated by its phosphorylation at highly conserved tyrosine residues 142, 489 and 654 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lilien and Balsamo, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Palka-Hamblin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Rhee et al., 2007</a>). In the neural tissue, the phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin on tyrosine 489 reduces its affinity for N-cadherin and a mutant form of the \u03b2-catenin where this tyrosine is mutated to a phenylalanine (Y489F) cannot be mobilized from the junctional complex (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rhee et al., 2007</a>). In DML cells, where \u03b2-catenin is also associated with N-cadherin (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gros et al., 2005</a>), we hypothesized that cells in which endogenous wild-type \u03b2-catenin was replaced by Y489F mutant \u03b2-catenin would not be able to activate myogenesis. Due to the fast turnover of the junctional complex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baum and Georgiou, 2011</a>), and the rapid degradation of cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin by the APC/Axin destruction complex (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</a>), we speculated that the forced expression of the Y489F mutant \u03b2-catenin would rapidly replace the endogenous wild type (WT) \u03b2-catenin with its mutant counterpart, thereby allowing us to test the role of this variant in the induction of myogenesis. We tested whether the massive up-regulation of MYF5 expression resulting from the constitutive activation of NOTCH signaling (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rios et al., 2011</a>) could be inhibited in presence of the mutant Y489F \u03b2-catenin."

The authors first resolve a previous conundrum in the field to show how Notch and WNT signaling pathways are integrated during myogenesis in the development somite. Interestingly, their results show that Notch triggers release of \u03b2-catenin from adherens junctions to the nucleus to activate MYF5, in a WNT ligand independent manner. This in itself is an important result. Although exchange between membrane and nuclear \u03b2-catenin pools has been previously postulated, this study directly demonstrates this occurrence in vivo. Second, using a GSK-3\u03b2 biosensor, they find that Notch ICD inactivates GSK-3\u03b2, which in turn stabilizes SNAI1, which promotes EMT and also leads to activation of MYF5 expression. Moreover, this activity of NICD is important in the cytosol and independent of transcription."

Similarly, alluding to \"membrane\" \u03b2-catenin in the title and in the text is misleading, as it is release from adhesion complexes in the membrane that allows \u03b2-catenin to fulfill its role in this process. As such, it is the SNAI1-mediated EMT that releases \u03b2-catenin from the membrane. In other words, it is a process mediated by EMT and \u03b2-catenin but independent of WNT ligand and Notch-mediated transcription. It is a very good example of how EMT can influence WNT signalling in a WNT-independent manner, as already suggested by Stemmer et al., Oncogene 2008 and discussed in EMT reviews. As already mentioned, all this is compatible with the model in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, but the title, the Abstract and the text should be written so that the model is readily followed and easy to understand. In general, the manuscript would benefit from text-editing to make it more concise and to the point. The way it is presently written may make it difficult for the non-expert reader."

Why this is the case is speculative. We had a long discussion on this very point with Hans Clevers a few weeks ago. His group published in 2009 a study showing that GSK3\u03b2 is separated into two pools, a minor one (3-5%) that interacts with \u03b2\u2013catenin within the APC complex and a major one that acts with its numerous other targets (e.g. SNAI; Ng et al. JBC, 2009). Coherent with this study, NICD would likely interact with the \"free\" GSK3\u03b2 available in the cytoplasm, blocking its activity (and allowing SNA1 to accumulate). In contrast, the GSK3\u03b2 located within the APC complex could be \"immune\" to interaction with NICD, being already associated with various proteins within the complex. Thus, when NICD is placed in an Y489F setting, WT \u03b2\u2013catenin cannot accumulate enough to drive MYF5 since the APC complex is likely still active."

However, while this observation brings us one step further towards an understanding of NOTCH function in the cytosol, it leaves additional questions unanswered: e.g. we have no indication on whether NOTCH and Akt or GSK3 directly or indirectly interact and what is the consequence of this interaction on the activity of NOTCH itself. We provide a figure of those results to the reviewers to satisfy their curiosity, but because they are preliminary and incomplete, we do not wish to include those results in the manuscript. Because the role of NOTCH we uncovered is potentially of importance in a number of cellular contexts, we think these crucial questions deserve to be addressed in an independent study."

We demonstrated that GPC4 is necessary for the transfer of WNT from neural crest to DML cells. Thus, our results are coherent with those of Farin and colleagues, and in fact it could be that HSPGs are implicated in the cell-cell transfer of WNT they describe in the intestinal crypt.

The fact is, all of them are necessary, and this module works only if all of them are there at the right place and moment. From the comments, it seems that reviewers believe that Snail and EMT are the driving force of myogenesis. In fact, it is easy to understand from the module we describe that the direct activation of MYF5 by CA LEF or CA \u03b2-catenin short-circuits the need for Snail or an EMT. We have done those experiments (they are not shown in the paper), we expectedly observe strong MYF5 activation, but indeed with no propensity of cells to translocate into the myotome, thereby dissociating de facto Snail and the EMT from myogenesis. In fine, the only required molecular event in the module we uncovered is the direct activation of MYF5 expression by \u03b2-catenin and LEF. The steps upstream are merely means to this end."
