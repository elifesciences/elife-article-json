Vesicular traffic functionally connects these individual compartments while preserving their integrity. The constant vectorial exchange between organelles is ensured by a complex machinery that facilitates the formation of vesicles with selective cargo, vesicle movement, specific tethering of each vesicle at its correct target membrane, and fusion of the vesicle and organelle membranes. Selective tethering and fusion are sequential events, but it remains unclear how tightly they are coupled. Tethering is commonly performed by specific proteins, often in large multi-subunit complexes that bind Rab family GTPases (<a href=\"#bib47\">Stenmark, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yu and Hughson, 2010</a>). Fusion is mediated by soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</a>) and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rizo and Sudhof, 2012</a>)."

At steady state, wild-type strains of yeast have just a few large vacuoles, but mutations which block vacuole fusion allow unimpeded fission, resulting in cells with numerous small vacuoles. This phenotype allowed the identification of the genes encoding vacuole fusion proteins (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wada et al., 1992</a>).

Two of these subunits, Vps39p and Vps41p, have direct affinity for Ypt7p, suggesting that one HOPS complex could tether two vacuoles, each bearing Ypt7p (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brett et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ostrowicz et al., 2010</a>). Fusion of tethered membranes requires vacuolar SNAREs. Each vacuole has four SNAREs that are required for homotypic fusion: the R-SNARE Nyv1p, the Q<sub>a</sub>-SNARE Vam3p, the Q<sub>b</sub>-SNARE Vti1p, and the Q<sub>c</sub>-SNARE Vam7p (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nichols et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ungermann et al., 1999</a>).

In an early study, vacuole detergent extracts were reconstituted into proteoliposomes that could fuse with the purified organelle. Both the SNARE complex and vacuolar Rab GTPase Ypt7p were shown to be essential components of such detergent extracts (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sato and Wickner, 1998</a>). Shortly thereafter, it was demonstrated that proteoliposomes bearing the vacuolar R-SNARE and two fluorescent lipids that exhibit fluorescence quenching, NBD-PE and rhodamine-PE, will interact with non-fluorescent proteoliposomes bearing the three Q-SNAREs to give fluorescence dequenching (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fukuda et al., 2000</a>). This finding has since been confirmed in several additional studies (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mima et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Izawa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Furukawa and Mima, 2014</a>). A very recent study (<a href=\"#bib14\">Furukawa and Mima, 2014</a>) has shown that vacuolar SNAREs are apparently unique among the yeast SNAREs, in that the purified SNAREs of the other yeast organelles will not mediate the dequenching of fluorescent lipids on proteoliposomes without additional proteins or tethering factors. In striking contrast, when fusion was assayed by the mixing of lumenally entrapped proteins while they remain inaccessible to an external competitor (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zucchi and Zick, 2011</a>), very little fusion was seen without a tethering agent (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zick and Wickner, 2013</a>). Thus, there are apparently contradictory reports as to whether SNAREs alone can efficiently mediate each stage of the fusion process."

Strikingly, fluorescent lipid dequenching can apparently occur due to <i>trans</i>-SNARE interactions that do not necessarily go on to fusion, emphasizing the pivotal importance of content mixing experiments in membrane fusion studies. A tethering/docking step is strictly required for rapid fusion, whether by the main physiological tethering system of Ypt7p and HOPS or by a vacuole-specific tethering mechanism mediated by the interaction of Vam7p's PX domain and PI(3)P in <i>trans.</i>"

Two principal types of assays have been employed to study this process in reconstituted systems, one based on the mixing of the bilayer lipids, the other based on the mixing of the vesicles' lumenal contents (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Lipid dequenching (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, part 1) has been the most commonly used assay for membrane fusion. In this assay (<a href=\"#bib49\">Struck et al., 1981</a>), one set of proteoliposomes bears two fluorescent lipids while the other has none. The two fluorophores are subject to fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), so that the fluorescence emission of the \u2018donor\u2019 fluorophore is quenched due to its close proximity to the \u2018acceptor\u2019 fluorophore. FRET efficiency varies with the 6th power of the average distance between fluorophores (<a href=\"#bib10\">F\u00f6rster, 1948</a>); thus, fusion to unlabeled proteoliposomes, causing a twofold dilution of fluorescent lipids and thereby an increased average distance between fluorophores, results in a remarkable loss of quenching, and the ensuing increase in donor fluorescence is taken as a measure of fusion. In a modified version of this assay, donor and acceptor fluorophores start out on separate proteoliposome populations, and are brought into close contact when apposed bilayers fuse and their lipids mix (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, part 2). The surrogate for fusion in this case is the decrease in fluorescence intensity of the donor fluorophore (due to quenching by the acceptor fluorophore via FRET). The quenching assay primarily reports the initial round of events, while the signal for the dequenching assay keeps increasing with consecutive rounds (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, hemifusion (a possible intermediate in which only the outer leaflets of apposed bilayers join) and lysis (disruption of the lipid bilayer with a loss of lumenal integrity) and ensuing re-annealing of bilayer fragments could also lead to lipid mixing which would be detected by these assays. Therefore, alternative assays that measure the mixing of lumenal contents in the continuous presence of an external competitor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, part 3), a strategy that has commonly been used to study the fusion of isolated organelles, are important as well."

These proteoliposomes are mixed and incubated with HOPS, Sec17p, Sec18p, Mg<sup>2+</sup>:ATP, and non-fluorescent streptavidin (to block any extra-lumenal association between biotinylated phycoerythrin and Cy5-streptavidin that might have been released by lysis). To measure both fusion and lysis, assays were also performed without added non-fluorescent streptavidin. In assays in which proteoliposomes bear each of the four SNAREs, as on the organelle itself, dequenching of the lipidic fluorophores (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), lumenal compartment mixing which is continuously protected from external streptavidin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), and content mixing plus lysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) required HOPS, Sec17p, and Sec18p (for this and subsequent figures, the extent of fusion after 10 min was used to estimate fusion activity; representative examples of kinetic data are shown as figure supplements)."

Such an arrangement has allowed the study of sub-reactions with reduced complexity. We therefore prepared proteoliposomes as before (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), but instead of bearing all four SNAREs, one fusion partner had only the R-SNARE Nyv1p and the other bore the 3Q-SNAREs. Surprisingly, these proteoliposomes showed very limited protected lumenal compartment mixing in the absence of other proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, column 1), although even this very limited fusion was blocked by Sec17p/Sec18p (column 5) and thus likely required direct <i>trans</i>-SNARE interaction. Substantial fusion only occurred in the presence of HOPS and, as noted before (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mima et al., 2008</a>), was further enhanced by Sec17p/Sec18p in addition to HOPS (columns 4 and 8). In contrast to the dependence of content mixing on HOPS, there was substantial lipid dequenching without the addition of HOPS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, column 1), as reported (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mima et al., 2008</a>). To address this discrepancy, we turned to a more detailed analysis of the lipid dequenching assay."

Proteoliposomes were prepared with both MB-PE and NBD-PE on the R-SNARE proteoliposomes or on the 3Q-SNARE proteoliposomes. Strikingly, the dequenching signal was seen when the fluorescent lipids were both on the R-SNARE proteoliposomes, but not when they were on the 3Q-SNARE proteoliposomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, dark gray bars). For these direct comparisons of dequenching when the fluorophores are on one or the other proteoliposome, the proteoliposomes were mixed at a 1:1 ratio (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As in most reported dequenching assays, increasing the proportion of non-fluorescent acceptor 3Q-SNARE proteoliposomes enhances the signal such that up to 60% of maximal dequenching is achieved in 10 min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, light gray columns), whereas little dequenching of fluorescent 3Q-SNARE proteoliposomes is seen when incubated with even a 16-fold excess of non-fluorescent 1R-proteoliposomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, dark gray columns). Providing an excess of 3Q-RPLs, but not 1R-RPLs, also promoted content mixing (see <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) beyond what was seen at a 1:1 ratio of both RPLs, suggesting that only a fraction of the 3Q-RPLs are fusion competent. Dequenching does require <i>trans</i>-SNARE interactions: it is blocked by antibody to Vam3p, by recombinant soluble domain of Nyv1p, or by Sec17p/Sec18p (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, light gray columns), which are reported (<a href=\"#bib59\">Xu et al., 2010</a>) to disassemble <i>trans</i>-SNARE complexes. Each of the 14 compositions of SNAREs other than 3Q on the acceptor, non-fluorescent proteoliposomes did not support dequenching (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, the average and standard deviation of these is shown for simplicity as a dark gray column). Thus, proteoliposomes can undergo <i>trans</i>-SNARE interactions that lead to asymmetric lipid dequenching without symmetrical lipid mixing or proportionate fusion."

Was this fusion independent of tethering, that is, did it rely on direct formation of stable proteoliposome adherence through 4-SNARE coiled-coil domain assembly, or did another kind of interaction mediate tethering? The Vam7p N-terminal PX domain has direct affinity for PI(3)P (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheever et al., 2001</a>), which is important for fusion (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fratti and Wickner, 2007</a>). 3Q- and 1R-proteoliposomes were prepared with or without PI(3)P. They were incubated in each combination without further protein addition, with HOPS, with Sec17p/Sec18p, or with HOPS/Sec17p/Sec18p, and their protected lumenal compartment mixing was assayed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Strikingly, with PI(3)P only on the R-SNARE proteoliposomes, fusion was as vigorous without HOPS as in its presence (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, columns 5 and 7). This fusion was blocked by Sec17p/Sec18p (column 6) and was not seen when the PI(3)P was entirely absent (column 1) or when PI(3)P was only on the 3Q-SNARE proteoliposomes (column 9). The content mixing that was seen when PI(3)P was on the R-SNARE proteoliposomes alone was strongly suppressed when PI(3)P was present on the 3Q-RPLs as well (columns 5 vs 13), presumably because the PX domain is engaged in an interaction with PI(3)P in <i>cis,</i> rendering a <i>trans</i> interaction less likely. The delay in reaction kinetics for conditions with Sec17, Sec18, and HOPS and no PI(3)P on the 3Q-RPLs (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>, purple lines) probably reflects the requirement for phosphoinositides for the synergy between Sec17/Sec18 and HOPS (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mima and Wickner, 2009</a>). The fusion that is supported by the presence of PI(3)P on the R-SNARE proteoliposomes can be ascribed to its binding in <i>trans</i> by the PX domain of Vam7p, as 3Q-SNARE proteoliposomes which were made with Vam7p\u0394PX will not fuse with R-SNARE proteoliposomes which bear PI(3)P (column 17). After 10 min assays, the very low lumenal compartment mixing values observed with the RPLs alone were not significantly above those seen with inhibition by Sec17p and Sec18p (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, lower panel, columns 1 and 2). To determine whether SNARE-bearing RPLs alone can undergo any full fusion at all on their own, we performed an extended fusion assay with 3Q- and 1R-proteoliposomes without PI(3)P in the presence or absence of added HOPS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Detectable fusion could in fact be supported by SNAREs alone (blue), albeit at less than a 100th the rate as seen in the presence of HOPS (red)."

                                "text": "Does this dramatic difference in fusion rates reflect a proportionate inability of the three Q-SNAREs on proteoliposomes to engage with R-SNAREs in the absence of a tether? To study how much <i>trans</i>-interaction occurs between membrane-bound 3Q-SNAREs and membrane-bound R-SNAREs in the presence or absence of HOPS, we performed a content mixing reaction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and also subjected samples which had been detergent-solubilized to immunoprecipitation with anti-Vam3p antibodies to determine the amount of Nyv1p that co-precipitated as a measure of <i>trans</i>-SNARE interaction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The detergent bore a large excess of GST-Nyv1p, sufficient to suppress any association between the 3Q-SNAREs and wild-type Nyv1p after detergent-solubilization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The presence of HOPS led to an increase in the <i>trans</i>-association of membrane anchored SNAREs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, compare lanes 3 and 4). However, this increase was less than fourfold, and thus insufficient to explain the difference in content mixing rates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Quantitation of replicate experiments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) shows that about one third as much <i>trans</i>-SNARE complex formed in the absence of HOPS (column 3) as in its presence (column 4), whereas fusion was over 100 times faster in the presence of HOPS (columns 1, 2). Might this reflect an inability of the 3Q-SNAREs to interact with Nyv1p without HOPS? When incubations bore the recombinant soluble domain of Nyv1p at the same 100 nM concentration as was otherwise present on RPLs in our assay, the soluble Nyv1p readily bound to the Q-SNAREs regardless of the presence or absence of HOPS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, compare lanes 7 and 8). Furthermore, 100 nM soluble Nyv1p can suppress most of the content mixing reaction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), just as fusion was blocked by the mixed soluble domains of the three Q-SNAREs (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), and inhibition by added soluble domain of Nyv1p was reversible by including the SNARE complex disassembly chaperones Sec17/Sec18 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). This indicates that the 3Q-SNARE complexes were capable of engaging in complex formation with membrane-bound R-SNAREs, but in a manner that did not lead to fusion. To test whether the highly disproportional increase in <i>trans</i>-SNARE association and content mixing can be attributed to a possible requirement for high cooperativity of SNARE complexes, we examined the levels of content mixing and <i>trans</i>-SNARE interactions when R-RPLs were used that had been reconstituted with lower amounts of Nyv1p (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Lower levels of Nyv1p did not lead to a drastic diminution of fusion activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>), but resulted in lower amounts of <i>trans</i>-SNARE association (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,D</a>). Since the amount of <i>trans</i>-SNARE interaction that was detected at low Nyv1p levels with HOPS was lower than the amount seen with high Nyv1p levels without HOPS (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,D</a>, lane 2 vs lane 7), yet the amount of fusion was drastically higher in the sample containing HOPS (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>, lane 2 vs lane 7), the requirement for high cooperativity can be ruled out as an explanation for the observed discrepancy between increases in <i>trans</i>-SNARE interaction and fusion."

Most studies with isolated organelles have assayed fusion as the mixing of lumenal contents. Studies with reconstituted proteoliposomes, in contrast, have relied heavily on lipid dequenching assays to infer the merging of two lipid bilayers. Discrepancies of lipid mixing and content mixing have repeatedly been noted in the past: for example, neuronal SNAREs alone do not produce much content mixing yet readily promote lipid dequenching (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kyoung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Diao et al., 2012</a>), content mixing occurs seconds after initial lipid mixing in influenza virus-induced fusion (<a href=\"#bib9\">Floyd et al., 2008</a>), and content mixing occurs with a delay of several minutes after lipid mixing in vacuolar fusion (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jun and Wickner, 2007</a>)."

We have reconstituted a fusion reaction that mimics the homotypic fusion of yeast vacuoles, that is, with the four SNAREs in a <i>cis</i>-complex on both membranes, depending on Sec17p/Sec18p for ATP-dependent priming and Ypt7p:HOPS for tethering (see <a href=\"#bib57\">Wickner, 2010</a> for review). Both content and lipid mixing assays show that this reaction requires Sec17p, Sec18p, and HOPS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). A modified reaction scheme, in which one population of RPLs bears the R-SNARE Nyv1p, while the other population bears the three Q-SNAREs Vam3p, Vti1p, and Vam7p, allows study of a sub-reaction that bypasses the need for Sec17p/Sec18p mediated priming. This condition has repeatedly been reported to allow lipid mixing to occur without the need for any additional components (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fukuda et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mima et al., 2008</a>). While we could reproduce this finding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, column 1), we observed a substantially lower amount of content mixing for the same condition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, column 1). Furthermore, among the several sets of SNAREs of yeast organelles, only the vacuolar SNAREs showed a purported fusion signal (<a href=\"#bib20\">Izawa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Furukawa and Mima, 2014</a>). Lipid mixing without proportional content mixing may indicate hemifusion (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, the lipid dequenching signal showed an asymmetric character, depending on the two fluorescent lipids being present on the R-SNARE-bearing RPLs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). It is nevertheless possible to suppress this signal with well-established inhibitors of fusion that interfere with the formation of <i>trans</i>-SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The fluorescent lipids did not appear to modulate the capacity of RPLs to fuse, as content mixing was not affected by the presence or distribution of fluorescent lipids (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The effect was also not limited to a specific set of fluorescent lipids (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We cannot explain this asymmetric behavior, but it may be related to an undefined interaction between vacuolar SNAREs and the fluorescent lipids. The latter might be selectively transferred to another membrane that contains a particular SNARE via an interaction with that SNARE; transfer of lipid dyes between membranes has been reported for rhodamine B lipids (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ohki et al., 1998</a>). Basic residues in the juxtamembrane regions of a Q-SNARE might facilitate transfer of the fluorescent lipids from the R-RPLs when the two membranes are brought into proximity by <i>trans</i>-SNARE complex assembly, thus catalyzing transfer from the R- to the 3Q-RPLs. In any case, the lipid mixing assay needs to be employed with great caution, and should ideally only serve as a complement to content mixing experiments. Lipid dequenching has provided many valuable lessons, but can apparently report events other than true fusion."

The small amount of content mixing in 1R-3Q reactions that was seen without added protein was suppressed by the addition of Sec17p/Sec18p (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, compare columns 1 and 5), indicating that it did indeed represent SNARE-dependent true membrane fusion. A previous report has shown that the <i>trans</i>-interaction of PI(3)P and the PX domain of the Qc-SNARE Vam7p could promote tethering (<a href=\"#bib60\">Xu and Wickner, 2010</a>). This interaction was partially responsible for the SNARE-dependent content mixing seen without additional proteins, since the complete absence of PI(3)P, its asymmetric disposition on 3Q-RPLs, or a truncated form of Vam7p lacking its PX domain further reduced the small amount of content mixing seen without HOPS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In contrast, when PI(3)P was only present on R-SNARE RPLs, rapid fusion did not require HOPS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, columns 5 and 6), establishing a condition with reduced complexity in which an SM function is not absolutely required. It remains to be determined whether the Vam7p:PI(3)P tethering plays any role on intact vacuoles, where priming releases Vam7p early in the fusion reaction (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boeddinghaus et al., 2002</a>), or if it is merely a phenomenon seen in in vitro reconstitutions with purified components. In this context, we note that the content mixing supported by Vam7p:PI(3)P tethering is fully suppressed in the presence of Sec17p/Sec18p (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, column 6). The ubiquitous presence of Sec17p/Sec18p in the cell may underlie a strict requirement for HOPS and other large tethering complexes in vivo. HOPS has the capacity to recruit Vam7p (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zick and Wickner, 2013</a>), to proofread <i>trans</i>-SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Starai et al., 2008</a>), and to protect them from disassembly by Sec17p/Sec18p (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hickey and Wickner, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Xu et al., 2010</a>)."

Colliding SNARE-bearing membranes form spontaneous <i>trans</i>-SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, lane 3). These can occasionally trigger fusion, but the rate achieved under such a condition is of questionable physiological relevance. This uncertainty is reinforced by the fact that mutations in Rab GTPases or tethering complexes have as strong a phenotype as mutations in SNARE proteins (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wada et al., 1992</a>). The addition of HOPS stimulates the fusion reaction more than 100-fold, yet it only increases the amount of <i>trans</i>-SNARE interaction a few-fold (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). This shows that the role of HOPS and tethering goes beyond merely facilitating <i>trans</i>-SNARE complex formation. The <i>trans</i>-SNARE complexes that form spontaneously are very inefficient in catalyzing membrane fusion. This indicates that it is not just a matter of quantity, but that additional factors are important to produce <i>trans</i>-SNARE interaction of the right quality to facilitate membrane fusion. Fusion-incompetent SNARE complexes have been observed in other systems (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib6\">Brunger, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rizo and Sudhof, 2012</a>), and it will be crucial to determine what differentiates a productive from a non-productive complex, and what aids the formation of one over the other. Our findings do not vitiate the central role of <i>trans</i>-SNARE complexes in fusion; rather, they reveal that a distinct tethering step is a critical upstream event that substantially increases the rate of SNARE-mediated fusion, as suggested (<a href=\"#bib45\">Smith and Weisshaar, 2011</a>), and its mode of action is not limited to increasing the quantity of <i>trans</i>-SNARE pairings."

However, another study (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ohya et al., 2009</a>), which employed a content mixing assay to measure fusion, found that a Rab GTPase and its effectors are essential for endosomal SNARE-mediated fusion. Neuronal fusion has also been extensively studied through in vitro reconstitution, and led to the concept that SNAREs alone suffice as the machinery of fusion (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</a>). While SNAREs are undoubtedly essential components, their spontaneous assembly into a four-helical bundle only occurs very slowly (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pobbati et al., 2006</a>). Vital components that accelerate this assembly are more recently being included in the definition of a core machinery in this system.

The highly selective distribution of each Rab GTPase, which serves as a receptor for its cognate tethering complex (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hutagalung and Novick, 2011</a>), could impose specificity on otherwise promiscuous SNARE complex assembly (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yang et al., 1999</a>). Membrane repulsion and the conformation of unpaired, membrane-anchored SNAREs may limit the spontaneous formation of <i>trans</i>-SNARE complexes. Bringing membranes into close apposition and stabilizing such a tethered intermediate drastically enriches the local concentration of SNAREs and facilitates the interactions that promote <i>trans</i>-SNARE complex formation. Recent studies suggested that some multi-subunit tethering complexes could also directly modulate the assembly of functional SNARE complexes (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib18\">Hong and Lev, 2014</a>). Nevertheless, even in a tethered state, only a minor fraction (a few percent) of SNAREs seem to engage in such complexes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mima et al., 2008</a>) and lowering the SNARE concentration only a few-fold can take a substantial toll on fusion activity (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zick et al., 2014</a>). Other factors that promote fusion, like Sec17p and Sec18p, further stimulate HOPS-dependent reactions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mima et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mima and Wickner, 2009</a>), but their mode of action is only poorly understood. The observation that Sec17p/Sec18p relieved the inhibition by soluble SNARE proteins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) demonstrates the importance of dynamic cycling of SNARE interactions, and highlights the ability of HOPS to selectively protect productive <i>trans</i>-SNARE pairs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Starai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hickey and Wickner, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Xu et al., 2010</a>)."

HOPS mediates tethering (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hickey and Wickner, 2010</a>), possibly supported by the <i>trans</i>-interaction of the PX domain of Vam7p with PI(3)P (<a href=\"#bib60\">Xu and Wickner, 2010</a>). Neuronal SNAREs can associate in multiple conformations (<a href=\"#bib56\">Weninger et al., 2003</a>) that can participate in docking (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bowen et al., 2004</a>). Similarly, the vacuolar SNAREs may associate in several conformations when pairing in <i>trans.</i> Additional factors that guide the formation of fusion-competent complexes, which might differ from fusion-incompetent complexes in composition, conformation, or associations, are required for rapid fusion. Our data indicate that tethering via HOPS or the binding of the Vam7p PX domain to PI(3)P in <i>trans</i> can provide such guidance. Earlier studies of intact vacuoles have also shown that the rate of fusion is not directly proportional to the level of <i>trans</i>-SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ungermann et al., 1998</a>), suggesting that only a fraction of <i>trans</i>-SNARE interactions might also contribute to fusion activity in vivo."

Tethering could provide the activation energy required for partially assembled SNARE complexes to fully zipper (<a href=\"#bib33\">Min et al., 2013</a>). It could also contribute by inducing membrane bending at the edges of tightly apposed membranes <span class=\"underline\">(</span><a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2002</a><span class=\"underline\">)</span>.

Fusogenic lipids, such as the non-bilayer lipids phosphatidylethanolamine, diacylglycerol, and sterol, are required for fusion (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zick et al., 2014</a>) and are dependent on other lipids and docking proteins for their enrichment at the vertex ring (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fratti et al., 2004</a>). We propose that tethering may thus make several direct contributions to fusion, as well as its role in promoting <i>trans</i>-SNARE complexes in conjunction with additional auxiliary proteins."

This work now adds even more rather unsettling evidence that lipid-dye dequenching assays should be treated with caution. The authors find that lipid-dye dequenching is asymmetric in their system, i.e., (de-) quenching occurs much more extensively when lipid dyes are included with one class of vesicles containing R-SNAREs than when they are included with vesicles containing Q-SNAREs. This asymmetry is not due merely to some unusual property of the particular type of fluorescence lipids chosen, since the authors show that analogous results were obtained with three different types of fluorescent lipids. Moreover, the data suggest that the observed dequenching of the lipid dyes is not due to complete fusion. A second key finding is that the tethering of HOPS on the vacuolar SNARE-bearing proteoliposomes initiates efficient lumenal compartment mixing. However, placing PI3P in the R-SNARE liposomes, vacuolar SNAREs alone can also induce efficient content mixing without HOPS."

The authors rightfully say \u201cWe do not know how trans-SNARE interactions lead to this dequenching, but it is not symmetric, as expected for true lipid mixing, and is not proportionate to the content mixing for each reaction condition; thus, it cannot be relied on as a faithful reporter of fusion.\u201d What is the origin of the asymmetric lipid dye transfer? The authors should suggest a mechanism, especially since fusion inhibitors suppress the signal. In particular, could this be related to some sort of interaction between some of the vacuolar SNAREs, PI(3)P, and the dyes themselves? In other words, dye-lipids may be transferred to the other membrane that contains a particular SNARE via an interaction with that SNARE? In this context, transfer of lipid dyes between membranes has been previously observed (S. Ohki, T. D. Flanagan, and D. Hoekstra, Biochemistry, 1998, 37, 7496-503) for Rhodamine B lipids. Moreover, is it plausible that positively charged residues in the juxtamembrane regions of the Q SNAREs help to 'extract' the fluorescent lipids from the R-liposomes when the two membranes are brought into proximity by the trans SNARE complexes, thus catalyzing transfer from the R- to the Q-liposomes? Another (albeit, less interesting) possibility that could explain their data is a different size distribution of vesicles and unequal dye partitioning. For example, if the R-SNARE vesicles are much smaller than the Q-SNARE vesicles, then the lipid dyes may partition non-randomly between leaflets in the R-SNARE vesicles but not in the Q-SNARE vesicles (e.g. one could have a much higher concentration of dyes in the outer leaflet of the R-SNARE vesicles than in the Q-SNARE vesicles). Then, upon hemifusion, there would be a greater fluorescence change if the dyes were in the R-SNARE vesicle originally than in the Q-SNARE vesicle. Small amounts of hemi-fusion would appear magnified in that case. Alternatively, there could be some interaction between the R-SNARE proteins and the lipid dye which make it undergo hemifusion more readily than if the dye is on the Q-SNARE vesicles."

How can this be explained? Since an important aspect of this paper is the asymmetry observed in lipid mixing, it is important to establish whether the differences in the content mixing results constitute a true asymmetry or arise from differences in the amounts of probes trapped in the proteoliposomes in the different configurations. The authors should discuss this point and, ideally, should provide some characterization of the proteoliposomes to distinguish between these possibilities."

Because no kinetic data is shown for most figures, the differences in the data could be due to either different rates or different extents of fusion or both. In turn, that might suggest different underlying mechanisms. Showing the kinetic data, even if only in the supporting material, would be very useful. One of the principal advantages of doing bulk phase fusion experiments is that it is much easier and quicker to collect kinetic data, so why not exploit that?"

That may very well be true, but might not the data herein also support the idea that the action of HOPS is merely to stabilize the Q-SNAREs in a fusion-competent configuration such that they can mediate both tethering and fusion? Q-SNAREs in other systems are well known to form dead-end complexes that are not fusion competent (see, for example, reviews by Brunger, A.T. (2006) Quart. Rev. Biophys. 38,1-47. and Rizo, J., and S\u00fcdhof, T.C. (2012). Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology 28, 279-308.). Might that be what is going on here? The authors suggest that only a fraction of their Q-SNARE vesicles seem to be fusion-competent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, and in the text). Perhaps the essential role of HOPS in their experiments is not to tether the two membranes, but rather to stabilize Q-SNARE complexes in a fusion-competent configuration. Or perhaps both mechanisms of action are essential. The PI(3)P experiments in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> partially address this question, but as the SNAREs are known to interact with PI(3)P, it may be that PI(3)P also stabilizes the fusion-competent configuration. Outside of single vesicle fusion experiments, which can easily visualize the tethering step, what is really needed is an experiment in which the vesicles are tethered in a manner independent of any of the fusion machinery. In a simplistic way, this could be done by using the same streptavidin tethering experiment as was used to collect the data in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, but using the yeast SNAREs and Ypt7p instead of the rat SNAREs (see note 7 below). Also, content mixing rather than lipid mixing should be used as a fusion readout in that experiment (see note 5)."

However, all the data shown in the figure rely on a lipid-mixing assay. Hence, reliable conclusions from about membrane fusion cannot be drawn, given all problems inherent to interpret lipid mixing data. It is also unclear why the data are presented as rate of fluorescence decrease, in contrast to other figures of the paper. In addition, the data have large error bars and some reactions with an incomplete group of SNAREs (e.g. 1R 1R) yield a substantial effect that is about 30-40% of that obtained with 3Q and 1R. Therefore, these results are far from demonstrating that tethering is required for endosomal membrane fusion. The data could be omitted as they are not central to the key points of this paper, or a proper content mixing assay used, such as Tb3+-DPA or ANTS-DPX that should work nicely."

In effect, they might clog up the interface. Is streptavidin added at a low enough concentration that this can be ruled out? What do the authors think is going on here?"

In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, when PI3P is only on the R SNARE vesicles (mimicking the tethering action of HOPS), then similar levels of fusion are observed with and without HOPS.

If HOPS is also involved in stabilizing a fusion competent conformation of snare proteins or influencing fusion through some other action, then shouldn't there be an increase in fusion when HOPS is added? The authors should reconcile their interpretation of the data with this point."

The authors rightfully say \u201cWe do not know how trans-SNARE interactions lead to this dequenching, but it is not symmetric, as expected for true lipid mixing, and is not proportionate to the content mixing for each reaction condition; thus, it cannot be relied on as a faithful reporter of fusion.\u201d. What is the origin of the asymmetric lipid dye transfer? The authors should suggest a mechanism, especially since fusion inhibitors suppress the signal. In particular, could this be related to some sort of interaction between some of the vacuolar SNAREs, PI(3)P, and the dyes themselves? In other words, dye-lipids may be transferred to the other membrane that contains a particular SNARE via an interaction with that SNARE? In this context, transfer of lipid dyes between membranes has been previously observed (S. Ohki, T. D. Flanagan, and D. Hoekstra, Biochemistry, 1998, 37, 7496-503) for Rhodamine B lipids. Moreover, is it plausible that positively charged residues in the juxtamembrane regions of the Q SNAREs help to 'extract' the fluorescent lipids from the R-liposomes when the two membranes are brought into proximity by the trans SNARE complexes, thus catalyzing transfer from the R- to the Q-liposomes? Another (albeit, less interesting) possibility that could explain their data is a different size distribution of vesicles and unequal dye partitioning. For example, if the R-SNARE vesicles are much smaller than the Q-SNARE vesicles, then the lipid dyes may partition non-randomly between leaflets in the R-SNARE vesicles but not in the Q-SNARE vesicles (e.g. one could have a much higher concentration of dyes in the outer leaflet of the R-SNARE vesicles than in the Q-SNARE vesicles). Then, upon hemifusion, there would be a greater fluorescence change if the dyes were in the R-SNARE vesicle originally than in the Q-SNARE vesicle. Small amounts of hemi-fusion would appear magnified in that case. Alternatively, there could be some interaction between the R-SNARE proteins and the lipid dye which make it undergo hemifusion more readily than if the dye is on the Q-SNARE vesicles</i>."

That may very well be true, but might not the data herein also support the idea that the action of HOPS is merely to stabilize the Q-SNAREs in a fusion-competent configuration such that they can mediate both tethering and fusion? Q-SNAREs in other systems are well known to form dead-end complexes that are not fusion competent (see, for example, reviews by Brunger, A.T. (2006) Quart. Rev. Biophys. 38,1-47. and Rizo, J., and S\u00fcdhof, T.C. (2012). Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology 28, 279-308.)</i>. <i>Might that be what is going on here?

Perhaps the essential role of HOPS in their experiments is not to tether the two membranes, but rather to stabilize Q-SNARE complexes in a fusion-competent configuration. Or perhaps both mechanisms of action are essential. The PI(3)P experiments in</i> <a href=\"#fig5\"><i>Figure 5</i></a> <i>partially address this question, but as the SNAREs are known to interact with PI(3)P, it may be that PI(3)P also stabilizes the fusion-competent configuration. Outside of single vesicle fusion experiments, which can easily visualize the tethering step, what is really needed is an experiment in which the vesicles are tethered in a manner independent of any of the fusion machinery. In a simplistic way, this could be done by using the same streptavidin tethering experiment as was used to collect the data in</i> <a href=\"#fig6\"><i>Figure 6</i></a><i>, but using the yeast SNAREs and Ypt7p instead of the rat SNAREs (see note 7 below).

Adding HOPS increases the amount of trans-SNARE interaction only a few fold, while it increases the rate of fusion much more dramatically (&gt; 100-fold). This suggests that trans-SNARE interactions can be of different qualities, some fusion-competent, some not. Future work will have to delineate the multiple functions of HOPS, and will also provide further insight into what defines a tethering event.
