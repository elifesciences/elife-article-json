We mapped the spatial organization of glutamatergic synapses between layer 5 pyramidal cells by combining optogenetics and 2-photon calcium imaging in mouse neocortical slices. To mathematically characterize the organization of inputs we developed an approach based on combinatorial analysis of the likelihoods of specific synapse arrangements. We found that the synapses of intralaminar inputs form clusters on the basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal cells. These clusters contain 4 to 14 synapses within \u226430 \u00b5m of dendrite. According to the spatiotemporal characteristics of synaptic summation, these numbers suggest that there will be non-linear dendritic integration of synaptic inputs during synchronous activation."

We mapped the spatial organization of glutamatergic synapses between layer 5 pyramidal cells by combining optogenetics and 2-photon calcium imaging in mouse neocortical slices. To mathematically characterize the organization of inputs we developed an approach based on combinatorial analysis of the likelihoods of specific synapse arrangements. We found that the synapses of intralaminar inputs form clusters on the basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal cells. These clusters contain 4 to 14 synapses within \u226430 \u00b5m of dendrite. According to the spatiotemporal characteristics of synaptic summation, these numbers suggest that there will be non-linear dendritic integration of synaptic inputs during synchronous activation."

G\u00f6k\u00e7e et al. used mice that had been genetically engineered to produce these proteins in specific neurons, and then deliberately triggered electrical activity simply by shining light on these neurons. The experiments also used another technique called two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of single synapses in response to the electrical activity triggered by optogenetics."

Further experiments are now needed to map the synapses between other kinds of neurons, and to map synapses from two different inputs at the same time."

Thus knowing the connectivity of neurons with single synapse resolution is essential to understand how synaptic integration at the cellular level contributes to neural circuit function. One type of spatial organization is of particular interest. These are clusters of synaptic inputs, which can give rise to superlinear summation during synchronous activity (e.g. <a href=\"#bib9\">DeBello et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Larkum and Nevian, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mel, 1993</a>). Clustering has been reported for synchronously active synapses during spontaneous activity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kleindienst et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Takahashi et al., 2012</a>), for synapses undergoing plasticity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Makino and Malinow, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">McBride et al., 2008</a>) as well as for synapses from anatomically defined populations of presynaptic neurons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Druckmann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Rah et al., 2013</a>). However, the cluster parameters relevant for dendritic computations are not rigorously and quantitatively assessed. Furthermore, in different cortical areas the patterns of synapses activated by sensory stimulation suggest that inputs onto central neurons may not be clustered (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Jia et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Varga et al., 2011</a>). Here we address two issues: First, we explore the spatial arrangement of synapses of an anatomically defined intracortical connection, i.e. the intralaminar connection between layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Secondly, we analyze the spatial organization of synapses with a novel method for identifying individual synapse clusters. This allows characterizing cluster parameters, such as dendritic length and number of inputs, in order to put them into the perspective of the rules of dendritic integration and the arithmetic of synaptic summation (e.g. <a href=\"#bib6\">Branco and H\u00e4usser, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Polsky et al., 2004</a>)."

                        "text": "For mapping the synapses between layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cells in mouse\u00a0primary visual cortex (V1) we combined optogenetics and 2-photon calcium imaging (<a href=\"#bib20\">Little and Carter, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">MacAskill et al., 2012</a>), which we refer to as <i>Channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-assisted synapse identity mapping</i> (CASIM). The principle of CASIM is depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>: NMDA receptor mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals identify those dendritic spines on a postsynaptic neuron, which receive input from photostimulated presynaptic neurons expressing ChR2. CASIM has the advantage over other methods for mapping synapses by light or electron microscopy (e.g. <a href=\"#bib11\">Druckmann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Rah et al., 2013</a>) that it identifies synapses in functional rather than only in structural or molecular terms. For presynaptic expression of ChR2, we used transgenic mice expressing ChR2-YFP under control of the THY1 promoter in L5 pyramidal cells (line 18; <a href=\"#bib41\">Wang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Expression levels and stimulus sensitivity were different from cell to cell. High photostimulus intensities evoked electrical responses in all probed L5 pyramidal cells. Because in more sensitive cells the number of generated action potentials dropped with higher stimulus intensities, we applied an intermediate stimulus intensity for synapse mapping, which evoked action potentials in 58% of L5 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig1s2\">2</a>). For synapse mapping we selected layer 5 pyramidal cells with no detectable ChR2-YFP fluorescence, indicating that the levels of ChR2 expression are so low that the selected stimulus intensity is insufficient to cause significant depolarization. For recording calcium signals in spines of postsynaptic L5 pyramidal cells, we patched and filled cells with Alexa 594 (30 \u00b5M) and Fluo-5F (1\u2009mM) in acute slices. In order to isolate NMDA receptor mediated calcium signals and prevent spreading of unspecific excitation, patched cells were depolarized to 10 mV above the NMDAR reversal potential in voltage clamp in extracellular solution containing NBQX (10 \u00b5M), picrotoxin (50 \u00b5M) and D-serine (10 \u00b5M). Synapses between pairs of L5 pyramidal cells are reported to be located to a large extend on the proximal basal dendrite of the postsynaptic cell (<a href=\"#bib24\">Markram et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sjostr\u00f6m and H\u00e4usser, 2006</a>). Therefore we focused on the basal dendrites of L5 pyramidal cells to map their inputs from other L5 pyramidal cells. Basal dendritic branches were systematically scanned with overlapping rectangular tiles of 2-photon calcium imaging to probe all spines for photostimulus-evoked calcium signals. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> shows a sequence of calcium imaging frames zoomed in on two spines, where the left spine shows a clear synaptic calcium signal. Due to the stochastic nature of neurotransmitter release, it is not expected that each AP leads to transmitter release. Thus we classified spines as receiving L5 input if they displayed at least once a higher (\u22653\u00d7standard deviation) and earlier peak calcium signal evoked by photostimulation than observed in the parent dendrite (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D - 1G</a>). In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> L5 input positive (L5+) spines are marked by white arrowheads on a dendritic stretch. In total, out of 2168 analyzed spines, 199 were L5 input positive (9.2%, n\u00a0=\u00a020 cells). The average peak calcium signal amplitude in successful trials (\u0394G/R = 0.48 \u00b1 0.01) was significantly higher than the calcium signal in the parent dendrite (\u0394G/R=0.18 \u00b1 0.005, p&lt;0.001, n\u00a0=\u00a0199 spines; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). There was no significant difference in the morphological properties of L5+ spines and L5 input negative (L5-) spines (length: L5+, 1.23 \u00b1 0.06\u2009\u03bcm, n\u00a0=\u00a076; L5-, 1.11 \u00b1 0.02\u2009\u03bcm, n\u00a0=\u00a0419; p=0.04; normalized volume: L5+, 1.00 \u00b1 0.08, n\u00a0=\u00a077; L5-, 1.00 \u00b1 0.03, n\u00a0=\u00a0437; p=0.97; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>)."

Calibration curves were acquired at 2 (left) and 5 ms (right) pulse width on L5 pyramidal neurons selected blindly (n\u00a0=\u00a012). Number of APs was measured in cell-attached mode. The mean overall calibration curves (blue) did not show a uniform increase with photostimulation power, but a declining AP yield at high powers. To analyze whether this may be explained by potential adverse effects of strong photostimulation on strongly driven neurons, we analyzed the calibration curves with respect to two populations of neurons: Strongly excitable neurons (with more than one AP on average at 1, 2 and 4 mW power; black; dashed, individual cells; solid, mean curve; n\u00a0=\u00a04 cells at 2 ms pulse width, n\u00a0=\u00a05 cells at 5 ms pulse width) showed saturation above 4 mW power with 2 ms pulse width and reduced activity at high illumination intensity at 5 ms pulse width. Weakly excitable neurons (gray; dashed, individual cells; solid, mean curve; n\u00a0=\u00a08 cells at 2 ms pulse width, n\u00a0=\u00a07 cells at 5 ms pulse width) were not affected adversely by illumination. Therefore for mapping, we chose 2 ms pulses at 4 mW as stimulus, which activates but does not overexcite weakly and strongly excitable neurons, respectively. Error bars correspond to standard deviation."

These clusters extend over roughly 15\u2009\u03bcm with, on average, approximately 8 spines (dendritic length, 12.52 \u00b1 2.40\u2009\u03bcm; 7.17 \u00b1 0.94 L5+ spines; density, 0.84 \u00b1 0.19 L5+ spines/\u03bcm; ratio of L5+ over all spines within the cluster, 0.48 \u00b1 0.04; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>; n = 12 clusters). Almost 50% of all L5+ spines were part of a cluster (86 out of 199). There is a possibility, that due to the slicing procedure some inputs may be missed.

However, more recent studies provided evidence for non-linear computations during cortical processing (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lavzin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Smith et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Xu et al., 2012</a>). A potential explanation for this apparent contradiction (<a href=\"#bib9\">DeBello et al., 2014</a>) is that in the experiments described here, we stimulate a well-defined set of neurons, while inputs which are defined by the same sensory stimulus (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Jia et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Varga et al., 2011</a>) are in all likelihood arising from a mix of genetically/anatomically defined types of neurons. Input clustering has been shown for axodendritic contacts in the barn owl auditory system (<a href=\"#bib26\">McBride et al., 2008</a>), and more recently, in mice, for thalamocortical (<a href=\"#bib30\">Rah et al., 2013</a>) and hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses (<a href=\"#bib11\">Druckmann et al., 2014</a>). In all of these cases however there is no quantification of cluster parameters, which is crucial if one wants to relate the findings to any kind of biophysical model of dendritic computation. In this way our data and analysis go considerably beyond these reports by identifying individual clusters and quantifying cluster parameters, such as for example the number of inputs per cluster."

Superlinear integration can also occur without tight clustering (<a href=\"#bib5\">Branco et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</a>), but the specifics of the spatial input organization are expected to define how different temporal activity patterns determine the firing pattern of the postsynaptic cell.

L5 pyramidal cells with undetectable or low levels of ChR2-YFP expression in primary visual cortex were visually identified (2-photon imaging at 920 nm excitation) and patched in whole-cell voltage clamp mode (access resistance 10\u201330 M\u03a9; internal solution, in mM, 125 Cs-methanesulfonate, 10 HEPES, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>phosphocreatine, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 3 Na-L-ascorbate, 5 QX-314, 10 TEA-Cl, 1 Fluo-5F, 0.03 Alexa 594, pH 7.3). Cells were filled for \u226510 min at resting potential and then depolarized to 10 mV above the NMDAR reversal potential to remove the Mg<sup>2+</sup> block from NMDARs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Oertner et al., 2002</a>). Since in adulthood the occurrence of \u2018silent\u2019 synapses is effectively negligible (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rumpel et al., 1998</a>) NMDA receptor mediated calcium signals are expected to identify functional synapses containing both AMPA and NMDA receptors. The photostimulus (470 nm LED; Rapp OptoElectronic GmbH, Wedel, Germany) consisted of 3 pulses of 2 ms at 30\u2009Hz (4 mW at the objective back-aperture) and was applied via the fluorescence excitation path of the microscope to the full field of view. It evoked on average 1.57 \u00b1 0.54 (n\u00a0=\u00a012) action potentials selectively in 58% of the ChR2 expressing L5 neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig1s2\">2</a>). Dendritic branches were systematically scanned with overlapping rectangular tiles (5\u00d719.8 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>) at 810 nm excitation. Rotation of the tiles was adjusted to fit spines and parent dendritic segment optimally in the field of view. For calcium imaging, 50 frames (pixel size 100 x 100 nm<sup>2</sup>) of single z-planes were acquired at 10\u2009Hz in green (Fluo-5F) and red (Alexa 594) channel in the following sequence: First frame with laser shutter closed for measuring electrical offsets, 5 frames baseline before photostimulation, 2 frames with PMTs protected by a shutter during photostimulation, and 42 frames after the photostimulation. At every dendritic tile location, calcium imaging was repeated at least 3 times per z-plane (interstimulus interval, \u226510\u2009s) at multiple z-planes to cover every spine, and an image stack was taken at higher resolution (voxel size, 50 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 1000 nm<sup>3</sup>)."

Spine heads and their bases on the parent dendrite were marked with rectangular ROIs, and the dendritic segments were traced in reconstructions based on averaged red channel frames from calcium imaging or the maximum z-projections of the image stacks at each tile position stitched together based on cross-correlations. Spine calcium signals (\u25b3G/R) were calculated as change in fluorescence of the calcium indicator Fluo-5F (\u0394G) normalized to the mean intensity of the structural marker Alexa 594 (R) averaged over the brightest 70% of ROI pixels in the red channel. Dendrite calcium signals at the spine bases were calculated identically but without any pixel selection. \u0394G/R signals were smoothed (3-point moving average) and the peak amplitude in the 2nd\u00a0to\u00a04th time point after the stimulus as well as the standard deviations in the baseline interval and during the last five time points were determined. A spine was classified as receiving L5 input (L5 positive, L5+) if its peak \u0394G/R exceeded in one trial the dendritic peak \u0394G/R plus three times the higher value of the two standard deviations. We never observed large dendritic \u0394G/R signals at input clusters, which could lead to false negative spine categorization according to this classification, because spine/dendrite coupling is usually low (<a href=\"#bib32\">Sabatini et al., 2002</a>) and simultaneous activation of many spines within a cluster was very rare. The results of the classification algorithm for spine calcium signals were verified manually. Acquisitions with high noise in the calcium signal due to low fluorescence intensity, e.g. from small or out of focus spines, and without an evident difference between the spine and the dendrite calcium signal were classified as false-positives. Acquisitions with noticeable difference in spine and dendrite calcium signal, but classified by the algorithm as no response either due to a fast decaying spine calcium signal, or because spine and the dendrite calcium signal were of similar magnitude although the spine signal peak occurred earlier, were labeled as false-negatives. Acquisitions where a subjective decision was not possible were classified as ambiguous and treated as no response. In the individual traces (n\u00a0=\u00a015293 acquisitions), the total discrepancy between manual verification and the classification by the algorithm was 2.37%, which translated into a total discrepancy of 6.46% with respect to the input classification (0.55% false negatives, 4.2% false positives, 1.71% ambiguous; n\u00a0=\u00a02168 spines). CASIM might miss synapses with very low release probability but otherwise the false negative rate is mostly determined by the fraction of presynaptic neurons not expressing ChR2 as with other approaches relying on the expression of markers of any kind (e.g. <a href=\"#bib11\">Druckmann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Rah et al., 2013</a>). However, since undersampling the presynaptic population is expected to be random, this would not introduce artifacts of non-random structure in the mapped synapse distribution. Positions of spines on the dendrite were extracted from 3D reconstructions of dendrite traces in time-lapse acquisitions. The location of a spine was defined to be the point on the dendrite trace with the shortest orthogonal distance to the center of the spine head."

This probability is equivalent to the P value of the binomial test for the null hypothesis that the number of observed segments with an input cluster arises from a random input distribution (<a href=\"#bib43\">Yadav et al., 2012</a>). We find that the probability to observe c segments containing a cluster in the data set of 40 segments in total declines and remains below the significance threshold of 0.001 until the second last of the sorted segments (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>). The last segment with a cluster has a comparatively high OCL value (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>), which drives the probability to observe the given number of segments with a cluster above the significance threshold. However, the number of 11 segments with a cluster with a P value below 0.001 supports the hypothesis that L5+ spines are indeed arranged in clusters not by chance. This step serves further as confirmation for the appropriate choice of the cluster criterion in step 3."

This is an important and interesting topic, since synaptic input clustering has a large effect on the mode of input integration and plasticity in cortical pyramidal cells. Indeed, a number of papers have been published on this issue recently pro and contra (e.g. Kleindienst et al., Neuron, 2011; Takahashi et al., Science, 2012; Chen et al., 2011, Nature). Specifically, the authors investigated how spines in close proximity respond when a large population of ChR2+ layer 5 axons are activated simultaneously by developing a novel, optogenetics-based method. They conclude that L5-L5 synapses tend to cluster on the same dendritic branch (within a dendritic stretch of 20 um) in clusters containing 4 to 8 activated spines. The manuscript thus makes a valuable contribution to an ongoing debate in the field. However, several issues need to be addressed."

While statistically significant, these are rather small numbers and, thus, are insufficient to adequately quantify the real statistics of L5 clusters (i.e., are there really 4-8 activated spines on such a cluster?). As the authors argue \u2013 justifiably \u2013 that the main advantage of their method is to identify functional connections, the manuscript would be strengthened by improving the statistics, with more convincing quantification of the cluster size."

Are they more effective in evoking supralinear responses opposed to randomly activated spines? Indeed, the authors suggest (based on other studies) that, in L5-L5 clusters, there would be non-linear dendritic integration of synaptic inputs during synchronous activation. But they do activate L5 synchronously with optogenetics, so they should observe this nonlinearity (e.g. local NMDA spikes \u2013 in the experiment suggested below \u2013 and/or large Ca signals in both the corresponding dendritic spines and dendritic shaft, belonging to the cluster \u2013 as opposed to cases where L5 synapses are not clustered). The authors seem to be in an ideal position to examine whether their morphological clusters are indeed operating in the supra-linear regime.

Are they more effective in evoking supralinear responses opposed to randomly activated spines? Indeed, the authors suggest (based on other studies) that, in L5-L5 clusters, there would be non-linear dendritic integration of synaptic inputs during synchronous activation. But they do activate L5 synchronously with optogenetics, so they should observe this nonlinearity (e.g. local NMDA spikes \u2013 in the experiment suggested below \u2013 and/or large Ca signals in both the corresponding dendritic spines and dendritic shaft, belonging to the cluster \u2013 as opposed to cases where L5 synapses are not clustered). The authors seem to be in an ideal position to examine whether their morphological clusters are indeed operating in the supra-linear regime.
