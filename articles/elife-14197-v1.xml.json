However, the signaling mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of GABAergic modulation are not completely understood. Here, we demonstrate that a GABAergic signal in <i>C. elegans</i> modulates the amplitude of undulatory head bending through extrasynaptic neurotransmission and conserved metabotropic receptors. We show that the GABAergic RME head motor neurons generate undulatory activity patterns that correlate with head bending and the activity of RME causally links with head bending amplitude. The undulatory activity of RME is regulated by a pair of cholinergic head motor neurons SMD, which facilitate head bending, and inhibits SMD to limit head bending. The extrasynaptic neurotransmission between SMD and RME provides a gain control system to set head bending amplitude to a value correlated with optimal efficiency of forward movement."

However, the signaling mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of GABAergic modulation are not completely understood. Here, we demonstrate that a GABAergic signal in <i>C. elegans</i> modulates the amplitude of undulatory head bending through extrasynaptic neurotransmission and conserved metabotropic receptors. We show that the GABAergic RME head motor neurons generate undulatory activity patterns that correlate with head bending and the activity of RME causally links with head bending amplitude. The undulatory activity of RME is regulated by a pair of cholinergic head motor neurons SMD, which facilitate head bending, and inhibits SMD to limit head bending. The extrasynaptic neurotransmission between SMD and RME provides a gain control system to set head bending amplitude to a value correlated with optimal efficiency of forward movement."

Neuromodulation of circuit activity is widespread in the neural circuits that generate structured locomotory patterns, such as walking, running, swimming, as well as feeding. Among a large number of neuromodulators, GABA, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter found in all nervous systems, plays a critical role in modulating locomotory patterns by regulating the underlying neural circuits at multiple levels (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tegner et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cazalets et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Reith and Sillar, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Swensen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ziskind-Conhaim, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Fidelin et al., 2015</a>)."

In the crab <i>Cancer borealis</i>, GABA is identified in a few neuromodulatory neurons that project to the stomatogastric nervous system, which generates a pyloric rhythmic pattern. All the stomatogastric neurons respond to GABA with either an excitatory or inhibitory effect (<a href=\"#bib65\">Swensen et al., 2000</a>), which are likely to contribute to the diverse motor patterns that can be generated by the stomatogastric system. The modulatory role of GABA has also been characterized in the spinal motor networks, where reciprocal glycinergic inhibition between contralateral and antagonist neuronal pools gives rise to rhythmic motor activities in different vertebrate animals (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alford and Williams, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Brown, 1914</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Buchanan, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Cohen and Harris-Warrick, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dale, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Friesen, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sharp et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Soffe, 1987</a>). For example, in isolated lamprey spinal cord electrophysiological and pharmacological data showed that an internally released GABA signal regulated spinal burst rate and modulated intersegmental coordination (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tegner et al., 1993</a>). In <i>Xenopus laevis</i> tadpoles, pharmacologically manipulating the activity of spinal GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor(s) alters the duration and rate of swimming episodes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Reith and Sillar, 1999</a>). In zebrafish larva, the activity of a set of GABA-producing sensory neurons in the spinal cord inhibits the slow fictive swimming events during either resting or active state (<a href=\"#bib29\">Fidelin et al., 2015</a>). In the in vitro spinal cord preparation isolated from neonatal rats, GABA modulates the locomotory patterns (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cazalets et al., 1998</a>) and in the neonatal mouse spinal cord, GABAergic transmission is shown to play an integrated role in generating motor activity patterns (<a href=\"#bib74\">Ziskind-Conhaim, 2013</a>)."

For example, GABAergic neurons are often widely distributed in nervous systems to regulate diverse neuronal types. GABAergic neurotransmission can act either synaptically through the ionic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors or extrasynaptically through metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (<a href=\"#bib23\">Dittman and Regehr, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Isaacson et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sigel and Steinmann, 2012</a>). Therefore, the high level of heterogeneity in the properties of GABA signals precludes a complete understanding of how GABA modulates the operation of a given neural circuit. In addition, while a large body of electrophysiological and pharmacological evidence revealed the compelling role of GABAergic modulation in motor activities, the causal link between the modulatory activity of GABA and the behavioral consequence in locomotion has not been established in behaving animals."

The nervous system of the nematode is easily accessed by genetic tools, making it feasible to monitor and manipulate the activity of specific neurons in behaving animals in order to address the causal role of neural activity in movements. In addition, the small and fully sequenced genome encodes homologues of many known molecules that function in the mammalian brains, allowing characterization of these conserved factors in a genetically tractable organism (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bargmann, 1998</a>)."

The undulatory locomotory wave travels posteriorly from head to tail through contraction of body muscles (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wen et al., 2012</a>). In an adult hermaphrodite, two major motor networks mediate forward movement, the head motor circuit and the ventral nerve cord motor circuit that innervate 95 muscle cells arranged in parallel rows along its dorsal and ventral sides (<a href=\"#bib3\">Altun and Hall, 2009</a>). The head motor circuit that innervates the anterior muscle cells in the head and neck consists of several groups of excitatory cholinergic motor neurons, including four SMD (sublateral motor neurons class D) neurons, and one group of inhibitory GABAergic motor neurons, the four RME (ring motor neuron class E) neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib3\">Altun and Hall, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Gray et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">White et al., 1986</a>). The ventral nerve cord motor circuit that innervates the rest of the body wall muscles consists of excitatory cholinergic A-type and B-type motor neurons, which are required for backward and forward movement, respectively, as well as D-type GABAergic inhibitory motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chalfie et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">White et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">1986</a>). All ventral nerve cord motor neurons are subdivided into dorsal and ventral groups that innervate dorsal and ventral muscles, respectively; and both A- and B-type cholinergic neurons activate D-type GABAergic neurons that innervate the antagonistic muscles on the opposing side. This network connectivity allows alternating contraction and relaxation of the dorsal and ventral muscles that propagates the undulatory body wave from the head region to the rest of the body during forward movements (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chalfie et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">White et al., 1976</a>, <a href=\"#bib72\">1986</a>)."

In this study, we characterize the mechanism whereby GABA modulates the amplitude of head bending during forward movement. We show that the GABAergic head motor neurons RME and the cholinergic motor neurons SMD functionally interact through extrasynaptic neurotransmission and conserved metabotropic receptors. The inhibitory feedback between RME and SMD provides a gain control mechanism to regulate the extent of head bending. The activity of RME plays a causal role in setting the amplitude of head bending to a value that correlates with optimal speed and propulsion efficiency of forward movement."

The undulatory body waves travel posteriorly from the head region (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wen et al., 2012</a>). The anterior groups of muscle cells in the head and neck are innervated by several groups of cholinergic excitatory motor neurons, including four SMD neurons with two SMDD neurons innervating dorsal muscles and two SMDV neurons innervating ventral muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Altun and Hall, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Gray et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">McIntire et al., 1993b</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">White et al., 1986</a>). Similar groups of anterior muscle cells are also innervated by four GABAergic RME motor neurons, RMED (Dorsal), RMEV (Ventral), RMEL (Left), and RMER (Right) that innervate the contralateral muscles in the ventral, dorsal, right, and left quadrants, respectively (note that different from excitatory motor neurons, RMED innervates <i>ventral</i> muscles and RMEV innervate <i>dorsal</i> muscles) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib48\">McIntire et al., 1993b</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">White et al., 1986</a>). To characterize the role of GABAergic neurotransmission in undulatory head bending, we focused on the RME GABAergic neurons. We first killed the four RME neurons with a laser beam with the aid of a fluorescent reporter transgene that was expressed in RME and other GABAergic neurons. We found that the operated animals still made undulatory head bending and forward movement, suggesting that the RME GABAergic neurons are not required for the generation of the movements. However, killing RME increased the amplitude of the undulatory head bending during forward movement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and C</a>). This result, consistent with an earlier study (<a href=\"#bib48\">McIntire et al., 1993b</a>), shows that the RME GABAergic neurons modulate the amplitude of the undulatory head bending."

                                "text": "To test specific roles among RME neurons, we ablated the RMED/V and RMEL/R subsets separately. We found that killing the RMED/V pair increased head bending amplitude along the dorsal-ventral axis to the same extent as ablating all four RME neurons, whereas killing RMEL/R did not generate any obvious defect (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). Thus, RMED/V neurons negatively regulate head bending amplitude. Henceforth, RME refers to the RMED/V neurons in this study. Since the RME neurons are GABAergic, we tested the effect of removing components of GABA signaling pathway, including UNC-25, the GABA biosynthetic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and UNC-47, a vesicular transporter of GABA (<a href=\"#bib26\">Eastman et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jin et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">McIntire et al., 1993a</a>).

We used a microfluidic device in which an animal was able to bend its head in the dorsal-ventral direction (<a href=\"#bib19\">Chronis et al., 2007</a>). Each RME neuron extends one process posteriorly and two contralaterally, and the contralaterally extending processes innervate head muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,E and F</a>). We measured the calcium transients in the somata of RME neurons, since their somata and their muscle-innervating processes displayed correlated calcium signals under the experimental conditions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We found that RME generated undulatory calcium signals during head bending: RMED displayed increased intracellular calcium transients during dorsal head bending and RMEV displayed increased intracellular calcium transients during ventral head bending (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). We defined ventral head bending as positive and dorsal head bending as negative. Using cross-correlation analysis, we found that RMEV calcium activity positively correlated with head bending and RMED calcium activity negatively correlated with head bending (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). The calcium signals in RMEV and RMED were anti-correlated during head bending. The oscillatory activity pattern allows RME to regulate head bending with a temporal pattern that matches that of head undulation."

                                "text": "To identify the cholinergic neurons that drive the undulatory calcium activity in RME, we examined the motor neurons SMD, because we previously showed that similar to RME the cholinergic SMDD and SMDV motor neurons that innervated the same sets of head and neck muscles also displayed calcium activity that was correlated with dorsal-ventral head bending (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hendricks et al., 2012</a>). We first generated transgenic animals that allowed us to simultaneously monitor calcium activities in SMD and RME with the calcium sensitive fluorescent reporter GCaMP3. We found that SMDV and RMEV generated increased calcium transients during ventral head bending, while SMDD and RMED generated increased calcium transients during dorsal head bending (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). The calcium activity of SMD correlated with that of RME during head bending and led that of RME (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). These results support the possibility that the cholinergic transmission of SMD regulates RME activity. Next, to address this hypothesis, we expressed the <i>cha-1</i> cDNA under the <i>glr-1</i> or the <i>lad-2</i> promoter in the <i>cha-1(p1152)</i> mutant animals and found that either <i>Pglr-1::cha-1</i> or <i>Plad-2::cha-1</i> fully rescued the RME calcium dynamics that was correlated with dorsal-ventral head bending (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D and E</a>). Both the <i>glr-1</i> and <i>lad-2</i> promoters drive expression in multiple cells, but the only cholinergic head motor neurons that consistently\u00a0express both of the promoters are SMD (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brockie et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hendricks et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wang et al., 2008</a>). To strengthen the specificity of our results, we ablated SMD neurons in the transgenic animals that expressed <i>Pglr-1::cha-1</i> in the <i>cha-1(p1152)</i> mutant animals. We found that the rescuing effect on the RME calcium activity was completely lost in the ablated animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F and G</a>). Together, these results support the instructive role of SMD in generating the oscillatory calcium activity of RME."

                                "text": "Intriguingly, SMD neurons do not synapse onto RME (<a href=\"#bib72\">White et al., 1986</a>), suggesting that extrasynaptic neurotransmission from SMD regulates RME. To characterize the potential involvement of extrasynaptic cholinergic neurotransmission, we sought the cholinergic receptor that mediated the neurotransmission from SMD to RME. Extrasynaptic neurotransmission is regulated by G-protein coupled receptors, because the high binding affinity of these receptors allows intercellular signaling over a relatively long distance (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hille, 1992</a>). <i>C. elegans</i> has three G-protein coupled acetylcholine receptors that are encoded by <i>gar-1, gar-2</i> and <i>gar-3</i> and are similar to the mammalian muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hwang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lee et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Park et al., 2000</a>). Previously, it was shown that <i>gar-2</i> was widely expressed in the nervous system, including in the GABAergic motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dittman and Kaplan, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lee et al., 2000</a>). Interestingly, we found that the head bending-correlated activity of RME was significantly reduced in the deletion mutant <i>gar-2(ok520)</i> and the defect was fully rescued by expressing a wild-type <i>gar-2</i>\u00a0DNA fragment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). This result indicates that GAR-2 mediates the SMD cholinergic signal to generate the undulatory activity pattern of RME. The reduced activity of the RME neurons in the <i>gar-2(ok520)</i> mutants also predicts that the <i>gar-2(ok520)</i> animals should exhibit increased head bending amplitude. Indeed, we found that <i>gar-2(ok520)</i> displayed significantly larger amplitude of head bending (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>), similar to the effect of removing RMED and RMEV with laser ablation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Expressing a wild-type <i>gar-2</i> cDNA (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dittman and Kaplan, 2008</a>) with either the endogenous <i>gar-2</i> promoter or the <i>unc-25</i> promoter that was selective for the GABAergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jin et al., 1999</a>) fully rescued the defect of the <i>gar-2(ok520)</i> mutants in head bending amplitude (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Among all GABAergic neurons only RME innervate head muscles and regulate head bending (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib48\">McIntire et al., 1993b</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">White et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">1986</a>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the extrasynaptic cholinergic neurotransmission of SMD facilitates the oscillatory activity of RME via the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor GAR-2 to regulate the amplitude of head bending. To exclude the possibility that indirect synaptic neurotransmission underlies the modulatory effect of the SMD cholinergic signal on RME, we further examined the synaptic wiring (<a href=\"#bib72\">White et al., 1986</a>). We showed that ablating SMD completely removed the rescuing effect of <i>Pglr-1::cha-1</i> on the undulatory activity of RME in the <i>cha-1(p1152)</i> mutant animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F and G</a>). We found that among all the neurons that consistently express the <i>glr-1</i> promoter, only the cholinergic head neurons RMDD and RMDV are postsynaptic of SMD or connect with SMD via gap junction. However, neither RMDD nor RMDV neurons synapse onto RME. Overall, our results in combination with the connectome reveal that the head-bending correlated activity of RME is generated by extrasynaptic cholinergic neurotransmission that originates from the head motor neurons SMD."

We found that either mutation disrupted the head bending-correlated calcium dynamics in RME (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D and E</a>). However, blocking neurotransmission by expressing TeTx in two sets of major presynaptic neurons of RME, the cholinergic motor neurons SMB (<i>Podr-2(18)::TeTx</i>) or sensory neurons IL2 (<i>Pklp-6::TeTx</i>), or both SMB and IL2 had no effect on RME calcium activity (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that general reduction in cholinergic neurotransmission is not sufficient to disrupt RME calcium dynamics. To address the question more specifically, we also performed laser ablation of SMD. We found that ablating SMD disrupted head bending-correlated calcium activities in RME while the RME neurons in the SMD-ablated animals remained active (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F and G</a>). In contrast, ablating the IL2 sensory neurons had no effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F and G</a>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the cholinergic excitatory motor neurons SMD drive the head bending-correlated oscillatory activity in RME through an extrasynaptic signal. RME generates a modulatory signal that limits head bending amplitude. The oscillatory activity of RME provides a mechanism through which the GABAergic modulatory signal mediates head bending with a temporal pattern that matches that of head undulation."

We focused on the metabotropic GABA receptors, due to the modulatory role of RME on head bending (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The <i>C. elegans</i> genome encodes the homologs of the subunits of the mammalian metabotropic B-type GABAergic receptors GABA<sub>B</sub>R1 and GABA<sub>B</sub>R2, which are GBB-1 and GBB-2, respectively. Similar to their mammalian homologs GBB-1 and GBB-2 act as obligate heterodimers (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dittman and Kaplan, 2008</a>). We first tested a deletion mutant <i>gbb-1(tm1406).</i> We found that similar to removing the GABA biosynthetic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase in the <i>unc-25(e156)</i> null mutant animals, the deletion mutation in <i>gbb-1(tm1406)</i> increased the amplitude of head bending during forward movement (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In addition, the double mutant <i>gbb-1(tm1406);gbb-2(tm1165)</i> similarly increased head bending amplitude (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with the notion that GBB-1 and GBB-2 function as heterodimers (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dittman and Kaplan, 2008</a>). The exaggerated head bending in the <i>gbb-1(tm1406)</i> mutant animals was rescued by expressing a wild-type <i>gbb-1</i> cDNA under the <i>gbb-1</i> endogenous promoter (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Previously, it was shown that a GFP reporter driven by the <i>gbb-1</i> promoter was expressed in the cholinergic neurons along the ventral nerve cord, but not in the GABAergic neurons or muscles (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dittman and Kaplan, 2008</a>). We found that the transcriptional reporter of <i>gbb-1</i> was also expressed in a number of head neurons, including SMD (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013H</a>). Importantly, expressing the wild-type <i>gbb-1</i> cDNA with the <i>glr-1</i> or <i>lad-2</i> promoter restored normal head bending in the <i>gbb-1(tm1406)</i> mutant animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I and J</a>). Among the head motor neurons, the expression of <i>Pglr-1::gbb-1</i> and <i>Plad-2::gbb-1</i> consistently overlaps in the SMD neurons (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brockie et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hendricks et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wang et al., 2008</a>). Together, these results indicate that the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor acts in SMD to limit the amplitude of head bending and suggest that RME restrict head bending by negatively regulating SMD. This conclusion predicts that inhibiting SMD should generate smaller head bending. Consistently, we found that ablating SMD neurons significantly reduced the amplitude of head bending, indicating that SMD promote the amplitude of head bending (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). Together, these results indicate that the RME GABAergic neurotransmission limits the amplitude of head bending by inhibiting SMD, which positively regulate head undulation. Interestingly, there is only one synapse identified from RMED and RMEV to the four SMD neurons [RMEV\u2192SMDD<span class=\"underline\">R</span>(Right)] (<a href=\"#bib72\">White et al., 1986</a>). Therefore, it is conceivable that the RME GABAergic neurons regulate SMD through extrasynaptic neurotransmission via the G-protein coupled GABAergic receptor GBB-1/GBB-2."

We acutely manipulated the activity of RME in moving animals by inhibiting or activating it with optogenetics and measured the resulting behavioral effects. We first tested the effect of inhibiting RME using transgenic animals that expressed the light-sensitive proton pump archaerhodopsin (Arch) in all GABAergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Chow et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Okazaki et al., 2012</a>). Using an illumination system, CoLBeRT, that tracked the position of a moving animal and illuminated selected regions on the worm body [Materials and methods and (<a href=\"#bib44\">Leifer et al., 2011</a>)], we followed movement of freely-moving animals and selectively illuminated RME neurons with a green laser. We found that during forward movement optogenetic inhibition of RME caused exaggerated head deflection, mimicking the effect of RME ablation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). The head bending amplitude returned to normal upon the removal of green light (<a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). Next, we examined the effect of RME activation in transgenic animals expressing the light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin (ChR2) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boyden et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Liu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nagel et al., 2003</a>) in all the GABAergic neurons. In these experiments, we ablated a GABAergic interneuron RIS, because the process of RIS was adjacent to the soma of RME and optogenetic activation of RIS was shown to induce sleep-like quiescence (<a href=\"#bib68\">Turek et al., 2013</a>), potentially interfering with the behavioral effects of activating RME. Ablating RIS by itself does not have a significant impact on the amplitude of head bending (<a href=\"#bib48\">McIntire et al., 1993b</a>). We found that optogenetic activation of RME, which was achieved by selective illumination of blue light with the CoLBeRT system [Materials and methods (<a href=\"#bib44\">Leifer et al., 2011</a>)], caused a significant reduction in the amplitude of head bending, mimicking the effect of SMD ablation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a> and <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). Head bending amplitude returned to normal after removal of the blue light (<a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). These results together indicate that inhibiting or activating RME in moving animals causally lead to increased or decreased head bending amplitude, respectively."

First, we found that optogenetic stimulation of RME in <i>unc-25(e156)</i> mutants did not change head bending amplitude, indicating that the behavioral effect of activating RME depends on GABA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Second, activating RME in <i>unc-49(e407)</i>, a loss-of-function mutant of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor that is expressed primarily in muscles (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bamber et al., 1999</a>), still reduced head bending amplitude similarly as in wild type (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), suggesting that the UNC-49 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor is not critical for RME to limit the amplitude of head bending. In comparison, activating RME in the <i>gbb-1(tm1406)</i> mutant animals significantly reduced the effect of activating RME on head bending amplitude (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and activating RME in the <i>unc-49(e407);gbb-1(tm1406)</i> double mutant animals completely abolished the effect of RME activation on head bending amplitude (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Furthermore, expressing a wild-type <i>gbb-1</i> cDNA with either the <i>glr-1</i> or <i>lad-2</i> promoter rescued the effects of activating RME on head bending amplitude in the <i>unc-49(e407);gbb-1(tm1406)</i> mutant animals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Expression of the <i>glr-1</i> and <i>lad-2</i> promoters consistently overlaps in the SMD neurons (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brockie et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hendricks et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wang et al., 2008</a>). These results show that the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor GBB-1/GBB-2 plays a critical role in mediating the modulatory effect of RME neurons on head bending amplitude and reveal a potential implication of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor in head bending regulation through an unknown mechanism. Taken together, these results demonstrate that RME neurons negatively regulate the amplitude of head bending through the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor GBB-1/GBB-2 in SMD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

We then asked what role the amplitude of head bending played in forward locomotion. To address this question, we analyzed the relationship between head bending amplitude and the speed and efficiency of forward movement. In the case of slender organisms undulating in Newtonian fluids, the classical resistance force theory (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gray and Hancock, 1955</a>) predicts quantitatively that the propulsion efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of the actual speed (<i>V<sub>a</sub></i>) to the wave speed of body undulation (<i>V<sub>w</sub></i>) in the reference frame of a worm, grows with the angle of attack (\u03b8<sub>a</sub>), which is defined as the mean angle of a body segment with respect to the direction of forward movement (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fang-Yen et al., 2010</a>). In the small angle limit, the relationship is given by the red curve and the equation in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gray and Hancock, 1955</a>). Using wild-type animals we measured both variables during bouts of (~10\u201315 s) forward locomotion (The data points in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), and found that experimental data closely fit the theoretical curve (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We measured the amplitude of head bending and found that angle of attack was also positively correlated with the amplitude of head bending (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Therefore, increasing head bending correlates with greater locomotion efficiency and faster actual speed of movement (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). However, when the head bending amplitude continued to increase, the wave speed of body undulation decreased (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), possibly due to limiting biomechanical factors, such as speed of muscle contraction. As a result, within the physiological range of head bending amplitude, the speed of forward movement approached its maximum when the angle of attack was at around 45 degree (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). These findings suggest that an optimal range of head bending amplitude might correlate with efficient forward movement. Consistently, we found that either optogenetically inhibiting or activating RME, which caused increased or decreased head bending amplitude (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), significantly reduced the actual speed of locomotion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) and the propulsion efficiency (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together, our results reveal that the RME GABAergic modulatory neurotransmission plays an important role in setting the amplitude of head bending near the optimal value for forward movement."

Neuromodulation, mediated by a large number of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, plays a critical role in this regulation. Here, we characterized a modulatory role of the GABAergic motor neurons RME in regulating the undulatory head bending during forward movement. We identified the extrasynaptic mechanism through which RME inhibited the cholinergic excitatory motor neurons SMD via the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor GBB-1/GBB-2 to limit the amplitude of head bending. Interestingly, we also found that the activity of RME depended on the excitatory cholinergic inputs from SMD that also innervated the anterior muscles, providing a circuit mechanism whereby the activity of the GABAergic RME neurons temporally matches the activity of SMD and head bending undulation. We demonstrated that activating or inhibiting the activity of RME led to decreased or increased head bending amplitude during undulatory movement, causally linking the modulatory role of RME GABAergic signal with the amplitude of head undulation in moving animals."

Killing RME does not eliminate the undulatory forward movement, indicating that RME are not required to generate forward movement and revealing a modulatory role of the RME GABAergic neurotransmission in mediating the pattern of forward locomotion. It has been shown that GABA modulates locomotory circuits either extrinsically or intrinsically as part of the motor circuit (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cazalets et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Reith and Sillar, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tegner et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ziskind-Conhaim, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Fidelin et al, 2015</a>). Here, we characterized a signaling mechanism whereby the RME GABAergic neurotransmission modulated the pattern of head undulation during forward movements. We also demonstrated the causal role of the RME GABAergic neurotransmission in setting the amplitude of head bending in moving animals and showed that an optimal range of head bending amplitude correlated with the speed and efficiency of forward movement. We propose that the inhibitory feedback between SMD and RME provides a gain control mechanism to dynamically regulate head bending. When SMD activity is high and the head bending amplitude is large, RME inhibition is strong; when SMD activity is low and the head bending amplitude is small, RME inhibition is weak. This regulatory mechanism together with the phase-lock of RME activity to the head bending allows RME to continuously adjust its strength of inhibition based on the strength of SMD activity to set the head bending amplitude within an optimal range. Gain control mechanisms are commonly observed in motor systems (<a href=\"#bib38\">Johnson and Heckman, 2014</a>). Here, we characterize the extrasynaptic neurotransmission of GABA, a common transmitter, that regulates a motor gain control through a conserved metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor."

Pharmacologically manipulating the activity of GABA<sub>A</sub> versus GABA<sub>B</sub> often generates different effects on locomotory circuits (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cazalets et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Reith and Sillar, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Swensen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tegner et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Ziskind-Conhaim, 2013</a>). While GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors act as chloride channels; metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors signal through G-protein pathways (<a href=\"#bib54\">Olsen, 1991</a>). Here, we characterize the extrasynaptic GABAergic neurotransmission through which the <i>C. elegans</i> GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor modulates locomotion. <i>C. elegans</i> has two subunits of GABA<sub>B</sub> that are encoded by <i>gbb-1</i> and <i>gbb-2</i> and act as heterodimers (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dittman and Kaplan, 2008</a>). We showed that the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor subunit GBB-1 mediated the causal behavioral effect of the RME GABAergic neurotransmission on head bending undulation. In contrast, we found that mutating <i>unc-49,</i> which encoded a <i>C. elegans</i> homolog of GABA<sub>A</sub> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bamber et al., 1999</a>), in the wild-type background did not significantly reduce the effect of activating RME with ChR2 on the amplitude of head bending (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). It was previously shown that the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor UNC-49 was expressed in the body wall muscles (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bamber et al., 1999</a>) and mutating <i>unc-49</i> eliminated GABA-induced hyperpolarization in the body muscles (<a href=\"#bib60\">Richmond and Jorgensen, 1999</a>), resulting in a 'shrinker' phenotype that phenocopied the locomotory defect of killing D-type GABAergic ventral nerve cord motor neurons, but not the defect of killing RME (<a href=\"#bib47\">McIntire et al., 1993a</a>). Together, these findings indicate that both the identity of the GABAergic neurons and the target cells that express either GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors contribute to the behavioral effects of GABAergic neurotransmission. We speculate that the slow kinetics of the metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor and the downstream signaling match the temporal dynamics of head undulation, which operates at around 1\u00a0Hz (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wen et al., 2012</a>)."

The protein sequence of GAR-2 is similar to the mammalian M2/M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which are coupled with G<sub>i/o,</sub> and the mammalian M1/M3/M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which are coupled with G<sub>q</sub> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lanzafame et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lee et al., 2000</a>).

Here, we showed that GAR-2 mediated the undulatory activity of RME in response to the cholinergic neurotransmission of SMD. We speculate that GAR-2 might be coupled with an excitatory G<sub>\u03b1</sub> subunit or\u00a0might inhibit an inhibitory signaling pathway, resulting in the activation of RME. Alternatively, GAR-2 may regulate the head-bending correlated temporal dynamics of RME activity and loss of GAR-2 would result in the reduced correlation of RME activity and head undulation, altering the modulatory effect of RME on head bending."

While our study addresses the modulatory role of RME in regulating the amplitude of head undulation and how changing head bending amplitude correlates with propulsion efficiency, it does not exclude other mechanisms whereby GABA regulates locomotory patterns. For example, it was previously shown that the D-type GABAergic ventral nerve cord motor neurons directly synapsed onto the cholinergic ventral nerve cord motor neurons and inhibited these excitatory motor neurons through the GBB-1/GBB-2 receptor to mediate the speed of forward movement (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dittman and Kaplan, 2008</a>).

Here, we showed that it was the GABAergic neurotransmission from RMED and RMEV, but not RMEL or RMER, that modulated head undulation. What accounts for the functional difference between the dorsal-ventral pair and the left-right pair of RME neurons? Previous studies in the stomatogastric nervous system suggested that difference in the diffusion patterns of the neuropeptide proctolin that was released from different modulatory neurons contributed to different modulatory effects of proctolin (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wood et al., 2002</a>). There is only one synapse between RMED/V neurons and four SMD motor neurons, two SMDD (dorsal) and two SMDV (ventral), consistent with the involvement of extrasynaptic neurotransmission. The somata of RMED and RMEV are located next to the somata of SMDD and SMDV on the dorsal and ventral sides; while the somata of RMEL and REMR are mainly on the lateral sides, away from SMD (<a href=\"#bib72\">White et al., 1986</a>). Thus, it is conceivable that the anatomical features of these motor neurons allow the GABA signal released from RMED/V to regulate SMD more efficiently than the GABA released from RMEL/R, highlighting the importance of the spatial property of neuromodulators in their modulatory effects on neural circuits and behavior. It is also possible that GABA in RMED/V versus RMEL/R is co-released with different neurotransmitters or peptides, a mechanism which also partially accounts for different modulatory effects of proctolin released from different modulatory neurons in the stomatogastric nervous system (<a href=\"#bib52\">Nusbaum et al., 2001</a>). A complete profile of the neurotransmitters and peptides expressed in the four RME neurons is not available yet; therefore, the potential difference in the co-release of neurotransmitters from different RME neurons remains to be further investigated."

All nervous systems express a large number of neuromodulators that can substantially regulate the functional organization of neural circuits. Our study points to the importance of functional studies in combination with wiring diagrams in order to better understand how the nervous systems operate."

LR recombination reactions were performed using Gateway LR Clonase enzyme kits according to the protocol provided (Invitrogen), generating the expression clones <i>Podr-2(18)::cha-1::mCherry, Pklp-6::cha-1::mCherry, Pglr-1::cha-1::mCherry, Plad-2::cha-1::mCherry, Podr-2(18)::TeTx::mCherry, Pklp-6::TeTx::mCherry, Pklp-6::gfp, Podr-2(18)::gfp, Pglr-1::mCherry, Pgbb-1::gbb-1, Pglr-1::gbb-1</i>, and <i>Plad-2::gbb-1</i>. To generate transgenic lines, <i>Pgbb-1::gbb-1</i> was injected at 1 ng/\u03bcl. <i>Pglr-1::gbb-1</i> and <i>Plad-2::gbb-1</i> were injected at 10 ng/\u03bcl and the other plasmids were injected at 25 ng/\u03bcl. Microinjection was performed as described (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mello et al., 1991</a>) with either <i>Punc-122::gfp</i> or <i>Punc-122::dsRed</i> as a co-injection marker for all the transgenic lines."

A SU-8 master was used to cast Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Dow Corning Sylgard 184, Ellsworth Adhesives, Germantown, WI) chips and inlet holes were drilled manually. Chips were bonded to glass coverslips with a handheld corona treater and connected to a perfusion system (Automate Scientific Valvebank, Berkeley, CA). Fluorescence time-lapse imaging (100\u2013200\u00a0ms exposure, 5\u00a0Hz) was performed on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U inverted microscope with a 40\u00d7 oil immersion objective and a Photometrics CoolSnap EZ camera. To image neurons on different focal planes, an image stack was collected on a confocal spinning disk microscope. Animals were washed by NGM buffer (1\u00a0mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1\u00a0mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 25\u00a0mM KPO<sub>4</sub> pH6.0) briefly before being loaded in the worm channel, and were presented with slow streams of NGM buffer throughout the recording of up to 5 min. All image analysis was performed with ImageJ (NIH) unless otherwise specified. Frames were aligned using the StackReg plugin where necessary. For RME imaging, total fluorescence intensity was measured by subtracting background from the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to the cell body of RMED or RMEV neuron during head bending. For cross-correlation analysis, the fluorescence intensity data were normalized for each individual to a linear scale by the formula (<i>F - F</i><sub>min</sub>)/(<i>F</i><sub>max</sub> - <i>F</i><sub>min</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hendricks et al., 2012</a>). For simultaneous imaging of SMD and RME, image stacks were composed and processed by a customized program (uploaded to <a href=\"https://github.com/Wenlab/worm-imaging-analysis\">https://github.com/Wenlab/worm-imaging-analysis</a>) written in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick).

The study demonstrates that SMD uses cholinergic signaling to activate RME which in turn inhibits SMD through primarily GABAB receptor-dependent signaling. Further the role of either increasing or decreasing activity in these cells, including the consequences of ablating neurons or disrupting chemical messenger pathways is nicely demonstrated in behaving animals using optogenetic techniques. Most conclusions of the study are very well supported by the data. The use of every imaginable advantage of the worm system to manipulate and assess neuronal circuit activity and behavior, all in live animals, is clearly the major strength of this paper. The paper is yet another demonstration of the limits of connectomics since extrasynaptic signals such as those described here follow no anatomical rules."

Why is the GABAergic modulation time-locked to the head bending; would a tonic inhibitory modulatory tone have different consequences?\"</i>We appreciate the suggestion. We show that SMD facilitate head bending as well as activate RME, and RME subsequently inhibit SMD to limit head bending. We propose that this convoluted way of regulating head bending provides a gain control mechanism. When SMD activity is high and the head bending amplitude is large, RME inhibition is strong; when SMD activity is low and the head bending amplitude is small, RME inhibition is weak. This regulatory mechanism together with the phase-lock of RME activity to the head bending allows RME to dynamically adjust its strength of inhibition based on the strength of SMD activity to set the head bending amplitude within an optimal range. Gain control mechanisms are commonly observed in motor systems. In this paper, we have identified the role of a conserved B-type GABAergic receptor in mediating motor gain control. We propose that the circuit organization and the regulatory mechanisms revealed in our study would be of a general appeal. We have included the discussion in the second paragraph of the Discussion section."

In Newtonian fluid, the propulsion efficiency as a function of angle of attack can be derived from resistive force theory; this theoretical description fits well with our measurement on head bending and propulsion efficiency (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and 7B</a>). Therefore, the amplitude of head bending strongly correlates with speed and propulsion efficiency, although we agree that we do not yet understand the mechanism underlying the correlation.
