Protein disaggregation involves polypeptide extraction from aggregates and its translocation through the central channel of the Hsp104 hexamer. This process relies on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. Considering that Hsp104 is characterized by low affinity towards ATP and is strongly inhibited by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), we asked how Hsp104 functions at the physiological levels of adenine nucleotides. We demonstrate that physiological levels of ADP highly limit Hsp104 activity. This inhibition, however, is moderated by the Hsp70 chaperone, which allows efficient disaggregation by supporting Hsp104 binding to aggregates but not to non-aggregated, disordered protein substrates. Our results point to an additional level of Hsp104 regulation by Hsp70, which restricts the potentially toxic protein unfolding activity of Hsp104 to the disaggregation process, providing the yeast protein-recovery system with substrate specificity and efficiency in ATP consumption."

Recent measurements in intact yeast cells show that ATP concentration oscillates around 2.6\u2009mM (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ozalp et al., 2010</a>), which is an intermediate value of the previously reported ATP levels measured\u00a0in cell extracts (2.1\u20133.4\u2009mM) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Canelas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Teusink et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wu et al., 2006</a>). This ATP concentration will be referred to as physiological thorough this work, although it needs to be kept in mind that the cellular level of ATP changes when yeast metabolism adapts to the\u00a0growth conditions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Larsson et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Osorio et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ozalp et al., 2010</a>). We measured the ATPase activity of Hsp104 at fixed 2.6\u2009mM ATP and increasing ADP concentrations. At the physiological ATP level the rate of ATP hydrolysis was reduced to only 20 molecules of ATP hydrolyzed per minute per Hsp104 monomer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) as compared to 90 ATP molecules at the\u00a0saturating ATP concentration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). ADP in the reaction mixtures caused strong inhibition of the ATPase activity, which dropped to less than 2 ATP molecules per minute at 1\u2009mM ADP. This level of ADP represents the\u00a0average of the ADP concentrations in yeast cells established in the\u00a0previous studies (0.5\u20131.5\u2009mM) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Canelas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Teusink et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wu et al., 2006</a>). The degree of inhibition showed similar dependence on ATP:ADP ratio for both ATP levels: 2.6 and 10\u2009mM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). All\u00a0the above results show that ADP level is a significant factor determining the ATPase activity of Hsp104."

Hsp104 in the absence of the cooperating Hsp70 chaperone is able to bind and translocate proteins which adopt disordered conformation but are not aggregated, such as reduced carboxymethylated lactalbumine (RCMLa) (<a href=\"#bib7\">B\u00f6sl et\u00a0al., 2005</a>). We labeled RCMLa with fluorescein (fRCMLa) and employed it to monitor its translocation by Hsp104 in real time. We used Hsp104 variant termed HAP which was modified to interact with the\u00a0bacterial protease ClpP so that every polypeptide that\u00a0has been translocated through the central channel of HAP undergoes proteolysis (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tessarz et al., 2008</a>). When fRCMLa was incubated with HAP and ClpP at 2.6\u2009mM ATP, we observed a decrease in fluorescence anisotropy, corresponding to fRCMLa degradation and release of short fluorescein-labeled peptides (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We plotted the fRCMLa proteolysis rate against ADP concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). With increasing level of ADP fRCMLa proteolysis by HAP-ClpP slowed down, with a 10-fold reduction of the activity at 1\u2009mM ADP. Thus, under the physiological proportions of adenine nucleotides not only ATP hydrolysis but also translocation of disordered proteins by Hsp104 is impaired. The effect of ADP was similar in an analogous experiments carried out at 10\u2009mM ATP and at different fRCMLa concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), showing that the degree of inhibition depends predominantly on ATP:ADP ratio."

We used an Hsp104 E285Q variant in the\u00a0binding experiments because a complex between this mutant and the substrate is much more stable compared to the WT Hsp104 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Franzmann et al., 2011</a>). The E285Q mutation in the\u00a0Walker B motif affects NBD1 in such way that this domain binds ATP but is not able to hydrolyze it (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schaupp et al., 2007</a>). As a result, NBD2 remains the only hydrolytically active domain of Hsp104. We chose Hsp104 E285Q because its ATPase activity was inhibited by ADP to the same degree as of the WT protein, while Hsp104 with an analogous Walker B substitution in NBD2 (E687Q) showed much lower degree of inhibition under the same conditions (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We used fluorescence anisotropy to monitor Hsp104 E285Q interaction with fRCMLa. We added Hsp104 E285Q to fRCMLa at constant 2.6\u2009mM ATP and changing ADP concentrations and recorded an increase in the\u00a0anisotropy signal over time, reflecting binding of Hsp104 to fRCMLa (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We plotted the binding rate against ADP concentration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). At 2.6\u2009mM ATP\u00a0we observed fast binding of fRCMLa but with increasing ADP the rate of fRCMLa binding decreased, reaching 3% at 1\u2009mM ADP. Addition of an excess of unlabeled RCMLa to the Hsp104 E285Q-fRCMLa complex caused a drop in fluorescence anisotropy, as the fluorescently labeled substrate was released from Hsp104 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

The recovery of aggregated proteins, however, contrary to the processing of disordered proteins, requires collaboration with the Hsp70-Hsp40 machinery. Therefore, we asked how the physiological concentrations of adenine nucleotides affect protein disaggregation performed by Hsp104 in cooperation with the Hsp70 chaperone. As a substrate we used heat-aggregated GFP, which does not require Hsp70 for folding downstream of Hsp104. We incubated aggregated GFP with Hsp104 in the presence of Hsp70 (Ssa1) and its co-chaperone Hsp40 (Sis1) at constant 2.6\u2009mM ATP and changing ADP concentrations and monitored the recovery of GFP fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We plotted the initial GFP folding rate against ADP concentration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Strikingly, at 1\u2009mM ADP the rate of disaggregation and refolding of GFP was reduced only by 50%. The inhibitory effect of ADP on protein disaggregation by the Hsp104-Hsp70 bi-chaperone system was therefore much milder than the 90% decrease in\u00a0the protein translocation activity and the 97% reduction in\u00a0the substrate binding rate observed for Hsp104 alone under the same conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,F</a>).

When ADP accumulated, Hsp104 D484K was an efficient disaggregase only when its Hsp70 partner was present.

The upstream role of Hsp70 in disaggregation involves initial aggregate remodeling (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zietkiewicz et al., 2006</a>) and targeting Hsp104 to aggregates (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acebr\u00f3n et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Okuda et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Seyffer et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, we asked whether the latter function of Hsp70 enables\u00a0disaggregation in the presence of ADP. To measure the upstream effect of Hsp70 we monitored GFP refolding by the derepressed Hsp104 D484K variant in the presence or absence of the Hsp70 chaperone system (Ssa1 and Ydj1) at the increasing levels of GFP aggregates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We fitted the Michaelis-Menten curve to the disaggregation rates plotted versus GFP concentrations and calculated the <i>apparent K<sub>M\u00a0</sub></i>values to evaluate Hsp104 affinities for the aggregated substrate. Strikingly, Hsp70 increased Hsp104 affinity towards GFP over 25\u00a0times (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). When we compared the influence of ADP and Hsp70 on Hsp104 affinity towards aggregates, the effect of Hsp70 was sufficient to compensate for\u00a0the two-fold increase in the <i>apparent K<sub>M</sub> </i>caused by ADP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This result suggests that Hsp70-dependent support in targeting of Hsp104 to aggregates allows overcoming ADP inhibition of protein substrate binding."

As reported previously, Hsp70 protein interacts with RCMLa (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bimston et al., 1998</a>). In accordance, an addition of Hsp70-Hsp40 to fRCMLa resulted in a sharp increase in the\u00a0fluorescence anisotropy signal, indicating that Hsp70-fRCMLa complex is formed (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Next, we examined the Hsp70 and ADP influence on fRCMLa processing by Hsp104 HAP variant accompanied by ClpP. Addition of Hsp70 did not promote fRCMLa translocation and degradation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Moreover, ADP inhibited the degradation of fRCMLa regardless of the presence of Hsp70 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Interestingly, addition of Hsp70 did not result in increased fRCMLa proteolysis but inhibition of this process was observed. Since both Hsp104 and Hsp70 are able to bind to the same substrate, the observed inhibition can be explained by competition between Hsp70 and Hsp104 for binding to fRCMLa."

Under the physiological ATP and ADP concentrations, the excess of RCMLa stimulated Hsp104 ATPase activity\u00a0three times more efficiently as compared to the reaction where no ADP was added. This difference was over two times more pronounced for the derepressed Hsp104 D484K variant. Since ADP competes with ATP for binding to Hsp104, the observed effects suggest that protein translocation could affect Hsp104 affinity towards nucleotides. To verify it, we measured the ATPase activity of Hsp104 at varying ATP concentrations either at the saturating concentration of RCMLa or in the absence of RCMLa (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This experimental setup allowed us to compare Hsp104 affinities towards ATP in the presence and absence of the translocated substrate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). In the presence of RCMLa, the <i>apparent K<sub>M</sub></i> decreased five times, implying that polypeptide translocation highly increases Hsp104 affinity towards ATP. Together, these results show that translocation of the polypeptides through the Hsp104 central channel facilitates ATP binding to Hsp104 and allows to overcome the ADP-dependent inhibition of its ATPase activity."

While ADP negatively affects binding of the protein substrates, Hsp70 substantially increases Hsp104 affinity towards aggregated proteins. At the same time, Hsp70 does not promote processing of disordered, non-aggregated proteins. As a consequence, at the physiological concentrations of adenine nucleotides and in the presence of the Hsp70 chaperone renaturation of aggregated proteins by Hsp104 is efficient but binding and translocation of non-aggregated proteins is strongly inhibited by ADP."

Under such conditions the activities displayed by Hsp104 alone, including ATP hydrolysis as well as binding and translocation of substrate proteins, are highly limited (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Protein translocation through the central channel is initiated only when Hsp70 specifically recruits Hsp104 for disaggregation by facilitating its interaction with the aggregate. Translocation of the polypeptide substrate leads to the release of ADP inhibition. The release is due to a several-fold increase in Hsp104 affinity towards ATP. Consequently, the process of polypeptide threading highly stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsp104 at non-saturating concentration of ATP and in the presence of the competitive inhibitor, ADP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

According to the previous studies (<a href=\"#bib8\">Canelas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Teusink et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wu et al., 2006</a>), the cellular level of ATP (2.1\u20133.4\u2009mM) is below saturation for Hsp104 (~10\u2009mM). Furthermore, depending on growth conditions, residual ADP can constitute a significant fraction of adenine nucleotides in the cytosol (up to 1.5\u2009mM) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Canelas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Larsson et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Osorio et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ozalp et al., 2010</a>). The conditions in yeast cytoplasm are therefore far from optimal for the biochemical activity of the disaggregase. In this work we measured the ATPase and the protein-processing activity of Hsp104 under a broad range ADP concentrations, establishing the relation between the degree of inhibition and ATP:ADP ratio. The highest ATP:ADP ratio reported for yeast cells is 7:1 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Theobald et al., 1997</a>). Even at slightly higher ATP:ADP ratio 10:1 the activity displayed by Hsp104 alone was highly reduced (by over 50%) and under the intermediate physiological ATP:ADP ratio 2.6:1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Canelas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ozalp et al., 2010</a>) it was almost completely abolished (inhibited by 90% or more). In contrast, the disaggregation activity of Hsp104 in the presence of Hsp70 at the\u00a0ATP:ADP ratio 10:1 was reduced by less than 10% and at 2.6:1 - to 50%. 90% degree\u00a0of\u00a0inhibition occured below the\u00a0ATP:ADP ratio 1.3:1, while the lowest proportion of ATP to ADP reported in yeast is 1.4:1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hynne et al., 2001</a>). Therefore, inhibition by ADP and the counteracting effect of Hsp70 regulate Hsp104 activity across a whole range of physiological proportions between ATP and ADP."

Agreeably, we observed that ADP strongly inhibits the ATPase activity in NBD2 in the Hsp104 E285Q variant and exerts much milder effect on ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104 E687Q variant, in which NBD1 is the only active ATPase domain.

It has been established before that when ADP occupies NBD2, NBD1 is mostly in the nucleotide-free state (<a href=\"#bib16\">Franzmann et al., 2011</a>). It has also been reported that the absence of nucleotide in NBD1 affects the ATPase activity of the neighbouring NBDs and interrupts protein binding to Hsp104 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schaupp et al., 2007</a>). This could explain how the inhibitory effect of ADP on NBD2 is allosterically transmitted between all the ATPase domains within the hexamer."

In the active mode the presence of the polypeptide in the central channel facilitates ATP binding, and most likely accelerates the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle: ADP release. These findings shed new light on how unfolded substrates stimulate ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104, however to fully understand the underlying mechanism detailed structural data collected in\u00a0the presence of a substrate would be required."

And the robustness of this correlation across a range of ATP/ADP concentrations. This point is crucial especially given the comments of reviewer three on the two papers cited in reference for the choice of the canonical concentration of ATP and ADP in the yeast cytosol: As the concern regarding the validity of the choice of nucleotide concentration would be mitigated if the aforementioned correlations were documented over a broad range of ATP/ADP concentrations."

HAP-D484K in presence of ADP seems as active as HAP-WT in absence of ADP. This conflicts with the statement that hyperactive HAP-D484K is as sensitive as HAP-WT towards ADP inhibition. Processing of fRCLMa by HAP-D484K is almost complete after 5 min incubation; might this be the reason that no inhibition was observed. The authors should clarify this point and revise their Discussion accordingly."

However, ADP is strongly inhibiting RCLMa processing by the HAP variant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) at the same time. Since HAP binds and degrades RCLMa (together with ClpP) one would expect resistance towards ADP, which is however not the case. Could the RCLMa concentration used here be too low to affect the affinity of HAP for ATP (as ATPase assays were done under much higher, saturating RCLMa concentrations). Please discuss these issues in an effort to reconcile the divergent findings."

Using a mutant Hsp104 that is frozen in the active allosteric state (normally induced by Hsp70) they go on to show that this stimulatory effect is <i>not</i> due to allosteric activation of Hsp104 by Hsp70-Hsp40 but rather by their ability to \"feed\" substrate proteins to the Hsp104 machine. These last observations are rendered interpretable by the finding that substrate proteins stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp104 and overcome the inhibitory effect of ADP. A final physiological touch is added by the observation that the stimulatory effect of Hsp70-Hsp40 of the reluctant (ADP-inhibited) Hsp104 is limited to aggregated proteins and does not extend to natively disordered protein. The story hangs together well."

Hsp70 recruits Hsp104 to protein aggregates by interacting with Hsp104 M-domains, thereby liberating Hsp104 ATPase activity from M-domain repression. Derepressed Hsp104 M-domain mutant variants exhibit unleashed ATPase activity and become partially independent from Hsp70. Here, the authors show that physiological ATP/ADP ratios fine-tune Hsp70-Hsp104 cooperation by making Hsp104 activity more dependent on the Hsp70 partner. It is demonstrated that accumulation of ADP strongly poisons Hsp104 ATPase and threading activity in absence of Hsp70. This can be explained by previous findings showing higher affinity of Hsp104 for ADP as compared to ATP. Remarkably, the inhibitory effect of ADP is overcome in presence of Hsp70, ensuring that Hsp104 activity is restricted to Hsp70-coated protein aggregates. The authors provide evidence that substrate binding and translocation increases Hsp104 affinity for ATP, overruling ADP inhibition. The substrate targeting function of Hsp70 is in line with the presented model."

In contrast ADP only inhibits 50% of the Hsp104-mediated disaggregation activity in the presence of Hsp70-Hsp40 at 1 mM ADP. The relative insensitivity of the disaggregation activity to ADP inhibition is explained by increased affinity for ATP during substrate translocation. The authors propose that ADP inhibits Hsp104 in the cell, and that Hsp70-Hsp40 promotes binding of Hsp104 to aggregates resulting in translocation that activates the ATPase activity."

It is under such non-optimal buffer conditions ('physiological condition'; 1 mM ADP and 2.6 mM ATP) that Hsp104 displays the potentially physiologically relevant behavior of activity-assay specific ADP inhibition; lower ADP inhibition of the Hsp70-Hsp40-dependent disaggregation activity than of the substrate-free ATPase and translocation activities.

Their model predicts that merely bringing Hsp104 to the vicinity of aggregates should result in acceleration of disaggregation and ATPase activity in the presence of ADP.

If we define a substantial inhibition as a 50% reduction of both the ATPase activity and the protein processing activity, then for Hsp104 alone the ATP:ADP ratio at which substantial inhibition occurs is 10:1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A, B, C, D</a>). For Hsp104 in the presence of the full disaggregation system (Hsp104-Hsp70-Hsp40) substantial inhibition is observed below ATP:ADP ratio 2.6:1 for the disaggregation activity or at 3.5:1 for the ATPase activity. If we take into consideration a 90% reduction in activity as a very strong inhibition, such effect for Hsp104 alone was observed below ATP:ADP ratio 2.6:1 and for Hsp104 assisted by Hsp70 in disaggregation \u2013 below 1.3:1. Thus, the relative Hsp104 activity is maintained above 50% only by the assistance of Hsp70 across ATP:ADP ratios 10:1-2.6:1 and above 10% \u2013 across ATP:ADP ratios from 2.6:1 to 1.3:1."

This important part of their model is readily testable by linking Hsp104 or its M-domain repositioned variant D484K to the aggregates using fusions to dimerization domains (e.g. leucine zippers, interacting charged \u03b1-helices, etc.). Their model predicts that merely bringing Hsp104 to the vicinity of aggregates should result in acceleration of disaggregation and ATPase activity in the presence of ADP. Such as direct test of the proposition that Hsp70-independent physical targeting regulates the ADP-inhibited ATPase rates potentially strengthens their model.</i>"

However, the approach suggested by reviewer 3 poses some serious technical problems. Firstly, to introduce a dimerization domain in a vicinity of the entrance to the central channel, N-terminal fusion (or close to the N-terminus) would be required. From our experience, fusion tags introduced close to the N-terminus of Hsp104 strongly impair the protein activity and instead C-terminal tags are used (for example: Erjavec, 2007, Coelho 2014). Secondly,if a dimerization domain was fused to a substrate protein prior to aggregation, its structure would be lost under the brutal aggregation conditions. One solution would be to carry out fusion with an unstable protein, which aggregates under conditions at which the dimerization domain is stable. Since the only labile model protein for studying disaggregation is Luciferase (standard aggregation temperature is 48\u00b0C), which requires Hsp70 for proper refolding, therefore a new assay system with other model substrate would have to be developed. Other solution would be to crosslink a dimerization domain to a pre-formed aggregate. Unfortunately, the latter approach would result in the dimerization domain placed only at the surface of an aggregate and after disaggregation of the outer layer by Hsp104 the interaction site would be lost. Due to the emerging challenges, testing our model by tethering Hsp104 to aggregates is a substantial project on its own."
