Here, we demonstrate a function for the <i>Drosophila</i> lipoprotein LTP in conveying information about dietary lipid composition to the brain to regulate Insulin signaling. When yeast lipids are present in the diet, free calcium levels rise in Blood Brain Barrier glial cells. This induces transport of LTP across the Blood Brain Barrier by two LDL receptor-related proteins: LRP1 and Megalin. LTP accumulates on specific neurons that connect to cells that produce Insulin-like peptides, and induces their release into the circulation. This increases systemic Insulin signaling and the rate of larval development on yeast-containing food compared with a plant-based food of similar nutritional content."

The fat body produces lipophorin, a protein which carries fat molecules in the hemolymph, and which is known to be able to move from the hemolymph to the brain and accumulate within the brain. The fat body also produces lipid transfer protein (or LTP), which transfers fats absorbed or made within the insect's gut onto lipophorin, and can also unload fat molecules to other insect cells.

Little is known about how nutrition-dependent signals pass the blood brain barrier (BBB) to convey this information. Like the vertebrate BBB, the BBB of <i>Drosophila</i> forms a tight barrier to passive transport, and is formed by highly conserved molecular components (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bundgaard and Abbott, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Stork et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abbott et al., 2010</a>). Its simple structure and genetic accessibility make it an ideal model to study how nutritional signals are communicated to the CNS. Insulin and Insulin-like growth factors are conserved systemic signals that regulate growth and metabolism in response to nutrition. Although <i>Drosophila</i> do not have a single pancreas-like organ, they do produce eight distinct <i>Drosophila</i> Insulin/IGF-like peptides (Dilps) that are expressed in different tissues (<a href=\"#bib33\">Riedel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Colombani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Garelli et al., 2012</a>). A set of three Dilps (Dilp2,3,5), released into circulation by Dilp-producing cells (IPCs) in the brain, have particularly important functions in regulating nutrition-dependent growth and sugar metabolism; ablation of IPCs in the CNS causes Diabetes-like phenotypes, slows growth and development, and produces small, long-lived adult flies (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rulifson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Broughton et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Partridge et al., 2011</a>). Systemic Insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) increases in response to dietary sugars, proteins and lipids. Sugars act on IPCs directly to promote Dilp release (<a href=\"#bib14\">Haselton and Fridell, 2010</a>), but other nutrients are sensed indirectly through signals from the fat body\u2014an organ analogous to vertebrate liver/adipose tissue (<a href=\"#bib10\">Colombani et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Geminard et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</a>)."

LTP transfers lipids from the intestine to LPP. These lipids include fatty acids from food, as well as from endogenous synthesis in the intestine (<a href=\"#bib26\">Palm et al., 2012</a>). LTP also unloads LPP lipids to other cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Van Heusden and Law, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Canavoso et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Parra-Peralbo and Culi, 2011</a>). LPP crosses the BBB and accumulates throughout the brain. It is required for nutrition-dependent exit of neural stem cells from quiescence (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brankatschk and Eaton, 2010</a>). Here, we investigate possible functions of LTP in the brain."

First instar brains have on average three LTP-positive neurons per brain lobe, increasing to 13 in early third instar larvae (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We used cell type-specific RNAi to distinguish whether LTP in the brain came from circulation, or whether it was produced in the CNS. Knock-down of <i>ltp</i> in the fat body reduces but does not eliminate LTP from circulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Staining larval brains from these animals for LTP reveals reduced staining on both neurons and glia (<a href=\"#media5 media6\">Videos 5 and 6</a>). To investigate this issue in more detail, we quantified LTP-positive neurons after knock-down of <i>ltp</i> in neurons, glia, or fat body. To ensure that we compared larvae of similar developmental stages we quantified glial cell numbers, which increase during larval development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2032,G\u2032</a>). Only fat body-specific <i>ltp</i> knock-down reduces neuronal LTP staining in the brain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

We first investigated whether LTP co-localized with Dilp2-positive neurons in early third instar larval brains<i>.</i> Dilp2 is present not only in IPCs, which lie dorso-lateral to the big commissure, but also on three neurons per hemisphere that do not produce Dilps. These neurons recruit Dilp2 from IPCs using IMPL2, a Dilp2-binding protein (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bader et al., 2013</a>). Although each hemisphere contains 7-8 neurons that express IMPL2 at this stage, only 3 of these detectably recruit Dilp2, and 2 of these 3 also accumulate LTP. These neurons can be unambiguously identified by the presence of both LTP and Dilp2, by their position, by lack of expression of <i>dilp2-GAL4</i>, and by expression of <i>impL2-GAL4</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Henceforth, we refer to these neurons as Dilp2-recruiting neurons (DRNs). Starting in the third larval instar, LTP accumulates on two specific DRNs located dorsal to the big commissure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although LTP is found on other neurons at earlier stages, its accumulation on DRNs is developmentally regulated. We also sometimes (6/20 sampled CNS) detect LTP on a subset of IPC neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus, upon entering the brain, LTP accumulates on IPCs and specific neurons that recruit Dilp2."

To ask whether neuronal LTP accumulation was regulated by nutrition, we asked how it responded to starvation. Late second instar larvae transferred from YF to food containing only glucose (GF) arrest growth and development. Systemic IIS is strongly reduced, as indicated by nuclear accumulation of FOXO in fat body cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,A\u2032</a>). Although LTP still circulates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), it accumulates on many fewer neurons in glucose-fed larvae, and is never detected on DRNs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2013F\u2033</a>).

LDF contains proteins and sugars, and has a similar caloric content to YF. However, larvae arrest on LDF because of the absence of sterols (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carvalho et al., 2010</a>), and systemic IIS is low (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,B\u2032</a>). Brains of LDF-fed larvae contain more LTP-positive neurons than those of glucose-fed larvae, but fewer than YF-reared larvae.

It has the same caloric content as YF, and slightly more lipid with a different fatty acid composition (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carvalho et al., 2012</a>, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Surprisingly, LTP is found only occasionally on DRNs in larvae transferred from YF to PF. Depletion of LTP on DRNs occurs within 16 hr of transfer and is reversible in the same time frame (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2013F\u2033</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,A\u2032,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Strikingly, despite the abundant calories derived from carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, feeding with PF specifically slows the larval growth phase without lengthening embryonic or pupal development. PF also dramatically extends adult lifespan compared to YF (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a>). This suggests that systemic IIS is reduced when larvae are fed with PF, compared to YF. Indeed, FOXO is predominantly nuclear in PF-reared larvae (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,D\u2032</a>)."

We first focused on the neuronal activity of the IPCs. Neuronal activity correlates with higher levels of intracellular free calcium, which can be detected using the GCaMP reporter (<a href=\"#bib32\">Reiff et al., 2005</a>). This GFP reporter increases its fluorescence in response to free calcium. We expressed the GCaMP construct either in IPC neurons (under the control of <i>dilp2-GAL4</i>) or in all neurons (under the control of <i>rab3-GAL4</i>) and compared GFP fluorescence in brains from YF and PF-reared larvae. While the activity of most neurons is not affected by feeding with these different foods (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), the activity of the IPCs was dramatically higher on YF than on PF (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>; <a href=\"#media7 media8\">Videos 7 and 8</a>). We quantified the number of IPCs exhibiting detectable fluorescence of the GCaMP reporter in 5 brains each of larvae fed with PF or YF. On YF, we detected activity of the GCaMP reporter in 4.8 \u00b1 0.6 neurons per brain lobe, while on PF only 1 \u00b1 1.3 neurons per brain lobe exhibited detectable reporter fluorescence. To ask whether higher neuronal activity of IPCs resulted in elevated release of Dilp2 into the hemolymph, we probed Western blots of hemolymph from YF and PF-reared larvae with antibodies to Dilp2. YF-reared animals have higher levels of circulating Dilp2 than PF-reared animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Thus, IPCs release more Dilp2 when animals are fed with YF. We next examined different molecular readouts of IIS in different tissues of PF and YF-reared larvae. YF increases PI3K activity in salivary glands (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>), as revealed by membrane localization of the PH<sup>GFP</sup> reporter construct. Furthermore, phosphoAKT levels are higher in fat bodies of YF-reared larvae (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Thus, feeding with YF activates IPCs, causing them to secrete more Dilp2 into circulation, thereby increasing systemic IIS."

To address this question, we inhibited synaptic release by knocking down Rabs 3 and 27\u2014two Rabs that both contribute to synaptic vesicle release (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mahoney et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pavlos et al., 2010</a>). To do this, we used homologous recombination to generate N-terminal YFP fusions of Rab3 and Rab27 at their endogenous chromosomal loci. This renders them sensitive to knock-down by anti-GFP RNAi (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Rabs 3 and 27 are expressed almost exclusively in neurons (manuscript in preparation). Thus, even for GAL4 drivers that are active in many tissues, this approach will affect only the neurons that express the GAL4 driver. When anti-GFP RNAi is driven in the IPCs in a background homozygous for both YFPRab3 and YFPRab27, larvae exhibit the slow growth phenotype characteristic of reduced IIS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Reducing levels of Rab3/Rab27 in the IMPL2-expressing neurons slows larval growth (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), and reduces phosphorylation of AKT in the fat body (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>).

Blocking transport of LTP across the BBB in YF-reared larvae could distinguish these possibilities. We therefore examined requirements for different LDL receptor family proteins in BBB transport of LTP. LTP localizes normally to DRNs and other neurons in larvae double mutant for LDL receptor homologues LpR1 and LpR2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, and <a href=\"#fig7s1 fig7s2 fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1\u20133</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Khaliullina et al., 2009</a>). Thus, LpR1 and LpR2 are not dominant transporters of LTP across the BBB. However, we discovered redundant functions for LRP1 and LRP2 in BBB transport of LTP. Both proteins are predominantly expressed in glial cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013F</a>). Double mutants die as third instar larvae (not shown). Although LTP circulates at normal levels (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), the number of LTP-positive neurons is reduced (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,A\u2032</a>). A similar phenotype is produced by glial-specific double knockdown of LRP1/2, which halves the number of LTP-positive neurons, and completely blocks localization to DRNs. Knock-down of either LRP alone produces intermediate phenotypes, suggesting they function redundantly (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G\u2013G\u2032\u2033</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Accumulation is specific to DRNs and neuronal LTP localization in these larvae precisely mimics its localization on YF. Furthermore, Western blotting shows that phosphorylation of AKT in the fat body increases compared to wild type larvae fed with PF (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). Taken together, these data show that YF increases free cytoplasmic Ca++ in BBB glia. This is sufficient for the specific transport of LTP to DRNs and elevated systemic IIS.

As particles that carry both endogenously synthesized and diet-derived lipids, lipoproteins are well-positioned to perform this function. Our data suggest that transport of LTP across the BBB to DRNs influences communication between DRNs and the Dilp-producing IPCs, increasing the release of Dilp2 into circulation. Since the IPCs also deliver Dilp2 to the DRNs, this indicates that these two neuronal populations may communicate bidirectionally. How might LTP affect the function of DRNs? One possibility is that it acts to deliver a signaling lipid to the DRNs. It could do so either directly, or indirectly by promoting lipid transfer from LPP, which is present throughout the brain (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brankatschk and Eaton, 2010</a>).

Feeding with yeast food increases free calcium in BBB glia, which then increases transport of LTP to DRNs. How might BBB cells detect the difference between yeast and plant food? Our data suggest differences in the lipid composition of yeast and plant-derived foods are responsible. Our previous work has shown that the lipids in these foods differ in their fatty acid composition. Yeast food has shorter and more saturated fatty acids than plant food (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carvalho et al., 2012</a>). How could these nutritional lipids affect the activity of BBB glia? Interestingly, differences in food fatty acid composition are directly reflected in the fatty acids present in membrane lipids of all larval tissues including the brain (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carvalho et al., 2012</a>)<i>.</i> Thus, it is possible that the bulk membrane properties of BBB glia are different on these two diets. Membrane lipid composition is known to affect a variety of signaling events (<a href=\"#bib37\">Simons and Toomre, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</a>). Alternatively, yeast food may influence the specific fatty acids present in signaling lipids that activate BBB glia."

How this specificity arises is an important question for the future. We note that a subset of glial cells within the brain also accumulates LTP derived from the fat body. Could these represent specific transport routes from the BBB? An alternative possibility is that transport depends on neuronal activity. Mammalian LRP1 promotes localized transfer of IGF in response to neuronal activity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nishijima et al., 2010</a>). Could LTP delivery by LRP1 and LRP2 in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain depend on similar mechanisms? The remarkable specificity of LTP trafficking in the <i>Drosophila</i> CNS provides a novel framework for understanding information flow between the circulation and the brain."

While it is clear that the vertebrate brain (unlike that of <i>Drosophila</i>) does not depend on lipoproteins to supply it with bulk sterols (<a href=\"#bib25\">Orth and Bellosta, 2012</a>), this does not rule out possible functions for these particles in nutrient sensing. The vertebrate cerebrospinal fluid is rich in many types of HDL particles, including those containing ApoA-1, which is not expressed in the brain\u2014this suggests that at least some lipoprotein particles in the brain may derive from the circulation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wang and Eckel, 2014</a>). Consistent with this idea, ApoA-I can target albumin-containing nanoparticles across the BBB in rodents (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zensi et al., 2010</a>). Recent work suggests that lipoproteins may be the source of specific Long Chain Fatty Acids that signal to the hypothalamus to regulate glucose homeostasis, since neuronal lipoprotein lipase is required for this process (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wang and Eckel, 2014</a>). Thus, it would be interesting to investigate whether circulating mammalian lipoproteins might reach a subset of neurons in the hypothalamus."

Here, we show that flies have evolved specific mechanisms to increase systemic IIS in response to yeast, independently of the number of calories in the diet or its proportions of sugars proteins and fats. What pressures could have driven the evolution of such mechanisms? In the wild, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> feed on rotting plant material and their diets comprise both fungal and plant components. <i>Drosophila</i> disperse yeasts and transfer them to breeding sites during oviposition improving the nutritional resources available to developing larvae (<a href=\"#bib23\">Markow and O'grady, 2008</a>). Yeast that are able to induce more rapid development of the agents that disperse them may propagate more efficiently. On the other hand, it has been noted that <i>Drosophila</i> species that feed on ephemeral nutrient sources like yeasts or flowers have more rapid rates of development (<a href=\"#bib23\">Markow and O'grady, 2008</a>) than other species. It may be that, even within a single species, the ability to adjust developmental rate to the presence of a short-lived resource is advantageous. Humans subsist on diets of both plant and animal materials that during most of evolution have differed in their availability. It would be interesting to investigate whether Insulin/IGF signaling in humans might respond to qualitative differences in the lipid composition of these nutritional components."

The authors use the correlation between LTP reduction/absence from DRNs and low systemic insulin signalling observed in their experiments (diet, FB&gt;LTP RNAi and glial depletion of LPR1/2) to imply and sometimes conclude that LTP in DRNs is required for IPC insulin release and high insulin signalling. Based on all the data provided, would it not be equally conceivable that LTP is transported across the blood brain barrier directly to the IPCs, and the presence/absence of LTPs in DRNs is merely a correlate of insulin release from the IPCS? As the authors state, DRNS recruit insulin from IPCs using Imp-L2, so this alternative explanation seems more likely. The issue is further complicated by the fact that 1) there are other Imp-L2-expressing neurons in the VNC, including other insulin-producing neurons and 2) to my knowledge (based on Bader et al J Cell Sci), and contrary to what the authors state, direct contact between the DRNS and IPCs has not been shown."

The authors link the function of LTP in the brain to nutrient sensation and systemic insulin signaling. They find a requirement for lipoproteins in mediating LTP recruitment to DRNs and that LTP function at DRNs is necessary for normally high levels of Insulin signaling. This is done by crossing the blood brain barrier. The failure to recruit LTP to these cells results in arrested development and growth as well as decreased Insulin signaling."

We now provide the complementary result: forcing LTP accumulation on DRNs is sufficient to activate systemic IIS even when larvae are fed with plant food. We were able to do these experiments because we made the novel discovery that yeast food, but not plant food, increases cytoplasmic free calcium in blood brain barrier glial cells. Strikingly, ectopically inducing calcium influx by over-expressing the TRPA1 calcium channel in BBB glia causes LTP to accumulate specifically on DRNs even when larvae are fed with plant food. Finally, calcium influx into BBB cells is sufficient to activate systemic IIS (as reflected by phosphorylation of AKT in the fat body) even when larvae are fed with plant food. This data is now included in (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). These experiments support the idea that yeast food lipids alter Ca++ signaling in BBB glial cells, inducing them to transport LTP to DRNs, which then signal to IPCs to release Dilps."

Thus, one intriguing speculation is that lipids from LTP might be more effectively mobilized to DRNs when these cells receive Dilps from IPCs.

Based on all the data provided, would it not be equally conceivable that LTP is transported across the blood brain barrier directly to the IPCs, and the presence/absence of LTPs in DRNs is merely a correlate of insulin release from the IPCS?
