In this study, we investigate whether the premotor circuitry of jaw and tongue motoneurons contain elements for coordination. Using a modified monosynaptic rabies virus-based transsynaptic tracing strategy, we systematically mapped premotor neurons for the jaw-closing masseter muscle and the tongue-protruding genioglossus muscle. The maps revealed that the two groups of premotor neurons are distributed in regions implicated in rhythmogenesis, descending motor control, and sensory feedback. Importantly, we discovered several premotor connection configurations that are ideally suited for coordinating bilaterally symmetric jaw movements, and for enabling co-activation of specific jaw, tongue, and facial muscles. Our findings suggest that shared premotor neurons that form specific multi-target connections with selected motoneurons are a simple and general solution to the problem of orofacial coordination."

In this study, we investigate whether the premotor circuitry of jaw and tongue motoneurons contain elements for coordination. Using a modified monosynaptic rabies virus-based transsynaptic tracing strategy, we systematically mapped premotor neurons for the jaw-closing masseter muscle and the tongue-protruding genioglossus muscle. The maps revealed that the two groups of premotor neurons are distributed in regions implicated in rhythmogenesis, descending motor control, and sensory feedback. Importantly, we discovered several premotor connection configurations that are ideally suited for coordinating bilaterally symmetric jaw movements, and for enabling co-activation of specific jaw, tongue, and facial muscles. Our findings suggest that shared premotor neurons that form specific multi-target connections with selected motoneurons are a simple and general solution to the problem of orofacial coordination."

Stanek et al. have now mapped these neural circuits using a cutting edge tracing technique in mice."

To identify the neural circuits responsible for tongue\u2013jaw coordination, Stanek et al. injected a modified version of the rabies virus into the muscles that move the jaw and/or the tongue. This modified virus, which was also labeled with a fluorescent protein, was able to jump \u2018backwards\u2019 across the junctions between the muscles and the motoneurons, and then back to the premotor neurons. The fluorescent label allowed the neural circuits to be visualized under a fluorescence microscope."

However, when viruses labeled with red fluorescent protein were injected into the muscles on the left side of the jaw, while viruses with green labels were injected into the muscles on the right side, a number of premotor neurons were found to display both red and green fluorescence. This indicates that some premotor neurons control muscles on both sides of the jaw, providing an effective means of coordinating bilateral muscle activity. A similar sharing of premotor neurons was observed between motoneurons that regulate jaw opening and those that trigger tongue protrusion, and between those that regulate jaw closing and tongue retraction."

                        "text": "Behaviors are executed through coordinated activity of multiple groups of motor neurons and their muscle targets. Coordination of jaw and tongue muscles during feeding behaviors represents one of the most intricate mechanisms of the motor system and has been observed in a wide range of animals including humans (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gerstner and Goldberg, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Thexton and McGarrick, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Takada et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Palmer et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ishiwata et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Miller, 2002</a>). Here, coordination concerns primarily the adjustment of both timing and sequence of muscle activation to enable smooth, effective jaw and tongue movements. Three basic forms of coordination are consistently observed in feeding behaviors. First, the left and right jaw muscle activities are temporally symmetric, which is necessary because the mandible is joined by ligaments at the midline. Second, during chewing the activity of the tongue and jaw muscles is held to a similar low frequency rhythm, with the tongue positioning food between the surfaces of the teeth while the jaw moves the teeth to break down food (<a href=\"#bib64\">Thexton and McGarrick, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Takada et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hiyama et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Naganuma et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yamamura et al., 2002</a>). Third, during chewing (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gerstner and Goldberg, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Naganuma et al., 2001</a>), licking (<a href=\"#bib69\">Travers et al., 1997</a>), and suckling (<a href=\"#bib65\">Thexton et al., 1998</a>), the tongue-protruding and jaw-opening muscles are co-active during jaw opening, while tongue-retracting and jaw-closing muscles are co-active during jaw closing. This co-activation also occurs in cortically-induced fictive mastication and occurs regardless of the frequency of cortical stimulation or the intensity of sensory stimuli applied (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gerstner and Goldberg, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 1993</a>)."

                        "text": "The neural architecture enabling these different yet specific forms of jaw-tongue-facial muscle coordination remain unclear. In the more extensively studied vertebrate spinal cord, the network that generates the coordinated and rhythmic muscle activity during locomotion is referred to as the central pattern generator (CPG). Separate CPGs are known to control separate limb muscles, with forelimb CPGs located in the cervical enlargement and hindlimb CPGs residing in the lumbar enlargements (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kiehn, 2011</a>). Limb coordination occurs through interactions between these separate CPGs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kiehn, 2011</a>). By analogy, it is conceivable that different orofacial muscles are also controlled by different CPGs with their interaction resulting in orofacial coordination, although the evidence for well-defined jaw, face, and tongue CPGs is lacking. On the other hand, previous studies injecting two different retrograde tracers into two different cranial motor nuclei have suggested the existence of neurons projecting to both nuclei (<a href=\"#bib4\">Amri et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Li et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kamogawa et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Popratiloff et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kondo et al., 2006</a>). However, due to limitations of the neural tracer technique, such as non-specific labeling of passing fibers and labeling of the entire nucleus rather than the motoneurons innervating specific muscles, whether there are common premotor neurons simultaneously innervating specific motoneuron groups enabling the above mentioned orofacial coordination remained unclear. In this study, we employed a recently established monosynaptic circuit tracing methodology to identify premotor neurons of the jaw-closing masseter and tongue-protruding genioglossus motoneurons (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Analysis of the resultant labeling reveals several premotor circuit elements that are well suited for the orofacial coordination observed in feeding behaviors."

A much lower efficiency of motoneuron infection from peripheral injection was observed at this later stage (19 \u00b1 4 motoneurons labeled in P8 injected animals; 35 \u00b1 6 motoneurons labeled in P1 injected animals; mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 3 samples per group), and the overall number of labeled premotor neurons was drastically reduced. Despite this, the labeled neurons were distributed in similar locations as those observed in the P1\u2192P8 tracing (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). Interestingly, in contrast to other regions, the number of labeled premotor neurons in the lateral paragigantocellular (LPGi) nucleus increased (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). When normalized against the number of infected motoneurons, twice as many LGPi neurons were labeled in the P8\u2192P15 tracing, suggesting more LPGi neurons form synapses with motoneurons, or individual LPGi neurons form synapses with more motoneurons. Due to the overall inefficiency of infection and transsynaptic spreading in P8 or older animals, all subsequent results were obtained from P1\u2192P8 tracing experiments."

Additionally, previous studies using retrograde dyes have labeled some reticular neurons projecting to both the left and right MoV, suggesting that bilateral coordination may also arise from inputs other than MoV interneurons (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kamogawa et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yoshida et al., 2005</a>). Our finding that masseter motoneurons on one side receive extensive premotor inputs from both ipsi- and contralateral reticular (Rt) neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>) suggests that premotor neurons in the reticular formation may be involved in producing synchronized and symmetric jaw motor activity on both sides."

When premotor neurons were labeled from viral injection into the left masseter muscle, we found that the right MoV nucleus was covered by fluorescently labeled axons (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), indicating that many premotor neurons project to motor nuclei on both sides. This is consistent with previous dye tracing studies (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kamogawa et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yoshida et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kondo et al., 2006</a>).

Thus, if any premotor neuron provided monosynaptic input to both the equivalent left and right masseter motoneurons, it would be labeled by both red and green \u0394G-RV, thereby appearing yellow. We observed many double-labeled yellow neurons in most of the premotor nuclei, including many in the caudal and rostral reticular formation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>), a few primary proprioceptive neurons in the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (MesV) (as distinguished from interneurons by their large spherical unipolar cell bodies (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lazarov and Chouchkov, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Verdier et al., 2004</a>)) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and inset), neurons in dorsal principle trigeminal nucleus (dPrV) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,E,F</a>), and neurons in the region above dPrV (dRt) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,F</a>). The number of double-labeled neurons was relatively few (\u223c8%). However, this is likely a significant under-representation. The masseter is a large muscle, and the chances of virus infecting functionally equivalent muscle fibers on both sides are very low to begin with. Additionally, when taking into account the stochastic nature of viral spreading at the synapses, the actual number of bilateral-projecting premotor neurons could be much higher than what we observed. The presence of premotor neurons innervating motoneurons on both sides throughout the jaw premotor circuitry provides a simple mechanism for directly synchronizing bilateral motoneuron activities."

We next wanted to map the premotor circuitry controlling the tongue, which is innervated by motoneurons located in the hypoglossal motor nucleus (MoXII). The genioglossus is the main tongue-protruding muscle. Partly due to its ease of access, the genioglossus has been a primary target for many previous studies investigating orofacial behaviors, including chewing, suckling, and licking (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gerstner and Goldberg, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sawczuk and Mosier, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kakizaki et al., 2002</a>). During rhythmic chewing, the genioglossus and masseter are activated with the same rhythm but in opposite phases, because activation of both at once could result in biting of the tongue. We investigated the premotor circuitry of the genioglossus motoneurons using a similar method as described for the masseter motoneurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). \u0394G-RV-EGFP was injected into the left genioglossus muscle of the tongue. However, due to the small size of the tongue in P1 mice and the amount of virus necessary to infect motor axons, in most animals some of the virus injected to the left side unavoidably spread to the right genioglossus. Thus, it was not feasible to map the premotor inputs solely to the genioglossus on one side."

As a summary of the key findings, the genioglossus premotor circuitry contains: (1) a large population of premotor neurons located bilaterally in the intermediate reticular formation (IRt), with fewer neurons in the lateral side of the reticular formation (in PCRt) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>); (2) premotor neurons located in trigeminal sensory nuclei mainly in caudal brainstem (SpC, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and a few in dPrV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and MesV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), as well as taste-related neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>); (3) neurons in the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) and midbrain reticular formation (dMRf, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>), which likely provide descending inputs; and (4) scattered cells in the midline and other brainstem structures (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

Furthermore, many genioglossus premotor axons were observed projecting into the central MoVII, but not other divisions of MoVII, on both sides of the brainstem (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, arrow; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). It is known that motoneurons in this central MoVII supply the posterior digastric muscle (jaw-opening and swallowing), the platysma muscle (jaw-depressing and lip-lowering), and the lower lip muscle (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ashwell, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hinrichsen and Watson, 1984</a>). To further examine whether these collateral projections indeed form synapses onto Dig or central MoVII motoneurons, we conducted anti-ChAT immunostaining on brainstems after \u0394G-RV-EGFP tracing from the genioglossus. Using high-resolution confocal microscopy, we observed GFP+ boutons directly contacting ChAT+ motoneurons in both the central MoVII (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>) and the Dig (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). These findings confirm that subsets of genioglossus premotor neurons simultaneously provide inputs to digastric and/or platysma/lower lip motoneurons. Considering many previous experimental observations of the co-activation of these muscles (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gerstner and Goldberg, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Travers et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Thexton et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Naganuma et al., 2001</a>), for example tongue protrusion always involves concomitant opening of the jaw and movement of the lower lip, such specifically shared premotor neurons are the simplest mechanism to generate co-activation of their target motoneurons."

Previous studies using retrograde tracers discovered the existence of neurons which project to both MoV and MoXII nuclei (<a href=\"#bib4\">Amri et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Li et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Travers et al., 2005</a>). The masseter exhibits some degree of synchronous activity with tongue-retractor muscles during feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kakizaki et al., 2002</a>), although they are not as tightly coordinated as the digastric and genioglossus muscles. Tongue-retractor motoneurons are located in the dorsal MoXII, as compared to tongue-protruder genioglossus motoneurons which are located in the ventral MoXII (<a href=\"#bib41\">McClung and Goldberg, 1999</a>). We thus re-examined the MoXII in ChAT-immunostained sections after \u0394G-RV infection of the left masseter muscle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013H</a>). We found that indeed a few masseter premotor axons specifically innervated dorsal MoXII (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,G</a>), and formed boutons opposing both contralateral and ipsilateral motoneurons located in this region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,H</a>). Thus, shared premotor neurons innervating both jaw-closing and some tongue-retracting motoneurons could indeed facilitate the co-activation of these two muscles."

The masseter neurons receive extensive MesV-derived proprioceptive and SpVo-derived somatosensory inputs, and the genioglossus neurons primarily receive SpVc-derived somatosensory inputs (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,F</a> with <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,F</a>), while both motoneuron populations receive sensory-related input from dPrV. Additionally, genioglossus motoneurons receive taste-related inputs from the NTS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, inset), while no labeling in the NTS was observed in the masseter premotor circuit. However, in the rostral reticular formation where many of the premotor neurons for both muscles are located, these populations are distributed in a similar pattern, suggestive of spatial intermingling of these two groups of premotor neurons."

To do this, we conducted a series of in situ hybridization experiments to examine the neurotransmitter phenotypes while simultaneously immunostaining for EGFP expressed in \u0394G-RV-EGFP-labeled premotor neurons. We focused our analysis on known markers for glutamatergic neurons (vesicular glutamate transporter 2: vGluT2), GABAergic neurons (glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 and 2: GAD1 and GAD2 mixed probe [GAD1/2]), and glycinergic neurons (glycine transporter 2: GlyT2).

These mixed phenotypes are also true for premotor neurons in most other regions in brainstem (data not shown). Due to viral toxicity, a portion of GFP+ neurons in these regions did not hybridize with any markers. Therefore, we could not reliably quantify the relative percentage of each type of neuron.

Even when humans chew more on one side, the contralateral masseter is simultaneously activated to a comparable extent (<a href=\"#bib44\">Moore, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Peyron et al., 2002</a>). By analogy to the studies investigating spinal locomotion circuits, one model of bilateral coordination involves the interaction between the jaw CPGs in the left and right brainstem (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A1</a>). Studies investigating the rhythm-generating properties of the brainstem after midline transection have supported this theory through the finding that sufficient circuitry exists on both sides of the brainstem to independently generate a rhythmic output (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chandler and Tal, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ihara et al., 2013</a>)."

We also labeled a sparse number of interneurons in the contralateral MoV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Furthermore, we observed axon terminals of premotor neurons transsynaptically labeled from left masseter motoneurons extensively innervating the contralateral (right) MoV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and forming boutons opposing motoneurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>), supporting the existence of large numbers of bilaterally projecting premotor neurons. Using two-color rabies-mediated tracing, we confirmed that premotor neurons that synapse onto left and right masseter motoneurons were present in many brainstem regions. It thus appears that the jaw premotor circuit includes the simplest configuration for bilateral coordination: a single premotor neuron that synapses on equivalent ipsilateral and contralateral motoneurons."

More specifically, the tongue-protruding genioglossus is active in phase with the jaw-opening digastric muscle and with the orbicularis oris of the lips under a wide range of conditions (<a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Takada et al., 1996</a>), and the tongue-retracting styloglossus is often active in phase with the jaw-closing masseter muscle (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kakizaki et al., 2002</a>). Previous work studying body muscle coordination in vertebrates and invertebrates showed that distinct CPGs which control motoneurons of different body segments may interact with each other to effect cross-muscle coordination (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cang and Friesen, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Briggman and Kristan, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Smarandache-Wellmann et al., 2014</a>). Because orofacial muscles are innervated by different groups of motoneurons located in MoXII, MoV, or MoVII, respectively, an analogous model would be that orofacial muscle co-activation is achieved by interaction between different CPGs that drive distinct motoneuron pools (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B1</a>). Our study discovered that axon collaterals from labeled genioglossus premotor neurons also innervate MoV motoneurons supplying the jaw-opening anterior digastric muscles, as well as the motoneurons located in the central part of the MoVII. The central MoVII supplies the posterior digastric muscle (jaw-opening and swallowing), the platysma muscle (which depresses the jaw and draws down the lower lip), and the lower lip muscle (<a href=\"#bib46\">Munro, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Ashwell, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hinrichsen and Watson, 1984</a>), which are all activated when the tongue is protruding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Additionally, we found that axon collaterals from labeled masseter premotor neurons also innervate motoneurons located in the dorsal MoXII, previously shown to innervate tongue-retractor muscles (<a href=\"#bib41\">McClung and Goldberg, 1999</a>). Our results indicate that specific premotor neurons simultaneously innervating multiple different groups of motoneurons provides the simplest circuit mechanism for enabling orofacial muscle co-activation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B2</a>). It is likely that such common premotor neurons are located in IRt because the majority of labeled jaw or tongue premotor neurons are located in that region."

Again, this could in theory be achieved by mutual inhibition of their separate CPGs, which might have similar rhythm-generation properties (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C1</a>). Here, we found that many premotor neurons for these two antagonist motor groups are located in a spatially intermixed pattern (especially those situated between the caudal end of MoVII and the rostral end of MoV) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). As this region is within the region proposed to contain the CPG for chewing (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chandler and Tal, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nozaki et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ihara et al., 2013</a>), our findings suggest that premotor neurons for different orofacial muscles are embedded within the same rhythm-generating network. Furthermore, previous studies examining intracellular potentials have found that masseter motoneurons receive rhythmic inhibitory and excitatory signals (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goldberg et al., 1982</a>), while genioglossus motoneurons receive only rhythmic excitatory signals (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sahara et al., 1988</a>). In the reticular region previously implicated in rhythm generation, we found that premotor neurons consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Thus, we propose a hypothetical model consistent with these results whereby premotor neurons in an extended rhythmogenic network could have the same rhythm but could have opposite phases of activity through local circuit interactions, resulting in rhythmic excitation of masseter motoneurons and anti-phase excitation of genioglossus motoneurons and inhibition of masseter motoneurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C2</a>)."

Our results support these findings, revealing that some NTS neurons provide monosynaptic input onto tongue-protruding genioglossus motoneurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). While sparse, this input could play a central role in the well-established taste reactivity test (<a href=\"#bib23\">Grill and Norgren, 1978b</a>), which has been used extensively in assessing the interaction of taste processing and ingestive behaviors (<a href=\"#bib19\">Flynn, 1995</a>). These stereotypic responses to controlled tastes have been found to be independent of cortical areas, and highly consistent across animals, suggesting that there may be a brainstem substrate for these behaviors (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grill and Norgren, 1978a</a>).

The DCN had not previously been implicated in directly contacting masseter or genioglossus motoneurons of the brainstem in the neonate. Furthermore, where DCN axons project into the brainstem in non-murine species, the projection path is known to be primarily ipsilateral, with only sparse contralateral projections (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cohen et al., 1958</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ruigrok and Voogd, 1990</a>). Previous retrograde or transsynaptic tracing studies in rodents did not comment on any deep cerebellar nuclei labeling, even in polysynaptic tracing experiments (<a href=\"#bib68\">Travers and Norgren, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fay and Norgren, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kolta et al., 2000</a>). By contrast, in our transsynaptic studies we found that the fastigial nucleus of the DCN provides inputs onto contralateral masseter motoneurons in the early postnatal mouse (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Additionally, we observed that a small number of neurons in both the fastigial and dentate nuclei of the DCN provide inputs onto genioglossus motoneurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Recently, the Allen Brain Institute published their adult mouse brain connectivity study (<a href=\"#bib51\">Oh et al., 2014</a>). We consulted their connectivity atlas for tracing from the fastigial and dentate nuclei of the DCN. Interestingly, fastigial neurons give rise to a major contralateral projection pathway (as well as ipsilateral projections) and sparse fastigial axon terminals can be seen inside the contralateral MoV (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Oh, et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, tracing results from either the fastigial or the dentate nucleus revealed sparse axon terminals inside MoXII (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Oh, et al., 2014</a>). Although these DCN innervations of contralateral MoV and MoXII are sparse in adult mice, it is possible that in newborn mice there are transiently more connections. Notably, in our P8\u2192P15 masseter tracing experiment, we did not observe any labeling in the DCN, supporting such transient projections from DCN to masseter and genioglossus motoneurons during early development."

Additionally, we provide high-resolution maps of premotor nuclei for these jaw and tongue motoneurons including sensory-related inputs and descending inputs. An important goal of future studies is to develop molecular tools that allow specific functional manipulation of individual groups of premotor neurons to establish their roles in controlling and coordinating a variety of orofacial behaviors."

In the case of the masseter injections, animals which showed infection of the overlying skin as evident by fluorescence were excluded from analysis. Subsequent complementation of this virus by rabies-G in motoneurons enabled transsynaptic, retrograde travel of the virus into presynaptic partners (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, right)."

Additionally, rabies virus infects neurons potentially through binding to the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) or other neuronal receptors irrespective of neurotransmitter phenotype, size, or morphology, enabling an unbiased assessment of presynaptic populations (<a href=\"#bib67\">Thoulouze et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Ugolini, 2010</a>)."

A previous study has reported small numbers of cholinergic neurons in the intermediate reticular region of the brainstem that project to MoV and MoXII (<a href=\"#bib70\">Travers et al., 2005</a>). To investigate whether there were any ChAT+ masseter or genioglossus premoter neurons labeled in our experiments, we conducted anti-ChAT immunostaining on samples infected with rabies. We found that only approximately 1\u20133 cells in the reticular regions in the samples we examined were labeled (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, such rare labeling was inconsistent in terms of rostral\u2013caudal position across samples, suggesting that secondary jumping from such neurons would be very sparse with inconsistent labeling patterns. We therefore focused our quantification and analysis on the premotor regions consistently labeled across all samples."

Transgenic mice expressing rabies glycoprotein (G) in cholinergic neurons received injections of rabies virus expressing a fluorophore (in place of G) in their masseter muscles and/or genioglossus muscles. This resulted in retrograde labeling of premotor neurons projecting directly to the motoneurons of these muscles. Many of the findings reported here reproduce or confirm previously reported results, but innovate in 2 ways. Firstly, as pointed out by the authors, the methods used eliminate the possibility that some of the retrograde labelling results from having the tracer taken up by fibers passing by the injection site. Secondly, they allow direct comparison of the distributions of masseteric and genioglossus premotor circuitries. Several novel findings emerge from this study: premotor neurons have bilateral projections to masseteric motoneurons; premotor neurons innervate both the jaw and tongue muscles and are intermingled in the same regions of the reticular formation; a strong premotor innervation of genioglossus motoneurons from NTS. In summary, the findings provide evidence that the connectivity of premotor neurons might underlie coordination of orofacial muscles."

Despite this, the labeled neurons were distributed in similar locations as those observed in the P1\u2192P8 tracing (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013Figure Supplement 1B-D</a>). Interestingly, in contrast to other regions, labeling of premotor neurons in the LPGi was increased (compare <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013Figure Supplement 1B</a> to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This is similar to that observed in our lab\u2019s previous work by <a href=\"#bib62\">Takatoh et al., 2013</a>, except that in the whisker premotor circuitry, LPGi labeling transitioned from none to many across development, whereas for masseter premotor circuitry, LPGi labeling transitioned from few to many across development (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013Figure Supplement 1</a>). It will be interesting in the future to functionally test the role of LPGi neurons presynaptic to different cranial motor neurons.

In our experiments, complementation of the virus is limited to occurring solely in cholinergic neurons, which express the rabies-G induced by the ChAT-Cre transgene. While this primarily limits complementation to within motoneurons, there are also central cholinergic neurons located in the reticular regions of the brainstem, and a previous retrograde tracing study found that some of these neurons project to the MoV and MoXII (<a href=\"#bib70\">Travers et al., 2005</a>). When we performed anti-ChAT staining on the viral-labeled brain samples, we observed occasional and rare labeling of cholinergic premotor neurons located in the reticular formation (about 1\u223c3 per brain).

Because it takes time for the virus to replicate and be complimented by the rabies glycoprotein, the chance of secondary \u201cjumping\u201d is further diminished.

First of all, we should have been more precise about where we observed the labeling in the DCN. The masseter premotor study consistently labeled neurons in the contralateral <i>fastigial</i> nucleus of the DCN, whereas the genioglossus premotor study sparsely labeled neurons in the ipsilateral <i>fastigial</i> and <i>dentate</i> nuclei of the DCN. We looked into this issue further. We are fortunate that the Allen Brain Institute just published their \u201cMouse Brain Connectivity Atlas\u201d which included anterograde tracing studies from the fastigial and dentate nuclei of the DCN. Importantly, fastigial neurons send a major projection <i>contralaterally</i> in addition to an ipsilateral projection, and a few axons can be seen projecting into the contralateral MoV even in the adult mouse (see images below, <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1</a>, obtained from the Allen Institute at <a href=\"http://connectivity.brain-map.org\">connectivity.brain-map.org</a>). Furthermore, a few axons from both the fastigial and dentate nuclei can be observed inside the MoXII (see images below from the Allen Institute at <a href=\"http://connectivity.brain-map.org\">connectivity.brain-map.org</a>). These sparse innervations in the adult raise the possibility that in neonatal mice there is a transient more elaborate projection from DCN to cranial motor nuclei that is later largely pruned away, but was detected by our P1\u2192P8 transsyanptic tracing. Additionally, we noted that our late-stage P8\u2192P15 tracing did not label any neurons in DCN, consistent with a transient synaptic contact between DCN neurons and masseter or genioglossus motoneurons at early neonatal stage.

Previous tracing experiments have found some contralateral projections from the deep cerebellar nuclei in the cat (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cohen et al., 1958</a>) and rat (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ruigrok and Voogd, 1990</a>). And as mentioned above (see response to #3a), recent anterograde tracing experiments conducted by the Allen Institute in the adult mouse from the fastigial nucleus show a major contralateral projection pathway with a few axons innervating the contralateral MoV (see attached images from <a href=\"http://connectivity.brain-map.org\">connectivity.brain-map.org</a>). Thus, it appears that the mouse has a more prominent contralateral projection from fastigial nucleus. Additionally, sparse processes are also visible extending into the MoXII from both the fastigial and dentate tracing by the Allen Institute. It is possible that the deep cerebellar nuclei are connected to motoneurons only temporarily during development (see response to 3a). We have included extended discussion on this labeling pattern in the Discussion, as per the reviewers\u2019 suggestion."
