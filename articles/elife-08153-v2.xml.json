The defining example is the exquisite sensitivity of multiple myeloma (MM) to 20S proteasome inhibitors, such as carfilzomib. However, MM patients invariably acquire resistance to these drugs. Using a next-generation shRNA platform, we found that proteostasis factors, including chaperones and stress-response regulators, controlled the response to carfilzomib. Paradoxically, 19S proteasome regulator knockdown induced resistance to carfilzomib in MM and non-MM cells. 19S subunit knockdown did not affect the activity of the 20S subunits targeted by carfilzomib nor their inhibition by the drug, suggesting an alternative mechanism, such as the selective accumulation of protective factors. In MM patients, lower 19S levels predicted a diminished response to carfilzomib-based therapies. Together, our findings suggest that an understanding of network rewiring can inform development of new combination therapies to overcome drug resistance."

The defining example is the exquisite sensitivity of multiple myeloma (MM) to 20S proteasome inhibitors, such as carfilzomib. However, MM patients invariably acquire resistance to these drugs. Using a next-generation shRNA platform, we found that proteostasis factors, including chaperones and stress-response regulators, controlled the response to carfilzomib. Paradoxically, 19S proteasome regulator knockdown induced resistance to carfilzomib in MM and non-MM cells. 19S subunit knockdown did not affect the activity of the 20S subunits targeted by carfilzomib nor their inhibition by the drug, suggesting an alternative mechanism, such as the selective accumulation of protective factors. In MM patients, lower 19S levels predicted a diminished response to carfilzomib-based therapies. Together, our findings suggest that an understanding of network rewiring can inform development of new combination therapies to overcome drug resistance."

One of these mechanisms is carried out by a large protein complex called the proteasome. Drugs that block the proteasome are toxic to all cells, and a type of blood cancer called multiple myeloma is particularly sensitive to these \u2018proteasome inhibitors\u2019. However, tumors in patients with multiple myeloma can also become resistant to these drugs."

The results of Acosta-Alvear et al. revealed how varying the levels of these two subunits influenced the sensitivity of cells to inhibitors. While decreasing the levels of catalytic subunits made the cells more sensitive, as expected, decreasing the level of regulatory subunits surprisingly made the cells resistant to the inhibitors. A possible explanation for this paradoxical result is that certain proteins are less effectively degraded by the proteasome in these cells, and that the buildup of these proteins protects the cells against the drugs."

The 26S proteasome is a large macromolecular machine composed of the 20S catalytic core and the 19S regulator, each comprised of more than a dozen different protein subunits. The 19S proteasome regulator binds polyubiquitinated proteins and catalyzes their deubiquitination and delivery to the 20S proteasome core for proteolysis. The 20S core proteasome can also associate with alternative proteasome regulators, such as the 11S complex (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nathan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Schmidt and Finley, 2014</a>)."

Consequences of proteasome inhibition leading to toxicity include the accumulation of proteasome substrates and the failure to recycle amino acids (<a href=\"#bib49\">Suraweera et al., 2012</a>). Intriguingly, multiple myeloma (MM) cells are hypersensitive to proteasome inhibition, and two inhibitors of the proteolytic activity of the 20S core, bortezomib and carfilzomib, have been approved for the treatment of MM patients (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shah and Orlowski, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Buac et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">R\u00f6llig et al., 2014</a>). The basis for the hypersensitivity of MM cells to proteasome inhibitors is unclear. One hypothesis poses that the high protein biosynthetic rate coupled the high secretory activity of the plasma cell-like MM cells results in an increased need for clearance of misfolded proteins by the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib28\">Meister et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bianchi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cenci et al., 2012</a>).

This library targets each mRNA by \u223c25 independent shRNAs and contains thousands of negative control shRNAs to enable robust detection of hit genes. We introduced sublibraries targeting 7712 genes involved in proteostasis, cancer, apoptosis, kinases, phosphatases and drug targets into U-266 MM cells. We then split this population into two subpopulations, each of which was grown either in the absence of drug or exposed to 1-hr pulses of carfilzomib followed by recovery (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This strategy allows for the identification of inherent vulnerabilities (<i>i.e.</i> genes affecting cell growth), as well as genes controlling sensitivity to proteasome inhibition. We identified several hundred genes that modified the response (either sensitizing or desensitizing) towards carfilzomib, as well as several hundred genes whose loss impacted cell growth (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary files 1 and 2</a>). Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of the hit genes from this primary screen identified the UPS, cell cycle, and translation as major functional categories controlling the cells' response towards proteasome inhibition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

We found that PSMD12 knockdown did not substantially increase 20S chymotrypsin-like activity, and did not affect its susceptibility to carfilzomib (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We confirmed these findings by an orthogonal approach measuring the amounts of accessible 20S subunits targeted by carfilzomib (\u03b25 and LMP7) in a proteasome constitutive/immunoproteasome subunit enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ProCISE (<a href=\"#bib37\">Parlati et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>).

Our data supports that 19S depletion alters the spectrum of proteasome substrates, leading to selective accumulation of factors involved in protein degradation.

Both mTOR and the EIF4F complex are master regulators of protein synthesis, and their depletion leads to increased resistance towards proteasome inhibition.

Growth and carfilzomib resistance phenotypes were quantified and p values for hit genes were calculated using gimap software (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kampmann et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">2014</a>) (<a href=\"http://gimap.ucsf.edu\">http://gimap.ucsf.edu</a>). Gene-based phenotypes were calculated by averaging the phenotypes of the 3 most extreme shRNAs targeting this gene, excluding shRNAs for which there were less than 50 sequencing reads in both the treated and the untreated population. This ad hoc metric is defined arbitrarily as a compromise between averaging fewer shRNAs (which may be too sensitive to outliers) and averaging too many shRNAs (which would include inactive shRNAs and thereby underestimate the effect size)."

Cells were combined in two triple-SILAC experiments as follows: Combination A: SILAC light: untreated negative-control; SILAC medium: bortezomib-treated ; SILAC heavy: PSMD6 knockdown and bortezomib-treated. Combination B: SILAC light: untreated negative-control; SILAC medium: PSMD6-knockdown no inhibitor; SILAC heavy: PSMD6-knockdown and bortezomib-treated. SILAC labeled cells were lysed with modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium-deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and N-ethylmaleimide (5 mM). The lysates were incubated for 10 min on ice and subsequently cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 \u00d7 g. An equal amount of protein was mixed from different SILAC states and proteins were precipitated by adding chilled acetone (final concentration 80%) and storing overnight at \u221220\u00b0C. Proteins were redissolved in denaturing buffer (6 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 10 mM HEPES pH 8.0) and subsequently reduced with dithiothreitol (1 mM) and alkylated with chloroacetamide (5.5 mM). Proteins were proteolysed with Lysyl endoproteinase C (Lys-C) for 6 hr and after fourfold dilution in water with trypsin overnight. The digestion was stopped by addition of trifluoroacetic acid, incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 hr and resulting precipitates removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4000 \u00d7 g. Cleared peptides were purified by reversed-phase Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). Di-Gly-lysine containing peptides were enriched using the Ubiquitin Remnant Motif Kit (Cell Signaling Technology), according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, peptides were eluted from the Sep-Pak C18 cartridges and incubated with 40 \u03bcl of anti-di-Gly-lysine antibody resin in 1X immunoaffinity purification (IAP) buffer on a rotational wheel for 4 hr at 4\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wagner et al., 2011</a>). After centrifugation, the supernatant (containing unbound peptides) was removed and used for proteome analysis (see below). The immunoenriched peptides were washed three times with 1X IAP buffer and two times with water. Peptides were eluted with 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Eluted peptides were fractionated into 6 fractions by micro-column-based strong-cation exchange chromatography (SCX) and desalted by reversed phase C18 Stage-tips. Similarly, for analysis of protein levels, unbound peptides from the anti-di-Gly-lysine enrichment (see above) were fractioned by micro-SCX and purified by reversed phase C18 Stage-tips."

The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode, automatically switching between MS and MS/MS. Survey full scan MS spectra (m/z 300\u20131200) were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer. The 10 most intense ions were sequentially isolated and fragmented by higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD). Peptides with an unassigned charge state, as well as peptides with a charge state less than +2 for proteome samples, and +3 for di-glycine-lysine enriched samples, were excluded from fragmentation. Fragment spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer. Raw MS data files were analyzed by the MaxQuant software version 1.4.1.1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cox and Mann, 2008</a>). Parent ion and MS/MS spectra were searched against protein sequences from the UniProt knowledge database using the Andromeda search engine. Spectra were searched with a mass tolerance of 6 ppm in the MS mode, 20 ppm for the MS/MS mode, strict trypsin specificity allowing up to two missed cleavage sites. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was searched as a fixed modification. Amino-terminal protein acetylation, methionine oxidation and N-ethylmaleimide modification of cysteines, and di-Gly-lysine were searched as variable modifications, and di-Gly-lysines were required to be located internally in the peptide sequence.

Based on a set of functional investigations into mechanism, the authors conclude that knockdown of 19S subunits upregulates autophagy, and thus the load that is normally impinging on the proteasome is redirected to a different pathway. If these claims are fully substantiated, the paper is obviously of considerable importance as it would shed new light on regulatory mechanisms that link the proteasome to other pathways for protein homeostasis."

That said, the reviewers are not persuaded by the claim that this is due to selective upregulation of autophagy upon diminution of 19S activity, but not upon diminution of 20S activity. The reviewers are of the opinion that the authors have not adequately ruled out more mundane interpretations of the core observation that emerged from the RNAi screen. In addition, the proposed upregulation of autophagy is based on indirect analysis (protein levels) and not direct measurement of autophagic flux."

It is clear from the literature (e.g. PMID 20460535) that continuous exposure vs. pulsatile exposure appears to yield a substantially different set of sensitizing and desensitizing factors, and so tests of the mechanistic hypothesis should mirror the conditions used to make the core observation.

This would control for a variety of potential effects on CFZ uptake, metabolism, efflux, etc. CFZ is a better agent to use than BTZ because it is completely irreversible and so the \u03b25 activity measured in dilute lysate should accurately reflect the \u03b25 activity that was present in the cells. Another issue is, why was PSMD6 used for this particular experiment? From the volcano plot in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> it exhibits one of the weakest effects of all the 19S subunits (albeit with one of the most highly significant P values). In addition, there is no direct comparison of PSMD6 knockdown vs. control, so it is unclear how big a change in CFZ EC50 is caused by PSMD6 knockdown (this was only done for PSMD12 in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). A target like PSMD12 that exhibits a strong effect and has been characterized in a head-to-head comparison would be an appropriate choice."

Is the improved response in patients with high levels of 19S due to enhanced activity of carfilzomib on the proteasome or enhanced activity of lenalidomide in mediating degradation of Ikaros? In addition, there is no information on assay and antibody validation to lend confidence that it is indeed S7 that is being measured.
