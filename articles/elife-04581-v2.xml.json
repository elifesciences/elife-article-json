How this membrane skeleton is developed and why it preferentially forms in axons are unknown. Here, we studied the developmental mechanism of this lattice structure. We found that this structure emerged early during axon development and propagated from proximal regions to distal ends of axons. Components of the axon initial segment were recruited to the lattice late during development. Formation of the lattice was regulated by the local concentration of \u03b2II spectrin, which is higher in axons than in dendrites. Increasing the dendritic concentration of \u03b2II spectrin by overexpression or by knocking out ankyrin B induced the formation of the periodic structure in dendrites, demonstrating that the spectrin concentration is a key determinant in the preferential development of this structure in axons and that ankyrin B is critical for the polarized distribution of \u03b2II spectrin in neurites."

How this membrane skeleton is developed and why it preferentially forms in axons are unknown. Here, we studied the developmental mechanism of this lattice structure. We found that this structure emerged early during axon development and propagated from proximal regions to distal ends of axons. Components of the axon initial segment were recruited to the lattice late during development. Formation of the lattice was regulated by the local concentration of \u03b2II spectrin, which is higher in axons than in dendrites. Increasing the dendritic concentration of \u03b2II spectrin by overexpression or by knocking out ankyrin B induced the formation of the periodic structure in dendrites, demonstrating that the spectrin concentration is a key determinant in the preferential development of this structure in axons and that ankyrin B is critical for the polarized distribution of \u03b2II spectrin in neurites."

Given that axons and dendrites have distinct roles in neuronal signaling, this uneven distribution of spectrin is likely to be one way in which these regions maintain the specific structures that support their individual functions."

Cytoskeletal proteins are important for maintaining the polarity of neurons. For example, actin and microtubules are essential for the growth and stabilization of axons, the trafficking of cargos to specific neurites, and the stabilization and plasticity of synapses (<a href=\"#bib37\">Luo, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dent and Gertler, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cingolani and Goda, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Stiess and Bradke, 2011</a>). Transient destabilization of actin at the tip of a neurite is sufficient to induce a dendrite to become an axon (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bradke and Dotti, 1999</a>). Increasing evidence also suggests an important role for spectrin in the maintenance of neuronal polarization, as well as the development and stabilization of axons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Galiano et al., 2012</a>). \u03b1II and \u03b2II spectrin are enriched in axons (<a href=\"#bib40\">Riederer et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Galiano et al., 2012</a>).

In this membrane skeleton, actin filaments form a ring-like structure that wraps around the circumference of axons. These actin rings are evenly spaced along the axon shaft with a period of \u223c190 nm and show a remarkably long-range order. Actin filaments in the rings are capped by adducin. Adjacent actin rings are connected by spectrin, likely in the form of \u03b1II-\u03b2II-spectrin heterotetramers, given the observations that the periodic \u03b2II spectrin rings alternate with the actin\u2013adducin rings along axons and that the observed 190 nm period matches the length of the spectrin tetramer. The ultrastructural organization of this quasi-one-dimensional, periodic lattice structure is different from the previously observed, two-dimensional polygonal membrane skeletal structure found in red blood cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Byers and Branton, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2013</a>), whereas an erythrocyte-like polygonal membrane skeletal was observed in the axon terminals at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pielage et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, this periodic structure preferentially forms in axons, with the actin in dendrites primarily adopting the form of long filaments running along the dendrite shaft (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 2013</a>). In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> that lack \u03b2 spectrin or carry a \u03b2 spectrin mutant, axons break more easily during animal movement (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>) and exhibit impaired touch sensation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Krieg et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that this structure may be important for the mechanical stability of axons and for sensing mechanical stimuli. This periodic lattice also organizes the axonal membrane by placing important membrane proteins, such as the voltage-gated sodium channels, into a periodic distribution (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 2013</a>)."

For example, it is unclear whether the periodic lattice develops during early or late stages of axon differentiation. Although protein factors previously identified to be important for axon differentiation tend to be enriched and function at the growing tips of axons (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Stiess and Bradke, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng and Poo, 2012</a>), it is unknown whether the actin\u2013spectrin lattice also initiates at the distal ends of axons or instead forms first in the proximal region near the cell body. Finally, the molecular mechanism that regulates the specific formation of this periodic structure in axons, instead of dendrites, remains a mystery. In this study, we addressed these important questions concerning the development of this newly discovered neuronal structure. We found that the periodic membrane skeleton initiated early during axon differentiation. The lattice structure originated in the axonal region adjacent to the cell body and propagated to the distal ends of axons. The lattice structure further matured by recruiting other components, and the matured membrane skeleton was highly stable. Multiple molecular factors played roles in regulating the formation of this structure. The lattice structure depended on intact microtubules. The high local concentration of \u03b2II spectrin in axons was the key determining factor for the specific formation of the lattice structure in axons, and artificially increasing the concentration of \u03b2II spectrin in dendrites was sufficient to induce the formation of the periodic lattice structure in dendrites. Remarkably ankyrin B was important for the polarized distribution of \u03b2II spectrin in neurites; in ankyrin B knockout mice, \u03b2II spectrin was evenly distributed in axons and dendrites, giving rise to a highly regular, periodic membrane skeleton in both dendrites and axons."

In dissociated hippocampal neuronal culture, neurons first display intense lamellipodial protrusive activity in stage 1, which then leads to the emergence of multiple immature neurites in stage 2 (\u223c1 Day in Vitro [DIV]). In stage 3 (DIV 2\u20134), one of these neurites breaks the symmetry and extends rapidly to become an axon. The other neurites then gradually acquire dendritic properties in stage 4 (DIV 4\u20137). In stage 5 (&gt;DIV 7), neurons continue to mature and form axon initial segments, dendritic spines, and synapses. In order to determine the developmental course of the periodic membrane skeletal structure, we fixed dissociated neurons at different developmental stages, immunostained for \u03b2II spectrin, and imaged using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), a super-resolution imaging method that relies on switching and localizing single molecules to acquire sub-diffraction limit images (<a href=\"#bib5\">Betzig et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hess et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rust et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Huang et al., 2008</a>)."

Consistent with our previous findings (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 2013</a>), \u03b2II spectrin adopted a highly regular, periodic pattern in all regions of the axonal shaft (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). Both Fourier transform and autocorrelation analyses showed that the \u03b2II spectrin adopted a periodic distribution with a period of \u223c190 nm (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly, actin filaments exhibited a highly periodic distribution along axon shafts (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Depolymerizing the actin filaments with latrunculin A (LatA) disrupted the periodic distribution of \u03b2II spectrin (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and knocking-down \u03b2II spectrin using shRNA led to a loss of the periodic actin distribution (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results indicate that the periodic organizations of actin and spectrin are interdependent, consistent with the model that adjacent actin rings are connected by the spectrin tetramers."

Interestingly, the periodic pattern of \u03b2II spectrin has already formed in the proximal region of this axon near the cell body, as shown by both Fourier transform and autocorrelation analyses of the STORM image (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>). However, the periodic distribution did not extend far\u2014the middle and distal parts of the same axon did not exhibit the periodic pattern (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>). Similar results were observed for other stage 3 neurons that we imaged. As neurons continued to mature, the periodic \u03b2II spectrin distribution extended to more distal regions of axons. By DIV 6, the periodic \u03b2II spectrin distribution extended for nearly the entire length of the axon, except for the very distal region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>). Using the autocorrelation amplitude at the first peak (\u223c190 nm) to quantify the degree of periodicity for the \u03b2II spectrin distributions, we found that the periodicity degraded quickly along axons in DIV 2 neurons but gradually extended to the distal end of the axon in later developmental stages until the structure eventually occupied nearly the entire axon (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the periodic membrane skeleton forms early during development, originates in proximal axon regions close to the cell body, and propagates toward the distal end of the axon."

Treatment of neurons with actin-depolymerizing drugs, cytochalasin D (CytoD), or LatA disrupted the periodicity of \u03b2II spectrin in DIV 3 neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013E</a>). The effect of actin-depolymerizing drugs set in quickly with the periodic \u03b2II spectrin distribution substantially disrupted after several minutes of LatA treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>), consistent with the drug acting directly on the lattice structure. These results indicate that actin is involved in the lattice structure during early neuronal development. The form of actin, however, appeared to be different during the early developmental stages as compared to that in mature axons. We have previously shown that the periodic pattern of actin was not directly observed in the STORM images during DIV 1\u20134. In DIV 5, the periodic actin pattern begins to appear in some neurons and become robustly observed in neurons at DIV 7 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 2013</a>). Similar results were observed here (data not shown). One possible interpretation is that actin existed in a less stable form during the early developmental stages and was not preserved by our sample treatment (fixation and extraction) prior to imaging. Consistent with the notion that actin filaments in the lattice structure were less stable during early developmental stages, the periodic structure of \u03b2II spectrin was more quickly disrupted by LatA treatment during early development than in older neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>)."

The lack of adducin capping may have contributed to the lower stability of actin during early development stages, although it is also possible that the lower stability of actin during the early development stages made it difficult to maintain the adducin pattern during cell fixation and extraction. Finally, it is formally possible that actin and adducin are not present in the periodic lattice structure during early developmental stages. However, we consider such a scenario to be less likely as it is difficult to imagine how spectrin tetramers themselves could self-assemble into a periodic lattice structure without the help of actin to crosslink multiple spectrin tetramers."

Notably, the expression level of \u03b2II spectrin remained high throughout the axons during this time (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). At this time, the distributions of ankyrin G and \u03b2IV spectrin were not periodic (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>), in contrast to the highly periodic \u03b2II spectrin in the proximal region of axons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Over time, both ankyrin G and \u03b2IV spectrin signals further increased in the proximal region of axons, and by DIV 12, the N-terminal domains of both ankyrin G and \u03b2IV spectrin adopted highly periodic distributions, indicating that these molecules were incorporated into the periodic lattice structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). Interestingly, the periodicity was substantially less pronounced for the C-terminal domain of \u03b2IV spectrin and undetectable for the C-terminal domain of ankyrin G (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). These results suggest that the N-terminal regions of these molecules were tightly incorporated in the periodic lattice structure, but their C-terminal regions were likely hanging off from the lattice structure and moving relatively freely. Notably, as ankyrin G and \u03b2IV spectrin became incorporated into the periodic lattice, we observed a decrease in the local concentration of \u03b2II spectrin at the AIS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

The efficiency of knockdown was demonstrated by a lack of \u03b2II spectrin signal in virus-infected, GFP-positive neurons (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). When infected by the virus at DIV 3, the enrichment of \u03b2IV spectrin in the AIS region appeared partially impaired by \u03b2II spectrin knockdown, though at least 60% of the neurons still exhibited enrichment of \u03b2IV spectrin in AIS. For these neurons, the periodicity of \u03b2IV spectrin was also partially disrupted in the \u03b2II spectrin-depleted neurons (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>), indicating that \u03b2II spectrin is important for the periodic assembly of \u03b2IV spectrin. On the other hand, when neurons were infected with the virus at DIV 7, \u03b2IV spectrin remained periodic even though \u03b2II spectrin was depleted (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013F</a>). Because it takes several days for pre-existing \u03b2II spectrin molecules to degrade (<a href=\"#bib48\">Susuki et al., 2011</a>), it is likely that \u03b2IV spectrin was already incorporated into the periodic lattice before the eventual depletion of \u03b2II spectrin when the virus was added late."

Local stabilization of microtubules is sufficient to induce axon formation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Witte et al., 2008</a>).

We thus tested whether microtubules play a role in the formation of the periodic membrane skeleton structure. In neurons treated with the microtubule-disrupting drug nocodazole (50 \u00b5M for 1 hr), the periodic pattern of \u03b2II spectrin was largely disrupted (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>).

Ankyrin B (ANK 2) is a molecule that binds to \u03b2II spectrin (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2013</a>). It is highly enriched in axons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chan et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kunimoto, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Engelhardt et al., 2013</a>) and recently found to be potentially linked with autism (<a href=\"#bib11\">De Rubeis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Iossifov et al., 2014</a>). We have shown previously that ankyrin B also adopts a partially periodic pattern in axons albeit with a lower regularity (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 2013</a>), potentially due to an incomplete occupancy of the ankyrin B binding sites on the lattice structure and the presence of ankyrin B on intracellular membranes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2013</a>). We thus asked whether ankyrin B is involved in regulating the formation of this periodic membrane skeleton in axons."

                                "text": "To address this question, we performed STORM imaging on disassociated hippocampal neurons from ankyrin B knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib43\">Scotland et al., 1998</a>) at DIV 10. Similar to wild-type neurons, ankyrin B knockout neurons still showed enrichment of MAP2 in dendrites with similar dendritic morphology, making dendrites easy to identify in these neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The periodic pattern of \u03b2II spectrin in axons was not perturbed by ankyrin B deletion and appeared quantitatively similar to that observed in control wild-type neurons (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Surprisingly, \u03b2II spectrin also adopted a highly regular, periodic distribution in all dendrites, with the periodicity quantitatively similar to that observed in axons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). This is in stark contrast to what we observed in wild-type neurons, where the distributions of \u03b2II spectrin in dendrites were largely irregular (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). The actin-capping protein adducin also adopted a periodic distribution in dendrites of ankyrin B knockout neurons, with quantitatively similar periodicity to that of \u03b2II spectrin. Knocking-down \u03b2II spectrin disrupted the periodic distribution of adducin, indicating that the periodic lattice structure in the dendrites of the ankyrin B knockout neurons also depended on \u03b2II spectrin (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data indicate that the formation of the periodic membrane skeleton does not require ankyrin B. Instead, ankyrin B is important for inhibiting the formation of this periodic lattice structure in dendrites."

Many molecular components, including actin, \u03b2II spectrin, adducin, ankyrin B, \u03b2IV spectrin, ankyrin G, and sodium channels, are present in this structure. We have observed this periodic membrane skeleton with STORM imaging of fixed cultured neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133</a>) and fixed brain tissue slices (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 2013</a>) using actin-binding phalloidin and immunolabeling of endogenously expressed proteins, as well as in live cultured neurons using fluorescent fusion proteins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Recently, this periodic structure has also been observed in live neurons using a cell-permeable actin-binding dye and STED imaging (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lukinavicius et al., 2014</a>). Since a single actin filament can interact with multiple spectrin tetramers, and a single spectrin tetramer can bind to two actin filaments, one at each end of the symmetric tetramer (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2013</a>), we reason that these crosslinking interactions are responsible for the formation of the lattice structure. Indeed, depolymerizing actin filaments disrupted the periodic distribution of \u03b2II spectrin, and knocking-down of \u03b2II spectrin disrupted the periodic distribution of actin (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2\u20133</a>). Because this lattice structure is associated with the axonal membrane, proper preservation of the membrane structure is essential for observing this structure. For example, a recent electron microscopy study of the AIS in neurons that has been subjected to detergent extraction of membrane before fixation did not show such periodic membrane skeleton (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jones et al., 2014</a>). Indeed when we applied the same \u2018fixation after membrane extraction\u2019 protocol to neurons, the structure was destroyed and not observed in STORM images (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). In this study, we investigated the developmental mechanism of this newly discovered axonal membrane skeleton."

In stage 3 neurons at DIV 2, when one neurite just broke the symmetry and became an axon (typically several times longer than other neurites), the periodic pattern of \u03b2II spectrin already emerged (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). It originated in the proximal axon regions near the cell bodies and gradually propagated to the distal ends of axons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This spatial distribution is in contrast to most previously identified signaling molecules involved in axon differentiation and development, which are enriched and function at the growing tip of axons (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Stiess and Bradke, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng and Poo, 2012</a>). After its initial appearance, the lattice structure continued to mature with the actin filaments becoming more stable, potentially because of capping by adducin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2, 3</a>). Once matured, the structure appeared highly stable with little movement and extremely slow turnover of its molecular components was observed in live neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This highly stable membrane skeleton may function to provide a stable mechanical support for axons. Indeed, deletion of \u03b2 spectrin from <i>C elegans</i> causes axons to break when the animals move (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>)."

However, the periodic membrane skeleton is not required for the initiation of axon differentiation because the periodic structure only started to form in stage 3, but not stage 2, a stage at which most signaling molecules for axon initiation exhibit high activity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cheng and Poo, 2012</a>). Moreover, neurons depleted of \u03b2II spectrin are also capable of forming long axons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Galiano et al., 2012</a>), though these axons may not be fully functional. Indeed, removal of \u03b1II or \u03b2II spectrin is embryonically lethal in mice (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Stankewich et al., 2011</a>) and AIS, the structure important for action potential generation, fails to assemble properly in neurons that are depleted of \u03b2II spectrin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Galiano et al., 2012</a>)."

During the early stages of axon development, the expression levels of ankyrin G and \u03b2IV spectrin were low in the proximal axon region, which was instead occupied by the periodic lattice comprising \u03b2II spectrin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Ankyrin G and \u03b2IV spectrin began to enrich in the proximal axon region later during axon development, at \u223cDIV 8 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib15\">Galiano et al., 2012</a>). The incorporation of ankyrin G and \u03b2IV spectrin into the periodic lattice was observed even later, at around DIV 12, replacing \u03b2II spectrin from the structure in the AIS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The enrichment and periodic assembly of the AIS components appeared to depend on \u03b2II spectrin (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Our data suggest the following developmental course for the AIS formation. Before the AIS is formed, actin and \u03b2II spectrin form a cohesive periodic lattice structure that covers the entire axonal shaft including the proximal axonal region. The AIS then forms by the enrichment of ankyrin G and \u03b2IV spectrin in the proximal axonal region and the replacement of \u03b2II spectrin by \u03b2IV spectrin in the periodic membrane skeleton. Potentially, ankyrin G, the master regulator of AIS that recruits other AIS components (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhou et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jenkins and Bennett, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2007</a>), is first enriched in the proximal axon region. Ankyrin G then recruits \u03b2IV spectrin to the same region and causes it to be incorporated in the periodic lattice. \u03b2IV spectrin in turn anchors ankyrin G into a periodic pattern as well. As an adaptor, ankyrin G then places sodium channels into a periodic distribution pattern in the AIS."

We found multiple molecular factors participate in this regulation. The periodic lattice structure depended on intact microtubules. Treatment with a microtubule-depolymerizing drug disrupts the structure in axons, whereas treatment with microtubule-stabilizing drugs induces the formation of the lattice structure in multiple neurites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Importantly, we found that the local concentration of \u03b2II spectrin is a determining factor for the formation of the lattice structure. The local concentration of \u03b2II spectrin is \u223c2 times higher in axons than in dendrites (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Remarkably, increasing the dendritic concentration of \u03b2II spectrin by overexpression induced the formation of the periodic lattice structure in all dendrites (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Interestingly, ankyrin B was critical for maintaining the polarized distribution of \u03b2II spectrin. Knocking out ankyrin B led to an even distribution of \u03b2II spectrin in dendrites and axons and the formation of a highly regular and cohesive periodic lattice structure in all dendrites (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Consistent with the notion that the increased concentration of \u03b2II spectrin in dendrites is responsible for inducing the formation of the periodic lattice structure in dendrites, knocking-down \u03b2II spectrin from ankyrin B knockout neurons disrupted the lattice structure (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results indicate that ankyrin B is critical for establishing a polarized distribution of \u03b2II spectrin in neurites with a higher concentration of \u03b2II spectrin in axons than in dendrites, which in turn promotes the formation of the periodic membrane skeleton in axons."

                        "text": "It is interesting to speculate how ankyrin B may establish such a polarized distribution of \u03b2II spectrin. The predominant form of ankyrin B during early neuronal development is a 440-kDa splice variant that is preferentially targeted to axons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kunimoto et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chan et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kunimoto, 1995</a>). Given that ankyrin B specifically binds to \u03b2II spectrin, we speculate that the distribution of ankyrin B in axons may help establishing the enrichment of \u03b2II spectrin in axons during early neuronal development. Moreover, we recently found that ankyrin B is a major cargo adaptor for dynactin and promotes axonal transport of proteins and organelles and that disruption of ankyrin B\u2013dynactin interaction significantly impairs the axonal transport of many proteins (<a href=\"#bib35a\">Lorenzo et al., 2014</a>). It is thus possible that ankyrin B may also preferentially transport \u03b2II spectrin into axons instead of dendrites. By maintaining a polarized distribution of \u03b2II spectrin in neurons, ankyrin B functions as a negative regulator for preventing the formation of the periodic membrane skeleton in dendrites. The exact mechanism by which ankyrin B maintains a polarized distribution of \u03b2II spectrin remains an interesting question for future investigation."

For imaging of actin, we used a similar method to label actin as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koestler et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 2013</a>). Briefly, the samples were simultaneously fixed and extracted for 1 min using a solution of 0.3% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde (GA) and 0.25% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in cytoskeleton buffer (CB, 10 mM MES, pH 6.1, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM glucose, and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and then post-fixed for 15 min in 2% (vol/vol) GA in CB, a previously established protocol for maintaining actin ultrastructure (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koestler et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 2013</a>). The GA-fixed samples were treated with freshly prepared 0.1% (wt/vol) sodium borohydride for 7 min to reduce background fluorescence caused by GA fixation. To label actin filaments, samples were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen A22287) overnight at 4\u00b0C or \u223c1 hr at room temperature. A concentration of \u223c0.5 \u00b5M phalloidin in PBS was used. To minimize the dissociation of phalloidin from actin during washing steps, actin labeling was performed after all other labeling steps (i.e., immunofluorescence of other molecular targets) were completed. The sample was washed 2\u20133 times with PBS and then immediately mounted for imaging."

A translation stage allowed the laser beams to be shifted towards the edge of the objective so that the emerging light reached the sample at incidence angles slightly smaller than the critical angle of the glass\u2013water interface, thus illuminating only the fluorophores within a few micrometers of the coverslip surface. A T660LPXR (Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT) was used as the dichroic mirror and an ET705/72M band-pass filter (Chroma) was used as the emission filter. For 3-dimensional (3D) STORM imaging, a cylindrical lens was inserted into the imaging path so that images of single molecules were elongated in <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> for molecules on the proximal and distal sides of the focal plane (relative to the objective), respectively (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huang et al., 2008</a>)."

After recording an image before photo-bleaching, a small region of the sample was bleached by shrinking the size of iris at the excitation light path for 10 s with the maximum laser power. Subsequently, the sample was imaged using the same power as that of pre-bleached image. The image was recorded at a frequency of 1 Hz. We used the unbleached regions in the image to calibrate the photo-bleaching effect during the entire recording time. The fluorescence recovery fraction was measured as the fluorescence intensity at the bleached region at indicated time vs the original intensity before photo-bleaching."

The authors showed that the membrane skeleton forms early on during neuronal differentiation, when axons are formed. Components of the axon initial segment, ankyrin G and \u03b2IV spectrin were integrated into the membrane skeleton late during development. \u03b2II spectrin was a positive regulator of membrane skeleton formation and ankyrin B was a negative regulator of membrane skeleton formation. In fact, overexpression of \u03b2II spectrin or knocking out of ankyrin B induced the formation of a periodic membrane skeleton in dendrites."

In addition, the authors demonstrate that detergent treatment causes the disruption of the periodic membrane skeleton, which shows why recent work from the Svitkina lab were unable to find a periodic membrane skeleton by EM.

The diameter variance reflects the extent of the tapering with a smaller variance indicating a less tapered and more uniform neurite.
