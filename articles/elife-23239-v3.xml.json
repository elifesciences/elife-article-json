Invasion involves discharge of rhoptries, specialized secretory organelles. Once intracellular, parasites induce increased nutrient uptake by generating new permeability pathways (NPP) including a <i>Plasmodium</i> surface anion channel (PSAC). RhopH1/Clag3, one member of the three-protein RhopH complex, is important for PSAC/NPP activity. However, the roles of the other members of the RhopH complex in PSAC/NPP establishment are unknown and it is unclear whether any of the RhopH proteins play a role in invasion. Here we demonstrate that RhopH3, the smallest component of the complex, is essential for parasite survival. Conditional truncation of RhopH3 substantially reduces invasive capacity. Those mutant parasites that do invade are defective in nutrient import and die. Our results identify a dual role for RhopH3 that links erythrocyte invasion to formation of the PSAC/NPP essential for parasite survival within host erythrocytes."

Invasion involves discharge of rhoptries, specialized secretory organelles. Once intracellular, parasites induce increased nutrient uptake by generating new permeability pathways (NPP) including a <i>Plasmodium</i> surface anion channel (PSAC). RhopH1/Clag3, one member of the three-protein RhopH complex, is important for PSAC/NPP activity. However, the roles of the other members of the RhopH complex in PSAC/NPP establishment are unknown and it is unclear whether any of the RhopH proteins play a role in invasion. Here we demonstrate that RhopH3, the smallest component of the complex, is essential for parasite survival. Conditional truncation of RhopH3 substantially reduces invasive capacity. Those mutant parasites that do invade are defective in nutrient import and die. Our results identify a dual role for RhopH3 that links erythrocyte invasion to formation of the PSAC/NPP essential for parasite survival within host erythrocytes."

Of the five <i>Plasmodium</i> species that infect humans, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> is responsible for nearly all the mortality associated with malaria. The disease is the result of asexual replication of the parasite in erythrocytes. For approximately the first half of the 48 hour <i>P. falciparum</i> intraerythrocytic life cycle, the parasite exists in a mononuclear trophozoite form (the earliest stages of which are generally referred to as ring stages), during which the parasite grows rapidly. During this phase, <i>P. falciparum</i>-infected erythrocytes gain the capacity to adhere to host vascular endothelium, a process that depends on the export of parasite proteins to form adhesive structures called knobs at the host erythrocyte surface. Nuclear division then commences, initiating differentiation into a schizont (a process called schizogony). This multinucleated form eventually undergoes segmentation to form invasive merozoites that egress upon rupture of the infected erythrocyte to invade new erythrocytes."

The largest of these organelles, called rhoptries, contain several proteins involved in adhesion to the host cell. Rhoptries are also thought to mediate formation of the nascent parasitophorous vacuole (PV), a membranous compartment that surrounds the parasite after entry has been completed (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carruthers and Sibley, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Counihan et al., 2013</a>). Despite the importance of rhoptries in invasion and subsequent host cell remodeling, a detailed understanding of the function of many rhoptry proteins is lacking. Rhoptries comprise at least two subdomains\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Counihan et al., 2013</a>) referred to as the rhoptry neck and the rhoptry\u00a0bulb. The contents of these subdomains likely mediate different functions, as reflected by evidence suggesting that they are released sequentially during invasion (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zuccala et al., 2012</a>). Proteins of the rhoptry neck are well conserved between <i>Plasmodium spp.</i> and the related apicomplexan parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, suggesting conserved functions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Counihan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Proellocks et al., 2010</a>). In contrast, proteins of the rhoptry bulb appear to be genus-specific, perhaps reflecting functions unique to each parasite (<a href=\"#bib15\">Counihan et al., 2013</a>). A function for several <i>P</i>.\u00a0<i>falciparum</i> rhoptry bulb proteins has been proposed, such as a role for a protein called RAMA in transport of proteins to the rhoptry (<a href=\"#bib51\">Richard et al., 2009</a>), but the inability to produce mutants lacking these proteins has precluded conclusive assignments of function (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kats et al., 2006</a>).

Whilst RhopH2 and RhopH3 are each encoded by single-copy genes, RhopH1/Clag, the largest component of the complex, exists in five isotypes encoded by separate genes entitled <i>clag2</i>, <i>clag3.1</i>, <i>clag3.2</i>, <i>clag8</i> and <i>clag9</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kaneko et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">2005</a>). RhopH1/Clag3.1 and RhopH1/Clag3.2 are nearly identical proteins that are expressed in a mutually exclusive manner (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chung et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Comeaux et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cort\u00e9s et al., 2007</a>). Each RhopH complex contains only one form of RhopH1/Clag (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kaneko et al., 2005</a>), so each parasite has the potential to produce four different RhopH complexes, differentiated by the particular RhopH1/Clag isotype bound. All members of the RhopH complex are expressed late in the intraerythrocytic cycle (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cooper et al., 1988</a>). The complex is then released during invasion (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ling et al., 2003</a>) and inserted into the nascent PV membrane (PVM) soon after parasite entry (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ling et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sam-Yellowe et al., 1988</a>)."

Pharmacological inhibition of RhopH1/Clag3.2 function was found to block PSAC/NPP activity, and selection for drug-resistant mutants revealed that part of the protein is exposed at the surface of the erythrocyte and that it may form the channel itself (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nguitragool et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sharma et al., 2015</a>). However, parasites that do not produce either RhopH1/Clag3.1 or RhopH1/Clag3.2 display only a small growth disadvantage (<a href=\"#bib11\">Comeaux et al., 2011</a>) and inhibition of the function of these proteins has only a small effect on parasite growth rates <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pillai et al., 2012</a>). Parasites lacking RhopH1/Clag9 are viable, and an early report suggested that loss of the <i>clag9</i> gene resulted in loss of binding to CD36 (<a href=\"#bib66\">Trenholme et al., 2000</a>). However, this has been disputed (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nacer et al., 2011</a>), as a subsequent study identified another gene closely linked to the <i>clag9</i> gene that is important for CD36 binding (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nacer et al., 2015</a>). Hence, whilst the function of RhopH1/Clag9 remains to be determined, like RhopH1/Clag3.1 and RhopH1/Clag 3.2, it is not essential.

For this, we used Cas9-mediated genome editing (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ghorbal et al., 2014</a>) to introduce synthetic introns containing <i>loxP</i> sites (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jones et al., 2016</a>) into the <i>rhopH3</i> gene such that they flanked an internal region spanning exons 4\u20136, the region of the gene that shows the highest level of conservation across <i>Plasmodium rhopH3</i> orthologs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) showed that, as expected, RhopH3 colocalized with the rhoptry marker RAP2 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bushell et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Crewther et al., 1990</a>) in mature schizonts of control <i>rhopH3-loxP</i> parasites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). However, in rapamycin-treated (RhopH3\u25b34\u20136) parasites, this colocalization was lost, although RAP2 was still detected in a punctate, apically-disposed pattern typical of rhoptries (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To determine the effects of this mistrafficking on localization of the other two RhopH complex proteins, control and rapamycin-treated <i>rhopH3-loxP</i> parasites were probed with anti-RAP2 as well as either anti-RhopH1/Clag3.1 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kaneko et al., 2005</a>) or anti-RhopH2 antibodies (<a href=\"#bib27\">Holder et al., 1985a</a>). This showed that, as in the case of RhopH3, rhoptry localization of both RhopH1/Clag3.1 and RhopH2 was lost in rapamycin-treated parasites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). These results indicated that truncation of RhopH3 to the RhopH3\u25b34\u20136 form resulted in mistrafficking of at least some components of the RhopH complex. To determine whether the mistrafficked rhoptry proteins all localized to the same parasite compartment, the parasites were co-stained with various combinations of antibodies against two of the three complex proteins. This showed that neither RhopH2 nor RhopH1/Clag3.1 colocalized with RhopH3\u25b34\u20136 in the mutant parasites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The RhopH2 and RhopH1/Clag3.1 signals were also distinct in the mutant parasites, although in this case some limited colocalization of these proteins was apparent (bottom images, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

To evaluate the effects of RhopH3 modification and mistrafficking on longer-term parasite viability, we first exploited a recently developed assay in which parasite replication is assessed in 96-well microplates over a period of 5\u00a0\u2013\u00a07 erythrocytic cycles by visualization of the localized lysis of host erythrocytes in static cultures in 96-well microplates. Under these conditions, successful parasite growth results in formation of microscopically discernible zones of clearance of erythrocytes referred to as plaques (<a href=\"#bib65\">Thomas et al., 2016</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, in three separate assays DMSO-treated <i>rhopH3-loxP</i> parasites seeded at\u00a0~10 parasites per well produced plaques in nearly every well, with a mean average of\u00a0~8 plaques per well for clone 5F5 and\u00a0~5 plaques per well for clone 4B11 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In contrast, in the plates seeded with an identical density of rapamycin-treated parasites, only\u00a0~10% of the wells contained plaques and no well contained more than one plaque (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Analysis by diagnostic PCR of several parasite clones isolated from individual plaques that appeared in plates seeded with rapamycin-treated parasites revealed that in all cases they derived from parasites that possessed an intact <i>rhopH3-loxP</i> gene, indicating that these corresponded to a small subpopulation of parasites in which excision of the floxed sequence had not taken place (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Further analysis by PCR of one of these non-excised clones showed that the DiCre cassette had been lost (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) probably due to a genomic rearrangement.

Cultures of the parental 1G5DC parasites as well as the DiCre-defective RhopH3 NE clone were similarly treated and monitored in parallel. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, whilst replication of the 1G5DC and RhopH3 NE parasites was unaffected by rapamycin treatment, the rapamycin-treated 5F5 and 4B11 clones showed a dramatic decrease in growth rate. However in both clones the appearance of replicating parasites was evident by cycle 3, suggesting that these might correspond to a minor population of normally-replicating non-excised parasites. Diagnostic PCR analysis of the 5F5 culture supported this notion. At the end of cycle 1, PCR using primers that distinguish between the excised and non-excised locus showed the expected highly efficient excision of the floxed <i>rhopH3-loxP</i> sequence in the rapamycin-treated culture, with the non-excised locus undetectable. However, periodic examination of the parasites by diagnostic PCR over the ensuing 6 erythrocytic cycles showed a time-dependent increase in the proportion of non-excised parasites in the rapamycin-treated culture, suggesting that the initially undetectable population of non-excised parasites gradually overgrew the cultures. This occurred likely as a result of a selective advantage conferred on them by the replication defect displayed by the RhopH3\u25b34\u20136 parasites. By cycle 5, the excised locus was hardly detectable in the rapamycin-treated culture (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Together with the results of the plaque assay, these results allowed us to conclude that truncation of RhopH3 results in complete loss of long-term parasite viability."

To explore this further, we examined growth and development of the mutants using microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained cultures. This showed that whereas rapamycin-treated <i>rhopH3-loxP</i> parasites appeared morphologically normal at the end of the cycle 1 as well as at the ring stage of cycle 2, development of the mutant parasites stalled at trophozoite stage in cycle 2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and the parasites did not develop into schizonts.

Since we observed a similar growth phenotype in cycle 2 in the RhopH3\u25b34\u20136 parasites, we decided to determine whether the developmental arrest was the result of a generalized defect in protein export. To do this, we examined the subcellular localization of KAHRP and MAHRP1, parasite proteins that are established markers for protein export and Maurer\u2019s clefts (intraerythrocytic membranous structures of parasite origin) respectively, in cycle 2 trophozoites derived from rapamycin-treated <i>rhopH3-loxP</i> parasites (<a href=\"#bib17\">Crabb et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Spycher et al., 2008</a>).

This block in development is a lethal event; no parasites carrying the mutant form of the <i>rhopH3-loxP</i> gene were recovered in a plaque assay and parasites with an intact <i>rhopH3-loxP</i> gene quickly outgrew the mutant parasites after rapamycin treatment. These results represent the first published evidence that RhopH3 is essential and mark the first time a rhoptry protein has been shown to have two separate, seemingly unrelated functions at different stages of the erythrocytic life cycle. RhopH3 is also the first rhoptry bulb protein to be directly assigned a role in invasion; other rhoptry proteins previously experimentally implicated in invasion are located in the rhoptry neck. The release of rhoptry neck proteins is considered the step at which the parasite commits to host cell entry (<a href=\"#bib61\">Srinivasan et al., 2011</a>), so the discovery of an important invasion factor that is presumably released later in the invasion pathway is important."

                        "text": "Whilst it was surprising that loss of the function of the RhopH complex leads to two different, seemingly unrelated, phenotypes, previous results had hinted at a role for RhopH3 and the complex in both processes. RhopH3, and proteolytic fragments of RhopH3, can bind to erythrocytes and to liposomes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sam-Yellowe and Perkins, 1990</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">1991</a>). This appears to occur even in the absence of other members of the RhopH complex, indicating that, for its role in invasion, RhopH3 may not require the function of the other proteins of the complex. Further supporting a role for RhopH3 in invasion is the finding that anti-RhopH3 antibodies can block invasion (<a href=\"#bib21\">Doury et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sam-Yellowe and Perkins, 1991</a>). Nonetheless it is curious that\u00a0~50% of the parasites still enter the erythrocyte in the absence of full-length RhopH3. RhopH3\u25b34\u20136 may retain sufficient activity in 50% of the parasites to allow invasion to take place. Alternatively, these parasites could use a RhopH3-independent pathway. Invasion by <i>P. falciparum</i> relies on several redundant pathways and there is precedent for a partial reduction of invasion by mutant parasites (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tham et al., 2012</a>). It will be of interest to determine whether invasion pathways that are currently thought to be redundant become essential in the absence of wild type RhopH3. A third possibility is that RhopH3 is involved in a post-invasion process. However, the invasion assay used here would detect all intracellular parasites that have completed invasion. We therefore favor the interpretation that the observed decrease in the number of newly invaded <i>rhopH3-loxP</i> parasites indicates that the invasion process is not completed in the mutants."

The loss of sorbitol sensitivity of erythrocytes infected with the RhopH3\u25b34\u20136 mutants and their impermeability to 5-ALA indicate that RhopH1/Clag3.1 (the RhopH1/Clag3 isotype expressed in these 3D7-derived parasites) and RhopH1/Clag3.2 are not functioning at the erythrocyte surface. RhopH1/Clag3 proteins are transported to the erythrocyte surface in a PEXEL-independent manner (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2014</a>) and are exposed on the surface of the erythrocyte (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nguitragool et al., 2014</a>), but the mechanism by which these proteins are transported from the rhoptry, beyond the PVM and to the erythrocyte plasma membrane is unknown. RhopH3 and RhopH2 are have been detected in the PVM immediately after invasion, (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sam-Yellowe et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hiller et al., 2003</a>), as well as in the erythrocyte at later developmental stages of the intraerythrocytic parasite (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Vincensini et al., 2008</a>). It is likely that mislocalization of RhopH3\u25b34\u20136 in merozoites prevents the proper, or properly timed, release of the complex during invasion and prevents RhopH1/Clag from being delivered to its correct location. As the RhopH1/Clag3.1 and RhopH1/Clag3.2 in the trophozoite stage parasite derives entirely from protein that is introduced during invasion (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ling et al., 2003</a>), mislocalization at the merozoite stage likely cannot be corrected by additional subsequent protein synthesis."

Little is known about these proteins other than the importance of the RhopH1/Clag3.1 and RhopH1/Clag3.2 proteins in the PSAC (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nguitragool et al., 2011</a>). However, chemical inhibition of RhopH1/Clag3.2 function and PSAC activity in parasites cultured in rich medium (RPMI 1640, the same medium used in this study) leads to only a small decrease in parasite viability (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pillai et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, parasites that do not produce RhopH1/Clag3.1 or RhopH1/Clag3.2 have only a minimal growth disadvantage compared to wild\u00a0type parasites in a competition assay (<a href=\"#bib11\">Comeaux et al., 2011</a>). Parasites lacking RhopH1/Clag9 have no apparent growth phenotype <i>in vitro</i> (the gene is absent from the D10 and T9-96 laboratory strains that lack part of chromosome 9) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chaiyaroj et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Day et al., 1993</a>). In contrast, parasites lacking RhopH1/Clag2 or RhopH1/Clag8 have not been reported so the essentiality of these proteins is unknown. We speculate that the RhopH3\u25b34\u20136 mutants very likely transport none of the RhopH1/Clag proteins to the erythrocyte surface. If so, the observed growth phenotype is therefore essentially that of a disruption of all the <i>clag</i> genes. The striking growth phenotype of this mutant is in stark contrast to the mild phenotype of RhopH1/Clag3.2 inhibition (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pillai et al., 2012</a>) or the absence of both the RhopH1/Clag3 proteins (<a href=\"#bib11\">Comeaux et al., 2011</a>) when the parasites are grown in RPMI. This may indicate that RhopH1/Clag2 and RhopH1/Clag8 play important roles in nutrient uptake as well, as previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pillai et al., 2012</a>), and that RhopH complexes containing several different RhopH1/Clag proteins together mediate the uptake of the nutrients required for parasite growth in the infected erythrocyte. Interestingly, most <i>Plasmodium</i> species encode fewer RhopH1/Clag proteins than <i>P. falciparum</i>; some species possess only two <i>clag</i> genes, comprising a <i>clag9</i> orthologue and a second orthologue more closely related to the other <i>P. falciparum clag</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Counihan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kaneko et al., 2001</a>). In conclusion, our results raise the intriguing possibility that, in <i>P. falciparum</i>, other\u00a0RhopH1/Clag proteins, in addition to RhopH1/Clag3.1 and RhopH1/Clag3.2, function in nutrient import."

These parasites mutants were not defective in egress but partially affected in their ability to invade new host cells. Examination of these mutants in the second cycle of infection clearly uncovered a block in intraerythrocytic development. Importantly, the export of parasite proteins into the host cell and Maurer's cleft formation were not altered in the erythrocytes infected with parasites lacking full-length RhopH3 however they became resistant to sorbitol lysis, consistent with a lack of NPP activity, and showed an impairment in the update of 5-aminolevulinc acid."

This method measures the efficiency of new ring formation over a very short period, and is therefore much more suitable for determining invasion efficiency, independent of the capacity of the intraerythrocytic parasites to subsequently develop. Note that these revisions have also required some minor textual changes to the main text (subsection \u201cLoss of the RhopH complex leads to an invasion defect\u201d, last paragraph) and to the <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> legend."

We already know that the parasites form rings at the beginning of cycle 2, proving that some of them (~50%) do successfully invade. However, the technical challenges of imaging invasion in real time means that very few individual invasion events can be monitored per egress event (see for example Gilson and Crabb Int J Parasitol 39:91-96, 2009), with the result that it is not a suitable approach for <i>quantifying</i> invasion efficiency."

Since the cycle 2 parasites were all derived from the cycle 1 schizonts, we assume that the cycle 2 parasites also expressed exclusively truncated RhopH3. Note that this could not be formally proven by Western blot since the cycle 2 parasites never reached schizont stage (at which RhopH3 levels are maximal); however, the prominent phenotype displayed by the cycle 2 parasites is consistent with them expressing the mutant RhopH3 as expected."
