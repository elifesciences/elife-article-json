Here, we identified RNF10 as a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger. RNF10 is activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment and elicits discrete changes at the transcriptional level. RNF10 is enriched at the excitatory synapse where it associates with the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs and induction of long term potentiation (LTP) lead to the translocation of RNF10 from dendritic segments and dendritic spines to the nucleus. In particular, we provide evidence for importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus. Notably, RNF10 silencing prevents the maintenance of LTP as well as LTP-dependent structural modifications of dendritic spines."

Here, we identified RNF10 as a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger. RNF10 is activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment and elicits discrete changes at the transcriptional level. RNF10 is enriched at the excitatory synapse where it associates with the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs and induction of long term potentiation (LTP) lead to the translocation of RNF10 from dendritic segments and dendritic spines to the nucleus. In particular, we provide evidence for importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus. Notably, RNF10 silencing prevents the maintenance of LTP as well as LTP-dependent structural modifications of dendritic spines."

This process takes place at the junctions between neurons, which are known as synapses, and typically involves one of the cells releasing a chemical messenger that binds to receptors on the other cell. The binding triggers a cascade of events inside the recipient cell, including the production of new receptors and their insertion into the cell membrane. These changes strengthen the synapse and are thought to be one of the ways in which the brain establishes and maintains memories."

These genes are present inside the cell nucleus, which is located some distance away from the synapse. Studies have shown that signals can be sent from the nucleus to the synapse and vice versa, enabling the two parts of the cell to exchange information. Synapses that communicate using a chemical called glutamate have been particularly well studied; but it still remains unclear how the activation of receptors at these \u201cglutamatergic synapses\u201d is linked to activation of genes inside the nucleus at the molecular level."

Specifically, activation at synapses of a particularly common subtype of receptor, called NMDA, causes a protein called Ring Finger protein 10 (or RNF10 for short) to move from the synapse to the nucleus. To leave the synapse, RNF10 first has to bind to proteins called importins, which transport RNF10 into the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, RNF10 binds to another protein that interacts with the DNA to start the production of new synaptic proteins."

Synapses and nuclei are efficiently connected by bidirectional communication routes that enable transfer of information (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fainzilber et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Panayotis et al., 2015</a>) and regulate the transcription of genes associated with long-term structural changes of neuronal excitability (<a href=\"#bib26\">Karpova et al., 2012</a>). NMDAR activation plays a key role in this regard (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hardingham and Bading, 2010</a>). NMDARs are heteromeric ionotropic channels that are essential for excitatory neurotransmission (<a href=\"#bib39\">Paoletti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sanz-Clemente et al., 2013</a>). NMDARs differ in their subunit composition and, in the forebrain, they can be either di- or tri-heteromeric tetramers consisting of two GluN1 and either one or two GluN2A or GluN2B subunits (<a href=\"#bib39\">Paoletti et al., 2013</a>). GluN2A-containing NMDARs are mainly localized at the postsynaptic membrane, at the core of the postsynaptic density (PSD), while the GluN2B-containing NMDARs are also prominently present at extrasynaptic sites\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Hardingham and Bading, 2010</a>). In addition, numerous reports have indicated that GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDARs may play different roles in the modulation of synaptic plasticity and in central nervous system (CNS) disorders\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib39\">Paoletti et al., 2013</a>). These differences in receptor function are probably linked to the cytoplasmic C-tail of the two subunits, which are fairly different and contain specific motifs that bind to PSD-associated scaffolding proteins and to proteins involved in the downstream signal transduction of receptor activation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sanz-Clemente et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sun et al., 2016</a>)."

Recent work showed that following a fast genomic response to sustained rises in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a considerably slower process that depends on the nuclear import of proteins released from synapses couples local synaptic events to more specific gene expression programs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jordan and Kreutz, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ch'ng and Martin, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Karpova et al., 2012</a>). The classical active nuclear import pathway involves the binding of importin \u03b1 isoforms to nuclear localization signal (NLS) bearing cargo proteins. Interestingly, neuronal importins are present at synapses in association with NMDARs and the PSD (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dieterich et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jeffrey et al., 2009</a>) and they are able to translocate to the nucleus in response to NMDAR activation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Thompson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dieterich et al., 2008</a>). Proteomic studies have identified many proteins in purified synaptosomes that contain a NLS domain, and in the past 10 years, an impressive number of potential synaptonuclear messenger proteins have been characterized (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ch'ng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Karpova et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kaushik et al., 2014</a>). Many of these proteins contain a bona fide NLS and, in some cases, their binding with importin \u03b1 was shown to be essential for long-distance transport as importin \u03b1 can serve as an adaptor for nuclear trafficking of cargo in association with a dynein motor (<a href=\"#bib26\">Karpova et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ch'ng et al., 2012</a>)."

We obtained a number of positive clones including RNF10 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Seki et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hoshikawa et al., 2008</a>). In Schwann cells, RNF10 has a function in the transcriptional regulation of myelin formation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hoshikawa et al., 2008</a>). However, very little is known about the neuronal function of this protein (<a href=\"#bib47\">Seki et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hoshikawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Malik et al., 2013</a>). Using specific glial (GFAP) and neuronal (MAP2) markers, we confirmed that RNF10 is expressed in both glia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Interestingly, in neurons RNF10 displayed a nuclear and somatodendritic distribution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Moreover, transfected GFP-RNF10 displayed a prominent co-localization with PSD-95 and GluN2A at the dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Similarly, analysis of endogenous RNF10 in <i>DIV14</i> primary hippocampal neurons showed clustered RNF10 immunolabeling along dendrites and most puncta co-localized with GluN2A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, left panels) and PSD-95 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, right panels). PSDs from the rat hippocampus were purified to confirm the subcellular distribution of RNF10 by a biochemical approach. Subcellular fractionation demonstrated that RNF10 is associated with synaptic fractions and that it is prominently present in PSD fractions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Finally, immunofluorescence analysis of the CA1 region of the adult rat hippocampus revealed the presence of an intense signal for RNF10 in the soma and nuclei together with a punctate staining along MAP2-positive dendrites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>)."

To corroborate these results, we transfected HA-GluN1 and either GFP-GluN2A or GFP-GluN2B constructs in heterologous cells (COS-7) endogenously expressing RNF10.

Immunofluorescence assay revealed a high GFP-GluN2A(1\u20131049)/RNF10 clustering leading also to RNF10 redistribution from the\u00a0nucleus to the\u00a0cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; cytoplasm/nucleus ratio 0.98 \u00b1 0.04 vs 0.26 \u00b1 0.02 GFP-GluN2A(1\u20131049) vs untransfected, p&lt;0.001, n=10; unpaired Student\u2019s t-test), similarly to what has been described above for GFP-GluN2A construct (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Accordingly, RNF10 co-immunoprecipitated with both GFP-GluN2A and GFP-GluN2A (1\u20131049) from COS-7 lysates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), confirming that RNF10 interacts with the GluN2A juxta-membrane aa 839\u20131049 region. Interestingly, GluN2A(991\u20131029) domain previously shown to be responsible for a calcium-dependent binding of the NMDAR subunit with Calmodulin (CaM; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bajaj et al., 2014</a>). Based on this consideration, we first evaluated whether calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) could modulate GluN2A/RNF10 interaction. Using a pull-down assay we found that the presence of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (2\u2009mM) in the buffer significantly reduced GluN2A binding to GST-RNF10 FL (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>; -37.8% \u00b1 6.2%; p&lt;0.01).

As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bajaj et al., 2014</a>), Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced also the binding of CaM to the GluN2A fusion protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). In addition, co-incubation with exogenous CaM completely prevented the interaction between RNF10 and GluN2A in the pull-down assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>) only in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the buffer (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bajaj et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, a co-i.p. assay from COS-7 cells transfected with GFP, GFP-GluN2A or GFP-GluN2B confirmed the capability of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to disrupt RNF10/GluN2A complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>)."

                                "text": "RNF10 is a member of the Ring Finger Protein family, which has been generally implicated in development, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, DNA repair and oncogenesis (<a href=\"#bib46\">Saurin et al., 1996</a>). However, the neuronal function of RNF10 is still unknown (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Malik et al., 2013</a>). To understand the role of RNF10 in neurons, we silenced RNF10 expression by using a short hairpin (sh) RNF10 knock-down or a scramble sequence (as control) in primary hippocampal cultures. We tested three different sequences of RNF10 shRNA (shRNF10; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods); shRNF10 that led to the highest level of RNF10 downregulation (&gt;90%; TRCN0000041128) was selected and used in all experiments. Confocal imaging of hippocampal neurons transfected with shRNF10 or scramble plasmids demonstrated a significant effect of RNF10 knock-down on dendritic spine morphology (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013E</a>). In particular, RNF10 silencing produced a significant reduction in dendritic spine density (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) without any effect on dendritic spine length (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) or dendritic spine head width (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). For a more detailed morphological analysis, dendritic spines were categorized according to their shape (mushroom, thin and stubby) using a validated classification method (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bourne and Harris, 2008</a>). However, no effect of shRNF10 in the proportion of dendritic spine subtypes was observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Notably, the effect of RNF10 silencing on dendritic spine density was fully rescued by co-expressing a wild-type human variant of RNF10 resistant to shRNA (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods; flag-RNF10; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013E</a>). Interestingly, overexpression of RNF10 per se had no effect on dendritic spine morphology (data not shown). We then verified whether the loss of spines following RNF10 protein knock-down was correlated with an altered expression of the main components of the excitatory synapse. To this end, we infected primary hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, left panels) and organotypic hippocampal slices (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, right panels) with pLKO-shRNF10 lentivirus or scramble sequence as a control. As expected, RNF10 silencing produced a significant reduction of RNF10 protein level compared to dissociated neurons and slices treated with scramble construct (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Most importantly, RNF10 silencing resulted in a significant decrease of GluN2A, PSD-95 and the GluA1 subunit of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) protein levels in the total cell homogenate of pLKO-shRNF10-infected dissociated neurons and organotypic slices (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>)."

To validate this hypothesis, we assessed whether the modulation of neuronal activity affects the subcellular localization of RNF10 and its association with the interacting proteins. We first enhanced synaptic excitatory activity with the GABA-A receptor antagonist Bicuculline (50\u2009\u03bcM) in the presence of the K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker 4-AP (2.5\u2009mM; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hardingham et al., 2002</a>) ('Bic' treatment). Enhanced excitatory activity significantly decreased RNF10 immunoreactivity along dendrites as compared to untreated neurons, without affecting PSD-95 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) labeling and induced a significant increase in RNF10 nuclear staining (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, left panels). This effect was not correlated to an alteration of RNF10 total protein amount as determined by WB analysis performed with neuronal lysates (data not shown; +7.8% \u00b1 8.6%, cLTP vs. control; p&gt;0.05, n=6). To further confirm that RNF10 accumulates in the nucleus following long-distance protein transport, we performed time-lapse confocal imaging of RNF10 fused to photoconvertible tdEOS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). We photoconverted RNF10-tdEOS in distal dendrites from green-to-red emission using 405 nm irradiation immediately after Bic treatment and tracked the red fluorescence signal over 90 min. Bic treatment induced a significant increase in RNF10-tdEOS photoconverted fluorescence intensity in the nucleus compared to untreated neurons accompanied by a decline in distal dendrites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>)."

Similarly, Bic dependent increase in RNF10 nuclear staining was reduced by the co-incubation with the NMDAR blocker MK801 (data not shown). Moreover, hippocampal neurons (<i>DIV14</i>) were treated with Bicuculline (50\u2009\u03bcM) and 4-AP (2.5\u2009mM) in presence of the GluN2B antagonist ifenprodil (5 \u00b5M), corresponding to a well-validated protocol to obtain a specific activation of synaptic NMDARs (Syn; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, left panel; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hardingham et al., 2002</a>). Synaptic NMDARs stimulation induced a significant increase in RNF10 nuclear accumulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, left panels).

This increase was abolished in the presence of the GluN2B antagonist ifenprodil (5 \u00b5M), but not with GluN2A antagonist NVP-AAM077 (50 nM) indicating that Jacob dissociates from the synapses following activation of GluN2B but not di-heteromeric GluN2A containing NMDAR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>)."

According to this scheme, importins function as adapter molecules by binding NLS-bearing proteins. Components of the classical nuclear import machinery are present at synapses in association with NMDARs and importins translocate to the nucleus in response to NMDAR stimulation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Thompson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jeffrey et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Marfori et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ch'ng et al., 2012</a>). Analysis of the RNF10 sequence showed the presence of two putative NLS motifs (NLS1: aa 591\u2013599; NLS2: aa 784\u2013791; <a href=\"#bib47\">Seki et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Marfori et al., 2011</a>). We therefore investigated the neuronal localization of RNF10 by transfection of RNF10 FL and RNF10 truncated mutants lacking one [Myc-RNF10 (1\u2013611)] or both NLS motifs [Myc-RNF10 (1\u2013590)] in primary hippocampal neurons. Myc-RNF10 FL showed an intense nuclear accumulation (as the endogenous protein; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). However, both truncated mutants failed to localize to the nucleus as indicated by a very low co-localization with the nuclear marker Dapi (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In particular, also the longest Myc-RNF10 (1\u2013611) construct lacking only the C-terminal NLS2 domain accumulated in the cell soma but did not show a marked nuclear localization (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), thus suggesting that the second NLS2 motif could be responsible for RNF10 nuclear translocation in neurons. Notably, the overexpression of Myc-RNF10 (1\u2013611) construct produced a significant reduction in the density of PSD-95-positive puncta along dendrites (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, upper panels) similar to that observed following RNF10 silencing (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, lower panels), indicating that this protein fragment can act in a dominant negative manner."

We next asked whether RNF10 translocates to the nucleus from distal dendrites following induction of LTP in mature hippocampal neuronal cultures. For induction of LTP we used two established protocols (<a href=\"#bib13\">Deisseroth et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Otmakhov et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Oh et al., 2006</a>).

The rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration upon LTP-inducing stimuli was verified by Fluo-4-AM fluorescence (data not shown). We photoconverted RNF10-tdEOS in distal dendrites (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) and tracked the red fluorescence signal over time.

This emphasizes that the synaptodendritic but not the somatic pool of RNF10 largely contributes to its nuclear transport upon LTP-inducing stimuli.

Taking this into account, we induced cLTP in the presence of an exogenously added RNF10 NLS2 peptide, thus competing with endogenous RNF10/importin binding. RNF10 NLS2 peptide is mostly composed of basic residues having a very high similarity with the most common cell-permeable peptides (CPPs) such as the TAT peptide (<a href=\"#bib16\">Farkhani et al., 2014</a>). However, before the evaluation of the effect of NL2 peptide on RNF10 subcellular distribution, we first verified the ability of this peptide to act as a CPP, that\u00a0is, that it can cross the plasma membrane and enter neurons. As shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, we detected TideFluor<sup>TM</sup>-tagged TAT and NLS2 peptides into neurons to a similar extent, thus indicating the capability of the NLS2 peptide to work as a CPP. Notably, NLS2 peptide induced a significant reduction of RNF10/importin \u03b11 interaction when compared to treatment with TAT (used as control peptide; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). The NLS2 peptide completely prevented the LTP-dependent increase in nuclear RNF10, as indicated by immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D</a>) and by immunoblot analyses of RNF10 protein levels in a P1 crude nuclear fraction (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G,H</a>). Importantly, treatment with NLS2 peptide also prevented the decrease in dendritic RNF10 labeling observed after induction of cLTP (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E,F</a>). Overall, these results further confirm that NLS2-dependent binding to importin represents a key step for RNF10 trafficking to the nucleus."

Up-regulation of p21<sup>WAF1/cip1</sup> was significantly attenuated by co-treatment with the NMDAR blocker MK801 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013C</a>). Similarly, stimulation of synaptic NMDARs induced an increase in p21<sup>WAF1/cip1</sup> that was blocked by bath application of MK801 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). Notably, the increase in p21<sup>WAF1/cip1</sup> protein levels following stimulation of synaptic NMDARs was completely prevented by RNF10 silencing (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>), indicating that modulation of p21<sup>WAF1/cip1</sup> expression is RNF10-dependent. In addition, the same effect on p21<sup>WAF1/cip1</sup> levels was observed following induction of cLTP. Again, the increased expression of p21<sup>WAF1/cip1</sup> was prevented by RNF10 silencing (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10F</a>).

To this end, we overexpressed or silenced RNF10 in hippocampal neurons (<i>DIV7</i>) followed by induction of cLTP (<i>DIV14</i>). As expected, cLTP increased significantly PSD-95 cluster width in control neurons (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11F,G</a>).

Among others, RNF10 and CaM share the same GluN2A binding region (aa 991\u20131029; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bajaj et al., 2014</a>). Our results indicate a preferential formation of RNF10/GluN2A complex in resting conditions that is disrupted in favor of CaM/GluN2A complex following\u00a0synaptic activity-dependent calcium influx. Overall, our data show that RNF10 binding to GluN2A plays a key role for RNF10 anchoring at the excitatory synapse but also interfere with the formation of CaM/NMDAR complex. Moreover, the presence of RNF10 in close proximity to the receptor channel allows for a rapid calcium-dependent dissociation of RNF10/GluN2A complex following NMDAR activation and for the subsequent formation of RNF10/importin complex."

                        "text": "Here, we show that interaction of RNF10 with importin\u00a0\u03b11 represents a key step for its nuclear translocation. However, we also describe that RNF10 can interact with the majority of importin\u00a0\u03b1 isoforms including the importin\u00a0\u03b15 previously described to be associated with the NMDAR complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jeffrey et al., 2009</a>). Taken together, these findings suggest that synaptonuclear trafficking of RNF10 is involved in the control of gene expression, which is necessary for LTP-type synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. Very few studies are available addressing the role of RNF10 in the CNS, and they mainly address its association with the transcription factor Meox2, which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib47\">Seki et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hoshikawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Malik et al., 2013</a>). A very recent study performed in P19 carcinoma cell line and in mouse cerebellar granule cells suggests that RNF10 acts as a positive regulator of neuronal differentiation, as its knockdown reduced the number of cells expressing early and late neuronal markers (<a href=\"#bib31\">Malik et al., 2013</a>). Notably, microarray, subsequent real-time PCR and western blotting analysis allowed us to find, among others, novel RNF10 target genes known to be involved in the regulation of the excitatory synapse function and morphology (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vogt et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Michaluk et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bagni et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ramakers et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pavlowsky et al., 2012</a>). RNF10 silencing induced a dramatic up-regulation of MMP9 expression and a concomitant reduction of Arhgef6, ArhGap4 and Ophn1 levels. Intriguingly, all these genes are mutated or dysregulated in intellectual disability syndromes in humans and/or in the corresponding mouse models (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vogt et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Michaluk et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ramakers et al., 2012</a>), which are characterized by various alterations in dendritic spines, thus suggesting a key role in synaptic effects observed following RNF10 silencing. In this view, modulation of RNF10 expression in hippocampal neurons demonstrated its relevant role in regulating dendritic spine morphology under resting conditions as well as following activity-dependent plasticity. In particular, RNF10 silencing leads to a significant decrease in spine density that is fully rescued by co-transfection of shRNA-resistant RNF10 construct. As a direct consequence of this dramatic morphological event, we also observe a concomitant reduction in the expression of proteins almost exclusively localized at the excitatory PSD, such as PSD-95, AMPARs GluA1 subunit and NMDARs GluN2A subunit. Notably, overexpression of the RNF10(1\u2013611) construct unable to translocate to nucleus leads to a significant reduction in PSD-95 positive puncta along dendrites. This result strongly indicates that an impaired RNF10-mediated synaptonuclear signaling and not a reduction of RNF10 synaptic levels is responsible for the reduction of dendritic spine density observed following RNF10 silencing."

                        "text": "The present and other studies indicate that NMDAR complex is likely a very rich source of protein messengers that are capable of trafficking to the nucleus. Most important, the present study provides convincing evidence that different NMDAR signals will indeed induce the nuclear import of different messengers. Several reports have documented that NMDARs activation leads to a differential modulation of nuclear gene expression, depending upon their localization (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hardingham and Bading, 2010</a>). In general, activation of synaptic NMDARs promotes the expression of synaptic plasticity-related genes, whereas activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs has been correlated to CNS pathological conditions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hardingham and Bading, 2010</a>). The protein messenger Jacob, following long-distance transport and nuclear import, can encode and transduce the synaptic and extrasynaptic origin of GluN2B NMDAR signals to the nucleus and might dock a NMDA-receptor-derived signalosome to nuclear target sites in a stimulus-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib27\">Karpova et al., 2013</a>). Notably, here we show that activation of synaptic but not extrasynaptic NMDARs leads to an increase in RNF10 nuclear localization. Similarly to what was previously described for Jacob (<a href=\"#bib5\">Behnisch et al., 2011</a>), we observe that RNF10 moves to the nucleus after induction of LTP but not LTD, modulating the expression of Meox2 target genes. However, in contrast to Jacob, inhibition of GluN2A- but not GluN2B-containing NMDARs is sufficient to block RNF10 trafficking to the nucleus, its interaction with the transcription factor Meox2 and the expression of the Meox2 target gene p21<sup>WAF1/cip1</sup>. Another intriguing finding includes the observation that the transcription factor CREB2 also known as ATF4 transits to the nucleus only after induction of NMDAR-dependent cLTD but not cLTP (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lai et al., 2008</a>). Transcriptional regulators at synaptic sites like CRTC1 can also be phosphorylated by synaptic signals in a complex manner and translocation of CRTC1 to the nucleus might link specific types of stimuli to specific changes in gene expression."

In this context, RNF10 represents a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger responsible for long-lasting re-shaping of dendritic spines as observed after specific synaptic stimuli and required for postsynaptic modifications needed to convey LTP induction."

Primary and secondary antibodies were applied in 5% BSA in PBS-C.M. Cells were chosen randomly for quantification from different coverslips. Fluorescence images were acquired by using Zeiss Confocal LSM510 Meta system with a sequential acquisition setting at 1024x1024 pixels resolution; for each image two up to four 0.5\u03bcm sections were acquired and a z projection was obtained (<a href=\"#bib32\">Malinverno et al., 2010</a>). All images were acquired standing the signals within the linear range in order to perform a reliable quantification (avoiding the presence of any saturated pixel) and to compare appropriately all experimental conditions. For analysis of dendritic spine morphology, primary hippocampal neurons were transfected with GFP-containing constructs at <i>DIV7</i>. Cells were fixed and immunolabeled for GFP at <i>DIV14</i>. The SP5 CLSM system (Leica-Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) equipped with Diode (405\u00a0nm), Argon (488\u00a0nm) and Diode Pumped Solid State (561\u00a0nm) lasers was used for time-lapse imaging of RNF10 fused to tdEOS. Images were taken with HCX APO L20x/1.00W objective (Leica, Germany). Along the z-axis at list 10 optical sections with focus depth of 300\u2013400 nm were taken in order to cover the complete volume of imaged neurons. Quick change 18\u2009mm Chamber with Field Stimulation (RC-49MFS, Warner Instruments) was used for mounting coverslips with living overexpressing RFN10-tdEOS neurons in Neurobasal medium (Gibco) on the microscope stage. Master-8/U 8-channel programmable pulse generator (Science Products) was used to generate timing and two channels were synchronized to produce complex patterns of pulses (1\u00a0ms pulse duration) with inter pulse interval of 20 ms. To eliminate the distortion and thereby to achieve a rectangular pulse permitting accurate measurement, the constant-current stimulus isolation unit (SIU-102, Warner Instruments) was used in the output of a stimulus generator. The LTP was induced by applying current pulses 18s@50\u00a0Hz via field stimulation electrode. Response of cultured hippocampal neurons on field synaptic stimulation was verified by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging with Fluo-4-AM (1\u00a0\u00b5M) (data not shown)."

D5671; 2\u2009mM Glutamine; 100 units/ml penicillin and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Sigma); 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Immunological Sciences, Milano, Italy). For overexpression of RNF10, the day after plating the cells were transfected with 3\u03bcg pL-shRNF10 or pGIPZ-scr and with 2.5\u2009\u03bcg psPAX2 and 0.75\u2009\u03bcg pMD2.G retroviral packaging constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) in 7\u2009ml of complete medium. For RNF10 silencing, the cells were transfected with 3\u2009\u03bcg pLV-RNF10-EGFP, and with 2\u2009\u03bcg pMDLg/pRRE, 0.75\u2009\u03bcg pRSV-REV, 11\u2009\u03bcg pMD2.G lentiviral packaging constructs. 48\u2009hr after transfection culture medium was collected, filtered through 0.45\u2009\u03bcm PVDF filter and precipitated with polyethylene glycol (PEG; 5x PEG solution contained: 200\u2009g PEG, Sigma Cat. 89510, 12\u2009g NaCl in 2\u2009mM Tris pH 7.5) overnight. Precipitates were then collected by centrifugation at 1500 xg for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, resuspended in cold HEPES balanced salt solution (HBSS, Sigma), aliquoted and snap frozen. Aliquots were kept at -80\u00b0C. Each viral batch was tittered by serial dilution infections of rat hippocampal primary cells by means of real-time PCR (for RNF10 silencing) using primers for rat RNF10 (to evaluate efficacy of downregulation): forward 5\u2019-GAACAAGAGACAGGGCAGGT, reverse 5\u2019-GACAGAGGGGTCAGCAGAAA. For experiments, a viral titer was used yielding &gt; 80% of RNF10 downregulation. Virus for overexpression was tittered by FACS, and a titer yielding &gt; 80% EGFP positive cells was used."

Briefly, the GluN2A(839\u20131461) C-tail (bait) was cloned in the pGBKT7 plasmid and transformed in the AH109 haploid yeast strain (MATa). This was mated overnight with the Mouse Brain normalized library (prays) cloned in pGADT7 transformed in Y187 haploid yeast strain (MAT\u03b1). Yeast were plated after 24 on selective plate, allowing only the growth of diploid where a protein interaction between the bait and pray protein occurred (absence of Leucine, Adenine, Tryptophan and Histidine). Then the diploid where tested by a colorimetric assay (\u03b1-gal) to avoid the presence of false positive. Plasmids (21 positive clones) were extracted from the yeast and sequenced. Five genes were identified following sequencing, one of those being RNF10."

In support of this idea, the authors show that RNF10 is present at synaptic sites and directly interacts with GluN2A. RNF10 knockdown induces reductions in spine density and some synaptic proteins. Activation of synaptic NMDARs induces synaptonuclear translocation of RNF10 through NLS2-dependent interactions with importin \u03b1 proteins. In addition, LTP-inducing stimuli also induce synaptonuclear RNF10 translocation, leading to the interaction of RNF10 and a transcriptional regulator Meox2, and regulation of the expression of RNF10 target genes."

It is especially remarkable that RNF10 knockdown not only reduces spine density but also total GluN2A, GluA1, and PSD-95 protein levels. In the future, it seems worthwhile to explore regulation of the transcription of these proteins by RNF10 in more detail. Also notable is the contrast between RNF10 and Jacob, another synaptonuclear shuttle protein as discovered earlier by some of the authors, which associates with GluN2B rather than GluN2A, with RNF10 shuttling induced by activation of GluN2A- and not GluN2B-containing NMDARs whereas Jacob shuttling requires the opposite. Contrasting the differential behaviors of those two proteins is an especially nice aspect of this manuscript."

Firstly, we have prepared novel GST-GluN2A fusion proteins to identify more precisely the GluN2A domain involved in the interaction with RNF10. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> we found that GluN2A(991-1049) is needed for the binding to RNF10. This GluN2A intracellular domain contains the GluN2A(991-1029) domain that has been recently identified as an atypical high affinity calcium/calmodulin binding site (Bajaj G, et al., 2014, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 444: 588-94). Notably, the formation of GluN2A/calmodulin complex was strictly dependent to the presence of calcium. In agreement with these results, here we show by in vitro pull-down assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E-G</a>) and co-IP from transfected COS-7 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>) that incubation with calcium/calmodulin leads to a complete disruption of the GluN2A/RNF10 complex. Overall, these new experiments indicate the existence of a competition between RNF10 and calmodulin for the binding to GluN2A that can take place following NMDA receptor activation and consequent calcium influx."
