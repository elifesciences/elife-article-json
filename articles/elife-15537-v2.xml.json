A crystal structure of the mariner transposase Mos1 (derived from <i>Drosophila mauritiana</i>), in complex with transposon ends covalently joined to target DNA, portrays the transposition machinery after DNA integration. It reveals severe distortion of target DNA and flipping of the target adenines into extra-helical positions. Fluorescence experiments confirm dynamic base flipping in solution. Transposase residues W159, R186, F187 and K190 stabilise the target DNA distortions and are required for efficient transposon integration and transposition in vitro. Transposase recognises the flipped target adenines via base-specific interactions with backbone atoms, offering a molecular basis for TA target sequence selection. Our results will provide a template for re-designing mariner/Tc1 transposases with modified target specificities."

A crystal structure of the mariner transposase Mos1 (derived from <i>Drosophila mauritiana</i>), in complex with transposon ends covalently joined to target DNA, portrays the transposition machinery after DNA integration. It reveals severe distortion of target DNA and flipping of the target adenines into extra-helical positions. Fluorescence experiments confirm dynamic base flipping in solution. Transposase residues W159, R186, F187 and K190 stabilise the target DNA distortions and are required for efficient transposon integration and transposition in vitro. Transposase recognises the flipped target adenines via base-specific interactions with backbone atoms, offering a molecular basis for TA target sequence selection. Our results will provide a template for re-designing mariner/Tc1 transposases with modified target specificities."

This causes two DNA bases in the surrounding DNA to flip out from their normal position in the DNA molecule, which enables them to be recognised by the transposase. Further experiments showed that this base-flipping is dynamic, that is, the two bases continuously flip in and out of position. Furthermore, Morris et al. identified which parts of the transposase enzyme are required for the transposon to be efficiently pasted into the genome."

Invading transposons can alter genes, affect gene expression or spread drug resistance in bacteria. As shuffling of DNA by transposition can be deleterious, transposons often become inactivated or transcriptionally silenced. Conversely, transposons can give rise to new, useful cell functions. For example, domestication of a Transib-type DNA transposon led to V(D)J recombination and adaptive immunity in jawed vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2005</a>). Similarly, the Cas1 integrase component of prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems of adaptive immunity originated from DNA transposons named Casposons (<a href=\"#bib22\">Krupovic et al., 2014</a>). Integration of spacer sequences into the CRISPR locus by the Cas1-Cas2 complex has similarities with transposon and retroviral DNA integration (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015</a>)."

Many DNA transposases (e.g. Mos1, Tn5 and bacteriophage MuA) share a conserved RNase H-like catalytic domain, along with retroviral integrases (e.g. HIV-1) and RAG recombinases. These DDE/D enzymes use common active site chemistry to perform similar DNA cleavage and DNA integration reactions. By contrast, there is wide diversity in their preferred target integration sites. Most DDE/D recombinases show only limited preference for a consensus target DNA sequence, which is usually palindromic (<a href=\"#bib13\">Goryshin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Halling and Kleckner, 1982</a>). The number of base pairs separating the integration sites on complementary DNA strands also varies, from 2 to 9. Some retroviral integrases (e.g. prototype foamy virus (PFV) and HIV-1) preferentially insert their viral genome into nucleosomal DNA (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pruss et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Maskell et al., 2015</a>). Similarly, some transposases (e.g. Tn10) favour bent target DNA structures (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pribil and Haniford, 2003</a>). In other transposition systems (e.g. IS<i>21,</i> Mu), an element-encoded accessory ATPase facilitates strand transfer (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mizuno et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arias-Palomo and Berger, 2015</a>); and can prevent self-destructive insertion of the transposon into its own sequence (target immunity), (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mizuno et al., 2013</a>).

They are widespread in nature and are used as tools for genome engineering and therapeutic applications. For example, the reconstructed Tc1 transposase Sleeping Beauty (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ivics et al., 1997</a>) is being used in human clinical trials to treat B-cell lymphoma by genetic engineering of T cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Maiti et al., 2013</a>) and in pre-clinical studies to reduce age-related macular degeneration (<a href=\"#bib18\">Johnen et al., 2012</a>).

The ability to pre-select specific sites for integration, beyond the requisite TA, may be desirable for certain genome engineering applications, e.g. controlled genomic integration of a therapeutic gene. Such targeted transposition has been achieved for the bacterial transposase ISY100 using a C-terminal Zif268 DNA-binding domain fusion (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feng et al., 2010</a>); and for Sleeping Beauty transposase either by fusing it with a targeting domain (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yant et al., 2007</a>) or by exploiting interactions with a targeting protein (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ivics et al., 2007</a>).

The <i>trans</i> architecture of the PEC regulates coordinated excision of the transposon ends (<a href=\"#bib38\">Richardson et al., 2009</a>) and cross-talk between transposase sub-units (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bouuaert et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dornan et al., 2015</a>). After excision, the Mos1 transpososome locates a TA target integration site (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pflieger et al., 2014</a>) and, upon binding, forms a target capture complex (TCC) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>).

In this snapshot of the transposition machinery after DNA transposon integration, the target DNA is distorted from B-form and the target adenines are flipped into extra-helical positions. Base-flipping is confirmed in solution by time-resolved fluorescence of strand transfer complexes in which the target adenines are substituted by 2-aminopurine. Adenine-specific interactions, between the flipped adenine bases and transposase backbone atoms, provide a molecular basis for recognition of the TA target sequence. Interactions with Mos1 transposase residues W159, R186, F187 and K190, which are essential for transposon integration\u00a0in vitro, stabilise distortions in the target DNA. Conservation of key residues involved in stabilising the target DNA distortions suggests this mechanism may also occur with other <i>mariner/Tc1</i> family transposons."

There is also clear density for the nucleobase of T<sub>0</sub> on strand b (magenta) in active site B. However, we observed no clear density for the T<sub>0</sub> base on strand t (active site A), indicating some disorder in its position. Therefore this nucleotide was built as abasic. In active site B the T<sub>0</sub> nucleobase \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacks with the base of C<sub>-1</sub> to which T<sub>0</sub> would have been connected before strand transfer. The T<sub>0</sub> base is unpaired and O4 is 3.4\u2009\u00c5 from the H122 imidazole NH, suggesting a possible base-specific hydrogen bond (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>).

In duplex DNA the exponential decay of 2AP fluorescence is typically described by four lifetime components, each reporting on different quenching environments that 2AP experiences as a result of the conformational dynamics of the duplex. The lifetime indicates the degree of quenching (stacking) in a particular conformation and the corresponding A\u2013factor indicates the fractional occupancy of that conformation. The shortest lifetime (\u03c4<sub>1</sub> \u2245 50 ps) is due to a highly stacked conformation, which typically accounts for &gt;70% of the population. The longest lifetime (\u03c4<sub>4</sub> \u2245 9\u201310 ns) corresponds to an unstacked conformation in which 2AP is extra-helical and solvent-exposed; this conformation is typically &lt;5% of the population. The intermediate lifetimes (\u03c4<sub>2</sub> \u2245 500 ps and \u03c4<sub>3</sub>\u2245 2 ns) are due to conformations in which 2AP is intra-helical but imperfectly or partially stacked."

In the absence of transposase, 90% of the 2AP population of TP13 has the shortest lifetime (\u03c4<sub>1</sub>=30ps), indicating a tightly stacked duplex structure. Upon addition of Mos1 transposase, the decay parameters are essentially unchanged showing that the local duplex structure is unaffected, confirming the steady-state fluorescence results. TP1 fluorescence decay, in the absence of protein, is also dominated by the shortest lifetime, stacked component (76%, \u03c4<sub>1</sub>= 50 ps, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>), with only 6% of the population in the unstacked state (\u03c4<sub>4</sub> =\u00a07.5 ns). (The differences in the decay parameters between TP13 and TP1 are consistent with a less tightly stacked environment in the latter, where 2AP is unpaired). However, upon addition of transposase to TP1, the decay parameters change markedly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). Most notably, there is a large transfer of population from the highly stacked state (\u03c4<sub>1</sub> = 80 ps) to the unstacked, unquenched state (\u03c4<sub>4</sub> 9.7 ns); the population of the former falls to 38% and that of the latter increases concomitantly to 31%. This clearly confirms that, in solution, 2AP at the position of the target adenine A<sub>1</sub> in the Mos1 STC experiences base-flipping into an extra-helical environment. Moreover, flipping of this 2AP is dynamic: a number of conformational states are sampled, including base-flipped and base-stacked environments."

Studies by Pflieger <i>et al.</i> suggested that target DNA also bends before Mos1 strand transfer (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pflieger et al., 2014</a>). Comparison of the Mos1 STC structure with our previous TCC model (containing straight target DNA) and both the <i>pre</i>- and <i>post</i>-TS cleavage PECs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dornan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Richardson et al., 2009</a>) supports this conclusion. Our previous TCC model (<a href=\"#bib38\">Richardson et al., 2009</a>) of straight B-form target DNA binding highlighted clashes with some transposase loop residues, indicating conformational changes in the target DNA and/or the transposase would be required for target capture. The similar architectures and interactions of the IR DNA and transposase in the STC and both PEC structures (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) suggest that target DNA is likely deformed.

The severe target DNA bend (~147\u00b0) observed in our Mos1 STC structure is similar to the ~140\u00b0 target DNA distortion in the bacterial MuA transpososome, which was proposed to drive the isoenergetic strand transfer reaction forward (<a href=\"#bib30\">Monta\u00f1o et al., 2012</a>). Mu employs a helper protein (MuB) in its transposition, which may facilitate target DNA bending by forming helical filaments on DNA, prior to capture by the MuA transpososome (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mizuno et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, the bacterial insertion sequence IS<i>21</i> requires IstB for efficient transposition. In the presence of ATP, IstB self-assembles into decamers that can bend ~50 bp DNA by 180\u00b0 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arias-Palomo and Berger, 2015</a>). In the PFV integrase target capture and strand transfer complexes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maertens et al., 2010</a>) naked target DNA is bent by 55\u00b0. Nucleosomal DNA is peeled from the histone octamer and similarly deformed by interactions with the PFV intasome, providing a structural basis for retroviral integration at nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Maskell et al., 2015</a>). By contrast, recent evidence indicates that <i>mariner/Tc1</i> transposons preferentially integrate at linker regions between nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gogol-D\u00f6ring et al., 2016</a>). Our results provide a structural basis for this preference: severe target DNA bending (~147\u00b0) by the transpososome can be more easily achieved on flexible linker DNA than on DNA tightly engaged with the histone octamer in a nucleosome structure."

The X-ray diffraction data were processed with iMosflm, scaled and merged with AIMLESS and the statistics are shown in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>. Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement, using our structure of the Mos1 PEC (PDB ID: 3HOS, chains A to F, comprising the transposase dimer and two cleaved IR DNA molecules) as the search model in PHASER. The difference electron density after molecular replacement is shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The remaining structure was built manually. Restrained refinement was performed with Refmac and Coot and included automatic non-crystallographic symmetry restraints on the protein and DNA chains.

Transposable elements make up a large proportion of most genomes, and their movement from place to place generates genome diversity and contributes to genome instability. This work addresses how Mos1 insertion into new sites in DNA is faithfully achieved. A crystal structure of Mos1 transposase complexed to transposon ends covalently joined to target DNA reveals severe distortion of target DNA and flipping of the target adenines into extra-helical positions. The molecular recognition by transposase of these flipped residues provides a molecular basis for target site selection. Transposase residues that stabilise the DNA distortion are required for efficient transposition."

This difference electron density (before any model building) should be shown (at the very least as a supplementary figure) as it is crucial for everything in the paper-this should be explicitly shown. Furthermore, as the resolution is moderate, possible model bias is a concern. The reviewer believes that the electron densities shown are inappropriate, as they are the 2Fo-Fc kind, and therefore subject of the modeling assumptions. In the reviewer's opinion, all the electron density figures should be replaced with simulated annealed omit maps (easily and rapidly computed with the freely available Phenix suite of programs). Considering the similarities of the STC to the previously published PEC structures it is hard to imagine that target DNA would bend <i>after</i> strand transfer. Would a straight target DNA fit between active sites of the Mos1 transpososome?"

Do substantive insights emerge after carefully examining the structural changes alluded to below? For example, there may be a missed opportunity to compare the current structure with 4U7B, that is a pre-NTS-cleavage state (Dornan et al., 2015, NAR 43, 2424). I think readers would be interested in how the protein conformation has changed to accommodate what is now the target strand. While I understand that visualization of conformational changes using static images is hard to do well, I can imagine that a morphing movie could be informative. This can be easily done in these days, as a variety of tools are available to accomplish this. I think it would be good to point out for the less initiated that the NTS used is the authentic product of the first cleavage. It would be also good to define the T<sub>0</sub> phosphate as the scissile phosphate (which I believe it is)."

Mos1 is a eukaryotic transposon and has to deal with nucleosomes in some way, and recent evidence indicates that Tc1/mariner transposition avoids nucleosomes (see PubMed-ID 26755332). This ties up beautifully with the current data: a 150\u00b0 kink would be incompatible with nucleosomal structure. Indeed, even in the case of PFV intasome, which induces a 60\u00b0 bend in target DNA, engagement of a nucleosome requires peeling of the DNA from the histone octamer (Maskell et al., 2015). The last sentences of the Discussion are rather contrived and weak; something more insightful could be stated, or perhaps deleted [they do nothing to enhance the otherwise excellent presentation]."

For example, there may be a missed opportunity to compare the current structure with 4U7B, that is a pre-NTS-cleavage state (Dornan et al., 2015, NAR 43, 2424). I think readers would be interested in how the protein conformation has changed to accommodate what is now the target strand. While I understand that visualization of conformational changes using static images is hard to do well, I can imagine that a morphing movie could be informative. This can be easily done in these days, as a variety of tools are available to accomplish this.</i>"

Changes in the transposase structure are subtle and involve movement of the catalytic domains towards each other and the target DNA.

This ties up beautifully with the current data: a 150\u00b0 kink would be incompatible with nucleosomal structure. Indeed, even in the case of PFV intasome, which induces a 60\u00b0 bend in target DNA, engagement of a nucleosome requires peeling of the DNA from the histone octamer (Maskell et al., 2015).</i>"
