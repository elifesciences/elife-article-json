We found that <i>Yap</i>, a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, is specifically expressed in these stem cells. <i>Yap</i> knock-down leads to an accelerated S-phase and an abnormal progression of DNA replication, a phenotype likely mediated by upregulation of <i>c-Myc</i>. This is associated with an increased occurrence of DNA damage and eventually p53-p21 pathway-mediated cell death. Finally, we identified PKNOX1, a transcription factor involved in the maintenance of genomic stability, as a functional and physical interactant of YAP. Altogether, we propose that YAP is required in adult retinal stem cells to regulate the temporal firing of replication origins and quality control of replicated DNA. Our data reinforce the view that specific mechanisms dedicated to S-phase control are at work in stem cells to protect them from genomic instability."

We found that <i>Yap</i>, a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, is specifically expressed in these stem cells. <i>Yap</i> knock-down leads to an accelerated S-phase and an abnormal progression of DNA replication, a phenotype likely mediated by upregulation of <i>c-Myc</i>. This is associated with an increased occurrence of DNA damage and eventually p53-p21 pathway-mediated cell death. Finally, we identified PKNOX1, a transcription factor involved in the maintenance of genomic stability, as a functional and physical interactant of YAP. Altogether, we propose that YAP is required in adult retinal stem cells to regulate the temporal firing of replication origins and quality control of replicated DNA. Our data reinforce the view that specific mechanisms dedicated to S-phase control are at work in stem cells to protect them from genomic instability."

Understanding the biology of these cells is of the utmost importance for developing new treatments for a wide range of human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Before a stem cell divides, it copies its DNA and the two sets of genetic instructions are then separated so that the two daughter cells both have a complete set. This process needs to be as accurate as possible because any errors would result in incorrect genetic information being passed on to the daughter cells."

In the fish or amphibian retina, a continuously proliferating peripheral domain called ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wetts et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Perron et al., 1998</a>) was recently formally demonstrated to contain genuine multipotent and self-renewing neural stem cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Centanin et al., 2011</a>). The CMZ not only ensures cell replacement, but also contributes to life-long growth of the eye through the permanent generation of all retinal cell types. The CMZ thus represents an ideal model for dissecting molecular cues underlying retinal stem cell properties in vivo. Such knowledge is essential for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies based on the mobilization and targeted activation of endogenous neural stem cells for tissue repair."

YAP function in adult stem cells, however, remains unclear. For instance, <i>Yap</i> overexpression increases self-renewal of airway basal stem cells (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhao et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, it surprisingly leads to a loss of intestinal stem cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barry et al., 2013</a>), while being seemingly neutral regarding the quantity and function of hematopoietic stem cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jansson and Larsson, 2012</a>). Inactivation studies further suggested that YAP is largely dispensable in a physiological context for the homeostasis of several adult organs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Azzolin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>), although this might reflect in some cases functional redundancy with the other Hippo effector TAZ (<a href=\"#bib24\">Imajo et al., 2015</a>). YAP is implicated in tissue regeneration but its effects are controversial (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barry et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the role of YAP in vertebrate adult stem cells may likely be context-dependent and clearly deserves further investigation. Since its function in adult neural stem cells is presently unknown, we took advantage of the <i>Xenopus</i> CMZ model system and investigated whether <i>Yap</i> is involved in the maintenance of an active pool of retinal stem cells in the continuously growing post-embryonic frog eye. Although YAP gain of function led quite expectedly to CMZ cell overproliferation, the loss of function analysis revealed a more complex phenotype. Indeed, we found that stem cells were still present but exhibited aberrant cell cycle progression. In particular, DNA replication timing was found to be altered leading to a dramatic S-phase shortening. This correlates with increased DNA damage and eventually cell death. We also found that YAP functionally and physically interacts with PKNOX1, a transcription factor required to maintain genomic stability (<a href=\"#bib26\">Iotti et al., 2011</a>)."

In line with this, we found that in the post-embryonic retina, <i>Yap</i> is expressed in the most peripheral stem cell-containing region of the CMZ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). We also performed immunostaining using an antibody whose specificity was assessed in a loss of function context, that is, in tadpoles injected with <i>Yap</i> Morpholinos (<i>Yap</i>-MO; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for efficiency and specificity evaluation of <i>Yap</i>-MO). YAP protein was detected in stem cells located at the tip of the CMZ, mainly in the cytoplasm, although some signal could be observed as well in the nuclei of these cells. Of note, we also found YAP labeling in M\u00fcller glial cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To delineate more precisely the <i>Yap</i> expression domain, we co-labeled <i>Yap</i> and proliferative cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). A short EdU pulse was performed allowing slow dividing stem cells to be distinguished from fast proliferating transit amplifying progenitors in the CMZ (<a href=\"#bib58\">Xue and Harris, 2011</a>). <i>Yap</i> staining was found to be prominent in EdU-negative stem cells and in the most peripheral EdU-positive cells (young progenitors). The staining then waned in more central older progenitor cells. Of note, in contrast to <i>Yap</i>, <i>Taz</i> is faintly expressed in the post-embryonic retina and only a weak and diffuse signal could be detected in the CMZ (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

Conditional <i>Yap</i> knockdown by light exposure from stage 33/34 or even from stage 37/38 onwards is sufficient to reduce eye size, suggesting that <i>Yap</i> is required at post-embryonic stages to maintain CMZ-dependent eye growth.

The same was true when <i>Yap</i> knockdown was conditionally induced from late embryogenesis (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The difference in EdU-labeling between control and <i>Yap</i> morphant tadpoles was even more pronounced at the tip of the CMZ where stem cells reside and <i>Yap</i> expression is the strongest (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We thus reasoned that <i>Yap</i> knockdown might decrease the number of proliferative cells in the CMZ as a consequence of stem cell depletion. Using in situ hybridization, we examined the expression of several retinal stem and progenitor cell markers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and data not shown). Surprisingly, stainings observed in <i>Yap</i>-MO-injected tadpoles were similar to control ones, indicating that both stem and progenitor cell populations were still present. Accordingly, neither the total number of cells within the CMZ nor the size of the proliferative cell population (PCNA labeled) was significantly affected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013J</a>). Together, these data indicate that <i>Yap</i> knockdown does not induce stem/progenitor cell exhaustion but rather alters the relative proportion of time these cells spend in S-phase of the cell cycle."

As a first global approach to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the mitotic index in the whole post-embryonic CMZ using the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 (PH3; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). We found that compared to the control, <i>Yap</i> knockdown results in a significantly lower percentage of mitotic cells per section, which is suggestive of a longer total cell cycle length. To further investigate cell cycle progression defects at the level of the whole CMZ, we then measured G2 length using the percentage of labeled mitosis (PLM) paradigm (<a href=\"#bib43\">Quastler and Sherman, 1959</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cai et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Locker et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a>). As expected from the asynchrony among retinal cells in the CMZ, the percentage of PH3/EdU-labeled cells increased sigmoidally with increasing EdU exposure times, before reaching a plateau (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Noticeably, the PLM was consistently lower at each time point in <i>Yap</i> morphant retinas compared to control ones, indicating a delayed S- to M-phase progression. We estimated that the mean G2 length (T<sub>G2</sub>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details) doubled in <i>Yap</i> morphant retinas compared to the control (from approximately 2.5 to 4.5 hr).

This may account, at least in part, for the S-phase length shortening. To strengthen this hypothesis, we examined EdU-labeled replication foci at the tip of the CMZ. Their abundance and distribution, as classically observed in synchronized cultured cells, are indeed known to differ between early (numerous small foci located throughout the nucleus) and mid/late S-phase (limited number of large foci; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib53\">van Dierendonck et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Koberna et al., 2005</a>). In the control situation, we found both early and late patterns within the stem cell population of the CMZ. In contrast, the proportion of cells in mid/late S-phase was dramatically reduced in <i>Yap</i> morphant cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Altogether, these data highlight that loss of YAP function in retinal stem cells alters their temporal program of DNA replication and points to <i>c</i>-<i>Myc</i> as a potential actor in this process. Interestingly, a similar phenotype (decrease in late replication patterns and <i>c</i>-<i>Myc</i> up-regulation) was also observed in the ventricular zone of the neural tube where <i>Yap</i> is expressed, suggesting that YAP function in S-phase progression may also hold true in other neural precursor cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a>)."

Among them, only <i>p53</i> and <i>p21</i><sup><i>Cip1/WAF1</i></sup> (previously named <i>Xic2</i> in <i>Xenopus</i> and <i>p21</i> hereafter) were significantly affected, with much higher levels present in <i>Yap</i> morphant retinas compared to control ones (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). The tumor suppressor protein <i>p53</i> is activated in response to a variety of cellular stresses (including DNA damage) and triggers cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that its expression in the wild type retina is restricted to the CMZ. In addition and consistent with the NanoString data, <i>p53</i> staining was strongly enhanced in the CMZ of <i>Yap</i>-MO-injected tadpoles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). Of note, an up-regulation was observed in the neural tube as well (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). p21 is a member of the CIP/KIP family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that blocks the G1-S transition and has emerged as a key player in the p53 pathway (<a href=\"#bib4\">Attardi and DePinho, 2004</a>). Since it was previously described as a lens-specific marker in the <i>Xenopus</i> eye (<a href=\"#bib16\">Daniels et al., 2004</a>), we asked if it could be linked with the observed CMZ phenotype. We thus performed in situ hybridization and observed a strong ectopic <i>p21</i> labeling within the CMZ of <i>Yap</i> morphant tadpoles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). As a whole, these results suggest that increased apoptosis and probably delayed cell cycle progression resulting from <i>Yap</i> knockdown might be driven by the p53-p21 pathway."

However, its physical interaction with YAP has not yet been reported in vertebrates. We found that the two proteins indeed interact in vitro using a two-hybrid assay (data not shown).

In this purpose, constructs encoding YAP, PKNOX1 or TEAD1 (as a positive control for interaction with YAP) fused to either the amino or carboxyl-terminal fragment of the VENUS fluorescent protein were transfected in HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> and data not shown for inverse VN/VC fusion combinations).

A loss of function approach was first undertaken to compare <i>Yap</i> and <i>pknox1</i> knockdown phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013G</a>). The injected dose of <i>pknox1</i>-MO was adapted to avoid broad developmental defects (see <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for validation of <i>pknox1</i>-MO specificity and efficiency). Although the eye phenotype appeared more dramatic than that observed upon <i>Yap</i> knockdown (layering defects of the retina), it similarly led to a significant reduction in total eye size (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,C</a>), associated with decreased EdU incorporation in the CMZ compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G,H</a>). In addition, analysis of EdU-labeled replication foci revealed a decreased proportion of stem cells in mid/late S-phase (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013E</a>) in <i>pknox1</i> morphant, as observed following <i>Yap</i> knockdown. These embryos also displayed upregulation of <i>c</i>-<i>Myc</i> expression in the CMZ, thus recapitulating main features of the <i>Yap</i> knockdown phenotype (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). We then asked whether YAP and PKNOX1 might synergize in a co-overexpression assay. Of note, <i>pknox1</i> overexpression alone does not significantly affect CMZ cell proliferation. The injected dose of <i>Yap</i> mRNA was lowered so that it only leads to a moderate although significant increase in the number of EdU-labeled cells. In these conditions, <i>pknox1</i> mRNA injection was found to exacerbate <i>Yap</i> gain of function phenotype (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9I,J</a>). Finally, we tested whether <i>pknox1</i> knockdown might rescue the overproliferative effects of <i>Yap</i> misexpression. We found indeed that EdU incorporation was restored to a basal level in a <i>pknox1</i> morphant context (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9K,L</a>).

Our knowledge regarding the molecular basis sustaining somatic stemness features is still very limited but may have important implications for regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. In the present study, we identified YAP, a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, as a stem cell specific marker required for homeostatic growth of the frog post-embryonic retina. Our in vivo loss of function approach unexpectedly revealed a novel role for YAP in governing DNA replication timing of retinal stem cells. We propose a model in which this function would contribute to the maintenance of their genomic stability (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Importantly, based on our findings in the neural tube, we propose that such function might be generalizable to other neural precursor populations. Whether this involves YAP cytoplasmic and/or nuclear activity remains an open question."

However, the mechanisms underlying altered cell proliferation (changes in cell cycle length and/or re-entry) are rarely investigated in detail. In the developing neural tube for instance, YAP-driven increase in neural progenitor cell number has been proposed to result from accelerated cell cycle progression but whether its loss of function alters cell cycle kinetics as well remains an open question (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). As observed in other adult organs in mammals (<a href=\"#bib5\">Azzolin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>), our results suggest that YAP is dispensable for the maintenance of the stem cell pool. We instead uncovered that its depletion lengthens retinal stem cell divisions. However, to our surprise, this is associated with a dramatic shortening of their S-phase. It should be emphasized that such phenotype likely corresponds to a hypomorphic one due to the use of Morpholinos that allows partial loss of function. DNA replication is a tightly regulated process that follows a strict temporal program. Our observation that <i>Yap</i> knockdown results in a mark reduction of late S-phase labeling patterns can suggest that some firing origins have advanced their activation timing, which may account for the reduced S-phase duration. The genetic control of DNA replication temporal progression has not been elucidated yet and there are thus very few examples in the literature where gene perturbation leads to a deregulation of S-phase duration (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aparicio, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yamazaki et al., 2013</a>). Beyond its well-characterized transcriptional activity, it was reported that c-Myc exerts a non-transcriptional control on DNA replication. Its overexpression indeed causes increased replication origin activity and consequent S-phase shortening (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dominguez-Sola et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Robinson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Srinivasan et al., 2013</a>). Intriguingly, in contrast to <i>Drosophila</i> or cancer cells, where <i>c</i>-<i>Myc</i> has been reported to be positively regulated by <i>Yap</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Neto-Silva et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stocker, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Xiao et al., 2013</a>), we found that its expression is enhanced in the CMZ of <i>Yap</i> morphant tadpoles. Although the underlying mechanism deserves further investigation, this raises the hypothesis that <i>c</i>-<i>Myc</i> may contribute to the S-phase defects caused by <i>Yap</i> knockdown. Besides, in addition to be involved in replication progression, we do not exclude that YAP may also regulate replication origin licencing in G1, as recently reported in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shen and Stanger, 2015</a>). This might explain the observed lengthening of the cell cycle as a result of impaired G1/S transition. Alternatively, delayed G-phase progression might occur as a secondary consequence of S-phase defects."

Since p21 is known to inhibit G1/S and G2/M transitions and p53 to induce programmed cell death (<a href=\"#bib54\">Vogelstein et al., 2000</a>), this could contribute to both the lengthening in G phases and the increased number of apoptotic cells."

In addition to unique properties (such as the ability to self renew), emerging evidence suggests that somatic stem cells also differ from progenitor cells in the way they regulate basic cellular processes including their metabolic state (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burgess et al., 2014</a>) or DNA-damage responses (<a href=\"#bib25\">Insinga et al., 2014</a>). Regarding cell cycle progression, it has been shown during development that mammalian cortical neural stem cells exhibit a substantially longer S-phase than progenitors committed to neuron production (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Turrero Garc\u00eda et al., 2015</a>). It was thus proposed that neural stem cells may need to invest more time during S-phase into quality control of replicated DNA. In agreement with this, we also found that CMZ retinal stem cells exhibit a longer S-phase compared to fast amplifying progenitors (data not shown). In addition, our work points for the first time towards a factor, YAP, that may be critically involved in this stem cell specific regulation of S-phase. Although its precise function in this process remains to be investigated, it indeed appears to be required for proper choreography of the DNA replication program and may as such be necessary to maintain genomic integrity of retinal stem cells."

Interestingly, another component of the Hippo pathway, LATS1, has very recently been involved in ATR-mediated response to replication stress in lung cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pefani et al., 2014</a>).

Here, we provide biochemical and functional evidences supporting an interaction between PKNOX1 and YAP in the retina. PKNOX1 belongs to the TALE (three amino acids loop extension) class of homeodomain proteins and is involved in many developmental processes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berthelsen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ferretti et al., 2006</a>). Down-regulation of <i>pknox1</i> in both zebrafish and mouse embryos leads to a small eye phenotype (<a href=\"#bib17\">Deflorian et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ferretti et al., 2006</a>), reminiscent of what we found in <i>Xenopus</i>. Interestingly, <i>pknox1</i> inactivation was reported to trigger cell death in the zebrafish CNS (<a href=\"#bib17\">Deflorian et al., 2004</a>). Furthermore, <i>pknox1</i> deficiency leads to increased DNA damage and apoptosis both in embryonic fibroblasts and in the mouse epiblast (<a href=\"#bib32\">Micali et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fernandez-Diaz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Iotti et al., 2011</a>). On the basis of these different reports and our findings, we thus propose that PKNOX1 and YAP interact together to maintain genomic stability in retinal stem cells. Whether PKNOX1 functions in competition with TEAD for YAP interaction or whether they all associate in a tripartite complex are important questions to be addressed in the future."

The mean labeling index (LI) per retina was then plotted as a function of time after EdU injection. LI increases linearly until it reaches a plateau (T<sub>plateau</sub>) allowing determining the growth fraction (GF; proportion of cycling cells within the considered population). The best-fit line was drawn using the Excel spreadsheet provided by R Nowakowski (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nowakowski et al., 1989</a>). It allows estimating T<sub>c</sub> and T<sub>S</sub> using the two following equations: T<sub>plateau</sub> = T<sub>c</sub> \u2212 T<sub>s</sub>; LI<sub>0</sub> = GF \u00d7 (T<sub>s</sub>/T<sub>c</sub>) (LI<sub>0</sub> being the extrapolated y intercept of the best-fit line). Mitotic index and percentages of EdU-labeled mitosis were measured as previously described (<a href=\"#bib31\">Locker et al., 2006</a>). The time required for half-maximal appearance of EdU labeling in the mitotic population was taken as an estimation of the mean G2 length (T<sub>G2</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arai et al., 2011</a>)."

The authors showed that <i>Yap</i> loss results in elevated <i>c-Myc</i> expression, dramatically shortened S-phase with slower cell cycle progression, p53 induction and cell death. The accelerated S-phase is associated with a shift towards an \u201cearly\u201d S-phase labeling patterns, increased DNA damage and death. Using morpholino knockdowns, fluorescence complementation analysis, overexpression and pull down assays they provide evidence for interaction of PKNOX1 with YAP. The reviewers were very impressed by the elegant approaches used, the high quality of the data throughout the manuscript, and the inclusion of many critical controls."

The knock down phenotype suggests that the cell cycle is extended by about 10hrs, which is the result of slowing down G2 by about 2h, shortening S-phase by about 13h, and assuming no change in M-phase, lengthening G1 by about 20h. Clearly the major affect is on G1 and S. It isn't very clear, why, if YAP-MO cells are rushing through S, why they also seem to hang up in G1. Perhaps cells that have made mistakes in the previous S have trouble in the G1-S transition. The reviewers felt there may be a clue to this in looking at what is happening in the overexpression/overactivity (overgrowth) phenotype. If YAP is affecting both of these phases of the cell cycle independently, then one would expect to see YAP overactivity both shorten G1 and lengthen S, but if the MO phenotype is primarily on S (inhibiting replication fork firing) then overactivity should slow down S but not affect G1 so much. The overactivity phenotype may also suppress <i>c-myc</i>, but this is problematic as <i>c-myc</i> is pro-proliferative. As there may be an antagonism <i>n-myc</i> and <i>c-myc</i> in this system, perhaps YAP-MO cells are biased to <i>c-myc</i> while YAP-overactive cells are biased to <i>n-myc</i>. A focused analysis on the cell cycle kinetics of the CMZ cells with a pulse of YAP should be considered."

The knock down phenotype suggests that the cell cycle is extended by about 10hrs, which is the result of slowing down G2 by about 2h, shortening S-phase by about 13h, and assuming no change in M-phase, lengthening G1 by about 20h. Clearly the major affect is on G1 and S. It isn't very clear, why, if YAP-MO cells are rushing through S, why they also seem to hang up in G1. Perhaps cells that have made mistakes in the previous S have trouble in the G1-S transition. The reviewers felt there may be a clue to this in looking at what is happening in the overexpression/overactivity (overgrowth) phenotype. If YAP is affecting both of these phases of the cell cycle independently, then one would expect to see YAP overactivity both shorten G1 and lengthen S, but if the MO phenotype is primarily on S (inhibiting replication fork firing) then overactivity should slow down S but not affect G1 so much. The overactivity phenotype may also suppress</i> c-myc<i>, but this is problematic as</i> c-myc <i>is pro-proliferative. As there may be an antagonism</i> n-myc <i>and</i> c-myc <i>in this system, perhaps YAP-MO cells are biased to</i> c-myc <i>while YAP-overactive cells are biased to</i> n-myc<i>. A focused analysis on the cell cycle kinetics of the CMZ cells with a pulse of YAP should be considered.</i>"
