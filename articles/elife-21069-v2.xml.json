The Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes are the main microtubule binding components of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> kinetochore. Cooperation between these two complexes enhances kinetochore-microtubule coupling and is regulated by Aurora B kinase. We show that the Ndc80 complex can simultaneously bind and bridge across two Dam1 complex rings through a tripartite interaction, each component of which is regulated by Aurora B kinase. Mutations in any one of the Ndc80p interaction regions abrogates the Ndc80 complex\u2019s ability to bind two Dam1 rings in vitro, and results in kinetochore biorientation and microtubule attachment defects in vivo. We also show that an extra-long Ndc80 complex, engineered to space the two Dam1 rings further apart, does not support growth. Taken together, our work suggests that each kinetochore in vivo contains two Dam1 rings and that proper spacing between the rings is vital."

The Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes are the main microtubule binding components of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> kinetochore. Cooperation between these two complexes enhances kinetochore-microtubule coupling and is regulated by Aurora B kinase. We show that the Ndc80 complex can simultaneously bind and bridge across two Dam1 complex rings through a tripartite interaction, each component of which is regulated by Aurora B kinase. Mutations in any one of the Ndc80p interaction regions abrogates the Ndc80 complex\u2019s ability to bind two Dam1 rings in vitro, and results in kinetochore biorientation and microtubule attachment defects in vivo. We also show that an extra-long Ndc80 complex, engineered to space the two Dam1 rings further apart, does not support growth. Taken together, our work suggests that each kinetochore in vivo contains two Dam1 rings and that proper spacing between the rings is vital."

The Dam1 complex forms a ring around microtubules, while the Ndc80 complex forms a long flexible rod that can bend in the middle. However, it was not clear how these shapes allow these complexes to perform their roles in cells."

The presence of two Dam1 rings at the kinetochore, in a specific orientation bound to the Ndc80 complex, would have implications for how attachment strength is established and modulated by tension."

The full decameric Dam1 complex and tetrameric Ndc80 complex were cross-linked in the presence of taxol-stabilized microtubules. The C-terminal regions of Dam1p, Ask1p, and Spc34p formed cross-links to three distinct regions of Ndc80p (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The corresponding regions of Nuf2p also formed cross-links to these same regions of the Dam1 complex (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These three C-terminal regions of the Dam1 complex include five sites phosphorylated by Aurora B kinase. Phosphorylation of all five sites fully disrupts the interaction between the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lampert et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tien et al., 2010</a>). Thus, these sites likely represent primary interaction sites through which the Dam1 complex binds the Ndc80 complex."

Importantly, Ndc80 complexes carrying a mutation in regions A<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, B<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, or C<sup>Ndc80p</sup> demonstrated homogeneous behavior in size exclusion chromatography, similar to the wild type Ndc80 complex (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>). These mutations also did not alter the residence time of the Ndc80 complex alone on microtubules, consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tien et al., 2013</a>). As reported previously, the presence of the Dam1 complex significantly increases the residence time of wild-type Ndc80 complex on microtubules (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tien et al., 2010</a>). However, addition of the Dam1 complex only partially increased the residence time of the mutant complexes as compared to the wild-type Ndc80 complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). Ndc80-GFP complex containing Ndc80p insertional mutations outside the regions A<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, B<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, and C<sup>Ndc80p</sup> had similar microtubule and Dam1 complex binding characteristics as the wild-type Ndc80 complex (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>). These observations suggest regions A<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, B<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, and C<sup>Ndc80p</sup> each contribute to the interaction of Ndc80 complex with Dam1 complex; and the insertional mutants in these three regions were previously identified as lethal because they disrupted the interaction between the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes."

Phosphorylation of Dam1p S20 significantly decreases Dam1 complex oligomerization, while phosphorylation of the three C-terminal sites in Dam1p slightly inhibits direct binding of the Dam1 complex to microtubules (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gestaut et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zelter et al., 2015</a>). In our prior work, we showed that phosphorylating all five sites besides S20 fully disrupts interaction between the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tien et al., 2010</a>).

In the absence of the Ndc80 complex, the Dam1 complex rings tended to bind in doublets of rings, at an inter-ring distance of 13.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4 nm (avg \u00b1 s.d.)

The stacked double-ring organization may be analogous to the paired ring helices previously reported to form at higher concentrations of Dam1 complex (<a href=\"#bib39\">Miranda et al., 2005</a>). The percent of Dam1 ring pairs found in closely spaced doublets was higher in the presence of the Ndc80 complex, 49.1% (estimated by Gaussian fitting to the peak, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), as compared to without the Ndc80 complex, 18.8%.

In particular, our observations raise the question of whether the specific 33 nm inter-ring distance, delimited by the Ndc80 complex, is important. To test this we constructed yeast expression plasmids for <i>ndc80<sup>10-hep</sup></i> and <i>nuf2<sup>10-hep</sup>,</i> encoding Ndc80p and Nuf2p each with 10-heptad repeats inserted. Using a plasmid shuffle assay, we found that even when introduced together, <i>ndc80<sup>10hep</sup></i> and <i>nuf2<sup>10hep</sup></i> could not support growth, even though the encoded proteins were expressed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>).

The only known difference is that the inter-ring distance is increased by 9 nm.

To determine if these Ndc80p mutants confer defects in chromosome biorientation and attachment, we used an auxin-inducible degron system for degrading the wild-type Ndc80-AID (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nishimura et al., 2009</a>). Non-degradable wild-type or mutant <i>NDC80</i> was integrated at the <i>URA3</i> locus. Ndc80-AID was efficiently degraded in the presence of auxin (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Budding index analyses revealed that cells carrying wild-type <i>NDC80</i> progressed through mitosis as expected. Cells without <i>NDC80</i> also budded and divided on schedule, despite major defects in kinetochore attachment (see below), as expected since activation of the SAC requires the Ndc80 complex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dou et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hiruma et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ji et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, cells carrying Ndc80p mutations in regions A<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, B<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, and C<sup>Ndc80p</sup> arrested as large-budded cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) suggesting defects in kinetochore attachment and indicating that the checkpoint remained functional."

Cultures were synchronized at G1, released from synchrony and then imaged after 60 min. In the majority of wild-type <i>NDC80</i> cells, CEN3 was bioriented with both CEN3-GFP puncta on the spindle axis; 78% were in metaphase and 22% were in anaphase as judged by the spindle length. In the majority of the Ndc80<i>-</i>depleted cells, CEN3-GFP was off of the spindle axis, consistent with complete detachment. A mutation in region A<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, B<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, or C<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, resulted in 61, 59, and 75% of the cells with monooriented CEN3 and 34, 39, and 21% of cells with detached CEN3, respectively.

In addition, in the majority of cells depleted of Ndc80 or with a mutation in regions A<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, B<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, or C<sup>Ndc80p</sup> the SPBs were separated by more than 2 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These long spindles and the high frequency of detached CEN3 suggest that few if any of the kinetochores were bioriented. Thus, we conclude that Ndc80p carrying a mutation in region A<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, B<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, or C<sup>Ndc80p</sup> disrupts kinetochore biorientation and attachment in vivo."

Rings are not required for the Dam1 complex to track depolymerizing microtubules in the absence of tension (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gestaut et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Grishchuk et al., 2008</a>). However, oligomerization of the Dam1 complex is required to maintain attachments under tension as would be experienced during metaphase (<a href=\"#bib54\">Umbreit et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Volkov et al., 2013</a>). Prior models of the kinetochore have all assumed that each kinetochore contains only one Dam1 complex ring. Here we show that the Ndc80 complex bridges two rings of the Dam1 complex in vitro. Lethal mutations in Ndc80p that block binding of either one of the two rings result in loss of the Dam1 complex from the kinetochore and failure in biorientation and attachment of kinetochores to the mitotic spindle. These results suggest that faithful microtubule attachments require two Dam1 complex rings per kinetochore in vivo."

Our results indicate that the interaction between the Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes is more extensive forming a tripartite network. The C-terminal domains of Dam1p, Ask1p, and Spc34p interact with three distinct regions of Ndc80p, one of which is the hairpin consistent with the previous report (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lampert et al., 2013</a>). Our results are also consistent with a previous study showing an interaction between Ndc80p and the C-terminal region of Dam1p (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kalantzaki et al., 2015</a>).

The addition of extra heptad repeats in the coiled-coil domains might destabilize formation of the heterotetrameric Ndc80 complex, for example. However, we do not currently favor this hypothesis because the extra-long mutant version of Ndc80p is expressed in vivo, and because the Ndc80<sup>10hep</sup> complex is stable and binds to both microtubules and to the Dam1 complex in vitro, similar to wild-type Ndc80 complex. Unnatural orientation of the Ndc80p/Nuf2p globular head in the Ndc80<sup>10hep</sup> complex, due to the addition of extra heptad repeats, might also disrupt the specific geometry that the Ndc80 complex takes in relation to other kinetochore proteins. However given the presence of the flexible loop in Ndc80p, it seems unlikely that the two ends of the complex are held in a rigid orientation relative to each other. Compared to the wild-type Ndc80 complex, the Ndc80<sup>10hep</sup> complex further separates the Dam1 complex rings in vitro. We propose that the specific 33 nm Dam1 complex inter-ring distance is vital. The transition from 13 nm, in the absence of the Ndc80 complex, to 33 nm Dam1 complex inter-ring distance could signal the establishment of kinetochore-microtubule attachment or biorientation. Deviation from the specific 33 nm distance might disrupt a yet unknown mechanism for detecting kinetochore-microtubule attachments, or bioriented attachments, or both. Future work will focus on characterizing the specific effects of the extra-long Ndc80 complex and the role of the Dam1 complex inter-ring distance in vivo."

Taxol-stabilized, Alexa-647-labelled microtubules were then flowed in and incubated for 5 min for immobilization. For all TIRF microscopy experiments, Ndc80-GFP complex was incubated at 50 pM for single-molecule imaging. Each phosphorylated or mock-treated Dam1 complex mutant construct was incubated at 2.5 nM. GFP and Alexa-647 fluorescence channels were simultaneously recorded using a custom TIRF imaging system (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gestaut et al., 2010</a>).

The two experiments identified similar interaction regions between the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes. XL-MS was performed as described in <a href=\"#bib61\">Zelter et al. (2015)</a>. Briefly, 10 \u00b5g of taxol stabilized microtubules were mixed with 10 \u00b5g Dam1 complex and 10 ug Ndc80 complex in 100 \u00b5L BRB80 at 25\u00b0C and allowed to stand for 5 mins. For DSS cross-linking, 3 \u00b5L 14.5 mM DSS in DMSO was added, and the mixture allowed to cross-link for 2 mins at 25\u00b0C before quenching by addition of 10 \u00b5L 0.5 M NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. For EDC cross-linking 7.5 \u00b5L 145 mM EDC plus 3.75 \u00b5L 145 mM Sulfo-NHS were added to the reaction, and the mixture allowed to cross-link for 30 mins at 25\u00b0C before quenching by addition of 10 \u00b5L 0.5 M NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. Quenched reactions were spun at 58,000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 100 \u00b5L ice cold buffer reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min followed by 30 mins alkylation at RT with 15 mM iodoacetamide (IAA). Digestion with trypsin at a substrate to enzyme ratio of 60:1 was performed overnight at room temperature with shaking. Digested samples were acidified with 5 M HCL prior to being stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. Mass spectrometry and data analysis was performed on either a Q-Exactive or Q-Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) as previously described (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zelter et al., 2015</a>). Each cross-linked sample was run four times and the data were combined before analysis (technical replicate). Mass spectra were converted into mzML using msconvert from ProteoWizard (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chambers et al., 2012</a>). Standard linear peptide searches were performed using Comet to identify all proteins in the sample (<a href=\"#bib13\">Eng et al., 2013</a>). Cross-linked peptides were identified using the Kojak version 1.4.2 cross-link identification software (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hoopmann et al., 2015</a>) following the author\u2019s instructions (<a href=\"http://www.kojak-ms.org\">http://www.kojak-ms.org</a>). Kojak results were exported to Percolator version 2.08 (<a href=\"#bib28\">K\u00e4ll et al., 2007</a>) to produce a statistically validated set of cross-linked peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) at the desired false discovery rate (FDR) threshold. Percolator (RRID: <a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005040\">SCR_005040</a>) is a semi-supervised algorithm that assigns a statistically meaningful q value to each PSM through analysis of the target and decoy PSM distributions. Decoy PSMs derive from peptide sequences known to be false. In the current work the target databases consisted of all proteins identified in the sample analyzed, while the decoy databases consisted of the corresponding set of reversed protein sequences. Cross-link PSMs were considered to be false if at least one of the peptides was from a decoy protein sequence. The data presented in this paper was filtered to show only hits to the target proteins that had a Percolator assigned peptide level q value\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05. The complete, unfiltered list of all PSMs and their Percolator assigned q values, are available on the ProXL web application (<a href=\"#bib47\">Riffle et al., 2016</a>) at: <a href=\"http://proxl.yeastrc.org/proxl/viewProject.do?project_id=24\">http://proxl.yeastrc.org/proxl/viewProject.do?project_id=24</a> along with the raw MS spectra and search parameters used."

This interaction had been studied in quite some detail before, but the authors add an important new twist to the story by proposing that Ndc80 binds two Dam1 rings, rather than one as previously believed. The manuscript reports a nice mechanistic investigation that sheds new light on an important piece of molecular machinery. The <i>S. cerevisiae</i> kinetochore remains central for the advancement of kinetochore studies, and the dissection of its mechanism of action is of general interest for the field. While the reviewers are supportive, they also identified some contentious points that will need to be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript."
