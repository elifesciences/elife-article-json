Insects detect volatile molecules using olfactory (OR) or ionotropic receptors (IR) and in some cases gustatory receptors (GRs). While IRs are expressed in olfactory organs across Protostomia, ORs have been hypothesized to be an adaptation to a terrestrial insect lifestyle. We investigated the olfactory system of the primary wingless bristletail <i>Lepismachilis y-signata</i> (Archaeognatha), the firebrat <i>Thermobia domestica</i> (Zygentoma) and the neopteran leaf insect <i>Phyllium siccifolium</i> (Phasmatodea). ORs and the olfactory coreceptor (Orco) are with very high probability lacking in <i>Lepismachilis</i>; in <i>Thermobia</i> we have identified three Orco candidates, and in <i>Phyllium</i> a fully developed OR/Orco-based system. We suggest that ORs did not arise as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle, but evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco being present before the appearance of ORs."

Insects detect volatile molecules using olfactory (OR) or ionotropic receptors (IR) and in some cases gustatory receptors (GRs). While IRs are expressed in olfactory organs across Protostomia, ORs have been hypothesized to be an adaptation to a terrestrial insect lifestyle. We investigated the olfactory system of the primary wingless bristletail <i>Lepismachilis y-signata</i> (Archaeognatha), the firebrat <i>Thermobia domestica</i> (Zygentoma) and the neopteran leaf insect <i>Phyllium siccifolium</i> (Phasmatodea). ORs and the olfactory coreceptor (Orco) are with very high probability lacking in <i>Lepismachilis</i>; in <i>Thermobia</i> we have identified three Orco candidates, and in <i>Phyllium</i> a fully developed OR/Orco-based system. We suggest that ORs did not arise as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle, but evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco being present before the appearance of ORs."

The sensitivity and chemical range of animal olfactory systems is remarkable, enabling animals to detect and discriminate between thousands of different odor molecules. Although there is a striking evolutionary convergence towards a conserved organization of signaling pathways in vertebrate and invertebrate olfactory systems (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hildebrand and Shepherd, 1997</a>), the involved receptor gene families evolved independently. The molecular identity of olfactory receptors was first unraveled in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buck and Axel, 1991</a>). In mammals, as many as 1000 heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (or G protein)-coupled receptors are considered to be employed in olfactory discrimination (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buck and Axel, 1991</a>).

The identity of receptors involved in olfaction in the evolutionarily more ancient apterygote insects (Archaeognatha, Zygentoma) and paleopteran insects (Odonata and Ephemeroptera) is thus completely unknown. In neopteran insects (Polyneoptera, Paraneoptera, and Holometabola) most volatile stimuli are recognized by members of the olfactory receptor family (ORs). ORs are multitransmembrane domain proteins unrelated to nematode or vertebrate olfactory receptors (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mombaerts, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Robertson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hill et al., 2002</a>), displaying a distinct membrane topology (<a href=\"#bib6a\">Benton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lundin et al., 2007</a>).

The transition from sea to land meant that molecules needed to be detected in gas phase instead of aquatic solution. Therefore, the olfactory system of a hexapod ancestor had to adapt to the terrestrial conditions and detection of volatile, air-borne chemicals. One proposed hypothesis has been that Orco and ORs of the insect type are an adaptation to this terrestrial lifestyle (<a href=\"#bib46\">Robertson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kr\u00e5ng et al., 2012</a>). To reconstruct an evolutionary scenario for insect ORs, we investigated species belonging to different ancient insect orders, including Archaeognatha (jumping bristletails) and Zygentoma (silverfishes and firebrats), and a neopteran insect belonging to the Phasmatodea (leaf and stick insects) as so far not analyzed control group using morphological, electrophysiological and molecular techniques."

These sensilla were arranged in a pattern that is highly stereotypical between antennal modules composed of 5\u201312 annuli, with annuli typically containing zero-to-four <i>Sensilla basiconica</i> (<a href=\"#bib37\">Missbach et al., 2011</a>). Responses to all tested chemical classes of odors, including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, and ketones, were recorded from OSNs housed in these sensilla using the single sensillum recoding measurements (SSR) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, uppermost heat map). Based on the response profile, spontaneous activity, and colocalization inside the same sensillum, we identified 12 OSN types, present in five functional basiconic sensillum types. Out of the 12 OSN types, only seven responded to odors tested; two exclusively to acids, while five responded with a similar activity rate to acids or amines and to other odors. OSNs belonging to this second class were broadly tuned and exhibited relatively low spiking activity. In general, OSN classes displayed a low baseline activity with about 1 to 7 spikes/s, with Lys-ab2A that had a spontaneous activity of more than 25 spikes/s as the only exception. Only rarely was an increase in spiking rate of more than 60 spikes per second recorded, even for the best identified ligands (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). No responses were obtained for ammonia or pyridine. Coeloconic-like sensilla, s-shaped trichoid sensilla, and chaetic sensilla did not display any morphological features indicating olfactory function and did also not respond to any odor tested (<a href=\"#bib37\">Missbach et al., 2011</a>; data not shown). In conclusion, 7 OSN types that were all housed in basiconic sensilla responded to a wide spectrum of odor molecules."

The proximal part of the antennae is not only covered with sensilla, but also scales. Glands (g) are highly abundant on the antennae. Many mechanosensory sensilla (S.ch.: Sensilla chaetica) were arranged in circles on the antennal segments. On some antennal segments gustatory sensilla (arrows) can be found between the S.ch (for further information read <a href=\"#bib37\">Missbach et al., 2011</a>). Very rarely zero to four olfactory Sensilla basiconica were identified per segment, in a mostly redundant pattern on the antennae with similar numbers of olfactory sensilla and sensilla types on each antennal segment. Antennal segments are separated by antennal breaking points. The pattern of sensilla is modulated by increasing the number of annuli of a segment through molting. (<b>B</b>\u2013<b>E</b>) Different morphological types of basiconic sensilla. No grooved sensilla/olfactory coeloconic sensilla were identified on the antennae. Only small pegs surrounded by a cuticular wall (s. coe.; referred as coeloconica-like sensillum, <a href=\"#bib7a\">Bockhorst 1988</a>) were located on the antennae.

In comparison to the wingless insects, the response repertoire of the leaf insect was much more diverse, with a total of 23 different functional sensillum types as identified by SSR recordings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). No responses were obtained from trichoid sensilla, but since they were only present on the male antennae they could be involved in detection of an unknown volatile pheromone. In all cases, reported detection of volatile pheromones in insects is dependent on very specific ORs. Taken together these data suggest that leaf insects have a much broader response repertoire with a higher number of different OSN types than the more basal species we analyzed; apparently the number of olfactory receptors has increased. It also seems likely that at least the leaf insect makes use of ORs in odorant detection."

MSA analysis of these together with ORs and GRs of various insect species and the <i>Daphnia</i> GRs always confirmed the position of the <i>L. y-signata</i> GR candidates within the GR and not the OR family (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 4</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 5</a>).

Although we could not identify any OR sequences in the transcriptome, a high number of putative glutamate receptor coding contigs was identified (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). However, only five candidate iGluRs and 14 candidate IRs appeared to be real unigenes, possessing at least two of the three transmembrane domains. Some candidate sequences were extended in 3\u2019-direction using RACE-PCR with antennal cDNA as template, allowing verification of unigene status and antennal expression. In MSA and phylogenetic analysis, the identified IRs grouped with DmelIRs (<a href=\"#bib13\">Croset et al., 2010</a>). Among the identified putative LsigIRs were orthologues of the <i>D. melanogaster</i> coreceptors IR25a and IR8a, as well as one receptor similar to IR76b (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD9-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD11-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 4</a>, <a href=\"#SD12-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 5</a>). As in other IRs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Benton et al., 2009</a>) one or several key amino acids in the predicted glutamate binding domains were absent in the non-coreceptor IR candidates and LsigIR76b (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). 7 out of 14 LsigIRs group close to a cluster of <i>D. pulex</i> IRs and the antennal IRs IR21a and IR68a of <i>D. melanogaster</i>, with no clear relationship to one or the other. None of the <i>Lepismachilis</i> IR candidates grouped with the \u2018divergent\u2019 <i>Drosophila</i> IRs."

Based on our transcriptome data sets, we suggest a stepwise evolution of the Orco/OR complex with Orco having evolved in the lineage of Dicondylia (Zygentoma + Pterygota) and the functional complex of Orco and ORs emerging within the pterygote insects (this study, <a href=\"#bib10\">Clyne et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gao and Chess, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Smadja et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vosshall et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Robertson and Wanner, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kirkness et al., 2010</a>). Although it is impossible to completely rule out the presence of ORs, none of our extensive experiments led to the identification of either ORs or Orco in the bristletail <i>L. y-signata</i>. The well-established conservation of the <i>Orco</i> coding gene through evolution suggests that it is highly unlikely that we missed it. We did, however, identify a number of IRs, including the IR coreceptors IR25a, IR8a, and IR76b in the <i>L. y-signata</i> antennal transcriptome. FISH allowed us to visualize expression of the IR co-receptors in a large number of OSNs associated with basiconic sensilla. Based on these results we propose that the olfactory system of <i>L. y-signata</i> is not based on ORs."

It follows that this organization cannot exist with just one sensillum type present, as is the case in Archaeognatha (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berg and Schmidt, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Missbach et al., 2011</a>) and older hexapod taxa as the Collembola (<a href=\"#bib4\">Altner and Prillinger, 1980</a>). The oldest insect taxon where double-walled sensilla were investigated is Zygentoma, which have both single-walled basiconic sensilla with pores and double-walled sensilla with spoke channels (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berg and Schmidt, 1997</a>). Coeloconic sensilla differ dramatically from the single-walled trichoid and basiconic types in both wall structure and in internal environment. The coeloconic structure has been thought to be a prerequisite for IR function (<a href=\"#bib6\">Benton et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Guo et al., 2014</a>). However, in the Archaeognatha we find that IRs are most likely located in OSNs of Sensilla basiconica.

One additional observation in the bristletail is that many of those neurons have a broad overlap in their response spectra.

At the time when flying insects occurred, the vegetation on earth was rapidly spreading and diversifying. ORs might not only increase the diversity of detected chemicals, but also allow the olfactory system to rapidly assess airborne odors. This is especially important for insects for which stimulus contact is very short and a fast response time is critical (<a href=\"#bib22\">Getahun et al., 2012</a>). The oldest flying insect orders Odonta (dragonflies and damselflies) and Ephemeroptera (mayflies) were traditionally considered to be anosmic, lacking both a glomerular antennal lobe and mushroom body calyces (<a href=\"#bib55\">Strausfeld et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Farris, 2005</a>). Recent studies have shown that at least dragonflies have an aerial sense of smell (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rebora et al., 2012</a>). However the small antennae and the low number of olfactory sensilla will make it even more challenging to identify putative ORs and Orco in antennal transcriptomes. ORs were definitely present in the last common ancestor of \u2018hemi\u2019- and holometabolan insects at least 318\u2013300 million years ago, with <i>Orco</i> present in both groups (this study, <a href=\"#bib32\">Krieger et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pitts et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Smadja et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yang et al. 2012</a>).

Signals were amplified (10x; Syntech Universal AC/DC Probe), sampled (10,667.0. samples/s), and filtered (100\u20133000 Hz with 50/60 Hz suppression) via USB-IDAC connection to a computer (Syntech). Action potentials were extracted as digital spikes from the analog signal according to top\u2013top amplitudes using Syntech Auto Spike 32 software. Neuron activities were recorded for 10 s, starting 2 s before a stimulation period of 0.5 s. Responses of individual neurons were calculated as the increase (or decrease) in the action potential frequency (spikes/s) relative to the pre-stimulus frequency. Sensilla were classified as basiconic, coeloconic, or trichoid based on morphological criteria. Further subdivision of distinct sensillum types was based on response profiles of all the OSNs housed within, independently from their possible olfactory receptor."

By studying antennal transcriptomes of two insect species belonging to different ancient insect orders (Archaeognatha and Zygentoma) and another derived group (Phasmatodea) the authors show that the OR gene family arose later in insect diversification than has been suggested and was preceded by the Orco co-factor gene. The data do not support a previous suggestion that ORs evolved as an adaptation to terrestrialisation. In contrast to the OR family, ionotropic glutamate receptors (IRs), representing a more ancient class of chemosensory receptors, were identified and shown to be expressed in the antennal olfactory sensilla in Archaeognatha. The authors also perform anatomical and electrophysiological analyses, which provides useful novel data on the properties of the olfactory organs of these species. The paper represents a significant contribution to our understanding of insect olfaction with an interesting insight into the evolution of the OR family."

There is a precedent for this: in the mosquito <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, Orco and ORs have been found to be expressed in the proboscis (PMID 16938890).
