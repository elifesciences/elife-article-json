Here we analyze mechanisms to compensate for changes in gene dose that accompanied the evolution of sex chromosomes from autosomes. Using single-copy transgenes integrated throughout the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> genome, we show that expression of all X-linked transgenes is balanced between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. However, proximity of a dosage compensation complex (DCC) binding site (<i>rex</i> site) is neither necessary to repress X-linked transgenes nor sufficient to repress transgenes on autosomes. Thus, X is broadly permissive for dosage compensation, and the DCC acts via a chromosome-wide mechanism to balance transcription between sexes. In contrast, no analogous X-chromosome-wide mechanism balances transcription between X and autosomes: expression of compensated hermaphrodite X-linked transgenes is half that of autosomal transgenes. Furthermore, our results argue against an X-chromosome dosage compensation model contingent upon <i>rex</i>-directed positioning of X relative to the nuclear periphery."

Here we analyze mechanisms to compensate for changes in gene dose that accompanied the evolution of sex chromosomes from autosomes. Using single-copy transgenes integrated throughout the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> genome, we show that expression of all X-linked transgenes is balanced between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. However, proximity of a dosage compensation complex (DCC) binding site (<i>rex</i> site) is neither necessary to repress X-linked transgenes nor sufficient to repress transgenes on autosomes. Thus, X is broadly permissive for dosage compensation, and the DCC acts via a chromosome-wide mechanism to balance transcription between sexes. In contrast, no analogous X-chromosome-wide mechanism balances transcription between X and autosomes: expression of compensated hermaphrodite X-linked transgenes is half that of autosomal transgenes. Furthermore, our results argue against an X-chromosome dosage compensation model contingent upon <i>rex</i>-directed positioning of X relative to the nuclear periphery."

Aneuploidy occurs in most solid tumors and is a major cause of severe developmental defects and spontaneous abortions (<a href=\"#bib66\">Siegel and Amon, 2012</a>). Unlike pathological imbalances in chromosome dose, the disparity in X-chromosome dose between 1X males and 2X females caused by sex-determination mechanisms has evolved to be well tolerated (<a href=\"#bib13\">Charlesworth, 1996</a>). How this tolerance came about remains poorly understood. Of particular relevance is whether chromosome-wide regulatory mechanisms evolved to modulate the relationship between X-chromosome gene dose and gene product. Here we dissect the function and significance of gene regulatory strategies in the nematode <i>C. elegans</i> to achieve two goals: (1) elucidate mechanisms by which the X-chromosome dosage compensation process balances X expression between the sexes; (2) determine whether an X-chromosome-wide regulatory mechanism balances gene expression between X chromosomes and autosomes to facilitate X-chromosome evolution."

For humans, although the X and Y sex chromosomes are genetically distinct, both originated from a single pair of homologous autosomes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Charlesworth, 1996</a>). The differentiation of an autosome pair into two different sex chromosomes was proposed to begin when one homolog acquired a male-determining gene, thereby converting the homologs into a proto-Y and a proto-X (<a href=\"#bib12\">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bachtrog, 2013</a>). As recombination ceased between the proto-Y and proto-X, the proto-Y could accumulate other male beneficial alleles, but the recombination isolation would cause it to degenerate into a gene-poor Y chromosome that did little more than specify male sexual fate. This process would result in males with one Y chromosome and one X chromosome and females with two X chromosomes. In the nematode <i>C. elegans</i>, sex chromosomes also likely arose from a pair of ancestral autosomes through a similar mechanism, but with Y-chromosome degradation progressing until the Y was lost completely (<a href=\"#bib13\">Charlesworth, 1996</a>). The demise of Y as a male-determining chromosome was enabled by the emergence of a different sex-determination mechanism, one that utilized the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes (ploidy) to specify male (1X:2A) vs. hermaphrodite (2X:2A) sexual fates (<a href=\"#bib56\">Nigon, 1951</a>)."

In mammals, the X and Y sex chromosomes were derived from a single pair of homologous autosomes referred to as the ancestral autosomes (green). Before the evolution of sex chromosomes, genes represented by gene A (black) were present on both ancestral autosomes (<span class=\"underline\">AA</span>). During sex chromosome formation, one autosome acquired a dominant male-determining gene (*), thereby converting an ordinary autosome pair into a proto-X (pX) chromosome and a male sex-determining proto-Y (pY) chromosome (step 1). As recombination ceased between the proto-Y and proto-X, and the proto-Y accumulated other male beneficial alleles, the proto-Y degenerated into the present-day gene-poor Y chromosome that specified male fate (step 2). Loss of genes from Y (e.g. gene A) caused genes from the ancestral autosome to be present in only one copy in males instead of two copies on the ancestral autosomal pair. While most mammalian sex chromosomes progressed only through steps 1 and 2, the nematode sex chromosomes were proposed to have evolved by a similar route but then to have undergone an additional step in which Y chromosome degradation progressed until the Y was lost completely (step 3), giving rise to XX hermaphrodites and XO males. Demise of Y was enabled by the emergence of a sex-determining mechanism that utilizes the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes (X:A signal) to determine sex rather than the dominant masculinizing gene that initiated sex-chromosome evolution. (<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>) Predictions for X-chromosome gene expression with and without Ohno's upregulation mechanism (<b>B</b>) Prediction for X-linked gene expression when the dosage compensation mechanism increases expression of X in males, a case not requiring Ohno's hypothesis. If the dose-sensitive gene A were expressed at a level of 1 when present in two copies on the ancestral autosomes, it would be expressed at a level of 0.5 in present-day males with only one copy on the single male X, and at a level of 1.0 in present-day females, which carry one copy on both X chromosomes. If gene A were haploinsufficient, its reduced expression could have deleterious consequences for the male. To compensate for reduced gene expression in males, a dosage compensation mechanism arose to balance X expression between the sexes. <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> increases X-linked gene expression two-fold in males, thereby balancing the level of gene expression with that in present-day females and that in the ancestral species prior to sex-chromosome evolution. (<b>C</b>) Prediction for X-linked gene expression when the dosage compensation mechanism reduces X gene expression in females without an accompanying upregulation mechanism proposed by Ohno. X-chromosome dosage compensation in mammals and <i>C. elegans</i> occurs by mechanisms different from that of Drosophila, even though sex chromosomes may have evolved by a similar route. These species compensate for the imbalance in X-chromosome dose between the sexes by reducing X-linked gene expression in females/hermaphrodites by half, causing both sexes to express gene A at half the level of the ancestral species prior to the evolution of sex chromosomes. (<b>D</b>) Prediction for X-linked gene expression when Ohno's mechanism of upregulation operates and the dosage compensation mechanism reduces X gene expression in females. Recognizing that reducing X-chromosome gene expression in females as a mechanism of dosage compensation between sexes might create a deleterious reduction in X-chromosome products for both sexes, Susumo Ohno proposed a two-step mechanism for the regulation of X gene expression. After the degeneration of Y began but before the evolution of dosage compensation, a mechanism would arise to increase X-chromosome gene expression two-fold in both sexes (step 1). This upregulation of X expression would make expression from the male X equal to that of the ancestral autosomes but would cause a two-fold overexpression of X-linked genes in females relative to the ancestral autosomes. The overexpression in females would then be offset by an X-chromosome dosage compensation process that reduced X expression in females, thereby balancing X expression between males and females, as well as balancing expression between female X chromosomes and the ancestral autosomes (step 2)."

The central prediction of Ohno's two-step hypothesis is that the single active X chromosome of males and females will be expressed at the same level as the combined ancestral autosomes. Although expression of ancestral autosomes cannot be measured directly for mammals, it can be estimated, because mammalian sex-chromosome evolution occurred after the divergence of birds and mammals. Thus, expression of orthologous autosomal genes in chickens serves as an estimate for expression of genes on the mammalian proto-X. Comparison between the extant mammalian X chromosome and the orthologous chicken autosome failed to reveal evidence for X-chromosome-wide upregulation in placental mammals (<a href=\"#bib39\">Julien et al., 2012</a>). In these species, genes on the single active X chromosome in males and females are expressed, on average, at half the level of the orthologous pair of autosomes, contrary to Ohno's hypothesis. Although the experimental approach failed to identify a chromosome-wide transcriptional mechanism of X upregulation, it left open the possibility that regulatory mechanisms might have arisen on a gene-by-gene basis to compensate for low activity of critical X-linked genes caused by chromosome-wide reduction of X expression. In contrast, evidence in favor of Ohno's hypothesis exists in marsupials, suggesting that X-chromosome upregulation may have accompanied sex-chromosome evolution in some lineages but not others (<a href=\"#bib39\">Julien et al., 2012</a>)."

First, limited information about the orthology of nematode genes relative to other species makes it premature to estimate the level of gene expression for the <i>C. elegans</i> proto-X chromosome from the expression level of autosomal orthologs in other species. In the absence of information about orthology, the assumption was made in some studies that the average overall expression of all genes on extant autosomes would serve as a proxy for expression of the proto-X chromosome (<a href=\"#bib24\">Deng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kruesi et al., 2013</a>). However, this assumption is undermined by the unexpected observation we report here that average gene expression varies widely (1.9 fold) among the five different autosomes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Hence the previous finding that X expression is equivalent to the average level of autosomal expression does not confirm Ohno's hypothesis. Second, X-chromosome gene expression undergoes transcriptional silencing in germ cells of XX and XO animals (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib62\">Reinke et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kelly et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Deng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Gaydos et al., 2012</a>), which comprise 68% of all adult cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Crittenden et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Morgan et al., 2010</a>), causing tests of Ohno's hypothesis that quantify adult gene expression (<a href=\"#bib76\">Xiong et al., 2010</a>) to underestimate X expression by about 50%.

Our approach quantified gene expression specifically in somatic cells and did not rely on untested assumptions about expression levels of ancestral autosomes. We quantified expression in L1 larvae of the same transgenes integrated in single copy on either the X chromosome or autosomes. The L1 developmental stage occurs prior to the onset of germline proliferation, thereby preventing germline silencing from interfering with our quantification of X-chromosome expression. Moreover, monitoring expression of the same gene in the same species while varying only its location within the genome enabled a direct comparison of X and autosomal expression levels that tests one attractive molecular mechanism (a chromosome-wide mechanism) for upregulating X-chromosome transcription to balance gene expression between X and autosomes."

By monitoring the expression of identical transgenes integrated at various locations along the X chromosome and autosomes, with and without a co-integrated binding site for the dosage compensation machinery, we eliminate the contribution of gene-specific differences in DNA sequence on gene expression and assess the role of chromosome location and proximity to a binding site on the regulation of X-chromosome gene expression, thereby differentiating a global chromosome-wide process from a local gene-by-gene process."

(Left) Under an X-chromosome-wide model of upregulation, dosage-compensated transgenes on hermaphrodite X chromosomes (2 copies) are predicted to have similar average total expression levels as transgenes on autosomes (2 copies), despite the hermaphrodite-specific repression by the DCC. Moreover, because the DCC reduces gene expression on X by about half, <i>sdc-2(RNAi)</i> animals would be predicted to have two-fold more transgene expression on X relative to autosomes, if X-chromosome upregulation occurred. (Middle) Under a model of no X-chromosome-wide upregulation, dosage compensated transgenes would be expressed at half the level of transgenes on autosomes due to repression by the DCC. In DCC-defective XX animals, transgene expression on X (2 copies) would increase to the level of transgene expression on autosomes (2 copies). (Right) The results of comparing the average expression level of all transgenes on X and autosomes argue against a chromosome-wide model of X-chromosome upregulation. For each reporter, data were normalized to the average autosomal expression level and then combined. Numbers above the graph show the fold change in expression between transgenes on X and on autosomes in control RNAi animals or between transgenes on X in <i>sdc-2(RNAi)</i> animals and transgenes on autosomes in control RNAi animals. The normalized expression level of all transgenes on the X chromosome (light blue) is only 56% of the normalized expression level of all transgenes on autosomes (gray).

(<b>B</b>) Comparison of averaged mRNA expression for all reporter transgenes of each type located at all sites on X or autosomes as quantified in (<b>A</b>), except that expression levels were not normalized to the average autosome expression level.

For the transgene cassette <i>Pdpy-30:gfp:H2B</i> and <i>Cbr-unc-119</i>, the autosomal cassette was on chromosome IV at site 1, and the X cassette was at site 3. For the transgene cassette <i>Peft-3:gfp</i> and <i>Cbr-unc-119</i>, the autosomal cassette was on chromosome I at site 1 and the X cassette at site 1. Shown below each bar are the sex of the animals in which gene expression was quantified, the copy number of the reporter transgene, and the position of the quantified reporter transgene (either on X or autosomes). For all transgenes, we compared the total level of expression from two reporter copies in XX animals and one reporter copy in XO animals, regardless of whether the reporters were on X or an autosome. The fold change in gene expression between reporters on X and autosomes is given above the graphs.

Error bars show the standard error of the mean for at least three biological replicates. Expression of two copies on X was about half the expression of two copies on autosomes. Similarly, expression of the single copy on males was not different from the single copy on autosomes, meaning that expression of one copy on the male X would be half the expression of two copies on male autosomes. Results in (<b>B</b>,<b>C</b>) argue against an Ohno-like mechanism of X-chromosome upregulation in which chromosome-wide transcription of X is increased in expression. The results do not exclude the possibility that diverse gene-specific mechanisms might have arisen to elevate expression of individual X-linked genes with reduced dose."

Hence, DCC binding near a gene could not be the sole determinant of dosage compensation. An alternate interpretation by others posited that DCC binding near a gene is essential for its repression, but elevated expression in dosage-compensation mutants of genes lacking a DCC binding site was an indirect consequence of the mis-regulation of other genes on X, instead of the attenuation of a chromosome-wide mechanism (<a href=\"#bib68\">Strome et al., 2014</a>)."

The former criterion averted any potential differences due to sex-specific gene expression, and the latter criterion averted any complications that might arise from the disruption of dosage compensation and consequent elevation of X expression. Second, only transgenes on X were responsive to the dosage compensation process. Indirect effects caused by the disruption of dosage compensation would be predicted to affect transgenes on autosomes as well. Third, close proximity of strong DCC recruitment sites to transgenes on autosomes did not elicit gene repression. That is, in wild-type XX embryos, expression of transgenes on autosomes was not lower in the presence of nearby <i>rex</i> sites than in their absence, and transgenes co-inserted with <i>rex</i> sites were not generally increased in expression in dosage-compensation-defective mutants, further demonstrating that local DCC binding is not sufficient to establish dosage compensation."

The study found that in XO animals, the new genes on the <i>C. elegans</i> X chromosome were expressed, on average, at about half the level of their autosomal orthologs in <i>P. pacificus</i>, a result the study concluded is inconsistent with chromosome-wide upregulation of X. While this study bypassed the need to approximate the proto-X expression level, it did not take into account X-chromosome silencing during germ cell proliferation. Expression of X chromosomes and autosomes was measured in young adults, leaving open the possibility that the reduction in expression of 276 genes on the <i>C. elegans</i> X chromosome was due to X-chromosome-specific germline silencing, rather than lack of X-chromosome upregulation in somatic cells. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that expression of the 276 genes was higher in somatic cells of <i>C. elegans</i> germlineless XX L4 larvae than in the combination of somatic and germ cells found in fertile, wild-type L4 XX larvae (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Therefore, germline silencing, which causes an underestimate of somatic gene expression in both sexes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Deng et al., 2011</a>), is a plausible cause for the apparent reduction in expression of genes naturally translocated to X during evolution compared to their expression when sited on autosomes.

In addition, for some X-linked genes, evidence also exists for enhanced mRNA stability or enhanced translational efficiency via increased ribosome density as possible mechanisms to compensate for reduced gene dose (<a href=\"#bib23\">Deng et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Faucillion and Larsson, 2015</a>)."

The primers used are as follows: <i>rex-23</i> F (gcccattcaacccattgtcc); <i>rex-23</i> R (gcactcgcatattccaaaacg); <i>rex-32</i>\u00a0F\u00a0(cgcagctggccgttaaatg); <i>rex</i>-<i>32</i> R (cattgcaggtgcgttcacaac); <i>rex-47</i> F (ccgaaacacaacaacaatgc); <i>rex-47</i> R (agactggcgaagaggaacaa); <i>rex-8</i> F (tgtgatgcaagccagagttgg); <i>rex-8</i> R (cattgagccgaatttccaaagg). For younger embryos, the FISH probes were made from 30 kb fosmid probes as follows: <i>rex-47</i>, WRM0631aB04; <i>rex-23</i>, WRM0626cG08; <i>rex-32</i>, WRM0638aF07. To assess the nuclear position of the endogenous <i>rex-33</i> site in both younger and older embryos, FISH probes were made to two overlapping fosmids (WRM0615aA09 and WRM063cD06) that were labeled with different fluorescent dyes. Quantification was performed only on FISH spots that had signals from both fosmids to unambiguously identify <i>bona fide</i> FISH spots."

Following FISH, immunostaining with rabbit DPY-27 antibody (rb699) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chuang et al., 1994</a>) and Alexa-Fluor-647 goat anti-rat antibody (Invitrogen) was performed to determine the sex of embryos for experiments involving ectopic <i>rex</i> sites on autosomes and older embryos for endogenous <i>rex</i> sites on X. Embryos were determined to be XX if they exhibited punctate DPY-27 staining on both X chromosomes and XO if they lacked DPY-27 staining. Sex was determined for all embryos examining <i>rex-33</i> localization and all younger embryos examining localization of endogenous <i>rex</i> sites on X by counting the number of FISH spots in the nuclei. Embryos were determined to be XX if the nuclei had two FISH spots and XO if nuclei had one FISH spot. The age of embryos was determined by counting the number of DAPI-stained nuclei using the FindPoints function in Priism software (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 1996</a>). Confocal image stacks with a 51.5 nm XY pixel size and an 83.9 nm Z-spacing were obtained on a Leica TCS SP8 microscope using a 63\u00d7, 1.4 NA objective lens. Our Z-spacing was smaller than that used in (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sharma et al., 2014</a>), making our point picking more precise. Their XY pixel size was not available for comparison. Image deconvolution with a theoretical point spread function was performed using Huygens Professional Software (Scientific Volume Imaging, The Netherlands). FISH spots were identified using the FindPoints function. To unambiguously select <i>bona fide</i> FISH spots, we excluded nuclei that showed more than one or two spots for XO and XX embryos, respectively. The nuclear positioning of the FISH signals was measured using a previously described approach (<a href=\"#bib50\">Meister et al., 2010</a>), but with the Pick Points function in Priism software. Spots at the top or bottom of nuclei were excluded."

Two types of imbalance occur due to the sex chromosomes in <i>C. elegans</i>: one between the sexes and the other between the single X copy in males and the autosomes present in two copies. Dosage compensation between the sexes is achieved by repression of each X chromosome in XX hermaphrodites by the well-studied DCC (dosage compensation complex) recruited to <i>rex</i> sites on the X chromosomes. Dosage compensation between autosomes and X chromosome is less well characterized. Using a large panel of single copy transgenes (two different reporters under three different gene promoters in various combinations located) on the X chromosome (28 transgenes) or on autosomes (36 transgenes), the authors investigate transcriptomes from XX and XO individuals for evidence of either type of dosage compensation. RNA Seq is used to assess the extent to which transgenes shows differences in expression when X-linked or autosomal, in XX versus XO individuals. L1 larvae taken within 3 hours of hatching were examined, as these do not yet have germ cells, thus avoiding the problem of X-chromosome silencing which would interfere with the accuracy of X/A expression measurements."

As the authors have used transgenes, one interpretation of their data is that whatever the mechanism of up-regulation of the X relative to autosomes, this does not spread to transgenes inserted on the X. In fact, as different strategies of up-regulation may apply to different X-linked genes, it is difficult to probe this using transgenes. Furthermore, results from transgenes cannot really be used to deduce whether endogenous X-linked genes are up-regulated during evolution as the authors propose. Ohno's original text and hypothesis does not state that X up-regulation occurred on a chromosome-wide basis. Ohno hypothesized an up-regulation of X-linked genes during millions of years of sex chromosome evolution prior to the evolution of repression of X-linked gene expression in females. Inserting a transgene on the autosomes or X chromosome and requiring an immediate up-regulation of the X-linked copy in essentially one generation cannot be a valid test of this hypothesis."

While our experiments don't rule out the possibility that an upregulation mechanism might become more potent or act, in part, after the L1 stage, we would be very surprised not to find evidence of the effects at the L1 stage. Furthermore, the X/A gene expression ratio is not widely variable over developmental stages if one uses germlineless animals to make the comparisons. Deng et al. 2011 showed the X:A expression ratios to be 1.08 (early embryo), 1.32 (late embryo), 1.21 (L1), 1.3 (L2), 1.2 (L4). Also, if one compares average expression of individual chromosomes from germlineless L4 larvae, the expression differences between X and autosomes is as variable as we report in embryos.
