Mutations in <i>leopard</i> (<i>leo</i>), encoding Connexin 41.8 (Cx41.8), a gap junction subunit, cause a phenotypic series of spotted patterns. A new dominant allele, <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup>, leads to a complete loss of the pattern, suggesting a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions. In a genetic screen, we identified this component as Cx39.4 (<i>luchs</i>). Loss-of-function alleles demonstrate that <i>luchs</i> is required for stripe formation in zebrafish; however, the fins are almost not affected. Double mutants and chimeras, which show that <i>leo</i> and <i>luchs</i> are only required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not in iridophores, suggest that both connexins form heteromeric gap junctions. The phenotypes indicate that these promote homotypic interactions between melanophores and xanthophores, respectively, and those cells instruct the patterning of the iridophores."

Mutations in <i>leopard</i> (<i>leo</i>), encoding Connexin 41.8 (Cx41.8), a gap junction subunit, cause a phenotypic series of spotted patterns. A new dominant allele, <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup>, leads to a complete loss of the pattern, suggesting a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions. In a genetic screen, we identified this component as Cx39.4 (<i>luchs</i>). Loss-of-function alleles demonstrate that <i>luchs</i> is required for stripe formation in zebrafish; however, the fins are almost not affected. Double mutants and chimeras, which show that <i>leo</i> and <i>luchs</i> are only required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not in iridophores, suggest that both connexins form heteromeric gap junctions. The phenotypes indicate that these promote homotypic interactions between melanophores and xanthophores, respectively, and those cells instruct the patterning of the iridophores."

The silvery, reflective iridophores are the first of the cells to populate the skin, giving rise to the first light stripe. They then form a dense network of cells that breaks up to form the darker stripes. However, iridophores are not required to form stripes in the fins, suggesting that patterning occurs differently in the fins and the body."

At the onset of metamorphosis, iridophores appear in the skin at the region of the horizontal myoseptum that provides a morphological pre-pattern (<a href=\"#bib8\">Frohnhofer et al., 2013</a>). They proliferate and spread as densely connected cells to form the first light stripe. While spreading further ventrally and dorsally, into the regions where the first two dark stripes will form, they change their appearance and become more loose, then they aggregate again at a distance to form the next light stripes (Singh et al., 2013). Larval xanthophores, covering the flank of the fish, start to proliferate and re-organize into densely packed compact cells above the dense iridophores of the light stripe and into more loosely organized, stellate cells in the dark stripe regions (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mahalwar et al., 2014</a>). Melanoblasts migrate along spinal nerves into the skin in the presumptive stripe regions where they finally differentiate and expand to fill the space (<a href=\"#bib2\">Budi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Dooley et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">McMenamin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Singh et al., 2014</a>).

In a genetic screen, we found two dominant alleles of a gene we named <i>luchs</i> (<i>luc</i>) as enhancers of the <i>leo</i> loss-of-function phenotype. We show that the <i>luc</i> gene codes for another connexin, Cx39.4.

Further we show that both genes, <i>leo</i> and <i>luc</i>, are required in the trunk in xanthophores and in melanophores, but not in iridophores. Our results suggest that Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 form heteromeric gap junction channels in the plasma membranes of melanophores and xanthophores. In the complete absence of the channels, iridophores take over and almost fully fill the space normally occupied by alternating light and dark stripes, whereas melanophores are suppressed. This suggests that the heteromeric gap junctions function in the communication between xanthophores and melanophores and potentially in the transduction of signals to the dense iridophores to induce the transition into the loose shape required for dark stripe formation."

Interestingly, double mutants homozygous for loss-of-function alleles of <i>leo</i> and <i>luc</i> display a phenotype which is indistinguishable from that of homozygous mutants of the dominant <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup> allele and slightly stronger than that of the homozygous dominant alleles of <i>luc</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This indicates that the dominant negative effect observed in <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup> is mediated through connexin 39.4, and that in <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup> both the <i>leo</i> and <i>luc</i> functions are abolished. Our results are most easily explained if the two connexins form heteromeric gap junctions."

The first signs of the phenotype become visible at stage PR (8.6 mm SSL). When in wild-type, melanophores gather immediately dorsally and ventrally to the dense iridophores of the first light stripe, they stay more dispersed in the mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013E</a>). Dense iridophores covered with xanthophores disperse in an irregular manner in the mutants to form a wider first light stripe, branching into the dark stripe region and suppressing melanophores dorsally and ventrally to form irregular patches (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013J</a>). At stage J++, when in wild-type three dark and three light stripes are formed, in the <i>luc</i> and <i>leo</i> loss-of-function mutants the spotted pattern is already clearly apparent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L,M</a>) and the dominant mutants show fields of dense iridophores and xanthophores with few, scattered melanophores (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4N,O</a>).

However, iridophores do not autonomously require the <i>leo</i> or <i>luc</i> function (see below, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,A\u2032</a>). This suggests that iridophore behaviour is affected via xanthophores and/or melanophores. From the <i>pfe</i> phenotype an inhibitory effect of xanthophores on the expansion of dense melanophores has been deduced: in the absence of xanthophores, the dense iridophore regions of the light stripe expand and ingress into the stripe region, breaking it up into spots (<a href=\"#bib8\">Frohnhofer et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, we assume that xanthophores mutant for <i>leo</i> and <i>luc</i> have lost their ability to restrict the expansion of dense iridophores.

                                "text": "Chimeric animals created by blastomere transplantations suggested that the function of <i>leo</i> is required in melanophores and in xanthophores (<a href=\"#bib30\">Maderspacher and Nusslein-Volhard, 2003</a>). The requirement in iridophores had not been tested. We assessed the requirement in all three chromatophore types by creating chimeric animals with the allele <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup>, where all <i>leo</i> and <i>luc</i> function is absent. In these experiments, we used appropriate combinations of mutant donor and host embryos to assert that in the chimeric animals only one of the three chromatophore types was mutant. First, we tested whether <i>luc</i> and <i>leo</i> have any function in iridophores. Therefore we transplanted cells from <i>nac;pfe;leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup> donors into <i>rse</i> hosts (that lack iridophores). The donor embryos, due to mutations in <i>nac</i> and <i>pfe,</i> provide mutant iridophores as the only chromatophore type, whereas the melanophores and xanthophores of the chimeric animals must result from the <i>rse</i> mutant host that can form only rudimentary stripes. Thus, chimeric animals develop with <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup> mutant iridophores juxtaposed to wild-type xanthophores and melanophores. In these animals, clusters of donor derived mutant iridophores can cause a complete restoration of the stripe pattern (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,A\u2032</a>), demonstrating that the function of <i>leo</i> and <i>luc</i> is not required in iridophores. Next, we tested the requirement for <i>leo</i> and <i>luc</i> function in xanthophores. Therefore we created chimeric fish with mutant xanthophores next to wild-type melanophores by transplanting cells from <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup><i>;spa;rse</i> mutant blastula embryos (that provide mutant xanthophores [<a href=\"#bib38\">Parichy et al., 1999</a>]) into <i>pfe</i> hosts (lacking xanthophores). Whereas the transplantation of wild-type xanthophore progenitors can completely restore the striped pattern (<a href=\"#bib37\">Parichy and Turner, 2003</a>), the chimeric animals that received <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup> xanthophores display a distribution of melanophores strongly resembling the <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup> mutant phenotype, indicating that mutant xanthophores cannot restore the wild-type striped pattern (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,B\u2032</a>). Therefore the <i>leo;luc</i> function must be required cell autonomously in xanthophores. Finally, we assessed the function of <i>leo</i> and <i>luc</i> in melanophores by transplanting cells from <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup><i>;pfe;rse</i> donor embryos into <i>nac</i> hosts. In these cases, where mutant melanophores are confronted with non-mutant xanthophores and iridophores, we again did not get a normal stripe pattern. However, the mutant melanophores did cluster together producing meandering fields of cells rather than creating spots or staying as individual cells, like in <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,C\u2032</a>). This indicates that the function of <i>leo</i> and <i>luc</i> is required in melanophores, but the wild-type xanthophores are able to exert some normalising influence over the mutant melanophores. Similar transplantation experiments using <i>leo</i><sup><i>t1</i></sup> or <i>luc</i><sup><i>tXG1</i></sup> embryos instead of <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup> confirm that <i>leo</i> and <i>luc</i> are required in xanthophores and, to a lesser extent, in melanophores, but not in iridophores (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, heteromeric connexons formed by Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 are not required in iridophores, but the function of <i>leo</i> and <i>luc</i> is required in melanophores and xanthophores instructing iridophores."

In the complete absence of Cx41.8 protein, in <i>leo</i><sup><i>t1</i></sup> mutants, there is still some patterning activity present, leading to the formation of spots. The homozygous <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup> phenotype is considerably stronger than this, indicating that the mutant Cx41.8 protein present in <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup> cells has a dominant negative effect on some further component(s) involved in pigment pattern formation. In a simple model, this additional factor could be another connexin involved in the formation of heteromeric gap junctions together with Cx41.8, a notion that has been suggested previously, based on the analysis of <i>leo</i><sup><i>tq270</i></sup> (<a href=\"#bib49\">Watanabe et al., 2006</a>). The zebrafish genome contains 37 genes coding for connexins and it is impossible to deduce from the predicted amino acid sequences alone possible partners for Cx41.8. Therefore we performed a mutagenesis of <i>leo</i><sup><i>t1</i></sup> fish and screened for mutants enhancing the phenotype to a strength similar to <i>leo</i><sup><i>tK3</i></sup>. In this screen we identified two dominant alleles of <i>luc</i>; we show that <i>luc</i> encodes another connexin, Cx39.4, and that loss-of-function of <i>luc</i> leads to a phenotype very similar to that of <i>leo</i><sup><i>t1</i></sup>. The loss of both connexins results in a phenotype that is as strong as the one seen in homozygous mutants for the dominant alleles of <i>leo</i> or <i>luc</i>. Therefore the strong phenotypes of the dominant alleles can be fully explained by the loss of the two proteins."

However, Cx39.4 is the only \u03b1-Connexin where the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 23 amino acids is extended by two residues. As in the case of Cx41.8, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain in Cx39.4 also contains an ExxE motif, therefore the conductivity of gap junctions formed by Cx39.4 could also be regulated by polyamines (<a href=\"#bib34\">Musa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Watanabe et al., 2012</a>).

The function of both genes is also required in xanthophores; mutant xanthophores, when confronted with wild-type melanophores in the chimeras, do not generate a wild-type pattern but spot or disperse melanophores in large dense iridophore regions. When we tested iridophores we found that they require neither <i>leo</i> nor <i>luc</i> function, as the mutant cells can contribute to a completely wild-type pattern if they are next to other wild-type cells. This is surprising and indicates that the dramatic expansion of the dense iridophores that is associated with the mutant phenotypes is an indirect effect, possibly caused by mutant xanthophores covering the iridophores."

Recently it was shown that proliferation and dispersal of iridophores during metamorphosis, the time when the adult pigment pattern is generated, outline the light and dark stripe regions in the trunk of zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib45\">Singh et al., 2014</a>); at the same time the larval xanthophores also start to proliferate, they re-organize and change their shapes to densely cover the light stripe regions and loosely the dark melanophore stripes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mahalwar et al., 2014</a>). This raises the possibility that in normal development the xanthophores, which cover the iridophores, induce the transition to the loose form when they reach the regions destined to form dark stripes. It is interesting in this context that in <i>schachbrett</i> (<i>sbr</i>) mutants, which display interrupted dark stripes, the affected gene is specifically expressed in iridophores and codes for Tight Junction Protein 1a (Tjp1a, ZO-1) (Andrey Fadeev, JK, HGF, and CN-V, submitted). If gap junctions are indeed involved in the signalling events between xanthophores and iridophores, there must be (at least) one, so far unidentified, connexin, which is expressed in iridophores. Alternatively, other signalling pathways could be responsible for the cross-talk between iridophores and xanthophores, and gap junctions might only be required for the homotypic interactions among xanthophores. Whether direct interactions between xanthophores and melanophores, which have been demonstrated in an in vitro system (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yamanaka and Kondo, 2014</a>), are also possible in vivo is not known. In the skin of the fish these two cell types are always separated by a layer of iridophores (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hirata et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Watanabe et al., 2006</a>), however, recently it has been shown that melanophores of the dark stripe produce long cellular extensions reaching towards the light stripe xanthophores (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hamada et al., 2014</a>); these extensions could allow direct contact between melanophores and xanthophores. These direct cell-to-cell contacts would permit communication between the cells via gap junctions."

The sgRNA was transcribed from the linearized vector using the Megascript Kit (Ambion). The efficiency of indel generation was tested on eight larvae at 4 dpf by PCR and sequence analysis. The other injected larvae were raised to adulthood and mature F<sub>0</sub> fish with pigmentation pattern defects were incrossed. F<sub>1</sub> fish from these crosses were genotyped and fish with 2 bp and 22 bp deletions were used to establish mutant stocks."

Irion and colleagues use forward and reverse genetic methods in zebrafish to identify a new gene that contributes to stripe formation. By performing a genetic modifier screen in the <i>leo</i> (t1) background, they identified two alleles of cx39.4, which they refer to as luchs. Using transplantation and mutant crosses, they propose a model where cx39.4 and cx41.8 form a heteromeric gap junction required in xanthophores and melanophores, although there are no biochemical experiments to prove this. They conclude that xanthophores mutant for the two channels lack the ability to restrict the expansion of dense iridophores (iridophores are otherwise confined to light stripes) resulting in the visual phenotype of light stripes expanded into the dark stripes. In addition the channels are necessary within melanophores for the homotypic clustering of melanophores in the absence of xanthophores."

There are very few other published examples of enhancer and suppressor screens using zebrafish. Another strength is the construction of appropriate triple mutants that establish that melanophores and xanthophores, but not iridophores, require connnexins 41.8 and 39.4 autonomously for the proper organization of the iridophores."

Without one further generation of inbreeding only 3 in 256 donor fish will have at least one copy of the transgene and be homozygous for the three mutations; therefore we did not carry out these experiments."
