Interestingly, an online survey reveals that most experts in the field recognize the lack of convincing evidence for this phenomenon, and yet they persist in this belief. Using a recently developed bias-free experimental procedure for measuring subjective introspection (confidence), we found no evidence for unconscious perception; participants\u2019 behavior matched that of a Bayesian ideal observer, even though the stimuli were visually masked. This surprising finding suggests that the thresholds for subjective awareness and objective discrimination are <i>effectively the same</i>: if objective task performance is above chance, there is likely conscious experience. These findings shed new light on decades-old methodological issues regarding what it takes to consider a neurobiological or behavioral effect to be 'unconscious,' and provide a platform for rigorously investigating unconscious perception in future studies."

Subjects discriminated two stimulus intervals, only one of which contained a target, and indicated confidence in their decisions using a 2-interval forced-choice procedure (2IFC), that\u00a0is, indicating which of the two discrimination decisions they felt more confident in. This approach has several advantages. First, 2IFC tasks depend little on response bias compared to multi-point confidence-rating scales. Maintaining the criteria for extensive confidence scales may also be demanding, leading subjects to respond somewhat randomly in conditions of vague awareness and thereby producing the negative result <a href=\"#bib18\">Kolb and Braun (1995)</a> observed (<a href=\"#bib26\">Morgan et al., 1997</a>). Second, the interpretation of 2IFC confidence-rating in this context is straightforward: \u2018Performance without Awareness\u2019 would mean subjects can perform the target discrimination yet fail to place bets appropriately to distinguish this performance from discrimination of a blank stimulus (which guarantees chance performance). That is, following psychophysics traditions (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kolb and Braun, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Peirce and Jastrow, 1884</a>), if a certain above-chance discrimination seems introspectively no different from a random guess based on no stimulus at all (as reflected by betting behavior), we interpret the discrimination to be unconscious. Here, we explored whether such Performance without Awareness occurs in normal observers in two behavioral experiments, and compared these results to predictions of a Bayesian ideal observer."

In other words, observers may bet on the target-present interval <i>less often</i> than they get the discrimination correct, but still <i>above chance</i>. This would occur because the orientation discrimination choice requires evaluation of only one interval (the one with the target in it) and therefore is subject to only one source of uncertainty, but the \u2018betting\u2019 choice requires evaluation of both intervals, and therefore has two potential sources of uncertainty.

Thus, they were probably truly rating confidence and not simply engaging in 2IFC detection. In keeping with this observation, we also plotted orientation discrimination accuracy conditional upon subjects\u2019 selection of the target-present interval, i.e. <i>p(correct<sub>orientationDiscrimination</sub>\u00a0|\u00a0target-present selected)</i> and <i>p(correct<sub>orientationDiscrimination</sub>\u00a0|\u00a0target-present not selected)</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,F</a>).

However, one concern might be that subjects are able to meaningfully rate confidence despite no subjective visual experience of the stimulus due to some sort of non-visual \u2018hunch\u2019 or \u2018feeling\u2019. Indeed, such metacognitive insights (the ability to introspectively distinguish between correct and incorrect responses) have recently been reported even in the absence of objective task performance sensitivity, although not in the context of perception (e.g., <a href=\"#bib34\">Scott et al., 2014</a>)."

However, we also ran a control study in which the subjective task was to indicate which interval appeared more <i>visible</i> rather than confidence in the corresponding discrimination. In other words, it was akin to a 2IFC detection task rather than a metacognitive judgment. Results of this control study (<a href=\"#app3\">Appendix 3</a>) mirrored those of the main experiments: as soon as participants were able to discriminate the target above chance, they were able to indicate which interval contained the target above chance. Thus, even when the 2IFC task was visibility judgment rather than confidence, subjects\u2019 behavior was inconsistent with the Performance without Awareness pattern -- suggesting there is also no Performance without <i>Visual</i> Awareness.

That the ideal observer exhibits behavior that may <i>seem</i> suboptimal, and in the same pattern as human observers, confirms that this perhaps counterintuitive but optimal behavior arises from the confidence-comparison nature of the 2IFC confidence-rating task: the decision about orientation in the target-present interval is limited by one source of noise (the single target-present interval), but the comparison of confidence is limited by the system\u2019s noise in <i>both</i> intervals. So even if confidence monotonically increases with accuracy for the target-present interval, there will be trials in which \u2013 by chance \u2013 the discrimination choice for the blank (target-absent) interval happens to seem more confident, that\u00a0is, its posterior probability is larger. This will happen sometimes even on trials in which the observer gets the target-present orientation discrimination correct. In these trials, the observer (human or simulated) will select the target-absent interval. This process will lead to the appearance of what we called Performance &gt; Awareness, as displayed by our human participants and ideal observer (refer also to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> for additional explanation). Thus, the subjective ratings by human participants are already close to ideal, as if the actual effective threshold for subjective awareness is no different from the objective threshold for discrimination. Importantly, this is true despite the apparent measured differences in psychophysically defined thresholds (75%)."

However, our findings bear upon those studies, too. Traditionally, interpreting such effects as unconscious required that the relevant stimuli yield zero sensitivity in a direct task (d\u2019 = 0). Recently, many have relaxed this requirement and considered <i>subjectively</i> reported lack of awareness as sufficient (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pessiglione et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Soto et al., 2011</a>), presumably because we (wrongly) believed that certain stimuli might surpass the objective threshold while still being below the subjective one. One may also argue that while objective threshold requirements are rigorous, the valid and meaningful measure is the subjective threshold (<a href=\"#bib5\">Charles et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Merikle et al., 2001</a>). Our results suggest this reasoning is flawed. If a stimulus surpasses the objective threshold, there is likely conscious experience; subjects likely <i>report</i> lack of awareness because they interpret the response options in relative terms in the context of stimuli of various strengths. This undermines claims that higher-cognitive phenomena \u2013 e.g. working memory, error detection, or motivation \u2013 can really operate unconsciously, if assessed with reference to subjective rather than objective thresholds (<a href=\"#bib5\">Charles et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pessiglione et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Soto et al., 2011</a>)."

In Experiment 2, we wanted to motivate subjects to bet on the target-present interval as much as possible, to maximize the possibility of observers performing optimally (i.e., to alleviate any Performance &gt; Awareness). So, we defined a \u2018correct\u2019 Type 2 judgment for the purposes of feedback only as a Type 2 hit, i.e. trials in which the observer correctly discriminated the target-present interval and bet on the target-present interval. Subjects were also informed that in one of the intervals the target was physically absent, and that betting on that interval would not earn them a point even if they \u2018discriminated\u2019 its orientation correctly (as before, they still had a 50% chance to earn a point for \u2018correctly discriminating\u2019 the target-absent interval; subjects were made aware of this structure). Additionally, we provided \u2018correct/incorrect\u2019 feedback on the Type 2 responses to further encourage betting on the target-present interval. Finally, we altered the question order such that after each interval was presented, subjects pressed a button to discriminate the interval, and then only after both intervals had been presented did they indicate which choice they would like to bet on. In this way, subjects were allowed the ability to monitor their own reaction times, which ought to be faster for target-present intervals on average (as target-absent intervals are simply guesses by definition); this would provide another source of potential information to contribute to confidence judgments, as it has been shown that subjects use reaction time monitoring to inform confidence judgments (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kiani et al., 2014</a>). Points were awarded as in Experiment 1, and the same bonus payment motivation was employed.

This means that even though participants\u2019 data lie near the identity line of equal orientation percent correct and percent betting on the TP interval (dashed diagonal line) \u2013 <i>above</i> the behavior predicted by the confidence model \u2013 this should not be taken to mean they are displaying any sort of \u2018supra-optimal\u2019 behavior, as the tasks are fundamentally different. The position of responses on this graph for this task will depend on the precise relationship between the detectability and discriminability of the stimulus for each individual subject (<a href=\"#bib39\">Thomas et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Thomas, 1987</a>)."

Methodologically, it is one of the very best articles that tackle this question of \"perception without awareness\".

The application of appropriate psychophysical methods/ Bayesian modelling is refreshing in a (sub-)field that has often relied on ad-hoc assumptions about how visual signals are encoded and converted to a decision. However, at present the quality of the data are not sufficient to allow the reader to draw unambiguous conclusions. For this paper to have the importance it deserves, it has to have better data. This data should be easy to obtain: it should be straightforward to run the tests on more subjects."

In both experiments, participants viewed two intervals in which they were required to discriminate the orientation (right or left tilt) a Gabor patch target embedded in forward- and backward-masks (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>), and judged which of the discrimination choices they felt more confident in. Crucially, in one of the intervals the target was absent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), such that above-chance discrimination performance was impossible. We performed two experiments to assess the potential contributions of question order, receipt of feedback, and a priori knowledge of the presence of a target-absent interval (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In Experiment 1, participants judged which decision they felt more confident in and then indicated their orientation decisions for both intervals, while in Experiment 2 they indicated their orientation discrimination decisions before selecting the more-confident interval. In Experiment 2, we also provided feedback on the confidence decision, and told participants that one interval contained no target; this information was withheld from participants in Experiment 1. Stimuli, timing details, and order of question prompts in the two experiments are also discussed in greater detail in the Methods section."

That is, observers correctly discriminate the target\u2019s orientation more than 50% of the time, but bet on the target-present interval 50% of the time (i.e., they bet randomly on the target-present versus target-absent interval), indicating they are not aware of the information that contributed to their discrimination decision.

This concept can also be applied to subjective betting data in the sense that betting on the target-present interval could be considered \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cadvantageous\u201d betting. In this sense (threshold = 75% correct performance), the subjective threshold for confidence might be above the objective threshold for discrimination. In other words, observers may bet on the target-present interval less often than they get the discrimination correct, but still above chance. This would occur because the orientation discrimination choice requires evaluation of only one interval (the one with the target in it) and therefore is subject to only one source of uncertainty, but the \u201cbetting\u201d choice requires evaluation of both intervals, and therefore has two potential sources of uncertainty. This pattern of behavior (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) may occur even if subjects do not display Performance without Awareness, and would be characterized by a pattern of responses that fall below the identity line (diagonal dashed line).
