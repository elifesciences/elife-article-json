Here, we elucidated the unique shape of cells in the cornified stratified epithelia of the mammalian epidermis that allows them to achieve homeostasis of the tight junction (TJ) barrier. Using intimate in vivo 3D imaging, we found that the basic shape of TJ-bearing cells is a flattened Kelvin's tetrakaidecahedron (f-TKD), an optimal shape for filling space. In vivo live imaging further elucidated the dynamic replacement of TJs on the edges of f-TKD cells that enables the TJ-bearing cells to translocate across the TJ barrier. We propose a spatiotemporal orchestration model of f-TKD cell turnover, where in the classic context of 'form follows function', cell shape provides a fundamental basis for the barrier homeostasis and physical strength of cornified stratified epithelia."

Here, we elucidated the unique shape of cells in the cornified stratified epithelia of the mammalian epidermis that allows them to achieve homeostasis of the tight junction (TJ) barrier. Using intimate in vivo 3D imaging, we found that the basic shape of TJ-bearing cells is a flattened Kelvin's tetrakaidecahedron (f-TKD), an optimal shape for filling space. In vivo live imaging further elucidated the dynamic replacement of TJs on the edges of f-TKD cells that enables the TJ-bearing cells to translocate across the TJ barrier. We propose a spatiotemporal orchestration model of f-TKD cell turnover, where in the classic context of 'form follows function', cell shape provides a fundamental basis for the barrier homeostasis and physical strength of cornified stratified epithelia."

Epidermal barrier dysfunctions cause not only lethal congenital disorders, but also a predisposition to the development of allergic diseases (<a href=\"#bib26\">McGrath and Uitto, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akiyama, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kubo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Weidinger and Novak, 2015</a>). The mammalian epidermis has two main physical barriers, an air-liquid interface barrier formed by the stratum corneum (SC) and a liquid-liquid interface barrier formed by tight junctions (TJs) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kubo et al., 2012</a>). The TJ is a specialized intercellular adhesion complex that is crucial for epidermal barrier function, as it seals the paracellular space of epithelial cellular sheets (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tsukita et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Van Itallie and Anderson, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Krug et al., 2014</a>).

During the course of its upward movement, a keratinocyte becomes flattened at the SG, forms TJs with adjacent cells in the SG2 layer (the second cell layer of the SG), loses its TJs in the SG1 layer (the top layer of the SG) and is finally cornified to form the SC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kubo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yoshida et al., 2013</a>).

Closer observation of a particular TJ polygon identified the systematic temporal order of events for its dynamic appearance and disappearance. Namely, a new smaller (interior) polygon appeared beneath a pre-existing (exterior) polygon, forming a double-edged polygon as observed in the fixed samples (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), followed by disappearance of the exterior polygon (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Replacement of the old exterior polygon by a new interior polygon resulted in natural translocation of the cell body placed between the two polygons from the inside to the outside of the TJ barrier (discussed below in the cell turnover model, Figure 4B). These findings indicate that the double-edged polygons are where cells translocate across the TJ barrier and thus are the key structures for barrier homeostasis."

Claudin-1, a major transmembrane protein of epidermal TJ (<a href=\"#bib10\">Furuse et al., 2002</a>), was localized to both the exterior and interior polygons (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In simple epithelia, most TJs are formed as conventional bicellular TJs (bTJs) on the apical edges between two cells, and tricellular TJs (tTJs) are formed at tricellular contacts among three cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u00a0and B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Furuse et al., 2014</a>). In stratified epithelia of the epidermis, we observed the localization of tTJ-specific proteins (angulin-1 and tricellulin) on all edges of the interior polygons of the double-edged ZO-1-positive polygons, while the exterior polygons were bTJs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,E</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). This is a striking contrast to the single-edged polygons, where tTJ-specific proteins were found as dots or short lines at the vertices as in simple epithelia (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These findings indicate that the interior TJ polygons consist of tTJs, suggesting that the edges of the interior polygons are tricellular contacts between three TJ-forming cells (discussed below in Figure 4B and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The nominal values for the model parameters were determined so that the simulated dynamics reproduce the experimentally observed ratio of double-edged polygons among all the polygons (9.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6%, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), as well as the average time required for cell turnover from entering to exiting the SG2 layer (24 hr), estimated from the average cell turnover rate in mouse ear epidermis (<a href=\"#bib32\">Potten, 1975</a>). Computational simulation of the in silico model (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#media9\">Videos 9</a> and <a href=\"#media10\">10</a>) reproduced the entire sequence of TJ replacement on f-TKD cells, including formation of TJs, transition of the f-TKD cells, and upward movement of differentiated keratinocytes as a stratified cell sheet, while maintaining the relative location of individual f-TKD cells. It therefore confirmed the maintenance of TJ barrier homeostasis, cell-cell adhesion, and the physical strength of the cell sheet during cell turnover."

In the EPU model, the regular interdigitation pattern of the SC is explained by the regular kinetics of basal layer stem cells in each EPU. However, recent in vivo cell-fate-tracing studies demonstrated more random cell fate decisions in the basal cell layer, with EPU model-like upward cell movement funneling into the cell columns of the SG, leading to a new concept: the epidermal differentiation unit (EDU) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rompolas et al., 2016</a>).

The cells originate from stem cells in the basal layer and are randomly supplied to a spinous layer. Once the cells enter the SG layer, cell turnover in adjacent columns is tightly coordinated in a spatiotemporal manner, leading to the regular interdigitation pattern (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Epidermal homeostasis is maintained by balancing cell proliferation in the basal layer, cell translocation (differentiation) from the basal to the spinous layer, cell integration to the SC/SG layer, and cell shedding from the top of the SC as squames. Future studies are needed to explore how this balance among critical processes in the epidermal layers is regulated to maintain a constant thickness of the epidermis."

Nutrients for stratified cells are mostly supplied from the basal connective tissue via diffusion through paracellular pathways. If all the keratinocytes in the epidermis formed TJs, cells located in the upper epidermis would likely starve due to their segregation from the nutrient supply by multi-layered TJ barriers. Therefore, it is biologically reasonable that the TJ barrier is single-layered in stratified epithelia (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kubo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yoshida et al., 2013</a>). Our observations revealed that TJ formation is restricted only between SG2 cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

Further investigation on whether this characteristic interdigitation pattern is observed in the SC of other vertebrates, such as amphibians, reptiles and birds, may reveal the general applicability of the f-TKD model to cornified stratified epithelia. Other mechanisms could be involved in maintaining TJ barrier homeostasis in simple epithelia and non-cornified stratified epithelia, where apoptotic cells are extruded to the outside TJ barrier by adjacent cells that migrate into the basal side of the apoptotic cells and form multi-junctional TJs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pentecost et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Eisenhoffer and Rosenblatt, 2011</a>)."

TJ-bearing SG2 cells were shown in three different colors depending on the vertical placement of the cell. A cycle of the SG2-to-SG1 transition of a cell starts with the appearance of the tTJs and is completed by their disappearance. In our model simulation, the SG2-to-SG1 transition of a cell is demonstrated by the gradual change of an SG2 cell to a transparent SG1 cell. The transition of a cell is governed by two local rules: (1) The differentiation of a SG3 cell to become a SG2 cell is synchronized with the differentiation of the pre-existing SG2 cell to become a SG1 cell in each cell column. (2) An SG2 cell located higher than its six adjacent SG2 cells differentiates to become an SG1 cell after a waiting period that is stochastically determined with a uniform probability between 0 and 9.6 hr. This uniform distribution was chosen to best reproduce the average turnover time (24 hr), estimated from the experimentally observed cell turnover rate in mouse ear skin (<a href=\"#bib32\">Potten, 1975</a>) and the percentage of double-edged polygons (9.8%, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The average time required to complete the TJ disappearance during SG2-to-SG1 transition was set to be 2.4 hr\u00a0=\u00a024 \u00d7 9.8/100."

In our simulations, tTJs on double-edged polygons (where TJ replacement takes place) are displayed, but tTJs at vertices of single-edged polygons are not displayed for the sake of simplicity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media9\">Videos 9</a> and <a href=\"#media10\">10</a>).

The authors show that tight junctions appear with upper and lower polygons in the stratum granulosum (SG). Using observations on TJ shape and function, the present manuscript adapts Kelvin's tetrakaidecahedron to provide a very original, attractive and interesting mathematical and physical model that explains how the continuously renewing epidermal barrier can retain TJ barrier function in a single layer, the SG2, while individual cells move upward. Overall, this manuscript changes the paradigm for our understanding of how stratified cells with tight junctions continually regeneration and yet maintain barrier function. The work is logically presented and the data are reasonably thorough and convincing in support of these impactful conclusions."
