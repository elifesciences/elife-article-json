In this study, we build upon this finding to directly investigate the effects of perturbing M1 GABA and resting state functional connectivity using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a neuromodulatory approach that has previously been demonstrated to modulate both metrics. FMRI data and GABA levels, as assessed by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, were measured before and after 20 min of 1 mA anodal or sham tDCS. In line with previous studies, baseline GABA levels were negatively correlated with the strength of functional connectivity within the resting motor network. However, although we confirm the previously reported findings that anodal tDCS reduces GABA concentration and increases functional connectivity in the stimulated motor cortex; these changes are not correlated, suggesting they may be driven by distinct underlying mechanisms."

A similar relationship has also been established between GABA levels in the posteromedial cortex and the strength of the default mode network (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kapogiannis et al., 2013</a>). However, while a relationship between resting functional connectivity and local inhibition has been established in the basal state, it has not yet been shown whether this relationship holds when local inhibition has been modulated, for example, after plasticity induction. RSNs are thought to reflect the brain's intrinsic functional architecture (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beckmann et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Smith et al., 2009</a>) and variation in the strength of these networks has been demonstrated to be modulated in a number of clinical conditions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Westlake and Nagarajan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Woodward et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Pievani et al., 2014</a>).

We have also replicated the previous finding that anodal tDCS reduces GABA concentration (<a href=\"#bib26\">Stagg et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2011a</a>) and increases functional connectivity in the stimulated cortex (<a href=\"#bib21\">Sehm et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amadi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Stagg et al., 2014</a>).

There may be a number of reasons for the lack of a consistent relationship between MRS-assessed GABA and gamma oscillations. GABA MRS is likely relatively insensitive to synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> activity, more closely reflecting extra-synaptic GABAergic tone (<a href=\"#bib27\">Stagg et al., 2011b</a>). While at baseline functional GABA<sub>A</sub> synaptic activity and GABAergic tone may be related, they are unlikely to be perfectly correlated, meaning that MRS-assessed GABA and gamma oscillations should not necessarily be expected to be tightly related. In addition, although there is extensive data from animal models to demonstrate a clear relationship between beta and gamma oscillatory activity and GABA<sub>A</sub> activity, it is not necessarily clear how best to quantify oscillatory activity derived from MEG to most clearly demonstrate a similar relationship. It may be therefore, that differences in the acquisition or analysis of the MEG data mean that any relationship between gamma oscillations and GABA is difficult to reproduce using the techniques available in humans. Similarly, small differences in GABA MRS acquisition and analysis approaches may potentially impact on GABA estimates in ways that are not completely understood."

It may be that the time course of the tDCS-induced changes in GABA and functional connectivity are different, meaning that a direct comparison between functional connectivity immediately after stimulation and a later post-stimulation GABA measure would not demonstrate the expected relationship. In addition, as discussed in detail above, GABA MRS is likely relatively insensitive to synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> activity, more closely reflecting extra-synaptic GABAergic tone (<a href=\"#bib27\">Stagg et al., 2011b</a>). It may be therefore, that extra-synaptic GABA tone and GABA<sub>A</sub> synaptic activity are differentially modulated by tDCS, and hence MRS-assessed GABA is not a good surrogate marker for the change in oscillatory activity in the gamma and beta bands after stimulation, and hence long-range functional connectivity, which may be primarily dependent on GABA<sub>A</sub> synaptic activity. Alternatively, it may be that the relationship between GABA and functional connectivity is not causal and driven perhaps by another factor which we have not quantified. This seems unlikely given the evidence supporting the role of GABA in local oscillatory activity, and hence long-term connectivity but cannot be ruled out."

The expected increases in cortical excitability following anodal tDCS have been shown to be multifactorial, and certainly are driven by modulation of both GABAergic and glutamatergic signalling (<a href=\"#bib28\">Stagg and Nitsche, 2011</a>). It is worth noting, however, that the time course of GABA changes demonstrated here are broadly in line with those shown previously using paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Nitsche et al., 2005</a>). We did not acquire measures of excitability during or following tDCS in the subjects studied here. Future work could acquire excitability data over a similar time course to the one studied here using an interleaved TMS/MRI approach (<a href=\"#bib22\">Siebner et al., 2003</a>), in order to test directly for any agreement between tDCS-induced changes in GABA and changes in excitability."

As has been done previously, the amplitude of GABA peaks were corrected for the proportion of grey matter volume within the voxel (divided by [GM]/([GM] + [WM] + [CSF])), and Creatine concentrations were corrected for the proportion of total brain tissue volume within the voxel (divided by (([GM] + [WM])/([GM] + [WM] + [CSF])) All neurotransmitter concentrations reported are given as a ratio to Creatine (GABA:Cr). Mean GABA:Cr values for each time point were normalised to the average of the baseline values for that condition, and henceforth are referred to as GABA levels for simplicity.

The earlier paper showed that (1) GABA levels in primary motor cortex (M1) measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were inversely correlated with functional connectivity of M1 with other regions; and (2) anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a technique thought to reduce GABA levels, delivered to M1 led to an increase in its functional connectivity. Here the authors explicitly test the effects of tDCS to M1 on MRS GABA levels (before during and after tDCS) and functional connectivity. While they replicate both earlier findings, perhaps surprisingly, they don't find correlations between the degree of M1 GABA reductions and the increase in M1 connectivity."

It may be that the time-course of the tDCS-induced changes in GABA and functional connectivity are different, meaning that a direct comparison between functional connectivity immediately after stimulation and a later post-stimulation GABA measure would not demonstrate the expected relationship. In addition, as discussed in detail above, GABA MRS is likely relatively insensitive to synaptic GABAA activity, more closely reflecting extra-synaptic GABAergic tone (<a href=\"#bib27\">Stagg et al., 2011b</a>). It may be therefore, that extra-synaptic GABA tone and GABAA synaptic activity are differentially modulated by tDCS, and hence MRS-assessed GABA is not a good surrogate marker for the change in oscillatory activity in the gamma and beta bands after stimulation, and hence long-range functional connectivity, which may be primarily dependent on GABAA synaptic activity. Alternatively, it may be that the relationship between GABA and functional connectivity is not causal, and driven perhaps by another factor which we have not quantified. This seems unlikely given the evidence supporting the role of GABA in local oscillatory activity, and hence long-term connectivity, but cannot be ruled out.\u201d"

GABA MRS is likely relatively insensitive to synaptic GABAA activity, more closely reflecting extra-synaptic GABAergic tone (<a href=\"#bib27\">Stagg et al., 2011b</a>). While at baseline functional GABAA synaptic activity and GABAergic tone may be related, they are unlikely to be perfectly correlated, meaning that MRS-assessed GABA and gamma oscillations should not necessarily be expected to be tightly related. In addition, although there is extensive data from animal models to demonstrate a clear relationship between beta and gamma oscillatory activity and GABAA activity it is not necessarily clear how best to quantify oscillatory activity derived from MEG to most clearly demonstrate a similar relationship. It may be therefore, that differences in the acquisition or analysis of the MEG data mean that any relationship between gamma oscillations and GABA is difficult to reproduce using the techniques available in humans. Similarly, small differences in GABA MRS acquisition and analysis approaches may potentially impact on GABA estimates in ways that are not completely understood.\u201d"

This increase in cortical excitability has been demonstrated to be broadly stable from the offset of stimulation for at least 60 minutes, in line with our GABA findings here. This increase in cortical excitability occurs concurrently with both an increase in intracortical facilitation (ICF; a TMS measure of both glutamate and GABA) and a decrease in SICI, suggesting that the increase in cortical excitability seen after anodal tDCS is driven by both a decrease in GABA and an increase in glutamatergic activity (Nitsche et al., J Physiol, 2005). It is important to note that although 20 minutes of 1mA anodal tDCS has been shown to be excitatory to M1 (O\u2019Shea et al., NeuroImage, 2014) the timecourse of cortical excitability changes has not directly been studied to our knowledge and no ppTMS measures performed."

As stated above, the increase in cortical excitability is almost certainly multi-factorial and driven at least by increases in glutamatergic signaling as well as decreases in GABA.
