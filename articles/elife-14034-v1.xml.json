Using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and phasor analysis to measure endogenous retinoic acid (RA) directly in vivo, we have investigated the amplitude of noise in RA signaling, and how modulation of this noise affects patterning of hindbrain segments (rhombomeres) in the zebrafish embryo. We demonstrate that RA forms a noisy gradient during critical stages of hindbrain patterning and that cells use distinct intracellular binding proteins to attenuate noise in RA levels. Increasing noise disrupts sharpening of rhombomere boundaries and proper patterning of the hindbrain. These findings reveal novel cellular mechanisms of noise regulation, which are likely to play important roles in other aspects of physiology and disease."

Using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and phasor analysis to measure endogenous retinoic acid (RA) directly in vivo, we have investigated the amplitude of noise in RA signaling, and how modulation of this noise affects patterning of hindbrain segments (rhombomeres) in the zebrafish embryo. We demonstrate that RA forms a noisy gradient during critical stages of hindbrain patterning and that cells use distinct intracellular binding proteins to attenuate noise in RA levels. Increasing noise disrupts sharpening of rhombomere boundaries and proper patterning of the hindbrain. These findings reveal novel cellular mechanisms of noise regulation, which are likely to play important roles in other aspects of physiology and disease."

However, random variations (noise) that affect how many of these molecules are produced, how they move through the space between cells and how they bind to receptors makes the reality much more complex. Cells responding to the signal somehow can ignore this noise and establish sharp boundaries between different cell types so that neighboring cells have distinct roles in the tissue. Few studies have attempted to measure such noise or address how cells manage to respond to noisy signals in a consistent manner."

It forms a gradient along the body of the embryo from the head end to the tail end, but it has proved difficult to measure this gradient directly. Sosnik et al. exploited the fact that this molecule is weakly fluorescent and used microscopy to directly detect it in zebrafish embryos. The experiments show that retinoic acid forms a gradient in the embryos, with high levels at the tail end and lower levels at the head end."

Two cells in the same position can have very different retinoic acid levels, and the levels in a particular cell can vary from one minute to the next. The experiments also show that proteins that interact with retinoic acid help to reduce noise within a cell. This noise reduction is important for sharpening the boundaries between different brain regions in the embryo to allow the brain to develop normally. A future challenge will be to see if similar retinoic acid gradients and noise control occur in other tissues, and if the noise has any positive role to play in development."

A small hydrophobic signaling molecule derived from dietary precursor Vitamin A, RA is produced in mesoderm near the head/trunk boundary and forms an anteriorly declining gradient across the hindbrain progenitor domain, in part through the activities of RA-degrading enzymes, Cyp26s (<a href=\"#bib24\">Sirbu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hernandez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">White et al., 2007</a>). In particular, self-enhanced degradation through induction of Cyp26a1 by RA itself was shown to be critical for gradient formation (<a href=\"#bib27\">White et al., 2007</a>). Excess RA during human embryogenesis can cause anterior-posterior (A-P) patterning defects, and RA has been implicated in the development and maintenance of numerous cell types as well as in cancers (leukemia), stem cells (pancreas) and regenerating organs (cardiomyocytes) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Duester, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Tang and Gudas, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Rhinn and Dolle, 2012</a>). Due to its hydrophobic nature, RA requires proteins to bind and transport it through extracellular and intracellular space, which enhances robustness (<a href=\"#bib2\">Cai et al., 2012</a>) but also introduces various sources of noise (<a href=\"#bib22\">Schilling et al., 2012</a>)."

Here we present a novel methodology utilizing fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and a phasor analysis (phasor-FLIM) to study the abundance of endogenous RA in vivo\u00a0in zebrafish embryos. Using this new tool to visualize endogenous RA in living cells we quantify variability in RA levels and provide some of the first evidence that cells actively control the magnitude of noise in a signaling molecule in a multicellular system in vivo."

                                "text": "We took advantage of the fact that RA is a fluorescent molecule to quantify its endogenous abundance in vivo in the developing zebrafish hindbrain. Due to the low abundance of RA in cells and its wide spectra of absorbance and emission, traditional fluorescence microscopic techniques fail to detect RA specifically. We opted instead to visualize RA by its unique fluorescence lifetime, rather than its fluorescence intensity. Focusing on the presumptive neural ectoderm of mid-gastrula stage embryos (8\u20138.5\u2009hr post fertilization) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kimmel et al., 1995</a>) we used FLIM to measure the relative abundances of RA as a function of cell position along the A-P axis. This revealed that intracellular free RA forms an anteriorly-declining gradient (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>), similar to that previously reported with FRET reporters for RA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Shimozono et al., 2013</a>) and suggested by the pattern of RARE-lacZ expression in late-gastrula mouse embryos (<a href=\"#bib24\">Sirbu et al., 2005</a>). Relative abundances were calculated using phasor-FLIM (<a href=\"#bib5\">Digman et al., 2008</a>), where within the phasor space, each individual fluorescent species is represented in a characteristic and invariable position. Mixtures of molecules generate a FLIM signature that lies along a line connecting the positions of the individual component species and the position in that line is weighted according to the relative abundances (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Because we know the absolute position of pure RA (in the lower right corner of phasor space) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)(<a href=\"#bib25\">Stringari et al., 2011</a>), we can use the Cartesian distance within this space as a measure of the relative abundance of RA expressed as 1-d<sub>RA</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We observed that 1-d<sub>RA</sub> increased progressively as measurements were taken further posteriorly within the hindbrain field, suggesting that our FLIM approach is sensitive enough to detect endogenous RA gradients. An ordinary least squares regression analysis of gradient shape could not distinguish between exponential, linear, and quadratic fits, but confirmed the presence of a gradient (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Unfortunately FLIM is also sensitive to the fluorescence emitted by transgenic markers of rhombomeres or other landmarks in embryos, making it difficult to determine precise segmental locations within the hindbrain field."

Thus we next applied this technique to measure stochastic fluctuations (noise) in RA levels across the embryonic hindbrain. Our models predict that the magnitude of such noise is large (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lander, 2013</a>), as we have argued that these fluctuations help cells switch between stable states of gene expression and thereby sharpen gene expression boundaries, i.e. noise-induced switching (<a href=\"#bib22\">Schilling et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>), but direct evidence of such noise is lacking. To assess 'spatial noise' we analyzed five consecutive parallel rows of cells in which each cell within a row lies at the same A-P position within the hindbrain field. This revealed variability as high as 45% of the entire magnitude of the gradient among cells within a row (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), consistent with the levels of noise predicted by our stochastic mathematical models (<a href=\"#bib27\">White et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). To assess 'temporal noise' we analyzed the same cells repeatedly at 12-second intervals, and also found that their\u00a0RA\u00a0levels were very noisy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>)."

To address this possibility we performed an autocorrelation analysis of our temporal noise measurements using a moving window on each cell to search for significant lags. This revealed significant correlations (lags 13 and 14) corresponding to a predominant frequency on the order of 2.7\u2009min. This is significantly slower than the half-life of the RA-Crabp2a complex, which is approximately 1.7\u2009min (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dong et al., 1999</a>). Because Crabp2 helps deliver RA to its nuclear receptor, and considering the scale of noise in transcriptional activation, noise at this time scale in RA signaling could propagate downstream. Thus it seems likely that cells possess mechanisms to limit this noise propagation."

To test these candidates we reduced the amount (microinjected MOs) or overexpressed (microinjected mRNA) Crabp2a and Cyp26a1 in zebrafish embryos and measured noise in RA at mid-gastrula stages. Strikingly, MO depletion of Crabp2a increased temporal noise in RA without altering the mean RA level at a given A-P position, while overexpression of Crabp2a decreased variability in RA, again without altering the mean levels of RA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In contrast depletion or overexpression of Cyp26a1 increased or decreased mean RA levels, respectively, without altering noise. These results agree with simulations using our stochastic mathematical model in which we altered the levels of Crabp2a or Cyp26a1 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In situ Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Choi et al., 2014</a>) allowed us to quantify krox20 expression levels by manually segmenting confocal images and measuring total fluorescence of each cell (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). All HCR analyses were performed on raw 3D data, with Z-projections performed post-analysis. Either raising or lowering Crabp2a levels increased variance in krox20 expression from cell to cell (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>) when normalized for heterogeneity in gene expression from embryo to embryo, as confirmed by single embryo qPCR (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In addition, it decreased the sharpness of boundaries of krox20 expression in r3 and r5, using a sharpness index calculated as the ratio between the length of the theoretical sharp boundary and the actual measured length of the boundary (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) (Materials and methods). These results suggest that, in contrast to its effects on RA levels where Crabp2a appears to attenuate noise, an optimal range of Crabp2a is required to induce sharp boundaries of gene expression in rhombomeres and too much Crabp2a is also detrimental to the system (<a href=\"#bib27\">White et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Cai et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, either raising or lowering Cyp26a1 levels increased variance in krox20 expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Thus, while Crabp2a may play a unique role in reducing noise in RA levels it appears to function together with Cyp26a1 and potentially other RA signaling components in allowing robust expression of downstream targets."

The findings in that system indicate that due to the slow diffusion rate of the Bicoid protein, <i>hunchback</i> expression is mostly influenced by its own intrinsic noise and transcriptional noise in the <i>bicoid</i> gene does not propagate (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gregor et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Okabe-Oho et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Holloway et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, we show that noise in a secreted signal in the multicellular context of the vertebrate hindbrain influences noise in expression of its transcriptional targets. Our FLIM measurements demonstrate noisy concentration gradients of RA along the A-P axis and reveal a novel role for Crabp2a in noise-attenuation distinct from that of Cyp26a1. Crabp2a could control noise in RA levels rapidly by binding RA and facilitating its entry into cells or buffering its availability within the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib18\">Maden et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Boylan and Gudas, 1992</a>) and our previous studies have demonstrated its critical roles in signal robustness (<a href=\"#bib2\">Cai et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, both Crabp2a and Cyp26a1 inhibit noise in downstream targets of RA. Previous studies have shown that transcriptional inhibitors act as noise filters within narrow levels of expression, since outside of this range, transcriptional noise in their target genes increases (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dublanche et al., 2006</a>). Such a biphasic response resembles our results with Crabp2a and Cyp26a1. Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) often act as transcriptional repressors until they bind RA. Thus Crabp2a and Cyp26a1 may modulate noise in RA targets by altering this balance between activation and repression. As such, both must be present within a narrow optimal range (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dublanche et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">White and Schilling, 2008</a>). These mechanisms are likely to be similar in other signaling systems and critical for embryonic development and adult physiology, as well as defective in human diseases."

Rather than using the traditional intensity of fluorescence to analyze microscopic samples, FLIM measures the lifetime fluorescence decay of the fluorophore. Fluorophores possess a characteristic lifetime of fluorescence that represents the time that takes an excited electron to relax back to its basal state emitting a photon. This technique eliminates most sources of noise present in intensity-based fluorescence microscopy techniques. This is due to the fact that most sources of noise, like thermal flickering or dark current have no lifetimes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Colyer et al., 2008</a>). However photon shot noise remains a source of uncertainty, but this is inversely proportional to the square-root of the fluorescence signal intensity. FLIM also requires a high numerical aperture objective (40X/NA 1.2), which intrinsically has a short working distance, making it impossible to perform the measurements at lower magnification."

In addition, because each molecular species is represented in a defined area of the phasor space, it allows analysis of samples with multiple fluorescent species (<a href=\"#bib5\">Digman et al., 2008</a>). Individual fluorescent molecules have a constant lifetime, independent of concentration. Because the phasor space operates linearly, analysis of relative concentrations of fluorophores in samples with complex mixes can be performed. Samples with complex mixtures of fluorescent molecules generate a FLIM signature in the phasor plot that corresponds to the linear combination of the positions of the individual fluorescent species in a weighted manner. By calculating the Cartesian distance in the phasor space one can calculate the relative contributions of the different constituents (<a href=\"#bib5\">Digman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Stringari et al., 2011</a>)."

The embryos were then divided into five experimental groups and injected with Crabp2a morpholinos (MOs), Crabp2a-Myc mRNA, Cyp26a1 MOs, Cyp26a1-Myc mRNA or 500 pl of water (WT). Embryos were incubated at 28C in EM until 11\u2009hr postfertilization. Embryos were then treated as previously\u00a0described (<a href=\"#bib3\">Choi et al., 2014</a>). Briefly, embryos were dechorionated and fixed with fresh 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C for 16\u2009hr, washed in PBS and dehydrated with methanol for 1\u2009hr followed by graded rehydration. Embryos were then pre-hybridized at 45\u00b0C for 30\u2009min in hybridization buffer. Embryos were hybridized in hybridization buffer containing 1 pmol of each of 5 (five) different DNA probes designed against Krox20 containing the B1 double initiator arms and Hoxb1a containing the B2 double initiator arms (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) at 45\u00b0C for 16\u2009hr. Probe specificity was verified by blast search and controlled by adding the hairpins but no initiator probe, which showed no non-specific signal, as well as single probe experiments. Excess probe was removed and embryos were gradually buffer exchanged to 5xSSCT and washed in 5xSSCT for 3.75\u2009hr at 45\u00b0C. Samples were then pre-amplified in amplification buffer for 30\u2009min at room\u00a0temperature\u00a0(RT) after which they were left to amplify in amplification buffer containing B1H1 and B1H2 snap-cooled hairpins conjugated to Alexa 594 and B2H1 and B2H2 snap-cooled hairpins conjugated to Alexa 647 at room temperature for 16\u2009hr. Finally the embryos were washed in 5xSSCT and counterstained with DAPI before mounting in soft agar on number 1.5 thickness coverslips for confocal imaging. Samples were imaged with a Leica SP8 scanning confocal microscope acquiring z-stacks covering the entire hindbrain as 12 bit 512 X 512 images and analyzed using ImageJ software. Experiments were performed with 12 embryos per condition and repeated 4 (four) times. Microscope settings were kept constant throughout. Mean intensity values obtained from HCR experiments were of 190000 for the WT embryos, with an average cell size of 85 pixels, making the average signal 50% of the maximum."

This can easily be fixed with more description in the Introduction and a revision of the wording. However, what is troubling here is that the authors appear to move back and forth between two distinctly different tissue architectures (neural ectoderm (2D) vs hindbrain (3D) in their measurements of RA concentration and noise levels.

Unfortunately, the authors completely under-utilize this method and this brings their data and conclusion into question. That is, the HCR images (z-projections) are over-exposed and should be of high enough quality to present an accurate 3D spatial representation of the subregions near presumptive rhombomere boundaries (instead of reducing to a 2D analysis and segmentation that does not include the cell membrane outlines as a 3D volume). Further, this conclusion really begs for single cell resolution at the presumptive rhombomere boundaries which is not clear.

Determining relative intensities using HCR can be complicated by several factors that contribute to background signals (ACS Nano 8, 4284). Auto-fluorescence (AF) in the embryos may prevent an experimenter from observing the true intensities directly in the experiments. Non-specific amplification (NSA) of hairpins and non-specific detection (NSD) of the targets can also corrupt the true signal measurement.

We appreciate the importance of the more detailed spatial and temporal analyses requested both by reviewers and editors (Editor\u2019s comments #1) and we have addressed these experimentally and/or computationally where possible. However, as we explain below there are no morphological landmarks of individual rhombomeres at the stages when most of our measurements were performed, and fluorescent transgenes that mark rhombomeres at late gastrula stages (when segments are sharpening) interfere with the RA emission and therefore with the FLIM measurements. The FLIM technique is based on spontaneous autofluorescence of RA and any fluorescent marker will strongly perturb the basic FLIM- phasor fluctuation analysis. We have clarified these limitations of the technique in the text, and we have managed to perform a more detailed analysis of gradient shape with additional FLIM and computational analyses, as requested (Editors comment #2). We also now include data to address concerns regarding quantification of the HCR data in 3D and at the level of single cells (Editors comment #3), as well as the lack of controls for these experiments (Reviewer 3, major comment #1). Overall, the reviewers agree that these are novel findings that improve our understanding about the function of morphogen gradients and an understudied dimension of cell signaling.

Choi et al. 2014 (ACS Nano 8, 4284) is the most relevant paper since it describes the use of DNA probes to detect RNA targets and describes the method followed by the authors. However, the Choi paper does not demonstrate HCR's capability of doing relative (or absolute) quantification of target mRNAs. Choi et al. compared signal intensities and signal-to-background between one- and two-initiator probes using multiplex approaches. Thus, the authors\u2019 claim of using HCR for the relative quantification of target mRNAs is novel and important and thus requires a higher burden of proof that it is indeed quantitative. The basic experimental framework put forth by the authors is based upon the idea of imaging the HCR signals from the tissue/embryonic region of interest (hindbrain r3-5) and examining whether HCR provides a quantitative readout of relative mRNA abundance within single cells for a statistically significant number of image sets. Determining relative intensities using HCR can be complicated by several factors that contribute to background signals (ACS Nano 8, 4284). Auto-fluorescence (AF) in the embryos may prevent an experimenter from observing the true intensities directly in the experiments. Non-specific amplification (NSA) of hairpins and non-specific detection (NSD) of the targets can also corrupt the true signal measurement. All of these controls were presumably run by the authors and would be valuable additions to the paper.</i> "
