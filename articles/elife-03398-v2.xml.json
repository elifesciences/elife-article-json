The anaphase B spindle in fission yeast has a slender morphology and must elongate against compressive forces. This \u2018pushing\u2019 mode of chromosome transport renders the spindle susceptible to breakage, as observed in cells with a variety of defects. Here we perform electron tomographic analyses of the spindle, which suggest that it organises a limited supply of structural components to increase its compressive strength. Structural integrity is maintained throughout the spindle's fourfold elongation by organising microtubules into a rigid transverse array, preserving correct microtubule number and dynamically rescaling microtubule length."

The anaphase B spindle in fission yeast has a slender morphology and must elongate against compressive forces. This \u2018pushing\u2019 mode of chromosome transport renders the spindle susceptible to breakage, as observed in cells with a variety of defects. Here we perform electron tomographic analyses of the spindle, which suggest that it organises a limited supply of structural components to increase its compressive strength. Structural integrity is maintained throughout the spindle's fourfold elongation by organising microtubules into a rigid transverse array, preserving correct microtubule number and dynamically rescaling microtubule length."

The spindle also has a striking geometric pattern. In the spindle midzone, microtubules are ordered into a highly regular square-packed array, while the rest of the spindle contains microtubules arranged hexagonally. This hexagonal arrangement maximizes the interactions between a microtubule and its neighbors, which makes the spindle stronger and prevents it from buckling under the physical forces that act on it. Engineers have incorporated this type of design in man-made structures for decades. A future challenge is to explain how the properties of the spindle components have been tuned to be able to always assemble into a structure with such reliable properties."

This complexity is compounded by the substantial morphological and temporal variability that often exists between different cells of the same type. Another complication is that the spindle is usually involved in performing multiple interrelated functions in the cell at any one time. During prometaphase, for example, the spindle must simultaneously capture mitotic chromosomes and form a bipolar structure (<a href=\"#bib80\">Walczak and Heald, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Glotzer, 2009</a>). We chose the anaphase B spindle in fission yeast as a model system to address the relationship between spindle form and function as it circumvents many of these conceptual difficulties."

This enables the dynamics of mitosis to be related directly to the comprehensive, nano-scale reconstructions of the spindle architecture that can be acquired using electron tomography. A second advantage is that anaphase B spindle elongation represents a clearly defined morphogenetic transition that is driven by outward sliding of overlapping microtubules by plus-end directed molecular motors located at its centre (<a href=\"#bib77\">Toli\u0107-N\u00f8rrelykke, Sacconi, et al., 2004b</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Khodjakov et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Glotzer, 2009</a>).

This procedure enabled us to determine the spindles' contour length and to investigate the transverse organisation of microtubules (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). A visualisation of the IFTA results (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) reveals that microtubules at the spindle midzone form arrays with a degree of square-packed order from late metaphase onwards. We frequently observe square arrays containing a 3 \u00d7 3 \u2018checkerboard\u2019 arrangement of microtubules at the midzone of spindles from the end of metaphase and early in anaphase B, whilst all of the later spindles contain at least four microtubules arranged as the vertices of a square. The polar regions of the spindle are loosely packed in metaphase but become more tightly packed in anaphase B, where we observe three microtubules arranged in an equilateral triangle motif in all of the reconstructed spindles."

An analysis of the lengths of microtubules with respect to the spindle's contour length (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) shows that the microtubule overlap spans across the spindle in metaphase.

The ET shows that the spindle contains around thirty microtubules during metaphase, and that this number is reduced dramatically by kinetochore-fibre depolymerisation in anaphase A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Upon entry into anaphase B, the spindle is constructed from only ten microtubules, which are then lost progressively from the spindle until only six remain prior to its disassembly. Concomitant with the changes in microtubule number, the total microtubule length polymerised within the spindle peaks at around 30 \u03bcm at the end of metaphase, but then remains roughly constant in anaphase B as the spindle length increases by a factor of four (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). This result was confirmed by live-cell imaging, which indicated that the intensity of the GFP-labelled tubulin incorporated into the spindle also plateaus shortly after the metaphase-to-anaphase transition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1 and 2</a>).

Since all microtubule dynamics occur at the plus-tips of spindle microtubules during anaphase B (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mallavarapu et al., 1999</a>), the conservation of polymer mass suggests that microtubule depolymerisation and recycling of tubulin subunits into the free pool (<a href=\"#bib81\">Walker et al., 1988</a>) may be required for growth of the surviving interpolar microtubules, as suggested by previous EM reconstructions of fission yeast cells containing the cdc25.22 mutation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ding et al., 1993</a>).

These two-dimensional slices are then registered and used to approximate the full three-dimensional object. The main disadvantage of this technique is that movements of the microtubules perpendicular to the imaging plane cannot be fully accounted for, which can cause straightening of microtubules during the registration step. The technique provides accurate estimates of microtubule length and transverse organisation in linear microtubule bundles, but it may be impossible to track strongly curved microtubules, which, by definition, have an orientation that varies along their length. These difficulties are largely overcome by electron tomography where the sample is imaged at numerous orientations (i.e. a tilt series) with respect to the imaging plane (<a href=\"#bib71\">Soto et al., 1994</a>)."

In both genetic backgrounds, the spindle is highly symmetric from late metaphase onwards with an almost identical number of microtubules nucleated from each spindle pole (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The total length of tubulin polymerised in spindle microtubules also appears to remain constant throughout anaphase B, in both conditions, which is accommodated by a gradual reduction in microtubule numbers. The most striking difference is that cdc25.22 spindles contain around twice the quantity of polymerised tubulin. The likely cause for this discrepancy is the cdc25.22 mutation, which causes the allele of the mitotic phosphatase cdc25p to be inactivated by high temperature (<a href=\"#bib65\">Russell and Nurse, 1986</a>). The cdc25.22 allele is hypomorphic under the permissive temperatures used by Ding et al., and consequently cells divide at lengths that are around twice that of wild-type cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hagan et al., 1990</a>). This suggests that the increased quantity of polymerised tubulin in cdc25.22 mutant cells arises from the increased cytoplasmic volume and the corresponding twofold increase in the abundance of tubulin and other spindle assembly factors."

Square packing is present at the midzone of anaphase B spindles in both genetic backgrounds, but the tight hexagonal packing nearer the poles of anaphase B spindles was not observed in cdc25.22 mutant cells, where a more variable transverse architecture was present. These two differences could be explained by the spindle morphology being perturbed by the increased microtubule polymer in cdc25.22 fission yeast cells or the technical differences in the electron microscopy."

The mechanical response of slender elastic beams under compression can be described using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory (<a href=\"#bib39\">Landau and Lifshitz, 1986</a>), which states that a beam will remain straight if subjected to forces below a certain threshold but will buckle if the critical force is exceeded. The critical force depends on the length of the beam, the elastic properties of the constituent material (specifically, its Young's modulus, E) and the beam's cross-section (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The Young's modulus is a measure of the stiffness of a particular material.

If the beam is clamped in a horizontal position at the end furthest from view (grey rectangle), and a transverse force is applied at the other end (in this case upwards), then the beam's resistance is defined by the scalar transverse stiffness, EI<sub>xx</sub>, which is the product of the Young's modulus, E, and the area moment of inertia, I<sub>xx</sub>. The area moment of inertia can be computed by dividing the cross-section into area elements, dA, and multiplying each area by the square of their distance, y, from the neutral axis (dotted line). A sum or integration of this quantity can then be used to compute the area moment of inertia, I<sub>xx</sub>. The neutral axis is perpendicular to the applied force and passes through the centre-of-mass of the beam's cross-section. Intuitively, an increased stiffness can be achieved by placing the beam's material as far from the neutral axis as possible. This property is the rationale behind the design of the I-beam, which typically bears loads in the direction given by I<sub>xx</sub>.

We modelled the effects of these proteins by assuming they have identical material properties to microtubules and form dense bridges in the regions of overlap. The uncertainty in the cross-linker density is then modelled by varying the width, w, of the connections between microtubules (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This analysis confirms that peaks in the minimal transverse stiffness are present irrespective of the cross-linker density, and are therefore associated with the geometry of square and hexagonal arrays (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The structural motifs, such as the triangular motif, the 2 \u00d7 2 square motif and the 3 \u00d7 3 square motif that are observed in late metaphase and early anaphase B, thus appear to represent features that increase the spindle's stiffness and the force that it can tolerate before buckling."

This leads, for example, to four hexagonally-packed microtubules having a mean stiffness of \u223c21EI<sub>MT</sub> compared with the 2 \u00d7 2 motif's stiffness of \u223c34EI<sub>MT</sub>. This effect has two causes with the first being the intrinsically higher hexagonal packing density, which is 2/\u221a3 times greater than equivalent square packing. The second cause is the wider bridging distance between cross-linked microtubules at the midzone compared with the polar regions of the spindle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). Both of these effects tend to increase the separation between each microtubule centre and the bundle's neutral axis and thus increase the transverse stiffness of the midzone. Since, the bridging distance between microtubules is set by the span of the cross-linking molecules, selection for increased bundle stiffness could be one of the explanations for the relatively large size of the major classes of microtubule motors within the spindle (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carter et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Scholey et al., 2014</a>)."

These maps illustrate the decrease in the transverse stiffness that is associated with elongation of the anaphase B spindle. This effect is caused by the conservation of polymer mass, which is maintained by completely depolymerising a sub-set of the interpolar microtubules from the elongating spindle. This reduction in microtubule numbers, in turn, leads to the decrease in the spindle's transverse stiffness (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). We also observed that the square-packed architecture, larger number of microtubules and increased bridging distance between cross-linked microtubules at the spindle midzone result in a greater transverse stiffness than in the polar regions for all phases of spindle elongation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

The narrow width of these transitional regions (also known as phase boundaries) thus appears to enable fission yeast spindles to establish mechanically isotropic microtubule organisations, throughout most of their extent."

The enlarged cytoplasmic volumes and greater polymer mass in cdc25.22 cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ding et al., 1993</a>) leads to spindles that retain the nine microtubules at the spindle midzone in a 3 \u00d7 3 configuration late into anaphase B. Conversely, late anaphase B spindles in budding yeast contain around 20 \u03bcm of polymer, and are often arranged with two long microtubules emanating from each pole (<a href=\"#bib83\">Winey et al., 1995</a>), and a 2 \u00d7 2 square-packed array in the central spindle. This suggests that the mechanisms of spindle assembly that give rise to mechanically isotropic arrangements are conserved in other yeast species, and are adaptable to the increased abundance of tubulin in enlarged fission yeast cells."

Simulation results for the longest fission yeast spindle, after subjecting it to forces that increase at different rates, are shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>. These numerical experiments indicate that the simulated spindle withstands the increasing force until a threshold is reached and buckling occurs. All of the stochastic simulations were initialised in the same state and behaved identically until a force is applied. However, there are substantial differences in the peak force that can be sustained before the spindle buckles. This transient effect is a known signature of the buckling instability, and becomes more pronounced as spindles are compressed more rapidly. It is for this reason that the estimates of the critical force of the spindle architectures were determined by averaging the force in the final 50 s of the simulation when the system is in equilibrium. The responses from computational models of wild-type spindles, compressed at the same rate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), shows that the critical force decreases with spindle length."

This comparison reveals that the wild-type fission yeast spindles are substantially stronger than the random model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>); a property that also applies to the cdc25.22 and the majority of budding yeast spindles (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In spindles where anti-parallel cross-linkers are confined to a region at the spindle centre, microtubules that are too short to reach the midzone cannot form associations with a partner from the opposing SPB (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These microtubules make only a small contribution to the stiffness of the structure, and represent an inefficient use of the fixed length of polymerised tubulin, L<sub>T</sub>, that is available for building the spindle. The span of a microtubule that projects beyond the midzone region also makes an inefficient contribution to the spindle's stiffness. Maximally efficient overlap at the spindle midzone can thus be achieved by ensuring that all microtubules terminate at the furthest edge of the midzone, and have a uniform length, L<sub>MT</sub> = (L<sub>s</sub> + L<sub>m</sub>)/2, where L<sub>s</sub> is the spindle length, and L<sub>m</sub> the length of the overlap (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

This effect is most dramatic for the longest anaphase B spindles where large elastic confinements can increase the critical forces by around two orders of magnitude. This effect is caused by the critical force of laterally reinforced spindles decreasing much more slowly with increasing spindle length (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). These results are in good agreement with the theory for reinforced elastic rods (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brangwynne et al., 2006</a>), which predicts a critical force, <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mo>\u221d</mo><msqrt><mrow><mi>E</mi><mi>I</mi></mrow></msqrt></mrow></math>. In the case of the spindle, this leads to a F<sub>c</sub> \u221d L<sub>s</sub><sup>\u22121</sup> dependence, which is caused by the reduction in the effective transverse stiffness (EI<sub>eff</sub> \u221d L<sub>s</sub><sup>\u22122</sup>) that occurs as a consequence of spindle elongation. These results suggest that a small degree of lateral reinforcement, compared with the \u223c1 kPa found in interphase mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brangwynne et al., 2006</a>), could greatly increase the forces that the anaphase B spindle can sustain. The scaling law relating the critical force to the length of a reinforced spindle could also facilitate its elongation in enlarged fission yeast cells."

Furthermore, the dramatic remodelling of the spindle's transverse architecture at the boundary between the midzone and flanking regions of the spindle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>) further suggests that the cross-linkers that bind to the polar regions also form rigid bridges between pairs of microtubules. Finally, the slow but uniform rate of spindle elongation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>) suggests that the midzone-bound motors operate in a regime that is far from their stall force. In simulations of the anaphase B spindle, introducing a sufficient number of crosslinkers leads to reduced movement of the filaments at the overlap zone, and causes this part of the spindle to behave elastically (<a href=\"#bib8\">Claessens et al., 2006</a>)."

This property also applies, albeit less precisely, to the budding yeast spindle, where a lower midzone width (L<sub>m</sub> \u2248 2 \u03bcm, (<a href=\"#bib69\">Schuyler et al., 2003</a>)) enables the reduced quantity of polymerised tubulin (L<sub>T</sub> = 17.9 \u00b1 6.5, (<a href=\"#bib83\">Winey et al., 1995</a>)) to be used to form 3 \u00d7 3 square-packed motifs at the onset of anaphase, and to maintain 2 \u00d7 2 motifs up to a length of around 8 \u03bcm.

This adaptive control may be required to enable the fully elongated spindle to reach the cell poles in fission yeast cells of variable size (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hagan et al., 1990</a>). This is a property that fission yeast shares with metazoan embryos, which contain spindles that are observed to scale in size with cytoplasmic volume during early development (<a href=\"#bib21\">Good et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hazel et al., 2013</a>). However, the evolutionary pressure that has led to this property being selected in unicellular yeast cells is less obvious. One possible explanation is that the spindle has evolved to be robust to natural variations in the size of the cell at mitotic entry (<a href=\"#bib46\">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Moseley et al., 2009</a>) or noise in the abundance of different spindle assembly factors (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaern et al., 2005</a>). Another possibility is that spindle scaling has been selected to respond to differentiation of yeast cells into the alternate forms that occur during mating or hyphal growth (<a href=\"#bib57\">Niki, 2014</a>)."

This behaviour is consistent with the in vivo regulation of kinetochore attachments, where tension is used to detect chromosomes that are properly bi-oriented on the metaphase spindle (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bouck et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Tanaka, 2010</a>).

The coordination between microtubules within composite kinetochore-fibres is currently unknown but extrapolating the in vitro estimates from budding yeast to the three chromosomes in fission yeast would suggest a force in the range of \u223c50 pN.

One possible functional explanation for the change in spindle morphology is that fungal cells have evolved a stiff polysaccharide cell wall that encloses the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bowman and Free, 2006</a>). This innovation could then have reduced the cell's dependence on the cytoskeleton for providing motility and structural support, and enabled reduced expression of the tubulin and actin isoforms (<a href=\"#bib61\">Pollard et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Marguerat et al., 2012</a>). In yeast cells with a small cytoplasmic volume, the beam-like spindle morphology may have been selected to segregate chromosomes with reduced use of structural components and their associated metabolic cost to the cell. In this respect, the yeast spindle is indeed remarkably efficient, as chromosomes are transported over similar distances to those in many somatic mammalian cell types (<a href=\"#bib22\">Goshima and Scholey, 2010</a>), but with a structure that has a 1000-fold smaller volume."

The segmentation of the cells was performed using a three-dimensional region-growing algorithm (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gonzalez, 2010</a>). A seed-point in the cellular background was selected and propagated to the entire image stack, using a threshold of 30% of the mean region intensity as the voxel inclusion criterion.

Each mitotic event was then mapped to a single segmented cell that was used in subsequent analyses. The background signal was estimated by fitting a histogram to the pixel intensities in each field of view. The background signal was subtracted from the pixel intensity measurements to obtain an absolute estimate of fluorescent intensity. For each cell in mitosis, the background-corrected pixel intensity was integrated over the cytoplasmic volume to obtain a measurement of the total fluorescent intensity within the cell. Large reductions in the integrated cellular intensity were used to diagnose cells that moved significantly during the acquisition period.

Increasing the width of the window to as much as 1.53 microns did not lead to a qualitative change in the results. Pixel intensity values within the window were determined by linear interpolation to account for rotation and translation of the pixel positions with respect to the sensor array. These intensity values were corrected for the local cytoplasmic fluorescent intensity, and summed to obtain an estimate of the fraction of the cellular fluorescence that is associated with spindle microtubules."

This relationship was fit with a linear function a.x + b. The small value of b, and the relatively high coefficient of determination support a linear scaling relationship between fluorescent intensity and polymer mass. Estimates of polymer mass obtained using electron tomography and live-cell imaging indicate that the tubulin within the spindle plateaus in early anaphase. This implies that the transverse density of microtubules within the anaphase B spindle decreases linearly with the length. Since, the transverse spindle width is below the resolving power of conventional epifluorescence microscopy, a useful proxy for tubulin density is the spindle's average fluorescent intensity, which indeed declines linearly with spindle length during anaphase B (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

This calculation uses the well-defined structure of microtubules (<a href=\"#bib27\">Howard, 2001</a>) to estimate the total number of tubulin subunits within the spindle. The intensity ratio between GFP-labelled tubulin in the spindle and cytoplasm can then be used to extrapolate this quantity to the abundance of tubulin subunits in the cytoplasm. Finally, the regular spherocylindrical shape of fission yeast cells, with a uniform radius and a well-defined length upon entry into mitosis, enables accurate estimates of the intracellular volume and thus concentration to be obtained. The estimates of tubulin abundance are in good agreement with mass-spectrometry studies (<a href=\"#bib45\">Marguerat et al., 2012</a>), and yield an estimate for the critical tubulin concentration in fission yeast that is around 25% lower than the 4.9 \u00b1 1.6 \u03bcM measured from in vitro tubulin polymerisation experiments (<a href=\"#bib81\">Walker et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Janson and Dogterom, 2004</a>)."

This parameter is set to 200 nm for tracking anaphase B spindles in fission yeast and at 100 nm for computing the histograms of nearest-neighbour distances and microtubule packing angles. The IFTA algorithm proceeds by first detecting the pole with largest number of microtubule minus-ends that lie within the threshold distance, R<sub>s</sub>. The centre-of-mass of these ends is used as the first point defining the spindle. A sphere with a radius, R<sub>s</sub>, is then centred at the pole, and used to detect the positions where microtubules intersect the ball's surface. A constrained optimisation calculation is then used to determine the point lying on the sphere's surface that minimises the mean-squared distance from the microtubule crossings. This point is selected as the second position in the three-dimensional interpolation of the spindle axis whilst microtubule coordinates that lie within the sphere are masked. This procedure is repeated until the spindle coordinates reach the opposite spindle pole. The transverse organisation of the spindle is then determined by detecting the positions where microtubules intersect a plane halfway between and perpendicular to the points that define the spindle axis."

The budding yeast spindles contain short microtubules (with lengths less than 0.5 \u03bcm) that are likely to represent kinetochore fibres that were not fully depolymerised during anaphase A. These fibres are unlikely to contribute to the structural integrity of the spindle, and account for a small proportion (7.8 \u00b1 4.7%, (S. D.)) of the total polymerised tubulin. These microtubules were therefore neglected in the spindle models. Two of the budding yeast spindles also contain pole-to-pole microtubules that cannot be unambiguously assigned to a specific spindle pole. In the first spindle (numbered 12 in Winey et al.) the two pole-to-pole microtubules are assigned symmetrically to each SPB. The second spindle (numbered 14 in Winey et al.) contains a single pole-to-pole microtubule that is assigned to the SPB with the lowest number of long nucleated microtubules."

Rejection sampling was first used to sample the area on the disk's surface with uniform probability. The Euclidean distance between a candidate point and the other microtubules was determined, and the point was only accepted if its separation was greater than the twice the steric radius of each microtubule. This process was repeated until the SPB was populated with the correct number of microtubules. This procedure set the position of the microtubule minus-ends with respect to the SPB, with the position of plus-ends and the transverse organisation of microtubules at the midzone determined by simulating cross-linker attachment and detachment from the microtubule lattice. The SPBs were confined to the x-axis throughout the simulation to aid visualisation."

When bound to a pair of microtubules, cross-linkers behave as elastic bridging elements that set the centre-to-centre between pairs of microtubules at 50 nm. The stiffness of the cross-linkers is consistent with the known Young's modulus of the alpha-helical class of proteins to which the dimeric kinesins and Map65 proteins belong. The microtubules were also subjected to weak (20 Pa) centring forces to prevent rotational diffusion of the microtubules away from the spindle axis and thus ensure that cross-links were formed between the two halves of the bipolar spindle."

After simulating the spindle for fifty seconds, almost all of the cross-linkers are bound to the midzone and the two halves of the spindle are strongly connected. Under these conditions, the cross-linkers are capable of forming the idealised square-packed arrays observed in yeast spindles, albeit with lower efficiency than we observe in electron tomogram reconstructions of wild-type spindles (data not shown). Upon completion of the initialisation step, the rate with which cross-linkers detach from the microtubule lattice was set to zero in order to probe the spindles' elastic response to increasing forces. This was effected by decreasing instantaneously the resting length of the spring connecting the two SPBs by 1 \u03bcm, and then linearly increasing the spring constant from a starting value of zero to a maximum of 240 pN\u03bcm<sup>\u22121</sup> over the remaining 150 s of the simulation. The stiffness of the elastic element was maintained at the maximal value for a further 50 s, during which time the critical force on the spindle was determined. This was carried out by averaging the forces borne by the elastic element connecting the pair of SPBs. In simulations of spindles with elastic reinforcement, each microtubule model point was confined by an elastic potential with a given degree of stiffness (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a>). The stiffness of the spring compressing the spindle poles was also increased to a maximum value of 1500 pN\u03bcm<sup>\u22121</sup> to ensure that the critical force was exceeded, but all other simulation parameters were identical.

The objective of this procedure was to sample a large number of alternative spindle morphologies to investigate the degree to which wild-type spindles are mechanically optimal. In constructing the null statistical models, the number of microtubules emanating from each SPB was sampled from a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to that observed in the wild-type spindle with the same length. The lengths of the microtubules in each random model were determined by randomly partitioning the total polymer present in the wild-type spindle between the N<sub>MT</sub> microtubules. In cases where the length of a sampled microtubule exceeded the spindle length, the microtubule was truncated to the length of the spindle with the remaining polymer used to set the length of one or more additional microtubules that were assigned to one of the two SPBs at random. This procedure increased slightly the average number of microtubules in the random spindles but ensured that the overall polymer mass was conserved. At SPBs that contained in excess of six microtubules, the radius of the circular face of the SPB was increased so that its area increased linearly with microtubule number, and that the density of microtubules on the surface of the SPB was constant."

An alternative null model would be to generate random bundles of microtubules that would be expected to form with unregulated, non-specific crosslinkers. It would be very interesting for the authors to perform such simulations to test if there is really something special about the arrangement of microtubules in the spindle, or if the same resistance to buckling would result from unregulated crosslinked arrays of microtubules."

Since the spindles are already bent to some extent, then forces on the poles cannot cause a buckling (which would only occur from a starting straight configuration), but additional forces could cause further bending. Given this, the relevance of studying how a simulated straight spindle would buckle is unclear. It would be helpful for the authors to explain their reasoning in studying buckling. It would also be helpful for the authors to comment on the observed bending of the spindle in the tomograms and explain how it relates to their studies of the mechanics of bending of spindles."

The most notable of these is associated with the angle measurements, which are defined with respect to the two nearest MTs. These triplets of MTs are not necessarily all from the same crystalline unit cell, which leads to a less uniform distribution of packing angles (and distances) being measured for the spindle. This effect partly explains the broad distribution of packing angles that are present, particularly in the earlier spindles. We agree that the transverse organization of cytoskeletal arrays is an area worthy of future study that would certainly benefit from the application of techniques from solid-state physics, but these techniques are relatively involved.

As the reviewer also rightly suggests, it is unclear how a buckled spindle could elongate at such a uniform rate in the presence of variable resistive forces. These two lines of evidence suggest that the deflections are caused partially or entirely by the standard preparation of the cell for electron tomography and that the native spindles have a straighter morphology. Live-cell imaging studies suggest that the spindles in living cells are close to straight but that pathologically large compressive forces in mutant cells can lead to buckling and the eventual breakage of anaphase B spindles.

In the revised manuscript, we now refer collectively to the triangular arrangement of microtubules at the poles of the spindle, and the 2x2 and 3x3 square arrays of microtubules at the midzone, as \u201cstructural motifs\u201d. This term is both precise and does not imply anything for the structural motifs\u2019 potential utility (see reply to major points 6 and 8)."

This should be clarified. As the spindles in the present work do not have constant cross section, it would be useful to discuss in which way the simple law F=pi EI/L^2 is affected if cross-sections are not constant. This point could be used to motivate the numerical work discussed in the Results</i>."

The expanded discussion of the stiffness tensor now explains how the anisotropy of a beam leads to deviations from simple, 1-dimensional buckling. We also note that the behavior of beams that do not have a constant cross-section is complex, which provides a valid justification for using simulations. We finally provide a more coherent link between the numerical simulations and the simple Euler-Bernoulli formula by computing the spindle\u2019s effective stiffness E<sub>eff</sub> I, from the critical forces measured in the simulation of the non-homogeneous spindles. This makes it clear to the reader that, although the two approaches differ greatly in their realism and complexity, they are in good agreement on how the spindle\u2019s critical force scales with increasing pole separation."
