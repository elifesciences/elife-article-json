Studying the hydrozoan <i>Hydractinia echinata</i> we show that a burst of stem cell proliferation occurs following decapitation, forming a blastema at the oral pole within 24 hr. This process is necessary for head regeneration. Knocking down <i>Piwi1</i>, <i>Vasa</i>, <i>Pl10</i> or <i>Ncol1</i> expressed by blastema cells inhibited regeneration but not blastema formation. EdU pulse-chase experiments and in vivo tracking of individual transgenic <i>Piwi1</i><sup>+</sup> stem cells showed that the cellular source for blastema formation is migration of stem cells from a remote area. Surprisingly, no blastema developed at the aboral pole after stolon removal. Instead, polyps transformed into stolons and then budded polyps. Hence, distinct mechanisms act to regenerate different body parts in <i>Hydractinia</i>. This model, where stem cell behavior can be monitored in vivo at single cell resolution, offers new insights for regenerative biology."

Classical work on the freshwater polyp <i>Hydra</i> has shown that both head and foot regeneration can occur without a significant contribution from cell proliferation (i.e., through morphallaxis) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Park et al., 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Marcum and Campbell, 1978a</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">1978b</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cummings and Bode, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">D\u00fcbel and Schaller, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Holstein et al., 1991</a>). In planarians, by contrast, proliferation of pluripotent stem cells (called neoblasts) and formation of a mass of undifferentiated cells (called blastema) are required for head, tail, and pharynx regeneration (<a href=\"#bib45\">Reddien and Sanchez Alvarado, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bagu\u00f1\u00e0, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Reddien, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adler et al., 2014</a>). The establishment of a blastema in regeneration has been observed in other taxa including annelid worms (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bely, 2014</a>) and echinoderms (<a href=\"#bib6\">Candia Carnevali, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kondo and Akasaka, 2010</a>), but the nature of the cells involved is unclear. Urodele amphibians are the only vertebrate tetrapods that can regenerate amputated limbs as adults. They are similar to planarians in their requirement for cell proliferation and blastema formation to complete regeneration, but the cellular source for urodele regeneration is different. In newts, dedifferentiation of cells in the stump provides progenitor cells, but in the axolotl, resident stem cells fulfill the same task (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sandoval-Guzman et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, amphibian blastema cells are lineage restricted rather than being pluripotent (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kragl et al., 2009</a>)."

One possible explanation for these observations is that the basic genetic toolkit for regeneration is primitive and present in all animals, but that modulation or loss of some components can modify the ability of a given taxon to regenerate. This has recently been shown to be the case in planarians where changes in canonical Wnt signaling underlie differences in regenerative ability between closely related species (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sikes and Newmark, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Umesono et al., 2013</a>). Hence, studying regeneration in a broad variety of animal models might reveal both regeneration mechanisms that are primitive and widely shared among animals as well as evolutionarily derived ones and could assist in addressing a major question in regenerative medicine, namely why humans are not capable of regenerating many tissues."

Indeed, <i>Hydractinia</i> is easy to culture in the lab and allows whole mount gene expression analysis, cellular analyses, transgenesis, and gene knockdown (<a href=\"#bib39\">Plickert et al., 2012</a>). The animal reproduces sexually on a daily basis, but also grows clonally by elongation of gastrovascular tubes, called stolons, and asexual budding of new polyps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Finally, they are small and optically translucent, and post-metamorphic animals are sessile and can grow on microscope slides enabling in vivo imaging of cellular processes. Like many cnidarians, <i>Hydractinia</i> displays a remarkable regenerative ability and growth plasticity, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these capabilities are not well understood. We have studied both oral (i.e., head) and aboral (i.e., stolon) regeneration in <i>Hydractinia</i> and show that stem cell migration and proliferation underlie head regeneration in this animal. Surprisingly, stolon regeneration is achieved through a fundamentally different cellular and morphogenetic process, demonstrating that a single species can apply different mechanisms to regenerate different tissues or body parts."

For this, polyps were isolated from their colony by a transverse cut close to the polyp-stolon boundary and decapitated (n &gt; 300; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The remaining cylinder-like body column was then followed until a new head developed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and the animals regained the ability to feed. Lesion closure by stretching out of epidermal epithelial cells occurred at both cut ends within 6 hr following decapitation in all cases. No further development occurred at the aboral end where the stolons were removed (see section below). About 24 hr later, a dome-like tissue appeared at the oral pole. This was followed by the development of a new mouth and tentacles 48\u201396 hr post decapitation (in over 95% of cases; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Anti-acetylated tubulin antibody staining confirmed that the nervous system had completely regenerated with both neurons and nematocytes (cnidarian-specific mechanosensory/effector cells) appearing normal as in control animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a>). The polyps regained the ability to catch prey about two to 3 days post decapitation when a new head fully formed, but tentacle elongation sometimes continued for an additional few days. The time course of head regeneration (n &gt; 300) was variable among polyps, lasting between 1 and 4 days, depending on age (young post metamorphosis animals may regenerate faster), genetic background (we use a polymorphic wild type laboratory population), and general state of health (malnourished or otherwise unhealthy animals may display delayed regeneration). No indications for stolon regeneration were observed within the time course of head regeneration. Regeneration of decapitated polyps that remained attached to their colonies was indistinguishable from isolated polyps within the natural variability stated above."

We therefore decided to analyze cell proliferation in <i>Hydractinia</i> head regeneration. In intact <i>Hydractinia</i> polyps, cell proliferation was almost exclusively restricted to a band at the lower part of the polyp body column, with little or no proliferating cells outside of this band. This was shown with both EdU incorporation as well as anti-phospho-Histone 3 (pH3) antibody labeling to visualize mitotic cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We then decapitated polyps and allowed them to regenerate. During the course of regeneration, we incubated the polyps in EdU for 40 min at different times following decapitation. Animals were immediately fixed and processed for EdU visualization or anti pH3 staining. These experiments showed, first, that wound closure was not associated with enhanced cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, a striking shift in the spatial distribution of cycling cells was evident 24\u201348 hpd (hours post-decapitation). In contrast to the lower body column band-fashion distribution of cycling cells in intact polyps, the post decapitation distribution of cycling cells concentrated at the oral pole where the new head was about to form (n = 100; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Intact polyps that were labeled by EdU while still connected to their stolonal network showed the same pattern of S-phase cell distribution as polyps with intact heads isolated from their colonies (n = 20; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Hence, head but not stolon amputation in <i>Hydractinia</i> is followed by the formation of a blastema with highly proliferative cells."

For this, we decapitated animals and 24 hr later macerated them as previously described (<a href=\"#bib10\">David, 1973</a>). We also macerated intact animals as control. Cells were spread on glass slides and stained with anti pH3 antibodies. Cnidarians have relatively few cell types including epidermal and gastrodermal myoepithelial cells, several types of neurons, stinging cells (nematocytes), gland cells, and stem cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Hydrozoan stem cells are called interstitial cells, or i-cells for short. In <i>Hydractinia</i>, i-cells reside in interstitial spaces between epithelial cells (mostly epidermal), and at a population level are thought to be pluripotent life long, giving rise to all somatic lineages as well as germ cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">M\u00fcller et al., 2004</a>). This is very different from <i>Hydra</i> where i-cells do not contribute to the two self-renewing epithelial lineages (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bode, 1996</a>). Most cell types are easily distinguishable morphologically (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2, 3B</a>). We have counted mitotic cells in intact vs regenerating animals 24 hpd in three separate experiments and found that on average epithelial cells, as identified by morphology, form less than 4% of the total mitotic cell complement, whereas the vast majority of S-phase cells are i-cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). There was no significant difference in the relative proportion of mitotic epithelial cells in intact vs regenerating animals. Hence, i-cells form the major proliferative cellular component in <i>Hydractinia</i> head regeneration, but the contribution of epithelial cells to this process through proliferation and/or transdifferentiation cannot be ruled out based on these data."

This is consistent with previous work on other animals<i>,</i> where apoptotic cells were shown to play a role in the regenerative process (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hwang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tseng et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chera et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">DuBuc et al., 2014</a>).

Animals irradiated at 300 Gy or lower did regenerate, but at a markedly slower pace (n = 30; <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Importantly, the lack of EdU incorporation showed that no proliferative blastema developed at the oral pole of animals irradiated at 500 Gy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Treatment with mitomycin C, a cytostatic drug that was shown to kill i-cells in <i>Hydractinia</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">M\u00fcller et al., 2004</a>), had similar effects, with animals failing to regenerate following treatment (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Therefore, cell proliferation and blastema formation are essential for <i>Hydractinia</i> head regeneration. This is markedly different from <i>Hydra</i> head regeneration, which can occur through morphallaxis in the complete absence of cycling cells."

Briefly, polyps were removed from their colony and were then decapitated. Following decapitation the cylindrical body columns were incubated in seawater containing 30\u201350 ng/\u03bcl double stranded RNA (dsRNA) corresponding to 200 bp coding sequence of <i>Piwi1, Vasa, Pl10</i> and <i>Ncol1</i>. Control experiments were performed with dsRNA corresponding to the backbone sequence of the pBlueScript cloning vector, which is not encoded by the <i>Hydractinia</i> genome. qPCR analysis of <i>Piwi1</i> RNAi treated regenerating animals revealed a significant reduction in <i>Piwi1</i> mRNA levels comparing to control RNAi (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Animals treated with control (i.e., non-coding) dsRNA regenerated normally. The experiments were repeated four times with 10 animals for each treatment. To address the role of these genes in i-cell proliferation, we treated regenerating animals with dsRNA as described above. Twenty-four hours after decapitation we incubated them in EdU for 20 min followed by fixation and EdU visualization. We found that knockdown of <i>Piwi1, Vasa, Pl10,</i> or <i>Ncol1</i> had no visible effect on cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). In these RNAi animals the head blastema formed normally yet regeneration was significantly affected, suggesting that these genes are required for differentiation. The specificity of the RNAi treatment was further confirmed by knockdown of histones H2A or H4 which strongly reduced EdU incorporation in regenerating animals (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Hence, <i>Piwi1, Pl10,</i> and <i>Vasa</i> expression is not required for i-cell proliferation and for the formation of the head blastema. <i>Ncol1</i>, which is a nematogenesis marker, is not expressed in cycling i-cells and its downregulation is therefore not expected to affect S-phase cells."

In fully grown, intact animals, i-cells are more or less restricted to the band area in the lower polyp body column, and are nearly absent from the head, which also does not include significant numbers of proliferating cells (n = 75/83). We therefore reasoned that in the near absence of resident stem cells in the intact head (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), the source of stem cells in the head blastema could either be migration, that is, i-cells moving from the band in the lower polyp body column, or dedifferentiation of local differentiated cells in the stump. To discriminate between these two options, we performed two types of experiments. First, we pulse-labeled intact polyps with EdU for 60 min, followed by decapitation. The animals were intensively washed to remove EdU and left to initiate head regeneration. They were fixed and processed for EdU visualization at 6 and 24 hpd. We found that animals fixed 6 hpd had a strong signal in the band at the lower body column and only a few EdU<sup>+</sup> cells were scattered at more oral positions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). However, those animals fixed 24 hpd had also a strong EdU signal in the developed blastema (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Because no EdU could be incorporated after washing the animals, the EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the blastema must have been the very same cells that were in S-phase in the lower band 24 hr earlier and had migrated to the stump following decapitation. Analysis of pH3 immunoreactivity in EdU pulse chased animals revealed double positive cells in the blastema, indicating that S-phase cells in the band continued to proliferate even after reaching the stump and contributed new cells to the blastema through mitosis (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Because genomic integration does not occur in all cells, the animals were mosaics and not all <i>Piwi1</i><sup>+</sup> i-cells expressed GFP.

Polyps, or even fragments of them, can, instead, transform into stolons but this phenomenon is not well understood (<a href=\"#bib41\">Putnam Hazen, 1902</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">M\u00fcller et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lange and M\u00fcller, 1991</a>). To study aboral, that is, stolon, regeneration we removed polyps from their colony by a transverse cut at the lower third of the polyp body column to exclude any stolonal tissue. Isolated polyps healed the cut surface within hours (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We then followed the polyps and photographed them every 24 hr for up to 25 weeks. The polyps appeared normal for days and sometimes weeks, responded to mechanical stimuli by contraction, and were able to catch, kill, and ingest brine shrimp nauplii, resembling a solitary <i>Hydra</i> polyp. No blastema developed at the aboral pole after stolon removal, and the general distribution of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells was largely similar to polyps that were labeled on their colony. (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Over the next weeks, however, the polyps started resorbing their tentacles and thereby lost the ability to feed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Next, the entire head structure disappeared and each polyp's cylindrical body column started to elongate, thereby decreasing its diameter (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). New branches appeared at irregular intervals and some developed into polyps with fully functional heads and tentacles, thereby regaining the ability to feed (n = 200; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Chitin secretion (which is stolon specific in <i>Hydractinia</i>) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lange and M\u00fcller, 1991</a>) commenced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and eventually, sexual polyps developed and produced fertile gametes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Based on chitin secretion and ability to generate polyps, it appeared that the polyp body column had transformed into stolons rather than regenerated new stolons from the aboral stump."

We found that polyp heads that were losing their tentacles had also lost <i>Wnt3</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). By contrast, <i>Wnt3</i> mRNA reappeared in the oral tip of new polyps budding from this newly transformed tissue (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>).

In stolons, by contrast, i-cells were equally distributed in the epidermal interstices along the stolon flanks (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Thereafter, we monitored the migration of stem cells (i-cells) from their normal position in the band area at the lower polyp body column to the prospective head, and their proliferation to form a head blastema. Of note, our data show that not all i-cells migrate to the stump, consistent with migratory vs non-migratory i-cell sub-populations. New head structures developed within 2\u20133 days, after which most i-cells disappeared from the head area and resumed their normal position in the band. Gamma irradiation abolished blastema formation and regeneration altogether. By contrast, individual knockdown of each one of the i-cell genes <i>Piwi1, Vasa</i> and <i>Pl10,</i> and the early nematogenesis marker <i>Ncol1</i> did not prevent blastema formation, but did inhibit regeneration. Hence, the role of these genes might be related to the ability of i-cells to differentiate rather than to keeping them undifferentiated. Similar results were obtained with <i>Smedwi2</i> (a <i>Piwi</i> homologue) knockdown in planarians (<a href=\"#bib44\">Reddien et al., 2005</a>), but knocking out a different stem cell gene, <i>Sox2</i>, in axolotl inhibits proliferation of neural progenitors (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fei et al., 2014</a>)."

Our results support the new emerging view on head regeneration in the Cnidaria and are consistent with Passamaneck and Martindale's hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib38\">Passamaneck and Martindale, 2012</a>) that <i>Hydra'</i>s ability to regenerate a head in the absence of cell proliferation is evolutionarily derived within this phylum. This scenario suggests that blastema formation is an evolutionarily primitive hallmark of distal regeneration in animals."

                        "text": "Isolated polyps were unable to directly regenerate stolons from their aboral end like they do following decapitation from the oral end, consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib41\">Putnam Hazen, 1902</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">M\u00fcller et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Duffy et al., 2010</a>), and no blastema formed at the aboral stump following removal of the stolons (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Instead of regenerating stolons, isolated polyps lost oral-aboral polarity, and polyp identity altogether, and transformed into stolons. This process lasted for many weeks, thereby demonstrating their remarkable growth plasticity. Polyp to stolon transformation was preceded by loss of oral <i>Wnt3</i> expression and oral-aboral polarity, and acquisition of a ubiquitous, stolon-like distribution of i-cells, as opposed to the band like distribution typical of polyps. The newly transformed stolons budded new polyps and became fully functional, sexually mature colonies. These data, therefore, show that <i>Hydractinia</i> polyps possess tissue pluripotency. For now, however, we cannot discriminate between the scenarios of pluripotent i-cells vs several self-renewing, but lineage restricted, progenitors. So why do polyps not directly regenerate stolons? We suggest that tissue polarity along the oral-aboral axis prevents direct stolon regeneration. In a previous study, it has been shown that Wnt signaling promotes oral structures in <i>Hydractinia</i>, but represses stolons (<a href=\"#bib16\">Duffy et al., 2010</a>). Downregulation of <i>Wnt3</i> or <i>Tcf</i> in decapitated polyps induces phenotypes reminiscent of polyp to stolon transformation in the present study, but requires shorter time to develop (<a href=\"#bib16\">Duffy et al., 2010</a>). We show that in the absence of experimental manipulation, <i>Wnt3</i> expression and oral-aboral polarity are lost spontaneously in isolated polyps, enabling the transformation of the polyp into stolonal tissue that can bud new polyps. Possibly, <i>Wnt3</i> not only maintains oral- but also polyp- identity, and stolons develop by default in its absence. A summary of the two distinct regenerative processes in <i>Hydractinia</i> is schematically illustrated on <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>."

Some regeneration mechanisms, like blastema formation, are conserved in animals, and their modulation over evolutionary times may have affected the regenerative ability of different species. An exciting development in the study of regeneration is provided by the ability to track individual, transgenic cells in vivo using <i>Hydractinia</i> as an animal model. In vivo cell migration assays have been performed in <i>Hydra</i> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Khalturin et al., 2007</a>), but the sessile nature of adult <i>Hydractinia</i> facilitates long-term studies at single cell resolution."

This is perhaps the first time a detailed study of regenerative processes has been carried out in this marine colonial hydrozoan polyp. The authors report on the cellular and molecular processes underlying two distinct regenerative processes that take place in the same animal: 1) oral regeneration after decapitation of the head of the polyps; and 2) aboral regeneration when the polyps are detached at their aboral pole from the colony. An important aspect of this work is the establishment that <i>Piwi</i>-expressing i-cells migrate from the i-cell belt to the anterior amputation plane to participate in regeneration. The authors pioneer live imaging of the i-cells in <i>Piwi</i>:GFP transgenic reporters to establish this phenomenon. They also use irradiation to establish that proliferative cells are required for regeneration in <i>Hydractinia</i>. In addition they use RNAi of several stem cell associated factors and show that while EdU incorporation does not seem to be affected, regeneration is suppressed. This work is a major step in the dissection of molecular processes underlying regeneration in cnidarians. As such, we would like the authors to fully address the following comments:"

Similarly results shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> could be more precise, as deduced from the combination of EDU pulse chase labeling to PH3 detection that could provide a temporal analysis of the contribution of cycling cells in blastema formation. In fact the pattern of cycling cells on detached but intact polyps appears variable, in some cases forming a clear and unique band relatively low along the body column with sharp boundaries (as in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), while in other cases, it appears rather spread all along the body column of the polyps as shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a> (panels B and C). As this band pattern is quite important in the blastema formation mechanism proposed by the authors, this variability should be quantified and discussed by the authors. Chiefly, we would like to see a more rigorous quantification of the cell cycle parameters measured during regeneration."

We would like to suggest that the authors monitor the appearance of epithelial markers in cells that are still GFP positive at the protein level but no longer at the transcript level. That way the authors could show that i-cells from the blastema differentiate into epithelial cells when the <i>Piwi</i> promoter becomes inactive. To get this result, the GFP protein should persist at least one or two days after transcripts disappear, that way the <i>Piwi</i>:GFP(+) i-cells would lose their interstitial GFP signature at the time they gain the epithelial one."

By contrast, very young polyps (i.e. shortly post metamorphosis) may regenerate an amputated head even faster, perhaps because at this stage they contain many more i-cells than fully grown ones. We have added some clarification statements to the text to address this point (in the first Results section)."

However, fully-grown polyps generally display a clear proliferation \u2018band\u2019 at the lower polyp body column, co-localizing with cells expressing stem cells associated genes. The width of the \u2018band\u2019 is variable, but cycling cells are only rarely observed in the head area or tentacles. As requested, we have now quantified it in an additional experiment and found that over 90% of all randomly selected polyps had displayed this pattern of proliferating cells.

Therefore, demonstrating that <i>Piwi1</i>+ i-cells can give rise to epithelial cells would not constitute a major scientific novelty in our opinion. In the regenerative context, however, we agree that we cannot exclude that epithelial cell proliferation and/or transdifferentiation had also contributed to the new head. Unfortunately, in the absence of a verified, exclusive marker for <i>Hydractinia</i> epithelial cells we are, at present, unable to perform the suggested experiments. Furthermore, we feel that the question of possible contribution of differentiated epithelial cells to head regeneration is not central to the point we are making in our paper. We have therefore toned-down our statement on the role of epithelial cells in head regeneration in the manuscript and hope to address this question in a future study."
