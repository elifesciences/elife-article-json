Adipogenic signals activate early adipogenic activators and facilitate the transient formation of early enhanceosomes at target genes. These enhancer regions are subsequently inherited by late enhanceosomes. PPAR\u03b3 is one of the late adipogenic activators and is known as a master regulator of adipogenesis. However, the factors that regulate PPAR\u03b3 expression remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that a novel ubiquitin E3 ligase, tripartite motif protein 23 (TRIM23), stabilizes PPAR\u03b3 protein and mediates atypical polyubiquitin conjugation. TRIM23 knockdown caused a marked decrease in PPAR\u03b3 protein abundance during preadipocyte differentiation, resulting in a severe defect in late adipogenic differentiation, whereas it did not affect the formation of early enhanceosomes. Our results suggest that TRIM23 plays a critical role in the switching from early to late adipogenic enhanceosomes by stabilizing PPAR\u03b3 protein possibly via atypical polyubiquitin conjugation."

Adipogenic signals activate early adipogenic activators and facilitate the transient formation of early enhanceosomes at target genes. These enhancer regions are subsequently inherited by late enhanceosomes. PPAR\u03b3 is one of the late adipogenic activators and is known as a master regulator of adipogenesis. However, the factors that regulate PPAR\u03b3 expression remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that a novel ubiquitin E3 ligase, tripartite motif protein 23 (TRIM23), stabilizes PPAR\u03b3 protein and mediates atypical polyubiquitin conjugation. TRIM23 knockdown caused a marked decrease in PPAR\u03b3 protein abundance during preadipocyte differentiation, resulting in a severe defect in late adipogenic differentiation, whereas it did not affect the formation of early enhanceosomes. Our results suggest that TRIM23 plays a critical role in the switching from early to late adipogenic enhanceosomes by stabilizing PPAR\u03b3 protein possibly via atypical polyubiquitin conjugation."

If the amount of PPAR\u03b3 bound to DNA is too low, then it is unable to activate gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which cells maintain the correct levels of PPAR\u03b3 activity remain poorly understood. Watanabe et al. analyzed this process in mouse cells and identified a protein called TRIM23 that is produced in precursor cells. Cells in which the levels of TRIM23 were artificially lowered failed to mature into fat cells; this suggests that this protein is necessary for adipogenesis. Furthermore, in the absence of TRIM23, the amount of PPAR\u03b3 that occupied regions of DNA was also markedly reduced. A direct consequence of this was a decline in the expression of several genes that are required for the later steps in the adipogenesis process."

This ubiquitin tag typically marks these proteins for rapid destruction by a large molecular machine called the proteasome. Watanabe et al. found that TRIM23 also modified PPAR\u03b3 with ubiquitin, but that it did so in an unusual manner that instead prevented the proteasome from recognizing PPAR\u03b3 and destroying it. As such, TRIM23 stabilizes the levels of PPAR\u03b3 in cells."

Both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and three CCAAT/enhancer family members (\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b4) are essential regulators of adipogenesis (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tontonoz et al., 1994b</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Yeh et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barak et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Imai et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sugii et al., 2009</a>). The adipogenic program is generally composed of two steps. The first step is initiated by adipogenic stimuli that induce early adipogenic activators including C/EBP\u03b2, C/EBP\u03b4 and Kr\u00fcppel-like factors (KLFs) and lead to the formation of early enhanceosomes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mori et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Oishi et al., 2005</a>). In the second step, these early enhanceosomes induce late adipogenic activators including PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 that lead to terminal differentiation by inducing genes necessary for the characteristics of mature adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rosen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lefterova et al., 2008</a>)."

Super-enhancers are large genomic domains occupied by master transcriptional activators and mediators, which induce expression of genes that define cell identity, and are especially characterized by a large amount of localization of Mediator subunit 1 (MED1). During the early phase of adipogenic differentiation, hotspots are central constituents in super-enhancers and have been suggested to cooperate with super-enhancers to drive the differentiation process (<a href=\"#bib50\">Siersbaek et al., 2014</a>). A previous study showed that C/EBP\u03b2, C/EBP\u03b4, CREB1 and PPAR\u03b3 function as candidate master transcriptional activators in adipose tissue (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hnisz et al., 2013</a>). Of those master transcriptional activators, PPAR\u03b3 plays a central role in adipogenesis, whereas other factors cannot induce adipocyte differentiation in the absence of PPAR\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Farmer, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</a>)."

TRIM family proteins are involved in a broad range of biological processes, and their alterations result in diverse pathological conditions (<a href=\"#bib37\">Meroni and Diez-Roux, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ozato et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hatakeyama, 2011</a>).

A recent study has shown that TRIM23 mediates atypical lysine 27 (K27)-linked polyubiquitin conjugation to NEMO, which plays an important role in the NF\u03baB pathway, and this conjugation is essential for TLR3- and RIG-I/MDA5-mediated antiviral innate and inflammatory responses (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arimoto et al., 2010</a>)."

TRIM23 is dispensable for the early adipogenic program but is indispensable for the late adipogenic program. By controlling PPAR\u03b3 abundance, TRIM23 functions as a regulator for a critical link between early and late enhanceosomes."

These cells were stimulated to differentiate, and the ability to undergo differentiation to mature adipocytes was evaluated by determination of lipid accumulation using Oil Red O staining, direct measurement of intracellular triglyceride contents and determination of relative mRNA levels of adipocyte-specific genes including <i>Fabp4</i>, <i>Cidec</i>, <i>Klf15</i>, <i>Adipoq</i>, and <i>Retn</i>. Remarkably, TRIM23 knockdown significantly decreased lipid accumulation and markedly impaired the induction of adipocyte-specific genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To test whether this regulatory network is relevant to human adipocytes, we introduced siRNA into human primary visceral preadipocytes and differentiated them to mature adipocytes. Consistent with the results for mouse 3T3-L1 cells, TRIM23 knockdown significantly decreased lipid accumulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These findings indicate that TRIM23 is required for efficient conversion of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. It has been shown that most adipocyte-specific genes are PPAR\u03b3 target genes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lefterova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nielsen et al., 2008</a>). We next examined the occupancy of PPAR\u03b3 at a well-described PPAR\u03b3 target gene, <i>Fabp4</i>, during adipocyte differentiation. PPAR\u03b3 forms heterodimers with RXR\u03b1, which specifically bind to PPAR response elements (PPREs). It has been reported that PPAR\u03b3 is recruited to two PPREs located 5500 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site (TSS) of the <i>Fabp4</i> gene, and this recruitment mediates activation of the <i>Fabp4</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tontonoz et al., 1994a</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nielsen et al., 2006</a>). We found that TRIM23 depletion decreased the occupancy of PPAR\u03b3 on the enhancer PPRE at day 4 using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). It has been shown that some subunits of Mediator complex are necessary for the adipogenic process. MED14 is required for full activation of PPAR\u03b3-mediated transcription and adipocyte differentiation in vitro, and MED23 is required for the early transcriptional events during adipogenesis (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Grontved et al., 2010</a>). MED1 is also required for adipogenesis in vitro (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ge et al., 2002</a>). We tested the occupancy of MED1, one of the Mediator subunits, and found that TRIM23 depletion reduced the occupancy of MED1 at the <i>Fabp4</i> gene at day 4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). We also found reduced occupancy of Pol II at the <i>Fabp4</i> gene in TRIM23 knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). These findings suggest that the adipogenic defect by TRIM23 knockdown is caused by reduced PPAR\u03b3 recruitment and subsequent reduced transcriptional activation on the target genes."

MCE is required for expression of adipogenic proteins and progression of terminal differentiation. C/EBP\u03b2 has been shown to play a pivotal role in MCE (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tang et al., 2003a</a>).

To achieve this goal, activators recruit GTFs and Pol II directly or indirectly through binding to many cofactors. The transcription cofactors can be largely classified into two groups. The first group is composed of covalent histone-modifying enzymes and ATP-driven nucleosome remodelers to reorganize the chromatin architecture (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belotserkovskaya and Berger, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jaenisch and Bird, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Margueron et al., 2005</a>). These factors create an open chromatin environment suitable for transcription. The second group consists of general cofactors such as the Mediator complex and the SAGA complex (<a href=\"#bib58\">Timmers and Tora, 2005</a>). The Mediator complex is an evolutionarily conserved coregulatory complex that typically works in communication between activators and general transcription machinery (<a href=\"#bib35\">Malik and Roeder, 2010</a>). It has been shown that some subunits of the Mediator complex are necessary for the adipogenic process (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ge et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Grontved et al., 2010</a>)."

Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac), and monomethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me1) correlate with gene activation and increase at the <i>Pparg</i> gene early in the differentiation process, whereas dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) correlates with gene repression and decreases during adipogenesis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fujiki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tie et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wakabayashi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mikkelsen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). H3K4me3 and H3K27ac levels at <i>Pparg</i> gene increased during adipocyte differentiation, and there was little change caused by TRIM23 depletion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). There were no differences in H4K20me1 and H3K9me2 levels at day 2 between TRIM23-knockdown 3T3-L1 cells and corresponding control cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results indicate that TRIM23 does not affect epigenetic marks at the <i>Pparg</i> promoter. It has also been reported that the <i>Pparg</i> promoter is reorganized by ATP-driven nucleosome remodelers and that C/EBP\u03b2 binding is required for its chromatin opening. Therefore, we monitored chromatin opening using formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) analysis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Giresi et al., 2007</a>). We performed FAIRE analysis at days 0 and 2, and we observed increased chromatin opening around the C/EBP\u03b2 binding sites on the <i>Pparg</i> promoter at day 2, while there was little difference caused by TRIM23 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Since PPAR\u03b3 by itself enhances the expression of PPAR\u03b32 by binding to the <i>PPRE</i> at the <i>Pparg</i> promoter, we performed ChIP-qPCR analysis with a PPAR\u03b3 antibody and found that the occupancy of PPAR\u03b3 at the <i>Pparg</i> promoter was significantly decreased at day 4 by TRIM23 depletion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In accordance with the data for PPAR\u03b3, the occupancy of Pol II at the <i>Pparg</i> promoter was equally increased at day 2 but was decreased at day 4, although there was little change in the occupancy of MED1 at day 2 and 4 by TRIM23 depletion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Taken together, knockdown of TRIM23 did not affect formation of early enhanceosomes, epigenetic changes, chromatin remodeling, or recruitment of Pol II at the <i>Pparg</i> promoter during early adipocyte differentiation, but knockdown of TRIM23 reduced the formation of late enhanceosomes and the recruitment of Pol II during late adipogenic differentiation."

Both C/EBP\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 binding sites exist at the <i>Pparg</i> promoter, and PPAR\u03b3 binding sites also exist at the <i>Cebpa</i> locus (<a href=\"#bib13\">Farmer, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nielsen et al., 2008</a>). PPAR\u03b3 activates its own expression via direct targeting and/or via C/EBP\u03b1 binding to the <i>Pparg</i> promoter. If transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03b3 is directly enhanced by TRIM23, knockdown of TRIM23 should lead to decreased PPAR\u03b3 expression. This hypothesis is important to clarify a discontinuity in PPAR\u03b3 expression between early and late adipocyte differentiation. To examine whether TRIM23 mediates PPAR\u03b3 expression via the transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03b3, we measured the activity using a dual luciferase system. TRIM23 showed slight suppression of PPAR\u03b32-mediated transcriptional activity but did not show a dose-dependent relationship (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). It has been reported that the transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03b3 was modulated by SUMO-1 modification and that some TRIM proteins have SUMO E3 activities (<a href=\"#bib62\">van Beekum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chu and Yang, 2011</a>). We therefore investigated whether TRIM23 mediates SUMOylation of PPAR\u03b32. Although PPAR\u03b32 was definitely SUMOylated in cells, TRIM23 did not affect this modification (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These findings suggest that changes in the transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03b3 were not critical for impairment of PPAR\u03b3 induction in TRIM23-knockdown cells."

Immunoblot analysis revealed that TRIM23 knockdown did not affect induction of early adipogenic activators but that TRIM23 knockdown impaired induction of late adipogenic activators (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Protein levels of PPAR\u03b31 and PPAR\u03b32 were already decreased at day 2 by TRIM23 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), whereas mRNA level of PPAR\u03b31 was hardly reduced and that of PPAR\u03b32 was moderately reduced in TRIM23-knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Since the amount of PPAR\u03b3 protein was more greatly reduced than the amount of <i>Pparg</i> mRNA in TRIM23-knockdown cells, we speculated that the stability of PPAR\u03b3 protein was impaired by TRIM23 knockdown. It has been reported that the stability of PPAR\u03b3 protein is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome systems (<a href=\"#bib14\">Floyd and Stephens, 2002</a>). To determine whether reduction of PPAR\u03b3 protein in TRIM23-knockdown cells depends on proteasome activity, we observed the levels of PPAR\u03b3 protein in the presence and absence of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated for 48 hr and subsequently treated with MG132. Immunoblot analysis showed that administration of MG132 blocked the reduction of both PPAR\u03b31 and PPAR\u03b32 protein levels in TRIM23-knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). We also examined protein levels of PPAR\u03b3 in preadipocytes and found that administration of MG132 blocked the reduction of PPAR\u03b3 in TRIM23-knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These findings indicated that the presence of TRIM23 is sufficient to inhibit degradation of PPAR\u03b3 not only in a differentiating state but also in an undifferentiated state. Next, we examined the protein stability of PPAR\u03b31 and PPAR\u03b32. TRIM23-knockdown 3T3-L1 cells and the corresponding control cells were differentiated by the differentiation cocktail for 48 hr, and were subsequently treated with MG132 for 6 hr and with cycloheximide (CHX) for the indicated times. TRIM23 knockdown promoted the degradation of PPAR\u03b31 and PPAR\u03b32 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). These results suggest that TRIM23 stabilized PPAR\u03b31 and PPAR\u03b32 proteins during adipocyte differentiation."

We next examined whether TRIM23 binds to and ubiquitinates PPAR\u03b32. Using immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells, we detected overexpressed HA-PPAR\u03b32 in a protein complex with FLAG-TRIM23 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). This interaction was not affected by the treatment of troglitazone (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). We also found that endogenous PPAR\u03b32 was co-precipitated with FLAG-TRIM23 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Furthermore, we found that TRIM23 facilitated ubiquitination of PPAR\u03b32 in vivo and in vitro (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>). We next examined which domain of TRIM23 was required for adipocyte differentiation. 3T3-L1 cells were infected with a retrovirus expressing shRNA for TRIM23 (shTRIM23a) or a non-targeting control shRNA (shControl) and were subsequently infected with a retrovirus expressing control or shRNA-resistant FLAG-TRIM23 deletion mutants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Expression levels of TRIM23 were verified by immunoblot analysis (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). These cells were induced to differentiate, and the ability to undergo differentiation to mature adipocytes was evaluated by determination of lipid accumulation using Oil Red O staining. As expected, even a small amount of wild-type TRIM23 expression rescued lipid accumulation; however, a larger amount of TRIM23 deletion mutants failed to rescue lipid accumulation, indicating that both an amino-terminal RING finger domain, which is a ubiquitin ligase catalytic domain, and a carboxy-terminal ARF domain were required for adipocyte differentiation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>). These results suggest that ubiquitin conjugation to PPAR\u03b3 by TRIM23 plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation."

We next examined the binding of ubiquitinated PPAR\u03b3 to GST-ubiquitin receptors and found that ubiquitinated PPAR\u03b3 purified from cells exogenously expressing TRIM23 bound less efficiently to S5a than did that from cells without exogenous expression of TRIM23. In contrast, HR23B bound to ubiquitinated PPAR\u03b3 from both cells with and those without exogenous expression of TRIM23 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). These findings indicate that TRIM23-dependent modification of PPAR\u03b3 in vivo decreased its recognition by 26S proteasome in a manner dependent on the proteasome subunit S5a/Rpn10. It is well known that K48-linked ubiquitin chains are responsible for proteasomal degradation and that K63-linked chains are involved in various cell signaling processes, though the roles of other atypical ubiquitin linkages through M1, K6, K11, K27, K29 or K33 or mixed linkages within the same chain remain unclear (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kulathu and Komander, 2012</a>). We hypothesized that TRIM23 mediates atypical ubiquitination of PPAR\u03b3 to inhibit its degradation. We performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay using methylated ubiquitin or various ubiquitin mutants (all Lys mutated to Arg except the indicated Lys residue) to study the TRIM23-mediated ubiquitin-linkages of PPAR\u03b3. Intriguingly, TRIM23 mediated ubiquitin conjugation to PPAR\u03b3 in the presence of methylated ubiquitin and amino-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged no Lys (K0) ubiquitin (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Considering that methylated ubiquitin is unable to form polyubiquitin chains and that amino-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-ubiquitin mutants interfere with linear ubiquitin conjugation, these findings indicated that TRIM23 ubiquitinated PPAR\u03b3 at multiple sites. Furthermore, TRIM23 more efficiently mediated ubiquitin conjugation in the presence of untagged K0 ubiquitin or His<sub>6</sub>-K27 ubiquitin (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), suggesting that TRIM23 can conjugate linear and K27-linked polyubiquitin chains to PPAR\u03b3. To confirm that this atypical ubiquitination of PPAR\u03b3 is responsible for reduced recognition by 26S proteasome, we performed an in vitro binding assay using PPAR\u03b3 ubiquitinated by TRIM23 and GST-ubiquitin receptors including HR23B and S5a. Consistent with the results shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, although GST-HR23B efficiently bound to M1- and K27-Ub conjugates on PPAR\u03b32, GST-S5a poorly pulled down the conjugates (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D</a>). Taken together, these findings suggested that atypically ubiquitinated PPAR\u03b3 by TRIM23 decreased its recognition by 26S proteasome, leading to resistance to proteasomal degradation."

Therefore, we expected that overexpression of PPAR\u03b32 at an abundance that is sufficient to overcome the instability of PPAR\u03b32 protein should rescue the adipogenic defect by TRIM23 knockdown. To confirm this hypothesis, 3T3-L1 cells were infected with a retrovirus expressing shRNA for TRIM23 (shTRIM23a) or a non-targeting control shRNA (shControl) and were subsequently infected with a retrovirus expressing HA-PPAR\u03b32 or control.

The induction of early transcriptional factors, C/EBP\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b4, in TRIM23-depleted cells with ectopic expression of PPAR\u03b32 was largely rescued to levels comparable to those in control 3T3-L1 cells during adipocyte differentiation, except for sustained high expression level of C/EBP\u03b2 after day 4 (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate PPAR\u03b3 expression is essential for understanding adipocyte differentiation. In this study, we showed that TRIM23 knockdown in preadipocytes results in decreased expression of PPAR\u03b3 and a severe defect in late adipogenic differentiation. Ectopic expression of PPAR\u03b32 rescues the adipogenic defect induced by TRIM23 knockdown. Therefore, we further investigated the mechanism by which TRIM23 regulates the expression of PPAR\u03b3."

                        "text": "A considerable number of studies have shown the importance of transcriptional regulation of <i>Pparg</i> gene expression. Early adipogenic activators such as C/EBP\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b4 provoked by adipogenic stimuli induce low expression levels of PPAR\u03b31, PPAR\u03b32 and C/EBP\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yeh et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ishibashi et al., 2012</a>). Then PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 directly induce each other's high expression level that supports the maintenance of the differentiated stage (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rosen et al., 2002</a>). The binding of activators to enhancer DNA elements promotes the recruitment of GTFs and Pol II to the promoter DNA in order to form a PIC (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lemon and Tjian, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Thomas and Chiang, 2006</a>). Activators also mediate the recruitment of covalent histone-modifying enzymes and ATP-driven nucleosome remodeling complexes to the promoter to reorganize the chromatin architecture to be competent for transcription, leading to transcription initiation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belotserkovskaya and Berger, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jaenisch and Bird, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Margueron et al., 2005</a>). To elucidate the mechanism of reduced PPAR\u03b3 expression by TRIM23 knockdown, we investigated the occupancy of activators such as C/EBP\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b4, epigenetic marks by ChIP-qPCR analysis and the degree of chromatin opening by FAIRE analysis at the <i>Pparg</i> promoters. However, there were no substantial changes in these during the early phase of differentiation, and we therefore concluded that recruitment of early activators and PIC formation were not affected by TRIM23. An apparent change observed in TRIM23-knockdown cells was a decrease in the occupancy of PPAR\u03b3 and Pol II at the <i>Pparg</i> locus during the late phase of differentiation, during which PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 support the high expression level of each other through a positive feedback loop. Therefore, this change caused by TRIM23 knockdown was likely to be provoked by impaired positive-feedback regulation of late adipogenic activators."

                        "text": "We examined the expression of adipogenic activators in detail, and we found that the protein level of PPAR\u03b32 was already decreased at day 2 by TRIM23 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), whereas the mRNA level of <i>Pparg</i> was moderately reduced in TRIM23-knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We therefore speculated that TRIM23 regulates PPAR\u03b3 expression at the protein level. Although numerous studies have focused on the regulation of <i>Pparg</i> expression at the transcriptional level, information on regulation of PPAR\u03b3 at the protein level remains limited. The stability of PPAR\u03b3 protein is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, and PPAR\u03b3 is actually an unstable protein (t\u00bd = 2 hr) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Waite et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Christianson et al., 2008</a>). Seven-in-absentia homolog 2 (Siah2) facilitates ubiquitination and degradation of PPAR\u03b3 in vivo, but it is unclear whether Siah2 directly ubiquitinates PPAR\u03b3 in vitro (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kilroy et al., 2012</a>). It has also been reported that PPAR\u03b3 by itself acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of p65, suggesting that PPAR\u03b3 as an E3 ligase is critical to terminate NF\u03baB signaling (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hou et al., 2012</a>). PPAR\u03b3 forms polyubiquitin chains without a substrate using UBCH3 as E2 in vitro, while it has not been determined whether PPAR\u03b3 is autoubiquitinated or not. In this study, we showed that TRIM23 conjugates atypical polyubiquitin chains including M1- and K27-linked ubiquitin chains to PPAR\u03b3, leading to reduced binding to the proteasomal ubiquitin receptor S5a. Functions regulated by K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains have been extensively studied. Past studies have established that K48-linked chains are responsible for proteasomal degradation and that K63-linked chains are involved in various cell signaling processes. Recently, roles of other atypical ubiquitin linkages through K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, M1, or mixed linkages within the same chain have been shown (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kulathu and Komander, 2012</a>). It has been reported that E3 ubiquitin ligase Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) prevents orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 degradation through mediating its atypical ubiquitination via K6 and K27 linkage (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lin et al., 2014</a>). It has also been shown that RING type E3 ligase SCF<sup>\u03b2-TrCP</sup> stabilizes the oncoprotein Myc by ubiquitination that requires K33, K48 and K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which antagonizes SCF<sup>Fbw7</sup>-mediated K48-linked polyubiquitin chain formation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Popov et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, Ring1B generates self-atypical mixed K6-, K27-, and K48-linked non-proteolytic polyubiquitin chains on itself, whereas E6AP leads to its degradation via ubiquitination of the same residues of Ring1B (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ben-Saadon et al., 2006</a>). In this study, we showed that TRIM23 mediates atypical polyubiquitin conjugation including M1- and K27-linked ubiquitin chains to PPAR\u03b3 and that ubiquitination of PPAR\u03b3 by TRIM23 causes reduced recognition of PPAR\u03b3 by 26S proteasome. Although the detailed mechanism remains to be elucidated, these findings suggest that M1- and/or K27-linked polyubiquitin chains to PPAR\u03b3 lead to resistance to degradation via reduced recognition by 26S proteasome."

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 107: 15856-15861) and that some TRIM family proteins have SUMO E3 ligase activities (Chu, Y. et al. 2011. Oncogene. 30:1108-1116). Since TRIM23 did not affect SUMOylation of PPAR\u03b3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) and facilitated ubiquitination of PPAR\u03b32 in vivo and in vitro (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D, E</a>), we focused on identification of the type of polyubiquitin chains of PPAR\u03b3 by TRIM23. We performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay to clarify the type of polyubiquitin chain of PPAR\u03b3 by TRIM23. In this assay, we took advantage of a series of ubiquitin (Ub) derivatives including wild-type Ub (Ub (WT)), methylated Ub (methyl-Ub), Ub (K0) in which all Lys are substituted with Arg, and His<sub>6</sub>-tagged ubiquitin mutants Ub (K0), Ub (K6), Ub (K11), Ub (K27), Ub (K29), Ub (K33), Ub (K48) and Ub (K63) in which the indicated Lys alone is not substituted with Arg (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Since methylated ubiquitin is unable to form polyubiquitin chains and amino-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagging of ubiquitin interferes with linear ubiquitin conjugation, the assay using these mutated Ubs makes it possible to distinguish various types of ubiquitination including monoubiquitination, multi-ubiquitination and polyubiquitination with different chain types."

Of note, weak ubiquitination was observed with other mutants of ubiquitin including methyl-Ub, His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Ub (K0), Ub (K6), Ub (K11), Ub (K29), Ub (K33), Ub (K48) and Ub (K63), suggesting that multiple sites of PPAR\u03b3 were conjugated with these ubiquitin mutants in this assay. Thus, these findings indicate that TRIM23 conjugates M1- and K27-linked polyubiquitin chains to PPAR\u03b3 (in the subsection headed \u201cTRIM23 mediates atypical polyubiquitin conjugation, leading to reduced recognition by the proteasomal ubiquitin receptor S5a\u201d)."

To address this question, we examined whether ubiquitin conjugation to PPAR\u03b3 by TRIM23 leads to the acquisition of resistance to proteasomal degradation. Recruitment of ubiquitinated proteins to the 26S proteasome is a key step in proteasomal degradation. Several ubiquitin receptors that mediate this process have been identified. Of those, HR23B and S5a/Rpn10 have been shown to play a central role. We performed a GST pull-down assay using GST-tagged HR23B, GST-tagged S5a and HEK293T cell lysates expressing PPAR\u03b3 and/or TRIM23 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Whereas GST-S5a efficiently pulled down ubiquitinated PPAR\u03b3 in the absence of TRIM23, GST-S5a poorly pulled down ubiquitinated PPAR\u03b3 in the presence of TRIM23. In contrast, GST-HR23B pulled down ubiquitinated PPAR\u03b3 from both cells with and those without exogenous expression of TRIM23. These findings suggested that atypically ubiquitinated PPAR\u03b3 by TRIM23 decreased its recognition by 26S proteasome in a manner dependent on the proteasome subunit S5a/Rpn10, leading to resistance to proteasomal degradation (in the subsection headed \u201cTRIM23 mediates atypical polyubiquitin conjugation, leading to reduced recognition by the proteasomal ubiquitin receptor S5a\u201d)."

We agree with the reviewer and think that it is very important to show evidence that ubiquitin conjugation to PPAR\u03b3 by TRIM23 is responsible for increased PPAR\u03b3 stability. To directly address the question, it is important to clarify whether atypical ubiquitination-resistant PPAR\u03b3, in which ubiquitination sites by TRIM23 are mutated, is more unstable in cells. However, there is a technical difficulty in generating a PPAR\u03b3 mutant, since it is difficult to distinguish the sites conjugated with degradative ubiquitin chains by other E3 ligases and with proteasome-resistant ubiquitin chains by TRIM23. Instead of performing the strategy, we tested the requirement of ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM23 for adipocyte differentiation. As described in the revised manuscript (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F-H</a>), we added shRNA-resistant FLAG-TRIM23 deletion mutants back to TRIM23-knockdown 3T3-L1 cells and differentiated them to mature adipocytes. As expected, even a small amount of wild-type TRIM23 expression rescued lipid accumulation; however, a large amount of TRIM23 \u0394RING mutant, in which E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is lacking, failed to rescue lipid accumulation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>). These findings support our idea that ubiquitin conjugation to PPAR\u03b3 by TRIM23 plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation probably through increased PPAR\u03b3 stability (in the subsection headed \u201cTRIM23 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PPAR\u03b32\u201d)."

TRIM23 KO mice have been generated in Dr. Vaughan\u2019s laboratory (Meza-Carmen, V. et al. 2011. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 108: 10454-10459). It has been reported that mice lacking the TRIM23/ARD1 gene appeared grossly normal and thus far have presented no obvious pathological phenotype or histopathology of major organs, including the brain, spleen, heart, kidneys, lung, and axial lymph nodes, or problems with breeding. Fatty liver without identified cause appeared in some older KO mice. Dysregulation of PPAR\u03b3 is linked to severe insulin resistance, and reduced insulin sensitivity plays a major role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Janani, C. et al. 2015. Diabetes Metab Syndr. 9: 46-50; Than, N.N. et al. 2015. Atherosclerosis. 239: 192-202). Since we found that TRIM23 knockdown caused a marked decrease in PPAR\u03b3 protein abundance in vitro, it is possible that dysregulation of PPAR\u03b3 is one of the causes of fatty liver in TRIM23 KO mice."
