                    "text": "Many organisms lose the capacity to regenerate damaged tissues as they mature. Damaged <i>Drosophila</i> imaginal discs regenerate efficiently early in the third larval instar (L3) but progressively lose this ability. This correlates with reduced damage-responsive expression of multiple genes, including the WNT genes <i>wingless (wg</i>) and <i>Wnt6</i>. We demonstrate that damage-responsive expression of both genes requires a bipartite enhancer whose activity declines during L3. Within this enhancer, a damage-responsive module stays active throughout L3, while an adjacent silencing element nucleates increasing levels of epigenetic silencing restricted to this enhancer. Cas9-mediated deletion of the silencing element alleviates WNT repression, but is, in itself, insufficient to promote regeneration. However, directing <i>Myc</i> expression to the blastema overcomes repression of multiple genes, including <i>wg</i>, and restores cellular responses necessary for regeneration. Localized epigenetic silencing of damage-responsive enhancers can therefore restrict regenerative capacity in maturing organisms without compromising gene functions regulated by developmental signals."

Damaged <i>Drosophila</i> imaginal discs regenerate efficiently early in the third larval instar (L3) but progressively lose this ability. This correlates with reduced damage-responsive expression of multiple genes, including the WNT genes <i>wingless (wg</i>) and <i>Wnt6</i>. We demonstrate that damage-responsive expression of both genes requires a bipartite enhancer whose activity declines during L3. Within this enhancer, a damage-responsive module stays active throughout L3, while an adjacent silencing element nucleates increasing levels of epigenetic silencing restricted to this enhancer. Cas9-mediated deletion of the silencing element alleviates WNT repression, but is, in itself, insufficient to promote regeneration. However, directing <i>Myc</i> expression to the blastema overcomes repression of multiple genes, including <i>wg</i>, and restores cellular responses necessary for regeneration. Localized epigenetic silencing of damage-responsive enhancers can therefore restrict regenerative capacity in maturing organisms without compromising gene functions regulated by developmental signals."

Previous studies show that this gene is not as strongly switched on in older larvae after tissue damage.

In general, for organisms that have determinate growth, i.e. growth that ceases once a genetically pre-determined size is reached (<a href=\"#bib84\">Sebens, 1987</a>), the capacity for regeneration usually decreases with increasing maturity. For example, embryonic and neonatal mice are able to regenerate myocardial tissue following substantial damage (<a href=\"#bib25\">Drenckhahn et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Porrello et al., 2011</a>). However, within the first week of life, this capacity to regenerate is lost almost completely, and the damaged tissue\u00a0is\u00a0instead replaced by fibrotic scarring (<a href=\"#bib71\">Porrello et al., 2011</a>).

In some instances where tissue re-growth is dependent on stem cell based replacement of tissue (for review see <a href=\"#bib95\">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</a>), the loss of a stem cell population could account for the inability to regenerate. However, this explanation cannot account for situations where regeneration is not driven by a stem cell population but rather by the proliferation and de-differentiation of adjacent tissue. In these cases the loss of regenerative capacity in a still-developing organism necessitates a mechanism that selectively inactivates regenerative processes while still allowing cell proliferation and differentiation associated with normal development. Since most genes that function during regeneration also have a variety of functions either in normal development or in maintaining homeostasis in the same tissue, it is presently unclear how their expression could be regulated so as to selectively block regeneration."

Many of these studies have examined growth of the imaginal discs, larval epithelial tissues that are precursors of adult structures, such as the wing and the eye (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cohen, 1993</a>). Imaginal discs are capable of regenerating missing portions following damage (<a href=\"#bib101\">Worley et al., 2012</a>). Studies of imaginal disc regeneration were pioneered by the group of Ernst Hadorn and were mostly conducted by transplanting damaged discs into the abdomens of adult female flies (<a href=\"#bib98\">Ursprung and Hadorn, 1962</a>). More recently, imaginal disc regeneration has been studied in intact larvae by damaging portions of the disc via brief expression of a pro-apoptotic gene in a spatially-restricted manner (<a href=\"#bib89\">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Berganti\u00f1os et al., 2010</a>). Using either a genetic ablation system (<a href=\"#bib89\">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</a>), or following X-ray irradiation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Halme et al., 2010</a>), it was observed that the capacity of the wing-imaginal disc to regenerate progressively diminished during the later stages of the third larval instar as the larva approached the beginning of metamorphosis. Expression of <i>wingless (wg, Drosophila WNT1</i> ortholog) is robustly upregulated in regenerating discs following genetic ablation. However, in more mature discs, which do not regenerate, there is a strong reduction in this <i>wg</i> upregulation (<a href=\"#bib89\">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</a>)."

We show that damage-responsive activation and age-dependent attenuation can each be\u00a0ascribed to separate modules within the enhancer, and while the damage-responsive module is equally effective in promoting damage-responsive gene expression in mature discs, its activity is overridden by an adjacent element that nucleates epigenetic silencing with increasing effectiveness as the larva matures. Importantly, this epigenetic silencing is restricted to the immediate vicinity of this enhancer, thereby not interfering with the activation of <i>wg</i> and <i>Wnt6</i> by distinct developmentally regulated enhancers. We also describe a way of overcoming this silencing and improving regeneration in more mature larvae."

A pro-apoptotic gene, either <i>eiger (egr</i>) or <i>reaper (rpr</i>), is expressed specifically in the wing pouch by <i>rn-Gal4</i>, and temporally regulated by temperature-controlled inactivation of Gal80 (encoded by <i>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></i>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Depending on the transgene used, this system is hereafter referred to as <i>rn<sup>ts</sup></i>&gt;<i>egr</i> or <i>rn<sup>ts</sup></i>&gt;<i>rpr</i>. This system was used to initiate cell death early in the third larval instar (L3) on day 7 (hereafter \u201cday 7 discs\u201d) or late in L3 on day 9 (hereafter \u201cday 9 discs\u201d)(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). After 20\u2009hr of <i>rpr</i> expression or 40\u2009hr of <i>egr</i> expression, the tissue that comprises the wing pouch is almost completely ablated in both a day 7 and a day 9 disc (<a href=\"#bib89\">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</a>). However, ablations initiated later in L3 result in significantly less regenerative growth, yielding adult flies with wings of greatly reduced size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Regeneration of younger discs is associated with an extended larval stage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which allows sufficient time for tissue re-growth before the pupal stage of development. This extension is significantly smaller in ablated day 9 discs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, the decline in regenerative growth is not simply due to restricted proliferation in mature discs, as both ablated and unablated discs from day 9 discs still express markers of cell-cycle progression, albeit at a lower level than in day 7 discs (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). As suggested by the reduced damage-responsive <i>wg</i> expression in older discs, other mechanisms likely exist to limit regenerative growth."

Gal4 under the control of the <i>rotund (rn</i>) enhancer drives the pro-apoptotic gene <i>rpr</i> (or <i>egr</i> in <i>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;egr</i>) in the developing wing pouch. Ablation is repressed at 18\u00b0C by a ubiquitous temperature-sensitive Gal80 (Gal80<sup>ts</sup>), until the temperature is increased to 30\u00b0C to inactivate the Gal80<sup>ts</sup> and induce cell death. Ablation of the pouch is complete after 20\u2009hr for <i>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;rpr</i> (or 40\u2009hr for <i>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;egr</i>). The temperature is then reduced (downshift) to end ablation and allow regeneration.

                        "text": "To examine the basis for a progressive loss of regenerative capacity, we compared the morphological characteristics of <i>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;rpr</i> ablated day 7 and day 9 discs using light sheet microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). Since this technique involves embedding the specimens in agarose for visualization, the three dimensional architecture of the disc is preserved and can be accurately examined. Additionally, we used confocal microscopy to visualize the cells at the edge of the ablated region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013I</a>). The JNK signaling pathway is known to be activated strongly in regenerating imaginal discs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bosch et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Mattila et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Berganti\u00f1os et al., 2010</a>). We therefore used an AP-1 reporter (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chatterjee and Bohmann, 2012</a>) to identify the cells in which the JNK pathway was active. In both day 7 discs and day 9 discs we observed that the disc proper (DP)\u00a0epithelium in the central portion of the wing pouch had been ablated, while both the peripodial epithelium (PE) and the basement membrane underlying the DP were intact (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>). Indeed, visualizing the basement membrane using a GFP-tagged version of Viking (Vkg) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Buszczak et al., 2007</a>), a collagen that is deposited in the basement membrane, shows no lack of continuity (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). The lumen between the basement membrane and the overlying PE of each disc was filled with cellular debris, marked by the activated caspase DCP-1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>). In both day 7 and day 9 discs the AP-1 reporter was strongly expressed in the cells adjacent to the ablated portion of the DP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H\u2013I</a>), as well as the overlying PE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>, single\u00a0arrowheads), indicating that the JNK pathway is activated consistently in discs\u00a0of\u00a0both ages. However, despite the equivalent level of activation, the pattern of AP-1 expression differed between the two developmental stages. In day 7 discs the cells expressing the AP-1 reporter in the DP became flattened and appeared to migrate towards the interior of the ablated region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), leaving the majority of the debris between the PE and the newly migrated epithelium. Hence, these AP-1 positive cells could be seen clearly in basal confocal sections but not in apical ones (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). In contrast, in day 9 discs, the AP-1 positive cells at the edge of the ablated region maintained their columnar profile (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) and remained at the periphery of the ablated wing pouch (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>), allowing the debris to extend beyond the plane of the basal DP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, double arrowheads). Thus, the cellular response to damage is markedly different in mature discs compared to younger discs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J\u2013K</a>)."

As shown previously (<a href=\"#bib89\">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</a>), both <i>wg</i> and <i>Myc</i> are upregulated following ablation on day 7, but this upregulation is reduced considerably on day 9 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also compared the activity of other signaling pathways that are known to function in the context of imaginal disc damage and regeneration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013G</a>). For all genes, we examined whole-disc expression by imaging at the level of the basal and apical DP, and the PE of each disc (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). A reporter of <i>Stat92E</i> activity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bach et al., 2007</a>), an indicator of signaling via the JAK/STAT pathway, which has recently been implicated in imaginal disc regeneration (<a href=\"#bib40\">Katsuyama et al., 2015</a>), was strongly upregulated all around the ablated region on day 7, but on day 9 the expression was restricted to those regions that also express the reporter in unablated discs of a comparable developmental stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Yki activity has been shown to be increased in regenerating discs (<a href=\"#bib32\">Grusche et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Sun and Irvine, 2011</a>). The <i>bantam</i>-GFP reporter (<a href=\"#bib56\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2012</a>), which can be activated by increased Yki activity, also shows a moderate decline in expression following ablation as larvae progress through L3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The cell cycle regulator Cyclin E and a reporter of E2F activity also showed a similar reduction in ablation-induced expression in a day 9 disc (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013C</a>), indicating that the proliferative response to damage can still occur in late stage discs, but is diminished. Thus a number of damage-responsive signaling pathways show reduced activation following tissue damage in day 9 discs when compared to day 7 discs (summary, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>)."

Our observations of the AP-1-GFP reporter suggest that the JNK pathway is still strongly active in mature ablated discs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,G,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Surprisingly however, when we examined expression of <i>matrix metalloprotease 1 (MMP1</i>), a JNK target gene that is important for cell migration (<a href=\"#bib65\">Page-McCaw et al., 2003</a>) and wound healing (<a href=\"#bib90\">Stevens and Page-McCaw, 2012</a>), we found a strongly reduced response to ablation in a day 9 disc compared to that of a day 7 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This was indicated by both protein levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) and transcriptional readout by an <i>MMP1-lacZ</i> reporter (<a href=\"#bib97\">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The JNK phosphatase <i>puckered (puc</i>), another JNK target gene (<a href=\"#bib75\">Ring and Martinez Arias, 1993</a>), was also not as strongly activated in an ablated day 9 disc (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Additionally, expression of <i>DILP8</i>, a secreted protein released by damaged tissue that delays entry into metamorphosis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Colombani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Garelli et al., 2012</a>), and which is regulated by JNK signaling (<a href=\"#bib19\">Colombani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Katsuyama et al., 2015</a>), was reduced in day 9 discs when compared to day 7 discs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, while JNK activation, as assessed by a synthetic promoter with multimerized AP-1 binding sites, is comparable on day 7 and day 9, a number of known JNK pathway targets demonstrate strongly reduced damage-responsive expression in mature discs compared to younger discs. This correlates with an altered morphological response to damage and a loss of regenerative capacity. One explanation for this change in gene expression is that the damage-responsive signaling cascades that activate these pathways are less active in day 9 discs, although the AP-1 reporter suggests that, at least for JNK targets, this is not the case. An alternate possibility is that the transcriptional response to these activating signals is actively repressed by a mechanism that becomes more potent as discs mature. To distinguish between these possibilities, we conducted a detailed characterization of the mechanisms that regulate <i>wg</i> expression following damage, as <i>wg</i> is a gene whose orthologs have well documented roles in regeneration in many organisms."

Additionally, as with the full length enhancer, BRV-B is activated more strongly by <i>rn<sup>ts</sup></i>&gt;<i>egr</i> than by <i>rn<sup>ts</sup></i>&gt;<i>rpr</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013B\u2019</a>). <i>egr</i> is thought to promote cell death in large part through activation of JNK signaling (<a href=\"#bib36\">Igaki et al., 2002</a>), whereas blocking JNK signaling does not prevent <i>rpr</i>-mediated cell death (<a href=\"#bib93\">Sun and Irvine, 2011</a>). These observations suggest that tissue injury could activate BRV-B in significant part via the JNK/AP-1 pathway. To test whether activation of JNK was sufficient to activate BRV-B driven expression, even in the absence of <i>egr</i>- or <i>rpr</i>-directed ablation, we expressed a constitutively active <i>hemipterous</i> transgene (<i>UAS-hep<sup>CA</sup></i>), which encodes an active form of JNK kinase. This strongly induced the reporter expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Conversely, in <i>hep</i> hemizygotes, where activity of JNK is greatly reduced, the upregulation of BRV-B following ablation with <i>rn<sup>ts</sup></i>&gt;<i>rpr</i> is completely abolished (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013D\u2019</a> ). To test whether the requirement for JNK signaling was disc autonomous and to rule out systemic influences, discs were dissected, physically fragmented and cultured in the presence of a small molecule JNK inhibitor. These discs failed to upregulate the BRV-B reporter (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that JNK signaling in the wounded tissue itself is responsible for activation of the enhancer.

We deleted these sites in the BRV-B reporter to generate BRV-B\u2206AP1. Following physical fragmentation, discs bearing the BRV-B reporter strongly expressed GFP along the wound edges, coincident with AP-1-RFP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). In contrast, deletion of the AP-1 sites in BRV-B\u2206AP1 completely abolished expression of GFP in fragmented discs despite AP-1 activation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F\u2019</a>). Similarly, the BRV-B\u2206AP1 reporter failed to be activated following <i>rn<sup>ts</sup></i>&gt;<i>egr</i> ablation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>), or after irradiation (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that upon tissue damage, WNT signaling is activated, in significant part, by JNK signaling via the BRV-B enhancer. Consensus sites for several other candidate activators are also present in the BRV-B sequence, including Grainyhead, a transcription factor that has been shown to function with AP-1 in larval epidermal wound repair (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mace et al., 2005</a>), and the Dpp signaling transducers Mad and Medea. Several potential binding sites for the WNT pathway transcription factor TCF/Pangolin also exist, consistent with a previous observation that ubiquitously expressed <i>wg</i> can activate this enhancer (<a href=\"#bib81\">Schubiger et al., 2010</a>). In this way, <i>wg</i> could activate or maintain its own expression as part of a feed forward mechanism during regeneration. Thus, although a\u00a0high level of JNK signaling may be able to activate the enhancer on its own, under conditions of damage in vivo JNK signaling may act in concert with other damage-induced signals to activate <i>wg</i> expression via the BRV-B enhancer."

In both situations there is a loss of epithelial apicobasal polarity that results in neoplastic growth. In contrast, expression of <i>yorkie (yki</i>), the growth-promoting co-activator downstream of the Hippo pathway, for 20\u2009hr using the <i>rn<sup>ts</sup></i> system elicits overgrowth while preserving apico-basal polarity, but\u00a0does not activate reporter expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). The BRV-B reporter was also not activated in two situations where JNK is activated under physiological conditions: in the notum of late stage larval discs, which is required for dorsal thorax closure during the pupal stage (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) and dorsal closure of the embryo (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). These differences may reflect the extent of JNK activation since BRV-B is mostly activated under conditions where JNK is activated at high levels. Alternatively other factors specific to stress or damage may function in combination with JNK to modulate expression."

Thus a negatively acting element must be present in either the BRV-A or BRV-C fragments, to reduce its area of expression and to mediate a further decrease in expression on day 9. Inclusion of the BRV-A fragment to the reporter (BRV-AB) elicited a pattern of expression that was similar to BRV-B (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In stark contrast, the addition of the BRV-C region to BRV-B (BRV-BC, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) resulted in decreased expression in day 7 discs, both in the level and in the region of reporter expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Moreover, expression was greatly reduced in day 9 discs in a manner similar to the full-length 2.9 kb enhancer fragment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

We found that as more of the BRV-C fragment was deleted, there was a progressive loss of silencing, indicating that multiple regions within BRV-C contribute to this activity. However, there was a strong difference in silencing activity between deletions that retained 441 and 183\u00a0bp of BRV-C, suggesting the presence of significant silencing activity within this 258\u00a0bp region. Sequences at both ends of this 258\u00a0bp region have almost complete conservation of nucleotide identity across 12 <i>Drosophila</i> species (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), including two predicted binding sites for the transcriptional co-repressor Brinker (Brk). We generated a BRV-BC enhancer with both Brk\u00a0sites mutated but found no loss of silencing activity (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>), indicating either that Brk does not function in mediating the repression, or that its activity is redundant with other mechanisms that are still functional. Thus, unrecognized motifs, likely within the conserved blocks clustered near the predicted Brk binding sites, must mediate the silencing activity associated with this region."

For many transgenes that contain elements capable of recruiting PcG proteins, silencing of the adjacent mini-<i>white</i> gene in the transgene is also observed (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kassis and Brown, 2013</a>). In these cases, the silencing of the mini-<i>white</i> gene is sensitive to the levels of PcG proteins. Indeed, we observed that transgenic flies bearing the BRV-BC reporter had lighter eyes than those bearing the BRV-B reporter (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) even though both reporter genes were inserted at the identical site in the genome, suggesting that the BRV-C fragment was capable of mediating silencing of surrounding DNA when integrated at a genomic locus outside of the WNT cluster. However, in flies that were heterozygous for <i>pleiohomeotic</i> (<i>pho</i>) or <i>pleiohomeotic-like (phol</i>), the eye color was similar to those bearing the BRV-B fragment (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), indicating that the silencing activity induced by the BRV-C fragment was indeed sensitive to PcG group gene dosage. We examined the sequence of BRV-C and found multiple potential binding sites for proteins shown to be important for PcG silencing at PREs, including 2 conserved <i>pho/phol</i> binding sites (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). To test whether the silencing activity of BRV-C during disc regeneration is regulated by PcG, we examined the expression of the full length BRV118-GFP reporter in <i>rn<sup>ts</sup></i>&gt;<i>egr</i> imaginal discs heterozygous for the null allele of <i>Polycomb, Pc<sup>15</sup></i>. In these flies, robust expression of the reporter was observed in day 9 discs, as was expression of the Wg protein expressed from the endogenous <i>wg</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013D\u2019</a>). However, due to changes in developmental timing, increased lethality, and the significant transdetermination levels associated with the <i>Pc</i> allele, documented previously (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lee et al., 2005</a>), we were unable to test whether <i>Pc</i> gene dose affected levels of regeneration in our genetic ablation system. In order to avoid potential organism-wide pleiotropic effects of the <i>Pc</i> allele, we generated <i>Pc<sup>15</sup></i> clones in developing discs that also had the BRV-BC reporter. Day 9 mosaic discs were irradiated to induce damage and examined for enhancer activity. Despite morphological disruption within the disc epithelium, likely due to the presence of <i>Pc</i> mutant tissue, and widespread cell death associated with irradiation, GFP was clearly expressed in the <i>Pc</i> mutant clones, and to a lesser extent in the surrounding heterozygous tissue, but was absent from the wild type sister clones (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013E\u2019</a>). Thus, Pc is required to prevent damage-induced activation of the BRV-BC reporter in mature discs."

In comparison to day 7 discs, there was a significant increase in the levels of H3K27 methylation in day 9 discs, which was mostly restricted to the BRV118 enhancer (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Most of the <i>wg</i> and <i>Wnt6</i> transcription units showed no change in H3K27 methylation, nor was there a significant increase in methylation observed in regions known to regulate aspects of developmental <i>wg</i> expression in third-instar discs (<a href=\"#bib63\">Neumann and Cohen, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Pereira et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Koshikawa et al., 2015</a>)(<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>).

(<b>C- D</b>) Discs bearing the AP-1 GFP reporter (<b>C</b>) or stained with anti-Mmp1 (<b>D</b>), and imaged as in (<b>B</b>). AP-1 reporter expression is strongly expressed in basal cells of the pouch in day 7 ablated discs, coincident with Mmp1 expression. AP-1 reporter expression is found in the ring of wound periphery cells in day 9 ablated discs (arrowheads), while Mmp1 staining is reduced. Day 9 ablated discs bearing BRV-B-Myc have AP-1 GFP expressing cells covering the basal wound surface, resembling the expression pattern of day 7 discs, while Mmp1 expression is stronger than a wild type day 9 disc. (<b>E-F</b>) Discs stained for Wg (<b>E</b>) or bearing the BRV118-GFP reporter (<b>F</b>) following ablation with <i>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;egr</i>, and imaged as in (<b>B-D</b>). Declining expression of the reporter on day 9 is rescued in discs bearing the <i>BRV-B-Myc</i> transgene. Similarly, <i>wg</i> expression is stronger on a day 9 bearing the <i>BRV-B-Myc</i> transgene, comparable to expression level in an ablated day 7 disc. (<b>G-G\u2019</b>) A day 9 disc bearing the BRV-BC enhancer with heat shock induced flip-out clones (marked by RFP, red) expressing <i>Myc</i>, irradiated with 45\u00a0Gy and dissected 16\u2009hr later. Clones expressing <i>Myc</i> respond to damage by activating the BRV-BC enhancer (<b>G\u2019</b>, green), while the enhancer remains inactive in neighboring damaged tissue not expressing <i>Myc</i>. (<b>H-H\u2019</b>) Day 9 discs as in (<b>G-G\u2019</b>), in the absence of irradiation. Expression of <i>Myc</i> in clones (red) causes low level of BRV-BC enhancer activity (<b>H\u2019</b>, green), even in the absence of damage. (<b>I</b>) Assay of adult wing sizes that develop following ablation with <i>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;rpr</i> on day 7, 8, 9 and 10 in wild type and <i>BRV-B-Myc</i> discs, quantifying animals that eclose with fully regenerated wings. The <i>BRV-B-Myc</i> expressing animals consistently eclose with more of the full regenerated wings compared to wild type. Mean differences between wild type and <i>BRV-B-Myc</i> data sets is statistically significant, (p-value calculated by two way ANOVA). Error bars are SEM of at least 3 biological repeats, scoring a total of &gt;200 animals in each condition. (<b>J</b>) Developmental timing of wild type and <i>BRV-B-Myc</i> expressing larvae following <i>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;rpr</i> ablation on day 7, 8, 9 and 10. Delay is measured as hours at which 50% of larvae have pupariated compared to unablated wild type. The <i>BRV-B-Myc</i> transgene (red bars) does not alter developmental timing following ablation compared to wild type (gray bars) on any day ablated. Mean differences between wild type and <i>BRV-B-Myc</i> data sets is not statistically significant (N.S.), calculated by two way ANOVA.

Moreover, expression of Wg protein was increased in day 9 discs to levels comparable to those found in day 7 discs following ablation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). This likely results from an increase in <i>wg</i> transcription, since the full length BRV118 reporter, which includes the entire negatively acting BRV-C element, was also expressed in ablated day 9 discs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). This reactivation of the enhancer by <i>Myc</i> is cell autonomous, as clones expressing <i>Myc</i> in mature discs activate the enhancer following irradiation, while neighboring irradiated cells do not (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G\u2013G\u2019</a>). Interestingly, clonal expression of <i>Myc</i> causes limited activation of the enhancer even in the absence of damage, but at a significantly reduced level than with irradiation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H\u2013H\u2019</a>).

This improvement in regeneration occurred without extending the delay in pupariation induced by ablation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8J</a>). The improvement in regeneration elicited by <i>Myc</i> expression is modest by day 10, indicating that the loss of regenerative capacity becomes progressively more refractory to reversal even by increased levels of <i>Myc</i> expression. Overall, these data show that using an endogenous damage-responsive enhancer to target <i>Myc</i> expression specifically to cells surrounding the ablated tissue that give rise to the blastema can augment the regenerative process, likely by circumventing or reversing the repression of multiple genes that function in regeneration."

The loss of regenerative capacity is likely an important mechanism to balance the successful progression to reproductive adulthood at the cost of forming functionally complete tissue. Very few \u2018true\u2019 regeneration-specific genes have been identified (i.e. genes that are not required at any other time throughout the organism\u2019s life), but rather developmentally required pathways are often re-used during regeneration (<a href=\"#bib94\">Sun and Irvine, 2014</a>). Thus, how regenerative growth can be selectively inhibited without compromising cell proliferation or differentiation remains unknown. Here we have shown that in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc this loss of regenerative capacity is achieved in part by the localized epigenetic inactivation of a damage-responsive enhancer that regulates the expression of <i>wg</i> and potentially <i>Wnt6</i>. This mechanism allows an organism to continue with its normal developmental program while shutting down its regenerative response to tissue damage."

Our data confirm that JNK is strongly activated following damage, but furthermore, it appears similarly activated in both day 7 and day 9 discs, as assessed by the expression of an AP-1 reporter. Thus, the loss of regeneration that occurs between day 7 and day 9 cannot be attributed to a failure to activate JNK. Despite the similar levels of AP-1 activity, the cellular responses and changes in gene expression elicited by tissue damage differ considerably as the disc matures. Importantly, genes that are known to be downstream targets of the JNK/AP-1 pathway such as <i>Mmp1</i> (<a href=\"#bib97\">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</a>) and <i>DILP8</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Colombani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Katsuyama et al., 2015</a>) have reduced expression on day 9 when compared to day 7.

Our data shows this is due to the highly localized epigenetic silencing of a damage-responsive WNT enhancer, BRV118, that prevents their expression specifically in response to injury in mature discs, but still allows expression from nearby developmentally regulated enhancers. This mechanism ensures that the contribution of both genes to a regeneration program can be shut off in mature tissues independently of their essential roles in growth and development of the disc. Our inability to detect expression of the BRV118-GFP reporter in unablated discs suggests that the BRV118 enhancer does not have a role in normal development. However, the <i>wg<sup>1</sup></i> allele, which results in an incompletely-penetrant phenotype characterized by a failure to specify the wing pouch, is a deletion whose breakpoints are very close to the boundaries of the BRV118 fragment that we have studied (<a href=\"#bib81\">Schubiger et al., 2010</a>). This suggests that a separate\u00a0element, possibly very close to, but not fully contained within the boundaries of BRV118, may also\u00a0be disrupted by the <i>wg<sup>1</sup></i> deletion."

Thus, equivalent regeneration specific enhancers, like BRV118, might also exist for these genes, such as <i>DILP8</i> and <i>Mmp1</i>. Both genes are known to be activated by JNK, although damage-responsive enhancers have not yet been characterized. Notably though, the <i>Mmp1</i>-lacZ reporter we used to investigate <i>Mmp1</i> activation (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which accurately reflects Mmp1 protein expression following injury (<a href=\"#bib97\">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</a>), consists of a ~5 kb intronic region upstream of a lacZ reporter, which, based on its pattern of expression on days 7 and 9, must possess regulatory regions that allow both damage-induced activation and maturity-dependent silencing. Sequence comparison with BRV118 reveals several AP-1 binding sites that are identical to those found in BRV118, and multiple consensus sites for PcG repression.\u00a0This combination of regulatory motifs could therefore reflect a molecular signature of genes that function in regeneration, and thus could potentially be used to identify genes that comprise a regeneration program through genome-wide analyses in the future."

Indeed inappropriate cell fate switching following damage in imaginal discs (transdetermination) is associated with changes in PcG gene expression (<a href=\"#bib44\">Klebes et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lee et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">McClure et al., 2008</a>), and in one instance JNK signaling reduced the extent of PcG mediated repression (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lee et al., 2005</a>). A key property of epigenetic regulation by PcG is the ability to simultaneously silence multiple regions across the genome via the activity of a single master regulator complex, and, moreover, this silencing is heritable and thus its activation can maintain the locus in a repressed state through subsequent cell generations (<a href=\"#bib26\">D\u00e9jardin and Cavalli, 2005</a>). Such a mechanism is ideally suited to the sustained and progressive silencing of a regeneration program during the ongoing growth and development of imaginal discs. However, unlike Hox genes, silencing of <i>wg</i> and <i>Wnt6</i> does not involve the entire transcription unit, but rather, is restricted to a damage-responsive enhancer. A similar local mode of epigenetic regulation has been described for the <i>Drosophila rpr</i> locus, in which epigenetic blocking of an irradiation-responsive enhancer region through enrichment of H3K27me3 prevents <i>rpr</i> expression following irradiation in late embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib103\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Importantly, the remainder of the <i>rpr</i> locus itself remains accessible, and is thus responsive to developmental signals required for programmed cell death to occur in the nervous system in late embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib58\">Maurange et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Rogulja-Ortmann et al., 2008</a>). Localized epigenetic silencing of individual regulatory elements is therefore likely an important and potentially pervasive mechanism by which gene expression can be selectively activated or repressed by distinct inputs."

Thus, while the BRV-C fragment nucleates PcG-mediated repression that then spreads over the remainder of the BRV118 enhancer, mechanisms must exist that limit spread beyond the borders of the enhancer and thus preserve the activity of the adjacent developmentally-regulated enhancers. Chromatin boundary elements that are able to block the spread of heterochromatin formation have previously been described (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gaszner and Felsenfeld, 2006</a>) and are found in a variety of organisms including <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib80\">Roseman et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kahn et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lin et al., 2011</a>).

Indeed, we found that restoring <i>wg</i> expression in day 9 discs did not promote regeneration. In contrast, expression of <i>Myc</i>, which is able to increase the levels of expression of both <i>wg</i> and <i>Mmp1</i>, and possibly the expression of other genes that are similarly regulated, was able to enhance regeneration. However, it is likely that Myc does not promote the expression of all genes that have been silenced in late L3. Indeed, unlike <i>wg</i> and <i>Mmp1</i>, we found that the JAK/STAT reporter is not reactivated in mature discs by the presence of Myc (data not shown). In addition, the delay in pupariation is not restored, which possibly results from a failure to restore the\u00a0damage-responsive DILP8 expression level\u00a0to that of a younger disc. While we have shown that Myc functions cell autonomously to reactivate BRV118-mediated expression of WNT genes, it is unclear whether Myc reverses the PcG-mediated repression of BRV118 or bypasses it completely. However, since the <i>BRV-B-Myc</i> transgene is only expressed in a small region of the disc, it is not easy to detect a change in the overall level of H3K27 methylation at the WNT locus in these cells with confidence. Additionally, even increasing Myc levels has little effect by day 10, suggesting that the silencing mechanism has become even more effective. It might be necessary to combine <i>Myc</i> overexpression with other manipulations to restore regeneration at even later stages. Previous studies have implicated Myc as a regulator of chromatin organization (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amente et al., 2011</a>) and also as a regulator of cellular reprogramming (<a href=\"#bib88\">Smith and Dalton, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chappell and Dalton, 2013</a>), and therefore studying the role of Myc in reactivating BRV118-mediated expression might provide a tractable way of understanding the role of Myc in these processes."

Reporter derivatives were generated by replacing the BRV118 enhancer DNA with the genomic regions listed in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>. All GFP reporters were inserted into the <i>AttP40</i> landing site via PhiC31 recombination. The BRV-B\u0394AP1 and BRV-BC\u0394Brk transgenes were generated using InFusion PCR mutagenesis (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to sequentially delete the consensus sequences (primers listed in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). The BRV-B-Myc transgene was generated by replacing the <i>eGFP</i> coding sequence in the BRV-B GFP reporter construct with the <i>Myc</i> coding sequence (GenBank: AY058627) and inserted into the <i>AttP40</i> landing site.

Pellets were pooled and resuspended in 500\u00a0ul lysis buffer, sonicated with a Biorupter (Diagenode, Denville, NJ) on high for 12.5 min, 30 s on 30 s off in ice to yield chromatin in the 500\u20131000\u00a0bp range. The sonicated samples were placed into RIPA buffer (lysis buffer plus 10% DOC and 140\u00a0mM NaCl), centrifuged on max for 5 min at 4o\u00b0C, and transferred to a new tube. 60\u00a0\u03bcl was removed for ethanol precipitation and run on a 1.5% gel to test sonication efficiency.

The work here significantly advances previous studies of disc regeneration carried out by the Hariharan lab and others and demonstrates that silencing of a specific enhancer plays a major role in limiting a regeneration response to tissue damage. Since many organisms lose the ability to regenerate with increasing age this work suggests a mechanism that may be broadly used."

Here they find that Wg expression during regeneration requires activation of the BRV-118 enhancer, first identified by the late Gerold Schubiger. This enhancer is located at the Wg/Wnt locus and regulates both Wg and <i>Wnt6</i>, and its activation occurs after early damage but not late damage. Structure function studies indicate that the enhancer has separate activating and repressive components and consists of an activating region with AP1 sites (among others) and a repressive element that contains PcG binding sites; these factors are demonstrated to be genetically required for the activation and repression, respectively. They observe increased H3K27me, a marker of PcG silencing, on the enhancer after damage at day 9, but not day 7; but none on other regions of <i>Wnt6</i> or Wg genes nor on developmental Wg enhancers in L3 during normal development, suggesting selective silencing of this damage-responsive enhancer."

The resulting flies are viable, and develop relatively normally (except for a held-out wing phenotype like wgP, which also correlates with removal of the enhancer region). H3K27me is absent from BRV-118 region in these flies, consistent with a requirement for the repressive sequences in deposition of H3K27me. When damaged at day 9, however, regeneration was not enhanced over controls with an intact BRV-118 even though Wg expression was induced in the discs similar to an early damage response. However when Myc was driven by BRV-B, Wg, MMP1 and BRV-118:GFP enhancer induction was increased after damage at day 9 and regeneration was improved ~20% over controls. Since the delay was not increased it appears that Myc expression increases the rate of recover, although not sufficient to account for all aspects of regeneration."

One possibility is that the <i>wg<sup><a href=\"#bib37\">1</a></sup></i> chromosome has a second mutation that is responsible for this phenotype. We have excluded this possibility \u2013 we have generated the same deletion using CRISPR-Cas9 on a \u201cclean chromosome\u201d and found that those flies also have the same incompletely-penetrant wing-specification phenotype. We suspect that there might be a developmentally-regulated enhancer that functions early in larval development that is close to the boundary of the <i>wg<sup><a href=\"#bib37\">1</a></sup></i> deletion and which may be disrupted by this deletion. However, this enhancer is likely to be distinct from the damage-responsive enhancer since the BRV-118 reporter which contains a robust damage-responsive enhancer is not expressed in the absence of damage.

In subsequent unpublished experiments using older discs, we obtained results that hinted that <i>Myc</i> might also promote some regeneration in older discs. However in all these experiments, we expressed the growth-promoting gene under UAS control. It was therefore expressed in the ablated cells and in some cells that expressed the proapoptotic gene yet survived the ablation. In this study, we used the BRV-B fragment to target expression to the blastema. Since the earlier experiments suggested that other growth-promoting genes were ineffective at promoting regeneration even in younger discs, we chose to focus our efforts on whether <i>Myc</i> could promote regeneration in older discs. Hence when we found a way to target expression to the regeneration blastema using the BRV-B fragment, we only generated BRV-B-driven Myc transgenics and did not pursue the other pathways."

This is difficult to do using the genetic ablation system. However, the BRV-BC enhancer is also robustly activated by X-irradiation in younger (day 7) discs but is silenced in day 9 discs. By generating FLP-out clones that express UAS-myc, we now show clearly that the re-activation of the enhancer is cell-autonomous. Interestingly, we find that <i>Myc</i> activates the silenced enhancer, albeit at a much lower level, in day 9 discs even in the absence of radiation.
