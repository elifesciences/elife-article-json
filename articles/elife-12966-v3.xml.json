Single-neuron genomics enables direct measurement of somatic mutation rates in human brain and promises to answer this question. A recent study (<a href=\"#bib65\">Upton et al., 2015</a>) reported high rates of somatic LINE-1 element (L1) retrotransposition in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex that would have major implications for normal brain function, and suggested that these events preferentially impact genes important for neuronal function. We identify aspects of the single-cell sequencing approach, bioinformatic analysis, and validation methods that led to thousands of artifacts being interpreted as somatic mutation events. Our reanalysis supports a mutation frequency of approximately 0.2 events per cell, which is about fifty-fold lower than reported, confirming that L1 elements mobilize in some human neurons but indicating that L1 mosaicism is not ubiquitous. Through consideration of the challenges identified, we provide a foundation and framework for designing single-cell genomics studies."

Single-neuron genomics enables direct measurement of somatic mutation rates in human brain and promises to answer this question. A recent study (<a href=\"#bib65\">Upton et al., 2015</a>) reported high rates of somatic LINE-1 element (L1) retrotransposition in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex that would have major implications for normal brain function, and suggested that these events preferentially impact genes important for neuronal function. We identify aspects of the single-cell sequencing approach, bioinformatic analysis, and validation methods that led to thousands of artifacts being interpreted as somatic mutation events. Our reanalysis supports a mutation frequency of approximately 0.2 events per cell, which is about fifty-fold lower than reported, confirming that L1 elements mobilize in some human neurons but indicating that L1 mosaicism is not ubiquitous. Through consideration of the challenges identified, we provide a foundation and framework for designing single-cell genomics studies."

The extent and types of such genetic mutations have only recently become accessible using techniques that can examine the genomes of single-cells. Some of these genetic differences may result from the activity of short sections of DNA called retrotransposons, which can copy themselves and move to a different place in the genome.

The immune system, with its systematic genomic rearrangements such as V(D)J recombination, and the ordered generation of random somatic mutation coupled with a selection process, have suggested appealing analogies for generating the cellular diversity of the nervous system, and have led to searches for analogous genomic diversity in the brain (<a href=\"#bib46\">Muotri and Gage, 2006</a>). LINE-1 (L1) elements are endogenous retrotransposons that transcribe an RNA copy that is reverse-transcribed into a DNA copy that can then insert into a novel site in the genome, creating mutations capable of disrupting or modifying the expression of genes in which they insert or neighboring genes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goodier and Kazazian, 2008</a>). Evolutionarily, transposon mobilization is an essential cause of the generation of species diversity (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cordaux and Batzer, 2009</a>), so interest in possible L1 activity during brain development was spurred by the discovery that these elements can mobilize in neuronal progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coufal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Muotri et al., 2005</a>)."

Single-cell sequencing is a powerful technology that has revealed and quantified previously unknown mechanisms of somatic mutation in the human brain, providing a first proof of principle for the systematic measurement of somatic mutation rates in any normal human tissue (<a href=\"#bib15\">Evrony et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">McConnell et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lodato et al., 2015</a>). Single-cell sequencing can therefore determine the extent to which somatic mutations diversify the genomes of cells in the brain, which is foundational to understanding their potential functional impact in normal brains and possible roles in neuropsychiatric diseases of unknown etiology (<a href=\"#bib52\">Poduri et al., 2013</a>). L1 mobilization has been observed at low rates using indirect genetic techniques such as a transgenic L1 reporter in rodent brain in vivo (<a href=\"#bib45\">Muotri et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">2010</a>) and human progenitor cells in vitro (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coufal et al., 2009</a>), while studies profiling human brain bulk DNA suggested much higher rates (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baillie et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bundo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Coufal et al., 2009</a>).

Such a high rate of retrotransposition could present it as a possibly essential event in neurogenesis and would have major implications for brain function. Here we describe experimental artifacts that elevated the study's apparent rate of somatic retrotransposition by &gt;50-fold. Reanalysis of their data while filtering these artifacts generates a consensus that retrotransposition does occur in developing brain but at a much lower rate consistent with prior single-cell studies (<a href=\"#bib15\">Evrony et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al., 2015</a>), thereby constraining the range of possible functional roles for retrotransposition in the brain.

Chimera artifacts also arise during ligation and PCR steps of sequencing library preparation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kircher et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Quail et al., 2008</a>), processes integral to the RC-seq method. Chimeric sequences can create a DNA fragment connecting a LINE element to an unrelated portion of the genome, creating the appearance of biological LINE mobilization (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). Sequence analysis of Upton et al.'s putative PCR-validated candidates (Table S2 of Upton et al.) demonstrates that more than half of them (7 of 13) are chimera artifacts that could not have been generated by the process of L1 mobilization (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Some chimeras originated immediately downstream of germline L1Hs/L1Pa elements that are incapable of retrotransposition, because the L1 elements are truncated, are from an old, inactive L1 subfamily, or contain numerous inactivating mutations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). In other cases, L1 5' and 3' junction chimeras originating from distinct L1 elements were misinterpreted as two ends of the same L1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Some candidates lack poly-A tails (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), a key feature of retrotransposon insertions. Although the remaining 6/13 PCR-validated insertions lack clear evidence of being chimeras, the possibility cannot be excluded based on the limited PCR validation performed, and they are likely also chimeras because each is supported by only 1 or 2 sequencing reads (see below). The presence of chimeric artifacts among a set of insertions passing limited PCR validation supports the importance of additional careful analysis of candidate L1 sequences to help define more accurate rates of retrotransposition."

A bona fide L1 insertion creates two genome breakpoints at the insertion site, one on each end of the insertion (5' and 3'), while a chimera has only one breakpoint at the called insertion site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Full-length cloning validation, in which the entire L1 insertion is amplified in a single DNA molecule spanning both breakpoints (using primers based in the genomic sequence flanking the L1), is therefore the only way to confirm that both breakpoints are present in the same DNA molecule as a bona fide insertion, as opposed to two different chimeric molecules (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, Upton et al. did not perform full-length cloning validation on any insertion. Two independent chimeras can even occur by chance in two different DNA molecules/copies whose non-L1 sequences overlap the same genomic locus, giving the false appearance of a target site duplication (TSD) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

For example, 5' junction chimeras originating from inside an L1 element or 3' junction chimeras originating from within the poly-A tail cannot be distinguished from true insertion breakpoints by sequence analysis alone and require further experiments (i.e., full-length cloning) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Multiple reads supporting a mutation serves the same role as replication does in any scientific experiment, increasing the confidence that the finding is not an artifact. This is especially important in single-cell sequencing where chimeric DNA artifacts are more prevalent than in standard sequencing (<a href=\"#bib41\">Macaulay and Voet, 2014</a>). Essentially all major mutation-detection algorithms use the signal strength (read count and often other parameters) of known true mutations and false-positive events to predict the likelihood that individual candidate mutations are real and to determine a signal cutoff (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cibulskis et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">DePristo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mills et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012</a>).

Only 20 somatic insertion candidates supported by &gt;2 reads were detected across all 170 cells, and 12 of these were chimeras upon further sequence analysis (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The remaining 8 candidates yield a sensitivity-corrected somatic insertion rate estimate of 0.19 per cell, with no significant difference in rates between cell types (hippocampal neurons and glia, cortical neurons, and AGS hippocampal neurons) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.98, ANOVA) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). 95% of single cells did not have any somatic insertion candidates (excluding chimeras) supported by &gt;2 sequencing reads.

Lower MAPD and MDAD scores reflect higher quality and uniformity of single-cell amplification. References used for normalization of genome coverage are listed.

However, pooling of MALBAC single cells from Upton et al. achieves high quality and uniformity (low MAPD and MDAD scores) better than single-cell samples from other studies, indicating the low quality of individual single cells from Upton et al. is due to stochastic noise in each single cell likely from factors preceding MALBAC amplification such as poor tissue quality. The higher sequencing depth of MDA single neurons from Evrony et al. and MALBAC single cells from Zong et al. relative to MALBAC single cells from Upton et al. has minimal effect on MAPD/MDAD statistics since Poisson error of read counts in low-resolution 500 kb bins is well below the noise levels due to single-cell amplification even at low sequencing depths. This is confirmed by MAPD/MDAD statistics after subsampling high-coverage samples to lower read depths and by prior analyses in <a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al. (2015)</a>.

These genome-wide copy number plots were used to calculate MAPD and MDAD statistics shown in panel A. MAPD and MDAD dispersion statistics are shown for each sample. Orange lines denote \u00b1 1 copy. Purple points are off scale. Note the high quality of MALBAC single cells from Zong et al. at this resolution that achieve uniformity similar to the MDA 100-neuron sample. In contrast, the highest quality MALBAC hippocampus single neuron from Upton et al. (neuron 45\u201315) has uniformity similar to an average MDA single neuron and an average quality MALBAC neuron from Upton et al. (neuron 42\u20131) has significantly less uniformity. Although pooling of all Upton et al. normal hippocampus single neurons has uniformity similar to the highest quality MALBAC single cell from Zong et al., this reflects only systematic MALBAC noise since stochastic single-cell noise is mostly removed by pooling. On the other hand, individual MALBAC single cells from Zong et al. achieve high quality with both stochastic single-cell noise and MALBAC noise. This reflects the fact that the low quality of MALBAC single cells from Upton et al. is due to high stochastic noise present in each individual single cell that was likely present prior to MALBAC amplification. The bottom right corner of each plot shows the total sequencing depth of the sample. Plots after subsampling to lower sequencing depth shows that total sequencing depth has only a small effect on low-resolution coverage plots and statistics. Therefore, differences in sequencing depth between samples do not alter the conclusions regarding the quality of single cells from each study."

Plots show the average coverage across samples of each sample type (shading \u00b1 SD). Plots for each sample set are shown up to the maximum read depth that was possible to subsample equivalently across all samples in a sample set. Note the slightly improved coverage at \u226510x read depth of pooled MALBAC single neurons from Upton et al. relative to MALBAC single cells from Zong et al. However, this is a comparison between a pooled sample, which cancels stochastic noise present in individual single cells, versus single cells analyzed individually that were not pooled and still contain stochastic noise present in each cell. This suggests that the MALBAC implementation in Upton et al. was commensurate or slightly better than that in Zong et al., but individual cells in Upton et al. are still of significantly lower quality than individual cells in Zong et al.

We could find no precedent or chemical explanation for why PCR or next-generation sequencing would preferentially amplify chimeras, since\u00a0there are no sequence features distinguishing chimeras from true insertions in small DNA fragments that would cause preferential overamplification of the former in single-cell RC-seq. In fact, prior single-neuron sequencing studies and chimera rates of Illumina libraries and MALBAC show directly that chimeras are not preferentially amplified relative to true genomic sequence fragments and true insertions (Appendix 3; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

In single-cell sequencing, somatic mutations appear on average at the same signal level as germline heterozygous mutations (i.e. 50% of reads at the locus), while the fraction of false variant reads at a locus (e.g. sequencing errors, library PCR mutations, chimeras) is the same on average regardless of the number of cells sequenced. Accordingly, decreasing the number of cells pooled for sequencing increases the signal to noise ratio of somatic mutations (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> for a simplified mathematical framework for single-cell sequencing). Therefore, calling mutations supported by only a single sequencing read is counter to a key feature and objective of single-cell sequencing. Furthermore, although Upton et al. present qPCR experiments as additional evidence for their findings, it is important that the originators of that qPCR method consider single-cell analysis as definitive (<a href=\"#bib14\">Erwin et al., 2014</a>), and qPCR results are affected by target L1 specificity (Appendix 4)."

In contrast, germline heterozygous and homozygous variants are present in <i>D/</i>2 and <i>D</i> reads, respectively. Due to sequencing artifacts and sequencing errors, a mutation must be detected above a threshold number of reads, <i>T</i>, which also depends on the sequencing depth, <i>D</i>, since errors occur at rates, <i>e</i>, that are a constant fraction on average of the total number of reads (<i>T</i>=<i>z</i>\u00b7<i>e</i>\u00b7<i>D; z</i> is a constant chosen based on desired detection sensitivity and specificity). The fraction of error reads, <i>e</i>, is a constant on average that is independent of total sequencing depth, <i>D</i>, because library artifacts and sequencing errors occur at rates that are independent of total sequencing depth. The threshold, <i>T</i>, can be reduced with methods reducing sequencing error, but errors are still present in any current sequencing technology. Combining equations simplifies to k/n \u2265 2\u00b7z\u00b7e. This means that the mosaicism of a somatic mutation must be at least twice the sequencing error rate (or more, depending on the confidence factor) for detection to be possible in bulk DNA sequencing, regardless of sequencing depth. Below a certain level of mosaicism that depends on the sequencing error rate, detection is unlikely. Note: for simplicity, the height of the histograms (# of mutations) is scaled to the same height, and the equations do not include variance terms. (<b>B</b>) In single-cell sequencing, somatic mutations are present at the same signal level on average as germline heterozygous variants (i.e. D/2, since k/n = 1), enabling detection of low mosaicism mutations that would otherwise be below detection thresholds of bulk sequencing due to sequencing error. Due to whole genome amplification, single-cell sequencing also leads to greater variance in mutation and error signal level distributions (non-uniform amplification and dropout) and entails additional artifacts not present in bulk sequencing, which increases the noise level, <i>e'</i>, but still a lower level on average than true heterozygous mutations. However, the signal distribution of artifacts may still overlap that of true mutations, necessitating careful bioinformatics and modeling of error and true mutation signals along with rigorous validation. Note, for simplicity, the equations here do not include variance terms and bioinformatic modeling usually includes additional parameters other than read count illustrated here. Single-cell sequencing does not achieve increased sensitivity for somatic mutations without cost, because to detect a given mutation with <i>k/n</i> mosaicism, more than <i>n/k</i> single cells may need to be sequenced. The benefit of single-cell sequencing is not to reduce sequencing costs, but rather its ability to overcome limitations due to sequencing error rates on the minimum mosaicism detectable and maintaining information as to which somatic mutations are found within the same cell, which enables lineage tracing."

In any case, the key comparison for evaluating RC-seq somatic candidate veracity is between single-cell KNR insertions and single-cell somatic candidates, not between single-cell KNR insertions and bulk KNR insertions.

Although KNR insertions appear at lower read depth in single cell RC-seq relative to bulk RC-seq samples and show a bimodal distribution with ~1/3 of calls detected by only one read (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), this does not affect the conclusion that the vast majority of single-cell RC-seq somatic insertion candidates are false-positives: only 20 of the 4759 somatic candidates were detected with &gt; 2 reads across all 170 single cells and half of true somatic insertions are expected to be detected at this level based on KNR insertion read counts. However, it does predict that ~1/3 of true somatic insertions would be detected with 1 read. This bimodal distribution of KNR read counts in single-cell RC-seq is due to, both: a) high variability (non-uniformity) in single-cell MALBAC genome amplification at the length scale of L1 insertions (data not shown; and see <a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al.

Upton et al. single neurons have mean MAPD scores of 0.53 \u00b1 0.16 (SD), compared to MAPD 0.18 \u00b1 0.06 for MALBAC-amplified single cells from <a href=\"#bib70\">Zong et al.

Most germline KNR insertions (~75%) are present in a single copy per cell as well, since most are in the heterozygous state in individuals of the population. This supports the use of KNR insertions as a reference for the expected read count distribution (and signal distribution of other parameters) of somatic insertions. The evidence that most KNR insertions that are present in an individual are heterozygous is based on measured allele frequencies and genotypes of KNR insertions in prior population studies of L1 polymorphism: a) In the 1000 Genomes project studying mobile element polymorphism (<a href=\"#bib61\">Stewart et al., 2011</a>), genotyping of a large number of L1 KNR insertions (see Table S4 in that study) found an average heterozygosity of 0.85 in individuals harboring the insertions (i.e. number of individuals heterozygous/(number heterozygous + number homozygous) for each KNR insertion, averaged across all KNR insertions). The average allele frequency of these insertions was 0.26; b) In <a href=\"#bib28\">Iskow et al. (2010)</a>, the average allele frequencies of KNR insertions found by dideoxy sequencing was 0.22 (table S1 in that study) and &lt; 0.2 for insertions found by 454 sequencing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> in that study), corresponding to a heterozygosity rate for KNR insertions of at least 0.88 in individuals harboring each insertion (i.e., allele frequency p\u00a0=\u00a00.22; heterozygosity in individuals with the insertion = 2pq/(p<sup>2</sup>+2pq)) assuming insertions are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Prior studies have shown L1 insertion genotypes are almost always consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<a href=\"#bib3\">Badge et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Myers et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Seleme et al., 2006</a>); c) Ewing and Kazazian (2011) also analyzed the 1000 genomes data and found a KNR insertion allele frequency &lt; 0.2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> in that study), corresponding to an average heterozygosity &gt;0.89 for KNR insertions present in an individual; d) <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al. (2010)</a> estimate an allele frequency of chromosome X KNR insertions of 0.58 and an allele frequency of 0.38 for a set of KNR insertions identified by whole-genome profiling, corresponding to an average heterozygosity of 0.59 and 0.77, respectively in individuals harboring the insertions; d) 75% (105/140) of the KNR insertions detected in individual 1465 in <a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al. (2015)</a> (gold-standard KNR insertions detected in both bulk samples of the individual) are heterozygous or hemizygous (<a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al., 2015</a>); e) in dbRIP (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wang et al., 2006</a>), the average heterozygosity of polymorphic insertions among individuals with the insertion is 0.46 (with an average allele frequency of 0.59). This shows that most KNR insertions in an individual are heterozygous and present in a single copy per cell. We also plotted the RC-seq read count histograms of a pure set of single-copy KNR insertions\u2013 those found on chromosome X in male samples\u2013 and found a similar distribution of read counts as the full KNR set, with most insertions still detected by multiple reads in single cells: 65%, 12%, and 11% were detected with \u22653, \u226520 and \u226540 reads per sample (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Since 'single-cell somatic candidate' junction detection data is only available annotated per candidate rather than per cell, somatic candidates detected in multiple cells may skew the true junction detection rates and preclude comparison to 'single-cell KNR insertion' rates. Therefore, to allow comparison between 'single-cell somatic candidate' and 'single-cell KNR insertion' junction detection rates, the 'single-cell somatic candidate' junction detection rates in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> are for candidates detected in only one cell and excludes those detected in multiple cells.

Sensitivity for true insertions at any given read count threshold was estimated <i>per single cell</i> using the single-cell RC-seq KNR insertion read count data provided by Geoffrey Faulkner. Sensitivity was calculated as the fraction of high-confidence germline KNR insertions present in the individual (i.e. insertions detected with \u2265 40 reads in both bulk samples of the individual, and identified in prior non RC-seq L1 profiling studies with a prior study annotated in the 'Database?' column of Upton et al. tables), that were detected in the single cell above the read count threshold. Specificity at any given read count was estimated using the read count distribution of all single-cell somatic candidate calls ('Somatic L1' sheet of Table S2 in <a href=\"#bib65\">Upton et al. (2015)</a>) since nearly all are false-positives.

Finite mixture modeling can estimate the proportion of the read count distribution that belongs to each sub-population. Finite mixture modeling estimates the high and low read count sub-populations comprise 1/3 and 2/3 of the single-cell KNR insertion distribution, respectively. In contrast, the read count distribution of single-cell somatic candidates is unimodal, concentrated at low signal with nearly all (99.6%) candidates having \u2264 2 reads (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Intuitively, the absence of a high-signal component in the somatic candidate read count distribution indicates nearly all somatic candidates are false-positives. Therefore, the somatic candidate read count distribution can be treated essentially as a false-positive distribution for the purposes of deciding on an optimal read count threshold. More formally, any single-cell somatic candidate distribution is a mixture of two subpopulations: false-positive candidates (e.g. chimeras) and true somatic insertions. A finite mixture model can estimate the proportion of somatic candidates that derives from a true somatic insertion subpopulation, using a model of the high read-count component of the true-positive KNR insertion distribution as a guide. This analysis estimates a negligible fraction (&lt; 0.5%) of single-cell somatic candidates are true somatic insertions. Consequently, we can consider the read count distributions of KNR insertions and somatic candidates as reflecting true and false-positives, respectively. This then allows calculation of estimated sensitivity loss and specificity gain at increasing read count thresholds."

Further increasing the threshold to &gt; 2 reads reduces the sensitivity for true insertion calls to 24% (a further 23% reduction) and reduces false-positive calls by an estimated additional ~84% relative to the &gt; 1 read threshold\u2013 still a large improvement in specificity with a relatively modest reduction in sensitivity.

For each cell, the remaining number of somatic candidates in the cell was then corrected for the sensitivity for gold-standard KNR insertions achieved in that same cell, i.e. dividing the number of somatic candidates by the fraction of KNR insertions detected in the cell above the chosen threshold, using the gold-standard KNR insertion reference of the individual from whom the single-cell derived, as described above. This final number was the estimated pre-PCR validation somatic insertion rate for the cell, since Upton et al. did not attempt PCR validation for these somatic candidates.

At a read threshold of &gt;1 read, the estimated pre-PCR validation rate across all cells is 2.4 \u00b1 3.3 (SD) per cell prior to manual examination of candidates for chimeras. Adjusting for the chimera rate of 12/20 seen at the &gt; 2 read threshold (since the chimera rate at a &gt;1 read threshold could only be greater), gives a rate of 1.1 \u00b1 1.4 insertions per cell. At read thresholds of &gt; 3 and &gt; 4 reads, the estimated pre-PCR validation rates across all cells are 0.38 \u00b1 1.35 and 0.44 \u00b1 1.69 (SD), respectively, per cell prior to manual examination of candidates for chimeras. Adjusting for chimera rates of 8/13 and 7/12, respectively, seen in manual examination of the candidates (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) yields pre-PCR validation rate estimates of 0.15 \u00b1 0.52 and 0.18 \u00b1 0.70, respectively, for the &gt; 3 and &gt; 4 read thresholds. These are similar to the estimate of 0.19 \u00b1 0.97 at a &gt; 2 read threshold. In summary, the pre-PCR validation rates across all single cells at &gt;1, &gt; 2, &gt; 3, and &gt; 4 read thresholds (after excluding chimeras) are 1.1, 0.19, 0.15, and 0.18, respectively. This shows stability of the rate estimate at thresholds of &gt; 2 reads or more, a result of the fact that the vast majority of chimeras appear with 1 or 2 reads, while most true insertions appear at higher read counts. The stability of the rate estimate above thresholds of &gt; 2 reads supports the use of the &gt; 2 read threshold, which optimizes sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, the somatic rate calculated at the &gt; 1 read threshold is higher than the rates calculated at &gt; 2, &gt; 3, and &gt; 4 reads and a significant overestimate of the true rate for two reasons: a) the &gt; 1 read threshold begins to overlap the false-positive chimera distribution, so most candidates at the &gt; 1 read threshold are chimeras. This is confirmed by the read count histogram analyses of KNR insertions and somatic candidates discussed above\u2013 namely that there is no discernible population of high read count candidates in the read count distribution of somatic candidates as there is in the KNR insertion read count distribution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), so the population of somatic candidates at read counts of 1 and 2 are nearly all false-positives; b) this is a pre-PCR validation rate. The somatic insertion rate estimate obtained at a &gt; 1 read threshold is therefore an overestimate that would be confirmed as such after proper PCR validation, while the rate obtained at a &gt; 2 read threshold is a more accurate pre-PCR validation rate estimate."

Each can be assessed at different genomic scales (i.e. resolutions) or sequence elements, for example, in large 500 kb bins, at base-pair resolution, stratified by GC-content, at retrotransposon elements, etc. (<a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Breadth and uniformity of genome amplification are related and can vary significantly depending on the genomic scale or sequence element evaluated. For instance, if a hypothetical single-cell genome amplification method amplifies only one small 1\u00a0kb region every 500 kb across the genome while the remaining genome is unamplified (i.e. extreme non-uniformity), then a low-resolution analysis of breadth of amplification will show 100% genome coverage at 500 kb bins even though at base-pair resolution only 0.2% (1/500) of the genome is amplified. Such a single-cell method would be suitable for analysis of copy number variants larger than 500 kb, but would not be suitable for smaller mutations. Single-cell amplification breadth and uniformity of coverage must therefore be evaluated at genomic size scales and sequence elements relevant to the type(s) of mutation(s) being studied. We profiled the MALBAC-amplified single neurons from Upton, et al. using previously developed single-cell quality metrics (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>), and compared them to MDA-amplified single neurons and MALBAC-amplified single cells from prior studies."

They further assert the same is true generally of single-neuron sequencing, including prior studies (<a href=\"#bib15\">Evrony et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al., 2015</a>). However, analysis of Upton, et al.'s single-cell whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data shows directly that the authors' single-cell MALBAC amplification and WGS library preparation methods do not preferentially create and amplify chimeras relative to true genomic fragments. Chimera rates are reflected in the fraction of discordant read pairs (DNA fragments whose sequencing reads from each end of the fragment align distantly in the genome or in wrong orientation to each other) and clipped reads (partially aligning reads, which includes reads with chimera breakpoints occurring within a read rather than between read pairs of a DNA fragment). Discordant and clipped reads in Upton, et al. single cells comprise on average only 0.9 \u00b1 0.5% (SD) and 4.2 \u00b1 1.7% of all reads, respectively. Similar fractions of discordant and clipped reads, 2.3 \u00b1 1.4% and 1.4 \u00b1 0.3%, respectively, were seen in MALBAC single cells from a prior study (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zong et al., 2012</a>) (analysis performed in <a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al. (2015)</a>). If it were true, as Upton, et al. assert, that chimeras amplify to higher levels than true genomic fragments, then these rates would have been significantly greater. The low discordant and clipped read rates in Upton, et al. single cells confirm that chimeras are a small minority of their samples' DNA fragments, and that their MALBAC and WGS library preparation methods do not preferentially amplify chimeras more than true genomic fragments to any significant degree."

Only 0.4% of DNA fragments in MDA-amplified single cells are MDA chimeras, reflecting an MDA chimera rate of ~1.2 per 100 kb of amplified DNA (<a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al., 2015</a>). An additional 2-3% of fragments in single-neuron WGS samples are chimeras created during sequencing library preparation, reflected in 1.9 \u00b1 0.5% and 0.8 \u00b1 0.2%, discordant and clipped reads, respectively (<a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al., 2015</a>), which could be mitigated by alternative library preparation methods (<a href=\"#bib53\">Quail et al., 2008</a>). Single-neuron WGS (<a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al., 2015</a>) has no additional steps in which chimeras could form other than MDA and WGS library preparation. This study further presented MDA chimera spatial distributions that elucidate their mechanisms of formation and aid computational filtering. The above analyses and others (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lasken and Stockwell, 2007</a>) have therefore shown unequivocally that chimeras are a minority of reads in single-cell sequencing methods generally (i.e. the number of bases amplified between chimera events is on average much larger than the size of sequenced DNA fragments)."

In prior studies, the score distributions (reflecting read counts) of gold-standard KNR insertions in single cells have a unimodal distribution at high scores (i.e. at high read counts), clearly separable from the remaining calls concentrated at lower scores (reflecting chimeras) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Evrony et al., 2012</a>, Figure S4B; <a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

(2012)</a> (low specificity) as an indication that many true candidates at low scores are being missed (low sensitivity). This confuses specificity with sensitivity: low specificity among candidate mutations does not imply low sensitivity for true mutations. L1-IP's sensitivity is high, in fact significantly higher than RC-seq, as measured using the gold-standard KNR insertion reference (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) as well as single-copy (heterozygous and hemizygous) KNR and human genome reference insertions, the most stringent performance measure (<a href=\"#bib15\">Evrony et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Evrony et al., 2015</a>). L1-IP's specificity performance is due to the very small fraction of chimeras that are at higher scores outnumbering the very small number of true somatic insertions, highlighting the challenge of chimeras in single-cell retrotransposon analysis in the setting of low retrotransposition rates. Notably, the challenge of computational specificity was readily overcome with a definitive 3' PCR validation approach with near-perfect sensitivity and high specificity, followed by full-length validation with perfect specificity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Evrony et al., 2012</a>). We emphasize that as in any signal-noise problem where true events are distributed at higher signal than false events, lowering a threshold to include more true events at lower scores would only decrease specificity by including a relatively greater number of false-positive calls\u2013 i.e. the proportion of chimeras among candidates called with a lower threshold can only be greater than the proportion among candidates called with a higher threshold. Additional PCR validation illustrates this: 24 randomly selected L1-IP candidates supported by one read and 24 candidates randomly selected without any read count filter all failed PCR validation (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, sheet \"L1-IP |\u00a0low-read-count\"), illustrating the need for signal modeling based on read counts and other parameters using a gold-standard true mutation reference."

In fact, the four highest scoring candidates found by this method were bona fide somatic insertions, i.e. greatly improved specificity while retaining high sensitivity. For this reason single-cell whole-genome sequencing coupled with full-length validation is the definitive, (albeit a costly) method for the study of somatic retrotransposition. It is also able to profile multiple retrotransposon types (Alu, L1, SVA) as well as other types of somatic mutation (structural variants, single-nucleotide variants) in one experiment. Targeted methods such as L1-IP and RC-seq if used with an appropriate single-cell amplification method such as MDA, careful signal modeling based on true insertions, and rigorous PCR validation, are cost-effective alternatives for high-throughput studies focused on one type of retrotransposon across many cells."

In other words, DNA polymerase depends on the 5' end of the primer only to the extent that it aids in hybridization and stability of the 3' end. In this case, the 3'-most 20 bp of the forward primer match equally well to the L1Hs and L1Pa consensus sequences. Therefore, in order for the PCR reaction to specifically and preferentially amplify L1Hs and not L1Pa elements, the stringency of the PCR reaction would need to be calibrated to allow amplification only when at least the 3'-most <i>21bp</i> match to the template while not allowing amplification when only the 3'-most <i>20bp</i> match to the template (i.e. a single base mismatch stringency for the 3<sup>rd</sup> base from the 5' end of the 23 bp forward primer). Such a calibration was not performed by Upton et al. and achieving such a precise PCR stringency/specificity is unlikely using this primer design (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bru et al., 2008</a>). A prior study recognized the need for L1Hs specificity in this assay and sequenced amplicons from the qPCR reaction, finding that most amplicons corresponded to L1Hs rather than L1Pa (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coufal et al., 2009</a>; table S3). However, this result may be because the primers are incorporated into the amplicons during PCR such that the diagnostic base discriminating between L1Hs and L1Pa would be lost and replaced by the primer sequence."

If the PCR reaction only amplifies templates matching this diagnostic base, 214 L1 elements are predicted to be amplified per the UCSC In-Silico PCR tool, most of which (88%) are L1Hs and the remainder L1Pa2-4. However, without the specificity provided by the 3<sup>rd</sup> base of the forward primer, 5,166 L1 elements are predicted to be amplified from the human genome, i.e. ~24 times as many L1 elements, of which only 527 (10%) are L1Hs, and the remainder are 1136 (22%) L1Pa2, 2047 (40%) L1Pa3, 1203 (23%) L1Pa4, 178 (3%) L1Pa5, and other older L1 elements. Moreover, the ORF2 #1 Taqman probe matches the majority (71%) of these elements with no mismatches and nearly all (95%) with 1 mismatch. As a result, most of the L1 elements amplified and quantified by the qPCR assay may be older inactive L1Pa elements rather than retrotranspositionally active L1Hs elements."

                        "text": "Because qPCR measures relative changes in copy number, targeting of mostly inactive L1Pa elements would in turn cause a decrease in sensitivity for detection of L1Hs copy number changes. Additionally, any purported <i>relative</i> increase in copy number indicated by the assay would mean more dramatic <i>absolute</i> increases in L1 copy number, because relative copy number increases are measured relative to the <i>total</i> number of L1 elements amplified by the assay. For example, without specificity for L1Hs elements, even a modest 5% relative copy number increase in this assay would correspond to ~258 (5% * 5,166) additional L1Pa/L1Hs insertions per cell. And the 30-40% relative copy number differences shown by the assay in prior studies (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baillie et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Upton et al., 2015</a>) would reflect differences of ~1550\u20132070 L1Pa/L1Hs insertions per cell. qPCR estimates of hundreds to thousands of additional L1Pa/L1Hs insertions per cell are biologically unlikely due to the immense mutational burden implied and are inconsistent with even the highest prior estimates of somatic retrotransposition. Furthermore, bulk tissue is profiled by this assay, so the above rate would be revised even further upwards for neurons if retrotransposition were occurring at higher rates in neurons than other cell types."

However, a 30% <i>relative</i> difference in L1 copy number measured by the qPCR assay would be equivalent to an implausible <i>absolute</i> difference at least one order of magnitude larger than that measured by RC-seq; i.e. &gt;300 and perhaps up to ~1500 somatic insertions depending on the number of L1 elements amplified by qPCR."
