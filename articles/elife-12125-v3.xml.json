However, systematic and reliable quantification of membrane-protein energetics has been challenging. We developed a deep mutational scanning method to monitor the effects of hundreds of point mutations on helix insertion and self-association within the bacterial inner membrane. The assay quantifies insertion energetics for all natural amino acids at 27 positions across the membrane, revealing that the hydrophobicity of biological membranes is significantly higher than appreciated. We further quantitate the contributions to membrane-protein insertion from positively charged residues at the cytoplasm-membrane interface and reveal large and unanticipated differences among these residues. Finally, we derive comprehensive mutational landscapes in the membrane domains of Glycophorin A and the ErbB2 oncogene, and find that insertion and self-association are strongly coupled in receptor homodimers."

However, systematic and reliable quantification of membrane-protein energetics has been challenging. We developed a deep mutational scanning method to monitor the effects of hundreds of point mutations on helix insertion and self-association within the bacterial inner membrane. The assay quantifies insertion energetics for all natural amino acids at 27 positions across the membrane, revealing that the hydrophobicity of biological membranes is significantly higher than appreciated. We further quantitate the contributions to membrane-protein insertion from positively charged residues at the cytoplasm-membrane interface and reveal large and unanticipated differences among these residues. Finally, we derive comprehensive mutational landscapes in the membrane domains of Glycophorin A and the ErbB2 oncogene, and find that insertion and self-association are strongly coupled in receptor homodimers."

First, hundreds of different mutations were introduced into the gene that encodes the enzyme to generate a population of bacteria that each had a slightly different membrane anchor. The mutant bacteria were then grown in the presence of the antibiotic, meaning that those mutants with a more stable membrane anchor were more likely to survive and grow than those with less stable anchors."

Membrane-protein folding can be conceptually divided into two thermodynamic stages\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib47\">Popot and Engelman, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cymer et al., 2015</a>), each of which affects membrane-protein structure, function, and expression levels: the insertion into the membrane of transmembrane segments as \u03b1 helices, and their association to form helix bundles\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Ben-Tal et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Heinrich and Rapoport, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Moll and Thompson, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">White and Wimley, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Popot and Engelman, 1990</a>).

The insertion energetics obtained from this assay, however, were significantly lower than expected from previous theoretical and experimental studies; for instance, the apparent atomic-solvation parameter, which quantifies the free-energy contribution from the partitioning of hydrophobic surfaces to the membrane core, was only 10 cal/mol/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> according to the Lep measurements\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib44\">Ojemalm et al., 2011</a>), compared to ~30\u00a0cal/mol/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> from previous analyses\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrew Karplus, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Vajda et al., 1995</a>).

T\u03b2L is a genetic screen based on a chimera, in which a membrane-spanning segment is flanked on the amino terminus by the ToxR dimerization-dependent transcriptional activator of a chloramphenicol-resistance gene and on the carboxy terminus by \u03b2-lactamase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). In this construct, bacterial survival on ampicillin monitors membrane integration\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Broome-Smith et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jaurin et al., 1982</a>), and survival on chloramphenicol correlates with self-association of the membrane span\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib35\">Lis and Blumenthal, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Russ and Engelman, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Langosch et al., 1996</a>). Furthermore, \u03b2-lactamase and ToxR function only in the periplasm and cytoplasm, respectively; therefore, unlike previous assays of membrane-protein insertion\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Hessa et al., 2007</a>), the orientation of the inserted segment relative to the membrane is known, and only proteins inserted with their carboxy terminus located in the periplasm would be selected. Most studies using the TOXCAT screen fused maltose-binding protein (MBP) in the carboxy-terminal domain (instead of \u03b2-lactamase) and used the MBP-null <i>E. coli</i> strain MM39 and maltose as sole carbon source to monitor membrane integration\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib50\">Russ and Engelman, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Langosch et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Melnyk et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2004</a>). Unlike this conventional TOXCAT experiment, in T\u03b2L survival on ampicillin depends linearly on \u03b2\u2212lactamase expression levels\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Broome-Smith et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jaurin et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lis and Blumenthal, 2006</a>), thus providing a more sensitive reporter for membrane insertion than MBP. Furthermore, the MM39 strain is not amenable to high-throughput transformation as required by our study; with T\u03b2L, we were able to use the high-transformation efficiency E. cloni cells (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods)."

Here, instead, we subject libraries encoding every amino acid substitution in the membrane domain to selection on agar plates containing either ampicillin alone or ampicillin and chloramphenicol to monitor insertion and self-association, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>); the same bacterial population is also plated on non-selective agar and serves as a reference to control for clonal-representation biases. Following overnight growth, the bacteria in each plate are pooled, plasmids encoding the T\u03b2L construct are extracted from each pool, and the variable gene segment, which encodes the membrane span, is amplified by PCR. The three resulting DNA samples are subjected to deep sequencing, which reports the relative frequency of each mutant in the selected and reference populations (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boucher et al., 2014</a>) (see <a href=\"#equ1\">equation 1</a> in Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). If the cytoplasmic protein fraction were perfectly constant among different mutants, the measured population frequencies could be interpreted as the relative propensities of each mutant to insert into the membrane or to self-associate in the membrane. This condition is unlikely to hold for all mutants; still, the agreement reported below with multiple lines of biophysical evidence on purified proteins suggests that the population frequencies provide a reasonable measure for changes in membrane-insertion and self-association partitioning. Hence, if we treat the population frequencies as if the mutants\u2019 partitioning between cytosolic, membrane-inserted, and self-associated fractions were under thermodynamic control, following the Boltzmann equation we can derive, at each position <i>i</i> in the membrane span, apparent free energy changes for insertion or self-association due to the substitution from wild type to amino acid <i>aa,</i> <math id=\"inf1\"><mo>\u2206</mo><mo>\u2206</mo><msubsup><mi>G</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>a</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow></msubsup></math> (see <a href=\"#equ2\">equations 2\u20133</a> in Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Although confounding factors, such as nonspecific interactions between the inserted segment and other bacterial membrane proteins, may affect the readout from the experiment, insertion and self-association are likely to dominate, since every mutant in this library differs from the wild type by only one amino acid; furthermore, all mutants are subjected to identical selection conditions, including temperature and antibiotic, thereby minimizing experimental noise\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib36\">Mackenzie and Fleming, 2008</a>)."

To minimize the effects of self-association on experimental readout, we chose the C-terminal portion of human L-Selectin (CLS), which does not self-associate\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib57\">Srinivasan et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, the CLS amino acid sequence includes several polar amino acids (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>, bottom); we therefore reasoned that its membrane-expression levels would be sensitive even to point mutations. To verify that the deep-sequencing data reflected trends observed in experiments with single clones, we selected 10 single-point substitutions at the membrane-spanning segment\u2019s amino terminus and at its core, and subjected them to experimental analysis on a clone-by-clone basis. Each clone and the wild type were grown overnight in non-selective medium, normalized to the same density, and plated in serial dilutions on ampicillin-containing agar to estimate relative viability (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Nine of the 10 selected single-point substitutions (all but Val302Lys) showed qualitatively similar trends of viability in deep sequencing and single-clone analysis. The resolution of the deep-sequencing data, however, is much greater than that seen in the single-clone assays; for instance, whereas both charge mutations, Met303Glu and Ala311Arg, are highly deleterious according to deep sequencing and plate viability, the \u2206\u2206<math id=\"inf2\"><msubsup><mi>G</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow></msubsup></math>\u00a0value from deep sequencing for the former is 3.7\u00a0kcal/mol compared to 1.3\u00a0kcal/mol for the latter, emphasizing the larger dynamic range of deep sequencing compared to traditional viability screens. We next expressed these 10 mutants in non-selective conditions, isolated membrane preparations for each (<a href=\"#bib41\">Molloy, 2008</a>), and measured membrane-localization levels relative to wild type using Western blots with an antibody targeting \u03b2-lactamase (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>\u00a0see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). All clones expressed in the membrane fraction and ran at the expected size of ~55\u00a0kDa. Of the 10 tested mutations, 6 showed the expected trends, including mutations that increased (Met303Leu, Val304Phe, and Ala311Leu) or decreased expression (Val302Lys, Leu310Ala, and Ala311Arg) in agreement with the deep-sequencing and single-clone viability\u00a0data (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). For instance, Ala311Arg was much less viable and showed lower membrane localization than wild type, whereas Ala311Leu was more viable and had higher membrane localization. However, three mutants to charges at the amino terminus (Val311His, Met303Glu, and Val304Asp) increased expression levels according to Western blots but were disruptive according to dsT\u03b2L. We attribute this difference to the fact that ampicillin viability reports not only on membrane-expression levels but also on\u00a0the\u00a0appropriate membrane integration, which is not captured by Western blots."

The values we infer for the atomic-solvation parameter are therefore in fair agreement with values for protein cores and hydrocarbons in aqueous solution\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib59\">Vajda et al., 1995</a>), and 3\u20134 times larger than the value inferred from the Lep system\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib44\">Ojemalm et al., 2011</a>). We further note that while the ranking of apparent insertion free energies of aliphatic amino acids in dsT\u03b2L and Lep (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hessa et al., 2007</a>) is similar (<i>r</i><sup>2\u00a0</sup>=\u00a00.79, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), the magnitude of the insertion free-energy changes is nearly four times greater according to dsT\u03b2L.

This asymmetry has been used to successfully predict the orientation of membrane proteins\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib61\">von Heijne, 1989</a>), but experimental quantification of the energetics of this asymmetry met with difficulty; previous studies measured only a small energy difference (-0.5\u00a0kcal/mol) between inserting Arg and Lys in the cytoplasmic relative to the extracellular-facing side of the membrane and no asymmetry for His\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">Lerch-Bader et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">\u00d6jemalm et al., 2013</a>).

The three profiles, however, are not identical: whereas Lys and Arg are favored by 2\u00a0kcal/mol near the cytoplasm compared to near the periplasm, the titratable amino acid His shows a more modest asymmetry of 1\u00a0kcal/mol; moreover, of these three amino acids, only Arg stabilizes the segment near the cytosol, whereas Lys and His are nearly neutral at the cytosol-membrane interface. This difference between Arg and Lys, which has not been noted until now, may be due to charge delocalization in the Arg sidechain and Arg\u2019s ability to form more hydrogen bonds with lipid phosphate headgroups."

The results clearly reflect the asymmetric distribution of charges across the plasma membrane, with Arg as the most favored amino acid at the cytoplasmic surface, giving way to the large and hydrophobic amino acids, Leu, Ile, and Phe. Since the propensities reflect protein-lipid interactions, they could be used to engineer variants of natural membrane proteins that exhibit higher stability and expression levels by mutating membrane-facing positions to the highest-propensity identity. Furthermore, the results suggest that the insertion profiles could be used for bioinformatics prediction of the locations and orientations of membrane-spanning proteins, [manuscript in preparation\u00a0(Elazar et al.)]."

These differences are likely due to the fact that knowledge-based potentials reflect the frequencies of amino acids in membrane\u00a0proteins and are biased by functional constraints; indeed polar residues are often found in the membrane core, where they have important roles in oligomerization, substrate binding, transport, and conformational change. Furthermore, the dsT\u03b2L experiment is based on a single-pass segment, where every position is exposed to the membrane, whereas the knowledge-based profiles are derived from all structures, including multi-pass proteins, where many residues mediate interactions with other protein segments or line water-filled cavities."

To test whether these confounding results are due to variability in expression levels among the mutants, we subtracted from the observed effects of every mutant the expected effects due to expression-level changes according to the dsT\u03b2L insertion profiles (see <a href=\"#equ5\">equation 5</a> in Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods).

To shed light on these fundamental questions, we established a high-throughput genetic screen and used it to generate systematic mutation landscapes of insertion and self-association in the plasma membrane of live bacteria."

Our measurements, however, are three to four times larger than the corresponding ones using the Lep system\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib44\">Ojemalm et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hessa et al., 2007</a>).

The observation that the dsT\u03b2L insertion measurements for aliphatic side chains have the same ranking but are fourfold larger in magnitude compared to those from Lep (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) may indicate that the Lep system measures only a part of the energy contribution to insertion. While further investigation is needed, we speculate that the reason for the large differences between dsT\u03b2L and Lep is that total membrane-protein expression levels were not quantified in the Lep system\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Hessa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ojemalm et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">2013</a>)."

First, the penalties for most polar residues at the membrane mid-plane are likely to indicate lower bounds on their insertion energies, since the number of clones counted in the deep-sequencing data for these mutants is close to 0 (supplementary data). Second, statistical analyses\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib58\">Ulmschneider et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schramm et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Senes et al., 2007</a>) and experiments\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Hessa et al., 2007</a>) demonstrated that the aromatics Tyr and Trp are preferred in the water-membrane interface rather than in the core, although dsT\u03b2L shows the reverse (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). We suggest that these results reflect the fact that dsT\u03b2L is based on a monomeric construct where the aromatics are fully exposed to the membrane environment; however, these uncertainties require further research."

Our results strongly support this view and show that expression levels are a dominant factor in chloramphenicol survival. This dominance is perhaps not surprising in retrospect, given that a mutation\u2019s effects on monomer concentrations are counted twice in computing its effects on homodimer concentrations, and therefore on chloramphenicol viability (see <a href=\"#equ5\">equation (5)</a> in Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). A key contribution of unbiased and systematic assays, such as dsT\u03b2L, is that they clarify such trends unambiguously. Furthermore, the dsT\u03b2L insertion profiles derived from the monomeric CLS provide a self-consistent way to factor out the contributions from insertion energetics in future assays on membrane-protein association or function in unrelated membrane proteins, thereby eschewing the need to measure the expression levels of individual mutants."

The main strengths of deep mutational scanning are the ability to measure the effects of all point mutations without bias and that all mutants experience strictly equal experimental conditions, thereby limiting experimental noise. The structural simplicity of the model systems tested here, consisting of a single \u03b1 helix or of helix homodimers, plays a further role in the ability to accurately infer energetics. Combined with structural modeling, the assay can provide essential information both on association energetics and the molecular architecture of membrane receptors. More generally the data on protein-membrane and protein-protein energetics obtained from dsT\u03b2L will be used to improve models of membrane-protein energetics and to design, screen, and engineer high-expression mutants of specific membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fleishman and Baker, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Joh et al., 2014</a>)."

We then use the Rosetta Fold-and-Dock application\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib8\">Das et al., 2009</a>), which samples symmetric degrees of freedom for both docking and folding of the homodimer using the RosettaMembrane energy function\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib65\">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2006</a>). Example files and command lines for running fragment picker and fold-and-dock are available in supplementary files."

For each of the 20% lowest-energy Rosetta models, we tested whether at least two of the residues that likely mediate binding are within 5\u00a0\u00c5 of the partner monomer and all positions, which are unlikely to mediate binding, are outside a 4\u00a0\u00c5 shell. Structures that passed the filter above were clustered using the Rosetta clustering application with default parameters. The clusters were visually inspected and models showing significant kinks were eliminated."

Furthermore, the authors have identified an asymmetry for several amino acids and have used their data to predict the membrane topology of a set of <i>E. coli</i> proteins with experimentally determined TM topologies.

However, the authors mention throughout the entire manuscript many times that they present \"the first systematic mutation analysis of insertion and self-association in the plasma membrane of live bacteria\". This is simply wrong, and the entire idea is not that new. ToxR-based assays are in use for quite a while and it is common that authors present some analysis of the proteins expression levels. Thus, the entire statement, that membrane insertion and association energetics have never been studied in parallel simply is wrong. In fact, in MT Doung et al. (JMB (2007) 371, 422) the authors have adjusted their measured CAT activities to the expression levels. Furthermore, in Finger et al. (JMB (2006) 358, 1221) the authors have used a system very similar to TOXCAT and they have systematically followed the changes associated with changing expression levels. Thus, I do not see the new concept here. Similarly, I found the results of the modeling little convincing (subsection \u201cHigh-precision structure modeling constrained by systematic self-association measurements\u201d, last paragraph). Especially for small TM helix dimers there are many good predictions out, and I do not see that the current modeling results are superior."

However, in the present study the authors also express a fusion protein and a large part of that has to pass the translocon. While the fusion proteins analyzed in the present study certainly differ from the Lep systems, as we have a soluble domain, one could argue that the passage of the large soluble protein domain into the periplasm somehow influences the results."

As far as I understand the assay, one would still select the clones, as they grow on the selective agar, and add their sequence to the analysis. How meaningful is an analysis of residues, which are only partly integrated into the membrane are also expressed as soluble versions? Why should there be a negative selection if the selection pressure allows growth of all constructs? This problem might also influence the later presented interaction analysis. In principle the authors mention and use this argument in a different context in the Discussion (second paragraph)."

The system is based on the single-span membrane protein, ToxR, which lacks a signal sequence. The construct contains a water-soluble N-terminal DNA-binding domain, a transmembrane helix, and a C-terminal \u03b2-lactamase (bla) as a periplasmic selectable marker. Thus, the entire system is in reverse order from the more common Type I insertion process, with no efficient signal protein to direct insertion into the membrane. The protein system studied here is also different from other bacterial Type II membrane proteins in that it has a full N-terminal domain. One strong point of this paper is that it allows comparison of this unusual insertion process with previous systems. However, the authors do not discuss these differences, and there is no discussion of whether their system is cotranslationally or post-translationally inserted, whether it requires SecA and SecB, and whether it uses the SecYEG."

There is good reason to believe that this reflects the insertion efficiency (although even this is difficult to be sure of without Western analysis for confirmation). However, it is a real stretch to equate this with true free energies. For insertion efficiency to be interpreted as free energies then the system would need to be under thermodynamic or pseudo-thermodynamic equilibrium. This was achieved in the Lep system by quantifying the two populations of inserted states, and in Karen Fleming's system by quantifying the concentration of the inserted and un-inserted populations of protein. In this case, however, we have no idea the concentration of the un-inserted protein and whether the rate-determining step in this unusual case represents engagement with accessory proteins, insertion into the translocon, or release from the translocon. Furthermore, the concentration of soluble protein in the cell vs. the protein inserted into the membrane is not measured. I feel, the authors should report their primary data as propensities or frequencies and restrict their conclusions to statements like: \"if we treat these insertion frequency signatures as if they were under thermodynamic control following a Boltzmann we find that\u2026\" Plots derived based on this assumption are fine, but only after appropriate discussion of the caveats."

Also, it is not clear how they decide on the Z-position in the membrane for their inserted TM helix. Clearly it depends on the surrounding sequence, which was not provided. Comparing the present scale to bioinformatics scales, the distributions behave in the expected manner for hydrophobic residues, which is reassuring. Also, if the propensities from earlier papers are converted to energies using the somewhat questionable method of reverse Boltzmann statistics employed in the present paper (see supplement of [5]) they would appear to support the magnitude of the solvation parameter being similar to that found in Karen Fleming's analysis, supporting the analysis presented in the current paper. This is a striking finding, and one of the reasons I feel that the current paper should be accepted with revision. However, beyond this, the differences between the present scale and previous experimental or bioinformatics scales are not subtle. Tyr and Trp do not show more favorable interaction in the headgroup region than the center of the bilayer in the current analysis, even though it is seen in virtually every other experimental and bioinformatics study. Glu, Asp, Gln, Asn are essentially flat, and do not become more favorable as the depth of insertion approaches +/- 20 \u00c5 as in previous studies. If this is due to averaging and is not significant, the profiles should not be shown. The profiles for Lys and Arg are also different from expectation. \u0394\u0394G for Arg vs. Ala is around 0 at -5 \u00c5 (very close to the center of the bilayer!) and Lys is unfavorable in the cytoplasmic headgroup region. This must be telling us something about the specific system they are studying, which should be expanded on. I very much doubt that these data can be used alone for making general conclusions, although when appropriately analyzed to understand differences with other systems they will be quite informative."

To further confirm this sensitivity, for the 10 above-mentioned mutants we carried out plate-viability assays on a clone-by-clone basis, and in 9 saw the same behavior as in the deep sequencing experiments (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), including complete non-viability for some of the mutants."

Most importantly the statistics-based profiles are quite flat by comparison and show minor contributions for hydrophobicity or the positive-inside rule. We discuss these differences with respect to the fact that membrane-protein statistics reflect functional constraints rather than pure energetics. Reviewer #2 noted that our profiles for Tyr and Trp did not match the expectation that these residues are favored at the membrane-water interfaces. We agree with this point and discuss it in the last paragraph of the subsection \u201cSystematic per-position contributions to membrane-protein insertion\u201d, suggesting that these observations may reflect differences between single and multi-span membrane proteins. We also summarized caveats regarding the insertion scales in the Discussion, third paragraph, which we hope will clarify these points and spur future research."

Briefly, there were two reasons for using \u03b2-lactamase instead of MBP: 1. Viability on ampicillin is linearly related to \u03b2-lactamase expression levels whereas MBP on maltose is not (see refs. provided in the paper); and 2. The TOXCAT-MBP construct requires working with an MBP-null <i>E. coli</i> strain (MM39), which is not amenable to high-throughput genetic transformations, whereas with \u03b2-lactamase we could work with the E. cloni high-transformation efficiency strain."

Briefly, the Lep measurements quantified proteins that were either singly or doubly glycosylated, but did not quantify total membrane-protein levels. The observations that the Lep measurements are rank-ordered as in our measurements (and also in published biophysical experiments on an outer-membrane protein), but are fourfold smaller in magnitude, as well as the observation that the atomic-solvation parameter inferred from Lep is smaller by roughly fourfold compared to both dsT\u03b2L and previous biophysical work are consistent with a view that Lep was measuring only part of the insertion equilibrium. We have removed the argument that the differences are due to interactions with the translocon."

With respect to the self-association data we now compare to the Doung et al. data on GpA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>) finding high correspondence between their data and ours. We also revised this section to highlight the new findings in dsT\u03b2L, including positions, which were not tested in the Lemmon et al. and Doung et al. studies, but are sensitive to mutation, or the few mutations that promote self-association; without a comprehensive analysis it is unlikely to identify the very few beneficial mutations. We further shifted the emphasis from structure prediction to the insertion-association coupling by shortening the structure-prediction paragraph and changing the last sentence in the Abstract and the sub-title of the relevant section. We feel that the self-association section is an important and integral part of this paper because it shows that a single assay can easily provide systematic data on the two primary components of membrane-protein energetics: insertion and association. Furthermore, the fact that we used the insertion data derived from CLS to subtract the insertion contribution in two unrelated systems (GpA and ErbB2) confirms the general usefulness of the insertion scales and should simplify future studies that analyze mutational effects on association or function."
