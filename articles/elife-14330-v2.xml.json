Here we identified a novel feedback mechanism in controlling intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis in <i>Drosophila</i>. Sox21a, a group B Sox protein, is preferentially expressed in the committed progenitor named enteroblast (EB) to promote enterocyte differentiation. In <i>Sox21a</i> mutants, EBs do not divide, but cannot differentiate properly and have increased expression of mitogens, which then act as paracrine signals to promote intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation. This leads to a feedback amplification loop for rapid production of differentiation-defective EBs and tumorigenesis. Notably, in normal intestine following damage, Sox21a is temporally downregulated in EBs to allow the activation of the ISC-EB amplification loop for epithelial repair. We propose that executing a feedback amplification loop between stem cells and their progeny could be a common mechanism underlying tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis."

Here we identified a novel feedback mechanism in controlling intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis in <i>Drosophila</i>. Sox21a, a group B Sox protein, is preferentially expressed in the committed progenitor named enteroblast (EB) to promote enterocyte differentiation. In <i>Sox21a</i> mutants, EBs do not divide, but cannot differentiate properly and have increased expression of mitogens, which then act as paracrine signals to promote intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation. This leads to a feedback amplification loop for rapid production of differentiation-defective EBs and tumorigenesis. Notably, in normal intestine following damage, Sox21a is temporally downregulated in EBs to allow the activation of the ISC-EB amplification loop for epithelial repair. We propose that executing a feedback amplification loop between stem cells and their progeny could be a common mechanism underlying tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis."

In addition, signaling pathways that regulate mammalian ISC activity, such as Wnt, JAK/STAT, EGFR/Ras, Hippo, BMP and Notch, also play important roles in regulating <i>Drosophila</i> ISC activity during normal homeostasis and/or stress conditions (reviewed by) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biteau et al., 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib37\">Pasco et al., 2015</a>). The <i>Drosophila</i> ISC, which generates a relatively simple stem cell lineage, can be specifically marked by Delta (Dl), the Notch ligand. After each asymmetric division, an ISC will produce a new ISC and a committed progenitor cell named enteroblast (EB), which will further differentiate into either an enterocyte or an enteroendocrine cell, depending on the levels of Notch activation it received from ISCs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</a>). Enterocyte differentiation from EB requires high levels of Notch activation, and JAK/STAT signaling activity is required for both enterocyte and enteroendocrine cell differentiation from EB (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beebe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jiang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lin et al., 2010</a>). Aside from the signaling pathways, many transcription factors have been identified as important regulators of cell differentiation. Enterocyte differentiation from EB requires downregulation of Escargot (Esg) and activation of Pdm1 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Korzelius et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Loza-Coll et al., 2014</a>), whereas enteroendocrine cell differentiation from EB requires release of the inhibition by the transcriptional repressor Tramtrack and activation of acheate-scute complex (AS-C) genes and Prospero (Pros), the enteroendocrine cell determination factor (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bardin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Zeng and Hou, 2015</a>). It is largely unclear how these signaling pathways and transcription factors are coordinately regulated for balanced self-renewal of ISCs and differentiation of EBs to maintain intestinal homeostasis."

In mouse small intestine, Sox2 is expressed in ISCs and progenitor cells and is critical for ISC maintenance and differentiation of Paneth cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Furuyama et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sato et al., 2011</a>). Several Sox family proteins have been identified in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">McKimmie et al., 2005</a>), but their potential roles in the ISC lineage are unclear. Here we characterized the function of a <i>Drosophila</i> Sox gene, <i>Sox21a</i>, in the ISC lineage. We find that Sox21a is expressed in EBs and acts as a tumor suppressor in the midgut epithelium. One important function of Sox21a is to promote enterocyte differentiation by inducing Pdm1 expression. By studying its tumor suppressing function, we identified a novel feedback amplification loop between ISC and EB, which is normally suppressed by Sox21a. Temporal activation of this loop is essential for damage-induced intestinal regeneration, whereas sustained activation of this loop leads to tumorigenesis. Therefore, we revealed a novel mechanism that coordinates stem cell activity with progenitor cell differentiation, and connects regeneration with tumorigenesis."

                                "text": "From cell-type specific gene expression analysis of <i>Drosophila</i> midgut cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dutta et al., 2015</a> and unpublished data), we noticed a Sox family gene, <i>Sox21a</i>, whose RNA expression was detected only in ISCs and EBs. Interestingly, <i>Sox21a</i> seems to be mainly expressed in midgut, but not other organs in larva and adult <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chintapalli et al., 2007</a>). To characterize its expression pattern in vivo, we first generated polyclonal antibodies against Sox21a, and demonstrated that this antisera could specifically mark Sox21a antigen in the midgut epithelium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Immunostaining of the wild type midgut with this antisera revealed that Sox21a was largely undetectable in the midgut of newly eclosed and young flies of two to three days old (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Its expression began to appear with age and at 4\u20135 days old, weak Sox21a expression appeared specifically in Dl<sup>+</sup> ISCs and Notch-activated EBs that can be marked by a Notch activation reporter, Su(H)Gbe&gt;GFP (NRE&gt;GFP) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). At 7 days old, its expression could also be detected in early ECs, which display increased cell ploidy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>). The Dl<sup>+</sup> ISC and its immediate daughter EB (marked by NRE&gt;GFP) are usually adjacent to each other, forming an ISC-EB pair (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</a>). In each ISC-EB pair, the level of Sox21a expression was usually higher in EB than in ISC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,F</a>). In each progenitor cell nest where the early EC still retained NRE&gt;GFP expression, the early EC usually displayed a higher Sox21a expression level than the EB or the ISC in the same ISC-EB-early-EC cell nest (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,F</a>), suggesting that Sox21a is up-regulated in differentiating EBs. Consistent with this notion, A GFP reporter driven by an enhancer Gal4 line for <i>Sox21a</i> (GMR43E09-Gal4) showed specific expression of GFP in ISCs and EBs. Again, the intensity of GFP was much higher in EBs than in ISCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Previous studies suggest that EB differentiation requires mesenchymal-epithelial transition through downregulation of Esg (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antonello et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Korzelius et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, in fixed midgut where Sox21a was not expressed, EBs commonly displayed triangle-shaped morphology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We propose that these EBs are probably the dormant EBs that remain in the undifferentiated state (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). By contrast, in EBs where Sox21a began to be expressed, EBs instead displayed oval-shaped morphology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). These EBs are likely the activated EBs that are undergoing mesenchymal-epithelial transition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Taken together, these observations suggest that Sox21a is preferentially expressed in differentiating EBs in the intestinal epithelium. This unique expression pattern indicates that Sox21a might have a role during the process of EB differentiation into enterocyte."

Sox21a expression reaches its highest level in differentiating EC, and then gradually disappears as EC matures. Scale bars in <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, 10\u00a0\u03bcm; in <b>E</b>, 20\u00a0\u03bcm."

Because the coding region of <i>Sox21a</i> is almost entirely deleted in both alleles, they can be regarded as null alleles for <i>Sox21a</i>. Consistent with the midgut-restricted expression during development, <i>Sox21a</i> homozygous mutant flies are viable and fertile. Staining midgut of newly eclosed mutants showed that the general gut morphology and the cellular makeup of the monolayer midgut epithelium was largely normal, although the epithelial cells appeared to be more sparsely distributed in the epithelium compared to the wild type intestinal epithelium (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This indicates that Sox21a could have a role in regulating the proliferation of midgut progenitor cells during development. Strikingly, when the mutant flies got older, multilayered cell clusters composed of 50 or more cells (termed tumors hereafter) were frequently observed in both anterior and posterior midgut, and tumor incidence steadily increased with age (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). At day 6 after eclosion, approximately 49.1% and 57.9% of [JC1] and [JC2] homozygous female flies had at least one tumor in the midgut, respectively, and at day 11, approximately 77.3% and 94.1% of [JC1] and [JC2] flies had gut tumors, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Tumor size also grew with time, and in aged mutants, the tumor masses often filled up the entire lumen space, suggesting that tumors grow rapidly once it is initiated."

Like all other cells, the Su(H)Gbe-lacZ (NRE-lacZ)<sup>+</sup> EBs are more sparsely distributed in the epithelium of the mutant intestine than of the wild type intestine at day 2 after eclosion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). However, the NRE-lacZ<sup>+</sup> cells rapidly accumulated in the epithelium of the mutant intestine at day 7 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,G\u2019</a>). Thus, <i>Sox21a</i> mutants postnatally develop intestinal tumors. Co-staining Dl with NRE-lacZ revealed that ISCs and EBs were intermingled with each other in EB-accumulated regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,G\u2019</a>). Those observations suggest that the tumors in <i>Sox21a</i> mutant intestine are mainly composed of ISCs and EBs, and indicate that Sox21a might be required for EB differentiation. To test the differentiation capability of <i>Sox21a</i> mutant cells, we generated <i>Sox21a</i> homozygous mutant clones by mitotic recombination using the MARCM system. As expected, the mutant clones cell-autonomously gave rise to intestinal tumors which was mainly composed of NRE-lacZ<sup>+</sup> cells intermingled with Dl<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,H\u2019</a>). We also observed clusters of NRE-lacZ<sup>+</sup> cells outside of the clones (data not shown), which could be due to a non-cell autonomous effect by the mutant clones. There was also mild increase of Dl<sup>+</sup> cells that were scatteredly distributed within the mutant clones (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I,I\u2019</a>). Rarely but occasionally Pros<sup>+</sup> cells could be found in the mutant clones (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a> and data not shown), indicating that Sox21a is not absolutely required for enteroendocrine cell differentiation. Polyploid cells were also found in the clones but their size was relatively smaller than ECs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I\u2013J</a>). Interestingly, Pdm1, an enterocyte marker (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2009</a>), failed to be expressed in <i>Sox21a</i> mutant cells in a cell-autonomous manner (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I,I\u2019</a>).

Because Pdm1 expression is sufficient to induce differentiation of progenitor cell into enterocyte (<a href=\"#bib22\">Korzelius et al., 2014</a>), Sox21a may function to promote enterocyte differentiation by inducing Pdm1 expression. To test this hypothesis, we generated a <i>UAS-Sox21a</i> transgene and forcibly expressed it in progenitor cells using esgGal4, an ISC- and EB-specific Gal4 driver, and examined the consequences. Tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup> transgene was also added to the system to allow temporal control of transgene expression. Under normal conditions, virtually all Esg&gt;GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were negative for Pdm1 expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,A\u2019</a>). However, when Sox21a was forcibly expressed for 5 days, approximately 34.2 \u00b1 1.6% of Esg&gt;GFP<sup>+</sup> cells became positive for Pdm1 expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,B\u2019,E</a>). The Pdm1<sup>+</sup> cells were always one of the GFP<sup>+</sup> ISC-EB pairs, indicating that expression of <i>Sox21a</i> could not induce Pdm1 expression in ISCs, but EBs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,B\u2019</a>). To test this hypothesis, we forcibly expressed <i>Sox21a</i> specifically in EBs using the Su(H)Gbe-Gal4 (NRE-Gal4) driver. Indeed, transient induction of Sox21 expression for 5 days induced approximately 72.3 \u00b1 3.8% of NRE&gt;GFP<sup>+</sup> cells to turn on Pdm1 expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,D\u2019,E</a>), and these cells began to show polyploidy, indicating that they are in the process of enterocyte differentiation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,D\u2019</a>). Next, we generated MARCM clones in which all GFP+ cells had constitutive Sox21a overexpression. The ISC-containing clones grew normally in size and were able to produce both polyploidy enterocytes and Pros<sup>+</sup> enteroendocrine cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), suggesting that forced Sox21a expression does not inhibit ISC activity and does not block enteroendocrine cell differentiation. Taken together, these data suggest that Sox21a overexpression is not sufficient to induce differentiation of ISCs, but is able to induce precocious differentiation of EBs by inducing Pdm1 expression."

BrdU incorporation assay revealed that the tumor cells had strikingly high ability to incorporate BrdU (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>).

                                "text": "Because <i>Sox21a</i> mutant EBs are non-mitotic yet are responsible for tumor initiation, the mutant EBs must non-cell autonomously induce ISC proliferation to promote tumor formation. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we compared the transcriptome of Esg<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells with and without Sox21a depletion. Multiple secreted growth factors were found to be up-regulated by two fold or more in Sox21a-depleted cells, including Spitz (Spi), a ligand for EGFR/Ras/MAPK signaling, Upd3, a ligand for JAK/STAT signaling, and Pvf2 and Pvf1, which also induces Ras/MAPK signaling via PVR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Interestingly, these factors all function as positive regulators of ISC proliferation during normal homeostasis and/ or in response to injury or infection (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beebe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Biteau et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bond and Foley, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buchon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Choi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jiang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Xu et al., 2011</a>). In addition, increased Spi signaling promotes tumor development from Notch mutant ISCs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Patel et al., 2015</a>), and increased Upd3 signaling in EBs following the disruption of the Misshapen-Warts-Yorkie pathway also induce ISC proliferation and intestinal hyperplasia (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2014</a>). This raises an interesting hypothesis that <i>Sox21a</i> mutant EBs may induce ISC proliferation via paracrine Ras/MAPK and/or JAK/STAT signaling. In vivo validation of gene expression was subsequently conducted with available enhancer trap lines. Spi-lacZ is an enhancer trap line for Spi, and its lacZ expression was barely detectable in the wild type midgut epithelium, including ISCs and EBs, probably due to low levels of baseline expression in healthy midgut (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,B\u2019</a>). However, lacZ expression became readily detectable in EBs following Sox21a depletion by RNAi (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,C\u2019</a>). By contrast, we did not observe significant upregulation of Upd3-lacZ, a reporter for Upd3 expression (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, staining with phospho-ERK (pERK), a direct readout of MAPK signaling activity, revealed that the pERK signal was strongly enhanced in the diploid cells adjacent to the EB cells with Sox21a depletion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). Importantly, the increase of pERK activity in <i>Sox21a</i> mutant epithelium was completely suppressed when Sox21a was re-expressed in EBs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,F\u2019</a>), suggesting that Sox21a depletion in EB is both sufficient and necessary for enhanced pERK signaling in <i>Sox21a</i> mutant intestine. We found that conditional overexpression of Spi in EBs also produced a similar EB-like tumor phenotype, indicating that Spi upregulation could be one of the reasons responsible for the enhanced pERK signaling in ISCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,G\u2019</a>). Consistent with this hypothesis, EB-specific knockdown of <i>spi</i> significantly reduced, although not completely eliminated, the ISC overproliferation phenotype in <i>Sox21a</i> mutant intestine (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). As a comparison, EB-specific expression of <i>Sox21a</i> transgene produced a much stronger inhibitory effect on ISC proliferation in <i>Sox21a</i> mutant intestine, and the mitotic index was reduced to wildtype levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Taken together, these observations suggest that in <i>Sox21a</i> mutant intestine, loss of Sox21a in EBs causes derepression of multiple mitogens, including Spi, and others, such as Pvf2 and Pvf1, that all act as paracrine signals to induce Ras/MAPK signaling activity in ISCs and promote ISC proliferation. As a result, more mutant EBs are produced, which further propel ISC proliferation. This leads to the establishment of a positive amplification loop between ISCs and their progeny, which eventually leads to uncontrolled production of differentiation defective EBs from ISCs and consequently tumorigenesis."

We therefore tested whether the expression of Sox21a could be regulated upon tissue damage. Feeding flies with Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) has been established as an effective mean to induce intestinal damage and inflammation, which then triggers ISC activation for accelerated epithelial repair (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amcheslavsky et al., 2009</a>). A relatively rapid damage and repair process was set for this experiment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Interestingly, following DSS treatment, Sox21a expression was rapidly downregulated in EBs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,B\u2019,C,C\u2019,I</a>). This downregulation was accompanied by massive EB accumulation in the epithelium resulted from increased ISC proliferation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,C\u2019</a>). However, during the recovery phase following the DSS treatment, Sox21a was dramatically upregulated in the accumulated EBs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,D\u2019,I</a>), and differentiating ECs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,E</a>\u2019). Interestingly, spi-lacZ showed exactly the reciprocal expression pattern to Sox21a during the damage and regeneration process, as its expression was activated during the DSS treatment, and diminished at the recovery phase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F\u2013H\u201d</a>). We also examined the expression of the Sox21a expression reporter GMR43E09&gt;GFP during the damage and repair process. Consistent with the changes in Sox21a expression, GMR43E09&gt;GFP was transiently downregulated right after the damage and then upregulated 1.5\u20132 days after the damage (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

On the other hand, overexpression of Sox21a in EBs almost completely eliminated the proliferative response of ISCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>).

                        "text": "Sox family proteins in metazoan are divided into different groups based on their similarity in biochemical properties, and Sox21a belongs to the SoxB2 subgroup whose function is relatively less studied compared to the most related SoxB1 subgroup proteins, such as the pluripotency factor Sox2 (<a href=\"#bib30\">McKimmie et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sarkar and Hochedlinger, 2013</a>). By cellular and genetic analysis, here we have characterized the functions of Sox21a, a member of the SoxB2 group in <i>Drosophila</i> and revealed two major roles. First, Sox21a is essential for EC differentiation from EB. Sox21a protein is mainly expressed in differentiating EBs, a pattern that is consistent with its role in EB differentiation. Loss of Sox21a causes accumulation of undifferentiated cells that fail to express Pdm1, the EC marker. The majority of these mutant cells remain as diploid EBs and some begin to show polyploidy, indicating that mechanisms controlling EC differentiation and cell ploidy can be uncoupled. On the other hand, forced transgene expression of Sox21a in EBs accelerates their differentiation into ECs as evidenced by precocious expression of Pdm1. However, forced expression of Sox21a in ISCs does not induce their differentiation, suggesting that Sox21a is necessary but not sufficient for inducing EC differentiation from ISCs. One possible explanation for this is that EC differentiation requires both Sox21a and Notch activity. Indeed, although Notch activity is known to be both necessary and sufficient for inducing EC differentiation from ISCs, Notch activated EBs that have already been presented along the length of midgut in young flies remain dormant for several days until there is a need for cell replacement (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antonello et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hochmuth et al., 2011</a>). These observations indicate that activation of Notch alone is not sufficient to induce EB differentiation, but only primes EB for EC differentiation. Notch-activated EBs will stay in undifferentiated state until Sox21a is activated, which then promotes differentiation of the primed EBs into ECs."

                        "text": "Another surprising role for Sox21a revealed in this study is that it provides a feedback regulation of ISC activity by suppressing mitogenic signals from differentiating EBs. This function is important for controlling the strength of the ISC-EB amplification loop for balanced self-renewal of ISCs and differentiation of EBs. Because Sox21a is also required for EB differentiation, disruption of this function will cause sustained activation of the ISC-EB amplification loop as well as blocked EB differentiation, leading to the formation of EB-like tumors. Importantly, following epithelial damage, Sox21a is quickly downregulated in EBs. This allows temporal activation of the ISC-EB loop for rapid production of progenitor cells prepared for epithelial repair. During recovery, Sox21a is then temporally upregulated in EBs. This not only stops the ISC-EB amplification loop to avoid excessive EB production, but also accelerates cell differentiation for epithelial repair. Therefore, Sox21a does not simply act as a tumor suppressor in intestine. It is dynamically regulated to control the process of epithelial regeneration in response to various environmental changes via regulating the strength of the ISC-EB amplification loop. Because Sox21a expression in intestine is dynamic during normal adult development, it is conceivable that its expression could possibly be influenced by physiological changes, such as food intake and activity of symbiotic bacteria, and fine-turning Sox21a activity could be important for maintaining regular epithelial turnover. How Sox21a expression is regulated is unclear, but signaling pathways that are implicated in regulating intestinal regeneration, such as JAK/STAT or EGFR/Ras pathways are potential candidate regulators, especially JAK/STAT, which is known to be essential for EB differentiation. During the preparation of this manuscript, two groups have reported the function of Sox21a in <i>Drosophila</i> midgut (<a href=\"#bib31\">Meng and Biteau, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhai et al., 2015</a>). Meng and Biteau did not observe the tumor suppressive function of Sox21a, possibly because they used a weak mutant allele of <i>Sox21a</i> in their study. Notably, Zhai et al., observed a similar tumor suppressive role for Sox21a as reported here. Interestingly, they suggest that Sox21a is regulated by JAK/STAT signaling, as Sox21a transgene expression is able to rescue the differentiation defects caused by disrupted JAK/STAT signaling. However, we found that Sox21a was still expressed in JAK/STAT compromised EBs (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, how Sox21a is regulated during normal homeostasis and regeneration remains to be further explored, and it is possible that Sox21a could be controlled by a combination of regulators in a cell type-specific manner, with different mechanisms in ISCs and EBs. Because Sox proteins commonly function together with other cell type-specific co-factors in regulating gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kamachi and Kondoh, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sarkar and Hochedlinger, 2013</a>), Sox21a could function with different co-factors in ISCs and EBs. These are interesting questions worthy of further investigation."

Here in this case, Sox21 mutant EBs can be regarded as the tumor-initiating cells in vivo. Depleting Sox21a specifically in EBs is sufficient to initiate EB-like tumors. Conversely, restoring Sox21a function specifically in EBs is sufficient to prevent tumor development in <i>Sox21a</i> mutant intestine. However, unlike typical tumor-initiating cells, <i>Sox21a</i> mutant EBs are post-mitotic cells. In addition, their ability to initiate tumors depends on the activity of local ISCs. Therefore, this study also reveals a novel example of tumor-initiating cells in vivo that do not divide themselves, but can \u201cpropagate\u201d themselves by utilizing local stem cells."

The Sox21a-Spi mediated- ISC-EB amplification loop revealed here may provide a simple example of potential mechanisms that could connect tissue regeneration with tumorigenesis: transient activation of the stem cell- progeny amplification loop promotes regeneration, whereas sustained or irreversible activation of the amplification loop promotes tumorigenesis. We propose that this could be a general mechanism underlying tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis in other tissues, including that in mammals and humans."

When Sox21a is disrupted, EB differentiation is blocked and EBs accumulate and produce factors including Spitz that stimulate the proliferation of nearby ISCs and lead to intestinal tumors. Interestingly, the authors propose that this sequence of events is homeostatic when the gut is stressed. Following dextran sulfate feeding, Sox21a expression drops and EBs accumulate, presumably via the same mechanism, and stimulate ISC division in a manner that can be diminished by reducing Spi."

Zhai et al. observed a similar tumor suppressive function of Sox21a, and described how tumor cells communicate with ISCs to propel tumor growth. However, they did not identify the ISC-EB feedback amplification loop that is dynamically regulated to promote intestinal regeneration. Zhai et al. suggested Upd2 as the primary paracrine signal for ISC division. However, we did not observe upregulation of Upd2 in Sox21a mutant EBs and neither did they. Therefore, the effect by Upd2 RNAi observed by Zhai et al. could be due to Sox21a-independent mechanisms (this will be further discussed later). Meng and Biteau did not observe the tumor suppressive function of Sox21a, possibly because they used a weak mutant allele of Sox21a in their study. They did analyze the Sox21a expression pattern, but not in explicit detail, which is rather vital in order to reveal its dynamic nature and its participation in homeostatic control. We analyzed Sox21a at various ages and revealed its dynamic expression during adult development. We examined its expression at different time points during the process of damage-induced regeneration, and discovered its downregulation in the damage phase and upregulation in the recovery phase. As described later, we used a new DSS-treatment protocol, and similar to Meng and Biteau\u2019s observation, we found that Sox21a was upregulated as early as 1.5 days following damage. Taken together, although there are some similar results described before, we believe that the major mechanisms reported here are still novel and significant, and may have a significant impact on our understanding of stem cells in tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis."

This time we performed DSS treatment in 7 days old females, when Sox21a has already turned on. In addition, we have modified the damage-induced regeneration protocol. Previously, in order to optimize the damage response and the survival rate of flies, we fed flies with standard food soaked with DSS for 4 consecutive days. To get a more synchronous process of damage or repair, this time we directly fed flies with DSS in sucrose soaked in kimwipe paper for one and half days and dissected the intestine right after the treatment to examine changes at the damage stage, or dissected the intestine 1-2 days later to examine changes at the recovery stage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In agreement with our previous observations, DSS treatment caused a transient decline in Sox21a expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) compared to the control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), and the decline of Sox21a expression was accompanied by massive accumulation of progenitor cells, as a result of ISB-EB amplification loop activation. During recovery, Sox21a was dramatically upregulated, which was companied by massive EC differentiation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C-D</a>), as Sox21a activation drives EC differentiation. The quantitative measure of Sox21a during the processes is included in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>. We also examined the expression of the Sox21a expression reporter GMR43E09&gt;GFP during the damage and repair process.

We believe that this partial effect is likely due to the redundancy of mitogens that participate in the process, such as Pvf2 and Pvf1, both also activate RAS/ MAPK signaling and both are upregulated in <i>Sox21a</i> mutant EBs. In our studies, we did not observe upregulation of Upd2 in <i>Sox21a</i> mutant EBs, therefore the effect by Upd2 RNAi observed by Zhai et al. could be due to Sox21a-independent mechanisms. As shown in this study, specific depletion of Spi in EBs also significantly reduced the proliferative response of ISCs following DSS treatment. On the other hand, overexpression of Sox21a in EBs eliminated the proliferative response of ISCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). These observations strongly suggest that Spi should be one of the major stimulators of ISC division downstream of Sox21a during homeostatic control of intestinal epithelium."
