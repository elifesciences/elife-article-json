Here, we describe the first fully synthetic phage display library of humanized llama single domain antibody (NaLi-H1: Nanobody Library Humanized 1). Based on a humanized synthetic single domain antibody (hs2dAb) scaffold optimized for intracellular stability, the highly diverse library provides high affinity binders without animal immunization. NaLi-H1 was screened following several selection schemes against various targets (Fluorescent proteins, actin, tubulin, p53, HP1). Conformation antibodies against active RHO GTPase were also obtained. Selected hs2dAb were used in various immunoassays and were often found to be functional intrabodies, enabling tracking or inhibition of endogenous targets. Functionalization of intrabodies allowed specific protein knockdown in living cells. Finally, direct selection against the surface of tumor cells produced hs2dAb directed against tumor-specific antigens further highlighting the potential use of this library for therapeutic applications."

Here, we describe the first fully synthetic phage display library of humanized llama single domain antibody (NaLi-H1: Nanobody Library Humanized 1). Based on a humanized synthetic single domain antibody (hs2dAb) scaffold optimized for intracellular stability, the highly diverse library provides high affinity binders without animal immunization. NaLi-H1 was screened following several selection schemes against various targets (Fluorescent proteins, actin, tubulin, p53, HP1). Conformation antibodies against active RHO GTPase were also obtained. Selected hs2dAb were used in various immunoassays and were often found to be functional intrabodies, enabling tracking or inhibition of endogenous targets. Functionalization of intrabodies allowed specific protein knockdown in living cells. Finally, direct selection against the surface of tumor cells produced hs2dAb directed against tumor-specific antigens further highlighting the potential use of this library for therapeutic applications."

Over the past 20 years, recombinant methods have been developed to quickly select and improve monoclonal antibodies from highly diverse libraries. Recombinant antibodies can be selected from immune or na\u00efve libraries. Immune libraries provide in general high affinity binders but, depending on the antigen, diversity is sometimes limited. Because natural antibody selection requires animal immunization, very conserved or toxic antigens should be avoided and, in general, only limited control of the immune response is possible. On the contrary, non-immune (na\u00efve) libraries provide a\u00a0higher diversity of binders even for antigens highly conserved in mammals, but high specificity and affinity can be reached only when selecting from very large functional libraries. Immune and na\u00efve libraries are based on the manipulation of antibody fragment that retain binding capacity and specificity of the entire immunoglobulin G (IgG)."

In the case of single domain antibodies (sdAb), a VH or a VL alone, is able to bind its target antigen. Each variable domain contains four conserved framework regions (FRW or framework) and three regions called CDR (Complementarity Determining Regions) corresponding to hypervariable sequences which determine the specificity for the antigen. VH and VL can be fused together using a synthetic linker and produced as a single protein in the form of a single chain Fv (scFv). Easier to manipulate, they can be produced in several bacteria or eukaryote cell types, fused to various tags or functional domains. Interestingly, antibodies called HCAb in <i>Camelidae</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993</a>) or IgNAR in sharks (<a href=\"#bib12\">Greenberg et al., 1995</a>) have an antigen recognition part composed of only a VH domain. Camelid natural single domain VH, referred to as VHH or nanobodies, can be expressed as recombinant fragments and represent attractive alternatives over classical antibody fragments like scFvs because they are easy to manipulate and they are not limited by potential misfolding of the two domains (<a href=\"#bib56\">W\u00f6rn and Pl\u00fcckthun, 1999</a>). It is noteworthy that VHH FRWs show a high sequence and structural homology with human VH domains of family III (<a href=\"#bib33\">Muyldermans, 2013</a>) and VHH have comparable immunogenicity as human VH (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bartunek et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Holz et al., 2013</a>). Thus, they further constitute very interesting agents for therapeutic applications, some of them are currently in phase II and Phase III clinical trials (Ablynx Nanobodies; <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=ablynx\">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=ablynx</a>)."

Some scFv or sdAb have indeed been directly expressed in eukaryotic cell as intrabodies to target with high specificity intracellular antigens. Several intrabodies have been used as fluorescent protein fusion to highlight endogenous antigen in cells in a spatio-temporal manner (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nizak et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rothbauer et al., 2006</a>). Intrabodies with intrinsic blocking activity have been reported (<a href=\"#bib15\">Haque et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shin et al., 2005</a>), and several other approaches have been developed to allow a larger fraction of intrabodies to be used as inhibitory factors: forced co-localization (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tanaka et al., 2007</a>), suicide through proteasome targeting (<a href=\"#bib19\">Joshi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Melchionna and Cattaneo, 2007</a>), rerouting or sequestration to cell compartment (<a href=\"#bib3\">B\u00f6ldicke et al., 2005</a>), degradation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Caussinus et al., 2011</a>). Depending on the target, such inhibitors may have potential in human therapy. Production of functional intrabodies depends on the stability of the antibody fragments in the reducing environment of the cytosol that does not allow disulfide bond formation between conserved cysteine. In this context, many advantages of the nanobody scaffold have been reported and, in particular, higher solubility, improved stability in a reducing environment (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wesolowski et al., 2009</a>), as well as higher expression yield and thermostability (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jobling et al., 2003</a>). For all these reasons, the nanobody scaffold represents an attractive option to generate functional intrabodies."

Such a library should provide antibodies usable in conventional immune assays and be enriched in antibodies active in the intracellular environment. First, using a fusion assay in <i>E. coli</i>, a family of highly functional VHH scaffolds was isolated, optimized for intracellular expression and high stability. One particularly stable VHH scaffold consensus sequence was chosen from these selected antibodies. Additional changes were then introduced to reduce the distance between the <i>Camelidae</i> and human VH3 sequences. We confirmed by CDR grafting that this humanized synthetic scaffold (hs2dAb) was robust and functional. Statistics of amino-acid diversity in the CDRs were computed and these information were used to construct a high diversity phage display library of 3.10<sup>9</sup> independent hs2dAb. The library was then screened against diverse targets of various structures and origin. Highly specific antibodies were selected against EGFP, mCherry, \u03b2-tubulin, \u03b2-actin, heterochromatin protein HP1\u03b1, GTP-bound RHO, p53 and HER2. Affinity measurement indicated that affinities in the nM range can be obtained using this library. As expected from our design, we further showed that hs2dAb are frequently usable as fluorescent intrabodies to track antigens in cells. We also showed that they can be functionalized to induce antigen knockdown. This thus represents the first report of a large and diverse synthetic single domain antibody library enabling fully in vitro selection of highly functional antibodies and intrabodies."

We designed a pipeline for the development of functional synthetic libraries that aims at overcoming these limitations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). As a first step to construct a single domain antibody library enriched in highly stable and functional antibody fragments, we screened for a robust sdAb scaffold (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Previously, we selected from immune or na\u00efve llama VHH libraries several hundreds of clones (<a href=\"#bib31\">Monegal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Olichon and Surrey, 2007</a>). From this population, we identified a set of robust scaffolds using an assay that discriminates highly stable clones from clones prone to aggregation, or unfolding, in the\u00a0bacterial cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib37\">Olichon and Surrey, 2007</a>). This assay is based on the fusion of HA-tagged chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) to the carboxy-terminus of VHH sequences (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In these conditions, only bacteria expressing a functional VHH fusion in the reducing cytosol (non aggregating, non degraded) can grow in the presence of high antibiotic concentration, thus filtrating a sub-library of potential intrabodies. Expression yield in <i>E.coli</i> and apparent solubility as EGFP fusion in the\u00a0mammalian cell cytoplasm were further assessed to select a set of robust antibody scaffolds. Strikingly, the consensus scaffold was matching the sequence of the most robust VHH framework, represented by a single domain antibody D10 (hereafter named sdAb<sup>D10</sup>). When compared to previously reported thermostable nanobodies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Olichon et al., 2007a</a>) or intrabodies (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rothbauer et al., 2006</a>) obtained from immune libraries, sdAb<sup>D10</sup> was found to provide higher antibiotic resistance in the chloramphenicol filter assay (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Its expression yield in <i>E.coli</i> periplasm was in the higher range of soluble llama VHH fragments, allowing efficient and quantitative purification (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Purified sdAb<sup>D10</sup> showed excellent solubility, stability after treatment at 70\u00b0C and we did not observe aggregation when expressed as an intrabody fused to the EGFP in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

(i) A novel scaffold was defined by selecting a set of robust nanobodies using a CAT fusion assay (1). A consensus was derived and mutations were introduced to humanize the scaffold (2). Usability and efficacy of the novel scaffolds (VHH and humanized) were then confirmed evaluating their display on phage, expression in CHO cells and use as intrabodies (3).In silico design was completed analyzing natural CDR diversity (4) and using this information to design synthetic CDRs. A fixed size of 7 aa was chosen for the CDR1 and CDR2. 4 sizes (9, 12, 15 and 18 amino acids) were chosen for CDR3. Finally, the pHEN2 vector was improved by implementing a triple myc tag and inserting a toxic gene (ccdb) to ensure low frequency of empty clones during library construction (6). Gene synthesis (using a tri-nucleotide approach) was ordered, synthetic sequences cloned into the novel pHEN2+ vector, transformed into bacteria and plated on 430 15 cm plates. 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>9</sup> clones were obtained. Quality control was carried out using Sanger sequencing of 315 randomly picked clones and large scale sequencing of 56 000 clones. No redundant clone was found. The NaLi-H1 was then screened in various conditions and diversity, efficacy, versatility and affinity evaluated."

Seven residues of the synthetic scaffold sdAb<sup>D10</sup> were altered towards the most represented in human VH3 while five other divergent residues were kept unchanged. The four llama VHH-specific amino acids hallmarks in the framework-2 region (positions 42, 49, 50, and 52), which are essential to increase intrinsic solubility properties, as well as the Glutamine in position 103, were maintained. We named the resulting hybrid single domain VH hs2dAb (<i>humanized synthetic single domain antibody</i>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). After grafting the CDR of the anti-lamin into these two scaffolds, we analyzed their display on the\u00a0M13 surface (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) and their production by <i>E. coli</i> and by CHO cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Both scaffold showed similarly good efficacy. Importantly, both the sdAb<sup>D10</sup> and hs2dAb scaffolds enabled functional display of the grafted CDRs and robust detection of endogenous lamin was observed by immunofluorescence staining of Hela cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Last, Rothbauer et al. (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rothbauer et al., 2006</a>) showed that the original anti-lamin VHH recognized its target antigen upon intracellular expression. Similarly, we observed that both the hs2dAb and the sdAb<sup>D10</sup> scaffolds allowed the\u00a0efficient intrabody use of the synthetic anti-lamin antibodies (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). This further indicated that the synthetic scaffolds were robust, non-aggregating and resisted to the reducing conditions found in the cytosol, while allowing the\u00a0proper display of CDR loops. As partial humanization did not affect the properties of the sdAb<sup>D10</sup> scaffold, we chose the hs2dAb scaffold as a unique framework to construct a diverse library of synthetic nanobodies endowed with the characteristic stability of these single domain antibodies while displaying an amino acid sequence closer to human VH3."

A constant length of 7 amino acids was selected for CDR1 and CDR2. A large spectrum of <i>Camelidae</i> VHH CDR3 length is naturally observed and this loop is known to contribute strongly to antigen binding selectivity. Thus, we chose to use four different lengths of CDR3 to cover this spectrum (9, 12, 15 or and 18 amino acids) and introduce random amino acid (except cysteine) at each position."

The synthetic library was inserted into a modified pHEN2 phagemid vector containing a triple myc-tag and suicide gene (ccdB) that allowed positive selection of insert-bearing clones (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bernard et al., 1994</a>). Massive electroporation was carried out using <i>E. coli</i> TG1 cells and 430 large agar dishes (140\u00a0mm) were used to ensure proper plating of the library. About 3.10<sup>9</sup> individual recombinant hs2dAb clones were obtained. We named this library NaLi-H1 (for Nanobody Library-Humanized 1). We first evaluated the quality of the NaLi-H1 library by sequencing 315 random clones. Only 13 sequences were found to be incorrect (bearing an in-frame stop codon, missing one base, missing a large region [the CDR1 or CDR1-FWR1- CDR2], or being empty). Thus, a total of about 4% of potential default was observed, which is rather low and only marginal in comparison to the 3.10<sup>9</sup> clones obtained. The diversity was then evaluated by sequencing 5.6 10<sup>5</sup> inserts using ion Torrent chips (Life Technologies). This confirmed the quality of the library and showed that the four CDR3 lengths (9, 12, 15 or and 18 amino acids) were present in similar proportions. The diversity and statistical distribution of amino acids in the CDRs were found to be as expected (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). To estimate the overall folding of the hs2dAb present in the library, we picked randomly 24 clones and tested their solubility in bacteria medium after secretion. Medium were centrifuged at 250 000\u2009<i>g</i> and the supernatant and pellet were analyzed. All tested clones showed essentially complete solubility, at least as good as a natural Lama antibody (GFP4). Even after warming at 90\u00b0C for 10 min, the hs2dAb showed good solubility (over 70%) (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

After two rounds of selection, 3 out of 40 clones analyzed were shown to detect endogenous tubulin by immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

                                "text": "One of the main advantages of full in vitro immunization using display technologies is the control of antigen conformation and concentration. It allows to drive selection towards the desired outcome. For example, selection schemes can be devised to improve the recovery of high affinity binders endowed with low off-rate kinetics (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2007</a>), to target specific epitopes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Even-Desrumeaux et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Vielemeyer et al., 2009</a>), or to identify conformation sensitive-binders (<a href=\"#bib15\">Haque et al., 2011</a>). Recombinant antibody fragment library screening have, for example, provided several binders targeting selectively the active conformation of GTP binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dimitrov et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nizak et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tanaka et al., 2007</a>). We hypothesized that the NaLi-H1 synthetic library had enough diversity and functionality to enable the identification of selective conformational binders. A subtractive panning was performed to select conformation-specific antibodies directed against small GTPases from the RHO subfamily (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chinestra et al., 2012</a>). Small GTPases are molecular switch that cycle between an inactive and an active state when bound to GDP or GTP nucleotides, respectively. Mutant of small GTPases can be designed that adopt stably an active or inactive conformation. A constitutively active (CA) mutant RHOA L63 was expressed in HEK293 as a bait then freshly pulled down for panning to preserve its native conformation. To enrich in phage specific for GTP-bound RHOA, a depletion step was introduced from the second round of panning using GDP-bound RHO proteins. After four rounds of selection, clones were analyzed using phage ELISA against either wild type RHOA loaded with GTP\u03b3S (a non-hydrolysable analogue of GTP) or GDP-loaded RHOA. Forty clones presenting a differential ELISA signal in favor of the GTP loaded RHOA were sequenced. One antibody, represented by clone H12, represented more than 50% of the population. We analyzed H12 binding specificity by ELISA on several purified RHO proteins expressed as GST fusion in <i>E.coli.</i> H12 recognized the constitutively active mutant RHOA L63 (RHOA-CA) which is bound to GTP due to impaired hydrolysis activity. A similar signal was obtained with wild type RHOA loaded with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GTP\u03b3S. In contrast, no binding was observed to the dominant negative RHOA N19 mutant RHOA-DN nor to GDP-loaded wild type RHOA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The capacity of H12 to specifically immunoprecipitate GTP-loaded RHOA from mammalian cell extracts was then evaluated in comparison to the standard method to assay RHO activity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ren et al., 1999</a>). This pull down method is based on the RHO binding domain of Rhotekin fused to GST (GST-RBD) which is known to bind to the active conformation of RHO GTPase. The hs2dAb H12 bearing a carboxy-terminal CBD (Chitin-Binding Domain) was expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and immobilized on chitin beads. These beads were then incubated with HeLa cell extracts pre-treated with either GTP\u03b3S or GDP to load small GTPases with the respective nucleotide. The H12 hs2dAb was found to be highly selective of RHO loaded with GTP\u03b3S as it was unable to precipitate RHO from GDP loaded extract (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). A similarly strong conformation-specificity was found when using H12 for immunofluorescence staining (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). HeLa cells expressing the GFP-RHOA constitutively active mutant carrying the mutation Q63L (GFP-RHOA CA) or the dominant negative mutated T19N (GFP-RHOA DN), were fixed and stained with H12 hs2dAb. Expression of the dominant negative mutant GFP-RHOA DN, did not lead to an increased signal over the background of un-transfected cells. In contrast, a staining with H12 was correlated with the level of GFP-RHOA CA mutant expression. Note that the signal does not fully overlap GFP fluorescence and appeared stronger at the cell border and in large zone where cell shape is strongly retracted by large bundled actin stress fibers induced by a sustained activation of the RHOA/ROCK pathway (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mayer et al., 1999</a>). This CA mutant, like active mutant of many small GTPases related to RAS still need to be activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors to be loaded with GTP and display the active conformation. Thus, we believe that the H12 staining revealed the active form of this mutant in cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). All together, these results demonstrated that the H12 hs2dAb is selective for RHO GTPases in their active conformation, highlighting the performance and diversity of the NaLi-H1 library."

Antibodies also represent a unique tool to identify novel targets at the cell surface. Using synthetic libraries like the NaLi-H1 library to carry out direct selection against the cell surface of tumor cells would strongly accelerate the identification of specific antigens while allowing extended control over the conditions of selection. A subtractive selection scheme was set up to identify antibodies selectively detecting the surface of breast tumor cells: phages displaying hs2dAbs were first depleted against a reference cell line before being selected against the target one (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). As a target cell line, we used the SKBR3 line, which is known to overexpress the HER2 cell surface protein, while the MCF7 cell line, negative for HER2, was used to pre-adsorb the library. After the third round of bio-panning, 88 clones were analyzed by FACS and 58 were found to be positive when tested on SKBR3 cells and negative on MCF7 cells. Sequencing the 58 positive clones revealed that 15 independent binders had been selected. Although the subtractive selection was not performed on identical cell lines expressing or not HER2, we observed strikingly that 12 clones out of 15 recognized HER2 exoplasmic domain by ELISA using HER2-Fc as a target antigen (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), suggesting that it behaves as a dominant differential epitope. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, these antibodies efficiently detected HER2 at the cell surface by immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) or by FACS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). These experiments demonstrated that the NaLi-H1 library will represent a unique tool to discover, in a rapid and cost effective manner, specific antibodies detecting antigens present at the surface of pathological cells. These antibodies may then be used to identify the corresponding target."

                                "text": "Various antibody fragments have long been proposed to represent powerful tools when expressed in cells as intrabodies. Although several studies indeed report efficient use of intrabodies (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib20\">Kaiser et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lobato and Rabbitts, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Stocks, 2005</a>]), this is limited to antibody scaffolds that resist to the reducing environment of the cytosol. We evaluated the use of the hs2dAb scaffold to develop intrabodies. Randomly chosen hs2dAbs were fused to a fluorescent protein and observed in living cells. In comparison to our previous experience with scFv or nanobody libraries in which a majority of tested antibodies showed aggregation when expressed in the cytosol as an EGFP-fusion, most of the hs2dAbs tested here gave a monodispersed fluorescence, and very few were showing aggregates. Monodispersed fluorescence of the EGFP has been proposed to be a convenient indicator of stability and potential use as intrabody (<a href=\"#bib13\">Guglielmi et al., 2011</a>). Several hs2dAb directed against actin, tubulin, EGFP or p53 were tested for their ability to trace intracellular antigens in living cells. None of the anti-tubulin or anti-actin antibodies tested were found localized on microtubule or microfilament, respectively, in living cells. We reasoned that this poor efficiency may be linked to the antigen denaturating conditions used during the selection of antibodies directed against actin. The existence of a large pool of unpolymerized actin and tubulin may also prevent efficient recruitment on the polymers. In contrast, several anti-GFP and anti-mCherry hs2dAbs were found to efficiently label their targets, like for example GFP-Rab6 or Myr-Palm-mCherry fusion proteins, in living cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Similarly, the anti-p53 hs2dAb fused to mCherry were clearly accumulated in the nucleus of SKBR3 cells where endogenous p53 is also localized. This signal was enhanced in cells overexpressing p53-EGFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This further confirmed the binding specificity of the hs2dAb anti-p53 while expressed in the reducing cytosol. Effective intrabodies were also obtained against HP1. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> (lower panel) shows that anti-HP1 expressed as an EGFP tagged protein in HeLa cells localized in the nucleus where it labels condensed structures similar to HP1 usual staining. In contrast, a diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear staining was obtained using non relevant hs2dAbs fused to EGFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, upper panel)."

                                "text": "These results indicate that functional intrabodies can be obtained at high frequency using the NaLi-H1 library. Intrabodies can be used, upon fusion with a fluorescent protein, to track the dynamics of their target in living cells (see for example <a href=\"#bib34\">Nizak et al., 2003a</a>). Such an application is illustrated in the <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> where an hs2dAb directed against mCherry is used to track mCherry-fused Rab6 in living cells. Intrabodies may allow not only to track the dynamics of their cellular target, but also to perturb, or block, their activity. Our results indeed indicate that the H12 antibody was able to perturb endogenous RHO activity when expressed in the cytosol. We could not directly image enrichment of the H12 antibodies in cellular sub-domains in living cells but we observed that H12 may behave as an efficient intrabody carrying out co-immunoprecipitation experiments. H12 carrying a carboxy-terminal myc tag was expressed in HeLa cells together with either the CBD-fused RHOA DN or with the CBD-RHOA CA mutants. H12 was pulled-down by RHOA CA but not by inactive RHOA DN (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). H12 thus worked as an intrabody and kept its conformation sensitivity in the cytosol. Because RHO GTPases are involved in signaling pathways that promotes the actin cytoskeleton polymerization, we looked at functional effects induced by H12 overexpression. In contrast to un-transfected cells or cells transfected with various non-relevant EGFP fused hs2dAb (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, upper panel), we observed that cells expressing H12-EGFP were totally devoid of actin stress fibers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, lower panel). This alteration in actin filament organization was associated with marked changed in cell shape characteristic of loss of intracellular mechanical forces and tension. As RHOA plays a major role in activating myosin II and actin cytoskeleton reorganization, our results suggested that H12 efficiently perturbed RHO-dependent signaling, mimicking the phenotype induced by the C3 exoenzyme RHO inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ridley and Hall, 1992</a>)."

                                "text": "Identification of blocking antibodies is a challenging task and not all functional intrabodies are inhibitory. However, it is possible to functionalize non-blocking intrabodies to inhibit their target function. One approach relies on the ubiquitinylation and degradation of the recognized target as described by <a href=\"#bib4\">Caussinus et al. (2011)</a>. This approach is based on the fusion of intrabodies to an F-box domain which allows interaction with Skip1, a member of the SCF complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the complex E1/E2/E3 ubiquitinylation machinery, that targets proteins to proteasome-dependent cellular degradation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Caussinus et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This approach was efficiently developed to target several EGFP fusion proteins in <i>Drosophila</i> using a single anti EGFP intrabody, named GFP4, which is a robust and high affinity EGFP llama intrabody originally isolated from an immune library (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rothbauer et al., 2006</a>). To get insight into the relative functionality of hs2dAb for such a protein interference approach, several of the anti EGFP hs2dAb selected from the NaLi-H1 library were fused at their amino terminus to the Fbox domain and their efficacy was compared to the efficacy of the Fbox-GFP4 nanobody. To detect cells expressing Fbox-intrabody fusion proteins (F-Ib), we constructed a bicistronic vector driving the co-expression of F-Ib together with a mitochondria-targeted mCherry (Mito-mCherry) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We expressed the F-Ib antibodies in a HeLa clone stably expressing EGFP fused to histone H2B (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sillj\u00e9 et al., 2006</a>) and looked for EGFP-H2B depletion. As expected, F-GFP4, also known as degradFP, induced a strong reduction of H2B-EGFP expression as analyzed by western blot (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Accordingly, a strong reduction in nuclear fluorescence intensity was observed in cells expressing F-GFP4 (see mito-mCherry positive cells, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). No effect was observed when expressing either GFP4 alone or a GFP4 fused to a truncated, nonfunctional, Fbox domain (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). When anti-EGFP clones selected from the NaLi-H1 library were tested, we observed that some of the hs2dAb that were found to active as fluorescent intrabodies failed to degrade H2B-EGFP when expressed as F-Ib. This highlights the fact that not all intrabodies can efficiently be functionalized with the F-box and that in vivo binding to a target is not the only parameter to consider. However, several hs2dAb anti-EGFP induced a complete disappearance of nuclear H2B-EGFP signal when expressed as F-Ib (F-R3TF3, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) while no reduction was observed when using an anti-EGFP that cannot be used as an intrabody (F-R3TG4, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). FACS analysis showed a decreased of fluorescence intensity by as much as 70% (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). As expected, this effect was reversed in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Altogether, these experiments show that the hs2dAb scaffold enables the frequent selection of antibodies that can be expressed in the mammalian cell cytoplasm to be used as functional fluorescent or inhibitory intrabodies."

                        "text": "Here, we report the construction of the first large fully synthetic single domain antibody library based on a humanized scaffold derived from llama VHH. A set of robust nanobody scaffolds was first identified using a positive expression screening in <i>E. coli</i> cytosol. One very robust scaffold (sdAb<sup>D10</sup>) was identified and was used as a base. After introduction of several modifications that aimed at humanizing its primary sequence, we designed the hs2dAb scaffold which is as stable as sdAb<sup>D10</sup> while being closer to human VH3. Our data indicate that the hs2dAb displays partial resistance and/or refolding after treatment for 10\u2009min at 90\u00b0C. Using CDR grafting experiments we confirmed the efficacy and the stability of the synthetic scaffold to display CDR regions. Based on our prior experience on phage display libraries, immune or na\u00efve llama VHH libraries (<a href=\"#bib31\">Monegal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Olichon and Surrey, 2007</a>) or from scFv libraries (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dimitrov et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Goffinet et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nizak et al., 2003a</a>) we then rationally designed CDR diversity with fixed CDR1 and CDR2 size and four CDR3 sizes (9, 12, 15 or and 18 amino acids). The power of modern gene synthesis approach permits to reach very high genetic diversity while controlling codon bias and cloning features. Fully random codon combination using NNN or NNK trinucleotide cannot prevent stop codon, undesired cysteine or hydrophobic residues to be incorporated, and it does not lead to the\u00a0controlled probability of amino acid occurrence at a given position. Therefore a more rational design was implemented with defined set of codons for each CDR amino acid position so that it does not mimic natural diversity, in contrast to recently developed Fab synthetic libraries (<a href=\"#bib41\">Prassler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zhai et al., 2011</a>), but is rather optimized for intrinsic hydrophilicity or solubility. After a\u00a0large-scale cloning of synthetic fragments, 3 billion independent clones were transformed in the bacteria. Library quality was confirmed by Sanger and next generation sequencing."

Various selection schemes yielded a large diversity of high affinity and high selectivity binders. Selections were carried out using purified antigen coated on polystyrene, on magnetic beads or directly on the\u00a0cell surface. In many cases, two rounds of selection were sufficient to obtain selective binders. We usually analyzed only\u00a080 randomly picked clones because the diversity of specific binders was systemically high. Only a\u00a0few selections led to antibodies usable in western blotting (anti-actin, ant-tubulin) probably because most screenings were done using natively folded targets. Accordingly, selected hs2dAb performed very well in other conventional immunoassays like ELISA, FACS, immunoprecipitation or immunofluorescence. Affinity measurements done by surface plasmon resonance revealed KD values in the order of 10 nanomolar and up to 50 picomolar. Such high affinities are rather good and usually rarely observed for monovalent binders obtained without in vivo\u00a0immunization or in vitro affinity maturation steps (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

Analytes injections lasted for 120\u00a0s each and were separated by 10\u00a0s dissociation phases. At this time of buffer exchange, a slight refraction index discrepancy between the sample and the flow buffer can induce a drop in resonance unit. This common bulk effect, which is clearly visible on sensorgrams with a\u00a0smaller scale range on the RU axis (ie: R3SE4, R2TB5), does not affect the measurement of off-rate constant. Off-rate constant was calculated from an extended dissociation period of 10 min following the last injection according to the single cycle kinetics method. Each sensorgram (expressed in RUs as a function of time in seconds) represents a differential response where the response on an empty reference channel (Fc1) was subtracted. The red curves correspond to the data and the black curves represent the fit done by the BIAevaluation software.

Because it is a fully synthetic, non immune, library, it does not depend on animal experimentation, it is not limited by natural immunogenicity or toxicity of antigens and allows to develop and adjust the\u00a0selection without ethic consideration. In addition, because all steps are carried out in vitro, conditions can be tightly controlled. This allowed to develop powerful differential selection and to identify conformation-specific antibodies. This also allowed to directly screen for antibodies directed against antigens specifically present at the surface of a particular cell type. Such a differential selection will be a powerful approach to identify novel antigen at the surface of tumor or infected cells. Such antibodies may also represent powerful tools for diagnostic and therapeutic applications to target cells in human pathologies. For example, after dimerization using Fc domains, hs2dAb antibodies may be used to target tumor cells and benefit from antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) for example. They may also be used directly as the smallest antibody-derived domain naked as an agonist or antagonist or armed for enhanced toxicity. Similarly, it may be labeled using radioactive compounds (e.g. <sup>99</sup>mTc, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>64</sup>Cu) and used to image tumors in patient using positron emission tomography. Altogether, he NaLi-H1 library may accelerate the identification of novel potent tools to be used in human clinical applications."

The goal was not only to define a robust scaffold that would be efficiently produced without aggregation but also to allow frequent selection of functional intrabodies. Intrabodies have been isolated from various antibody libraries (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nizak et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rothbauer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tanaka and Rabbitts, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vercruysse et al., 2010</a>) as well as other protein scaffold like Darpin (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tamaskovic et al., 2012</a>) or FN3 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Koide et al., 2012</a>) which are devoid of cysteine. A peculiar feature of the NaLi-H1 library is that it is based on a humanized nanobody-like robust scaffold, stable in a reducing environment, while it still contains the two canonical cysteine residues. Stabilized nanobodies, human single domain scaffolds (<a href=\"#bib6\">Christ et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Saerens et al., 2005</a>) and libraries (<a href=\"#bib11\">Goldman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mandrup et al., 2013</a>) were reported before. However, to our knowledge, no synthetic library producing at high frequency functional intrabodies was developed before based on such stabilized scaffolds. Almost every hs2dAb antibodies we expressed in mammalian cytosol showed no sign of aggregation, which further supported the idea that the synthetic scaffold we designed is robust and highly resistant to reduction. Previous studies showed that functional intrabody identification often relied on additional steps of selection in a protein\u2013protein interaction reporter system such as PCA (<a href=\"#bib22\">Koch et al., 2006</a>) or bacterial 2 hybrid (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pellis et al., 2012</a>), yeast IACT (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tanaka and Rabbitts, 2010</a>) or F2H assays (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zolghadr et al., 2008</a>). Using the NaLi-H1 library, we observed that without using particular selection schemes, functional intrabodies were frequently obtained. Although we did not formally compare the NaLi-H1 library to previous llama na\u00efve or semi synthetic libraries, the functionality of selected hs2dAb was compared to a sub-nanomolar affinity intrabody, the GFP4 nanobody, which has been extensively used (<a href=\"#bib4\">Caussinus et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kirchhofer et al., 2010</a>). We observed by monitoring its signal-to-noise ratio and by using it in a protein knockdown assay that NaLi-H1 can provide highly functional hs2dAb which appeared as good as intrabodies from immune libraries."

Intrabodies may be used to directly block their target proteins in cells. One of the conformation-sensitive antibody that was selected can be used to inhibit active RHO GTPase signaling in living cells and is as potent as the C3 exoenzyme toxin. Only few intrabodies have been described to be intrinsically inhibitors of protein activity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Haque et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vercruysse et al., 2010</a>), and our results suggest that the NaLi-H1 library may enable rapid selection of inhibitory antibodies. The next challenge will be to select conformational sensors specifically directed against a particular member of closely related RHO subtypes (RHOA/B/C) which share more than 90% similarity in primary sequence. But in any case, our results show that the NaLi-H1 library allows the selection of efficient, conformation-specific, inhibitory intrabodies."

Each His-tagged hs2dAb in running buffer was injected in flow cells at a flow-rate of 10\u2009\u03bcL/min. The total amount of immobilized hs2dAb-6xHis was 250\u2013300 resonance units. (RUs; 1 RU corresponds approximately to 1 pg/mm2 of protein on the sensor\u00a0chip). A Single-Cycle Kinetics (SCK) analysis to determine association (on-rates), dissociation (off-rates) and affinity constants (kon, koff and KD respectively) was carried out. SCK method prevents potential inaccuracy due to sensorchip regeneration between cycles which are necessary in the conventional multiple cycle kinetics (MCK) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Trutnau, 2006</a>). SCK binding parameters are evaluated for each injection according to the tools and fit models of the BIAevaluation software, giving similar values than MCK. As hs2dAb were smaller proteins than their respective antigens, hs2dAbs were captured on the sensorchip while the recombinant antigens were used as analytes. Analytes were injected sequentially with increased concentrations ranging between 3.125 nM to 50 nM in a single cycle without regeneration of the sensorship between injections. Binding parameters were obtained by fitting the overlaid sensorgrams with the 1:1. Langmuir binding model of the BIAevaluation software version 1.0."

Three general advices can be given here: (1) In roughly 70% of the screen, specific clones were obtained. In many case, when not specific binders were recovered, we identified the antigen that was used as the principal cause of failure. It is often a good idea to insist and use an alternative target preparation and ensure its proper display during the selection phases. (2) A key step to obtain specific clones is the washing step. They should be extensive, numerous and in large volume, changing tubes several times. While it is always a good idea to start washing as quickly as possible, if the affinity of the hs2dAb obtained is too low then extended washing steps may be used in a subsequent screening to select for a low k<sub>off</sub>. (3) We usually test for binders after the second and third rounds of selection, and more rarely after a fourth round. The method used to identify binders at the end of the selection should to be as close as possible to plan usage of the recombinant antibody. If immunofluorescence is planned, it ideally should be used to identify specific binders. If western blotting is the major application, It should be the preferred method to be used."

Previously, immunization of Camelids was necessary to isolate functional nanobodies. With the NaLi-H1 library this immunization step is removed and the screening is entirely performed in vitro, where at each step the conditions can be controlled and manipulated. This has several advantages as no animal experimentation is needed, and binders to highly conserved or toxic antigens can be isolated. The provided data suggest that the library will be a useful and versatile tool for selection of various nanobodies. Some of the described antibodies, such as the conformation-specific nanobody against active Rho, will be directly useful for the cell-biological community."

Although the binding to Protein A and Protein L has indeed been described for some VH3 (Potter, Li and Capra.J Immunol 1996; 157:2982-2988; Rodrigo, Gruveg\u00e5rd and Van Alstine. Antibodies 2015, 4, 259-277), the hs2dAb scaffold cannot bind Protein A nor Protein L. We believe that the synthetic scaffold does not preserve the binding interface of some natural VH3 and mainly does not contain the residues in CDR2 that determine this interaction. Alternatively, to assess the relative folding of hs2dAb, we picked randomly 26 clones and carried out sequential ultracentrifugation. We also analyzed the behavior of a few selected clones directed against GFP, mCherry or lamin, as well as the natural anti-GFP nanobody GFP (also known as Chromobody). All the antibodies we tested were found (~100% ) in the supernatant after a 250 000 g spin. After warming at 90\u00b0C for 20 minutes, over 70% stays in the supernatant confirming strong resistance to denaturation.

The specificity of the anti-Lamin antibody is quite clear as it is simply a CDR grafting from a published antibody and we obtained the same staining.

We added an shRNA + UV treatment experiment for the anti-p53 (new <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Using siRNA was more complicated for HP1 because of inter- dependence that exist between the different isoform of HP1. As it would be beyond the scope of this article to study HP1 we decided not to provide siRNA data. Instead we carried out immunofluorescence upon overexpression of the different isoforms as well as western blotting (new <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These experiments suggest that the selected HP1 antibody is directed against \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 HP1.
