Substrate addition to yeast expressing transporter fusions with yellow fluorescent protein and mCerulean triggered substrate-dependent donor quenching or resonance energy transfer. Fluorescence changes were nitrate/peptide-specific, respectively. Like CHL1, NiTrac1 had biphasic kinetics. Mutation of T101A eliminated high-affinity transport and blocked the fluorescence response to low nitrate. NiTrac was used for characterizing side chains considered important for substrate interaction, proton coupling, and regulation. We observed a striking correlation between transport activity and sensor output. Coexpression of NiTrac with known calcineurin-like proteins (CBL1, 9; CIPK23) and candidates identified in an interactome screen (CBL1, KT2, WNKinase 8) blocked NiTrac1 responses, demonstrating the suitability for in vivo analysis of activity and regulation. The new technology is applicable in plant and medical research."

Substrate addition to yeast expressing transporter fusions with yellow fluorescent protein and mCerulean triggered substrate-dependent donor quenching or resonance energy transfer. Fluorescence changes were nitrate/peptide-specific, respectively. Like CHL1, NiTrac1 had biphasic kinetics. Mutation of T101A eliminated high-affinity transport and blocked the fluorescence response to low nitrate. NiTrac was used for characterizing side chains considered important for substrate interaction, proton coupling, and regulation. We observed a striking correlation between transport activity and sensor output. Coexpression of NiTrac with known calcineurin-like proteins (CBL1, 9; CIPK23) and candidates identified in an interactome screen (CBL1, KT2, WNKinase 8) blocked NiTrac1 responses, demonstrating the suitability for in vivo analysis of activity and regulation. The new technology is applicable in plant and medical research."

Although the transporters responsible for the uptake of nitrate ions, peptides, and ammonium ions (the main nitrogen compounds that plants acquire) have been identified, current experimental techniques cannot determine when and where a specific transporter is active within a living plant. This makes it difficult to know where to target modifications and to determine how effective they have been at each step. The nitrate transporter also acts as an antenna that measures nitrate concentration to ensure it is used optimally in the plant, but current techniques cannot show how this actually works."

                        "text": "Quantitatively, nitrogen is the single most limiting nutrient for plants. Thus, not surprisingly, maximal crop yield depends critically on nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Current practices require production of \u223c1.5 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> tons of N-fertilizer per annum, consuming \u223c1% of the world\u2019s annual energy production. Plants absorb only a fraction of the fertilizer applied to the field, leading to leaching into groundwater, polluting the environment, and damaging human health. Improvements in nitrogen use efficiency of crops are urgently required; although potential targets including uptake transporters and metabolic enzymes have been identified, successful improvements in N-efficiency are rare (<a href=\"#bib58\">McAllister et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jiang, 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Xu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Schroeder et al., 2013</a>). Overexpression of an alanine amino transferase or the transporter <i>OsPTR9</i> are two of the few examples of improved nitrogen use efficiency (<a href=\"#bib73\">Shrawat et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fang et al., 2013</a>). Ammonium, nitrate, amino acids, and di- and tripeptides serve as the major forms of inorganic and organic nitrogen for plants. Uptake occurs predominantly from the soil/rhizosphere into roots, although aerial parts of the plant are also capable of absorbing nitrogen (<a href=\"#bib58\">McAllister et al., 2012</a>). Nitrogen availability and distribution in soil vary both spatially and temporally. Inorganic nitrogen uptake is complex and involves multiple ammonium and nitrate uptake systems, typically grouped into low-affinity/high-capacity and high-affinity/low-capacity systems (<a href=\"#bib74\">Siddiqi et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wang et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">von Wir\u00e9n et al., 1997</a>). Their relative activity is influenced by both exogenous and endogenous factors. The exact sites of uptake of the various forms of nitrogen along the length of the root, the cells that are directly involved, and in vivo regulation are not well understood. Also, the exact intercellular path towards the stele is not experimentally proven. The reasons for this lack of knowledge lie in the fact that nitrogen transport is difficult to measure. Some studies rely on the analysis of the depletion of the medium, others use stable isotopes, or the <sup>13</sup>N-isotope, which has a short half-life time of \u223c10 min and requires access to a suitable supply source (<a href=\"#bib80\">Wang et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clarkson et al., 1996</a>). Most of these techniques lack spatial resolution, that is information on which cell layers and which root zones absorb the nutrient. Electrophysiological assays can provide spatial information; however, they are mostly used at accessible surfaces. Spatial information has been provided in a few studies by methods such as vibrating electrodes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Henriksen et al., 1990</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">1992</a>), positron-emitting tracer imaging systems (<a href=\"#bib57\">Matsunami et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kiyomiya et al., 2001</a>), or secondary ion mass spectrometers (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clode et al., 2009</a>). We also know little about differences in the distribution of the nitrogen forms in different root cell types or zones and with respect to cellular compartmentation. Classical approaches average total ion/metabolite levels over all cells in the sample, for example, in whole roots. Nitrate levels differ dramatically between root cell types (<a href=\"#bib86\">Zhen et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Karley et al., 2000</a>). Recently, a GFP-labeled protoplast-sorting platform was used to compare metabolomes of individual cell types in roots (<a href=\"#bib59\">Moussaieff et al., 2013</a>). This study found that the levels of small oligopeptides were comparatively higher in the epidermis and endodermis compared to other root cell types. Compartmental analyses indicated that the nitrate concentration of root vacuoles is \u223c10-fold higher compared to the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib86\">Zhen et al., 1991</a>)."

The progress in identifying transporter genes provided a new handle for addressing the mechanisms and the spatial and temporal regulation of nitrogen acquisition from a new level of detail. Three major families of transporters for inorganic nitrogen uptake (and distribution) have been identified: the NPF/POT nitrate transporter family (<a href=\"#bib49\">Leran et al., 2013</a>), NRT2 nitrate transporters (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kotur et al., 2012</a>), and the ammonium transporters of the AMT/MEP/Rh family (<a href=\"#bib78\">von Wir\u00e9n et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Andrade and Einsle, 2007</a>). In addition to their role in nitrate uptake, members of the NPF/POT (<a href=\"#bib49\">Leran et al., 2013</a>) family play important roles also in the transport of histidine, dicarboxylates, oligopeptides, and glucosinolates, and surprisingly at least three major plant hormones: auxin, ABA, and gibberellin (<a href=\"#bib45\">Krouk et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kanno et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boursiac et al., 2013</a>). Genes are valuable tools for exploring physiological functions. Analysis of RNA levels allows us to study gene regulation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gazzarrini et al., 1999</a>), for example, transcriptional GUS-fusions for determining organ and cell type specific expression and translational GFP-fusions for subcellular localization. Both classical and novel methods, including cell-specific transcriptional profiles and \u2018translatomes\u2019 provide us with new insights into differences in the expression of transporters in roots (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brady et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Mustroph et al., 2009</a>). Analysis of cell type-specific expression profiles showed that the majority of changes in nitrate-induced gene expression are cell-specific (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gifford et al., 2008</a>). Expression and purification of the proteins followed by reconstitution in vesicles or expression in heterologous systems to interrogate biochemical properties include K<sub>m</sub> and transport mechanisms. The genes can be used as a basis for structure function studies (<a href=\"#bib54\">Loqu\u00e9 et al., 2007</a>) and to obtain crystal structures (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andrade et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Doki et al., 2013</a>). We can use the genes to identify interacting proteins (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lalonde et al., 2010</a>). Importantly, the availability of genes enables us to generate specific mutants (<a href=\"#bib85\">Yuan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wang et al., 2009</a>) that provide insights into their physiological roles. However, even with this massive amount of detailed data, the key information is missing, namely the information on the activity state of a given protein in vivo. In vivo activity depends mainly on two additional parameters beyond protein abundance at a given membrane: the local concentration of the substrate/s, the status of the cell (e.g., the membrane potential and local pH as key determinants for ion transporter activity), and the status of cellular regulatory networks required for the activity of the protein in question. Again, genes can help us to find regulators and study the effect of mutations on nitrogen acquisition, but ultimately we need to be able to quantify the activity of the transporters in individual cells in vivo."

A minimally invasive tool that has proven valuable for monitoring ions and metabolite levels with high spatial and temporal resolution is genetically encoded fluorescent nanosensors (<a href=\"#bib63\">Okumoto, 2012</a>). These sensors rely on substrate binding\u2013dependent conformational rearrangements in a sensory domain.

Biochemical and structural analyses have shown that many transporters undergo conformational changes during the transport cycle (<a href=\"#bib72\">Shimamura et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jiang, 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</a>). Important in this context is that such rearrangements have been observed for many members of the MFS superfamily, including members of the NPF/POT family (<a href=\"#bib16\">Doki et al., 2013</a>). We therefore hypothesized that it should be possible to \u2018record\u2019 the conformational rearrangements that occur during the transport cycle in a similar manner as used for the engineering of the FRET sensors. The first prototype for transport activity sensors, named AmTrac, uses ammonium transporters as sensory domains for engineering transport activity sensors by inserting a circularly permutated EGFP (cpEGFP) into a conformation-sensitive position of an ammonium transporter (<a href=\"#bib14\">De Michele et al., 2013</a>). Addition of ammonium to yeast cells expressing the AmTrac sensor triggers concentration-dependent and reversible changes in fluorescence intensity (<a href=\"#bib14\">De Michele et al., 2013</a>). Whether this approach is transferable to other family proteins in different species remained to be shown. To create nitrate and peptide transport activity sensors, we fused CHL1 and four PTRs to fluorescent protein pairs, expressed the fusions in yeast, and tested their response to substrate addition (named NiTrac for nitrate transport activity and PepTrac for peptide transport activity). The five sensors responded to the addition of nitrate or peptides, respectively. The kinetics of the NiTrac1 sensor response was strikingly similar to the transport kinetics of the native CHL1; the response was specific and reversible. The new sensors were used to study structure/function relationships, to correlate effects of mutations in CHL1 and NiTrac1 on activity and sensor responses, and to observe the effect of potential regulators on the conformation of the transporter. The successful use of the sensors in yeast indicates that these new tools can be used for <i>in planta</i> analyses."

                                "text": "It is likely that the nitrate transceptor CHL1 undergoes conformational rearrangements during its transport cycle. To measure substrate-dependent conformational rearrangements, CHL1 was sandwiched between a yellow acceptor (Aphrodite) and cyan donor fluorophore (mCerulean) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Rizzo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This chimera, named NiTrac1, was expressed in yeast, followed by spectral analysis of yeast cultures in a spectrofluorimeter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The fluorophores were in F\u00f6rster distance, as evidenced by significant resonance energy transfer. If conformational rearrangements were induced by substrate addition, one might expect a change in the energy transfer rate. To our surprise, and in contrast to typical FRET sensors (e.g., glucose or glutamate [<a href=\"#bib19\">Fehr et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Okumoto et al., 2005</a>]), we observed an overall reduction in the emission intensities of both donor and acceptor, but no obvious change in FRET efficiency. Cyan FPs are typically robust compare to the yellow variants; specifically, they are less sensitive to pH changes or other ions compared to yellow variants (here Venus encoded by codon-modified Aphrodite gene sequence [<a href=\"#bib15\">Deuschle et al., 2006</a>]). However, Aphrodite emission was unaffected by nitrate when excited directly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, inset), indicating that the external nitrate triggers donor quenching in the cytosol. The sensor response can be expressed as a ratio change between the emission intensity of the sensor at CFP excitation relative to YFP emission obtained from acceptor excitation. As one may have expected, the nitrate analog chlorate that lead to the naming of CHL1 (chlorate resistance of the <i>chl1</i> mutant) (<a href=\"#bib76a\">Tsay, 1993</a>) also triggered NiTrac quenching (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The response of NiTrac1 is nitrate- and chlorate-specific; other compounds such as chloride, ammonium, divalent cations, and dipeptide had no significant effect (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). When mCerulean was replaced by the corral-derived cyan fluorescent protein mTFP (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ai et al., 2008</a>), we observed FRET, but nitrate addition had no effect on the emission of this variant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The mTFP variant, named NiTrac1c (control), therefore can serve as a control sensor for in vivo measurements. Replacement of mCerulean with eCFP, another jellyfish variant, retained the donor-quenching response to nitrate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Although we do not understand the mechanism by which nitrate triggers donor quenching, the effect is likely related to a specific property common to mCerulean and eCFP and lacking in mTFP."

One could argue that quenching occurs locally at the exit pore of the transporter directly at the plasma membrane and thus requires tethering of mCerulean to the transporter. To test whether quenching is specifically caused by nitrate, we created similar constructs for the oligopeptide transporters PTR1, 2, 4, and 5 from Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Komarova et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Tsay et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Leran et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

CHL1 is unusual in that it shows biphasic nitrate uptake kinetics (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Liu and Tsay, 2003</a>). The observed dual-affinity in oocytes had been attributed to phosphorylation of T101 by endogenous kinase (<a href=\"#bib53\">Liu and Tsay, 2003</a>). The phosphorylation hypothesis would suggest that about half of the transporter molecules are phosphorylated. Interestingly, we observed that the kinetics of the fluorescence response of NiTrac1 in yeast were also biphasic (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Since it is unlikely that yeast also partially phosphorylates the transporter, the biphasic kinetics are more likely an intrinsic property of the protein. Mutation of T101 to alanine had been shown to eliminate the high-affinity component (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Liu and Tsay, 2003</a>). Introduction of T101A into NiTrac1 also eliminated the high-affinity component, intimating that NiTrac1 is a transport activity sensor, and that conformational rearrangements during the transport cycle affect mCerulean emission (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Interestingly, the transport K<sub>m</sub>s of both high- and low-affinity phases matched the values obtained for the fluorescence response, supporting the hypothesis that NiTrac measures the transport activity.

                                "text": "To study the NiTrac mechanism in more detail and to identify residues important for the transport function of the transporter and sensor, we generated a homology model for CHL1 on the basis of crystal structures of bacterial proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter homologs (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019) and predicted potentially functionally important residues structurally close to the substrate binding pocket from the predicted structure and from sequence alignments. We specifically targeted residues that might be important for substrate specificity, residues involved in proton cotransport, and salt bridges possibly involved in dynamic movements during the transport cycle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). As one may have expected, different mutants showed different energy transfer ratios, consistent with conformational differences (altered distance and/or orientation of the fluorophores in the absence of substrate; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Interestingly, we not only observed cases in which donor quenching was lost, but also changes that are consistent with changes in FRET efficiency in response to ligand addition, as well as mixtures of donor quenching and change in the FRET efficiency (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). However, without knowledge of the effect of the mutations on transport activity, the data are difficult to interpret. Therefore, we introduced the corresponding mutations into CHL1, expressed the mutants in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes and used two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), and <sup>15</sup>N-uptake (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) to measure the transport activity. In response to nitrate addition, CHL1 expressing oocytes showed an inward current, consistent with the proposed 2H<sup>+</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> cotransport mechanism. CHL1 contains a highly conserved motif E41-E44-R45 in TM1 predicted to play a role in proton coupling (<a href=\"#bib61\">Newstead, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Newstead et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Doki et al., 2013</a>). Mutations in this motif in the oligopeptide transporters PepT<sub>St</sub> (from <i>Streptococcus thermophiles</i> [<a href=\"#bib75\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>]), PepT<sub>So</sub>, PepT<sub>So2</sub> (both from <i>Shewanella oneidensis)</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Newstead, 2011</a>), and GkPOT (from <i>Geobacillus kaustophilus)</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Doki et al., 2013</a>) typically lost proton-driven transport activity. We therefore tested the role of residues in this motif using NiTrac expressed in yeast and CHL1 expressed on oocytes. Mutation in any of the three residues (E41A, E44A, and R45A, TM1) led to a loss of nitrate-induced currents and <sup>15</sup>N-uptake in both the high- and low-affinity range (0.5/0.25 and 10 mM) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5, 6</a>). The corresponding mutant of NiTrac1 also lost the sensor response to nitrate addition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B, 7</a>), indicating that the conserved motif is also used for proton cotransport of nitrate. Interestingly, the mutant was characterized by higher FRET compared to wild-type CHL1, indicating that the mutation leads to a conformational change in the protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Structural and functional analyses of the bacterial peptide transporter PepT<sub>St</sub> had implicated a salt bridge between a conserved K126 in TM4 and E400 in TM10 in peptide recognition and/or structural movements during the transport cycle (<a href=\"#bib75\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>). This lysine is conserved throughout the POT family (K164 of CHL1, TM4) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Newstead, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Newstead et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Doki et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with results from the bacterial PepT<sub>St</sub> and GkPOT, mutation of K164 to alanine or aspartate in CHL1 completely abolished nitrate uptake in both the high- and low-affinity range (0.25 and 10 mM) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>); however, the nitrate-dependent inward currents were retained (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Mutation K136A in GkPOT and K126A in PepT<sub>St</sub> both abolished completely proton-driven uptake but still had counterflow activities (<a href=\"#bib16\">Doki et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>). Both CHL1-K164 mutants either function as nitrate-dependent proton channels or have lost selectivity, and consistent with the shift of the reversal potential to more negative values transport other anions such as chloride. NiTrac1-K164A surprisingly showed a different response mode, that is upon addition of nitrate the mutant not only showed donor quenching but apparently also a change in FRET efficiency, underlining the exceptional sensitivity of NiTrac1 to effects of mutations on conformation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Mutation of the salt bridge acceptor E476A in TM10 of CHL1 led to loss of both the nitrate-induced inward current and <sup>15</sup>N-uptake (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5, 6</a>) and NiTrac lost the sensor response to addition of nitrate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>); by contrast, and as one might expect, the conservative mutation E476D had no significant effect on transport properties and sensor response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B, 5, and 6</a>). Alanine substitutions were introduced into corresponding sites predicted to be in the vicinity of the substrate-binding pocket (L49, Q358, and Y388 in TM1, TM7, and TM8, respectively). Consistent with the results obtained for the corresponding residue (N342 in TM8) in GKPOT (<a href=\"#bib16\">Doki et al., 2013</a>), Y388A had no detectable effect on the nitrate-induced inward currents, <sup>15</sup>N-uptake, and sensor response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B, 5, and 6</a>), indicating the residue Y388 may not be involved in nitrate binding or transport cycle of CHL1. Mutation of L49 in TM1 and Q358 in TM7 of CHL1 to alanine had no significant effect on nitrate-induced inward currents and <sup>15</sup>N-uptake (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5, 6</a>), but NiTrac responses were characterized by a mixture of donor quenching and FRET change (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Based on the protein sequence alignments, CHL1 carries an extended cytoplasmic loop connecting the N- and C-terminal six helical bundles. To test the role of this loop, a triple mutant E264A-E266A-K267A was analyzed. The triple mutant lost specifically the low-affinity component nitrate-induced inward current and <sup>15</sup>N uptake but retained the high-affinity component (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5, 6</a>), implicating the charged residues in the extended loop in the regulation of nitrate uptake affinity. Similarly, the corresponding NiTrac1 mutant also lost the sensor response to high nitrate concentrations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Together, these data show that NiTrac1 is a sensitive tool for reporting conformational changes in mutants and further support the hypothesis that NiTrac1 reports activity states of the transporter."

We hypothesized that binding of regulatory proteins or signaling proteins might affect the fluorescence properties of NiTrac1. Therefore, we tested whether coexpression of the known interactor CIPK23, which can phosphorylate CHL1 at T101 in in vitro assays, would affect the properties of NiTrac1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). CIPK23 did not change the energy transfer between the fluorophores in the absence of nitrate, but blocked the fluorescence response of NiTrac1 to nitrate addition (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), either by stoichiometric binding or by phosphorylation of T101. The coactivator CBL9, which did not affect CHL1 transport activity on its own but enhanced the CIPK23-mediated phosphorylation of CHL1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ho et al., 2009</a>), had no detectable effect on the fluorescence response of NiTrac1 by itself (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). By contrast, CIPK8, which is nitrate inducible in a CHL1-dependent fashion, did not affect the Nitrac1 response. However, CBL1 on its own also blocked the Nitrac1 response to nitrate addition (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). The analysis of coexpression of NiTrac1 with combinations of CIPKs and CBLs will require a different approach since episomal expression of three partners likely will create high variability due to copy number variance."

The five proteins were fused with yellow and cyan versions of GFP at their N- and C-termini, respectively. When expressed in yeast, the sensors respond to substrate addition either by donor quenching or by a FRET change. The most striking feature of NiTrac is the biphasic response kinetic that matches the dual-affinity transport properties of the protein strikingly well. Based on a predicted structural model and sequence alignments, we mutated select amino acids. Analysis of the fluorescence response of these mutants and comparison with transport assays provides us with insights into the structure-function relationship of the CHL1 nitrate transceptor. The sensor is also used for probing structural rearrangements that occur when NiTrac is coexpressed with putative regulators and interactors, and we discovered new candidate regulatory proteins. The engineering of a suite of nitrate and peptide transport activity sensors complements our recent work in which we developed the prototype for fluorescence-based activity sensors AmTrac and MepTrac by inserting circularly permutated EGFP into conformation-sensitive positions of ammonium transporters. Addition of ammonium to yeast cells expressing the AmTrac/MepTrac sensors triggered concentration-dependent and reversible changes in fluorescence intensity (<a href=\"#bib14\">De Michele et al., 2013</a>). Together, the engineering of activity sensors through two different approaches: insertion of a fluorophore into a conformationally sensitive site in AMT/MEPs and terminal fusions of a fluorophore pair to the NPF/POT family proteins indicate the potential to transfer the concept to other transporters, receptors, and enzymes. This suite of genetically encoded sensors provides a unique set of tools for observing the activity of individual transporter family members in intact tissue layers of intact plants."

At present, we do not understand the molecular basis of nitrate-induced donor quenching, which appears to affect mCerulean and CFP, but not mTFP. The fact that three PepTracs show a similar quenching effect when dipeptides are added may indicate that the quenching is caused by a conformational rearrangement in the transporter. A more detailed biophysical characterization may shed light on this unexpected behavior of the sensors. (iii) The change in the emission ratio of the two fluorophores upon substrate addition in PepTrac4 is likely caused by a change in the resonance energy transfer as had been observed for small molecule sensors (<a href=\"#bib63\">Okumoto, 2012</a>). In certain cases, that is, NiTrac1 mutants L49A and Q358A (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), we observed a mixture of donor quenching and FRET changes. We thus hypothesize that both NiTracs and all four PepTracs have the potential to report in two different modes, that is, donor quenching, a FRET change or a combination thereof."

One of the most striking features of NiTrac1 is that it reflects the biphasic kinetics of CHL1 and that even the transport and fluorescence response constants are highly similar. Mutagenesis of T101 to alanine, which had been shown to specifically affect the high-affinity component of nitrate uptake, also specifically eliminated the high-affinity response in NiTrac1. These findings strongly supported the notion that NiTrac reports the processes that occur in the transceptor, when it binds and/or transports nitrate. The observations also intimate that the dual-affinity is not caused by partial phosphorylation of CHL1 when expressed in oocytes, as suggested by Tsay\u2019s group (<a href=\"#bib53\">Liu and Tsay, 2003</a>), but more likely represent an intrinsic property of CHL1 since they also occur when NiTrac1 is expressed in yeast. CHL1 also functions as nitrate sensor to regulate transcription of a variety of genes including that of the high-affinity nitrate transporter NRT2 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ho et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, the transport and signaling activities of CHL1 can be decoupled by Pro492L in the loop connecting TM10 and 11 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ho et al., 2009</a>). It will thus be interesting to introduce this mutation into NiTrac1 and monitor the effect on the sensor output."

Specifically, we analyzed the role of the putative proton-coupling motif 41ExxER45; the role of charged residues in the extended loop R264R266K267; and residues in the substrate binding pocket as well as a predicted a salt bridge L49, K164, Q358, Y388, and E476 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Newstead, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Newstead et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Solcan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Doki et al., 2013</a>). We observed three main types of response (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>): (i) loss of both nitrate uptake activity and loss of the sensor response in E41A, E44A, R45A, and E476A; (ii) loss of either high- or low-affinity uptake activity and correlated loss of the respective sensor response in T101A and R264A/R266A/K267A; and (iii) maintenance of the nitrate uptake activity and sensor response in L49A, Y388A, Q358A, and E476D. Relative to NiTrac1, more than half of the mutants show a change in FRET between the two fluorophores in the absence of substrate addition. Consistent with the role of E41 and E44 in proton coupling for bacterial peptide transporters, the fluorescence response of E41A, E44A, and R45A NiTrac1 variants support a similar role in the nitrate transporter CHL1. Interestingly, L49A, which did not show detectable differences in transport activity, showed a mixture of donor quenching and FRET change in response to nitrate addition, demonstrating that NiTrac1 is exquisitely sensitive for detecting changes in the overall protein conformation. R45A lost transport activity but retained a FRET change response after the addition of substrate rather than showing a quenching response, indicating an overall conformational change due to binding of nitrate in the absence of a functional transport cycle. Interestingly, mutation of charged residues in the extended cytoplasmic loop of CHL1 (R264A/R266A/K267A) specifically affected the low-affinity component in sensor and uptake response, implicating the loop, potentially through interacting proteins that can tune activity. How T101 phosphorylation, which affects the behavior of CHL1/NiTrac1 at low nitrate levels cooperates with the cytosolic loop, which appears to specifically affect the behavior in high nitrate conditions will be interesting to address in future experiments. Based on our studies, we presume that K164, Q358, and E476 may participate in nitrate binding. Consistent with data from bacterial peptide transporters, E476A lost both sensor response and uptake activity. This conserved residue aspartate likely plays a role in the binding pocket and/or salt bridge formation that is important for the substrate transport cycle. Mutants carrying K164A/D and Q385A mutations were both characterized by significantly increased nitrate-dependent inward currents. It will be interesting to further explore the cause for the increased conductivity with respect to transported ion species. Although the data from the limited number of mutants do not allow us to draw conclusions on the exact molecular nature of the conformational changes, we nevertheless provide the first evidence that activity sensors are highly sensitive and simple tools for probing structure-function relationships in heterologous and homologous systems without the necessity to purify the transporters."

Here we show that activity sensors can be used to probe such interactions with exquisite sensitivity. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that coexpression of the calcium-dependent kinase CIPK23, which is phosphorylating T101 of CHL1 and thereby inhibiting the low-affinity component of CHL1, can block the fluorescence response when coexpressed with NiTrac1. Although typically CIPKs are thought to require a CBL for substrate recognition and derepression of the autoinhibition, CIPK23 had been shown to be able to interact with CHL1 on its own and trigger at least partial phosphorylation of T101 in vitro (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ho et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, although CBL9 had been shown to enhance the CIPK-mediated phosphorylation of T101, we did not observe an effect of coexpression of CBL on NiTrac1. Surprisingly, and despite the high sequence identity between AtCBL9 and AtCBL1 (\u223c89% identity), CBL1 but not CBL9 inhibited the nitrate response of NiTrac1. AtCBL1 and 9 have been shown to regulate a variety of processes including potassium uptake, pollen germination, as well as sugar-, hormone- and ROS-signaling (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sagi and Fluhr, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Xu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cheong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hashimoto and Kudla, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Drerup et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kimura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Li, 2013a</a>). Even though CBL1 and 9 have apparent overlapping functions, they can have specific effects, for example, the AtCBL1-AtCIPK1 complex is involved in ABA-dependent stress responses, whereas the AtCBL9-AtCIPK1 complex plays roles in ABA-independent stress responses (<a href=\"#bib17\">Drerup et al., 2013</a>). In general, CIPKs depend on their coactivator-CBLs to activate CIPK kinase activity. However, recent studies showed that full-length CIPK23, CIPK16, or CIPK6 alone can activate the AKT1 potassium channel system (<a href=\"#bib49a\">Li et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47a\">Lee et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19a\">Fujii et al., 2009</a>). Also, AtCBL10 interacts with AKT1 to regulate potassium homeostasis without binding to any AtCIPKs (<a href=\"#bib67\">Ren et al., 2013</a>). The assays deployed here use strong promoters and high copy number plasmids. It will therefore be important to test whether low levels of the kinase are sufficient for inhibiting NiTrac1. It will also be interesting to compare the responses of NiTrac1 when expressed in mutant plants lacking components of the CBL-CIPK machinery."

That is indeed odd, given that CHL stands for chlorate resistance. It is noteworthy that Arnold Bloom (Kosola and Bloom, 1996), one of the prominent physiologists in this field, and others have reported that inhibition of nitrate uptake by nitrate was not competitive, therefore questioning the mechanism of chlorate transport. These experiments were performed in planta, where the situation is likely complex. Bloom concluded that chlorate is not a good analog for tracer studies in planta. Nevertheless, we tested the effect of chlorate on NiTrac1 and observe a similar quenching response, even quantitatively, for chlorate as observed for nitrate. These data are now shown in the new panel as <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> (subsequent figure sections are the same, just renumbered). Thus the new data address the point raised by the reviewers."
