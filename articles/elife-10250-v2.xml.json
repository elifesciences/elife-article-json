Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, and much of the published literature has focused on neoplastic cell-autonomous processes for these adaptations. We demonstrate that exosomes secreted by patient-derived CAFs can strikingly reprogram the metabolic machinery following their uptake by cancer cells. We find that CAF-derived exosomes (CDEs) inhibit mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, thereby increasing glycolysis and glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation in cancer cells. Through 13C-labeled isotope labeling experiments we elucidate that exosomes supply amino acids to nutrient-deprived cancer cells in a mechanism similar to macropinocytosis, albeit without the previously described dependence on oncogenic-Kras signaling. Using intra-exosomal metabolomics, we provide compelling evidence that CDEs contain intact metabolites, including amino acids, lipids, and TCA-cycle intermediates that are avidly utilized by cancer cells for central carbon metabolism and promoting tumor growth under nutrient deprivation or nutrient stressed conditions."

Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, and much of the published literature has focused on neoplastic cell-autonomous processes for these adaptations. We demonstrate that exosomes secreted by patient-derived CAFs can strikingly reprogram the metabolic machinery following their uptake by cancer cells. We find that CAF-derived exosomes (CDEs) inhibit mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, thereby increasing glycolysis and glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation in cancer cells. Through 13C-labeled isotope labeling experiments we elucidate that exosomes supply amino acids to nutrient-deprived cancer cells in a mechanism similar to macropinocytosis, albeit without the previously described dependence on oncogenic-Kras signaling. Using intra-exosomal metabolomics, we provide compelling evidence that CDEs contain intact metabolites, including amino acids, lipids, and TCA-cycle intermediates that are avidly utilized by cancer cells for central carbon metabolism and promoting tumor growth under nutrient deprivation or nutrient stressed conditions."

Although the TME is comprised of a variety of cell types including cancer-associated fibroblasts cells (CAFs), immune cells, and angiogenic elements, CAFs are the major constituent of the TME in many cancers (<a href=\"#bib51\">Whiteside, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Allinen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Feig et al., 2012</a>).

Our results demonstrate that patient-derived CDEs reprogram cancer cell metabolism through disabling mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and providing <i>de novo</i> 'off the shelf'\u00a0metabolites through exosomal cargo. Specifically, we find that inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by CDEs is associated with a compensatory increase in glycolysis. Interestingly, the inhibition of electron transport chain by CDEs significantly increased glutamine\u2019s reductive carboxylation for biosynthesis in cancer cells. Further, we demonstrate through isotope tracing and intra-exosomal metabolomic experiments that exosomes act as a source of metabolite cargo carrying lactate, acetate, amino acids, TCA cycle intermediates, and lipids; and these metabolites are utilized by recipient cancer cells for proliferation, precursor metabolites and replenishing levels of TCA cycle metabolites. Notably, we demonstrate in wild-type and activated Kras-expressing pancreatic cancer cells that the metabolite cargo delivery mechanism by exosomes is similar to macropinocytosis, albeit without the previously described dependence on oncogenic Kras signaling (<a href=\"#bib7\">Commisso et al., 2013</a>). Our results reveal a novel metabolism-centric regulatory role of TME-secreted exosomes in cancers and we uncover the underlying mode of action of this regulation.

We isolated exosomes from the conditioned media of CAFs derived from a prostate cancer patient and cultured prostate cancer cells in the presence of freshly isolated exosomes. CDEs enhanced proliferation of PC3 cells with increasing exosomes concentration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To determine whether CDEs induce metabolic rewiring in cancer cells, we cultured PC3 cells in CDEs for 24\u2009hr and measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) with increasing amounts of exosomes. Surprisingly, we observed that basal oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS, indicated by OCR) was significantly inhibited with increasing concentration of CDEs added to PC3 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To ascertain whether the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration of cancer cells is specific to CDEs and to prove similar behavior is not exhibited with exosomes derived from other cells, we isolated exosomes from prostate cancer cell line (PC3), human fibroblasts (IMR-90), and also used blank media for isolation method control (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As seen in the figure, exosomes from control conditions were ineffective in modulating cancer cells\u2019 OCR. To expand our observations, we next isolated exosomes from three independent prostate cancer patient CAFs and cultured four prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, DU145, 22RV1 and E006AA) in presence and absence of the exosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Remarkably, exogenous addition of CDEs reduced OCR in all prostate cancer cell lines. To confirm if this reduction of OCR in cancer cells was indeed because of uptake of exosomes, we added the endocytosis inhibitor Cytochalasin D (CytoD) in PC3 culture media along with CDEs. CytoD has been shown to inhibit exosome uptake in various cell systems (<a href=\"#bib4\">Casella et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Feng et al., 2010</a>). Notably, CytoD could partially rescue this reduction of OCR in PC3 cells, thus confirming the CAF exosomes mediated reduction of OCR in cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

We measured miRNA levels in the CDEs to determine whether miRNA underlay the molecular mechanism by which the exosomes exert the metabolic changes we observed. We extracted miRNAs from purified CDEs from three patients and measured the levels of a panel of 800 human miRNAs using NanoString technology. We grouped the miRNA by whether or not they target genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (miRNA-mRNA interactions taken from starBase v2.0, starbase.sysu.edu.cn). The relative abundance of miRNAs that target oxidative phosphorylation genes is higher in exosomes than most other miRNA as seen in the density distribution plot (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). The top 30 most abundant miRNAs across the exosomes sampled, target one or more OXPHOS genes, which is validated by measuring the decrease in mRNA levels of these genes after treatment with exosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). The miRNAs and their targets that we have identified are based on experimental miRNA abundance data from Nanostring assays followed by miRNA target prediction integrated with AGO-CLIP-SEQ data (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2014</a>). In order to confirm the inhibition of OXPHOS through miRNA we co-transfected mir-22, let7a and mir-125b present in the group of miRNA targeting OXPHOS, in PC3 cells, and measured OCR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>). In line with our hypothesis, we see a decrease in OCR in PC3 cells co-transfected with miRNAs. Although, the reduction of OCR is moderate, this is due to the technical limitation of co-transfection experiments which can only allow using a small subset of the miRNAs that target OXPHOS in PC3. In summary, these results suggest that CDEs reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and induced metabolic alterations in cancer cells mimicking hypoxia-induced alterations."

GC-MS results are reported as mass isotopologue distributions (MIDs), which represent the relative abundance of different mass isotopologues of each metabolite; where M0 refers to the isotopologue with all <sup>12</sup>C atoms and M1 and higher refer to heavier isotopologues with one or more <sup>13</sup>C atoms derived from the tracer. It is well established that isotope tracer analysis can reveal the alterations in contributions of a substrate within a particular metabolic pathway (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). We found that the CDEs increased the lactate levels in the cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Further, the percentage of M3 pyruvate and M3 lactate was increased due to CDEs; however, there is a corresponding decrease in the percentage of M2 citrate and M3 citrate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G-I</a>). The increase of M3 pyruvate and M3 lactate indicates higher contribution of glucose to pyruvate and lactate in prostate cancer cells conditioned with CDEs. Moreover, there was a decrease of M0 pyruvate and M0 lactate with a corresponding increase of M1 pyruvate and M1 lactate, thus suggesting that the exosomes enhance glycolysis. The latter conclusion was based on the principle that M1 pyruvate is only produced by glucose-6-phosphate metabolized by phospho glucoisomerase. Consistent with the decreased OXPHOS observed in cancer cells due to CDEs, the percentage of M2 citrate, M2 \u03b1-ketoglutarate, M2 fumarate, M2 malate, and M2 glutamate was also significantly reduced in cancer cells in presence of CDEs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I\u2013M</a>). In line with our observations, the percentage of <sup>13</sup>C \u03b1-ketoglutarate from <sup>13</sup>C labeled glucose was significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3N</a>). This further confirms that CDEs decreased the percentage contribution of glucose to a-ketoglutarate in cancer cells and instead diverted it towards lactate. The above results conclusively show that CDEs induce a Warburg type phenotype in cancer cells, by disabling normal oxidative mitochondrial function with a compensatory increase in glycolysis."

The increased ratio of \u03b1-ketoglutarate to citrate was recently shown to promote reductive glutamine metabolism and it correlated with reductive glutamine\u2019s contribution to citrate (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fendt et al., 2013</a>). The inhibition of respiratory chain components, or hypoxic conditions, was found to increase this ratio. Consistent with previous reports, the ratio of M4/M5 citrate, which represents the ratio of glutamine to citrate through oxidative metabolism over reductive metabolism, confirmed our above results that there is a significant increase in glutamine\u2019s reductive metabolism in presence of exosomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H\u2013I</a>). This is further substantiated through significant increase in the percentage contribution of glutamine through reductive pathway in the TCA cycle in cancer cells in presence of exosomes when compared to control condition.

Therefore, to further investigate the effect of exogenous CDEs on nutritional substrates\u2019 incorporation into lipogenesis; we used U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> glucose or U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub> glutamine to estimate their conversion to cytosolic acetyl-CoA, which is the precursor for palmitate (fatty acid) synthesis. Similar to our earlier observation that CDEs reduced glucose contribution to TCA cycle metabolites in cancer cells, we found that exosomes also decreased glucose contribution to palmitate. This is evident from the shift in high mass isotopologues of palmitate to lower mass isotopologues derived from U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> glucose, when cells are cultured with exosomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). Conversely, there is a shift in the reverse direction, i.e. from low to high mass palmitate isotopologues derived from U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub> glutamine, in presence of CDEs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a>). To quantify the percentage contribution of these substrates to the lipogenic acetyl-CoA pool, we performed isotopologue spectral analysis (ISA)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib36\">Metallo, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kamphorst et al., 2014</a>).

More importantly, there is a two-fold increase in glutamine\u2019s contribution to lipogenic acetyl-CoA via the reductive carboxylation pathway.

To ascertain if acetate contributed to fatty acid synthesis, we measured acetate content in media (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4M</a>). Indeed, acetate concentrations were detected in our cancer cell media at significant levels. Since pyruvate was available in significant amounts in our cancer cell culture media, we included it in our estimates for palmitate synthesis. In order to quantify contribution from these alternative sources, we performed tracer experiments with U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub> pyruvate and U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub> acetate in cancer cells cultured with and without exosomes. We found that their contribution to lipogenic acetyl-CoA is significantly lower when compared to that of glucose and glutamine.

ISA results confirm these observations, where cancer cells cultured with CDEs showed an increase in acetate\u2019s contribution with a concomitant decrease in pyruvate\u2019s contribution to palmitate production (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4P</a>). These experiments collectively substantiate that exosomes have a significant effect on fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells by switching the carbon source from the oxidative glucose pathway to glutamine via the reductive carboxylation pathway in the TCA cycle."

Results from the previous sections indicate that exosomes may act as a source of metabolites and proliferating cancer cells use these metabolites for lipogenesis. To ascertain whether exosomes contain significant amount of <i>de novo</i> metabolites, we first measured lactate and acetate contained inside the prostate and pancreatic CDEs. We included intra-exosomal metabolic measurements of pancreatic CAFs in order to generalize our conclusions. Notably, we found high amounts of lactate and acetate in both prostate and pancreatic CDEs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). This suggests that exosomes can not only replenish TCA cycle metabolites but also act as source of lipids. Further, to prove these hypotheses we performed GC-MS analysis for intra-exosomal metabolites and found high concentrations of citrate and pyruvate along with significant presence of \u03b1-ketoglutarate, fumarate and malate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). To further expand our findings, we performed ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), and found markedly high levels of glutamine, arginine, glutamate, proline, alanine, threonine, serine, asparagine, valine, and leucine in prostate CAF exosomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Additionally, in pancreatic CDEs, we found high levels of glutamine, threonine, phenylalanine, valine, isoleucine, glycine, arginine, and serine (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>).

Having established that CDEs could act as a source of metabolites, we further postulated that CDEs could act as source of TCA cycle metabolites for cancer cells. To establish whether metabolites contained in exosomes could fuel TCA cycle, we cultured patient-derived fibroblasts with <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose, glutamine, pyruvate, leucine, lysine, and phenylalanine for 72\u2009hr. We selected leucine, lysine and phenylalanine for labeling, because these were the most abundant amino acids in human serum albumin (<a href=\"#bib43\">Saifer and Palo, 1969</a>). The extended timescale of 72\u2009hr was adopted to allow detectable incorporation of labeling in proteins, amino acids, and lipids, and their compartmentalization within exosomal cargo. We then isolated labeled exosomes from the CAF culture spent medium. We postulated that nutrient deprived conditions will enhance cancer cells\u2019 dependence on the nutrient cargo in exosomes and therefore tested our hypothesis under both nutrient replete and nutrient deprived conditions. The isolated CDEs were then spiked into complete or nutrient-deprived (without lysine, leucine, phenylalanine, glutamine, and pyruvate) cultures of prostate cancer cells for 48h. The intracellular metabolites were isolated from cancer cells and their 13C enrichment was determined. Notably, our results substantiate that exosomes can supply metabolites to cancer cells under both complete and nutrient deprivation conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). However, and in concordance with hypothesis, we found that there is a significant increase in the contribution of CDEs to cancer cells\u2019 metabolites pools in nutrient deprived conditions, as compared to complete medium cultures. To definitively prove the direct export of metabolites by exosomes, we measured MIDs of metabolites in cancer cells when cultured with <sup>13</sup>C labeled exosomes. We detected substantial labeling of intracellular amino acids in cancer cells, which included M5 glutamine, M6 lysine, and M6 leucine. We also detected M5 glutamate derived from mitochondrial glutaminolysis and labeled TCA cycle metabolites from labeled <sup>13</sup>C-glutamine supplied by CDEs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Further, it is important to note that substrates within CDEs will not be fully <sup>13</sup>C labeled since 72\u2009hr are not sufficient for CAFs to undergo at least one replication, and hence labeled metabolites in CDEs may be diluted with pre-existent unlabeled (M0) isoforms. This results in small, but significant levels of labeled metabolites within the cancer cells. Importantly, it provides a compelling proof-of-concept that CDEs can supply TCA cycle metabolites to cancer cells."

The deprivation and labeling conditions used were similar to <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>. In order to quantify the contribution of metabolites from exosomes to cancer cells, we calculated the mean enrichment of <sup>13</sup>C labeled amino acids and normalized them with their corresponding enrichment in exosomes. We observed that exosomes account for approximately 16% of phenylalanine, 14% of glutamine, 12% of lysine and 5% of leucine pools in PC3 cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Since MIDs are measured 48\u2009hr after introduction of exosomes to cancer cells, several of the supplied metabolites would have been catabolized into other intermediates or incorporated into biomass precursors. Therefore, it is important to note that the contributions of essential amino acids estimated would be lower than their total contribution from exosomes over the course of 48\u2009hr. In order to achieve higher detection of labeled isoforms, CAFs will have to be cultured with labeled substrates for multiple passages to completely replace unlabeled metabolite pools with their labeled isoforms. Nevertheless, these results substantiate that CDEs are key player in enriching metabolite pools in cancer cells under nutrient deprived conditions seen in the TME."

Similar to CytoD, heparin has been recently shown to inhibit uptake of exosomes by cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Christianson et al., 2013</a>). CDEs were able to rescue reduction of proliferation under nutrient deprivation conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). However, this rescue effect is reduced to varying extents by adding CytoD, heparin and lysosomal degradation inhibitor choloroquine (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Similarly, addition of macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA also counters the rescue of CDEs under deprivation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). These data suggest that uptake of exosomes and release of their cargo is necessary to rescue cell proliferation under nutrient deprived conditions. Taken together, these results provide evidence that CDEs can reprogram cancer cells\u2019 metabolism by acting as source of amino acids under nutrient depleted conditions in the TME."

Our results were similar to the process of macropinocytosis, which was revealed as a mechanism to supply amino acids through extracellular proteins in oncogenic Ras-expressing pancreatic cancer cells. To expand the scope of our findings and understand whether Ras can similarly promote the supply of metabolites by CDEs in pancreatic cancer cells, we isolated exosomes from pancreatic CAFs cell line (CAF-19) and used them to study their metabolic influence in two pancreatic cancer cell lines: BxPC3 (wild type Kras) and MiaPaCa-2 (homozygous Kras). Since it was observed that CDEs supply metabolites to prostate cancer cells, we cultured both BxPC3 and MiaPaCa-2 cell lines, with and without CDEs under complete media and nutrient deprivation (without glutamine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, and pyruvate) conditions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Notably, CDEs could rescue loss of proliferation in both cancer cell lines, thereby suggesting that internalization or uptake and supply of exosomes derived metabolites in cancer cells is Kras independent. Furthermore, this rescue of proliferation by CDEs in pancreatic cancer cell lines was inhibited by receptor mediated endocytosis inhibitor heparin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>)."

While much of the mechanistic underpinnings in this regard have focused on cell autonomous means of metabolic reprogramming, the objective of this study was to examine the critical role of TME, and in particular, CAFs, might be playing in this adaptive phenomenon. CAFs comprise the majority of cell types within the TME, and their reciprocal interactions with cancer cells have been well documented (<a href=\"#bib51\">Whiteside, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hazlehurst et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Karnoub et al., 2007</a>). Recently, Hu et al. have discovered that CDEs enhance drug resistance in colorectal cancer stem cells by regulating the Wnt pathway and this effect can be reversed by inhibiting exosome secretion\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib25\">Hu et al., 2015</a>).\u00a0These studies suggest that CDEs may not only enhance cancer growth but may also induce chemoresistance. However, there continues to be sparse data vis-\u00e0-vis the role, if any, of the effects CAFs might have on altered cancer cell metabolism, and the channels of communication that enable such paracrine effects. The objective of our study was to determine whether exosomes released from CAFs might play a role in modulating cancer cell metabolism, allowing neoplastic cells to survive in the nutrient-deprived conditions, a characteristic of many tumors. Our results convincingly demonstrate that not only do exosomes enhance the phenomenon of 'Warburg effect' in tumors, but remarkably, contain <i>de novo</i> 'off-the-shelf' metabolites within their cargo that can contribute to the entire compendia of central carbon metabolism within cancer cells."

                        "text": "The Warburg effect, commonly observed characteristic of many cancer types, is identified as the reliance of cancer cells on aerobic glycolysis even under normoxia. This leads to diversion of glucose to lactate thereby creating low pH conditions which modulates TME (<a href=\"#bib49\">Warburg et al., 1927</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib22\">Gatenby et al., 2006</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib44\">Salimian Rizi et al., 2015</a>). Although recent studies (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ishikawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Santidrian et al., 2013</a>), including our own (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yang et al., 2014</a>), implicate mitochondrial activity in cancer metastasis, literature is abound with previous studies based on the hypothesis that aerobic glycolysis may be an outcome of impaired mitochondrial functions. The role of mitochondrial metabolism in tumorigenesis and cancer progression is likely to be organ-specific. Mitochondrial dysfunction could impair oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation, the urea cycle, gluconeogenesis, and apoptotic pathways (<a href=\"#bib32\">King et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Modica-Napolitano and Singh, 2004</a>). TCA cycle dysfunction leads to oncogenesis by regulating signaling pathway and stabilizing HIF1-\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Selak et al., 2005</a>). While many studies in cancer cell metabolism have highlighted higher compensatory glycolysis because of mitochondrial dysfunction; recent studies show that some tumors predominantly use glutamine under hypoxia or conditions mimicking hypoxia such as electron transport chain inhibition through reductive carboxylation for biosynthetic needs (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wise et al., 2008</a>). In reductive carboxylation, glutamine is converted to \u03b1-ketoglutarate, followed by the conversion of \u03b1-ketoglutarate to isocitrate through isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and isocitrate is converted to acetyl-CoA used for lipid synthesis. The upregulation of the reductive carboxylation pathway enhances cancer cells proliferation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Metallo, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mullen, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wise et al., 2011</a>). Although less studied, pyruvate or acetate can act as an alternative source to glucose and glutamine for lipid biosynthesis. Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA through mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), whereas acetate is transported into cells and converted to acetyl-CoA through acetyl-CoA synthase (<a href=\"#bib11\">De Schrijver et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Feron, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Koukourakis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pizer et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yoshimoto et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zaidi et al., 2012</a>). Acetyl-CoA is the first step in lipid biosynthesis, which serves biosynthetic needs of proliferating cells. Recent findings implicate TME in the induced metabolic rewiring in cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cairns et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fiaschi and Chiarugi, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rattigan et al., 2012</a>).

To determine this metabolic regulation, we first cultured CDEs with prostate cancer cells and performed <sup>13</sup>C based isotope tracing of metabolic fluxes and bioenergetics analysis. We have used 200\u2009\u03bcg/ml for the different types of experiments conducted herein (proliferation assays, metabolic assays and tracer experiments). The working concentration was chosen to maintain a physiological ratio of CAFs to cancer cells which is reported to be between 1 and 10 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Brauer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Delinassios, 1987</a>). A concentration of 200\u2009\u03bcg/ml corresponded to ratio between 1 and 5 CAFs per cancer cell and hence, is within the range reported in the literature. However, for different CAFs and cancer cells system this ratio should be individually estimated based on the functional effect of stromal cells on cancer cells. It is to be noted that due to protracted purification steps during exosome isolation, degradation of metabolites can occur and hence, replenishment of exosomes for functional studies was followed and recommended. Additionally, to minimize degradation of metabolites in exosomes, we used fresh exosomes for all the experiments and avoided any freeze-thaw cycle in exosomes that were introduced to cancer cells cultures. Intriguingly, cancer cells cultured with exosomes had significantly reduced OXPHOS with a concomitant increase in glycolysis. Our results were further corroborated by observations regarding higher glucose uptake and lactate secretion by cancer cells in the presence of exosomes. We show for the first time that stromal exosomes shift cellular metabolism towards glycolysis in cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). We further extended these observations in prostate cancer to pancreatic cancer and found similar inhibitory effect of pancreatic CDEs on mitochondrial respiration. Interestingly, this regulation was Kras independent in pancreatic cancers. In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, we observe a reduction of OCR in PC3 cells co-transfected with miR-22, let7a and miR-25b, in line with our hypothesis of the inhibitory effect of miRNAs from CDEs. However, the caveat associated with this is that due to limitations in genome engineering technologies, it is extremely difficult to insert multiple miRNAs in exosomes or transfect multiple miRNAs together without causing significant toxicity. Nonetheless, our results show that abundant miRNA in exosomes that have been previously shown to target OXPHOS, indeed cause inhibition of oxygen consumption in our system. In light of these results we believe further studies are needed to uncover the mechanism of ETC inhibition by CDEs-derived miRNAs that are out of scope for this study."

To unravel the contribution of major nutrients to cancer cells, we performed <sup>13</sup>C based metabolite tracing and isotopologue spectral analysis (ISA). Indeed, CDEs upregulated reductive carboxylation of glutamine in cancer cells. Previous reports showed that reductive carboxylation is a critical pathway to support the growth of tumor cells under hypoxia (<a href=\"#bib36\">Metallo, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mullen, 2012</a>). This suggests that CDEs create hypoxia mimicking environment in cancer cells leading to an increase in reductive carboxylation of glutamine in cancer cells. Our ISA results of glucose and glutamine contribution to acetyl-CoA, a precursor for fatty acid synthesis, confirmed the increased reliance of cancer cells on reductive glutamine metabolism in presence of stromal exosomes. However, we were not able to balance palmitate synthesis through glucose and glutamine in cancer cells cultured with CDEs, which led us to measure contributions of acetate and pyruvate. Consistent with recent reports that acetate in media could serve as source of lipid synthesis in cancer cells, we found that acetate could contribute between 10\u201315% towards lipogenesis. However, pyruvate contribution was much lower and was between 3\u20138% in cancer cells. These results suggested that exosomes themselves might be acting as source of metabolites in a manner similar to macropinocytosis observed recently in Kras expressing pancreatic cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Commisso et al., 2013</a>).

We provide previously unidentified evidence that these nutrients can enrich cancer cells under nutrient deprived or nutrient stress conditions. To label the metabolites, proteins and lipids contained in exosomes, we cultured CAFs in media supplemented with<sup>13</sup>C-labeled amino acids dominantly found in the serum (lysine, leucine, phenylalanine, and glutamine) along with nutrients such as glucose and pyruvate. We then cultured cancer cells under nutrient deprived conditions with these labeled exosomes and found that these labeled exosomes could indeed contribute to TCA cycle metabolites in cancer cells. These results conclusively showed that TME can supply metabolites directly to cancer cells through exosomes and these metabolites indeed can fuel TCA cycle in cancer cells. Recently published article by Lyden et al (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hoshino et al., 2015</a>), showed that exosomes precondition specific organs for metastatic invasion.

After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, the media was replaced with 700\u2009\u03bcL of assay medium. Then incubate the plate at 37\u00b0C without CO<sub>2</sub> for at least 1\u2009hr. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was then measured. The endogenous coupling degree of the OXPHOS system was assessed using oligomycin (2\u2009\u03bcg/ml), an inhibitor of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATPsynthase. The uncoupled OCR was also measured in presence of 2.5\u2009\u03bcM of FCCP. Finally, the cells were treated with a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, Rotenone (2\u00a0\u03bcM) in order to assess the mitochondrial contribution to OCR. Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) can be measured in a similar way to OCR. All OCR or ECAR value was normalized with protein content of cells."

The authors used CAFs from 4 prostate cancer cell lines, a number of primary prostate cancers, as well as 2 pancreas cancer cell lines and 2 primary pancreas cancers, to show that CDEs contain an array of metabolites including amino acids, TCA cycle metabolites, fatty acids and precursors/intermediates. Delivery of these exosomes to cancer cells inhibited oxidative phosphorylation (although this in turn leads to a series of downstream sequela including increased glycolysis, TCA reductive carboxylation, etc. through metabolic labeling using 13C-glucose or glutamine). By examining gene expression profiles, the authors found a decrease in OXPHOS gene expression in prostate cancer cells exposed to CDEs. Quantitative analysis suggests that 5-29% of various prostate tumor metabolites were derived from 13C-labeled CDEs. Extending these observations, the authors demonstrate that pancreatic cancer cells could also take up CDEs via a macropinocytosis mechanism that appears independent of K-ras mutational status. A number of major issues, if addressed, would make this manuscript meritorious for publication."

The isolation of exosomes is quite protracted, opening up the possibility of artifactual changes in the metabolome. As the authors know, this is why the isolation of metabolites is extremely time sensitive and all proteins are denatured immediately with such reagents as ice cold methanol. This may be technical limitation of exosome isolation that could severely impact the results. This issue needs addressing. The quantitation of metabolites in the exosomes leads to some astronomical values per unit of protein. Perhaps this is because the exosomes are very low in protein? In a typical cell, which may be about 20% protein, the concentration of lactate of 50 umol/mg prot would correspond to a molar concentration of 10 M! The authors should carefully check this."

Why do lactate, pyruvate, and alanine, which all share the same carbon skeleton, all have different labeling patterns? How do they get to the conclusion that ~ 30% of KG is derived from exosome metabolites? It does not seem proper to normalize the KG labeling in cells to that in exosomes, when most KG in cells comes from glutamine or glutamate. It is also confusing how labeling of KG in cells would exceed glutamine and glutamate. I do not want to cause the authors excessive suffering on this point. To this end, they may be better served reporting less isotope labeling data, instead of reporting dubious data. The leucine data, for example, makes the point that the exosome contribution is modest while looking more straightforward than some other data. Similarly, it seems important to see results for glutamine. Perhaps a few well-chosen examples would suffice. Also, perhaps some funny labeling patterns can be cleaned up by more careful examination of the raw data to eliminate interfering peaks."

This may be technical limitation of exosome isolation that could severely impact the results. This issue needs addressing. The quantitation of metabolites in the exosomes leads to some astronomical values per unit of protein. Perhaps this is because the exosomes are very low in protein?

Another example of this phenomenon is the glutamate concentration inside synaptic vesicles, which can be as high as 100 mM (Danbolt, 2001). A previous study has stated (Mavelli and Stano, 2015) that during the process of micro-vesicles formation it could be possible for solutes, in this case metabolites, to become concentrated within vesicles as compared to within cells. In the aforementioned study, the authors observed this phenomenon in liposomes that are similar in size to exosomes. Hence, it is very likely that during vesicle formation process, concentrations of metabolites, proteins, etc. become higher than that in the cells. To the best of our knowledge, not much is known about concentration estimation inside exosomes. Collectively our data shows the strong effect of CDEs in the form of (a) rescue of cell viability under nutrient deprivation; (b) metabolic reprogramming of OXPHOS and reductive carboxylation; (c) cargo that supplies intact metabolites to the TCA cycle."

Since lysine is an essential amino acid, why are they seeing M+2 form? Why do lactate, pyruvate, and alanine, which all share the same carbon skeleton, all have different labeling patterns? How do they get to the conclusion that ~ 30% of KG is derived from exosome metabolites? It does not seem proper to normalize the KG labeling in cells to that in exosomes, when most KG in cells comes from glutamine or glutamate. It is also confusing how labeling of KG in cells would exceed glutamine and glutamate. I do not want to cause the authors excessive suffering on this point. To this end, they may be better served reporting less isotope labeling data, instead of reporting dubious data. The leucine data, for example, makes the point that the exosome contribution is modest while looking more straightforward than some other data. Similarly, it seems important to see results for glutamine. Perhaps a few well-chosen examples would suffice. Also, perhaps some funny labeling patterns can be cleaned up by more careful examination of the raw data to eliminate interfering peaks.</i> "

We agree with the reviewer\u2019s concern about the dissimilarity in the labeling pattern of pyruvate, alanine and lactate. This may be due to combined effect of compartmentalization of pyruvate pools, complex carbon transitions in TCA cycle and malic enzyme pathways and multiple sources of pyruvate leading to distinct labeling patterns in alanine and pyruvate. Since this experiment was performed as a proof-of-concept for showing that CDEs contribute TCA cycle metabolites to cancer cells, we now show the mass distributions of the heaviest isotopologues. The data now highlights M6 Glucose derived M3 lactate, M3 pyruvate and M3 alanine that can only be directly sourced from exosomes.

Furthermore, we agree that the \u03b1-KG contribution is 30% and much higher than that of glutamine and glutamate, it is due to the low 13C enrichment of \u03b1-KG in exosome, which results in overestimating its contribution. We had reported these values based on the suggestion made in the previous review to quantify the contribution of exosome metabolites to cancer cells. It is important to note here that due to complexity of TCA cycle pathways it becomes extremely difficult to resolve contribution of metabolites that comes directly from exosomes and that from metabolites metabolized after uptake of exosomes by cancer cells.
