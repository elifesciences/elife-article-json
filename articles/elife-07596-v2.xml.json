                    "text": "Neurons of the cerebellar nuclei (CbN) transmit cerebellar signals to premotor areas. The cerebellum expresses several autism-linked genes, including <i>GABRB3</i>, which encodes GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor \u03b23 subunits and is among the maternal alleles deleted in Angelman syndrome. We tested how this <i>Gabrb3</i> m-/p+ mutation affects CbN physiology in mice, separating responses of males and females. Wild-type mice showed sex differences in synaptic excitation, inhibition, and intrinsic properties. Relative to females, CbN cells of males had smaller synaptically evoked mGluR1/5-dependent currents, slower Purkinje-mediated IPSCs, and lower spontaneous firing rates, but rotarod performances were indistinguishable. In mutant CbN cells, IPSC kinetics were unchanged, but mutant males, unlike females, showed enlarged mGluR1/5 responses and accelerated spontaneous firing. These changes appear compensatory, since mutant males but not females performed indistinguishably from wild-type siblings on the rotarod task. Thus, sex differences in cerebellar physiology produce similar behavioral output, but provide distinct baselines for responses to mutations."

The cerebellum expresses several autism-linked genes, including <i>GABRB3</i>, which encodes GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor \u03b23 subunits and is among the maternal alleles deleted in Angelman syndrome. We tested how this <i>Gabrb3</i> m-/p+ mutation affects CbN physiology in mice, separating responses of males and females. Wild-type mice showed sex differences in synaptic excitation, inhibition, and intrinsic properties. Relative to females, CbN cells of males had smaller synaptically evoked mGluR1/5-dependent currents, slower Purkinje-mediated IPSCs, and lower spontaneous firing rates, but rotarod performances were indistinguishable. In mutant CbN cells, IPSC kinetics were unchanged, but mutant males, unlike females, showed enlarged mGluR1/5 responses and accelerated spontaneous firing. These changes appear compensatory, since mutant males but not females performed indistinguishably from wild-type siblings on the rotarod task. Thus, sex differences in cerebellar physiology produce similar behavioral output, but provide distinct baselines for responses to mutations."

It also contributes to cognitive processes that do not relate to movement. Changes in the cerebellum are often seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorders, and many genes implicated in autism are active in the cerebellum. One of these genes encodes part of a receptor for the signaling molecule GABA, and is called <i>GABRB3</i> in humans. Each person usually inherits one copy of the <i>GABRB3</i> gene from each parent. However, if a mother does not pass on this gene, her child may develop Angelman syndrome. Those affected by this disorder show impaired movement and cognitive abilities, and often show signs of autism."

The experiments unexpectedly revealed that key brain cells in the cerebellum of male control mice were different from the same cells in female mice. The cells in males had lower baseline levels of electrical activity and responded differently to signals from other cells. The differences arose partly because a group of receptors \u2013 called metabotropic glutamate receptors \u2013 were more easily activated in the brain cells in females than in males. Nevertheless, both male mice and female mice did equally well at learning to balance on a rotating rod, which is a skill that is controlled by the cerebellum. In other words, the cerebellum works differently in male and female mice but produces the same output."

By contrast, female mutants did not improve during training on the same task. Measuring the activity of cells in the cerebellum showed that the metabotropic glutamate receptors in cells from mutant male mice had changed so that they responded more like those of females. However, the responses of mutant female mice did not change compared to control female mice. This result suggests that the changes in the brain cells of male mutant mice helped compensate for the <i>Gabrb3</i> mutation. It also shows that baseline differences in the brains of male and female animals can make them respond differently to mutations associated with genetic disorders."

They integrate synaptic inhibition from Purkinje neurons of the cerebellar cortex with synaptic excitation from mossy fibers and inferior olivary fibers, thereby generating the sole output of the non-vestibulocerebellum. Consequently, disruptions in intrinsic or synaptic signaling anywhere in the cerebellar circuit are likely to manifest themselves in CbN cell activity, either as altered or compensatory responses. Recent work has drawn attention to the fact that many genes disrupted in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are expressed in the cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fatemi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that, regardless of the etiology of the phenotypes associated with the condition, cerebellar processing may be affected. Indeed, cerebellar abnormalities are consistently found in post-mortem examinations of autistic brains, which reveal decreases in size and number of Purkinje and/or CbN cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bauman and Kemper, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arin et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bailey et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kemper and Bauman, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Whitney et al., 2008</a>). Mice with the 15q11-13 duplication, a model for one form of autism, show defects in cerebellar learning (<a href=\"#bib53\">Piochon et al., 2014</a>), and mutation of <i>Tsc1</i> in Purkinje cells alone can recapitulate several autism-like behaviors in mice (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tsai et al., 2012</a>). Studying the cerebellum in mouse models of autism may therefore yield insight into how cerebellar output is generated and to what extent cerebellar processing is plastic or disrupted in the face of genetic abnormalities."

It is among the genes affected in Angelman syndrome, a condition in which patients show developmental delay, motor stereotypy, and movement disorders, among other symptoms (<a href=\"#bib69\">Williams et al., 2006</a>). These patients have a microdeletion of the 15q11-13 region of the maternal chromosome, which spans multiple genes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Knoll et al., 1989</a>), of which <i>UBE3A</i> and <i>GABRB3</i> have been the most extensively studied. Mice lacking maternal <i>Ube3a</i> recapitulate many but not all phenotypes expected for an animal model of Angelman syndrome (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jiang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allensworth et al., 2011</a>). Mice lacking only the maternal copy of <i>Gabrb3</i> (m-/p+), however, also show many of these phenotypes. Regarding cerebellar function, adult <i>Gabrb3\u2009</i>m-/p+ mice display deficits in motor learning as measured by the accelerating rotarod task (<a href=\"#bib18\">DeLorey et al., 2011</a>). In the cerebellum, \u03b23 is expressed in Purkinje and granule cells, with low expression in the cerebellar nuclei (<a href=\"#bib45\">Laurie et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fritschy and Mohler, 1995</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib35\">H\u00f6rtnagl et al., 2013</a>). Since \u03b23 slows the kinetics of GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents in expression systems (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hinkle and Macdonald, 2003</a>), IPSC kinetics of neurons that express GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b23 are predicted to be accelerated in <i>Gabrb3</i>\u2009m-/p+ mice, which should disinhibit those cells and alter signaling through the cerebellum. Since all such changes must ultimately be funneled through the cerebellar nuclei, we examined synaptic properties of large, likely glutamatergic, premotor CbN neurons in cerebellar slices from wild-type and <i>Gabrb3</i>\u2009m-/p+ mice."

Males and females also respond differently to the <i>Gabrb3</i>\u2009m-/p+ mutation, which triggers an augmentation of mGluR1/5 responses and intrinsic firing rates in male but not female mutant mice, which is apparently compensatory on a motor learning task."

Male and female <i>Gabrb3\u2009</i>m-/p+ mice and littermate controls were considered separately because of sex differences reported in behavioral responses to the mutation (<a href=\"#bib18\">DeLorey et al., 2011</a>). Whole-cell recordings were made from large CbN cells in cerebellar slices from P17-P24 mice, and voltage-clamped synaptic currents were evoked with 100-Hz, 200-ms trains of electrical stimuli to evoke Purkinje cell-mediated IPSCs (<a href=\"#bib63\">Telgkamp and Raman, 2002</a>). Because these stimulus trains necessarily also elicit glutamate release from excitatory mossy fibers, AMPA and NMDA receptors were blocked by 5 \u00b5M DNQX and 10 \u00b5M CPP. The trains evoked outward synaptic currents dominated by GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated current from Purkinje cell stimulation (<a href=\"#bib63\">Telgkamp and Raman, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). During trains, the synaptic current did not decay fully, so that with the onset of the next stimulus, the additional 'phasic' current, i.e., synaptic current evoked by release elicited by a single stimulation, summed with the preceding 'tonic' current, i.e., residual or accumulating synaptic current from previous release events. The tonic component is of interest because it is largely responsible for suppressing intrinsic firing by CbN cells (<a href=\"#bib63\">Telgkamp and Raman, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Person and Raman, 2012</a>). In wild-type males and females, the phasic components largely overlaid one another (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>; repeated-measures ANOVA p<i>=0.78</i>). In contrast, the synaptic current decayed to a greater extent in females, leading to a tonic component that was more than 3-fold larger in wild-type males than females (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, +/+ males n=11, +/+ females n=10, p<i>=0.005</i>). This result was replicated in C57BL/6 males and females (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), demonstrating that elements of basal synaptic transmission in the CbN of mice differ between the sexes, even in pre-pubertal animals."

These data corroborate previous results from immunostaining and in situ\u00a0hybridization that report cerebellar GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b23 expression to be primarily in granule cells and Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Laurie et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fritschy and Mohler, 1995</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib35\">H\u00f6rtnagl et al., 2013</a>).

Consistent with a gene dosage effect, loss of the maternal <i>Gabrb3</i> allele significantly reduced GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b23 expression to about half in both sexes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, males, n=3, p<i>=0.001</i>; females, n=3, p<i>=0.005</i>).

To test the extent to which IPSC decay times were predictive of tonic currents, we calculated the expected tonic current based on IPSC decay times and compared it to the measured tonic current. The decay time constants, however, lengthened during the train, such that the last IPSC was significantly longer than the first for wild-type males (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, open symbols; weighted \u03c4<sub>decay</sub> for last IPSC, +/+ males, 4.4 \u00b1 0.7 ms, n=10, p<i>=0.013 vs.</i> 1<sup>st</sup> IPSC; m-/p+ males, 3.2 \u00b1 0.8 ms, n=11, p<i>=0.36</i>; +/+ females, 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 ms, n=10, p<i>=0.21</i>; m-/p+ females, 3.1 \u00b1 0.8 ms, n=11, p<i>=0.17</i>). Although the basis for this change is unknown, it is consistent with a decreasing synchrony of neurotransmitter release time as the train progresses, e.g., associated with changing action potential waveforms (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bischofberger et al., 2002</a>). We therefore incorporated this gradual change in \u03c4<sub>decay</sub> into our calculations (<i>Materials and Methods</i>) and estimated the tonic current for each group. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, for wild-type males, the predicted and measured currents were closely matched (<i>solid and open black triangles</i>), indicating that IPSC kinetics are sufficient to account for the tonic synaptic current. For mutant males and both female groups, however, the IPSC decay times consistently predicted a tonic current that is smaller than in wild-type males but still <i>larger</i> than the measured values (<i>open vs. solid symbols</i>), suggesting an additional factor either reducing the total outward tonic current or contributing a tonic inward current."

We therefore tested the effect of CPCCOEt (100 \u00b5M), which effectively blocks group I mGluRs in CbN cells in a manner that is mimicked by a combination of the selective mGluR1 antagonist JNJ16259685 and mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zheng and Raman, 2011</a>).

After a recording was established, the excitatory amino acid transporter blocker <span class=\"small-caps\">dl</span>-TBOA (50 \u00b5M) was added to the bath. TBOA increases glutamate spillover (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brasnjo and Otis, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Huang et al., 2004</a>) and augments the evoked responses of group I mGluRs in the CbN of ~2-week-old rats (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zhang and Linden, 2006</a>). In the present experiments, however, application of TBOA had a striking effect even in the absence of synaptic stimulation: it evoked a large standing current of a few hundred pA at -40 mV, which was largely reversed by group I mGluR antagonists. The remaining current was not further altered by a return to control solutions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Consistent with an action at mGluR1/5, the magnitude of the effect of CPCCOEt (n=10) was indistinguishable from that of combined JNJ16259685 (0.2 \u00b5M) and MPEP (40 \u00b5M, n=29, p<i>=0.63</i>) and the data were pooled. To test whether the effect of TBOA resulted from glutamate released in an action-potential-dependent manner, 1 \u00b5M TTX was added to the bath in a subset of experiments. The TBOA-induced current was indeed reversed by TTX (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, C57BL/6 male mice; control -305 \u00b1 99\u2009pA; TBOA -570 \u00b1 139\u2009pA, <i>p=0.033 vs.</i> control; TBOA+TTX -338 \u00b1 43\u2009pA, p<i>=0.2 vs.</i> control), and the variance of the standing current was reduced. The data are consistent with the idea that spontaneously firing nearby cells continuously release glutamate. In the presence of TBOA, the released glutamate reaches and activates group I mGluRs on CbN cells, which in turn couple to other channels; at this voltage, the inward current is likely carried primarily through L-type Ca channels (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zheng and Raman, 2011</a>)."

The ramp revealed a standing inward current that increased in amplitude until about -35 mV, decreased from -35 mV to -50 mV, and then increased monotonically until the end of the ramp (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This current profile reflects what has previously been identified as an L-type voltage gated Ca current (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zheng and Raman, 2011</a>) and a cationic leak current (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zhang and Linden, 2006</a>; see also <a href=\"#bib56\">Raman et al., 2000</a>). Both currents are active during the initial depolarization, and both increase in amplitude as the voltage is ramped down and the driving force increases. With further hyperpolarization, however, the L-type current deactivates, decreasing the current amplitude, until only the leak current remains. Application of TBOA increases the current amplitude between -80 and -35 mV in all four groups, consistent with both currents being potentiated by mGluR1/5 activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The magnitude of the current increase varied widely across cells, and differences were not statistically significant despite different mean values (repeated-measures ANOVA p<i>=0.66</i>, males n=10, females n=8).

This observation lends support to the idea that the lack of detectable evoked mGluR1/5-dependent current in wild-type males depends on intact glutamate transport.

We therefore measured spontaneous firing rates in CbN cells, with fast excitatory transmission blocked by 5 \u00b5M DNQX and 10\u00a0\u00b5M CPP. Indeed, CbN cells fired more slowly in wild-type males (65 \u00b1 7 spikes/s, n=14) than in females (98 \u00b1 9 spikes/s, n=16; p<i>=0.02</i>), again reflecting a sex difference in basic CbN cell properties (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). CbN cells from mutant males tended to fire somewhat faster than from wild-type males (92 \u00b1 9 spikes/s, n=11, p<i>=0.08</i>), whereas cells from mutant females had the same firing rates as those from wild-type females (96 \u00b1 10 spikes/s, n=20, p<i>=0.9</i>).

Thus, the sex differences in basal cerebellar physiology and in response to the <i>Gabrb3</i>\u2009m-/p+ mutation may extend beyond synaptic activation of mGluRs. These differences in CbN cell spontaneous rates mirror the differences in synaptic responses, raising the possibility that chronic activation of group I mGluRs may contribute a depolarizing current that affects firing. The experiments of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, however, demonstrated that holding currents at -40 mV were not different across the four groups of mice (+/+ males -565 \u00b1 40\u2009pA; m-/p+ males -491 \u00b1 59\u2009pA; +/+ females -406 \u00b1 83\u2009pA; m-/p+ females -424 \u00b1 49\u2009pA, p<i>=0.26</i>).

If the increase in train-evoked mGluR1/5-dependent current observed in neurons from male mutants and all female mice leads to a greater potentiation of L-type currents, the extent of CPCCOEt-sensitive prolonged rebound firing should be greater in neurons from these animals than from wild-type male mice."

In CPP and DNQX, CbN cells were current-clamped and enough hyperpolarizing holding current was applied to reduce regular intrinsic firing to a frequency near 40\u2009Hz. When 100-Hz, 500-ms stimulus trains were applied, firing either slowed or ceased, consistent with the outward currents seen in voltage clamp. In all cells, firing rates for the 300 ms just after the stimulus were faster than firing rates during the 500 ms just before the stimulus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). To quantify these changes and account for small differences in the pre-stimulus baseline firing rates across cells, we calculated the percent change in rate from the ratio of the post-stimulus to the pre-stimulus rate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Consistent with an upregulation of mGluR1/5 responses, the firing rate acceleration in CbN cells was greater in m-/p+ than wild-type males. Moreover, in the same cells, this difference disappeared when group I mGluRs were blocked. In females, cells from both wild-type and mutant mice showed prolonged rebound firing that was reduced on average by CPCCOEt."

In contrast, in CbN cells from wild-type males, only 7 \u00b1 14% of the firing rate increase after inhibition can be attributed to group I mGluRs, while for cells from m-/p+ males, 53 \u00b1 13% is CPCCOEt-dependent (p<i>=0.03</i>). This small effect of CPCCOEt on prolonged rebound firing in wild-type males correlates with the low magnitude of evoked mGluR1/5-dependent current in these animals. The larger CPCCOEt effect in mutant males is consistent with the idea that the upregulation of the mGluR1/5 response indeed generates a larger potentiation of L-type currents. In females, a CPCCOEt effect was evident in both wild-type and mutant mice, consistent with the voltage-clamp measurements, but responses were generally more variable than in males, suggesting that factors in addition to mGluR1/5 activation may affect prolonged rebound firing in females."

These results support the hypothesis that the upregulation of evoked mGluR1/5-dependent current in CbN cells of mutant males arises indirectly from the reduced GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b23 subunit in the cerebellar cortex, and strongly suggest that this upregulation serves a compensatory role in cerebellar motor learning tasks."

The response to an autism-linked mutation likewise differs between the sexes. With the <i>Gabrb3</i>\u2009m-/p+ mutation, which is predicted to increase inhibitory drive from Purkinje cells, CbN neurons in male mice upregulate their mGluR1/5 responses to synaptic stimulation, whereas females do not. This change in the mGluR1/5 response appears to be a direct response to changes in Purkinje cell input, since restricting the m-/p+ mutation to Purkinje cells is sufficient to elicit it, and it also appears compensatory, since mutant male mice perform indistinguishably from wild-type males in a motor learning task that involves the cerebellum. In contrast, mutant females, which do not upregulate their mGluR1/5 responses, perform differently from wild-type females. Thus, sex differences in electrophysiological properties are present in a brain region in which such differences have not been extensively investigated. The sex-specific synaptic physiology in turn provides distinct backgrounds on which responses to genetic alterations occur."

Such indirect effects of reduced GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b23 expression could be an exacerbation of or a compensation for disrupted synaptic physiology elsewhere in the circuit. Since the GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b23 subunit is expected to prolong IPSCs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hinkle and Macdonald, 2003</a>) in cells that express it, i.e., Purkinje and cerebellar granule cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Laurie et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fritschy and Mohler, 1995</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib35\">H\u00f6rtnagl et al., 2013</a>), reduced GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b23 expression in m-/p+ mice is predicted to disinhibit granule and Purkinje cells during behaviors that normally engage cerebellar cortical interneurons. The simplest mode of counterbalancing the resulting elevation of inhibition to CbN cells would be by increasing the net excitatory drive and/or raising intrinsic excitability. Indeed, evidence for both changes were observed in male m-/p+ mice. The larger mGluR1/5-dependent currents evoked by stimulation of excitatory afferents serve to counteract much of the tonic outward current elicited by concurrent stimulation of inhibitory afferents, and the increased activation of group I mGluRs is sufficient to raise excitability, as evident by the facilitation of prolonged rebound firing relative to wild-type cells. In addition, the increase in spontaneous firing rates in mutant males, which occurs without a measurable increase in holding current when cells are voltage-clamped, suggests that one or more intrinsic ion channels may also be modulated by the mutation. Independently of mechanism, the observed increase in mGluR1/5-dependent current and intrinsic excitability in male <i>Gabrb3</i>\u2009m-/p+ CbN cells is well suited to compensate for the predicted increase in inhibitory drive (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, <i>top</i>).

For example, in the <i>pcd</i> and <i>lurcher</i> mutations, loss of inhibitory input to CbN neurons from degeneration of Purkinje cells triggers structural and physiological changes that increase the efficacy of the residual inhibition (<a href=\"#bib29\">Garin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sultan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Linneman et al., 2004</a>).

Specifically, males and females have (1) different magnitudes of evoked mGluR1/5-dependent currents, possibly owing to differential access of glutamate to receptors, (2) different IPSC decay kinetics, and (3) different spontaneous firing rates. Although the etiology of these differences has yet to be fully examined, they seem likely to arise from a sex difference in neuronal properties rather than from modulation by circulating gonadal hormones, since they are present in pre-pubertal mice. This idea is compatible with other reports of sexually dimorphic molecular and cell biological attributes of cerebellar neurons in juvenile rodents (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dean and McCarthy, 2008</a>). For instance, calbindin expression in Purkinje neurons is higher in weanling females than males; this difference is determined by sex chromosome complement, regardless of gonadal sex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abel et al., 2011</a>). Another example of pre-pubertal cerebellar sex differences comes from rat pups, in which the inflammation-associated prostaglandin PGE2 can activate aromatase, and the resulting estradiol synthesis within the cerebellum leads to reduced Purkinje cell dendritic arborization (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sakamoto et al., 2001</a>). A decrease in Purkinje cell capacitance, as a proxy for arborization, can be mimicked by exogenous estradiol in males but not females, even in juvenile rodent brains (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dean et al., 2012</a>). Precedent also exists for the idea that genetic mutations in the cerebellum are differentially manifested between the sexes; the <i>reeler</i> and <i>staggerer</i> mutations, which both lead to Purkinje cell degeneration, have earlier and/or more extreme effects in heterozygous males than females, with differences evident in animals as young as one month old (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hadj-Sahraoui et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Doulazmi et al., 1999</a>)."

In the present study, the relative amplitudes of inward and outward synaptic currents reported are specific to the experimental conditions. In vivo, processed sensory signals from mossy fibers are expected to excite CbN cells and activate the granule cell-Purkinje cell pathway that concurrently releases GABA onto the same CbN neurons. Thus, the amplitude of mGluR1/5-dependent currents relative to IPSCs is likely to regulate CbN cell firing in vivo. Moreover, the role of group I mGluRs in the cerebellum may differ between the sexes, as has been shown in other brain regions (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boulware et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tabatadze et al., 2015</a>)."

For current clamp recordings, where indicated, steady hyperpolarizing current was applied to maintain baseline firing at a desired rate. Voltages are not corrected for a measured junction potential of 10 mV. For pharmacological studies, recordings were made 5\u201310 min after perfusion of a drug was initiated to ensure complete equilibration. For experiments in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, cells were switched to current clamp during drug perfusions and allowed to fire action potentials, which prevented both the treatment-independent increase of leak current and the rundown of L-type Ca current during the experiment. For four months during the course of the experiments, construction near the animal facility produced extreme vibrations (&gt;5000 \u00b5inches/s) that correlated with changes in wild-type synaptic physiology in wild-type males (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), much as the m-/p+ mutation did, indicating that cerebellar synaptic properties can be sensitive to environmental stimuli.

Cerebellar nuclei (7 slices per mouse) and cortex (11 slices per mouse) were separated and placed in ice cold HEPES homogenizing buffer containing (mM): 5 HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 320 sucrose, 5 EDTA, 1 Na orthovanadate, 50 NaF, 10 Na pyrophosphate, 20 Na glycerophosphate, 0.1 phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride, plus protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK).

Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford protein assay. Equal amounts of protein were separated on 7\u201310% SDS-PAGE gels and Western blotting was carried out as in <a href=\"#bib60\">Tabatadze et al. (2013)</a>. Briefly, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and then incubated with one of the following primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C: mouse monoclonal anti-mGluR1 (1:1000, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), rabbit-polyclonal anti-mGluR5 (1:1000, EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), rabbit-polyclonal anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b23 (1:1000, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and goat polyclonal anti-\u03b2-actin (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX).

Immunoreactivity was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL Plus, Thermo scientific, Rockford, IL) and analyzed with Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD). After visualization of mGluRs and GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b23, blots were stripped and probed for \u03b2-actin as a loading control. For each group, protein levels were expressed relative to \u03b2-actin in the same sample. To compare results across blots, the protein ratio for each band was normalized to the sum of the protein ratios for all samples on the blot, divided by the total number of lanes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Degasperi et al., 2014</a>). Three independent experiments were run with tissue from <i>Gabrb3</i> mice (biological replicates), each with one +/+ male, one m-/p+ male, one +/+ female, and one m-/p+ female sample, and each sample was run in duplicate. Three independent experiments were run with tissue from C57BL/6 mice, each with two male and two female samples (biological replicates) to total 6 samples per sex, and each sample was run in duplicate. For comparison of cortex vs. nuclei in C57BL/6 mice, two independent samples were run for each sex and region, with no duplicates."

Mice were placed on the rod and allowed to acclimate for at least 30 s before the rod was accelerated at varying speeds as noted. Latency to fall was measured automatically, but was also monitored by the experimentalist. If mice grasped the rod and rotated completely, latency to fall was counted when the mouse completed its rotation. After one trial, mice were allowed to remain in the chamber for at least 5 min, followed by another trial. The two trials were averaged for each day, and this process was repeated for a total of seven days."

Moreover, the electrophysiology, done in 32 cells, illustrates that the same changes in tonic current in CbN cells are seen with the Purkinje-specific mutation, and support the idea that the changes seen in mutant male mice are compensatory, in a manner that would offset the expected increase in inhibition to CbN cells owing to the mutation.
