                    "text": "The histone variant H2A.Z is a universal mark of gene promoters, enhancers, and regulatory elements in eukaryotic chromatin. The chromatin remodeler SWR1 mediates site-specific incorporation of H2A.Z by a multi-step histone replacement reaction, evicting histone H2A-H2B from the canonical nucleosome and depositing the H2A.Z-H2B dimer. Binding of both substrates, the canonical nucleosome and the H2A.Z-H2B dimer, is essential for activation of SWR1. We found that SWR1 primarily recognizes key residues within the \u03b12 helix in the histone-fold of nucleosomal histone H2A, a region not previously known to influence remodeler activity. Moreover, SWR1 interacts preferentially with nucleosomal DNA at superhelix location 2 on the nucleosome face distal to its linker-binding site. Our findings provide new molecular insights on recognition of the canonical nucleosome by a chromatin remodeler and have implications for ATP-driven mechanisms of histone eviction and deposition."

The chromatin remodeler SWR1 mediates site-specific incorporation of H2A.Z by a multi-step histone replacement reaction, evicting histone H2A-H2B from the canonical nucleosome and depositing the H2A.Z-H2B dimer. Binding of both substrates, the canonical nucleosome and the H2A.Z-H2B dimer, is essential for activation of SWR1. We found that SWR1 primarily recognizes key residues within the \u03b12 helix in the histone-fold of nucleosomal histone H2A, a region not previously known to influence remodeler activity. Moreover, SWR1 interacts preferentially with nucleosomal DNA at superhelix location 2 on the nucleosome face distal to its linker-binding site. Our findings provide new molecular insights on recognition of the canonical nucleosome by a chromatin remodeler and have implications for ATP-driven mechanisms of histone eviction and deposition."

Complexes of proteins, such as SWR1, alter the packing of chromatin and are known as \u2018chromatin modifiers\u2019. To express a gene, parts of the chromatin have to unpack to allow various proteins and other factors to access to the underlying DNA. Chromatin remodeling enzymes can loosen chromatin by sliding nucleosomes away from each other, removing them altogether, or replacing one type of histone with another. For example, a histone variant called H2A.Z appears to poise genes for expression and is enriched near the start sites of most genes in the genome. The SWR1 complex evicts the conventional, \u2018canonical histone\u2019 called H2A that is already present at these sites and replaces them with H2A.Z."

The experiments revealed that the SWR1 complex recognizes key elements within the histone H2A protein itself that differ from H2A.Z. Binding to H2A activates SWR1 and causes it to replace H2A with H2A.Z."

The experiments revealed that gaps in DNA at a specific region of the nucleosome prevent SWR1 from depositing H2A.Z. Therefore, close contact between SWR1 and a nucleosome's DNA is another factor that is required for SWR1 activity. These findings provide new insights as to how SWR1 recognizes histone and DNA elements of a canonical nucleosome. Further work is needed to understand how SWR1 acts to replace H2A with H2A.Z."

In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, H2A.Z is deposited by the ATP-dependent activity of the multi-component SWI/SNF-related SWR1 complex, which replaces nucleosomal histone H2A-H2B with H2A.Z-H2B in a coupled histone-dimer transfer (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mizuguchi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Luk et al., 2010</a>). SWR1 recruitment to nucleosome-deficient or nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) of yeast promoters is due to its preference for nucleosomes adjoining long linker DNA (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ranjan et al., 2013</a>), but post-recruitment activation of the SWR1 complex requires binding of both its natural substrates\u2014the canonical nucleosome and the H2A.Z-H2B dimer\u2014which also serve as essential activators of SWR1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Luk et al., 2010</a>). Progression of the SWR1-mediated reaction on the canonical \u2018AA\u2019 nucleosome generates the \u2018AZ\u2019 and \u2018ZZ\u2019 nucleosome states consecutively, which leads to repression of the ATPase and histone exchange activities of SWR1 by the H2A.Z-nucleosome end-product, thereby preventing futile expenditure of chemical energy (<a href=\"#bib17\">Luk et al., 2010</a>). Specific \u03b1-C helix residues of H2A.Z on the free H2A.Z-H2B dimer are critical for its SWR1-activating function (<a href=\"#bib7\">Clarkson et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Wu et al., 2005</a>). However, the key-activating elements of the canonical nucleosome that distinguish it from the non-activating H2A.Z-nucleosome have been obscure. Here, we show that the histone-fold, but not the \u03b1-C helix of histone H2A in the nucleosome, has a major role in the activation of the SWR1 complex. We also define a local DNA site on the nucleosome core particle that is critical for activating SWR1."

Hybrid nucleosome substrates were reconstituted and analyzed by a SWR1-mediated histone H2A.Z replacement assay. Interchanging the M6 and \u03b1-C regions of H2A with H2A.Z on the nucleosome had only a small effect on SWR1 activity as measured by nucleosomal incorporation of H2A.Z-3xFlag, which generates a native gel mobility upshift (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Strikingly, an additional interchange of the M4 domain of nucleosomal H2A with H2A.Z caused a \u223c90% decrease in H2A.Z replacement by SWR1, and extension of the interchange to M2 and M3 domains further reduced SWR1's activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Interchanging the M4 domain alone caused a large reduction in activity of SWR1, and activity was also reduced by interchange of M5 and M3A domains individually, whereas M2 and M3B domain interchanges had minimal effects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Thus, residues contained entirely within the H2A histone-fold motif (the \u03b11 helix, \u03b12 helix, and loop 2) contribute to activation of SWR1. Underlying mechanism(s) could include improved enzyme binding, as the non-activating H2A.Z-nucleosome shows slightly decreased affinity for SWR1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), but activation at a post-recruitment step is required, because neither ATPase stimulation nor histone replacement occurs under saturating conditions ([<a href=\"#bib17\">Luk et al., 2010</a>] and data not shown). Interchange of the M4 region of H2A for H2A.Z (substitution of five residues) in yeast causes lethality (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). This indicates that the N-terminal portion of the H2A \u03b12 helix provides an essential function apart from regulating SWR1 activity, which itself is not essential for viability. Glycine 47 is the only surface accessible H2A-specific residue in the M4 region. Strains bearing single or double amino acid substitutions to corresponding H2A.Z residues-G47K and P49A are viable. The single P49A substitution showed no reduction (even an increase) of H2A.Z levels at gene promoters by ChIP-PCR. However, the G47K interchange in the M4 region shows reduced H2A.Z incorporation (average 63% of WT), as does the double-substitution G47K, P49A (average 54% of WT), suggesting that G47 facilitates activation of SWR1 in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

In vitro, SWR1 is known to bind preferentially to long linker DNA adjacent to a nucleosome core particle (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ranjan et al., 2013</a>). To favor SWR1 binding in one orientation, we reconstituted mono-nucleosomes bearing only one 60 bp linker and subjected bound nucleosomes to hydroxyl radical footprinting (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Notably, we observed protection at superhelix locations (SHLs) SHL0, SHL+1, and SHL+2 on the linker-distal side of the nucleosome dyad (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Systematic introduction of two-nucleotide gaps on one DNA strand of a nucleosome showed that a single gap at \u221217, \u221218 nt from the nucleosome dyad blocked the second round of H2A.Z replacement (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Further scanning identified a 6 nt region (\u221217 to \u221222 nt from the dyad), whose integrity is required for histone replacement (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This gap-sensitive region overlaps with the hydroxyl radical footprint of linker-oriented SWR1 at nucleosome position SHL2. Introduction of gaps on both sides of the nucleosome dyad caused a complete failure of H2A.Z replacement by SWR1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Taken together, our findings indicate that close contact between SWR1 and nucleosomal DNA around SHL2 is critical for enzyme activation. This activation likely occurs post-recruitment, as SWR1 binding is not adversely affected on the gap-containing nucleosome substrate (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

SWR1 quantitatively evicts both H2A-H2B dimers on this nucleosome, replacing them with H2A.Z-H2B, but whether nucleosome positioning was also altered was unknown. To examine this question, we used a 601 nucleosome bearing a 60 bp linker on one side, and a native PAGE mobility assay, which separates nucleosomes on the basis of different linker lengths and spatial orientation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hamiche et al., 1999</a>). We found no substantial mobility shift indicative of a repositioned nucleosome after incorporation of (untagged) H2A.Z-H2B (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Similar results were obtained for a center-positioned 601 nucleosome (data not shown). By contrast, the INO80 remodeler mobilized the nucleosome from the end- to center-position, as shown by gel mobility shift (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Shen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Udugama et al., 2011</a>).

A DNA site at SHL2 on the nucleosome, in a region identified for DNA translocation by chromatin remodelers RSC, SWI/SNF, ISW2, and ISW1, is also important for histone exchange by SWR1. The ATPase domains of the SNF2 and ISW2 nucleosome sliding complexes are known to interact with the nucleosome at SHL2 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dang and Bartholomew, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dechassa et al., 2012</a>), and we envision that the catalytic Swr1 ATPase also contacts the SHL2 site. Footprinting experiments show that other chromatin remodelers contact the nucleosome core particle at either the linker-proximal side or both sides of the dyad axis; however, SWR1 contacts the core particle on the linker-distal side of the dyad. This distinction between SWR1 and other remodelers may reflect the unique requirements of dimer eviction and deposition as opposed to nucleosome sliding. Within the nucleosome core particle, each H2A-H2B dimer is stabilized by histone\u2013DNA interactions (at three minor groove locations SHL3.5, SHL4.5, and SHL5.5) and histone\u2013histone interactions (the \u03b12 and \u03b13 helices of H2B interact with \u03b12 and \u03b13 helices of H4 in a four-helix bundle). For histone exchange, SWR1 must disrupt either one or both of these interactions, coordinated with H2A.Z-H2B deposition. This might be initiated by transient, confined DNA translocation by the SWR1 ATPase essentially as indicated for other remodelers (<a href=\"#bib6\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</a>), but without propagation as histone exchange is not accompanied by repositioning of the histone octamer on DNA. Alternatively, histone replacement could be initiated by a local, ATP-driven DNA conformational change near SHL2 that alters the path of the DNA superhelix, resulting in destabilization of H2A-H2B contacts with DNA or with the H3-H4 tetramer (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

This C-terminal region is important for binding of the free H2A.Z-H2B dimer to specific chaperones (<a href=\"#bib18\">Luk et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hong et al., 2014</a>), and for effector interactions post-incorporation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Clarkson et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adam et al., 2001</a>). For histone H2A.Z replacement, our analysis shows that SWR1 utilizes other unique and conserved features of the H2A nucleosome for substrate specificity. Of the three SWR1-activating regions of the H2A histone-fold, the \u03b12 helix and loop 2 are exposed on the nucleosome surface for contact with SWR1, whereas the \u03b11 helix is buried and may act by allostery (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Residue G47 of the H2A \u03b12 helix is highly conserved and is located at the bottom of a cleft (\u223c8 \u00c5 deep) on the H2A nucleosome surface (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). This cleft might serve as a structural feature for recognition by SWR1; the presence of a Lysine residue at this position in H2A.Z would fill it (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). It would be of interest to determine structural interactions of SWR1 with this local nucleosome surface. Our findings provide new insights on the structural basis by which canonical and H2A.Z-nucleosomes are recognized by SWR1 and should facilitate future studies of the histone H2A.Z replacement mechanism."

They constructed hybrids in which H2A segments were systematically interchanged with segments of histone H2A.Z. Hybrid nucleosome substrates were then reconstituted and analyzed by a SWR1-mediated histone H2A.Z replacement assay. The authors were able to show that the nucleosomal H2A \u03b1-2 helix, but not the \u03b1-C helix, plays a major role in the activation of the SWR1 complex. They also identified a local DNA site on the nucleosome core particle (around SHL2) that is critical for activating SWR1. Overall, the work is well designed, well executed, and well presented. The manuscript is clearly and concisely written. Notably, the extensive work involving DNA gaps near SHL2 shows that the reaction progresses from AA to AZ when a gap is located on one side, but is prevented (remains AA) when gaps reside on both sides (in the 17-22 region). These experiments are convincing and really inform the mechanism. Also, the apparent lack of nucleosome sliding provides an interesting contrast to other remodelers."

First, we interchanged the M4 region of H2A for H2A.Z (substitution of 5 residues) and examined the mutant phenotype in yeast. We found that the M4 swap causes lethality in yeast cells, indicating that the N-terminal portion of the H2A \u03b12 helix provides an essential function apart from regulating SWR1 activity, which is not essential for cell viability. The single P49A substitution is viable, and shows no reduction (even an increase) of H2A.Z levels on a sample of yeast gene promoters by ChIP-PCR. However, the G47K interchange of the only surface-accessible residue in the M4 region shows reduced H2A.Z incorporation, as does the double-substitution G47K, P49A. Thus, our in vivo findings are consistent with, and support the importance of the M4 region of H2A in activating SWR1 in vitro. We have included a new supplemental figure, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2</a>, and discussed the data in the revised text (Results, first paragraph)."
