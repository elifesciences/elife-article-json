Consequently, alternative expressions of associative learning are rarely considered. Here we identify a novel, active fear response (\u2018darting\u2019) that occurs primarily in female rats. In females, darting exhibits the characteristics of a learned fear behavior, appearing during the CS period as conditioning proceeds and disappearing from the CS period during extinction. This finding motivates a reinterpretation of rodent fear conditioning studies, particularly in females, and it suggests that conditioned fear behavior is more diverse than previously appreciated. Moreover, rats that darted during initial fear conditioning exhibited lower freezing during the second day of extinction testing, suggesting that females employ distinct and adaptive fear response strategies that improve long-term outcomes."

The experiments used a technique called cued fear conditioning, which pairs a sound with a mild electrical shock to a foot. When rats learn that the sound predicts the shock, the sound alone causes them to produce a fear response. However, if the sound is then played repeatedly without a footshock, the rats learn to become less fearful of the sound in another learning process called \u201cextinction\u201d."

Animals that displayed darting were also less likely to freeze in response to the sound cue, which suggests that darting may represent an alternative fear strategy that is more common in females. During a subsequent extinction test, females that darted also displayed quicker reductions in both types of fear responses, which suggests that darting might be an active coping response that promotes long term reductions in fear."

In these assays, the strength of a tone-shock association is traditionally measured by the fraction of time during the conditioned stimulus (CS) that subjects exhibit freezing, defined as the cessation of all movement not required for respiration (<a href=\"#bib4\">Fanselow, 1980</a>). Accordingly, low freezing is generally interpreted as reflecting a weak association and thus poor learning. Likewise, low freezing after extinction is taken to indicate successful suppression of the conditioned response, a new memory (<a href=\"#bib20\">Quirk and Mueller, 2008</a>). However, by their construction, these traditional assays are insensitive to alternative expressions of fear, such as escape."

Whether this effect reflects genuine learning deficits in females, or is related to sex differences in fear response strategies is unknown. For example, females reliably exhibit heightened ambulation in a wide variety of common behavioral tests (<a href=\"#bib1\">Archer, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Fernandes et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">File, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Seney et al., 2012</a>), which may influence their selection of responses to threatening stimuli."

We quantified these responses by identifying and counting them as discrete events in traces of each animal\u2019s velocity for all sessions using Noldus Ethovision software and custom Matlab code (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">source code 1</a>, Materials and methods, and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). We calculated darting rate (darts/min) during four non-overlapping trial epochs: 1) 60\u2009s pre-CS period, 2) 30\u2009s CS presentation, 3) 5\u2009s \u201cshock response\u201d period, and 4) 30\u2009s post-shock period (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>).

First, CS dart rate in darting males was characterized by a steady low rate of darting across trials (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3i</a>), instead of the increase across trials observed in females (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>), suggesting that darting in males may not reflect a learned fear response, but general hyperactivity that results in less freezing. Second, unlike our observations in females, male Darters did not exhibit heightened shock response velocities (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a>) or robust post-shock dart rates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3h</a>; p=0.01 2-way ANOVA group x trial interaction, F<sub>6,324</sub>=2.8, no main effects) compared to Non-darters. Third, male Darters did not exhibit lower freezing during extinction testing, suggesting that the potential long-term behavioral implications of darting during fear conditioning are stronger in females than in males. Together with the large observed sex difference in darting prevalence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,f</a>), these discrepancies suggest that there may be qualitative differences in the potential causes and effects of darting in males versus females. Further work will be necessary to determine whether the neurobiological basis of darting is comparable in males and females."

To our knowledge, this is the first formal characterization of conditioned escape-like responses during classical fear conditioning, in which the shock cannot be avoided. In contrast, learned escape behavior has been well studied in Active Avoidance (AA) paradigms (<a href=\"#bib7\">Galatzer-Levy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Martinez et al., 2013</a>), and although research into potential sex differences in AA is rare, females are reported to learn AA faster than males (<a href=\"#bib3\">Dalla and Shors, 2009</a>), which is consistent with females preferring active fear responses over freezing."

                        "text": "One potentially provocative finding here is that female Darters exhibited comparable freezing to Non-darters at the start of extinction, but enhanced extinction retention the following day. Importantly, lower freezing during extinction retention could not be explained by increased darting during this phase. This suggests that darting during fear conditioning does not interfere with the formation or memory of the tone-shock association, but may confer a long-term protective or adaptive state that promotes increased cognitive flexibility and thus enhanced extinction maintenance (<a href=\"#bib16\">Maren et al., 2013</a>). This effect is reminiscent of reports from Maier and colleagues, who have convincingly demonstrated that perceived \u201cescapability\u201d in a shock stress paradigm leads to enhanced AA in subsequent testing (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib13\">Maier, 2015</a>). In a similar vein, increases in \u201cactive coping\u201d behavior (digging, rearing, wall-sniffing) during a cued fear memory test are positively correlated with AA success (<a href=\"#bib18\">Metna-Laurent et al., 2012</a>). Recruitment of these active coping fear responses instead of freezing has been shown to involve neural transmission in the central amygdala (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gozzi et al., 2010</a>) and depend on cannabinoid signaling (<a href=\"#bib18\">Metna-Laurent et al., 2012</a>), but to date have not been studied in female rodents. Importantly, these responses have not been demonstrated during fear conditioning learning, the stage at which darting appears to be most critical. Clearly, a great deal of work remains to dissect the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate darting, and to determine its relevance to other indices of active coping, especially in female model organisms."

Specifically, female rats that exhibit low freezing levels during fear conditioning could be erroneously described as expressing low fear and/or poor learning, when in fact they have engaged darting responses. This phenomenon may also be clinically relevant, pointing to a sex-specific threat response that predicts enhanced extinction maintenance. Because the learning processes that underlie extinction form the basis for exposure therapy (a common treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD]), a better understanding of the mechanisms that drive darting could lead to improved exposure therapy success. Women are at a twofold risk for PTSD compared to men, and thus identification of the neurobiological factors that determine darting in females may provide insight into sex differences in coping strategies, as well as in stress susceptibility and resilience."

(2010) and Laurent and colleagues (2012) demonstrate that conditioned freezing behaviors are inhibited to favor active coping strategies in classical fear conditioning paradigms. Thus, the temporal decrease in freezing behaviors observed in both male and female rats during extinction should be accompanied by an increase in active coping behaviors in these experimental animals. Did the authors not observe any switch from passive to active behaviors, and vice versa, in these experimental animals? Were other active coping strategies not present in male mice that were distinct from the darting phenotype present in female rats? Did female mice not exhibit other forms of active coping strategies other than darting? Alternatively, if the authors are arguing that their observed \"darting\" is different form of fear behavior than that of active or passive, it would serve the authors well to reconcile these claims with the current literature. In sum, please place the present results into the context of active vs passive coping strategies, adaptive strategies, and why those may differ between males and females."

We have crisply defined the first two entities, however it was not our goal to delineate true darting. We completely agree with the reviewer that this is a very interesting question, but we simply note in the Discussion that there are crucial features to the darting exhibited by females that are not seen in males. The implication is that male darting, as observed in this study, is qualitatively different from female darting, however we did not attempt to define or segregate true darters."

Animals that darted in response to shock or during inter-trial intervals but not during the CS were not considered Darters.

Although latent inhibition can be induced by prior exposure to a CS, we do not feel that it is a significant risk with our particular preparation. To date, latent inhibition in fear conditioned rats has only been demonstrated when CS pre-exposure is considerable and CS-US pairings brief, e.g. a pre-exposure of 20 or 30 tone presentations prior to a single CS-US presentation (De la Casa, 2013; Rudy, 1994), when tone pre-exposure is protracted in duration (Baker et al., 2012), or when it occurs over several sessions (Sotty et al., 1996). In other words, it appears that in order for latent inhibition to occur in cued fear conditioning, CS pre-exposure must be far more robust than 5 30-sec CSs, especially given the fairly high number of CS-US pairings (<a href=\"#bib7\">7</a>) in our preparation. Importantly, we have used this design in three recent publications (Gruene et al., 2014, 2015; Rey et al., 2014) and reliably observe rapid increases in freezing to CS during fear conditioning learning and testing, suggesting that latent inhibition plays a minimal, if any, role in our behavioral outcomes."

We have added to the manuscript text (paragraph three, Results and Discussion) to clarify this point. However, we feel that the most convincing evidence that darting is a conditioned response is the fact that CS-specific darting can be observed in female Darters at the start of extinction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>), when the animal does not experience any footshocks. This response is predicted by the presence of darting during conditioning. It is also important to note that during conditioning, female Darters show increased propensity to dart specifically during the tone. We argue that these observations collectively constitute strong evidence that darting is a conditioned response."

In an unpaired CS-US design, the CS would signal safety (Pollak et al., 2010), and thus we would not expect to observe increased darting to the CS as we do in a paired design here. But because of the large scale of the current study, the novelty of the sex-specific findings within, and the topical nature of these findings with respect to recent changes in NIH policy, we felt it was appropriate to report the current findings before undertaking another large-scale study."

This is indeed what we observe, as can be seen in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. It\u2019s worth noting that in both referenced papers, animals underwent a comparably weak conditioning procedure \u2013 either \u201cpartial\u201d conditioning (Gozzi et al., 2010) or a single CS-US pairing (Metna Laurent et al., 2012) vs. our 7 CS-US pairings \u2013 and were tested for fear memory/extinction during a single 6- or 8-minute CS exposure, vs. our 90 minute, 20 CS extinction session.

Moreover, we observe conditioned darting in females of all estrous stages (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</a>) as well as in a few males, suggesting that conditioned darting is not simply indicative of female proceptivity. There is also no aspect of the task that could be expected to elicit sexual behaviors in females (e.g. there is no male or male pheromones present during the behavior)."

Although males clearly weigh more than females, we feel these data suggest that weight alone cannot account for the incidence of darting."
