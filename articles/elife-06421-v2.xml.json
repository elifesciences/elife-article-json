The divergent non-motor regions flanking the ATPase domain are critical in regulating its targeting and activity. However, the molecular basis for the function of the non-motor regions within the context of full-length MCAK is unknown. Here, we determine the structure of MCAK motor domain bound to its regulatory C-terminus. Our analysis reveals that the MCAK C-terminus binds to two motor domains in solution and is displaced allosterically upon microtubule binding, which allows its robust accumulation at microtubule ends. These results demonstrate that MCAK undergoes long-range conformational changes involving its C-terminus during the soluble to microtubule-bound transition and that the C-terminus-motor interaction represents a structural intermediate in the MCAK catalytic cycle. Together, our work reveals intrinsic molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of kinesin-13 activity."

The divergent non-motor regions flanking the ATPase domain are critical in regulating its targeting and activity. However, the molecular basis for the function of the non-motor regions within the context of full-length MCAK is unknown. Here, we determine the structure of MCAK motor domain bound to its regulatory C-terminus. Our analysis reveals that the MCAK C-terminus binds to two motor domains in solution and is displaced allosterically upon microtubule binding, which allows its robust accumulation at microtubule ends. These results demonstrate that MCAK undergoes long-range conformational changes involving its C-terminus during the soluble to microtubule-bound transition and that the C-terminus-motor interaction represents a structural intermediate in the MCAK catalytic cycle. Together, our work reveals intrinsic molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of kinesin-13 activity."

One end of the protein, known as the C-terminus, controls the activity of this motor domain. However, it is not clear how this works."

A short stretch of amino acids\u2014the building blocks of proteins\u2014in the C-terminus interacts with two motor molecules. This \u2018motif\u2019 is also found in other similar proteins from a variety of animals. However, once MCAK binds to a microtubule, the microtubule triggers the release of the C-terminus from the motor domain. This allows MCAK to bind more strongly to the microtubule."

Unlike processive kinesin motors, which have a motor domain at one end followed by a long coiled-coil and a globular tail, Kinesin-13 proteins possess a conserved motor domain containing the ATPase activity, flanked by two non-structured regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The neck region, N-terminal to the motor, and the motor domain form the minimal region necessary for robust microtubule depolymerization (<a href=\"#bib27\">Maney et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ovechkina et al., 2002</a>). The divergent regions flanking the motor domain are important for regulating its enzymatic activity, spatial targeting, dimerization, and creating unique kinesin functional specificity (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib48\">Welburn, 2013</a>). The N terminus of the kinesin-13 MCAK (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, also known as Kif2c) is responsible for its localization at kinetochores where it binds Sgo2, and to the plus ends of microtubules where it associates with the end binding (EB) proteins (<a href=\"#bib46\">Walczak et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Maney et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mennella et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Tanno et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Welburn and Cheeseman, 2012</a>). Interestingly, the last 9 amino acids within the C terminus of MCAK are also necessary for plus tip tracking (<a href=\"#bib31\">Moore et al., 2005</a>). The region C-terminal to the motor domain (residues 584\u2013725) has been proposed to enable MCAK dimerization, but also to interact with the N terminus independently of the motor region (<a href=\"#bib28\">Maney et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hertzer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ems-McClung et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ems-McClung et al., 2013</a>). Additional work suggests the existence of long-range interactions between non-motor regions of MCAK in the context of full-length MCAK (<a href=\"#bib30\">Moore and Wordeman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hertzer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ems-McClung et al., 2013</a>). The nature and the function of these inter- and intra-molecular interactions within the MCAK dimer are not known."

The regions that ultimately regulate MCAK targeting and fine-tune the catalytic activity of full-length MCAK lie outside of the motor region.

However, conflicting studies have proposed that the C-terminal tail of MCAK can either inhibit or activate the MCAK depolymerase activity (<a href=\"#bib30\">Moore and Wordeman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hertzer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>).

However, the monomeric motor domain does not function in isolation, as full-length MCAK is a physiological dimer (<a href=\"#bib28\">Maney et al., 2001</a>). Recent studies utilizing a FRET probe fused to the neck linker region of MCAK and the C terminus revealed that full-length MCAK switches from a \u2018closed\u2019 to \u2018open\u2019 conformation upon microtubule binding, but the trigger for this conformational change is unknown. MCAK is also thought to adopt a \u2018closed\u2019 conformation at microtubule ends (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ems-McClung et al., 2013</a>). The nucleotide state also influences the structure of full-length MCAK and induces a conformational change, as measured by deuterium exchange (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burns et al., 2014</a>). These studies suggest that full-length MCAK undergoes large dynamic structural changes during its catalytic cycle and upon binding to microtubules. However, the structure and organization of these flanking regions, and the trigger of the conformational changes remain uncharacterized."

Our data establish that the MCAK motor domain binds to a 25 residue peptide from the extreme C terminus, termed the C-terminal tail (CT) domain. The CT domain induces motor dimerization in solution, reminiscent of the self-interaction mechanism of Kinesin-1 with its C terminus (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kaan et al., 2011</a>). The crystal structure of the MCAK C-terminal tail bound to the motor domain reveals how the C-terminal domain stabilizes a dimeric MCAK motor configuration. We also show that the MCAK C terminus controls the affinity of full-length MCAK for microtubules and reduces its association with the lattice to ensure maximal recruitment to microtubule ends, where MCAK can act as a depolymerase. When present in solution, the MCAK C-terminus binds to the motor domain. However, upon microtubule binding, the C terminus is displaced from the motor. This step is triggered by the microtubule itself, independently of the E-hook of tubulin and is necessary to allow binding of the motor to microtubules, and stimulate MCAK depolymerase activity. Within the context of the full-length MCAK, this indicates that MCAK undergoes long-range conformational changes driven by its C terminus during its soluble to microtubule-bound transition. Overall, our work presents a new paradigm for kinesin regulation by microtubules rather than their cargos, and provides important insights into the mechanism and regulation of MCAK to control microtubule dynamics and ensure proper genome stability."

This limits the head movement of one kinesin with respect to the other (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stock et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hackney and Stock, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kaan et al., 2011</a>). We sought to test whether the C-terminal tail domain of MCAK, which has been proposed to regulate MCAK activity (<a href=\"#bib30\">Moore and Wordeman, 2004</a>), was sufficient to interact with the motor domain. To do this, we expressed the N-terminal and motor region (residues 1\u2013583, termed NM) or the motor region of MCAK along with the neck linker region (residues 181\u2013583, termed M) as His-tagged proteins, and the C-terminal MCAK tail (residues 700\u2013725, termed CT domain) as a GST fusion protein (<a href=\"#bib30\">Moore and Wordeman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hertzer et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Following cleavage and removal of the GST fusion, the CT domain alone was unable to interact with itself through dimerization, based on the absence of binding between the CT domain and GST-CT domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, right lane). We cannot however exclude a very tight interaction between two CT domains. In contrast, the GST-CT domain protein bound to both the NM and M domains of MCAK as a stable complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In addition, the CT domain bound the motor domain independently of the GST (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

Full-length MCAK is a dimer in solution (<a href=\"#bib28\">Maney et al., 2001</a>). Therefore, we sought to test whether the CT domain interacts with one or two motor domains. To define the stoichiometry of this interaction, we subjected the complex to analytical size-exclusion chromatography. The motor domain alone behaves as a monomer and eluted with an apparent size of \u223c45 kDa. When the MCAK motor and the CT domain were incubated together and subjected to analytical size-exclusion chromatography, the elution peak shifted to an earlier fraction, suggesting dimerization of the MCAK motor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Using SDS-PAGE analysis, we confirmed that the shift to a larger complex was due to the interaction of the motor domain with the CT domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, bottom). Size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments further indicated that, in the absence of the CT domain, over 90% of the motor domain was monomeric (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), with a molecular weight of \u223c45.3 kDa measured with under 3 kDa accuracy, in agreement with the theoretical molecular weight of \u223c46.1 kDa (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The predicted masses for complexes of one and two CT domains bound to two motor domains are \u223c94.2 and 97.7 kDa, respectively. The measured molecular weight for the motor-CT domain complex was \u223c91.5 kDa, suggesting the complex consists of two motors bound to one CT domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). Since the CT domain is unlikely to dimerize alone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), we conclude that the MCAK CT domain induces the dimerization of the motor domains cooperatively."

The asymmetric unit contains four molecules of the motor domain assembled into two dimers (chains A and B, C and D) and in a spacegroup distinct from the MCAK motor crystallized alone. The dimerization interface involves packing of the MCAK motor domains along their helix \u03b11 and \u03b23 sheet, close to helix \u03b10 and loop L1, which form the neck linker region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). From the Fo-Fc electron density map, we could observe interpretable electron density close to the interface between chains A and B and build residues 710 to 716 of the CT domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We found that a single CT domain binds to both motor domains, close to their neck linker regions.

The head-to-head motor arrangement is quasi-symmetrical, with the CT domain stabilizing the interface between two motor domains. However, the peptide does not sit on a twofold crystallographic axis and binds asymmetrically to the dimer, unlike the Kinesin-1 tail.

However, it is obstructed by symmetry-related molecules in the asymmetric unit. Chain C and D assemble similarly as dimers, with one potential binding site also obstructed by a symmetry-related molecule. Interestingly, at the second site, the Glu244/C side chain points outwards to the solvent and is incompatible with binding of the CT domain (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In the CT domain-bound dimer, the side chain of Glu244/A is rearranged and points towards chain B and is stabilized by a salt bridge with Lys286/B. The imidazole ring of His257/B also moves backwards, allowing the CT domain to bind. Thus the motor domains can dimerize, but the CT domain stabilizes this dimeric motor assembly after rearrangement of Glutamate 244 and Histidine 257 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

The carboxyl side chain of Glu711 forms a hydrogen bond with His257/B, while the carboxyl group of Glu712 is hydrogen bonded to the amide group of Thr 242/A. Additional hydrogen bonds stabilize the peptide-motor complex through main chain interactions. The backbone amide group of Glu712 is stabilized with the backbone carbonyl group of Ala241/A and the backbone amide of Ser715 hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl group of Cys245/A. Although the hydroxyl group of Ser715 does not interact directly with the motor domain, it does point inwards towards the motor domain.

Overlaying our structure with the mouse MCAK structure reveals that the conformation of the neck linker region in the mouse MCAK/Kif2c structure does not allow binding of the CT domain, due to steric hindrance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The neck region of MCAK has been shown previously to be critical for the depolymerase activity of MCAK (<a href=\"#bib28\">Maney et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ovechkina et al., 2002</a>). It is therefore possible that disruption of the CT domain-motor interaction allows conformational changes in the neck region that are necessary for catalysis. Taken together, our work reveals that one MCAK CT domain acts directly to stabilize the formation of a dimeric MCAK through an extended interface, where the neck linker lies on the face opposite of the microtubule binding site."

Ser715 has been reported to be phosphorylated in vitro by Aurora A and Plk1 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">2011</a>). In our crystal structure, the hydroxyl group of Ser715 is in close proximity to His246 and Glu244. A larger side chain would cause steric hindrance and prevent the CT domain-motor domain association. To test whether the nature of the side chain at position 715 can regulate the interaction between the motor domain of MCAK and its CT domain, we generated GST-CT<sub>S715E</sub> and GST-CT<sub>S715A</sub> constructs. Although the GST-CT and GST-CT<sub>S715A</sub> domains bound to the motor domain, the GST-CT<sub>S715E</sub> domain did not interact with the motor domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In addition, the motor domain did not co-migrate with the CT<sub>S715E</sub> domain by gel filtration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Based on the crystal structure of the CT domain-motor complex, post-translational modification of this residue would destabilize the interaction through electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance. This demonstrates that the conserved side chains of Glu711, Glu712, and Ser715 are critical for stabilizing the binding of the CT domain to the motor domain. Taken together, our data suggest that the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between the MCAK C terminus and the motor domain is highly conserved across species."

The microtubule depolymerase activity of full-length MCAK<sub>S715E</sub>, in which the CT domain can no longer bind to the motor domain, appeared similar to wild type MCAK in microtubule depolymerization assays (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). However there are limitations to this assay, as we were only able to measure the rate of microtubule depolymerization using cosedimentation assays for a given MCAK concentration rather than examining single MCAK molecules at microtubule ends. It is possible that a change in MCAK microtubule binding affinity will have a counteracting effect on MCAK diffusion rate or the rate of tubulin removal at ends as previously shown (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cooper et al., 2010</a>). In this case, the overall depolymerase activity that our assay measures may remain unchanged because the increase in affinity of MCAK for the microtubule lattice may cause a reduction in two-dimensional diffusion and consequently a reduction in microtubule end targeting. As MCAK and MCAK<sub>S715E</sub> displayed a similar depolymerase activity in our in vitro depolymerase assay, this raises the possibility that the CT domain acts indirectly as an inhibitor and has an additional distinct cellular function."

                                "text": "To test the contribution of the CT domain to MCAK activity and function, we designed a system to generate an inducible covalent CT domain-motor complex in vitro based on our structure to control for the displacement of the CT domain from the motor domain. Cys287/A in Loop 1 of the motor domain is in close proximity to the CT domain, with the side chain of Glu712 and the sulfhydryl group of Cys287 pointing towards each other (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Therefore, we mutated Glu712 to a cysteine to generate a disulfide bridge between the peptide and the motor domain, estimated to be \u223c3 \u00c5 under oxidizing conditions. First, we purified full-length MCAK<sub>E712C</sub>. In presence of reducing agent (DTT), full-length MCAK<sub>E712C</sub> eluted as one complex, of similar size to MCAK (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Under oxidizing conditions (without DTT) MCAK<sub>E712C</sub> ran similarly to MCAK on an SDS-PAGE gel (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). However, we were not able to determine the efficiency of the covalent attachment between Cysteine 712 and Cysteine 287. To test that a covalent linkage had been achieved, we expressed the cleavable GST-CT<sub>E712C</sub> domain. Under oxidizing conditions (without DTT), the motor and both the GST-CT<sub>E712C</sub> domain and untagged CT<sub>E712C</sub> domain formed a covalent complex (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Analytical gel filtration of the GST-CT<sub>E712C</sub>\u2014bound motor complex eluted as a single peak, earlier than the peak for the motor alone (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). However, SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that, within the assembled complex, there was one free motor and one motor covalent bound to the GST-CT<sub>E712C</sub> domain. This indicates that one CT domain binds to two motors, only one of which is crosslinked (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B,E,F</a>). Based on our structural analysis, binding of one CT domain to one of the motors in the dimer would not obstruct the solvent accessibility of the second Cys287. Thus, this experiment suggests that within a CT domain-motor complex, one CT domain binds to two motor domains, consistent with the stoichiometry we determined using SEC-MALS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We also noted that the covalent attachment of the CT domain to the motor domain would also prevent any conformational rearrangement and repositioning of the neck region close to the microtubule-binding interface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) and may thus decrease its microtubule depolymerase activity."

                                "text": "Full-length MCAK has been proposed to undergo large conformational changes upon binding to microtubules, although the underlying mechanism is unclear (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ems-McClung et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Burns et al., 2014</a>). Based on our data, we hypothesized that in solution, the CT domain binds to the motor, but that the CT domain is displaced when the motor binds to microtubules. To test whether MCAK has a reduced ability to bind to microtubules when the CT domain is bound to the motor, we first performed cosedimentation assays with full-length MCAK<sub>E712C</sub>. In the presence of DTT, MCAK<sub>E712C</sub> bound to microtubules similarly to wild type full-length MCAK. However, under oxidizing conditions (absence of DTT), the affinity of MCAK<sub>E712C</sub> for microtubules was reduced and a fraction of MCAK<sub>E712C</sub> did not bind microtubules, even at saturating microtubule concentrations (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). This indicates that the binding of the CT domain of MCAK to the motor interferes with MCAK binding to microtubules. To further dissect the effect of the CT domain on the motor domain in the context of microtubules, we performed cosedimentation assays with the CT<sub>E712C</sub> domain-motor domain complex with increasing concentrations of microtubules. If tubulin within the microtubule is necessary to displace the CT domain and allow binding of the motor to microtubules, we hypothesized that only the non-covalently bound MCAK motor would be able to undergo the conformational change necessary for binding to microtubules, whereas the CT domain-bound MCAK motor (M-CT<sub>E712C</sub>) fraction would be in a locked conformation and would not bind or only bind weakly. Cosedimentation of the motor domain in the presence of the CT<sub>E712C</sub> domain and DTT was similar to the MCAK motor alone with K<sub>d</sub>s of 0.44 and 0.64 \u03bcM respectively, indicating that the CT<sub>E712C</sub> domain did not interfere with the motor under reducing conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Similarly, the addition of DTT did not affect the affinity of MCAK motor in presence of the CT domain (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). In contrast, addition of the CT<sub>E712C</sub> domain to the MCAK motor under oxidizing conditions reduced the fraction of MCAK bound to microtubules by \u223c50%, indicating that half of the CT domain-bound MCAK motor (M-CT<sub>E712C</sub>) sample did not bind to microtubules (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). In these samples, only MCAK motor that was not bound to the CT domain cosedimented with microtubules. Also we did not detect the CT and CT<sub>E712C</sub> domains in the microtubule-bound, pelleted samples (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). This demonstrates that the binding of MCAK to its C terminal tail region and to microtubules is mutually exclusive."

Next, we incubated the CT<sub>E712C</sub> domain with the motor in presence and absence of DTT to generate unbound and CT<sub>E712C</sub>-bound MCAK motor. In presence of DTT, the CT<sub>E712C</sub> domain did not bind the MCAK motor and the depolymerase activity was similar to that of the wild type MCAK motor alone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). However, in absence of DTT, the CT<sub>E712C</sub> domain bound-MCAK motor displayed reduced depolymerase activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). The activity of this motor-CT<sub>E712C</sub> domain complex is likely to be lower than that of the observed apparent activity due to the presence of a non-covalently bound MCAK fraction, which functions as a fully active depolymerase (\u223c45\u201350%, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). We calculated the specific activity by taking into account the fraction of active MCAK (\u223c50%, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>\u2013blue dotted line). This shows that the covalent binding of CT<sub>E712C</sub> to MCAK motor strongly inhibits the depolymerase activity of MCAK. Overall, this demonstrates that the displacement of the CT domain is necessary for the full microtubule depolymerization activity of MCAK."

To test this, we treated microtubules for 10 and 120 min with subtilisin to remove the C-terminal tails of \u03b2 and \u03b1/\u03b2-tubulin, respectively (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Cosedimentation of the motor-CT domain complex in presence of subtilisin-treated microtubules revealed that the CT domain was displaced from the motor and remained in the supernatant, while the motor domain bound with a high affinity to the tubulin lattice (Kd = 0.2 \u03bcM) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>).

In addition, we found that the CT domain reduces the ability of full-length MCAK to bind to microtubules (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Therefore, we predicted that full-length MCAK<sub>S715E</sub>, in which the CT domain is unable to interact with the motor domains would have a higher affinity for microtubules than wild type full-length MCAK. To test this, we measured the affinity of full-length wild type MCAK and MCAK<sub>S715E</sub> for microtubules using a cosedimentation assay.

Thus to date the regions of MCAK responsible for diffusion remain unclear. Based on the CT domain controlling the affinity of MCAK for microtubules redundantly with the C-terminal tail of tubulin, we hypothesized that this electrostatically charged CT region may play also a role in MCAK diffusion on the lattice and targeting to microtubule ends (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). To test whether the CT domain of MCAK controls the targeting of MCAK by decreasing MCAK affinity for the microtubule lattice, we examined the localization of full-length MCAK and MCAK<sub>S715E</sub> in HeLa cells. GFP-MCAK<sub>S715E</sub> targeted weakly to microtubule plus ends but also accumulated on the microtubule lattice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), confirming our in vitro observation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>). In contrast, GFP-MCAK was robustly targeted to microtubule ends and co-localized with mCherry-EB3. Future work will address whether the CT domain is the main region providing direct lattice diffusion properties to MCAK through electrostatic interactions. In total, these data suggest that the CT domain reduces the affinity of MCAK for microtubules and may be the electrostatic tether that allows MCAK specific targeting to microtubule ends."

Our results reveal a regulatory paradigm for the Kinesin-13 microtubule depolymerases, which are functionally and structurally distinct from processive kinesins. Previously, the molecular organization of full-length dimeric kinesin depolymerases and the inhibitory mechanisms for kinesin depolymerases were unclear. Here, we show that in solution, the C terminus of MCAK interacts with the two motor domains through long-range interactions. Binding of the CT domain and microtubules to the motor is mutually exclusive. While the acidic tails of tubulin control the affinity of MCAK for microtubules, they are not necessary for the displacement of the MCAK CT domain from the motor. The tubulin subunit itself triggers the removal of the CT domain from the motor, most likely through a conformational change within the microtubule-binding region in the motor domain. Disruption of this interaction causes MCAK to bind more strongly to microtubules, which leads to the accumulation of MCAK along the microtubule lattice and is disadvantageous for a microtubule-depolymerizing enzyme that acts at microtubule ends. Removal of the tubulin C termini also increases the affinity of MCAK for the microtubule lattice. Therefore, we propose that both the CT domain of MCAK and the C termini tubulin have important functions to reduce the affinity of MCAK for the microtubule lattice and facilitate MCAK diffusion, in part through electrostatic repulsion, in agreement with previous observations on a tailless MCAK (<a href=\"#bib30\">Moore and Wordeman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Helenius et al., 2006</a>). The CT domain of MCAK has a predominant effect on controlling MCAK affinity through intramolecular interactions, possibly through weak intramolecular interactions with the motor not engaged with the lattice or by interfering with the E-hook of tubulin. Taken together, both the CT domain of MCAK dimers and the acidic tails of tubulin effectively contribute to efficient microtubule lattice engagement, plus tip targeting, and activation of the depolymerase (<a href=\"#bib22\">Helenius et al., 2006</a>). This model could explain why MCAK activity is stimulated by the microtubule lattice and requires both its CT domain and the C terminus of tubulin for optimal activity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Niederstrasser et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Helenius et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cooper et al., 2010</a>)."

The extreme C terminus of MCAK binds to the motor domain in solution and this interaction is abrogated upon MCAK binding to microtubules. This implies that a major microtubule-induced conformational change in MCAK occurs by disrupting the regulated interaction of the motor with the CT domain, which is triggered by the microtubule lattice itself. This event may also allow and require rearrangement of the neck region, which can swing into two distinct conformations on opposite faces of the MCAK motor domain. Recent work reported that MCAK undergoes long-range conformational changes upon binding to microtubules based on FRET (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ems-McClung et al., 2013</a>), although the nature of the change was unknown. Aurora B phosphorylation of the neck region has been proposed to control the long-range interactions with a C-terminal non-motor region of MCAK, however the molecular basis for this regulatory mechanism was lacking. Recent low resolution studies using deuterium-exchange and mass spectrometry also indicated that the C terminus of MCAK within the context of the full-length MCAK is more stable in solution than in the presence of microtubules (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ems-McClung et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Burns et al., 2014</a>).

Kinesin-1, Kif17, and CENP-E can each undergo self-inhibition in solution to limit squandering of ATP (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coy et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Friedman and Vale, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hackney and Stock, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Espeut et al., 2008</a>). We currently only have molecular insights into the inhibitory mechanism for Kinesin-1, where one C-terminus binds at the interface between two motor domains to inhibit the molecular motor (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hackney et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kaan et al., 2011</a>). Here, we demonstrate that certain features of the molecular inhibitory mechanism for processive kinesins can be extended to depolymerizing kinesins despite their different structural arrangement but that the function of this self-interaction is distinct. In both cases, the C terminus acts allosterically and stabilizes a motor domain dimer through a second dimerization site, distinct from the major dimerization domain (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kaan et al., 2011</a>). However, in the structure of the Kinesin-1 tail complex, the tail binds on a twofold symmetry axis utilizing two ionic interactions. The tail binds symmetrically and in both directions on the motor around a twofold symmetry axis. We found that the MCAK CT domain binds asymmetrically with multiple interactions with the motor domain and adopts only one potential orientation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Once this occurs, the interaction of the tail with the MCAK motor displays a reduced affinity for microtubules, similarly to Kinesin-1. However, while Kinesin-1 auto-inhibition reduces ATPase activity, the C terminus of MCAK does not interfere with ATP hydrolysis in solution (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hackney and Stock, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Moore and Wordeman, 2004</a>). In addition, unlike motile kinesins, the alleviation of MCAK auto-inhibition is not stimulated by cargo proteins, but rather by the microtubule lattice itself, although the removal of the tail is in both cases electrostatically-driven (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stock et al., 1999</a>). In total, our work reveals that regulation of self-interactions in the kinesin superfamily emerges as a conserved feature, but that the nature of their regulation is distinct between processive and depolymerizing kinesins. Future structural work on MCAK will help us understand how this potent non-canonical kinesin functions in vivo."

Protein concentrations were determined with a combination of Bradford protein assays and densitometry of Coomassie-stained gels relative to a BSA standard.

A Cary 2200 spectrophotometer was used to measure absorption spectra; fluorescence was measured using an ISS K2 spectrofluorometer at 25\u00b0C. The intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan and aromatic amino acids after excitation at 295 nm and 280 nm, respectively was recorded through an Ealing 340 nm centre-wavelength filter. The emission spectra were measured from 300 to 400 nm. The motor domain was diluted to 1 \u03bcM in spectroscopy buffer. First, the emission spectrum for the motor domain alone was recorded. Then the following concentrations of CT domain peptide, cleaved from GST and further purified, were titrated: 0, 60, 120, 240, 480, 960, 1920, 3840, 7680, and 15,660 nM. The starting volume was 3 ml before peptide addition and was never increased more than 1% to negate any effect on fluorescence measurements. Because of the presence of GST (5% of the total peptide) all measurement was corrected with measurement of buffer containing the same concentration of peptide. The change in fluorescence was calculated after they were normalized against each concentration of the CT domain alone in the spectroscopy buffer, to correct for non-specific fluorescence."

The authors use their data to support a model in which the C-terminal peptide reduces the affinity of the MCAK motor domain for the lattice of the microtubule, allowing it to diffuse to the ends where its activity is required."

They have already clarified that the Cys-containing C-terminal peptide does not bind MCAK under reducing conditions, i.e. it does not trigger dimerization of MCAK. So the binding affinity for MTs they are observing now is the binding affinity of the monomeric motor domain for MTs. Next, the authors remove the reducing agent and observe that the fraction of MCAK bound to MTs has decreased. They claim that this is the expected behavior and illustrate the result in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> by showing that two equimolar populations of MCAK form, one of which can bind MTs and one of which cannot. This expectation is not well justified. How much of each of these two populations is represented depends on the concentration of peptide and on the time the peptide is given to form a covalent bond with MCAK, so that telling what is the expected result for this experiment is very hard unless all the reaction parameters are at hand. If it is true that the MCAK motor domain dimer:peptide has no or lower binding affinity for MT, peptide addition should result in progressively lower MCAK binding as a function of the concentration of C-terminal peptide and the time it is allowed to interact with MCAK."

This theory is downplayed in the present version and the authors could try to do the experiment in a simpler and more convincing setting. They don't need a covalent linker. They have created a full length MCAK with the S715E mutant, which they claim prevents binding of the C-terminal peptide to the motor domain. They can simply measure the binding affinity of this construct, which is because another segment of MCAK makes it be dimeric (SEC-MALS analysis in the subsection headed \u201cThe C terminus stabilizes full-length MCAK in solution\u201d), in the presence of growing concentrations of free C-terminal peptide. As there should be no intra-molecular competition from the C-terminal tail (due to the S715E mutation) this experiment will clarify the actual effects of the C-terminal peptide in the absence of other confounding effects, particularly the underlying monomer-dimer equilibrium of the MCAK motor domain."

So the binding affinity for MTs they are observing now is the binding affinity of the monomeric motor domain for MTs. Next, the authors remove the reducing agent and observe that the fraction of MCAK bound to MTs has decreased.
