Here we describe a novel mechanism regulating TLR2 protein expression and subsequent cytokine release through the ubiquitination and degradation of the receptor in response to ligand stimulation. We show a new mechanism in which an uncharacterized RING finger E3 ligase, PPP1R11, directly ubiquitinates TLR2 both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to TLR2 degradation and disruption of the signaling cascade. Lentiviral gene transfer or knockdown of PPP1R11 in mouse lungs significantly affects lung inflammation and the clearance of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. There is a negative correlation between PPP1R11 and TLR2 levels in white blood cell samples isolated from patients with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections. These results suggest that PPP1R11 plays an important role in regulating innate immunity and gram-positive bacterial clearance by functioning, in part, through the ubiquitination and degradation of TLR2."

Here we describe a novel mechanism regulating TLR2 protein expression and subsequent cytokine release through the ubiquitination and degradation of the receptor in response to ligand stimulation. We show a new mechanism in which an uncharacterized RING finger E3 ligase, PPP1R11, directly ubiquitinates TLR2 both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to TLR2 degradation and disruption of the signaling cascade. Lentiviral gene transfer or knockdown of PPP1R11 in mouse lungs significantly affects lung inflammation and the clearance of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. There is a negative correlation between PPP1R11 and TLR2 levels in white blood cell samples isolated from patients with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infections. These results suggest that PPP1R11 plays an important role in regulating innate immunity and gram-positive bacterial clearance by functioning, in part, through the ubiquitination and degradation of TLR2."

                        "text": "The human toll-like receptor (TLR) family consists of ten family members (TLR1-TLR10)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Chuang and Ulevitch, 2004</a>). TLRs are single transmembrane pattern recognition receptors that recognize molecules derived from various pathogens, referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Crespo-Lessmann et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib13\">Delgado et al., 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib16\">Esen and Kielian, 2006</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib6\">Chalifour et al., 2004</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib45\">Tobian et al., 2003</a>) . TLRs are highly conserved from invertebrates to mammals, and are essential for mediating innate immunity and the production of cytokines in response to infectious agents (<a href=\"#bib36\">O'Neill, 2000</a>). All TLRs share common structural features, including multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRR), a transmembrane domain, and a conserved cytoplasmic Toll\u2212interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) domain (TIR domain)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Chuang and Ulevitch, 2004</a>) . Specifically, LRR motifs from individual TLRs provide ligand binding sites for diverse PAMPs, whereas the TIR domain interacts with several intracellular proteins such as MyD88, which is essential for the transduction of downstream signaling (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fitzgerald et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Xu et al., 2000</a>). Within the TLR family, TLR2 possesses the unique ability to recognize glycolipids, lipopeptides, lipoproteins, and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria. Thus, TLR2 is the key element of innate immunity that defends against gram-positive bacteria (<a href=\"#bib38\">Raby et al., 2013</a>). TLR2 is expressed not only in immune cells, but is also present in pulmonary alveoli and airway epithelial cells, suggesting that it plays a role in mucosal innate immunity and infection-induced lung injury (<a href=\"#bib7\">Charles\u00a0et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hertz\u00a0et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hoth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jiang\u00a0et al., 2005</a>). Interestingly, TLR2 deficient mice are highly susceptible to <i>S. aureus</i> infection (<a href=\"#bib43\">Takeuchi et al., 2000</a>), and in humans, a loss-of-function TLR2 mutation has been linked to susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases, faster disease progression, and a more severe course of sepsis in critically ill patients (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bronkhorst et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Janardhanan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Nachtigall et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Stappers et al., 2014</a>). These studies illustrate the protective role of TLR2 in response to inflammatory insults and infectious diseases. Therefore, TLR2 augmentation may be a novel therapeutic strategy in the fight against gram-positive infection."

First, using ATP, the catalytically active cysteine (C) residue of the E1-activating enzyme forms a high energy thioester bond to the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin (Ub) and then, using another ATP, transfers it to the active center C of the E2 Ub conjugating enzyme (Ubc)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Jin et al., 2007</a>). Finally, the C-terminus of Ub is attached to the \u03b5-amino lysine (K) residue of the substrate, mediated by an E3 ligase that typically targets a substrate marked by a particular post-translational degron (<a href=\"#bib41\">Skaar et al., 2013</a>). The mechanism of protein ubiquitination is dependent on the type of E3 ligase: SCF, RING finger, U-box, or HECT (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Skaar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hatakeyama et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dikic and Robertson, 2012</a>). Of the many E3 ligases, the RING finger domain E3 superfamily remains poorly characterized. Functional data are available for only about a dozen of the over 300 predicted ligases, such as MDM2 and several RNF and TRIM proteins (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fang et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Joazeiro and Weissman, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lorick et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Metzger et al., 2012</a>). RING finger E3 ligases contain a unique RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger domain that consists of two zinc finger type domains (<a href=\"#bib2\">Borden and Freemont, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Freemont et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lovering et al., 1993</a>). In this study, we characterize a previously undescribed RING finger E3 ligase family member, PPP1R11, and identify its role in regulating cytokine secretion through targeted TLR2 protein ubiquitination and degradation. These studies describe a new molecular mechanism contributing to mucosal innate immunity."

                                "text": "We first investigated TLR2 protein degradation using a transformed murine lung epithelial (MLE) cell line. MLE cells express high levels of TLR2 protein (Data not shown). Cells were stimulated with the TLR2 ligand, Pam3CSK4, and TLR2 protein levels decreased after 4 hr. However, co-treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 preserved TLR2 protein levels, while treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin did not. Further, cell lysates from these treatments were subjected to TLR2 immunoprecipitation and Ubiquitin immunoblotting. High molecular weight ubiquitin signals in TLR2 immunoprecipitate were detected only in cell lysates treated with MG-132 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Taken together, this suggests that the TLR2 ligand, Pam3CSK4, induces the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of TLR2 via the proteasome. We also investigated the type of ubiquitin linkage on TLR2 using a UbiCRest (Ubiquitin Chain Restriction Analysis) assay (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hospenthal et al., 2015</a>). Polyubiquitinated TLR2 was subjected to several deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) that target specific ubiquitin linkages (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, USP2, a DUB that non-specifically targets all ubiquitin linkages, completely reduced polyubiquitinated TLR2. We also observed a drastic decrease in TLR2 ubiquitination in the OTUB1 treated sample, which suggests that TLR2 ubiquitination is regulated in part through K48 ubiquitin linkage. We also observed K48-specific ubiquitin linkage of TLR2 following TLR2 immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). MG-132 dramatically increased the half-life of TLR2 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and Ubiquitin overexpression drastically reduced TLR2 protein levels and half-life (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

Ectopic expression of PPP1R11 triggered TLR2 degradation in a dose dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) without affecting its mRNA levels (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Furthermore, ectopic PPP1R11 expression significantly decreased the half-life of TLR2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), whereas PPP1R11 knockdown markedly increased its lifespan (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Conversely, we observed no effect on TLR2 decay with the expression and silencing of fellow RING E3 ligase PCGF1 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013E</a>). To confirm PPP1R11 as an authentic TLR2 target, we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay using TLR2 as the substrate and observed polyubiquitination of TLR2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>)."

Control patients were mechanically ventilated patients intubated for airway protection without clinical evidence of or risk factors for ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), while <i>S. aureus</i>-infected patients had evidence of <i>S. aureus</i> in tracheal aspirates, blood, or both, and had evidence of or risk factors for ARDS. In control patients, we observed no correlation between PPP1R11 and TLR2 levels, but observed a significantly negative PPP1R11/TLR2 correlation in <i>S. aureus</i>-infected patients. We interpret these data to suggest that during <i>S. aureus</i> infection, TLR2 levels may be attenuated in part by PPP1R11 expression.

They are characterized by the unique property of auto-ubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amemiya et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</a>). We confirmed that PPP1R11 is an authentic ring finger E3 ligase by showing its ability to auto-ubiquitinate in the presence of ubiquitin, E1, and several different E2 conjugating enzymes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). We also showed that several E2 conjugating enzymes such as UBE2R1 and UBE2D2 preferably interact with PPP1R11 in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). Lastly, we showed that PPP1R11 interacts with endogenous UBE2D2 through cellular co-immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). We also selectively mutated several key residues of PPP1R11 putative RING finger (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>) and showed their loss-of-function in inducing TLR2 degradation (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). H126 was chosen as negative control since it is outside of the RING finger domains. The effect of PPP1R11 was specific to TLR2, as an\u00a0ectopic expression of PPP1R11 did not alter TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, or TLR9 protein levels (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). These experiments suggest that PPP1R11 is an authentic RING finger E3 ligase that specifically induces TLR2 ubiquitination and degradation."

We observed a time-dependent increase in PPP1R11 protein levels and decrease in TLR2 protein levels with this treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Further, cell lysates from these conditions were subjected to TLR2 immunoprecipitation, and high levels of PPP1R11 protein were detected in cells treated with Pam3CSK4 for 4 and 6 hr. PPP1R11/TLR2 association at these time points also reflects the highest degree of TLR2 protein loss (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We also examined the role of PPP1R11 in Pam3CSK4-induced TLR2 protein degradation, and upon ectopic expression of PPP1R11, we observed an accelerated decay of TLR2 protein with Pam3CSK4 treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Last, we performed PPP1R11 knockdown in MLE cells, and we observed stabilized TLR2 protein levels as well as less ubiquitination upon Pam3CSK4 treatment as compared to control siRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). TLR2 immunoprecipitation also showed protein ubiquitination beginning at 1 hr post Pam3CSK4 treatment, which is consistent with increased PPP1R11/TLR2 association (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). These studies suggest that the TLR2 ligand, Pam3CSK4, induces TLR2 degradation, in part, through the ubiquitination of TLR2 by the E3 ligase PPP1R11."

                                "text": "We also generated a series of TLR2 lysine mutants to further characterize the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer to TLR2. Mutation of lysine 754 to arginine (K754R) within TLR2 resulted in its highest level of stability, a much extended half-life (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and resistance to Pam3CSK4-induced degradation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). K754R TLR2 is also resistant to in vitro ubiquitination and degradation during PPP1R11 co-expression (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). We confirmed that the K754R mutant TLR2 is expressed and localized normally in cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). This suggests that the extended stability of the TLR2 K754R mutant is due to its inability to be ubiquitinated by PPP1R11 and that K754 is a potential PPP1R11 ubiquitination site within TLR2. Since Pam3CSK4 induces the TLR2 signaling pathway that leads to cytokine release, we hypothesized that by ubiquitinating TLR2, the E3 ligase PPP1R11 is able to suppress the TLR2 signaling pathway. Indeed, ectopic expression of PPP1R11 reduces both IL-6 and CXCL1 cytokines by 40\u201350% upon Pam3CSK4 treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a>), whereas PPP1R11 knockdown significantly increased both IL-6 and CXCL1 cytokine release in MLE cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013G</a>). Cytokine release upon overexpression and knockdown of fellow RING E3 ligase Trim52 resulted in no significant difference relative to controls (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013G</a>). Finally, we embarked on gene editing experiments to confirm the regulatory role of PPP1R11 on TLR2 and cytokine release. Utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we generated a 2 bp deletion in the first exon of <i>Ppp1r11</i> in MLE cells leading to an immediate pre-mature stop codon. Following colony expansion, we assayed protein half-life and observed stabilized TLR2 half-life in the <i>Ppp1r11</i> KO cells relative to control (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We also challenged PPP1R11 KO cells with PAM3CSK4, and observed increased IL-6 and CXCL1 cytokine release relative to control cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013C</a>). From these observations we believe PPP1R11 suppresses TLR2-linked inflammatory signaling."

                        "text": "Pattern recognition receptors play a critical role in mucosal immunity by sensing PAMPs from invading pathogens and initiating cellular responses to eliminate those pathogens. Here we show a novel mechanism by which the previously unrecognized RING finger E3 ligase, PPP1R11, attenuates TLR2 signaling in response to <i>S. aureus</i> infection by targeting TLR2 for proteasomal degradation. PPP1R11 (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 11) was originally described to interact with and inhibit protein phosphatase 1 activity (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhang et al., 1998</a>) . It also has another name, TcTex5 (T-Complex-Associated-Testis-Expressed 5), and it was implied that mutation of TcTex5 is associated with a mouse sperm motility abnormality in sterile t-haplotype mutant mice (<a href=\"#bib20\">Han et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pilder et al., 2007</a>). However, its E3 ligase activity has never been described. Canonical RING finger domains contain the consensus sequence C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>[9-39]</sub>-C-X<sub>[1-3]</sub>-H-X<sub>[2-3]</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>[4-48]</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C, where both cysteine and histidine residues are involved in zinc coordination\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Borden and Freemont, 1996</a>). However, we believe that PPP1R11 has a non-canonical RING finger domain with all the characteristics of a Ring finger E3 ligase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). We show the\u00a0relative specificity of TLR2 targeting by PPP1R11, as none of the other TLRs tested were degraded by PPP1R11 expression (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). However, it is possible that other E3 ligases target TLR2 for ubiquitination as this phenomenon has been well described with other substrates, e.g. SCF E3 ligase subunits Fbxw1, Fbxw7, Fbxw8, Fbxl1, Fbxo4, and Fbxo31 are all capable of ubiquitinating cyclin D1\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib40\">Skaar et al., 2009</a>). We do not rule out other RING finger E3 ligase or even other E3 ligase family members to potentially target TLR2 for ubiquitination, however, our data suggest that PPP1R11 targets TLR2 for proteasomal degradation via ubiquitination."

                        "text": "Targeted TLR2 degradation by PPP1R11 may act as a negative feedback mechanism in the lung to prevent a harmful, excessive inflammatory response that causes severe lung injury. We have observed similar function of other E3 ligase proteins such as Fbxl19 in acute lung injury and pneumonia (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zhao et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, we showed that treatment of MLE cells with TLR2 ligand, Pam3CSK4, up-regulates PPP1R11 protein levels and gradually reduces TLR2 protein levels at about 4\u20136 hr (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We also showed that ectopic expression of PPP1R11 in MLE cells significantly reduced Pam3CSK4-induced cytokine release, and gene editing of PPP1R11 significantly increases ligand-induced cytokine release (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013C</a>). This evidence suggests that PPP1R11 could be a natural inflammatory suppressor in cells, and this pathway could be utilized to target multiple types of stimuli-induced inflammation. While the\u00a0targeted degradation of TLR2 may restrain excessive inflammatory responses, activation of this pathway is also critical for pathogen clearance. By manipulating levels of TLR2 in murine lungs through PPP1R11, we showed effects in downstream inflammation and <i>S. aureus</i> bacterial clearance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). These results are in line with previous studies showing TLR2 deficient mice were more susceptible to <i>S. aureus</i> infection (<a href=\"#bib43\">Takeuchi et al., 2000</a>). Specifically, higher inflammation in the lung might lead to lung injury, but also proved to be more efficient at clearing bacteria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), whereas reduced inflammation in the lung is tissue-protective but fails to clear bacteria, which leads to systemic bacteremia (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). One approach to potentially control the balance between the beneficial effects of the inflammatory pathway and the harmful and excessive responses to pathogens is to manipulate PPP1R11. These results suggest that PPP1R11 inhibition might confer a protective phenotype against <i>S. aureus</i> pneumonia by augmenting TLR2 signaling, which is critical for bacterial clearance. As a proof-of-concept investigation, we observed a negative correlation between TLR2 and PPP1R11 protein levels in WBC pellets from <i>S. aureus</i>-infected patients. Interestingly, no correlation between PPP1R11 and TLR2 levels was observed in control patients (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). This experiment suggests that the PPP1R11/TLR2 pathway is only active during <i>S. aureus</i> infection. It is likely that other regulators such as kinases are also involved in PPP1R11-driven TLR2 ubiquitination, which is common in E3 ligase substrate targeting (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lear et al., 2016</a>). Further studies are warranted to investigate regulators that influence PPP1R11 expression and activity."

Down-regulation of TLR2 levels by PPP1R11 reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion but impairs bacterial clearance in response to <i>S. aureus</i>. Taken together, this study characterizes a novel innate immune regulatory mechanism involving PPP1R11-targeted degradation of the pattern recognition receptor TLR2."

As part of an ongoing Acute Lung Injury Biospecimen Repository, blood was collected from critically ill, mechanically-ventilated patients admitted to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Presbyterian Hospital Medical Intensive Care Unit. Whole blood was treated with red blood cell lysis solution, and leukocytes were washed once with PBS prior to pelleting. Groups were separated into \u2018control\u2019 and \u2018injury\u2019 cohorts based on clinical evidence of or risk factors for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as determined by an expert clinical panel. Control patients were mechanically ventilated without clinical evidence of or risk factors for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), while the injury cohort had clinical evidence of or risk factor for ARDS. For this study, samples were analyzed from a group of randomly selected control cohort patients (without <i>S. aureus</i> infection), as well as from patients with evidence of <i>S. aureus</i> infection (BAL, blood, or both) in the injury cohort. The Biospecimen Repository provided de-identified samples to this laboratory, and cell pellets were assayed for TLR2 and PPP1R11 proteins by immunoblotting, quantified using ImageJ software, and graphed in GraphPad. All data acquisition and densitometry was performed blinded prior to revealing cohort groups."

This work identifies a previously unreported RING finger E3 ligase in TLR2 regulation."

PPP1R11 is up regulated in response to the TLR2 ligand, Pam3CSK4, and subsequently ubiquitinates TLR2 at lysine 754 for degradation, thereby suppressing cytokine production induced by TLR2 signaling pathway. Overexpression or knockdown of PPP1R11 in mouse affects lung inflammation and bacterial clearance in response to staphylococcus aureus infection. Together, they conclude that PPP1R11 targets TLR2 for ubiquitination and degradation in vitro and in vivo, which is involved in the regulation of innate immunity induced by gram-positive bacterial infection. These findings are significant, since they characterize a previously unreported RING finger E3 ligase and suggest a new mechanism of TLR2 regulation. However, the authors should consider the following comments to further strengthen the work."
