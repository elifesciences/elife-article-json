To determine which BCL2 protein or proteins block apoptosis in different cancers, we computationally designed three-helix bundle protein inhibitors specific for each BCL2 pro-survival protein. Following in vitro optimization, each inhibitor binds its target with high picomolar to low nanomolar affinity and at least 300-fold specificity. Expression of the designed inhibitors in human cancer cell lines revealed unique dependencies on BCL2 proteins for survival which could not be inferred from other BCL2 profiling methods. Our results show that designed inhibitors can be generated for each member of a closely-knit protein family to probe the importance of specific protein-protein interactions in complex biological processes."

To determine which BCL2 protein or proteins block apoptosis in different cancers, we computationally designed three-helix bundle protein inhibitors specific for each BCL2 pro-survival protein. Following in vitro optimization, each inhibitor binds its target with high picomolar to low nanomolar affinity and at least 300-fold specificity. Expression of the designed inhibitors in human cancer cell lines revealed unique dependencies on BCL2 proteins for survival which could not be inferred from other BCL2 profiling methods. Our results show that designed inhibitors can be generated for each member of a closely-knit protein family to probe the importance of specific protein-protein interactions in complex biological processes."

As cells enter apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane permeability increases, releasing mitochondrial factors such as cytochrome <i>c</i> that initiate destructive protease cascades in the cytosol. The key regulators of mitochondrial outer membrane permeability are B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) family proteins which are categorized functionally by their effect on cell fate, and structurally by the presence of BCL2 homology (BH) motifs. Pro-apoptotic effector proteins Bak and Bax have four distinct BH motifs and homo-oligomerize upon activation to form pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane, committing the cell to apoptosis. Pro-survival homologs (six in humans: Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, Bfl-1 and Bcl-B) are structurally similar, but oppose apoptosis by binding and inhibiting Bak and Bax, as well as sequestering pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (BOPs). BOPs can also activate effectors directly through transient binding interactions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Walensky et al., 2006</a>) or indirectly by binding pro-survival proteins and out-competing bound effectors (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ku et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Willis et al., 2007</a>) or other direct activator BOPs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kuwana et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Letai et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Interactions between BCL2 members are mediated by an amphipathic, helical BH3 motif that recognizes a conserved hydrophobic cleft present in the effectors and pro-survival proteins. The balanced network of interactions between pro-apoptotic and pro-survival members can be tipped toward cell death by cellular stress signals that induce transcription (<a href=\"#bib12\">Essafi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Nakano and Vousden, 2001</a>) or post-translational modification of BOPs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Desagher et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fricker et al., 2010</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib46\">Shamas-Din et al., 2011</a>)."

Small molecule and peptide therapeutics mimic BOPs by binding pro-survival proteins, inducing apoptosis by disrupting inhibition of Bak and Bax and limiting sequestration of BOPs. However, BH3-mimetics that non-specifically target multiple BCL2 proteins can cause harmful side effects by unnecessarily suppressing normal biological functions. For example, the small molecule ABT-737 (and related ABT-263) targeting Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w exhibits dose-limiting thrombocytopenia in treating Bcl-2-dependent chronic lymphocytic leukemia due to excessive inhibition of Bcl-xL, which has a role in platelet development (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mason et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Roberts et al., 2012</a>)."

However, there are currently no highly specific inhibitors for Bcl-w and Bcl-B, and hence general mechanistic aspects of apoptotic regulation remain unclear. Here we describe the computational design and experimental characterization of specific, high affinity protein inhibitors for all six pro-survival BCL2 homologs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The inhibitors exhibit high specificity in engineered cell lines, and in defined combinations they induce apoptosis in representative cancer cell lines. This comprehensive set of molecular probes should be useful to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, determine BCL2 profiles of individual cancers, and provide a superior guide for tailored therapies."

The three helix bundle protein, called BINDI, is complementary to the canonical BH3-binding groove of BHRF1. BINDI consists of a central BH3-like motif and two additional helices that both stabilize the BH3-motif and provide extra contacts for high affinity and specific binding (PDB 4OYD; <a href=\"#bib41\">Procko et al., 2014</a>). Pro-survival BCL2 homologs share similar sequences (40\u201360% similarity between any two) and structures (approximately 3 \u00c5 RMSD), and hence achieving specific binding for each one is a challenging problem. We hypothesized that the expanded binding interface of the BINDI scaffold could enable design of specificity by contacting regions where BCL2 homolog sequences differ both within and outside of the conserved BH3 binding cleft (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

Mutations that enhance the affinity of M-CDP02 for BCL2 members other than Mcl-1 include prolines in the first and third helical segments, substitutions of apolar to polar amino acids in the hydrophobic core, and premature stop codons in the third helix. These mutations likely cause unfolding of the helix bundle and expose the Bim-BH3-like motif in the second helix, thus converting a protein that binds Mcl-1 with high affinity and partial specificity to a pan-specific high-affinity binder similar to the Bim-BH3 motif (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Thus, in lieu of generating a combinatorial library, single amino acid mutants were screened with BLI, and three mutations improving both specificity and affinity were combined in \u03b1BCL2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>)."

Each CDP and optimized inhibitor was docked into the canonical binding groove of each BCL2 homolog, and thousands of docked configurations were sampled both locally (low RMSD to input configuration) and globally (entire protein surface). Overall, both the partially-specific CDPs and optimized, specific inhibitors exhibit more favorable absolute binding energy (local minimum ddG) and relative binding energy (local minimum versus global minimum ddG) when docked to on-target homologs compared to off-target homologs. These calculations resemble trends in the experimental binding data, but they do not discriminate between the highly specific, optimized inhibitors and partially specific precursors. Thus, while adding computational docking or multi-state design to computationally select against off-target homologs to our design protocol may improve the initial success rate of achieving high affinity and at least partially specific binding, the resolution of these calculations limits discrimination between variants with low versus high specificity."

A representative cancer cell line (HeLa) was engineered to overexpress Mcl-1, Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, and we assayed the activity of the designed inhibitors in each setting (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Previous studies revealed that HeLa cells are resistant to the expression of Noxa (which targets Mcl-1 and Bfl-1) and ABT-737 (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) independently, but are potently killed with the combination of Noxa with ABT-737 (<a href=\"#bib51\">van Delft et al., 2006</a>). Likewise, single designed inhibitors had little effect on survival. More substantial cell death was induced by combinations of \u03b1MCL1 with \u03b1BCL2 (29 \u00b1 9% survival) and \u03b1MCL1 with \u03b1BCLXL (38 \u00b1 17%) than \u03b1BCL2 with \u03b1BCLXL (75 \u00b1 7%). These data, and similar results in Mcl-1-overexpressing (Mcl-1+) HeLa cells, suggest that Mcl-1 plays a more crucial role in wild-type HeLa survival than Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL."

Thus, increased expression of a given BCL2 protein can compensate for the inhibition of others. The triple combination of \u03b1MCL1, \u03b1BCL2, and \u03b1BCLXL had greater efficacy than double combinations, indicating a contribution of each pro-survival protein to basal survival. Bcl-xL+ cells were generally more resistant than all other cell lines; the inability to completely inhibit Bcl-xL\u2019s survival function in Bcl-xL+ cells suggests that in this context, Bcl-xL may interact with proteins that are not displaced efficiently by \u03b1BCLXL."

In wild-type HeLa cells, Bim associated primarily with Mcl-1. Introduction of \u03b1MCL1 resulted in displacement of Bim from Mcl-1, with modest compensatory sequestration of Bim by Bcl-2. In Bcl-2+ cells, Bim is redistributed and preferentially binds Bcl-2 rather than Mcl-1, likely due to the stoichiometric excess of Bcl-2, and \u03b1MCL1 has no effect. The cell-killing activity of \u03b1MCL1 with \u03b1BCL2 in wild-type, Mcl-1+ and Bcl-2+ cells is consistent with these data; inhibition of both Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in these settings likely overwhelms BOP sequestration, and a higher proportion of Bim and other activator BOPs may be free to interact with Bak and Bax, inducing apoptosis."

To determine whether the\u00a0Mcl-1 antagonism could render colon cancers sensitive to Bcl-xL neutralization and assess the influence of other pro-survival homologs on survival, we modified a panel of seven colon cancer lines to inducibly express either \u03b1MCL1 or \u03b1BFL1, and treated them with small molecules to selectively inhibit Bcl-2 (ABT-199), Bcl-xL (A-1331852), or Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL simultaneously (ABT-263)."

Combined inhibition of both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL caused nearly complete cell death after 24 hr in all colon cancers except HCT-116; further analyses showed that \u03b1MCL1-mediated Mcl-1 inhibition strongly sensitizes most colon cancers to A-1331852 (and to a lesser extent ABT-263), with a 4.6-fold or greater decrease in EC<sub>50</sub> values observed in all cell lines except HCT-116 (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). All other combinations had much smaller effects. Thus, in contrast to gliobastoma where pro-survival proteins appeared largely redundant, inhibition of two pro-survival proteins was required and sufficient for cell killing. These results suggest that in context of colon cancer, pro-survival proteins may resist apoptosis primarily via 'mode 2' inhibition of the direct effector Bak, which interacts preferentially with Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL (<a href=\"#bib31\">Llambi et al., 2011</a>). As \u03b1MCL1 targets Mcl-1 in a manner more akin to a drug (i.e. antagonism) compared to RNAi, our data provide further evidence that treatment strategies involving Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL inhibition could be effective in these malignancies."

Our designed inhibitors exhibit greater specificity and in many cases higher affinity than small molecule alternatives, and have advantages unique to their protein composition. For example, the designed proteins can be easily modified for added functionality, such as adding a mitochondrial targeting sequence, or fusing an E3 ligase to each design to catalyze degradation of their target BCL2 proteins. The designed protein inhibitors can be genetically encoded, enabling spatial and temporal control of expression, and have distinct advantages over broadly eliminating the target BCL2 protein using CRISPR- or RNAi-mediated knockdown or knockout. The designs can be used to probe mechanism; we show that specific inhibitors cause the redistribution of a representative BOP, Bim, and the approach can be used to probe other BOPs and compare 'mode 1' versus 'mode 2' inhibition of apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Llambi et al., 2011</a>). Some BCL2 proteins translocate from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane in response to apoptotic stimuli, and the effect of inhibition in these different compartments can be probed by localizing the designed inhibitors with the appropriate targeting sequences and inducing expression before and after apoptotic stimuli. The designed proteins can also be used to distinguish interactions at sites other than the BH3-binding groove; for example, Bcl-xL is thought to interact with p53 at a site opposite the BH3-binding groove (<a href=\"#bib37\">Petros et al., 2004</a>), and Bcl-2 is reported to interact with the IP3 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum via Bcl-2\u2019s BH4-domain (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rong et al., 2009</a>). These studies are simply impossible with CRISPR or RNAi strategies."

Our success in designing not one but six specific inhibitors demonstrates the generality of the design method. We are not aware of any precedent among designed proteins or indeed in nature for two sets of six closely related proteins in which each protein in one set has the extremely high specificity (100\u2013100,000 fold) for a unique member of the other set."

The designs were used to determine the BCL2-dependence of different cancers, providing a more direct guide for therapy than knockdown/knockout strategies or mRNA analysis by mimicking the mechanism of action of BCL2-targeting small molecule drugs. While mRNA profiling suggests that Bfl-1 confers apoptotic resistance in SK-MEL-5 and LOX-IMVI melanomas (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hind et al., 2015</a>), our combinatorial antagonism of pro-survival homologs indicates that Mcl-1 plays a more critical role and further discriminates between sensitive LOX-IMVI and resistant SK-MEL-5. We also provide further evidence that many colon cancers are dependent on Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL for survival; mRNA profiling indicates Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL are indeed more prevalent than other BCL2 homologs in many colon cancers, but resistant HCT-116 is indistinguishable from sensitive lines like Caco-2 and HT-29 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Placzek et al., 2010</a>). Further, the detection of RKO sensitivity to Bfl-1 inhibition highlights the capacity of the designed inhibitors to illuminate unique\u00a0BCL2 profiles, even among cancers with similar general characteristics."

Competing approaches offer less control. The distribution of small molecules is difficult to spatially or temporally control in vivo, and broadly eliminating the protein of interest with CRISPR or RNAi cannot probe interactions with a specific interface or capture mechanistic intricacies. This work demonstrates that high affinity and specificity protein inhibitors can be designed for each member of a closely-knit protein family, providing a unique opportunity to probe the importance of individual protein interactions."

If the target structure was bound to an unnatural ligand, such as a small molecule or \u03b1/\u03b2-foldamer, the model of the pro-survival homolog was first aligned to an alternative structure bound to a helical BH3 motif, which then served as a guide for structural alignment of BINDI. The structural alignment was visually inspected, and any docked configurations with backbone clashes between the scaffold protein and BCL2 homolog were discarded. Side chain clashes were tolerated, as they may be resolved later by sequence design of the scaffold and by rotamer repacking on the target. Important interfacial residues from each BH3-motif were transferred, or grafted, to the aligned BINDI scaffold and kept fixed during the subsequent design protocol; these \u2018hotspot\u2019 residues per model are listed in <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>.

The motif is then grafted (i.e. embedded) into a larger protein scaffold, which both stabilizes the structure of the small motif and contributes additional favorable interactions with the target protein. We have implemented a new computational grafting protocol as the MotifGraft mover in RosettaScripts, described in detail by <a href=\"#bib47\">Silva et al. (2016)</a>. The input of MotifGraft is composed of three structures: (1) the motif, which is a protein fragment that is intended for grafting in a new protein scaffold; (2) the context, which is the macromolecule interacting with the motif; and (3) the target scaffolds, which are protein scaffolds that the protocol will use to search insertion points for the motif. The goal of MotifGraft is to find fragments in the target scaffolds that are geometrically compatible with the specified motif(s), and then replace those fragments with the motif(s) itself. In this case, the parameters of grafting were settled to perform full backbone alignment of the input motif, with a maximum RMSD of the backbone of 3.0 \u00c5 and RMSD for the endpoints of 2.0 \u00c5. For the input motif \u2018truncatedBH3.pdb\u2019 the hotspot residues were defined as: LEU-9, ILE-12, GLY-13, ASP-14, PHE-16 and ASN-17. The protocol was instructed to revert all other residues to their native identities in the target scaffold. No clashes between the grafted design and the context protein were allowed. The following mover was added to the XML script to implement this protocol within the RosettaScripts framework:"

The diversity of all combinatorial libraries was limited to less than 10<sup>7</sup> variants. GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used to introduce up to three random mutations in F-ECM04 and B-ECM01 genes. DNA libraries comprising genes for the initial designed protein sequence and related variants were cloned into the pETCON plasmid (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fleishman et al., 2011b</a>), transformed into yeast, and expressed as fusions with N-terminal Aga2p for surface display and a C-terminal myc-tag in the EBY100 strain (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chao et al., 2006</a>). Yeast libraries were grown in minimal media selective for the yeast strain (-ura) and the transforming plasmid (-trp), and protein expression was induced with 2% galactose. Surface expression was detected with anti-myc-FITC (Immunology Consultants Laboratory,\u00a0Portland,\u00a0OR), and binding to biotinylated Bcl-2 proteins after co-incubation for 0.5\u20132 hr at 22\u00b0C was detected with phycoerythrin-streptavidin (Invitrogen,\u00a0Calsbad,\u00a0CA).

This work serves as a good example of how computational design can be used with experimental screening and selection to engineer specific binders against individual members from a family of proteins that share high sequence and structure similarity. The target proteins, pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins, have been the subject of numerous previous studies aimed at designing peptide and small molecule inhibitors. This study presents specific inhibitors for all six homologs and shows how the panel of inhibitors can be used to probe cross-talk and redundancy between BCL-family proteins in human cancer cell lines. The set of probes generated by this work will be very useful for future studies aimed at profiling the roles of BCl-2 family proteins in disease, especially cancers."

Overall, both the partially-specific computational designs and very specific optimized inhibitors exhibit more favorable absolute binding energy (minimum ddG of local docking trajectories) and relative binding energy (minimum ddG of local docking compared to minimum of global docking) when docked to on-target homologs compared to off-target homologs. These calculations resemble trends in the experimental binding data, but they do not discriminate between the highly specific, optimized inhibitors and partially specific precursors. Thus, while additions to the design protocol such as computational docking or multi-state design against off-target homologs may improve the initial success rate of achieving high affinity and at least partially specific binding, the resolution of these calculations limits discrimination between variants with low versus high specificity. These data and accompanying explanation have been added to the manuscript."
