                    "text": "Complexins play activating and inhibitory functions in neurotransmitter release. The complexin accessory helix inhibits release and was proposed to insert into SNARE complexes to prevent their full assembly. This model was supported by \u2018superclamp\u2019 and \u2018poor-clamp\u2019 mutations that enhanced or decreased the complexin-I inhibitory activity in cell\u2013cell fusion assays, and by the crystal structure of a superclamp mutant bound to a synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complex. NMR studies now show that the complexin-I accessory helix does not insert into synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complexes in solution, and electrophysiological data reveal that superclamp mutants have slightly stimulatory or no effects on neurotransmitter release, whereas a poor-clamp mutant inhibits release. Importantly, increasing or decreasing the negative charge of the complexin-I accessory helix inhibits or stimulates release, respectively. These results suggest a new model whereby the complexin accessory helix inhibits release through electrostatic (and perhaps steric) repulsion enabled by its location between the vesicle and plasma membranes."

The complexin accessory helix inhibits release and was proposed to insert into SNARE complexes to prevent their full assembly. This model was supported by \u2018superclamp\u2019 and \u2018poor-clamp\u2019 mutations that enhanced or decreased the complexin-I inhibitory activity in cell\u2013cell fusion assays, and by the crystal structure of a superclamp mutant bound to a synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complex. NMR studies now show that the complexin-I accessory helix does not insert into synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complexes in solution, and electrophysiological data reveal that superclamp mutants have slightly stimulatory or no effects on neurotransmitter release, whereas a poor-clamp mutant inhibits release. Importantly, increasing or decreasing the negative charge of the complexin-I accessory helix inhibits or stimulates release, respectively. These results suggest a new model whereby the complexin accessory helix inhibits release through electrostatic (and perhaps steric) repulsion enabled by its location between the vesicle and plasma membranes."

To release these neurotransmitters into the synapse, the membrane that encloses the vesicle fuses with the membrane that surrounds the neuron. To fuse the membranes, proteins embedded in the vesicle membrane interact with similar proteins in the neuron membrane to form a structure called a SNARE complex. Additional proteins control membrane fusion to ensure that the signal is passed to the other neuron at the right time and with the appropriate efficiency."

Although different parts of complexins can both help and hinder membrane fusion, a part known as an accessory helix is thought to have only one role\u2014to stop the membranes from fusing together. Several models have been suggested for how the accessory helix interferes with fusion. However, after performing a range of analyses by diverse biophysical techniques, Trimbuch, Xu et al. suggest these models are unlikely to describe the process accurately."

An accessory helix taken from a fruit fly complexin was more negatively charged than a mammalian version, and experiments showed it was also better at preventing the release of neurotransmitters. It is thought that the negative charges on the helix hold the membranes apart because the helix is located between the membranes, which are also negatively charged. Consistent with this model, Trimbuch, Xu et al. showed that the membranes fused more easily when some of the negative charges on the accessory helix were replaced with positive charges. The next challenges are to test the model further with additional studies, and to explain how other proteins work with complexins to control neurotransmitter release."

The activating function has been proposed to arise from stabilization of the SNARE complex by complexin binding (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2002</a>), from interactions of the complexin N-terminus with the C-terminus of the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xue et al., 2010</a>), and from binding of the complexin C-terminal region to phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib46\">Seiler et al., 2009</a>), but these models remain to be validated. The inhibitory activity of complexins attracted much attention because several studies suggested that complexins prevent exocytosis before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and synaptotagmin-1 releases the inhibition upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding by displacing complexins from the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib15\">Giraudo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schaub et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Roggero et al., 2007</a>). Later analyses showed that CpxI is not fully displaced but there is competition between synaptotagmin-1 and part of CpxI for binding to the SNARE complex on membranes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Xu et al., 2013</a>). Genetic interaction studies in hippocampal neurons showed that complexins regulate release similarly in the absence or presence of synaptotagmin-1, indicating that complexins function independently of synaptotagmin-1 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Xue et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2010</a>), but this finding does not exclude the notion that complexins and synaptotagmin-1 may cooperate in regulating release. For example, the dramatic increase of spontaneous release observed in complexin nulls in <i>Drosophila</i> requires synaptotagmin-1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jorquera et al., 2012</a>), and absence of complexins in hippocampal neurons sensitizes release to loss of 50% of synaptotagmin-1 expression (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xue et al., 2010</a>)."

We initially proposed that part of this helix might replace part of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif in trans partially assembled SNARE complexes, hindering C-terminal assembly of the complex (<a href=\"#bib57\">Xue et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). A similar insertion model, but envisioning that the entire accessory helix replaces part of synaptobrevin, was proposed later and was supported by the enhanced inhibition in cell\u2013cell fusion assays caused by replacing charged with hydrophobic residues in the accessory helix of CpxI ('superclamp mutants') and by the design of a \u2018poor-clamp\u2019 mutation (K26A) that impairs the inhibitory activity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Giraudo et al., 2009</a>). The crystal structure of a fragment of a CpxI superclamp mutant (D27L, E34F, R37A) bound to a SNARE complex with C-terminally truncated synaptobrevin suggested an alternative model whereby the central helix of one CpxI molecule binds to a SNARE complex and the accessory helix inserts into another SNARE complex, resulting in a zigzag array (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kummel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

Using NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we show that the accessory helix of CpxI does not insert into synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complexes in solution. Furthermore, in stark contrast with the cell\u2013cell fusion data, rescue experiments in complexin I-III triple knockout (KO) neurons reveal that superclamp mutations in CpxI lead to slightly stimulatory or no effects on neurotransmitter release, while the poor-clamp K26A mutation impairs release. We also find that the accessory helix of complexin from <i>drosophila melanogaster</i> inhibits spontaneous release more strongly than the accessory helix of mammalian CpxI, which may arise from the more negatively charged nature of the former. Indeed, a mutation that increases the negative charge of the CpxI accessory helix inhibits release and a mutation that decreases the negative charge enhances release. These results suggest a model whereby the location of the negatively charged accessory helix between the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes causes electrostatic and perhaps steric repulsion with the membranes, thus hindering membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

Comparison with the spectrum obtained in the presence of non-truncated SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) showed that the well-resolved cross-peaks from several residues of the central helix (e.g., those of E58, E60, M62, R63 and Q64) moved gradually to the center of the spectrum, toward their positions in free CpxI(26-83), as the truncation was more severe. Moreover, some of these cross-peaks exhibited broadening that most likely arises from chemical exchange. In contrast, cross-peaks from more C-terminal residues of the central helix (e.g., those of I66, D68 and K69) were less affected by the truncations. This behavior is illustrated by the chemical shift changes observed in the CpxI(26-83) central helix when comparing SC-bound vs SC\u039468-bound spectra [\u0394\u03b4Cpx(SC\u039468-SC)], normalized by the changes observed between free and SC-bound Cpx(26-83) [\u0394\u03b4Cpx(SC-free)] (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Instead, these data indicate that there is exchange between the normal bound state with a stable central helix and one or more states where the C-terminus of the central helix is stably packed against the SNAREs but the N-terminus of the central helix is flexible. These states become more populated for the \u039462 truncation than for \u039468. The effect of the \u039468 truncation can be attributed to an overall destabilization of the synaptobrevin helix beyond R56, the residue in the central polar layer of the SNARE complex that provides an approximate point of separation for two folding units corresponding to the N- and C-terminal halves of the complex (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sorensen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gao et al., 2012</a>). This destabilization is manifested in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of the truncated SNARE complex described below and is transferred to the CpxI central helix, which is not surprising because the central helix makes extensive contacts with synaptobrevin residues spanning from R47 to A69 in the non-truncated complex (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The stronger effects on the cross-peaks of the CpxI central helix caused by the \u039462 truncation, compared to \u039468, arise naturally from the removal of key synaptobrevin residues that interact with CpxI, including D64, D65 and D68."

The truncations did cause some changes in the center of the spectrum, but the number of cross-peaks and their overall distribution remained similar (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Cross-peaks from the accessory helix that could be identified in all the spectra exhibited some shifts in the different complexes, but in all cases they remained close to the position of the cross-peak corresponding to free CpxI(26-83) (illustrated by the A30 and Q38 cross-peaks in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). Note that these shifts can be induced by changes in the stability of the helix in the different complexes and that insertion of the accessory helix into the truncated SNARE complexes is expected to induce much more dramatic shifts. Moreover, such insertion should cause strong broadening in the cross-peaks from the accessory helix, but the intensities of these cross-peaks actually increased in the spectrum of Cpx(26-83) bound to SC\u039468 with respect to the SC-bound state, and increased somewhat more in the SC\u039462-bound spectrum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1C,D</a>). These data show that the synaptobrevin C-terminal truncations increase the flexibility of the accessory helix, in correlation with the destabilization of N-terminal part of the central helix, and provide very strong evidence against the notion that the accessory helix of CpxI(26-83) inserts into the grove generated by the truncations."

The spectra was similar to that obtained with SC\u039462, but most cross-peaks from the central helix were broadened beyond detection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). This behavior can be attributed to stronger chemical exchange broadening, which is particularly well manifested for the cross-peaks of K73 and K75 (which are adjacent to the central helix). The well-resolved cross-peaks from the accessory helix of CpxI(26-83) bound to SC\u039460 (e.g., those of A30 and Q38) had similar intensities as those observed upon binding to SC\u039462, showing that the accessory helix does not insert into the groove left by the \u039460 truncation. Because the zigzag array observed in the crystal structure of the CpxI(26-83) superclamp/SC\u039460 complex suggested that the accessory helix should be able to bind by itself to SC\u039460, without the central helix, we also acquired <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of a WT <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-CpxI fragment spanning the accessory helix [CpxI(26-48)]. SC\u039460 did not cause substantial changes in the spectra of CpxI(26-48) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Because of the very high sensitivity of these spectra to binding to protein complexes such as SC\u039460, particularly for flexible peptides such as CpxI(26-48), even a small percentage of binding should be reflected in some cross-peak broadening.

Moreover, these small shifts can arise from stabilization of the synaptobrevin and syntaxin-1 helix in the truncated SNARE complex upon binding to CpxI(26-83). Importantly, CpxI(26-83) binding induced practically no changes in the cross-peaks corresponding to the flexible C-terminus of SNC in the \u039462 SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), showing again that the CpxI accessory helix does not interact with the truncated SNARE complex. We also analyzed perturbations caused by the Cpx(26-83)supcl mutant or a fragment spanning the accessory and central helices of CpxI from <i>Drosophila Melanogaster</i> [dmCpx(28-88)], which inhibits release more strongly than mammalian CpxI (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Xue et al., 2009</a>), but the results (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) were analogous to those obtained with WT CpxI(26-83).

All these results suggest that the accessory helix of WT CpxI(26-83), Cpx(26-83)supcl and dmCpx(28-88) do not insert into the SNARE complexes containing C-terminally truncated synaptobrevin.

These results correlated with those obtained with <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-SNC-SC\u039462 and indicate that the C-terminal half of the syntaxin-1 SNARE motif becomes flexible due to the \u039462 synaptobrevin truncation, although the smaller number of cross-peaks in the middle suggests that there may be broadening due to exchange between structured and flexible conformations.

In these assays, 1.5 equivalents of CpxI lacking the accessory helix [CpxI(47-134)] were used to block the central helix binding site of SC\u039460, and the heat observed on addition of CpxI(26-83) was attributed to binding of the accessory helix of CpxI(26-83) to SC\u039460. This interpretation assumed that 1.5 equivalents for CpxI(47-134) were sufficient to quantitatively saturate SC\u039460, but the validity of this assumption is unclear because removal of multiple synaptobrevin residues that interact with CpxI in the non-truncated SNARE complex is expected to considerably decrease the affinity of SC\u039460 for CpxI."

For the latter (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), we measured a K<sub>d</sub> of 339 \u00b1 9 nM (\u0394H = \u221232.6 kcal/mol; N = 0.95), which is higher than that we obtained for CpxI(26-83) [K<sub>d</sub> = 25.3 nM; <a href=\"#bib53\">Xu et al., 2013</a>] and may arise because of favorable long-range electrostatic interactions between the accessory helix and the SNARE complex. Importantly, binding of Cpx(47-134) to SC\u039460 was even weaker, with a K<sub>d</sub> of 2.39 \u00b1 0.19 \u03bcM (\u0394H = \u221219.5 kcal/mol; N = 0.92) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This decreased affinity implies that binding of CpxI(47-134) to SC\u039460 is not saturated upon addition of 1.5 equivalents of CpxI(47-134) (arrow in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Hence, the heat observed upon addition of CpxI(26-83) to SC\u039460 blocked with CpxI(27-134) arises from completion of the titration of the central helix binding site, rather than from interactions involving the accessory helix. We confirmed this conclusion by titrating CpxI(47-134) itself on a sample containing SC\u039460 and 1.5 equivalents of CpxI(47-134) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), which logically yielded data similar to those observed in the direct titration experiment of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> beyond 1.5 equivalents. Moreover, adding CpxI(26-83) to SC\u039460 prebound to 1.5 equivalents of CpxI(47-134) yielded very similar results (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), which in turn were also comparable to the data described in <a href=\"#bib27\">Kummel et al. (2011)</a>. To test for binding of the accessory helix under conditions where the central helix binding site was more saturated, we performed experiments with SC\u039460 prebound to 3.0 equivalents of CpxI(47-134) (93% binding based on the K<sub>d</sub> described above). As expected, addition of Cpx(26-83) yielded only a small amount of heat that again is the natural extension of the direct titration of the central helix binding site (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Hence, no binding of the accessory helix of Cpx(26-83) to SC\u039460 is detected in these experiments."

Comparison of the spectra obtained for free <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb and <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb-SC showed again the dramatic spectral changes that occur when a flexible sequence such as <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb forms a stable complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; cross-peak assignments for <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb based on those of Syb[1-96] [<a href=\"#bib18\">Hazzard et al., 1999</a>] are shown in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The truncation of the syntaxin-1 C-terminus in <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb-SC\u0394236 led to disappearance of most well-dispersed cross-peaks from the C-terminal half of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif and appearance of new, sharp cross-peaks in the middle of the spectrum (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We obtained assignments for some of these cross-peaks using triple resonance experiments as described (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2002</a>) and found that they generally were at similar positions to those observed for free <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb (e.g., for A67, A69, A72, A74, W89 and K91; compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, orange contours, with <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These results suggest that the C-terminal half of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif is flexible in <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb-SC\u0394236 as a result of the syntaxin-1 truncation.

For non-truncated complex (<sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb-SC), CpxI(26-83) caused multiple cross-peak shifts, particularly for synaptobrevin residues that contact the CpxI central helix (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), as observed previously (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2002</a>). Binding to CpxI(26-83) induced similar shifts for those residues in <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb-SC\u0394236, but in addition caused disappearance of many sharp cross-peaks in the middle of the spectrum that correspond to the flexible synaptobrevin C-terminal half (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). As a result, the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY HSQC spectrum of <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb-SC\u0394236 bound to CpxI(26-83) is similar to that obtained for the non-truncated SNARE complex except that most cross-peaks corresponding to the synaptobrevin C-terminal half disappeared (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Such disappearance most likely arises from chemical exchange between the flexible conformations characteristic of the synaptobrevin C-terminal half in <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb-SC\u0394236 and a more defined structure(s) induced upon CpxI(26-83) binding. These results contrast with those obtained upon addition of CpxI(26-83) to <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-SNC-SC\u0394236 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), which revealed only small cross-peak shifts for a few well-dispersed cross-peaks and no marked changes for the sharp cross-peaks in the middle of the spectrum, as observed for the synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complex <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-SNC-SC\u039462 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

To test this possibility, we analyzed the effects of SC\u0394236 and other SNARE complexes with stronger truncations in the syntaxin-1 C-terminus (SC\u0394232 and SC\u0394228) on the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectrum of <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-labeled CpxI(26-83).

When we included the spectra obtained in the presence of SC\u0394232 and SC\u0394228 in the comparison, it became clear that a few well-resolved cross-peaks (e.g., those of E60, M62, R63, and Q64) shift gradually to the center of the spectrum, toward their positions in free <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-CpxI(26-83), as the truncation in syntaxin-1 is more severe (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This result is similar to that caused by truncations in the synaptobrevin C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and can thus be attributed to increasing destabilization of the CpxI central helix as more residues are deleted in syntaxin-1 (the effects are smaller because most of the residues deleted in syntaxin-1 do not contact CpxI[26-83]; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

These results strongly suggest that the shifts in the CpxI(26-83) accessory helix do not arise from interactions with the C-terminal half of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif but rather because the destabilization of the central helix caused by the truncations in syntaxin-1 is transferred into destabilization of the accessory helix. Note also that no substantial broadening of the cross-peaks from the accessory helix was observed, in contrast to the broadening beyond disappearance of cross-peaks from the synaptobrevin C-terminal half in <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb-SC\u0394236 bound to CpxI(26-83) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). It is likely that such disappearance arises from chemical exchange between the flexible conformations of the synaptobrevin C-terminal half in free <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb-SC\u0394236 and formation of a defined helical structure that does not contact CpxI(26-83) but is nucleated by stabilization of the middle of synaptobrevin upon binding of the CpxI(26-83) central helix. Regardless of the validity of this explanation, it is clear from the behavior of the cross-peaks of the accessory helix that this helix does not interact with the synaptobrevin SNARE motif of the syntaxin-1 truncated SNARE complexes, arguing against the model of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>."

As the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) measured by hypertonic solution (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</a>) was unchanged, the calculated Pvr was also slightly increased in the rescue with the superclamp CpxI mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). The facilitatory synaptic short-term plasticity behavior in complexin I-III triple KO neurons, measured through five EPSCs at 50 Hz and also reflected by calculation of the PPR (EPSC2/EPSC1), could be reversed to a more depressing phenotype in CpxI D27L, E34F, R37A expressing KO neurons compared to the rescue with WT CpxI (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Similarly, depression of EPSC amplitudes during a train of 50 evoked action potentials (AP) at 10 Hz was slightly stronger, and the spontaneous release of vesicles tended to be higher for the super-clamp mutant than for the WT rescue neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>).

To verify this conclusion, we generated a chimeric complexin with most of the sequence corresponding to murine CpxI but with the accessory helix of dmCpx (dmAcc-CpxI; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), and analyzed its influence on neurotransmitter release in complexin triple KO neurons. No significant differences in evoked EPSC amplitudes, RRP charge and Pvr were observed between neurons expressing the dmAcc-CpxI chimera or WT CpxI (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013D</a>). The PPR analyzed from trains of five EPSCs at 50 Hz also showed no difference between chimeric and WT rescue (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). At longer stimulations, the short-term plasticity characteristics at 10 Hz revealed a slight, but not significant, decrease in depression when the chimeric dmAcc-CpxI was expressed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Interestingly however, we did observe a significant, ca. 30% reduction in the frequency of spontaneous release in KO neurons expressing dmAcc-CpxI compared to KO neurons expressing WT CpxI, while the amplitudes of the miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were not different (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>).

These observations and the crystal structure of the CpxI(26-83)/SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) lead naturally to a simple model whereby the complexin accessory helix inhibits release because it is oriented toward the area where the two membranes need to be brought together for fusion and this action is hindered by electrostatic repulsion between the accessory helix and the two membranes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

Lenti-viral expression of the positively charged CpxI-3R and WT CpxI in complexin I-III triple KO neurons did not reveal significant differences in EPSC amplitudes, but rescue with the negatively charged CpxI-5E mutant yielded slightly reduced EPSC amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). The RRP sizes in the four different groups analyzed were not significantly different (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Calculation of the Pvr showed similar release probabilities, with a tendency in the CpxI-3R mutant towards higher release probability, and a tendency in the CpxI-5E mutant towards lower probability (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). Consistent with the Pvr results, trains of five EPSCs at 50 Hz showed that the facilitatory synaptic short-term plasticity characteristic of the complexin I-III triple KO could be rescued in the CpxI-3R expressing neurons to the same level as the WT CpxI expressing neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). However, expressing the negatively charged CpxI-5E protein did not rescue this KO phenotype to the same extent, and the PPR in CpxI-5E expressing neurons was significantly increased compared to WT CpxI expressing neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). These rescue behaviors of the different charged versions of CpxI were also observed when analyzing the short-term plasticity characteristics from trains of 50 EPSCs at 10 Hz. In this case, CpxI-3R expressing neurons showed a slight increase in depression whereas CpxI-5E expressing KO neurons did not depress to the same extent as WT CpxI expressing neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). Importantly, complexin I-III KO neurons expressing the positively charged CpxI-3R exhibited a considerable increase in mEPSC frequency, whereas expression of the negatively charged CpxI-5E resulted in a significant decrease in mEPSC frequency compared to the WT CpxI expressing KO neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>).

To examine whether changing charged residues in the accessory helix of CpxI affects fusogenicity, we compared the responses to 250 mM sucrose in complexin I-III KO neurons expressing WT CpxI, CpxI-3R or CpxI-5E. Compared to WT CpxI expressing neurons, expression of the less negatively charged mutant, CpxI-3R, led to clear increases in the fraction of the RRP released by 250 mM sucrose and the peak release rate, as well as a decrease in the response onset latency (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013C</a>). Conversely, introduction of negatively charged residues in the CpxI-5E mutant led to responses to 250 mM sucrose that resembled those of KO neurons, with reduced fractions of RRP release and peak release rates, and increased response onset latencies (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013C</a>). These data exhibit some correlation with the Pvr (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>) but correlate best with the results from spontaneous release (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figures 9G, 10C</a>), suggesting that the charge of the accessory helix has a larger influence on the ability of synaptic vesicles to fuse in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> than upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.

In the study presented here, we were unable to detect any interaction between C-terminally-truncated SNARE complexes and the accessory helix of WT CpxI or the CpxI superclamp mutant using highly sensitive biophysical methods in solution. Moreover, we find that the effects of superclamp and poor-clamp CpxI mutations on neurotransmitter release do not correlate with their effects on cell\u2013cell fusion assays, actually pointing in opposite directions. We also show that mutations that increase the negative charge of the accessory helix inhibit neurotransmitter release while mutations that increase its positive charge enhance release. These results strongly argue against the insertion and zigzag models for the inhibitory activity of the complexin accessory helix and suggest a simple, alternative model whereby the negative charges of the accessory helix and perhaps steric hindrance repel both membranes, thus hindering membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release."

However, the model envisioned that the three charged side chains replaced in the superclamp mutant (D27, E34, and R37) insert into the hydrophobic groove left in the SNARE complex, which is very unlikely from a thermodynamic point of view. Moreover, our data show that the effects of these mutations on cell\u2013cell fusion do not correlate with their effects on neurotransmitter release: the superclamp D27L, E34F, R37A mutation that enhanced inhibition of cell\u2013cell fusion had little effect on release, with a slight tendency to stimulate release, while the K26A mutation that diminishes the inhibitory acitivity of CpxI in cell\u2013cell fusion actually impairs release (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

However, these rescue experiments revealed no effect of the D27L, E34F, R37A mutation on evoked release, and it was unclear whether a modest inhibitory effect on spontaneous release was significant.

However, the binding mode observed for the mutant accessory helix is highly unlikely thermodynamically for WT CpxI for the above mentioned reason that three mutated side chains are charged and hence are unlikely to insert into a hydrophobic groove. Correspondingly, our extensive NMR analyses did not detect any interaction between the WT CpxI accessory helix and synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complexes in solution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2, 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We were also unable to detect any interaction in solution between truncated SNARE complexes and the accessory helix even for CpxI superclamp mutant fragments (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). A plausible explanation for these findings is that the interaction between the superclamp accessory helix and the truncated SNARE complex observed in the crystals is very weak in solution, and hence could not be observed in our assays, but is stabilized by crystallization. Note that, although the interface area with the SNAREs is larger for the accessory helix (ca. 900 \u0102<sup>2</sup> calculated with PISA; <a href=\"#bib26\">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</a>) than for the central helix (ca. 540 \u0102<sup>2</sup>), the atomic B-factors of the residues of the accessory helix in the interface with the SNAREs are much larger than those in the central helix interface, with little electronic density for the side chains of the accessory helix interface (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Interestingly, it has been suggested that motion at a crystal packing interface is intermediate between that of a solvent accessible surface and that of a protein core, even for large interfaces (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carugo and Argos, 1997</a>). It is also worth noting that <a href=\"#bib27\">Kummel et al.

We believe that the interpretation of the FRET measurements in terms of static structures constitutes an oversimplification because multiple evidence suggests that there is some flexibility in the accessory helix even in the non-truncated complex, including the poor dispersion of the NH cross-peaks of the accessory helix, their sharper line widths compared to cross-peaks of the central helix, the fact that the NH and C\u03b1 chemical shifts of the accessory helix change much less than those of the central helix upon SNARE complex binding and the high B factors observed in the crystal structure of the complex (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2002</a>). Indeed, such flexibility is also consistent with the distance of 20 \u00c5 measured by FRET with probes placed at residue 38 of CpxI and residue 193 of SNAP-25 of the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kummel et al., 2011</a>), since the probes would be expected to be much closer according to the structure of the complex (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2002</a>) (the closest distance between the side chains of these residues is 10 \u00c5). Moreover, our NMR data indicate that the truncations in the SNARE complex further increase the flexibility of the accessory helix (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>) and produce flexibility in the N-terminus of the CpxI central helix (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) as well as in the C-terminus of SNAP-25 where the FRET donor probe was placed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The loss in FRET efficiency observed by Kummel et al. upon truncation of the SNARE complex can be readily explained by all these increases in flexibility and the fact that SC\u039460 lacks key residues of synaptobrevin that contact CpxI without the truncation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

However, a small decrease in donor fluorescence was actually observed for this mutant (Figure 4D of <a href=\"#bib27\">Kummel et al., 2011</a>) and, based on other measurements shown in Figure 4C and Supplementary Table 3 in Kummel et al., 2011, such decrease would correspond to a distance of ca. 42 \u00c5, just 8 \u00c5 longer than the distance measured without the GPGP insertion. Considering that a flexible sequence of four residues can readily span 8 \u00c5, that the insertion of these residues is expected to push away the fluorescence probes, and that the error in such long distances is expected to be rather large because of the low associated FRET efficiencies, the results obtained with the GPGP mutant are not inconsistent with the conclusion that increased flexbility underlies the decreased FRET caused by the synaptobrevin truncation."

Note for instance that our NMR and ITC data were obtained with truncated SNARE complexes in solution and hence do not rule out the possibility that the CpxI accessory helix interacts with trans-SNARE complexes partially assembled between membranes. Moreover, while cell\u2013cell fusion assays do not correlate with our electrophysiological data or with the stimulatory function of complexins in release, these assays were crucial to establish the functional interplay between complexins and synaptotagmin-1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Giraudo et al., 2006</a>) and did provide support for the insertion model (<a href=\"#bib16\">Giraudo et al., 2009</a>).

                        "text": "The model proposed here is attractive because of its simplicity and because it emerges naturally from the realization that the accessory helix of complexins is negatively charged (see Supplementary figure 1 of <a href=\"#bib20\">Huntwork and Littleton (2007)</a>), together with examination of the crystal structure of the WT CpxI(26-83)/SNARE complex. Thus, binding of the central helix to the SNARE complex places the accessory helix right between the membranes at the space where they need to be brought together for fusion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), and such action is very likely to be hindered at least to some extent by steric and electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged membranes and the accessory helix. Note also that the stronger inhibitory activity of the accessory helix of dmCpx, compared to the mammalian CpxI accessory helix (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), cannot arise from increased hydrophobicity, but can be explained by our electrostatic hindrance model. The model is also supported by the inhibition of release caused by the 5E mutation, as well as by the increase in release caused by the 3R mutation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Moreover, the impairment in release that we observed for the K26A mutant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>; charge change = \u22121), and the increase in spontaneous release caused in rescue experiments on complexin knockdown neurons by a K26E, L41K, E47K mutation (charge change = +1) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yang et al., 2010</a>) also correlate in general terms with this model. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution, since it is plausible that the 5E and 3R mutations may alter the helical character of the accessary helix, and the considerable magnitude of the effects caused by the K26A and K26E, L41K, E47K mutations suggest that they do not arise only from changes in overall electrostatic potential. Thus, K26 might be involved in some additional, as yet unidentified interaction. Note that K26 does not really form part of the accessory helix in the CpxI(26-83)/SNARE complex and may be involved in releasing the inhibition caused by the accessory helix (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xue et al., 2010</a>)."

Our previous studies demonstrate an overall facilitatory effect of complexin for evoked and spontaneous release that requires binding of the complexin N-terminus back onto the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xue et al., 2010</a>). This proposed loop may serve two functions, namely to further stabilize the trans-SNARE complex and to properly position the accessory helix near the putative fusion area to reduce spontaneous release through its electrostatic repulsion effect. Alternatively, it is plausible that the function of the accessory helix may involve interactions with other components of the release machinery. Clearly, more research will be required to further test the validity of our model, ideally using diverse approaches. Such approaches should include challenging biophysical studies involving trans-SNARE complexes formed between two membranes, reconstitution experiments that have already yielded a wealth of information on complexins (e.g., <a href=\"#bib45\">Schaub et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yoon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Malsam et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Diao et al., 2012</a>), and correlations with additional studies of neurotransmitter release in neurons."

Briefly, cells were lysed using 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors (complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet, Roche Diagnostics GmbH; Manheim, Germany). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% milk powder (Carl Roth GmbH) for 1 hr at room temperature, membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-CpxI/II (1:1000; Synaptic System) and mouse anti-tubulinIII (1:750; Sigma\u2013Aldrich) antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing and incubation with corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies (all from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), protein expression levels were visualized with ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare Biosciences)."

Then cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS for 1 hr and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C in blocking solution. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-FLAG (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich; Saint Louis, MO), guinea pig anti-VGlut1 (1:4000; Synaptic System). Primary antibodies were labeled with anti-mouse Rhodamine Red and anti-guinea pig Alexa Fluor 405 (each 1:500; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories; West Groove, PA) for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing, cover slips were mounted with Mowiol 4-88 antifade medium (Polysciences Europe GmbH; Eppelheim, Germany). Neurons were imaged using an Olympus IX81 microscope."

Rizo, Rosenmund and co-workers then present a large body of solution NMR data that does not show any evidence for an interaction between the accessory helix and the truncated SNARE complex, even for the so-called superclamp mutant, suggesting the interaction represents an extremely weak, lowly occupied state.

Similarly, a correlation graph of CpxI shift changes (vs. full length minus random coil) for the shift changes in the N-terminus of the central helix would provide stronger support for the \u201cincreasingly flexible toward the N-terminus\u201d statement. Alternatively, 15N relaxation measurements would make this more quantitative, but not necessary from my perspective if indeed the shift change is in the random coil direction."

The poor-clamp mutant (K26E, K41K, E47K, also somewhat negatively charged) by Yang et al. (Neuron, 2010) actually increases spontaneous release in neuronal cultures. These contradictions need to be addressed by additional experiments, or the negative charge model needs to be modified."

This indicates promiscuity of the interaction between the accessory helix and the 2nd SNARE complex in the crystal structures. This point needs some clarification in the Discussion: first these two alternative forms only occur upon the additional F34M mutation. Second, it is not necessarily that crystallization has induced this interaction. It is possible that this weak interaction is a lowly state that is too infrequent to be observed by NMR, but has been stabilized in the context of the crystal structure."

They showed that the more VAMP is truncated at the C-terminus, truncation of VAMP up to residue 60, the weaker the FRET efficiency. In this work, the NMR results and the weaker affinity observed by ITC suggests that the VAMP truncations make SNAP-25 and also syntaxin more flexible and unstructured, thus destabilizing the interaction with complexin as well, resulting in lower FRET. Thus, an interpretation of the NMR result is that the lower FRET efficiency is a result of motional averaging of multiple conformations that produces the appearance of a lower FRET \u201cstate\u201d. However, Kummel et al. did an experiment to rule out this possibility: They used a 'flexible' CPX construct (CPX-GPGP), in which a helix-breaking GPGP linker was inserted between the central and accessory helices of CPX (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b,c,d</a>, Supplemental Table 3 in Kummel et al.). To quote Kummel et al. \u201cthese experiments indicate that when CPX is bound to a half-zippered form of the SNARE complex, CPXacc has the intrinsic property of extending away from the complex. Because this conformation is maintained in solution, it determines how the complex crystallizes and not vice versa.\u201d"

It is certainly possible that this happens, but the data presented here do not provide direct (e.g., NMR) evidence for this notion. Moreover, the proposed model of electrostatic-steric hindrance by the accessory helix remains speculative. It is of course fine to provide such a speculative model in the Discussion section of the paper. However, the title is misleading since it suggests that the model has been definitely proven in this work. Rather, the main focus of this paper is a re-examination of the interaction between the accessory helix and the truncated SNARE complex that was previously studied by Kummel et al. Thus, we request a change of title to properly reflect the main focus of this work."

Secondly, the last statement \u201cthat the interactions leading to the zigzag array are not specific and are induced by crystallization\u201d implies that crystal packing may induce non-specific interactions. To the contrary, the observation of such an interaction in different crystal forms and for different mutations of residue 34 (albeit with a register shift observed in the second crystal form for some of the non-crystallographic related molecules) actually speaks against an entirely non-specific interaction. Moreover, the crystallization conditions seem not unusual, and the pH is comparable for the crystallization and NMR experiments. There is one clear difference: in the crystal structure, two complexin molecules are interacting with the truncated SNARE complex. It is theoretically possible that binding of the central complexin helix to the SNARE complex is required in order to enable binding of the accessory helix of the second complexin molecule. Thus, we remain concerned about this difference between the crystal structures and the solution NMR studies on the same system, and the discussion must be modified to properly describe this discrepancy, and provide possible alternative explanations."

We agree that the main point of the paper is that it entirely opens the question of how complexin inhibits release, and that the new model we propose is speculative. However, we still would like to propose the model because it provides a testable hypothesis, because it led to the design of the experiments with the 5E and 3R mutants (otherwise we have no rationale for this design), and because it is supported by the electrophysiological data obtained with these mutants (see also response to point 2). Nevertheless, we present the model as a suggestion and make it clear in the discussion that the model will need to be tested with further research. Moreover, we included the term \u2018steric\u2019 in the model (in the title, abstract, etc.) because the hindrance caused by the accessory helix could arise from both electrostatic and steric effects, and because this gives further flexibility to the model for testing in the future."

However, inspection of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a> shows that there was actually a small decrease in the donor fluorescence in the experiments performed with CPX-GPGP, compared to the donor only control. While this decrease is small, it is comparable to that observed for CPX with the acceptor on residue 31 bound to the truncated SNARE complex (cyan curve in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>), which was used in Supplementary Table 3 to calculate a distance of 42 \u00c5. Note also that the FRET efficiency observed for Cpx labeled at residue 38 (without the flexible GPGP insertion) and bound to the truncated SNARE complex was rather low and yielded a distance of 34 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4b,c</a> and Supplementary Table 3 of Kummel et al.). Hence, the difference in the distances that can be calculated from the FRET data presented for CPX and CPX-GPGP bound to the truncated SNARE complex is just 8 \u00c5, a rather short distance considering the large errors expected for such low FRET efficiencies. Moreover, the insertion of the GPGP sequence between the central and accessory helices is expected to push the fluorescence probe placed in the Cpx accessory helix away from the probe on the truncated SNARE complex, and it is reasonable for a flexible sequence of four residues such as GPGP to span a distance of approximately 8 \u00c5. Hence, the experiments performed with GPGP do not really rule out the flexibility argument."

For the expansions showing the cross-peaks of A30 and Q38 in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D, E</a>, we increased the contour levels proportionately to facilitate observation of the positions of the cross-peaks from the different spectra. Hence, the cross-peak intensities that can be deduced from these plots cannot be directly compared among the spectra. This choice was not meant in any way to bias or confuse the reader, but we realize that it has caused confusion for the review and we are sorry about that. To avoid this confusion in the new revised manuscript and still enable the reader to see the progressive shifts of cross - peaks in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B, C</a>, without overcrowding the center of the spectra, we have left the same contour levels in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B, C</a>, but we have adjusted the levels of the expansions of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D,E</a> to allow direct comparison of cross-peak intensities. We have explained these choices of contour levels in the figure legend. The expansions of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D, E</a> now show that the cross-peaks of A30 and Q38 are considerably stronger for CpxI(26- 83) bound to SC 62 and SC 68 than for CpxI(26-83) bound to SC, as shown quantitatively in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013Figure supplements 1C,D</a>."

Firstly, the area of the interface between the accessory helix and the truncated SNARE complex is actually quite reasonable (715 A^2) and this in itself does not suggest that this contact is induced by \u201ccrystal packing\u201d. Secondly, the last statement \u201cthat the interactions leading to the zigzag array are not specific and are induced by crystallization\u201d implies that crystal packing may induce non-specific interactions. To the contrary, the observation of such an interaction in different crystal forms and for different mutations of residue 34 (albeit with a register shift observed in the second crystal form for some of the non-crystallographic related molecules) actually speaks against an entirely non-specific interaction. Moreover, the crystallization conditions seem not unusual, and the pH is comparable for the crystallization and NMR experiments. There is one clear difference: in the crystal structure, two complexin molecules are interacting with the truncated SNARE complex. It is theoretically possible that binding of the central complexin helix to the SNARE complex is required in order to enable binding of the accessory helix of the second complexin molecule. Thus, we remain concerned about this difference between the crystal structures and the solution NMR studies on the same system, and the discussion must be modified to properly describe this discrepancy, and provide possible alternative explanations</i>."
