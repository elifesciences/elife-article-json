The function of Lrp4 in the brain, however, is unknown, as <i>Lrp4<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice fail to form neuromuscular synapses and die at birth. <i>Lrp4<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, rescued for Lrp4 expression selectively in muscle, survive into adulthood and showed profound deficits in cognitive tasks that assess learning and memory. To learn whether synapses form and function aberrantly, we used electrophysiological and anatomical methods to study hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. In the absence of Lrp4, the organization of the hippocampus appeared normal, but the frequency of spontaneous release events and spine density on primary apical dendrites were reduced. CA3 input was unable to adequately depolarize CA1 neurons to induce long-term-potentiation. Our studies demonstrate a role for Lrp4 in hippocampal function and suggest that patients with mutations in <i>Lrp4</i> or autoantibodies to Lrp4 should be evaluated for neurological deficits."
