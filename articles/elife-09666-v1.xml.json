This means that the compass need not be located on the surface of the body. Many organisms have large structures such as eardrums and lenses to manipulate or focus sound and other cues from the environment. However, since very few biological materials affect magnetic fields, an internal compass is unlikely to have a large structure for this purpose. Thus, the internal compass could be microscopic, contained within cells, and potentially scattered throughout the body."

If this preference is due to external or environmental factors that alter the regulation of genes (known as epigenetics), then it would surely be reset to the new location after some generations. Could it be directly encoded by the genetic sequence of the worm? If so, it would suggest that there is a strong adaptive pressure to encode and retain this information."

They used a calcium-sensitive protein to show that the AFD neurons responded to a magnetic field of the same strength as the Earth's, and that another type of sensory neuron did not respond. Studies of worms with mutations in some of the genes expressed in the AFD neurons showed that the <i>tax-4</i> gene, which encodes an ion channel protein similar to a photoreceptor found in the retina of human eyes, is required for magnetotaxis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

This allows birds to combine light input with magnetic sensors to create a visual-magnetic map for navigation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Kishkinev and Chernetsov, 2015</a>). Since AFD neurons have been implicated in controlling movements made in response to temperature and chemical stimuli (<a href=\"#bib5\">Mori, 1999</a>), this suggests that worms may also combine magnetic field information with other sensory inputs to navigate."

This represents a significant advance in our understanding of the neurobiology that underlies how organisms navigate using the Earth's magnetic field. However, it is likely only the beginning of the contributions that studies of <i>C. elegans</i> will make to our understanding of how animals navigate using magnetic fields."
