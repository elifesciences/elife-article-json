Unlike what happens with Ras, the glutamine residue in the switch II motif in Rab33 does not contribute directly to the catalysis of GTP hydrolysis: instead it is involved in the interaction between the Rab33 enzyme and the GAP protein. Moreover, mutation of the Rab switch II glutamine residue leads to only a 3\u201310 fold decrease in catalytic efficiency, whereas mutation of the arginine and glutamine fingers (which belong to the GAP protein) leads to a 100\u20131000 fold decrease (<a href=\"#bib8\">Pan et al., 2006</a>).

This residue is stabilized by an interaction with a glutamic acid residue (E192) on the Bet3p subunit of the exchange factor, leading to the displacement of GDP from the nucleotide binding site.

Thus, a glutamine to leucine mutation is widely assumed to generate the active conformation of these proteins. However, for Rab GTPases, if the catalytic glutamine residue is supplied by the GAP protein, one cannot assume that such a mutation will be of any significant consequence in cells, since a GAP protein may still be able to inactivate this enzyme. Indeed, the yeast equivalent of Rab1 can be inactivated by a GAP protein, even when it harbours a mutation of the switch II glutamine residue (to leucine), both in vitro and in cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">De Antoni et al., 2002</a>)."

However, this is not true for all GAP proteins. Pathogenic bacteria often have virulence factors that mimic the functions normally performed by host cell proteins. The LepB protein from pathogenic <i>Legionella</i> is a Rab1 GAP protein that uses a distinct mechanism to stabilize the switch II glutamine residue in Rab1 in a catalytically competent conformation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). A mutation of the glutamine residue in this context causes a \u223c10,000-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (<a href=\"#bib5\">Gazdag et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Mishra et al., 2013</a>). This contrasts with GAP proteins from <i>Shigella</i> and certain forms of <i>E. coli</i> that catalyse the hydrolysis of the bound GTP molecule using the dual-finger mechanism, despite having structures that are very different from those of the GAP proteins found in the host cell (<a href=\"#bib3\">Dong et al., 2012</a>)."

It used to be assumed that this mutation would result in active Rab enzymes. In Rab1 and Rab35, however, this mutation yields a form of the protein that cannot be activated by the relevant guanine nucleotide exchange factor: however, a different exchange factor was able to activate the mutant form of Rab1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Langemeyer et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, while the mutant forms of Rab1 and Rab35 were poor substrates for certain GAP proteins, a GAP protein called RUTBC3 could bind to and act upon mutant Rab5 protein, similar to previous reports from other groups (see, e.g., <a href=\"#bib8\">Pan et al., 2006</a>). The glutamine mutation had little effect on the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis by Rab1, but a significant effect for Rab5. Thus, the switch II glutamine residues display much more diverse roles than previously thought."

These findings indicate that the entire field of Rab biology has relied upon false assumptions. Mutant proteins that we thought could not be inactivated may, in fact, never have been activated in the first place, and residues that we presumed were important actually play roles quite unlike what we anticipated. This could have led to, for example, screens for Rab GTPase function completely missing important roles performed by these enzymes. Studies of host\u2013pathogen interactions would also have been undermined: for example, while <i>Legionella</i> uses GAP proteins that rely on the switch II glutamine residue for their catalytic activity, <i>Shigella</i> does not."

Rab GTPases can be activated and inactivated by a variety of molecular mechanisms, and even a single Rab GTPase can be modulated by multiple means. The large number of Rab GTPases (and related GAP proteins, exchange factors and other proteins) will each require careful analysis to understand their precise roles and the mechanisms they use to perform these roles in cells. Scientists beware: not all Rab GTPase switch II glutamine mutations represent constitutively active forms."
