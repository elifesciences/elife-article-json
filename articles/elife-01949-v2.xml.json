In this study, we demonstrate that T cell-specific deletion of the IL-6 receptor \u03b1 chain (IL-6R\u03b1) results in impaired Th1 and Th17 T cell responses in vivo, and a defect in Tfh function. Depletion of Tregs in these mice rescued the Th1 but not the Th17 response. Our data suggest that IL-6 signaling in effector T cells is required to overcome Treg-mediated suppression in vivo. We show that IL-6 cooperates with IL-1\u03b2 to block the suppressive effect of Tregs on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, at least in part by controlling their responsiveness to IL-2. In addition, although IL-6R\u03b1-deficient T cells mount normal primary Th1 responses in the absence of Tregs, they fail to mature into functional memory cells, demonstrating a key role for IL-6 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation."

In this study, we demonstrate that T cell-specific deletion of the IL-6 receptor \u03b1 chain (IL-6R\u03b1) results in impaired Th1 and Th17 T cell responses in vivo, and a defect in Tfh function. Depletion of Tregs in these mice rescued the Th1 but not the Th17 response. Our data suggest that IL-6 signaling in effector T cells is required to overcome Treg-mediated suppression in vivo. We show that IL-6 cooperates with IL-1\u03b2 to block the suppressive effect of Tregs on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, at least in part by controlling their responsiveness to IL-2. In addition, although IL-6R\u03b1-deficient T cells mount normal primary Th1 responses in the absence of Tregs, they fail to mature into functional memory cells, demonstrating a key role for IL-6 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation."

The DC maturation process involves a redistribution of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules from intracellular endocytic compartments to the cell surface, increased expression of costimulatory molecules, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which is essential for the activation of naive T cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Banchereau and Steinman, 1998</a>). Previously, we demonstrated that TLR-induced DC maturation and migration to the draining lymph nodes, in the absence of TLR-induced inflammatory cytokines, is insufficient for the induction of T cell activation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2004</a>). T cell responses are controlled by naturally occurring CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs), which play an important role in maintaining immune tolerance and homeostasis. Accordingly, the absence of Foxp3, the lineage-defining transcription factor that is critical for the generation and function of Tregs results in the development of a fatal autoimmune disease (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fontenot and Rudensky, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sakaguchi, 2005</a>). We previously found that cytokines produced by DCs following TLR activation are critical for releasing responder CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from suppression by Tregs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2003</a>). Based on in vitro experiments as well as the analysis of complete IL-6 KO mice, we implicated IL-6 as a mediator for this block of suppressor activity (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2003</a>). However, the pleiotropic nature of IL-6 has made it difficult to assess the T cell-specifc function of this cytokine in vivo."

Recently, IL-6 has also been implicated in the differentiation of specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets. IL-6 has been demonstrated to be an important cytokine that governs the differentiation of Th17 cells. In particular, it is thought to regulate the switch between the induction of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and Th17 cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bettelli et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Veldhoen et al., 2006</a>). Stimulating T cells with TGF-\u03b2 results in the induction of Foxp3, whereas combining TGF-\u03b2 with IL-6 represses Foxp3 expression and induces retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-\u03b3t, resulting in the differentiation of Th17 cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ivanov et al., 2006</a>). IL-6 has also been suggested to be essential for the differentiation of the T follicular helper (Tfh) cell lineage, which is defined by expression of the markers CXCR5 and programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). Treating T cells with IL-6 leads to the upregulation of the transcriptional repressor B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6), a process that is thought to drive Tfh cell generation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Johnston et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Nurieva et al., 2009</a>).

Homodimerization of gp130 upon IL-6 binding results in the activation of the gp130-associated tyrosine kinases JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 and the subsequent phosphorylation of the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kamimura et al., 2003</a>). In addition to the membrane-bound receptor, a soluble form of the IL-6R\u03b1 chain can be generated through either alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage and is capable of binding to IL-6 and activating cells through association with gp130 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kamimura et al., 2003</a>). Although both IL-6-deficient mice and mice bearing a T cell-specific deletion of gp130 have been used to examine the in vivo function of IL-6 in T cell responses, the pleiotropic nature of IL-6, as well as the promiscuous use of the gp130 signaling subunit, has complicated these analyses (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kamimura et al., 2003</a>). Thus, the T cell-specific role of IL-6 signaling in vivo has remained poorly understood."

Our data not only confirm an important function for IL-6 in Th17 cell differentiation, but also reveal a critical role for IL-6 in the induction of the Th1 cell response in vivo. IL-6 enables T cell activation by acting on responder CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to make them less sensitive to the suppressive activity of Tregs, in part by blocking Treg-mediated inhibition of IL-2R\u03b1 expression in responder CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in cooperation with IL-1\u03b2. Although not absolutely required for the generation of Tfh cells, we also found that IL-6 signaling is important for the ability of these cells to provide help to B cells.

Since the Cre-encoding transgene is expressed at the double positive stage in thymic development, both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the periphery of IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice failed to express the IL-6R\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Importantly, both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice remained deficient of the IL-6R\u03b1 after immunization with Ovalbumin (OVA) and LPS emulsified in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) as a carrier, suggesting that the release of the soluble form of the IL-6R\u03b1 during the immune response does not restore IL-6 signaling in these cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Furthermore, IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was blocked in IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to control wild-type (WT) T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To evaluate whether deficiency of the IL-6R\u03b1 on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compromised the gp130-dependent signaling axis, we stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro with \u03b1-CD3e and \u03b1-CD28 mAbs in the presence of gp130-dependent cytokines and measured the phosphorylation of STAT3 1 hr later by Western blot. Addition of IL-6 to the cells phosphorylated STAT3 very effectively in WT cells but not in IL-6R\u03b1-deficient cells, thus confirming the results obtained by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, the addition of the soluble form of the IL-6R\u03b1 (sIL6R\u03b1) together with IL-6 rescued the phosphorylation of STAT3 in IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells whereas IL-11, OSM, or CNTF did not phosphorylate STAT3 in either wild-type or IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that the STAT3-dependent signaling pathway remains intact in IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and that other tested cytokines of the IL-6 family do not play a major role in the activation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We therefore demonstrate efficient deletion of the IL-6R\u03b1 and abrogation of IL-6 signaling in T cells from IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice."

                                "text": "Prior studies suggested that IL-6 is a mediator of T cell survival. Specifically, IL-6 has been shown to protect CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from \u03b1\u2212CD3-induced apoptosis and Fas-mediated cell death in vitro (<a href=\"#bib40\">Takeda et al., 1998</a>). Moreover, complete IL-6-deficient mice were reported to have reduced T cell numbers in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kamimura et al., 2003</a>). We therefore examined how IL-6R\u03b1 deficiency affects T cell homeostasis. We verified that complete IL-6-deficient mice had decreased numbers of T cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In contrast, we found that the absolute numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the thymus and lymph nodes of IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice were similar to that of WT mice (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Consistent with WT levels of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice, we did not observe an increased tendency of IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to undergo apoptosis. These cells became activated (CD44<sup>hi</sup>, CD62L<sup>lo</sup>) and cleaved caspase-3 to the same extent as control cells upon stimulation with \u03b1-CD3 and \u03b1-CD28 in vitro, irrespective of the presence of IL-6 in the culture medium (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Likewise, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the thymus or peripheral lymphoid organs of IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice stained positive for annexin V in similar proportions as WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that IL-6 signaling in T cells is dispensable for T cell homeostasis. Thus, the reduced T cell numbers in complete IL-6-deficient mice are likely a consequence of IL-6 regulating T cell homeostasis indirectly through other cell types."

We found that T cells isolated from IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice showed impaired proliferation upon restimulation with the antigen as measured by [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine incorporation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Furthermore, in contrast to WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice failed to produce IL-17 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In order to confirm this phenotype and characterize the IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice further, we also tested for the induction of Th17-dependent autoimmune diseases in these mice. IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> T cells failed to induce colitis when transferred into RAG2 KO mice (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>) and compared to WT mice, IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice were also resistant to the induction of EAE following immunization with MOG<sub>35-55</sub>/CFA (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). Thus, the Th17 response of IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice was defective, which was expected given the role of IL-6 in Th17 differentiation. However, immunization of the IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice with OVA and LPS in IFA also revealed a profound defect in the Th1 response as IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells failed to secrete robust amounts of IFN-\u03b3 after restimulation with antigen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We obtained similar results following immunization with OVA and other TLR ligands, such as peptidoglycan (PGN), CpG DNA, or the more complex Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013C</a>)."

We confirmed that T cells from IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice were impaired in their ability to proliferate following restimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Although we observed an overall reduction in T cell proliferation, a small fraction of T cells from IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice proliferated normally as assessed by CFSE dilution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) and were able to produce IFN-\u03b3 at similar levels as WT cells. The cells remained deficient in IL-17, regardless of proliferation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These results suggest that the defect in the IFN-\u03b3 response is not due to a requirement for IL-6 in the differentiation of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells. Instead, our results imply that the IFN-\u03b3 response is deficient in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice as a consequence of impaired T cell proliferation. Conversely, the deficient IL-17 response, regardless of proliferative status, reflects a dual requirement of IL-6 for both CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and differentiation of IL-17 producing T cells."

                                "text": "The experiments so far assessed the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response after restimulation with OVA in vitro<i>.</i> Staining CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with MHC class II tetramers is a way to track antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells more directly. In contrast to class II tetramers using OVA-derived peptides, 2W:I-A<sup>b</sup> tetramers, which stain CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that are specific for the 2W peptide, offer a better staining performance. Furthermore, naive 2W-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are more frequent than OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which facilitates the in vivo analysis of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response (<a href=\"#bib27\">Moon et al., 2007</a>). We therefore opted to track antigen-specific T cells with 2W:I-A<sup>b</sup> tetramers following immunization with 2W peptide and LPS in IFA (<a href=\"#bib27\">Moon et al., 2007</a>). To ensure that the choice of a different antigen did not affect the phenotype of IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice, we first immunized the mice with the 2W peptide and measured the proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 secretion following restimulation in vitro<i>.</i> IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not expand and secrete IFN-\u03b3 efficiently (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A,B</a>). Antigen-specific 2W:I-A<sup>b+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice were also less frequent in these cultures compared to WT controls (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5C</a>). These results resembled those obtained with OVA-based immunization and demonstrated that the choice of antigen did not affect the outcome of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response. We thus tracked antigen-specific 2W:I-A<sup>b+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells directly in vivo. We found that the percentage of 2W:I-A<sup>b+</sup> CD44<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was reduced in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice compared with the WT controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Moreover, relative to WT mice, IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice had fewer numbers of cells in their lymph nodes on day 7 after immunization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), which resulted in lower absolute numbers of antigen-specific T cells in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Although the percentage and absolute number of 2W:I-A<sup>b+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly reduced in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice on day 7 following immunization, we found that the small proportion of remaining IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4+ T cells in these mice proliferated to a similar extent as the WT, if not slightly better, as assessed by BrdU incorporation (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6A</a>). Consistently, we failed to see a difference in cell death between WT and IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4+ T cells on day 7 following immunization as determined by active Caspase-3 staining (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6B</a>). Collectively, these results confirm the expected role of IL-6 signaling in Th17 differentiation, but they also reveal a role for IL-6 signaling in regulating T cell expansion and the subsequent induction of Th1 responses in vivo."

Therefore, we asked whether impaired T cell responses in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice are due to unopposed suppression by Tregs in the absence of IL-6 signaling. To test this possibility, IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice were either left untreated or injected with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CD25, which resulted in the depletion of approximately 80% of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) prior to immunization with OVA and LPS in IFA. While CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice with an intact Treg compartment showed impaired proliferation and production of IFN-\u03b3 upon restimulation, these responses were largely rescued upon depletion of Tregs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). This result suggests that IL-6 may control T cell responses by overcoming the suppressive effect of Tregs. Although the IFN-\u03b3 response was restored in the absence of Tregs, the IL-17 response remained defective in these mice, confirming the nonredundant role of IL-6 in Th17 differentiation in vivo, at least under the experimental conditions used in this study."

One possibility is that IL-6 targets conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in order to make them refractory to Treg-mediated suppression. Therefore, in the absence of IL-6 signaling, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells would remain susceptible to suppression by Tregs. Alternatively, IL-6 might target Tregs directly to block their suppressive activity. To test this latter possibility, we generated IL-6R\u03b1<sup>FL/FL</sup>; Foxp3<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice (hereafter called IL-6R\u03b1<sup>TREG-KO</sup> mice) to specifically delete the IL-6R\u03b1 in Tregs.

These findings demonstrate that, at least under the experimental conditions used here, IL-6 signaling is not required in Tregs, and instead IL-6 acts on conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to make them less sensitive to the suppressive effect of Tregs."

Moreover, mice bearing a T cell-specific deletion of gp130 as well as IL-6-deficient mice have been shown to have elevated numbers of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in their secondary lymphoid organs, although this has not been universally observed for the latter mouse strain (<a href=\"#bib22\">Korn et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2008</a>). Therefore, it remained possible that in the absence of the IL-6R\u03b1, Tregs were abnormally expanded in vivo, resulting in the defective T cell proliferation observed in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. To address this, we immunized IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice with OVA and LPS in IFA and analyzed the percentages of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells. We found no significant increase in the proportion of these cells among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, compared to the WT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In support of this notion, we also did not detect significant expansion of antigen-specific Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells following immunization with 2W peptide and LPS in IFA and the absolute numbers of Tregs were lower in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice compared with WT controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Altogether, these results suggest that expansion of induced Tregs or impairment of their function in the absence of IL-6 signaling does not account for the diminished CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response, at least under the experimental conditions used here. Instead, IL-6 signaling is required in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to render them refractory to Treg-mediated suppression."

Since Tfh cells play a critical role in providing help for GC B cells, we wished to characterize the role of IL-6 in regulating this aspect of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell biology. It was previously shown that relative to WT controls, complete IL-6-deficient mice have a strong decrease in the frequency of Tfh cells following protein immunization (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nurieva et al., 2008</a>). However, when we immunized IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice with OVA and LPS in IFA and examined Tfh cell percentages 7 days later by staining for CXCR5 and PD-1, we found only a modest reduction of Tfh cells in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice. In these mice, the frequency of Tfh cells, which were also ICOS<sup>hi</sup> and PSGL-1<sup>low</sup>, was reduced by approximately 25% compared to WT controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), suggesting that IL-6 signaling in T cells does not play an essential role in Tfh cell development, and that IL-6 may affect Tfh cell development indirectly. We then examined Tfh cell function by several approaches. First, we determined the structure of the GCs and the location of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within the GCs in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> and WT controls by immunofluorescence. However, we did not observe obvious changes in the GC structure in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice 14 days after immunization with OVA plus LPS in IFA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We also did not observe a strong reduction in the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within the GCs of IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Next, we analyzed the expression of Bcl-6, the lineage-defining transcription factor for Tfh cells, and IL-21, the Tfh cell-associated cytokine essential for GC formation and antibody production. Indeed, Tfh cells from both WT and IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice upregulated both Bcl6 and IL-21 when compared to non-TFH cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). However, IL-6R\u03b1-deficient Tfh cells failed to reach WT levels of expression for either of the two genes, suggesting a defect in the function of these cells in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice."

Previously, we demonstrated that while depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Tregs in MyD88-deficient mice restored the primary Th1 cell response, the memory response remained defective in these mice after OVA and LPS in IFA immunization (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2004</a>). This result suggested that a MyD88-dependent signal(s) was required for the generation of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Because IL-6 is produced in a MyD88-dependent manner following TLR activation, we investigated whether memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses were dependent on IL-6. First, we determined whether IL-6 signaling is required for the generation or maintenance of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We therefore immunized IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice and WT controls with 2W peptide and LPS in IFA in the presence or absence of Tregs and tracked antigen-specific T cells 30\u201360 days later by 2W:I-A<sup>b</sup> tetramer staining.

Thus, we depleted Tregs twice, prior to the first immunization with either OVA or 2W and again prior to secondary challenge with OVA or 2W 60 days later. This was done because Tregs recover approximately 2 weeks after \u03b1-CD25 treatment. We then monitored the memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response after in vitro restimulation. Although depletion of Tregs in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice rescued primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and the induction of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells following OVA and LPS in IFA immunization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), this was not sufficient for the generation of memory Th1 responses. Proliferation of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and induction of the IFN-\u03b3 response was still defective in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice compared with their WT counterparts following secondary immunization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with this finding, we also noticed a trend towards reduced frequencies of antigen-specific 2W:I-A<sup>b+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in mice 7 days after the second immunization with 2W peptide, even under conditions where Tregs were transiently absent (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that induction of a robust primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response is insufficient for the formation of the memory response and suggests that although IL-6 signaling is not critical for the generation or maintenance of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, it is essential for their function."

To gain insights into the mechanism by which IL-6 performs this function, we cultured CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs at a 1:1 ratio and stimulated these cells with \u03b1\u2212CD3\u03b5/CD28 mAbs in the presence or absence of IL-6. Since T cell responsiveness to IL-2 is important for T cell proliferation, we examined the expression of the IL-2 receptor \u03b1 chain (CD25) by CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>\u2212</sup> responder T cells in the culture on day 3. We found that expression of CD25 by these cells was inhibited in the presence of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). However, addition of exogenous IL-6 to these cultures resulted in partial recovery of CD25 expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Because the effect of IL-6 was partial, we investigated whether other cytokines could fulfill a similar function as IL-6. Separate work in our laboratory indicated that IL-1 may also operate in this process (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schenten et al., 2014</a>). We therefore wondered whether IL-6 and IL-1 cooperate in mediating this function. Indeed, IL-1\u03b2 also partially rescued expression of CD25 by responder CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, although to a lesser extent than IL-6, and the combined addition of both IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 resulted in greater recovery of CD25 expression even in the presence of Tregs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Since IL-15 is another TLR-induced cytokine that had been previously implicated in overcoming Treg-mediated suppression (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shevach, 2009</a>), we also tested whether IL-15 had a similar effect on CD25 expression of CD4<sup>+</sup> responder T cells in the presence of Tregs. Indeed, addition of IL-15 to the culture medium also resulted in the maintenance of CD25 expression (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Moreover, adding both IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 resulted in greater recovery of CD25. Collectively, our results suggest that IL-6 cooperates with IL-1\u03b2 to counter Treg suppression by maintaining T cell responsiveness to IL-2 and other cytokines important for the proliferation and differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

Consequently, the role of IL-6 signaling specifically in T cells has been very difficult to evaluate. In this study, we focused on a specific question about IL-6 signaling, namely its role in the connection between TLR activation and the generation of a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response. Using mice bearing a T cell-specific deletion of the IL-6R\u03b1, we found that the absence of IL-6 signaling in T cells resulted in abrogated expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and impaired development of Th1 and, as expected, Th17 cells following immunization with TLR agonists as adjuvants. In the steady state, IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice had similar numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as their WT counterparts and we did not observe an increase in the fraction of apoptotic T cells in the thymus or periphery of these mice. These results indicate that the impairment of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice was not due to a T cell-intrinsic defect in survival in the absence of IL-6 signaling. Because we had previously demonstrated that cytokines produced by DCs in response to TLR activation, in particular IL-6, render CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells refractory to Treg-mediated suppression in vitro, we hypothesized that the defect in T cell responses in these mice might be caused by unopposed suppression by Tregs. Indeed, depletion of CD25<sup>+</sup> Tregs restored the development of the Th1 response in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice, while the Th17 response was not rescued, which is consistent with the role of IL-6 in the differentiation of Th17 cells. Moreover, deleting the IL-6R\u03b1 specifically in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs revealed that IL-6 signaling is not required in these cells for the generation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and instead suggested that IL-6 signaling in conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was critical for the generation of a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response. Collectively, these data therefore support a model in which IL-6 signaling in naive T cells makes them refractory to the suppressive activity of Tregs in vivo."

STAT3 has been demonstrated to be important for Tfh cell differentiation after protein immunization (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nurieva et al., 2008</a>). Thus, in the absence of IL-6 signaling, another STAT3-dependent cytokine such as IL-21 might compensate for IL-6 in inducing the development of Tfh cells. Indeed, IL-21 has been demonstrated to play an important role in Tfh cell generation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nurieva et al., 2008</a>). Tfh cells play a critical role in providing help for GC B cells. Therefore, to examine the effects of IL-6 on Tfh cell function, we analyzed GC formation, plasma cell differentiation and antibody production in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice. Although Tfh cells could develop in these mice, there was a reduction in the GC compartment size the percentage of plasma cells and, importantly, the amount of antigen-specific antibodies following immunization. Defective IL-6 signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells affected predominantly the titers of antigen-specific IgG2c, while the titers of antigen-specific IgG1 were only modestly reduced. In this context, it is interesting to note that IFN-\u03b3, the signature cytokine of Th1 cells, is important for class-switch recombination (CSR) to IgG2c. The role of Tfh cells in the initiation of CSR has not been fully understood. Under conditions of Th2 immunity, Tfh cells have been identified as the major source of the IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 required for the induction of CSR to IgG1 and IgG2c, respectively (<a href=\"#bib41\">Veldhoen et al., 2006</a>). In analogy, defective IFN-\u03b3 secretion by Tfh cells in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice may cause the impairment of the IgG2c response in these mice. Indeed, we found substantial amounts of Tfh cells in the T cell assays with which we measured IFN-\u03b3 secretion, which would be consistent with this view (data not shown). Alternatively, it is possible that under the conditions used in our study, CSR is already initiated outside of the GCs and the absence of a functional Th1 response negatively influences CSR to IgG2c. Regardless of these possibilities, however, our data collectively demonstrate that IL-6, while dispensable for the generation of Tfh cells, plays a nonredundant role in the function of these cells. Interestingly, depletion of Tregs recovered the antigen-specific IgG2c titers in IL-6\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice, suggesting that the activity of Tfh cells is negatively regulated by Tregs and this negative control is opposed by T cell-intrinsic IL-6 signaling."

In search of the mechanism by which IL-6 counteracts the suppressive activity of Tregs, we found that both Tregs and TGF-\u03b2 inhibited expression of CD25 on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and this inhibition could be partially prevented by IL-6 and completely prevented by the combined effect of IL-6 and IL-1. Studies have shown that IL-1 is important for Th17 cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acosta-Rodriguez et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sutton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Volpe et al., 2008</a>). IL-1 has been demonstrated to augment Th17 differentiation induced by IL-6 in combination with TGF-\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Veldhoen et al., 2006</a>). Recently, it has been suggested that IL-6 induces the upregulation of the IL-1R and that this effect is a pre-requisite for the differentiation of Th17 cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chung et al., 2009</a>). Consistent with this view, our own gene expression studies on antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from immunized IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> and MyD88<sup>T-KO</sup> mice also revealed a downregulation of the IL-1R in antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the absence of IL-6 signaling (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schenten et al., 2014</a>). While further studies are required to determine whether this particular mechanism also applies to other T cell lineages, it appears that IL-6 and IL-1 cooperate not only in the induction of Th17 differentiation but also in the generation of a Th1 response. In the context of the latter response, our work demonstrates that IL-6 and IL-1 are both important to overcome Treg-mediated suppression, perhaps in part by cooperating in the maintenance of the sensitivity of CD4<sup>+</sup> responder T cells to IL-2 and other relevant instructive cytokines such as IL-12 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schenten et al., 2014</a>). It is likely that other cytokines or cytokine combinations may play a similar role in other types of T cell responses, depending on the pathogen and PRRs involved. It should be noted in this regard that several cytokines, including IL-15, have been shown to render CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells resistant to the suppressive activity of Tregs in vitro (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ben Ahmed et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, we found that similar to IL-6 and IL-1, IL-15 is also able to counter Treg-mediated downregulation of CD25 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This raises the possibility that control of CD25 expression on naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may be a common mechanism utilized by different cytokines induced by different pathways of innate immune recognition. It was previously demonstrated that IL-15 overcomes Treg-mediated suppression by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI-3 kinases), which are key regulators of cell growth, survival, and proliferation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ben Ahmed et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, both IL-6 and IL-1 have also been implicated in the initiation of PI-3 kinase signaling (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hideshima et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Madge and Pober, 2000</a>). This raises the possibility that the similarity in the ability of these cytokines to maintain the sensitivity of responder T cells to IL-2 signals in the presence of Tregs may be due to their shared function in inducing this important signaling pathway. Further studies are needed to determine whether inhibiting the PI-3 kinase pathway downstream of IL-6 and IL-1 signaling results in a failure to rescue the down-regulation of CD25 expression and susceptibility to Treg-mediated suppression. It should also be noted that while control of CD25 expression may be applicable to naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the Th1 differentiation pathway, other stages of T cell responses (e.g., memory response) and other differentiation pathways (e.g., Th17 and Tfh) are likely to be counter-regulated by IL-6 and Tregs through a different control point. The counter-regulation by IL-6 and Tregs in these cases may still rely on the same principle, that is, regulated expression of a receptor for an autocrine cytokine that controls cell expansion and maintenance. Possible candidates include IL-21 and the IL-21R (for Tfh and Th17 cells), and IL-4 and the IL-4 receptor for Th2 cells. Indeed, our in vitro studies indicate that IL-6 and Tregs may also counter-regulate the IL-4R\u03b1, IL-21R, and the common \u03b3-chain (data not shown). Future studies will need to address this possibility in vivo."

The late time point allowed us to obtain enough cells for the analysis but likely missed important changes in the gene expression at early stages of the immune response. Thus, the observed changes in the cellular pathways in IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T might be biased by the presence of IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that have escaped the Treg-mediated control mechanisms. This caveat of the analysis aside, we did observe a repression of STAT3-induced genes, thereby confirming the general approach of the analysis. IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells up-regulated cell cycle genes during the late stage of the immune response. At this point, the cell may attempt to proliferate, particularly in light of the lower absolute numbers of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice, but are unable to do so because of a failure to induce ribosome production. The latter observation, namely a defect in the up-regulation of ribosome-associated genes in IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, appeared to be one of the most significant changes in these cells. Interestingly, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells heterozygous for the ribosomal protein S6, which is also down-regulated in IL-6R\u03b1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, increase their size after TCR stimulation but fail to proliferate (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sulic et al., 2005</a>). Indeed, increased ribosome production accompanies increased cytokine production following TCR stimulation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Asmal et al., 2003</a>). Thus, decreased ribosome generation may be a consequence of Treg-mediated suppression in the absence of IL-6 signal. Further studies will be required to elucidate this aspect."

Previously, using MyD88-deficient mice, we showed that a TLR-induced signal was necessary for the formation of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2004</a>). However, the nature of the signal was unclear at the time. In the present study, we found that although depleting Tregs rescued the primary Th1 response in the absence of IL-6 signaling in T cells, the memory response was still defective. Furthermore, we found that antigen-specific memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were still generated, even though the IFN-\u03b3 response was impaired in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice. This result suggests that IL-6 signaling is required for the generation of functionally competent memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Importantly, in a parallel study, we found that the functionally competent memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells also depend on T cell-specific IL-1 signaling, suggesting that IL-6 and IL-1 cooperate in this aspect of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response as well (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schenten et al., 2014</a>).

FPKM values of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from two mouse strains were determined using the Cuff-diff program. A pseudocount of 0.01 was added to all FPKM values to prevent dividing by zero and only genes with an FPKM \u22651 in either group were included in the analysis.

However, several technical hurdles make this effort challenging. First, CD25 expression after the activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is known to be very transient and we are unable to detect enough antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with an activated phenotype (CD44<sup>+</sup>) at early time points (&lt;3 days) of the immune response. Second, the analysis of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at later stages of the response (day 4-7) is hampered by the fact that one presumably only interrogates cells in IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice that have escaped Treg-mediated suppression. Thus, the analysis might be biased by the presence of these escapees during the late stages of the response. This caveat aside, we have performed a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on the gene expression profiles of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice and wild-type controls in order to gain more mechanistic insights. In the new <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 2</a>, we present the interesting finding from this analysis that IL6Ra-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are severely impaired in their ribosomal metabolism.

In all of these assays, we isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the draining lymph nodes of immunized IL-6R\u03b1<sup>T-KO</sup> mice and wild-type controls and co-cultured them with irradiated splenocytes from na\u00efve wild-type mice. Thus, differences in the outcome of these assays must reflect the differences in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which also are the only cells capable of proliferation. Defective IL-6 signaling in Tregs cannot account for these differences as Tregs are not present in concentrations that would typically result in the suppression of responder T cells in vitro. Moreover, we have shown that IL-6R\u03b1-deficient Tregs suppress as efficiently as wild-type Tregs in vitro (new <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 3</a>).

It remains possible that these cytokines are important to the physiology of T cells at later stages of the effector phase. However, these events were not the focus of our study."

Deletion of exon 2 and 3 upon Cre-mediated recombination leads to a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon in exon 4. As a result, only exon 1 and an additional non-sense 20 aa are encoded by the deleted allele. The binding site to IL-6 is encoded by the deleted exon 2 and 3, thus the deleted allele produces a non-functional protein. We have added this information in the manuscript."
