In this study, we identify <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> NOCA-1 as a protein with homology to vertebrate ninein. NOCA-1 contributes to the assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in multiple tissues. In the larval epidermis, NOCA-1 functions redundantly with the minus end protection factor Patronin/PTRN-1 to assemble a circumferential microtubule array essential for worm growth and morphogenesis. Controlled degradation of a \u03b3-tubulin complex subunit in this tissue revealed that \u03b3-tubulin acts with NOCA-1 in parallel to Patronin/PTRN-1. In the germline, NOCA-1 and \u03b3-tubulin co-localize at the cell surface, and inhibiting either leads to a microtubule assembly defect. \u03b3-tubulin targets independently of NOCA-1, but NOCA-1 targeting requires \u03b3-tubulin when a non-essential putatively palmitoylated cysteine is mutated. These results show that NOCA-1 acts with \u03b3-tubulin to assemble non-centrosomal arrays in multiple tissues and highlight functional overlap between the ninein and Patronin protein families."

In this study, we identify <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> NOCA-1 as a protein with homology to vertebrate ninein. NOCA-1 contributes to the assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in multiple tissues. In the larval epidermis, NOCA-1 functions redundantly with the minus end protection factor Patronin/PTRN-1 to assemble a circumferential microtubule array essential for worm growth and morphogenesis. Controlled degradation of a \u03b3-tubulin complex subunit in this tissue revealed that \u03b3-tubulin acts with NOCA-1 in parallel to Patronin/PTRN-1. In the germline, NOCA-1 and \u03b3-tubulin co-localize at the cell surface, and inhibiting either leads to a microtubule assembly defect. \u03b3-tubulin targets independently of NOCA-1, but NOCA-1 targeting requires \u03b3-tubulin when a non-essential putatively palmitoylated cysteine is mutated. These results show that NOCA-1 acts with \u03b3-tubulin to assemble non-centrosomal arrays in multiple tissues and highlight functional overlap between the ninein and Patronin protein families."

In contrast, PTRN-1 works independently of \u03b3-tubulin. This suggests that NOCA-1 works together with \u03b3-tubulin to protect new microtubule ends or promote their assembly, a role similar to what has been proposed for Patronin family proteins. Overall, Wang et al.'s results highlight the importance of ninein-related proteins in the assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays and suggest overlapping roles for the ninein and Patronin families of proteins."

Inhibition of the core desmosomal component, desmoplakin, disrupts ninein targeting and formation of the peripheral non-centrosomal microtubule array (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</a>), but direct evidence that ninein is important for array formation is currently lacking."

We show that NOCA-1 shares homology with vertebrate ninein and identify isoforms that are necessary and sufficient for NOCA-1 function in three different tissues. We explore the functional relationship between NOCA-1, \u03b3-tubulin, and Patronin/PTRN-1 in the assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays. In the larval epidermis, NOCA-1 functions with \u03b3-tubulin in parallel to Patronin/PTRN-1 to assemble a circumferential microtubule array required for larval development. In the germline and embryonic epidermis, NOCA-1 functions independently of Patronin to promote assembly of microtubule arrays required for nuclear positioning. Cumulatively, our results suggest that NOCA-1 functions together with \u03b3-tubulin to direct the assembly of non-centrosomal arrays in multiple tissues and highlight functional overlap between the ninein and Patronin families of microtubule cytoskeleton-controlling proteins."

To determine if purified NOCA-1 binds directly to microtubules, we purified GFP-tagged NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup> and NOCA-1<sup>LICR+NHD</sup> from insect cells (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). Hydrodynamic analysis in 500 mM salt indicated that both NOCA-1 fusions were dimeric, whereas GFP-tagged PTRN-1 and DmPatronin were monomeric (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B\u2013D</a>). Unfortunately, lowering the ionic strength to physiological levels caused both NOCA-1<sup>LICR+NHD</sup> and NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup> to precipitate. Adding detergents or stabilizers, such as glycerol or sucrose, did not circumvent this problem; however, we were able to generate an MBP::NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup>::GFP fusion that was soluble at physiological ionic strength. While the ability of this soluble fusion to co-sediment with microtubules was negligible (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4E,F</a>), we did observe that aggregated forms of NOCA-1 fusion proteins associated with microtubules. When small aggregates of GFP::NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup> or GFP::NOCA-1<sup>LICR+NHD</sup> were analyzed in a coverslip-anchorage assay, analogous to that performed previously for Patronin (<a href=\"#bib24\">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>), they anchored microtubules by binding to their ends (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). Similarly, dilution of MBP::NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup>::GFP into a classical microtubule assay buffer caused it to form small aggregates that bound along the lengths of microtubules (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>). These results hint that NOCA-1 may associate directly with microtubules, although significant additional work will be necessary to overcome the limitations imposed by the low solubility of purified NOCA-1 in order to rigorously assess microtubule interactions in vitro."

Embedded in this cell are two lateral rows of seams cells that run along either side of the worm's body. The seam cells fuse to form syncytia at the mid-L4 stage (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chisholm and Hsiao, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Other syncytial cells cover the head and tail. We visualized the microtubule array in the syncytial epidermis by co-expressing GFP::\u03b2-tubulin and mCherry::histone under control of the <i>dpy-7</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib49\">Priess and Hirsh, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Costa et al., 1997</a>), the epidermal microtubule array is composed of regularly spaced circumferential bundles that appear as lines perpendicular to the larva/worm body axis in longitudinal sectional views (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The density of microtubule bundles along the length of the worm was not significantly different from controls in the <i>noca-1\u2206</i> mutant and was only slightly reduced in the <i>ptrn-1\u2206</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). In contrast, significantly fewer microtubule bundles were observed in the <i>noca-1\u2206</i>; <i>ptrn-1\u2206</i> double mutant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>).

When only PTRN-1 was present (<i>noca-1\u2206</i>), microtubules appeared less dynamic than in wild type, whereas microtubules exhibited apparently normal dynamics when only NOCA-1 was present (<i>ptrn-1\u2206</i>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Consistent with this impression, the density of EB1 comets was substantially reduced when only PTRN-1 was present (<i>noca-1\u2206</i>) but was comparable to controls when only NOCA-1 was present (<i>ptrn-1\u2206</i>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). EB1 signal was observed along the lattice of the bundles and only occasionally in comets when only PTRN-1 was present, possibly due to the reduced number of growing microtubule ends. The microtubule growth rate, measured by tracking of EB1 comets, was also reduced by \u223c20% compared to controls in worms expressing PTRN-1 only (<i>noca-1\u2206</i>) but not in worm expressing NOCA-1 only (<i>ptrn-1\u2206</i>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These results suggest that although either NOCA-1 or PTRN-1 can support the assembly of a circumferential microtubule array in the larval epidermis, the presence of NOCA-1 makes the arrays significantly more dynamic."

DLG-1::GFP outlines the junctions between the body epidermis and the seam cell syncytia that are embedded along the left and right sides of the worm (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). In wild-type worms, parallel lines of DLG-1::GFP are observed running along the entire body length. In contrast, in <i>noca-1\u2206; ptrn-1\u2206</i> double mutants, seam cell syncytia were frequently branched/broken (71%; n = 17) as well as disconnected from the head epidermis (68%; n = 22; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This result suggests that the circumferential microtubule array in the body epidermis could have a role in positioning the seam cells prior to fusion. However, since the P<i>dpy-7</i> promoter also directs expression in the seam cells, we also cannot rule out that the fusion defect results from direct effects on the seam cells or their capacity to fuse. In addition to seam cell defects, the cuticles of <i>noca-1\u2206; ptrn-1\u2206</i> mutant worms became permeable to the normally excluded Hoechst dye, beginning \u223c24 hr after the L1 larval stage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). These defects in the epidermis and cuticle likely underlie the rupture phenotype with extrusion of internal tissues observed in <i>noca-1\u2206; ptrn-1\u2206</i> mutant worms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We conclude that NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 function in parallel to promote the assembly of a circumferential array of microtubule bundles that is required for the morphology and integrity of the larval/adult epidermis."

                                "text": "Given their similar localization patterns and the fact that knockdown of NOCA-1 and \u03b3-tubulin resulted in an essentially identical defect in the germline (<a href=\"#bib25\">Green et al., 2011</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> below), we wanted to test whether \u03b3-tubulin functioned in microtubule generation pathways with NOCA-1, PTRN-1, or both in the larval epidermis. Since \u03b3-tubulin is essential for cell division, analyzing its role in the larval epidermis required eliminating \u03b3-tubulin function after the tissue is already formed. To achieve this, we developed a method based on two previously described protein degradation methods (<a href=\"#bib8\">Caussinus et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Armenti et al., 2014</a>) for tissue-specific degradation of a functional GFP-fused target protein. Since fluorescently tagged \u03b3-tubulin fusions were not fully functional (<i>not shown</i>), we used a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated strategy (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dickinson et al., 2013</a>) to insert a C-terminal GFP tag in the endogenous locus of <i>gip-2</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which encodes an essential component of the <i>C. elegans</i> \u03b3-tubulin complex (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hannak et al., 2002</a>). Endogenously tagged GIP-2 fully supported the essential functions of the \u03b3-tubulin complex, as indicated by the normal development of worms homozygous for the insertion. To specifically degrade GIP-2::GFP in the epidermis, we expressed a GFP nanobody::ZIF-1 fusion under an epidermal promoter (P<i>dpy-7</i>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This fusion, which we call <i>epiDEG</i>, serves as a GFP-to-ligase adapter that recognizes GFP-fused target proteins and brings them to the ECS (Elongin-C, Cul2, SOCS-box family) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">DeRenzo et al., 2003</a>). Quantification revealed that the GIP-2::GFP signal in the larval epidermis was reduced by &gt;80% compared to controls in <i>epiDEG</i> worms whereas the signal in the germline was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), indicating the GFP-mediated degradation is efficient and tissue specific. The <i>gip-2::gfp; epiDEG</i> animals grew slightly slower than wild-type worms and a small percentage of them were arrested at early larval stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013G</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), possibly because the <i>dpy-7</i> promoter-driven <i>epiDEG</i> may cause some degradation of GIP-2::GFP in the dividing seam cells. However, the majority of <i>gip-2::gfp; epiDEG</i> animals exhibited normal development."

The <i>C. elegans</i> germline is a syncytial structure in which nuclei in various stages of meiotic prophase are housed in membrane-bound compartments that are open on one side towards the common cytoplasmic core, called the rachis. Non-centrosomal microtubule arrays assemble within the compartments that hold the nuclei near the surface and prevent them from dropping into the rachis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>). Within the rachis there are also microtubules that flow with the streaming cytoplasm into the forming oocytes (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wolke et al., 2007</a>). Imaging germline architecture in worms expressing a GFP-tagged plasma membrane probe along with mCherry-histone or GFP::\u03b2-tubulin revealed that <i>noca-1</i> deletion resulted in an essentially identical phenotype to \u03b3-tubulin depletion; in both cases, nuclei fell out of their compartments and formed clumps in the rachis center, indicating a dramatic failure in the function of the microtubule arrays in the compartments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). In contrast, germline structure in <i>ptrn-1\u2206</i> worms was similar to that in controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Since compartment structure collapsed as the nuclei fell into the rachis, we could not assess the impact of loss of NOCA-1 or \u03b3-tubulin on the dynamics of the arrays within the compartments. However, we were able to measure the density of growing microtubule plus ends, measured as the number of EB1 comets, in a fixed area of the rachis, which was reduced to a similar extent by NOCA-1 and \u03b3-tubulin inhibitions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>)."

Selectively depleting the longest NOCA-1 isoform (NOCA-1h) using a dsRNA targeting its unique N-terminal extension disrupted germline architecture and led to sterility (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), and expressing NOCA-1h from an RNAi-resistant transgene under its own promoter rescued both phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that NOCA-1h is both necessary and sufficient for germline function. Expression of a NOCA-1 truncation that included the NHD and the long isoform common region (NOCA-1<sup>NHD+LICR</sup>) under the same promoter also rescued the effects of depleting NOCA-1h on the germline, whereas expression of the NHD alone did not (NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Thus, in the germline, NOCA-1 function requires the LICR in addition to the NHD, but the h isoform specific region is not essential. We conclude that, in the germline, \u03b3-tubulin and NOCA-1h act independently of PTRN-1 to direct assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays that position nuclei."

As full-length NOCA-1h and NOCA-1<sup>LICR+NHD</sup>, which lack the h isoform-specific region, are both functional, we analyzed the localization of both in control and \u03b3-tubulin-depleted germlines. Surprisingly, NOCA-1<sup>LICR+NHD</sup> required \u03b3-tubulin to localize to compartment surfaces whereas full-length NOCA-1h did not (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). This result suggested that the non-essential isoform-specific region of NOCA-1h harbors a \u03b3-tubulin-independent cell surface targeting activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Consistent with this idea, a GFP fusion with the h isoform specific region localized to compartment surfaces, and this localization was dependent on a predicted palmitoylation site (cysteine 10; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Mutation of this predicted palmitoylation site in the full-length protein (NOCA-1h<sup>C10A</sup>) did not compromise NOCA-1h function but rendered its localization \u03b3-tubulin dependent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This result explains why NOCA-1h localization at compartment surfaces was not eliminated by \u03b3-tubulin depletion and implicates a potential lipid modification in providing a redundant means for NOCA-1 targeting to the membrane."

However, as the major focus has been on centrosomal arrays that are present in dividing cells, the molecular mechanisms underlying this diversity are just beginning to be explored. Here, our analysis in <i>C. elegans</i> has revealed an essential role for the ninein-related protein NOCA-1 in the formation of functional non-centrosomal arrays in three different differentiated tissues (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Direct phenotypic comparisons and controlled ablation following differentiation revealed a close collaboration between NOCA-1 and \u03b3-tubulin in non-centrosomal array formation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In one of the three tissues we examined (the larval epidermis), NOCA-1/\u03b3-tubulin acted in parallel to the microtubule minus end-binding factor PTRN-1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Based on our results, we propose that the formation of functional non-centrosomal arrays involves coordination of ninein family proteins and \u03b3-tubulin, acting in a parallel and potentially mechanistically distinct manner from the Patronin family of microtubule minus end-binding proteins."

Importantly, the isoform-specific regions were not essential for NOCA-1 function in the three different contexts analyzed, suggesting that these regions primarily reflect use of alterative promoters/transcriptional start sites. In the germline, the tissue-specific isoform region directed non-essential, \u03b3-tubulin-independent membrane localization, potentially via palmitoylation of a cysteine residue in the extreme N-terminus.

One model is that \u03b3-tubulin complexes at non-centrosomal sites recruit NOCA-1, which in turn activates their nucleating activity, leading to generation of new microtubules. Structural work on \u03b3-tubulin containing complexes has suggested that their activation may be coupled to interaction with factors that recruit them to specific sites (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kollman et al., 2011</a>). Since <i>C. elegans</i>, like budding yeast, has components of the \u03b3TuSC (\u03b3-tubulin small complex) but not the \u03b3TuRC (\u03b3-tubulin ring complex), one possibility is that NOCA-1 would drive assembly of the \u03b3TuSC into larger \u03b3TuRC-like complexes as proposed for \u03b3TuSC-anchoring factors in budding yeast (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kollman et al., 2011</a>). A second model is that NOCA-1 is recruited by \u03b3-tubulin to generate a structure that stabilizes and/or anchors nascent microtubule minus ends generated by \u03b3-tubulin's nucleating activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Discriminating between these and other possibilities will require solving the challenge of analyzing purified NOCA-1 at physiological ionic strengths, which would enable better reconstitution of the interaction between NOCA-1 and microtubules (whether direct or indirect) in vitro and also enable analysis under conditions that include \u03b3-tubulin-mediated nucleation."

Imaging the dynamics of these bundles revealed that, despite the functional redundancy in supporting growth and morphogenesis, the microtubule arrays formed in the presence of NOCA-1 or PTRN-1 alone were distinct. When PTRN-1 was removed and only NOCA-1 was present, the microtubule growth rate and the number of growing EB1-marked microtubule ends were similar to controls. In contrast, removal of NOCA-1 led to a dramatic effect, causing a threefold reduction in the number of growing EB1-marked microtubule ends (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). At the same time, the microtubules appeared to be less dynamic, and the appearance of the arrays combined with an \u223c20% reduction in growth rate suggests that there may be a small shift in the monomer/polymer balance towards more polymer. One possibility is that these effects result from the differences in the persistence of NOCA-1/\u03b3-tubulin vs Patronin-based structures at microtubule minus ends. For example, NOCA-1/\u03b3-tubulin might release microtubule minus ends more readily, perhaps leading to minus end depolymerization and shorter microtubules, whereas Patronin stretches might be less likely to be released leading to longer microtubules. Differences in microtubule length and minus-end dynamics could, in turn, affect plus-end dynamics. Alternatively, as has previously been proposed for \u03b3-tubulin complexes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Oakley et al., 2015</a>), it is possible that NOCA-1/\u03b3-tubulin and Patronin-based structures affect plus-end dynamics by promoting the loading of different microtubule dynamicity factors. In this vein, the effect of NOCA-1 removal on EB1::GFP localization is particularly interesting. When NOCA-1 is removed, increased amounts of EB1::GFP are observed along the length of the microtubules and an increase is also observed in EB1 comet length (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). It would be very interesting if NOCA-1/\u03b3-tubulin vs Patronin-based structures at minus ends impacted the loading of factors that affect EB1 clearance from microtubules. The differences in the effects of NOCA-1 vs Patronin depletion raise the possibility that the choice between NOCA-1/ninein and/or PTRN-1/Patronin family members in different tissues may be related to the dynamicity (or lack thereof) required for the functions of different types of microtubule arrays. It will be particularly interesting to analyze NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 in the nervous system, where PTRN-1 has already been shown to support normal neuronal morphology and contribute to microtubule assembly and axon regeneration (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chuang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Marcette et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Richardson et al., 2014</a>)."

In contrast, in rat hippocampal neurons, \u03b3-tubulin has been proposed to nucleate microtubules that are subsequently stabilized by CAMSAP2 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yau et al., 2014</a>). Our results in the <i>C. elegans</i> larval epidermis where NOCA-1 and Patronin/PTRN-1 are in parallel pathways with respect to microtubule generation, suggest that \u03b3-tubulin cooperates with NOCA-1 but not with Patronin/PTRN-1.

GFP puncta were enclosed for signal measurements by expanding the selection by 3 pixels on all sides to generate 7-pixel diameter circular regions centered over the 1-pixel-sized selections; area [in] and mean intensity [in] were measured for these regions. Background measurements were generated for each region by expanding the 7-pixel diameter circles by 3 more pixels on each side to generate 13-pixel diameter circular regions centered over the same 1-pixel-sized selections and measuring Area [out] and Mean Intensity [out]. The average background intensity was calculated as Background Intensity = (Area [out] \u00d7 Mean Intensity [out] \u2212 Area [in] \u00d7 Mean Intensity [in])/(Area [out] \u2212 Area [in]). The total intensity of the signal was calculated as Total Intensity = Area [in] \u00d7 (Mean Intensity [in] \u2212 Background Intensity). The normalized intensity is the Total Intensity divided by the Image Area.

The background was calculated by expanding the selected area by 6 more pixels on all sides to measure Area [out] and Mean Intensity [out]. The Background Intensity, Total Intensity, and normalized intensity were then calculated as described above for the epidermis."

NOCA-1 was previously shown by the Oegema group to be required for germline development and fertility. Here, they find that it genetically interacts with and is synthetic lethal with mutations in Ptrn-1 (a minus end binding protein). The essential function occurs in the <i>epidermis</i> where NOCA-1 and Ptrn-1 collaborate to generate bundled microtubule arrays. The authors perform detailed studies to determine the isoforms required for function of NOCA-1 in three distinct tissues. Furthermore, the authors purify NOCA-1 fragments to get at the underlying mechanism/biochemical properties of NOCA-1 and conclude that it can bind to microtubule ends, although, in contrast to in vivo data which point to microtubule minus-end related function, a bias for microtubule plus-end binding is observed."

In the other tissues, no data was given to show that non-centrosomal microtubule arrays were in fact disrupted and that NOCA-1 wasn't required for the proper dynamics of these structures rather than their formation and or organization. Thus, this seems to be based largely on the way that others have thought about ninein function in mammalian cells. It is also unclear how the minus end binding activity results in the phenotypes seen in vivo (such as changes in microtubule growth rates.

Both the approach and the results we obtained are shown in an entirely new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. In brief, our work had revealed parallel roles for NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 in the formation of a functional circumferential microtubule array in the larval <i>epidermis</i> of <i>C. elegans</i>. An important question raised by this finding was whether the \u03b3-tubulin complex acted together with one or both of these factors in non-centrosomal array formation. This experiment was not feasible because the essential role of the \u03b3-tubulin complex in cell division had precluded our ability to analyze its function in the larval <i>epidermis</i>. We were able to overcome this limitation by developing a strategy that enabled selective removal of an essential subunit of the \u03b3-tubulin small complex, GIP-2, in the larval <i>epidermis</i>. In this strategy, we first tagged the endogenous locus encoding GIP-2 with GFP and confirmed functionality of the GIP-2::GFP. Next we engineered a GFP degron that can act in a tissue-specific manner (our degron strategy was inspired by two prior approaches, as described in the manuscript text). We demonstrated that this approach specifically degraded GIP-2::GFP in the larval <i>epidermis</i>, and thus allowed us to test \u03b3-tubulin complex function in that tissue. By combining the GIP-2::GFP and the tissue-specific GFP degron with <i>noca-1\u2206</i> or <i>ptrn-1\u2206</i>, we obtained a very clear result \u2013 the \u03b3-tubulin complex acts together with NOCA-1 (i.e. degradation of GIP-2 does not enhance <i>noca-1\u2206)</i> and in parallel to PTRN-1 (i.e. degradation of GIP-2 strongly enhances <i>ptrn-1\u2206</i>). We believe this is a very important result that significantly extends the conclusions presented in our study and should guide future analysis of various minus end-directed activities in other systems."

As the reviewers highlight, the data supporting direct binding of NOCA-1 binding to microtubule ends has been limited by poor solubility of purified NOCA-1 fragments at physiological ionic strength. During the revision period, we did substantial additional work, outlined in detail below, aimed at clarifying the relationship between NOCA-1 clustering and microtubule binding. This effort revealed that we can only observe binding of purified NOCA-1 fusions to the microtubule lattice and/or microtubule ends when we induce the proteins to form small aggregates. As it is possible that this is an artifact that does not occur in vivo, we decided to <i>move the end anchoring assay data (old</i> <a href=\"#fig6\"><i>Figure 6C\u2013E</i></a><i>) to the supplement where we also now include the results of our new biochemical efforts</i>. Despite the fact that we do not yet have clarity on this issue, we think it is important to document what we have tried, which represents over a year of work, to provide a foundation for future efforts (the biochemistry data is now presented in two new figure supplements, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 5</a>). As suggested, we have removed the suggestion that NOCA-1 is a microtubule end-binding protein from the title and Abstract and have shifted the focus of the manuscript to the analysis of the relative roles of NOCA-1, PTRN-1 and \u03b3-tubulin in the assembly of functional non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in three different <i>C. elegans</i> tissues. To facilitate this shift in focus, we added a new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, in which we employ a tissue-specific protein degradation system that we developed to deplete the essential\u03b3\u2013tubulin complex component GIP-2 from the larval <i>epidermis</i>. This approach allowed us to build on our prior finding that NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 function in parallel pathways for microtubule generation in the larval <i>epidermis</i>, to show that the\u03b3\u2013tubulin complex promotes microtubule generation in the larval <i>epidermis</i> by acting with NOCA-1 and in parallel to the Patronin-dependent pathway. In accordance with these revisions the manuscript has been re-titled to: \u201cNOCA-1 Functions with\u03b3-tubulin and in Parallel to Patronin to Assemble Non-Centrosomal Microtubule Arrays in <i>C. elegans</i>\u201d."

This approach did not work, as we were not able to generate clusters of comparable size/morphology to those observed for NOCA-1 or Patronin. We also took the reviewers\u2019 suggestion and tried to transiently expressed mRuby fused NOCA-1 in a U2OS cell line that stably expresses GFP labeled tubulin.

There is a clear loss of non-centrosomal arrays in the epidermis upon loss of NOCA-1 and Ptrn-1, though the actual functions of each one are still unclear (and the arrays are fine upon loss of NOCA-1 alone). In the other tissues, no data was given to show that non-centrosomal microtubule arrays were in fact disrupted and that NOCA-1 wasn't required for the proper dynamics of these structures rather than their formation and or organization. Thus, this seems to be based largely on the way that others have thought about ninein function in mammalian cells.

The microtubule array in the larval <i>epidermis</i> is particularly suitable for analysis of the effect of protein inhibition on array structure and microtubule dynamics, since the overall structure of the tissue remains relatively constant upon depletion of one or both proteins, and we have now also been able to build a system to specifically knockdown an essential\u03b3\u2013tubulin complex component after differentiation in this tissue (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Due to these experimental advantages, the larval <i>epidermis</i> is our \u201cflagship\u201d array that we describe in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1-3</a>. In this array, inhibition of PTRN-1 alone does not appear to substantially alter microtubule dynamics, whereas NOCA-1 inhibition leads to a more stable microtubule array with substantially fewer growing microtubule ends that grow at a reduced rate (now shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2 and 3</a>). Based on these results, we conclude that both NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 are involved in the generation of microtubules in the larval epidermal array and that the presence of NOCA-1 significantly alters the dynamics of microtubules within this array."

For clarity, we have added schematics and immunofluorescence images of this array in control worms (new panels in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). These arrays hold the meiotic nuclei in juxtaposition to the cell surface within the compartments, which are open on one side to a cytoplasmic channel called the rachis that runs down the center of the germline, to prevent them from falling into the rachis. Within the rachis there are also a large number of microtubules that flow with the streaming cytoplasm into the forming oocytes. How these microtubules are related to the arrays within the compartments is not entirely clear. When we delete NOCA-1 or deplete \u03b3-tubulin, all of the nuclei fall out of their compartments and cluster in the rachis, indicating a dramatic failure in the function of the compartment microtubule arrays. This nuclear fallout is coupled to degeneration of compartment structure (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Thus, unlike the situation in the larval <i>epidermis</i>, the fact that compartments with normal structure cease to exist as the microtubule arrays fail and the nuclei fall into the rachis, makes it impossible to do a proper \u201cbefore and after\u201d comparison to assess the impact of loss of NOCA-1 and \u03b3-tubulin on the structure of the compartment arrays and the dynamics of their constituent microtubules. As a proxy, we examine the effect on the number of growing microtubule ends in the rachis (the only structure that exists before and after the inhibitions) and we observe that comet density is reduced \u223c 2-fold by NOCA-1 or \u03b3-tubulin inhibition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). From this, we can conclude that NOCA-1 and \u03b3-tubulin are required to assemble/maintain functional microtubule arrays in the germline compartments. We now discuss the limitations of this tissue with respect to analyzing changes in microtubule organization and dynamics within the compartment arrays in the text."

As we explain in the legend to this figure, the homology between nematode NOCA-1 homologs and vertebrate nineins was discovered in an NCBI blast using the conserved region of NOCA-1 from <i>Brugia malayi</i> as the query. In our experience, blasting using the <i>Brugia</i> sequence is one of the best ways to identify non-nematode homologs of <i>C. elegans</i> proteins, since <i>Brugia</i> sequences tend to be among the least divergent among nematode species. The blast using the <i>Brugia</i> sequence identified all of the nematode NOCA-1 homologs (new <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>, red, pink, and green text), along with the vertebrate <i>Chinchilla lanigera</i>, <i>Heterocephalus glaber</i> and <i>Fukomys damrensis</i> nineins (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>, black and blue text), with no other significant hits. Importantly, reverse blast of aa 1549\u20131801 of <i>Chinchilla lanigera</i> ninein isoform X4 against all nematode sequences (new <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1C</a>) yielded <i>Brugia malayi</i> NOCA-1 as the top hit (E value = 2e-07) and Loa loa NOCA-1 as the second hit (E value = 2e-04).

These data suggest that NOCA-1 is indeed more similar to ninein than to other coiled coiled proteins.
