However, signal information will be lost unless it can be reliably decoded by downstream genes. To understand the limits on dynamic information transduction, we apply information theory to quantify how much gene expression information the yeast TF Msn2 can transduce to target genes in the amplitude or frequency of its activation dynamics. We find that although the amount of information transmitted by Msn2 to single target genes is limited, information transduction can be increased by modulating promoter <i>cis</i>-elements or by integrating information from multiple genes. By correcting for extrinsic noise, we estimate an upper bound on information transduction. Overall, we find that information transduction through amplitude and frequency regulation of Msn2 is limited to error-free transduction of signal identity, but not signal intensity information."

However, signal information will be lost unless it can be reliably decoded by downstream genes. To understand the limits on dynamic information transduction, we apply information theory to quantify how much gene expression information the yeast TF Msn2 can transduce to target genes in the amplitude or frequency of its activation dynamics. We find that although the amount of information transmitted by Msn2 to single target genes is limited, information transduction can be increased by modulating promoter <i>cis</i>-elements or by integrating information from multiple genes. By correcting for extrinsic noise, we estimate an upper bound on information transduction. Overall, we find that information transduction through amplitude and frequency regulation of Msn2 is limited to error-free transduction of signal identity, but not signal intensity information."

Akin to p53, the yeast multi-stress response TF Msn2 exhibits short pulses of nuclear localization with intensity-dependent frequency under glucose limitation, but sustained nuclear localization with intensity-dependent amplitude under oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hao and O'Shea, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Jacquet et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Petrenko et al., 2013</a>). Thus, p53 and Msn2 dynamics encode both signal identity and signal intensity. Beyond p53 and Msn2, amplitude- or frequency encoding of signal identity and intensity information is conserved throughout eukaryotic signaling pathways (see also <a href=\"#bib8\">Berridge et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Werner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Warmflash et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Albeck et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aoki et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Imayoshi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dalal et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Harima et al., 2014</a>).

Signal identity is encoded in the type of TF dynamics: a sustained pulse (signal A) or nuclear pulsing (signal B). Signal intensity (e.g., ligand concentration) is encoded in the amplitude for signal A, but in the frequency for signal B. Different dynamical patterns of TF activation can activate distinct, but specific, downstream gene expression programs. (<b>B</b>) Applying an information theoretic framework to cell signaling, a gene promoter can be considered a channel. A graded population-level dose\u2013response belies the complexity of the single-cell response: it shows the mean expression at points a, b, c, and d, but not the width or variance of their distributions. (<b>C</b>) Two extreme models. In the \u2018rheostat model\u2019, signal intensity information encoded in the frequency or amplitude of a TF leads to non-overlapping gene expression distributions (a, b, c, and d).

This is important because the capacity of any signaling pathway for information transduction is limited by the capacity of its weakest node or bottleneck (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cover and Thomas, 2006</a>). Thus, even though information can reliably be encoded in TF activation dynamics (<a href=\"#bib58\">Selimkhanov et al., 2014</a>), this information will be lost unless genes can reliably decode it. We therefore focus on the response of single genes and ask: can cells reliably transmit both signal identity and intensity information in the amplitude and frequency of TFs to target genes in the presence of biochemical noise? In other words, what are the limits on amplitude- and frequency-mediated information transduction? We investigate this by applying tools from information theory to quantify how much of the information (in bits) encoded in the amplitude and frequency of a TF can be transmitted through gene promoters to fine-tune the gene expression level."

Mutual information quantifies how much information an output can carry about an input across a noisy channel (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Mathematically, information is quantified in bits: to resolve two different signal intensities without error requires at least 1 bit of information, to resolve four different signal intensities without error requires at least 2 bits of information and so forth. However, 1 bit of information does not guarantee that two intensities can be distinguished without error. Similarly, 1 bit may allow multiple intensities to be distinguished, albeit with some associated error (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bowsher and Swain, 2014</a>). As an example of how information theory can be applied, consider a dose\u2013response relationship (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). A graded population-level dose\u2013response can belie the complexity of the single-cell response (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ferrell and Machleder, 1998</a>). For example, if different TF amplitudes or frequencies lead to distinguishable gene expression outputs (points a, b, c and d), signal intensity information is accurately transmitted and the cell can fine-tune the expression of stress genes to the stress intensity like a \u2018rheostat\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, rheostat model). However, biochemical noise can degrade signal information: if gene expression outputs are no longer resolvable, the cell can no longer fine-tune the expression level of stress genes to stress intensity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, noisy switch model). In the noisy switch model, the cell can distinguish no stimulus (point a, OFF) from maximal stimulus (point d, ON)\u2014but intermediate stimuli (points b and c) cannot reliably be distinguished based on the gene expression output and signal intensity information has been lost (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Information theory provides a framework for capturing and quantifying these differences. Thus, we can distinguish these two models by measuring information transduction by promoters: the noisy switch model requires \u223c1 bit, whereas the rheostat model requires substantially higher mutual information."

However, despite gene expression being the final bottleneck in cell signaling, gene expression has received little attention (<a href=\"#bib70\">Uda et al., 2013</a>). Estimating an upper limit on the information transduction capacity of a gene has not previously been possible due to extrinsic noise: even when studying genetically identical single cells, the cells can exhibit non-genetic differences, that is, in cell cycle phase or variability in TF concentration, which means the measured mutual information will be an underestimate (<a href=\"#bib24\">Elowitz et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Toettcher et al., 2013</a>).

We find that Msn2 target genes can transduce just over 1 bit of information, consistent with the \u2018noisy switch model\u2019. Although individual Msn2 target genes can only transduce little information, we illustrate how the cell can improve information transduction capacity by modulating promoter <i>cis-</i>elements, by integrating the response of more than one gene, or by having multiple copies of the same gene. We show that more information can be transduced through amplitude than through frequency modulation (FM) of Msn2 activation dynamics. Nevertheless, while previous studies have shown that significant amounts of information can be encoded in TF activation dynamics (<a href=\"#bib58\">Selimkhanov et al., 2014</a>), we find that noise in the decoding step severely limits information transduction. Specifically, our results indicate that information about signal identity, but not signal intensity, can be transmitted nearly without error in the amplitude and frequency of Msn2 and decoded by Msn2-responsive promoters."

With this setup (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), we can control and measure the amplitude and frequency of activation of an Msn2-mCherry fusion protein over time and generate single-cell traces that mimic the natural Msn2 dynamics under oxidative stress (a sustained nuclear pulse with signal intensity\u2013dependent amplitude; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and glucose limitation (short pulses with signal intensity\u2013dependent frequency; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hao and O'Shea, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Petrenko et al., 2013</a>). To measure stress-relevant gene expression, we use dual cyan and yellow fluorescent protein (CFP/YFP) reporters and focus on two specific Msn2 target genes: <i>HXK1</i>, which is induced under glucose limitation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Herrero et al., 1995</a>) and <i>SIP18</i>, which is induced in response to oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib56\">Rodriguez-Porrata et al., 2012</a>). Using this setup, we have previously shown that, at the population level, individual genes differentially decode Msn2 dynamics (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hansen and O'Shea, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hao and O'Shea, 2012</a>): oscillatory Msn2 activation induces gene class B (e.g., <i>HXK1</i>) without inducing gene class A (e.g., <i>SIP18</i>), whereas sustained Msn2 activation preferentially induces gene class A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Thus, this represents an ideal setup for studying promoter decoding of Msn2 dynamics in single cells, which enables us to quantify information transduction."

To visualize and quantify the subcellular localization of Msn2 it was C-terminally tagged with the red fluorescent protein mCherry. A nuclear protein, NHP6a, was C-terminally tagged with iRFP, an infrared fluorescent protein (<a href=\"#bib26\">Filonov et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hansen and O'Shea, 2013</a>), to visualize the nucleus for segmentation purposes. All three catalytic subunits of Protein Kinase A (PKA) were mutated to contain an analogue-sensitive M\u2192G mutation (<i>TPK1</i><sup>M164G</sup> <i>TPK2</i><sup>M147G</sup> <i>TPK3</i><sup>M165G</sup>). These mutations render all three PKA subunits sensitive to the small molecule 1-NM-PP1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bishop et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hao and O'Shea, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zaman et al., 2009</a>). Thus, when 1-NM-PP1 is added, PKA is inhibited, Msn2-mCherry is no longer phosphorylated by PKA, Msn2-mCherry therefore gets dephosphorylated, and translocates into the nucleus where it can bind to and activate target genes. To visualize gene expression, the ORFs of target genes were replaced with YFP (mCitrineV163A) and CFP (SCFP3A) on homologues chromosomes in diploid cells, as it has been described previously (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hansen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hansen and O'Shea, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kremers et al., 2006</a>). The inhibitor, 1-NM-PP1 is shown on the right and its synthesis has been described previously (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hansen and O'Shea, 2013</a>). (<b>B</b>) An illustration of how the YFP histograms are obtained for each condition. For a specific amplitude or frequency, the response of \u223c1000 cells is measured (only \u223c300 cells shown here for ease of visualization). For each single cell time-trace, a moving average smoothing filter is applied to remove any technical noise and the maximal YFP value is determined after the trace has reached a plateau. This is repeated for all single cells and a YFP histogram is generated by binning. The procedure is then repeated for all the Msn2 conditions (e.g., the no input and all the AM conditions) to generate a full single-cell dose\u2013response (right). These data are then used to calculate the maximal mutual information with respect to amplitude modulation, <i>I</i><sub>AM</sub>. (<b>C</b>) Promoter nucleosome occupancy maps. The upstream promoter region (\u2212800 to 0 bp from ATG site) is shown for each promoter. Msn2 binding sites (STRE 5\u2032-CCCCT-3\u2032) are shown in red triangles and nucleosome occupancy data (grey) are from (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hansen and O'Shea, 2013</a>). The <i>SIP18</i> promoter has three Msn2 binding sites. The most upstream site is seemingly non-functional\u2014removing it does not affect gene induction. The two sites (close to \u2212400 bp) are required\u2014removing these two sites abolishes gene induction. <i>pSIP18</i> mut A and mut B have three and four new binding sites, respectively, in between the two nucleosomes close to the transcription start site. (<b>D</b>) Dynamic range and noise. Removing the two WT Msn2 binding sites and replacing them with three or four binding sites, respectively, substantially increases the dynamic range (defined as the response to a 70 min pulse at 3 \u03bcM 1-NM-PP1). How the total (red), intrinsic (blue) and extrinsic (green) noise scales with the Msn2 amplitude (for a 70 min pulse; top) or the frequency (at 690 nM 1-NM-PP1; bottom) for all four promoters is shown. The y-axis scale is different in each case."

Controlling measurement noise is important, because high measurement noise will cause measurements of mutual information to be underestimates. To minimize effects of measurement noise coming from, for example, improper focusing by the microscope, autofluorescence and camera noise, slight errors in cell segmentation and other sources, multiple YFP measurements are made. For each single cell, the YFP level is measured 64 times at 2.5 min time resolution. In general, measurement noise is modest at very low YFP expression\u2014in part due to cellular autofluorescence\u2014but negligible at high YFP expression.

Information loss comes from two sources: gene-intrinsic and gene-extrinsic noise (<a href=\"#bib24\">Elowitz et al., 2002</a>). Intrinsic noise originates from the inherently stochastic nature of biochemical reactions, such as stochastic binding of Msn2 at individual promoters. Information loss due to intrinsic noise is therefore unavoidable for the cell. Extrinsic noise comes from the intracellular environment, which may differ between cells in a population. Even though we consider genetically identical cells grown in a microfluidic chemostat, the cell population could exhibit non-genetic differences in cell-cycle phase and Msn2 abundance or dynamics, etc. This could cause the dose\u2013response to be different between single cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), as was observed in a recent study on Ras/ERK signaling (<a href=\"#bib67\">Toettcher et al., 2013</a>). For example, a cell with a higher-than-average Msn2 abundance might show higher gene expression. When we carefully quantify Msn2-mCherry dynamics, we observe loss of information between the microfluidic 1-NM-PP1 input and nuclear Msn2 due to variability in Msn2 abundance between cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Msn2 is a low-abundance protein: there are only a few hundred molecules in each cell (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</a>). Therefore, precisely measuring Msn2 abundance is challenging. Furthermore, the nucleus moves in and out of focus during time-lapse acquisition. To estimate the variation in Msn2 abundance, cells (<i>pSIP18</i> mut B) were grown in the microfluidic device and exposed to a 70-min pulse of either 0, 100 nM, 175 nM, 275 nM, 413 nM, 690 nM, 1117 nM or 3 \u03bcM 1-NM-PP1. Msn2-mCherry nuclear localization was measured using a 5-frame z-stack series of 0, \u00b11.2 \u03bcm, \u00b1 2.4 \u03bcm above and below the focal plane using a 500 ms exposure time and imaging every 10 min. Msn2-mCherry fluorescence was corrected for photobleaching. We collected two frames before and after 1-NM-PP1 exposure to calculate the baseline level of Msn2 before 1-NM-PP1 treatment. In (<b>A</b>), we show the mean and standard deviation for each timepoint for each concentration. (<b>B</b>) To calculate mutual information between 1-NM-PP1 input and Msn2-mCherry dynamics, we use the data from (<b>A</b>) and calculate <i>I</i><sub>AM</sub>(1-NM-PP1; Msn2) = 2.06 \u00b1 0.03 bits. We quantify Msn2-mCherry localization in absolute units as the mean nuclear Msn2 level across the seven measurements while Msn2 is nuclear\u2014this also corresponds to the total time-integrated nuclear level of Msn2 (Msn2 \u2018Area Under the Curve\u2019 or AUC). In total, we measured 2996 single cells. Using Msn2 variability in response to 3 \u03bcM 1-NM-PP1, we estimate the cell-to-cell variability of Msn2 to be CV\u223c15%. However, given measurement noise we stress that CV\u223c15% and <i>I</i>\u223c2.06 bits are likely over- and underestimates, respectively. Note that Msn2 is a low abundance protein (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</a>). Previous proteomic studies showed that essentially no yeast proteins have CV&lt;10% (<a href=\"#bib50\">Newman et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, Msn2 is among the least variable low abundance proteins in yeast. (<b>C</b>) This figure is plotted using data from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> for <i>HXK1</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hansen and O'Shea, 2015</a>). In red is shown the input and in black is shown traces from 10 representative single cells. We did not do a finely spaced z-stack series for this experiment, which is necessary to accurately quantify the concentration of Msn2 in the nucleus\u2014this causes too much photobleaching to be compatible with imaging at reasonable temporal resolution (2.5 min here). Nonetheless, as can be seen, the black traces faithfully track the input with limited noise. For each cell plotted above, we also measured <i>hxk1</i>::CFP and <i>hxk1</i>::YFP gene expression. (<b>D</b>) To accurately quantify Msn2-mCherry dynamics during FM input, we acquired a finely spaced z-stack series at high time-resolution (1 min). This causes too high photobleaching to be compatible with sustained time-lapse imaging. Therefore, we are only able to collect data at this resolution for a single 5-min pulse. The mean (black dots) and standard deviation (error bars) for 132 single cells (<i>pSIP18</i> mut B) are shown. As can be seen, Msn2-mCherry accurately tracks the microfluidic 1-NM-PP1 input with limited noise also during FM input. In a population of cells, Msn2 translocates to the nucleus in every single cell during 1-NM-PP1 exposure. (<b>F</b>) To calculate mutual information between 1-NM-PP1 input and Msn2-mCherry dynamics, we use the data from (<b>D</b>) and estimate <i>I</i><sub>FM</sub>(1-NM-PP1; Msn2) = 2.23 \u00b1 0.03 bits. Given measurement noise, this is likely an underestimate. We quantify Msn2-mCherry localization in absolute units as the total nuclear Msn2 level across the ten measurements while Msn2 is nuclear (five during the pulse, five after the pulse)\u2014this also corresponds to the total time-integrated nuclear level of Msn2 (Msn2 \u2018Area Under the Curve\u2019 or AUC). With data from (<b>D</b>), we measure the distribution of cell-to-cell variability for a single 5-min pulse. To calculate <i>I</i><sub>FM</sub>, we then extrapolate by multiplying the AUC probability distribution by the pulse number of each experiment since Msn2 tracks the 1-NM-PP1 input as faithfully for the first pulse as for the subsequent pulses. Ideally, one would measure the Msn2 AUC at 1-min time resolution and with finely spaced z-stacks throughout the entire time-lapse experiment, but this is not technically possible due to photobleaching."

By having two gene expression reporters in diploid cells on homologous chromosomes that differ only by their color (CFP and YFP) but share the same intracellular environment, the extent to which they co-vary in the same cell allows us to infer how much gene-extrinsic factors, such as cell-cycle phase and Msn2 variability, and so on. contribute altogether (extrinsic noise), without having to specify each factor. Or phrased differently, if the dose\u2013response is shifted in a cell, both the CFP and YFP reporter will be affected in a correlated manner and their covariance allows us to quantify this (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Therefore, we developed an algorithm that uses the CFP/YFP covariance to estimate what the intrinsic <i>I</i> (<i>I</i><sub>int</sub>) would have been in the absence of extrinsic noise. Briefly, our algorithm takes the following steps (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>): First, the raw YFP histogram is fitted to a gamma distribution (<math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><mtext>YFP</mtext><mo>\u223c</mo><mi>\u0393</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>).

Fourth, this is repeated for each Msn2 input (e.g., amplitude or frequency). Finally, this inferred data set is discretized and then used to estimate <i>I</i><sub>int</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; see <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> for a detailed discussion of the algorithm). We verified our algorithm in silico by systematically simulating five linear and five non-linear gene expression models with and without extrinsic noise and compared the true <i>I</i><sub>int</sub> to the algorithm-inferred <i>I</i><sub>int</sub>.

To test this we generated diploid strains with either one (1\u00d7) or two (2\u00d7) copies of the <i>hxk1</i>::CFP and <i>sip18</i>::YFP reporters in the same cell."

As a conceptual framework, we introduce two extreme models of information transmission (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>): in the \u2018noisy switch model\u2019, the cell only transmits information sufficient to turn ON or OFF particular genes or pathways in response to external signals or stresses, whereas in the \u2018rheostat model\u2019 the cell is accurately fine-tuning the expression levels of relevant genes to the intensity of a signal or stress. For a TF responding to multiple stresses, we can extend this framework beyond a single gene. Extending the noisy switch model to two genes, the stress-relevant gene <i>HXK1</i> is reliably induced during FM pulsing of Msn2 (as seen under glucose limitation), whereas both <i>HXK1</i> and the stress-relevant <i>SIP18</i> gene are reliably induced during AM activation of Msn2 (as seen under oxidative stress) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Therefore, three inputs (no input, FM, or AM) can be distinguished essentially without error (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). However, given the modest joint information transduction capacities with respect to AM and FM combined (<i>I</i><sub>AM+FM,joint</sub>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), the cell cannot fine-tune <i>HXK1</i> and <i>SIP18</i> expression levels without significant error to the stress intensity. Thus, signal identity information for two distinct stresses can be transduced in the amplitude and frequency of Msn2 essentially without error, but intensity information can only be transduced with high error."

One possibility is that the stochasticity inherent in the biophysical process of transcription fundamentally constrains information transduction by a promoter to \u223c1.0\u20131.3 bit. However, since the information transduction capacity of <i>SIP18</i> can be substantially increased by modulating promoter <i>cis</i>-elements (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a>), the low <i>I</i> of natural Msn2 target genes is not solely due to inherent biophysical constraints. Another speculative possibility is that variability is selected for: since evolutionary selection works at the population-level, variability in gene expression can create phenotypic diversity within an isogenic population (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balaban et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Blake et al., 2006</a>).

This question has not previously been experimentally addressed for TFs responding to multiple signals in an amplitude- or frequency-dependent manner. We show that more gene expression information can be transduced through the amplitude than through the frequency of Msn2 activation dynamics for all genes studied here (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a>). Although the FM dose-responses tend to be more linear, the AM dose-responses have higher dynamic range and lower noise (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). While we show that gene promoters have higher information transduction capacities for amplitude- than frequency-encoded information (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a>), maximal information transduction can be achieved for TFs that exhibit both amplitude- and frequency-encoding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Indeed, the gene expression response to a transient signal is noisier than a response at steady-state (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hansen and O'Shea, 2013</a>) and inducible genes tend to show higher expression noise (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bar-Even et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Newman et al., 2006</a>). One way the cell can improve information transduction is by integrating the response of more than one gene or by having multiple copies of a gene (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). An example of this is ribosome biogenesis where, by having multiple copies of each gene encoding a subunit and employing elaborate feedback control, the cell can fine-tune its translational capability to its growth and energy status (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lempiainen and Shore, 2009</a>). Another example is morphogen or cytokine secretion: although the amount produced by each single cell might be noisy, the average amount produced by a large number of cells can be highly precise (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gregor et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cheong et al., 2011</a>).

We show that the information transduction capacity of a gene can be tuned in <i>cis</i> and the amount of information transmitted increased by integrating the response of multiple genes. Nonetheless, for individual genes our results are consistent with the Msn2 pathway transmitting essentially error-free signal identity information, but unreliable signal intensity information, and therefore functioning more like a \u2018noisy switch\u2019 than a \u2018rheostat\u2019. Since many similar master regulators, such as p53, NF-\u03baB, ERK, and Hes1, also transduce information through the regulation of signaling dynamics, it will be interesting to investigate whether dynamic cell signaling is generally limited to error-free transduction of only signal identity information."

Briefly, yeast cells were grown overnight at 30\u00b0C with shaking at 180 rpm to an OD<sub>600 nm</sub> of ca. 0.1 in low fluorescence medium, quickly collected by suction filtration, loaded into the five channels of a microfluidic device pretreated with concanavalin A and the setup mounted on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with an Evolve EM-CCD camera (Photometrics, Tuscon, AZ), 63\u00d7 oil-immersion objective (NA 1.4, Plan-Apochromat), Zeiss Colibri LEDs for excitation and an incubation chamber kept at 30\u00b0C. Solenoid valves programmed using custom-written software (MATLAB) control whether medium with or without 1-NM-PP1 is delivered to each microfluidic channel and the flow (ca. 1 \u03bcL/s) is driven by gravity. Control of 1-NM-PP1 delivery enables the control of Msn2 pulsing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and a unique pulse sequence can be delivered to each of the five microfluidic channels. The microscope maintains focus and moves between each channel to acquire phase-contrast, YFP, CFP, RFP (mCherry), and iRFP images for 64 frames with a 2.5 min time resolution. For the AM experiments, 1-NM-PP1 was added to each microfluidic channel for 70 min at the following concentrations: 100 nM, 175 nM, 275 nM, 413 nM, 690 nM, 1117 nM, 3 \u03bcM. For the FM experiments, a concentration of 690 nM 1-NM-PP1 was used together with the following pulse sequences: one 5-min pulse; two 5-min pulses separated by a 40-min interval; three 5-min pulses separated by 25-min intervals; four 5-min pulses separated by 17.5-min intervals; five 5-min pulses separated by 13-min intervals; six 5-min pulses separated by 10-min intervals; seven 5-min pulses separated by 7.86-min intervals; eight 5-min pulses separated by 6.25-min intervals; nine 5-min pulses separated by 5-min intervals. Control software for the microfluidic device and a full protocol are provided elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hansen et al., 2015</a>). Image analysis was performed using custom-written software (MATLAB) that segments, tracks and quantifies single-cell time-traces and has been described previously (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hansen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hansen and O'Shea, 2013</a>).

To control and minimize effects of noise, the following data processing pipeline was employed. For each single-cell, a time-trace of 64 YFP measurements is made (2.5 min interval). The fluorescence (in AU) is the mean pixel-intensity per cell corresponding to the YFP concentration. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> from the single-cell YFP traces, YFP concentration generally reaches a plateau around or after the 100 min time-point (element 43 in the YFP vector). So the maximal YFP level in the cell is measured approximately 20 times before the experiment ends (element 64 in the YFP vector). Although there is slight noise in each measurement of the YFP concentration as shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> (black circles), because YFP is independently measured \u223c20 times after it has reached a plateau, the actual YFP level can accurately be determined by smoothing (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, red line). The YFP trace is smoothed using an 11-point moving average filter and the vector is subsequently converted to a scalar by taking the maximal YFP value in the (33;64) range of elements. The scalar YFP concentration (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) is used for all information theoretical calculations. We believe that the protein concentration is the most biologically relevant measure of gene expression. For example, the activity of a stress response enzyme is generally determined by its concentration. But we note that had a different measure been used, that is, had the dynamics of the YFP time-trace been included, different estimates of <i>I</i> would be obtained (see also <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> for a further discussion)."

This provides high confidence in the measurements and shows that the measurements are robust between different clones. Nonetheless, a constant noise source would cause all measurements to be underestimates by similar amounts. Therefore, the consistency of the measurements does not exclude the presence of a constant noise source. However, it is also important to note that most noise sources are \u2018extrinsic\u2019 to the gene and will therefore partially be filtered out by the algorithm during the correction for extrinsic noise."

I discuss two key concerns related to overstatements and over simplistic interpretation below. I made two suggestions that are constructive, but not essential. The first is for an additional analysis that I think could improve the paper and is easy to do and therefore I strongly recommend it will be performed. The second require additional experiment and while I think it would improve the paper substantially but might be outside the scope of this work and I do not see them as essential as long as the statements made by the authors are appropriately toned down."

They analyze the mutual information between microfluidics input class and gene expression. Therefore they make an implicit assumption that the information transmission between microfluidics class and the patterns of MSN-2 is \u201cnoise free\u201d and that all the information loss is in the decoding MSN2=&gt;YFP. However, in their 2013 MSB paper, the authors showed non-negligible variability in MSN-2-mCherry localization within their microfluidics setup. Furthermore, other factors could contribute to this such as the variation in MSN2-mCherry between cells. There are two ways to address this issue. The best way will be to repeat the experiments when measuring both MSN-2-mCherry localization and gene expression in the same cells and to calculate the MI between all steps in the pathway similar to <a href=\"#bib70\">Uda et al. 2013</a>. However, this might require substantial new experiments that are potentially beyond the scope of this work. The second best way is to just show the mutual information between the inputs and MSN-2 dynamics (in absolute units to address MSN2-mCherry concentration variability issues). If this value is close to 3 (log2(8)) than the assumption that the input noise is negligible is justified is reasonable, otherwise the information loss could be in the \u201csignaling\u201d or the response . They should have at least some of the required for this in their MSB 2013 paper. If there is substantial information loss between microfluidics and MSN2 response then I must recommend that the paper be rejected and more experiment done to carefully analyze loss at different steps along the artificial \u201cpathway\u201d."

Additionally, the authors showed that integration of multiple target promoters enhances information transduction. Overall, I really like the information-theoretical analysis of signal transduction. While the conclusions presented are not overly exciting, i.e. there are limits on information processing through Msn2 dynamics, the experiments and analysis presented in this work opens up a new and interesting way of understanding single-cell signaling dynamics in general."

In this manuscript, the authors focused on the decoding step, i.e., from Msn2 dynamics to promoter output. In all the analysis, the authors have assumed that Msn2 dynamics always follows the input chemical signal in every cell and thus the input TF signal equates the external chemical waveforms. However, I feel this assumption could present a fundamental problem in the analysis since it is hard to imagine that every cell in the population has the same Msn2 dynamics under a defined chemical waveform. More specifically, the distribution of responses (YFP level) could likely arise from the heterogeneous Msn2 dynamics among a population. Therefore, I feel that uncoupling the heterogeneity of Msn2 dynamics seems necessary for understanding how Msn2 dynamics contribute to the extent of information transduction."

For example, Msn2 may not follow the FM chemical signal as faithfully as the AM chemical signal. Thus, Msn2 dynamics could be more heterogeneous among cells in FM condition than in AM condition, leading to a more faithful signal transmission for AM. One might need to compare the variability in Msn2 response between AM and FM in order to study the role of Msn2 dynamics in the extent of information transmission in these conditions."

We quantified Msn2 nuclear localization in absolute units as the average nuclear level during the 70-min pulse. This also corresponds to the Msn2 AUC. The result is shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>. However, Msn2 is a low abundance protein present at only a few hundred molecules per cell. Therefore, to measure the difference between 25% and 37.5% of maximal nuclear localization (100 nM vs. 175 nM 1-NM-PP1), our measurement precision has to be on the order of tens of molecules. This is challenging even with state-of-the-art equipment. Therefore, our measurements likely slightly overestimate variability in nuclear Msn2-mCherry."

Therefore, the joint <i>I</i>(CFP,YFP) corresponds to reducing intrinsic noise by adding one extra promoter copy, which is the same as what we did in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> when we compare the 1x and 2x reporter diploids. Thus, the joint <i>I</i>(CFP,YFP) can provide an independent confirmation of the 1x vs. 2x reporter comparison in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>."

In this manuscript, the authors focused on the decoding step, i.e., from Msn2 dynamics to promoter output. In all the analysis, the authors have assumed that Msn2 dynamics always follows the input chemical signal in every cell and thus the input TF signal equates the external chemical waveforms. However, I feel this assumption could present a fundamental problem in the analysis since it is hard to imagine that every cell in the population has the same Msn2 dynamics under a defined chemical waveform. More specifically, the distribution of responses (YFP level) could likely arise from the heterogeneous Msn2 dynamics among a population.

Thus, Msn2 dynamics could be more heterogeneous among cells in FM condition than in AM condition, leading to a more faithful signal transmission for AM.

Since mutual information is a symmetric quantity, one could bin the promoter response into 8 or 16 bins.

As mentioned in our previous letter, suggestion 2 is technically challenging for two reasons. First, the nucleus moves in-and-out of focus during time-lapse acquisition which makes accurate quantification challenging. Second, to partially overcome this problem, z-stack images through the nucleus must be acquired, which causes high photobleaching and makes time-lapse imaging challenging. For example, to accurately quantify Msn2-dynamics during FM, it is necessary to image with 1-min time resolution and perform a finely-spaced z-stack series with long exposure times (as performed in new <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1D</a>). However, such intense imaging causes too severe photobleaching within 20-25 frames to enable accurate quantification Therefore, measurement noise in nuclear Msn2-mCherry quantification makes the suggested approach challenging."
