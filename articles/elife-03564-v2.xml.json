Using cell-specific inducible gene recombination in mice we found that, in the postnatal inner ear, Bbnf and Ntf3 are required for the formation and maintenance of hair cell ribbon synapses in the vestibular and cochlear epithelia, respectively. We also show that supporting cells in these epithelia are the key endogenous source of the neurotrophins. Using a new hair cell CreER<sup>T</sup> line with mosaic expression, we also found that Ntf3's effect on cochlear synaptogenesis is highly localized. Moreover, supporting cell-derived Ntf3, but not Bbnf, promoted recovery of cochlear function and ribbon synapse regeneration after acoustic trauma. These results indicate that glial-derived neurotrophins play critical roles in inner ear synapse density and synaptic regeneration after injury."

Using cell-specific inducible gene recombination in mice we found that, in the postnatal inner ear, Bbnf and Ntf3 are required for the formation and maintenance of hair cell ribbon synapses in the vestibular and cochlear epithelia, respectively. We also show that supporting cells in these epithelia are the key endogenous source of the neurotrophins. Using a new hair cell CreER<sup>T</sup> line with mosaic expression, we also found that Ntf3's effect on cochlear synaptogenesis is highly localized. Moreover, supporting cell-derived Ntf3, but not Bbnf, promoted recovery of cochlear function and ribbon synapse regeneration after acoustic trauma. These results indicate that glial-derived neurotrophins play critical roles in inner ear synapse density and synaptic regeneration after injury."

Some hearing loss can be attributed to the death of hair cells in a part of the inner ear called the cochlea. When sound waves hit the cochlea, they cause the fluid inside it to vibrate: the hair cells detect these vibrations and convert them into electrical signals that are sent along neurons to the brain. However, vibrations that are too strong can destroy hair cells."

Studies of the cochlea revealed that the extra neurotrophin-3 had boosted the regeneration of synapses damaged by the noise."

Both Bdnf and Ntf3 continue to be expressed in inner ear sensory epithelia after birth. In the postnatal vestibular epithelia, Bdnf is expressed only by supporting cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schecterson and Bothwell, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Montcouquiol et al., 1998</a>), whereas Ntf3 is expressed by both supporting cells and hair cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Farinas et al., 1994</a>). In the postnatal organ of Corti, Bdnf is expressed by both inner (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) and supporting cells at early postnatal ages (P1\u2013P6), but is only detected in supporting cells from P10 onwards (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wiechers et al., 1999</a>). All cells in the early postnatal organ of Corti appear to express Ntf3, but in the adult, expression is restricted to the IHCs and their surrounding supporting cells, with higher levels in the apical (low-frequency) region than at the base of the cochlear spiral (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sugawara et al., 2007</a>). Thus Bdnf and Ntf3 could have significant functions in the postnatal inner ear, and alterations in expression of these neurotrophins may modulate structure and function in the adult inner ear."

We show that these neurotrophins, when expressed by the glia-like supporting cells in these sensory epithelia, are required for the formation and/or maintenance of ribbon synapses, a role distinct from the one they play in embryogenesis. Ntf3 has major effects only in the cochlea, while postnatal Bdnf appears to act only in the vestibular organs. Furthermore, we show that Ntf3 overexpression can elicit regeneration of the synaptic contacts between cochlear nerve terminals and inner hair cells after noise-induced synaptopathy, a type of neural damage which appears to be widespread even in ears exposed at sound levels well below those which cause hair cell damage and permanent threshold shifts (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</a>)."

This is not the case for the embryonic inner ear, where the loss of Ntf3 results in the loss of a subpopulation of vestibular neurons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ernfors et al., 1995</a>). In contrast, <i>Ntf3</i> knockout from supporting cells resulted in elevated thresholds for auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) at high frequencies, while supporting cell <i>Ntf3</i> overexpression resulted in reduced ABR thresholds at the same frequencies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were not affected by the abnormal Ntf3 expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), suggesting that the ABR changes were due to dysfunction of the inner hair cells (IHCs), the cochlear nerve fibers, or the synapses that connect them. Correspondingly, the amplitude of ABR peak 1 (P1), the summed activity of the cochlear nerve, was reduced by supporting cell <i>Ntf3</i> knockout and increased by overexpression, also at high frequencies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The latency of ABR P1 and the width of ABR wave 1 were not altered by the knockout or overexpression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>), suggesting that altering Ntf3 levels does not affect cochlear nerve myelination. Control mice carrying only the <i>Plp1/CreER</i><sup><i>T</i></sup> allele showed normal cochlear responses, proving that the phenotype was not due to the expression of the <i>CreER</i><sup><i>T</i></sup> transgene (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results demonstrate that supporting cell derived Ntf3 plays a critical role in normal physiology of the postnatal cochlea, specifically in the basal (high-frequency) regions."

Examination of plastic sections showed no obvious changes in the organ of Corti, the spiral ganglion, or accessory structures of the cochlear duct such as the stria vascularis, spiral ligament, etc. Quantitative analysis showed normal density of supporting cells and hair cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>) as well as peripheral axons of cochlear nerve fibers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D</a>). In contrast, analysis of immunostained whole-mounts of the organ of Corti revealed alterations in the numbers of synaptic contacts between inner hair cells (IHCs) and cochlear nerve terminals. Immunostaining of pre-synaptic ribbon and post-synaptic receptor patches, using antibodies against CtBP2 and GluA2, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), showed that supporting cell <i>Ntf3</i> knockout reduced the number of synaptic puncta (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; upper panels and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; blue), while overexpression increased synapse number (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; lower panels and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; red). Effects on synaptic counts were restricted to basal (high-frequency) cochlear regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), as seen for ABR thresholds and amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). Similar results were obtained when separately counting either pre-synaptic ribbons or post-synaptic receptor patches (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). The strong correlation between the changes in ABR amplitudes and synaptic counts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) suggests that levels of supporting cell-derived Ntf3 influence cochlear function by regulating the number of IHC ribbon synapses. Previous studies have suggested that alterations in ribbon synapses affect ABR responses by changing sound-evoked peak discharge rates (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davies, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Glowatzki et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gomez-Palacio-Schjetnan and Escobar, 2013</a>). Thus, increases (or decreases) in the number of synapses per fiber in <i>Ntf3</i> overexpressors or knockouts could increase (or decrease) the probability of synchronous EPSPs, thereby increasing (or decreasing) onset spike rate in response to tone pips and ultimately altering the amplitude of ABR P1, the summed activity of the cochlear nerve. The observation that Ntf3 overexpression can increase synapse density indicates that Ntf3 is normally expressed in limited amounts, as expected from the neurotrophic hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davies, 1996</a>)."

To determine if Ntf3 overexpression could either prevent, or promote recovery from, this noise-induced synaptic loss and attenuation of cochlear responses, we exposed control and <i>Ntf3</i> overexpressing mice to noise levels known to cause this type of neuropathy (8\u201316 kHz at 100 dB SPL for 2 hr) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</a>).

To test if Ntf3 overexpression after noise exposure enhances synaptic regeneration and functional recovery, we could not use the <i>Plp1/CreER</i><sup><i>T</i></sup> transgene, as this line does not produce effective recombination in cochlear supporting cells after P15 (data not shown). Therefore, we used a line expressing <i>CreER</i><sup><i>T</i></sup> under the control of the promoter for the glutamate aspartate transporter <i>Slc1a3</i> (<i>Slc1a3/CreER</i><sup><i>T</i></sup>) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). In the adult cochlea, Slc1a3 (GLAST) is expressed by inner phalangeal and inner border cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Furness and Lawton, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Glowatzki et al., 2006</a>), the same supporting cells that express Plp1 at early postnatal ages (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gomez-Casati et al., 2010a</a>). RT-qPCR showed that tamoxifen treatment in adult <i>Ntf3</i><sup><i>stop</i></sup><i>:Slc1a3/CreER</i><sup><i>T</i></sup> mice significantly increased cochlear Ntf3 expression as compared to controls lacking the Cre (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). <i>Ntf3</i><sup><i>stop</i></sup><i>:Slc1a3/CreER</i><sup><i>T</i></sup> mice and control mice were then subjected to acoustic trauma, followed immediately (&lt;1 hr) by tamoxifen treatment (AT/Tmx; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). As for mice injected with tamoxifen in the early postnatal period (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), controls and <i>Ntf3</i> overexpressors showed comparable loss and gradual recovery of ABR thresholds when tamoxifen was administered in adult mice immediately after noise exposure (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). In contrast, the recovery of ABR P1 amplitudes was significantly enhanced by Ntf3 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>).

A similar specificity in the biological roles of these neurotrophins has been shown in embryonic development, that is, constitutive knockout of <i>Bdnf</i> or <i>Ntf3</i> reveals predominant pro-survival roles on vestibular or cochlear neurons, respectively (<a href=\"#bib12\">Farinas et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jones et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ernfors et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Schimmang et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bianchi et al., 1996</a>). However, while genetic replacement of one neurotrophin with the other can almost completely rescue neuronal survival deficits caused by constitutive deletion of either <i>Bdnf</i> or <i>Ntf3</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Coppola et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agerman et al., 2003</a>), we observed that Ntf3 and Bdnf have distinct and non-overlapping roles in postnatal synapse formation. Thus, it appears that vestibular and auditory primary sensory neurons can respond equally to endogenous levels of either Bdnf or Ntf3 during development, but this ability is lost after birth."

While previous studies of constitutive knockouts showed that Ntf3 is necessary for the survival of a subpopulation of vestibular neurons during embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ernfors et al., 1995</a>), our data indicate that Ntf3, which like Bdnf is expressed primarily by supporting cells in the postnatal vestibular sensory epithelia (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sugawara et al., 2007</a>), is dispensable in the vestibular system after birth. In contrast to the vestibular organs, supporting cell-derived Ntf3, but not Bdnf, is necessary for the establishment of normal synapses and auditory function in the cochlear base. The correlation of Ntf3 expression levels with synapse numbers and cochlear sensitivity in both knockout and overexpression models indicates that supporting cell-derived Ntf3 is not only a critical but also a limiting factor in the postnatal cochlea."

These sensory neurons may become independent of trophic support in the adult, or alternatively, other trophic factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (Mif), may promote survival after birth. Both Igf1 and Mif are expressed in the postnatal cochlea, and, for both, loss results in ganglion cell death or altered innervation after birth (<a href=\"#bib6\">Camarero et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bank et al., 2012</a>). In addition, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf) is also expressed in postnatal inner ear (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stankovic and Corfas, 2003</a>), and it has been suggested that vestibular neurons switch trophic sensitivity from Bdnf to Gdnf after target innervation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hashino et al., 1999</a>)."

The lack of phenotype in the hair cell-specific <i>Ntf3</i> knockout is unlikely due to the partial recombination in hair cells because (a) recombination in supporting cells and IHCs had similar efficiency (\u223c60%); (b) cochlear Ntf3 expression was reduced to a similar extent by deletion from either supporting cells or hair cells; and (c) Ntf3 overexpression by hair cells had similar effects on cochlear function and synapse density as that seen in Ntf3 overexpression by supporting cells, indicating that modulation of Ntf3 expression in a subset of hair cells is sufficient to produce phenotypic outcomes. These observations support the conclusion that endogenous Ntf3 expressed by postnatal supporting cells, but not inner hair cells, is necessary for normal cochlear function."

Thus, it appears that supporting cells create a physical barrier, allowing for local signaling events without cross talk between adjacent hair cells. The lack of effect of postnatal <i>Ntf3</i> knockout or overexpression on the total number of myelinated sensory axons in the osseous spiral lamina indicates that the changes in synapses is not due to alterations in the number of sensory neurons, and thus it is consistent with the notion that the effects of Ntf3 are local.

Since the Ntf3 receptor Ntrk3 is expressed by cochlear neurons, not IHCs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gestwa et al., 1999</a>), our results suggest that Ntf3 overexpression acts first by promoting the recovery of post-synaptic terminals, which prevents the progressive loss of pre-synaptic ribbons, and enhances the regeneration of IHC synapses after noise exposure."

It has been suggested that these neurotrophins might promote long-term neuronal survival in cochlear implant users, who typically have few, if any, remaining hair cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Budenz et al., 2012</a>). Recent studies in mice have shown that significant synaptic loss precedes hair cell death and spiral ganglion cell degeneration in both noise-induced and age-related hearing loss (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sergeyenko et al., 2013</a>), and it has been suggested that this primary neuropathy is a major cause of problems hearing in a noisy environment, the most common complaint of those with sensorineural hearing loss. Therefore, treatment of cochlear synaptopathy presents a novel therapeutic approach for age-related and noise-induced hearing loss. While a number of trophic factors, including Bdnf and Ntf3, can mediate the survival of injured sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib37\">Roehm and Hansen, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ramekers et al., 2012</a>), our findings indicate that specific neurotrophins are required to promote regeneration and to regain function of the synaptic connections in damaged inner ear epithelia."

Cochleas (membranous labyrinths) and utricles (sensory epithelia) were dissected from temporal bones, and total RNA was purified using RNeasy spin-columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA from cochlea (200 ng) or utricle (50 ng) was reverse transcribed (RT) using an iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in 20 \u00b5l reaction with a mixture of oligo(dT) and random hexamer primers. The reverse transcription was performed at 42\u00b0C for 1 hr followed by 85\u00b0C for 5 min. Quantitative PCR was carried out on a CFX96 machine using an iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). For each well of the 96-well plate (Bio-Rad), the 20 \u03bcl reaction contained 10 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 iQ SYBR Green Supermix, 6 pmol of each forward and reverse primer, and 1 \u03bcl of cDNA sample. The cycling conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. Each sample was loaded in duplicates. The following forward (F) and reverse (R) primers were used: <i>Bdnf</i>, F: GTGTGTGACAGTATTAGCGAGTGG, R: GATACCGGGACTTTCTCTAGGAC, which generates a 101 bp amplicon; <i>Ntf3</i>, F: GCCCCCTCCCTTATACCTAATG, R: CATAGCGTTTCCTCCGTGGT, which generate an 83 bp amplicon; and <i>Rpl19</i>, F: ACCTGGATGAGAAGGATGAG, R: ACCTTCAGGTACAGGCTGTG, which generates a 101 bp amplicon. Expression levels of Bdnf and Ntf3 were normalized to the reference housekeeping gene Rpl19 in the same samples. The relative expression level was calculated by the 2<sup>\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct</sup> method as shown previously (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stankovic and Corfas, 2003</a>)."

                                "text": "Inner ear physiology, including vestibular evoked potentials (VsEPs, the summed activity of the vestibular afferent pathways to sudden head accelerations), auditory brainstem responses (ABRs, the summed activity of auditory afferent pathways to short tone bursts), and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), was performed on mice anesthetized with xylazine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.). Analysis of animals without noise exposure was performed on 5- to 6-week old mice. For experiments involving noise exposure, the first recording was performed at 14\u201315 weeks of age, followed by noise exposure at 16 weeks of age and the additional measurements 1, 3, and 10 days post-exposure. For VsEPs and ABRs, needle electrodes were placed into the skin (a) at the dorsal midline close to the neural crest, (b) behind the left pinna, and (c) at the base of the tail (for a ground electrode). For VsEPs, mice were positioned on their backs, with the head coupled securely to a shaker platform. Stimuli were linear acceleration ramps, 2 ms in duration, applied in the earth\u2013vertical axis at 17/s with alternating stimulus polarity. An accelerometer, mounted near the head, was used to calibrate the resultant jerk, which is expressed in dB <i>re</i> 1.0 g/ms. Electrophysiological activity was amplified (10,000\u00d7), filtered (0.3\u20133 kHz), and digitized (125 kHz), and 1024 responses were averaged at each stimulus level. We collected an intensity series in 5 dB steps encompassing stimulus levels above and below threshold. ABR potentials were evoked with 5 ms tone pips (0.5 ms rise-fall, with a cos<sup>2</sup> envelope, at 40/s) delivered to the eardrum at log-spaced frequencies from 5.6 to 32 kHz. The response was amplified (10,000\u00d7) and filtered (0.3\u20133 kHz) with an analog-to-digital board in a PC-based data acquisition system. Sound level was raised in 5 dB steps from 10 to 80 dB sound pressure level (SPL). At each level, 1024 responses were averaged (with stimulus polarity alternated) after \u2018artifact rejection\u2019. The DPOAEs in response to two primary tones of frequencies f1 and f2 were recorded at (2 \u00d7 f1)\u2212f2, with f2/f1 = 1.2, and the f2 level 10 dB is lower than the f1 level. The ear-canal sound pressure was amplified and digitally sampled at 4 \u00b5s intervals. DPOAE thresholds were defined as the f1 level required to produce a response at 0 dB SPL. These acoustic signals, generated by outer hair cells and measureable in the ear canal, are useful for differential diagnosis: attenuation of ABRs without a change in DPOAEs provides strong evidence for cochlear synaptic or neural dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</a>)."

Confocal <i>z</i>-stacks of the 5.6, 8, 11.3, 16, 22.6, and 32 kHz regions from each cochlea were taken using a Zeiss LSM510 microscope equipped with either 40\u00d7 (1\u00d7 digital zoom, <i>Pou4f3/CreER</i><sup><i>T</i></sup> reporter study) or 63\u00d7 (2\u00d7 digital zoom, synaptic counts) oil immersion lens. The number of inner hair cells (IHCs) at specific cochlear regions was determined based on the DAPI nuclear counts at the IHC focal plane. For synaptic counts, the <i>z</i>-stacks (0.25 \u00b5m step size) were set to span the entire length of IHCs so that all the synaptic specializations were imaged. Image stacks were imported to Amira software (Visage Imaging, San Diego, CA), which produced three-dimensional (3D) renderings of each confocal <i>z</i>-stack using the \u2018connected components\u2019 feature. CtBP2 and GluA2 puncta in each image stacks were then captured and counted automatically. To assess the appositions of CtBP2 with GluA2 puncta (putative synapses) or CtBP2/GluA2 puncta with tdTomato (synaptic puncta on recombined IHCs), the <i>z</i>-stacks were re-imaged using custom software (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Source Code 1</a>) that computed and displayed the <i>x</i>-<i>y</i> projection of the voxel space within 0.5 \u00b5m of the center of each puncta, as identified by Amira analysis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liberman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lin et al., 2011</a>). The number of juxtaposed CtBP2 and GluA2 puncta or CtBP2/GluA2 puncta and tdTomato was visualized and counted from these miniature image arrays. Synaptic counts of each <i>z</i>-stack were divided by the number of IHC nuclei, which could be visualized by weak staining of CtBP2 antibody. Each image usually contained 8\u201310 IHCs."

In addition, they both felt that the new data were very interesting. Based upon these new data, the previous excellence and rigor of the study as indicated by all three reviewers, and the thoughtful comments you had made concerning the differences between the current study and previously-published work, we felt that the manuscript now warranted publication in <i>eLife</i>."

This is a very nicely-performed paper, and the data are largely convincing. Moreover, while there is already a lot known about BDNF and NT-3 during ear development, there are some interesting new conclusions here. The manuscript would, however, be strengthened by considering the following issues: 1) I am concerned about the control baselines in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>-D, which show data that are very important to one of the main conclusions of the paper. In particular, the control NT-3flox is very different from the control NT-3stop, and indeed when the floxed NT-3 allele is inducibly deleted, then it looks just like the control NT-3stop. Which baseline is correct? While I realize there could be differences between different backgrounds, this is really a key issue. To clarify this and to make this important conclusion more definitive, it would be important for the authors to provide additional control populations. For example, they could characterize the PLP-creERT mice in the same genetic backgrounds, but without the NT-3flox or stop alleles."

Using cell-specific and inducible knockout or overexpression technology, the authors demonstrate that NT-3 and BDNF expressed by supporting cells are required for the maintenance of ribbon synapses, a role distinct from that played during embryogenesis. Their findings show that these neurotrophins have segregated roles, with NT-3 having a major effect on cochlear function, while BDNF acts only in the vestibular organs. The central take-home message of this study is that NT-3 overexpression, but not BDNF, increases ribbon synapse density and elicits regeneration of synaptic contacts between hair cells and sensory neurons after acoustic trauma."

They show that the effects of NT3 on cochlear function and synaptic density and are restricted to the high-frequency, basal region of the cochlea. Furthermore, they show that NT3 overexpression is effective in promoting recovery from noise-induced synaptic degeneration, raising the possibility of developing a novel therapeutic approach for noise-induced hearing loss based on these findings."

In particular, the control NT-3flox is very different from the control NT-3stop, and indeed when the floxed NT-3 allele is inducibly deleted, then it looks just like the control NT-3stop. Which baseline is correct? While I realize there could be differences between different backgrounds, this is really a key issue. To clarify this and to make this important conclusion more definitive, it would be important for the authors to provide additional control populations. For example, they could characterize the PLP-creERT mice in the same genetic backgrounds, but without the NT-3flox or stop alleles</i>."
