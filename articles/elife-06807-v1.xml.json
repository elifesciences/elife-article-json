Which model describes RNP granules in living cells is still unclear. In this study, we analyze P bodies in budding yeast and find that they have liquid-like properties. Surprisingly, yeast stress granules adopt a different material state, which is reminiscent of solid protein aggregates and controlled by protein disaggregases. By using an assay to ectopically nucleate RNP granules, we further establish that RNP granule formation does not depend on amyloid-like aggregation but rather involves many promiscuous interactions. Finally, we show that stress granules have different properties in mammalian cells, where they show liquid-like behavior. Thus, we propose that the material state of RNP granules is flexible and that the solid state of yeast stress granules is an adaptation to extreme environments, made possible by the presence of a powerful disaggregation machine."

Which model describes RNP granules in living cells is still unclear. In this study, we analyze P bodies in budding yeast and find that they have liquid-like properties. Surprisingly, yeast stress granules adopt a different material state, which is reminiscent of solid protein aggregates and controlled by protein disaggregases. By using an assay to ectopically nucleate RNP granules, we further establish that RNP granule formation does not depend on amyloid-like aggregation but rather involves many promiscuous interactions. Finally, we show that stress granules have different properties in mammalian cells, where they show liquid-like behavior. Thus, we propose that the material state of RNP granules is flexible and that the solid state of yeast stress granules is an adaptation to extreme environments, made possible by the presence of a powerful disaggregation machine."

While P bodies are indeed liquid droplets, stress granules are more solid in nature and act like protein aggregates. So why is there a difference between the two? It is known from previous work that when cells are stressed, many proteins misfold and start aggregating. Kroschwald et al. found that the formation of stress granules coincides with the formation of aggregates, suggesting that stress granules themselves are a type of aggregate. Furthermore, stress granule formation does not seem to involve prion-like fibers, but rather prion-like proteins can easily interact with other proteins in a promiscuous way, thus promoting the seeding of stress granules and their growth."

Prion domains (PDs) and prion-like domains (PLDs) have little structure under normal conditions. However, they can undergo spontaneous conversions into an aggregated state, which is characterized by a cross-\u03b2 structure and referred to as amyloid (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alberti et al., 2009</a>).

These pathological RNP aggregates are similar to those observed in cell-free reconstitution experiments, raising important questions about the relationship of physiological and pathological RNP granules in living cells. More insight into this topic is also desirable in light of the fact that two different models have been proposed to explain RNP granule assembly, which make very different predictions about the material state of RNP granules (liquid vs solid) and their mode of assembly (phase separation vs aggregation)."

We further establish a key role for RNA in RNP granule assembly and demonstrate that PLDs in RNA-binding proteins promote RNP granule formation in a manner that does not involve amyloid-like aggregation. Instead, these domains undergo promiscuous interactions, with other PLDs or with misfolded proteins. We further reveal a central role for ATP-driven disaggregases in maintaining the identity and integrity of RNP granules and propose that the presence of the Hsp104 disaggregase in yeast has enabled the evolution of a unique pathway for RNP granule formation, which resembles a typical protein aggregation reaction."

First, we studied its subcellular localization in yeast carrying the background prion [<i>PIN+</i>], a factor that promotes the conversion of the Rnq1 protein and other yeast prion proteins into an amyloid state. In these cells, GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged Rnq1PD assembled into punctate structures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To determine whether Rnq1PD could also aggregate in the absence of a co-inducing prion, we expressed it in a [<i>pin\u2212</i>] background. The resulting cells also displayed a punctate fluorescence signal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, the pattern of aggregation was different, because not all the signal was concentrated in foci (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Next, we analyzed these cells by semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE); this method can separate SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) -soluble from SDS-insoluble fractions, SDS insolubility being a hallmark of amyloid polymers (<a href=\"#bib5\">Alberti et al., 2010</a>). Using this technique, we found that Rnq1PD formed SDS-resistant polymers in [<i>PIN+</i>] cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The Rnq1PD structures in [<i>PIN+</i>] cells could also be stained with the amyloid-specific dye Thioflavin T (ThT) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In contrast, Rnq1PD expressed in [<i>pin\u2212</i>] cells did not form SDS-resistant aggregates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and it could not be stained with ThT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thus, we conclude that Rnq1PD can form two types of assemblies in yeast cells: amyloid-like aggregates and non-amyloid assemblies."

Many nucleoporins contain domains of low sequence complexity, which are compositionally similar to yeast PDs and form a sieve-like matrix that enables the selective passage of cargo complexes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Frey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Frey and Gorlich, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hulsmann et al., 2012</a>). Importantly, sieve formation involves weak hydrophobic interactions between phenylalanine\u2013glycine repeats that are embedded in the PLD. When these interactions are perturbed by 1,6-hexanediol, nucleocytoplasmic transport ceases (<a href=\"#bib69\">Ribbeck and Gorlich, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Patel et al., 2007</a>)."

Importantly, this process was reversible (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>).

However, the PLD of Lsm4 has not only been implicated in RNP granule formation, it also assembles into an amyloid-like state (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alberti et al., 2009</a>). Because the induction of an amyloid state is a concentration-dependent nucleation process, the conformational conversion of prion-like proteins into amyloid can be induced in [<i>PIN+</i>] yeast cells by raising their concentration. Thus, by expressing additional Lsm4 from a plasmid in the [<i>PIN+</i>] background, we could genetically drive endogenous Lsm4 into an amyloid state. In this state, endogenous Lsm4 formed one to a few fluorescent puncta in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, upper panel). Lsm4 was also present in puncta in uninduced cells, but they were smaller (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, left lower panel). Previous studies identified these puncta as P bodies (<a href=\"#bib23\">Decker et al., 2007</a>). Because P-body formation is strongly enhanced by stress, we next analyzed the localization of Lsm4 after glucose depletion. Now, Lsm4 was present in a few large puncta per cell (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, right lower panel), and this stress-induced localization pattern was reminiscent of the pattern formed by Lsm4 in the amyloid conformation. We further observed that other P-body components such as Edc3 and Dcp2 co-localized with amyloid-like Lsm4 structures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). One potential explanation for this is that amyloid formation by Lsm4 occurs during the formation of P bodies."

As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, Lsm4 did not become resistant to SDS in response to glucose depletion or robust heat stress. In contrast, SDS-resistant polymers were readily detected, when Lsm4 was genetically driven into an amyloid conformation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We then prepared lysates from stressed cells in mild detergent (in the absence of SDS) and subjected them to size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Lsm4 in the amyloid state formed very large complexes, whereas Lsm4 complexes in stressed cells were much smaller (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). As a next step, we investigated the dynamic behavior of Lsm4 in P bodies. To do this, we tagged Lsm4 with the fluorophore Dendra2. The resulting yeast strain was stressed by removal of glucose, and P body-localized Lsm4-Dendra2 was photo-converted from green to red. The recovery of the green fluorescence in the P bodies was then followed over time. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, the turnover of Lsm4 in P bodies was rapid and in the same range as previously reported for mammalian P-body components (<a href=\"#bib9\">Andrei et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Kedersha et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aizer et al., 2008</a>). However, the turnover rate of Lsm4 in the amyloid conformation was much slower (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Next, we tested whether Lsm4 assemblies are dependent on RNA for their formation, as demonstrated previously for other RNP granules (<a href=\"#bib9\">Andrei et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Teixeira et al., 2005</a>). Indeed, stress-induced Lsm4-labeled P bodies disassembled in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, an inhibitor that traps RNAs on polysomes and thereby depletes P bodies of RNA substrates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). In contrast, Lsm4 in the amyloid state was unaffected by cycloheximide, suggesting that the formation of this structure is independent of RNA."

Solid states instead are based on tight interactions, which are largely invariant over time. We reasoned that hexanediol could be a useful tool to differentiate between liquid-like and solid-like states, because of its ability to interfere with weak hydrophobic interactions. In fact, hexanediol has been used previously to assess the liquid-like nature of germ granules in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib78\">Updike et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, when we added hexanediol to yeast cells, it dissolved P bodies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Importantly, this effect was rapid (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and reversible, as P bodies reformed after hexanediol washout (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). This suggests that P bodies\u2014similar to germ granules in <i>C. elegans</i>\u2014rely on weak interactions for their formation. Thus, we conclude that yeast P-bodies resemble liquid droplets with physicochemical properties unlike those of solid amyloid-like aggregates."

We therefore wondered whether yeast stress granules show similar liquid-like behavior as P bodies. To investigate this, we tested the effect of hexanediol on stress granules. Remarkably, hexanediol did not affect stress granule integrity, even when applied for extended times or in the presence of digitonin to facilitate hexanediol entry into the cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figures 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>).

To investigate whether these proteins undergo amyloid-like conformational conversions, we initially focused on one stress granule protein: Nrp1. Nrp1 is a prototypical stress granule protein in that it contains a RNA-binding domain (RRM - RNA recognition motif) and a PLD (<a href=\"#bib15\">Buchan et al., 2008</a>). However, Nrp1 can also be converted into an amyloid-like state (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alberti et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, it is one of the proteins capable of binding to b-isox (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kwon et al., 2013</a>), a chemical that specifically binds to low-complexity domains, which have the ability to undergo amyloid-like conformational conversions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kato et al., 2012</a>)."

In the resulting cells, Nrp1 localized to one or a few bright cytoplasmic foci (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, top panel). The same localization pattern was observed in stressed cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, lower panel). Both structures co-localized with other stress granule proteins such as Pab1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), which is consistent with the possibility that genetically induced amyloid-like Nrp1 structures are genuine stress granules. Thus, we next investigated whether stress triggers an amyloid-like conversion in Nrp1 using SDD-AGE. However, Nrp1 did not become SDS-resistant in response to stress (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Nrp1 complexes also had a very different molecular size in stressed cells (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, we found that the turnover rate of amyloid-like Nrp1 was much slower (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). As a next step, we investigated four additional stress granule proteins with PLDs using SDD-AGE. However, none of these proteins formed amyloid-like structures in stressed cells (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Furthermore, stress-induced Nrp1 assemblies were ThT negative, whereas genetically induced Nrp1 assemblies were stainable with ThT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Thus, we conclude that stress granules are more solid-like but like P bodies do not transition into amyloid-like states upon stress."

A previous study showed that in heat-stressed cells, the formation of stress granules coincides with the formation of protein aggregates, which result from stress-induced protein misfolding (<a href=\"#bib21\">Cherkasov et al., 2013</a>). Thus, we reasoned that stress granules might be functional aggregates that behave in a similar manner as aggregates formed by misfolded proteins. To investigate this, we compared the aggregation behavior of stress granule components and misfolded proteins by time-lapse microscopy. For this purpose, we used yeast strains co-expressing GFP-tagged stress granule proteins (Pbp1 or Nrp1) and mCherry-tagged misfolding-prone proteins (a mutant variant of luciferase or a thermo-labile variant of Ubc9, Ubc9ts) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kaganovich et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Gupta et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, in cells that were exposed to a robust heat shock of 46\u00b0C, stress granule proteins co-localized with luciferase or Ubc9ts in punctate structures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Co-localization was also observed between Nrp1 and several chaperones, such as Hsp42, Ssa1, and Hsp104 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This indicates that stress granule proteins and misfolded proteins are co-deposited, as previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib21\">Cherkasov et al., 2013</a>)."

Importantly, cells that had dissolved their stress granules re-entered into the cell cycle (<a href=\"#media7 media8 media9\">Videos 7\u20139</a>), although they still contained aggregated misfolded proteins. This suggests that the presence of misfolded proteins does not prevent re-entry into the cell cycle and that resumption of growth may be coupled to stress granule dissolution. It also implies that stress granule components are less aggregation-prone than the misfolding-prone model proteins used in our study. To investigate this possibility, we repeated the heat shock experiment at 42\u00b0C. Indeed, under mild heat-shock conditions only luciferase and Ubc9ts formed visible aggregates, whereas the stress granule component Nrp1 remained diffusely localized (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). These findings suggest that stress granule components behave like misfolding-prone proteins, which reversibly aggregate into stress granules, when cells are exposed to robust environmental stress."

To determine whether stress granules induced by other stresses behave in a similar way, we exposed yeast to glucose depletion. Glucose removal also caused stress granule formation, and this was accompanied by a low level of luciferase aggregation (see <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). However, in contrast to heat stress conditions, luciferase and stress granule components coalesced into largely distinct structures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>).

Therefore, we next tested how protein disaggregases affect stress granule formation. Three different proteins promote the disaggregation of protein aggregates in yeast: Hsp104 and two members of the Hsp110 family, called Sse1 and Sse2 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Shorter, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Duennwald et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Rampelt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Doyle et al., 2013</a>). We compared wild-type cells and cells in which these proteins had been inactivated genetically. Deletion of either of the disaggregases led to more pronounced stress granule assembly and a delay in stress granule disassembly (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>, <a href=\"#media11\">Video 11</a>). However, inactivation of Hsp104 had the strongest effect. Similar findings were obtained for stress granules induced by glucose depletion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Thus, we conclude that stress granules are functional aggregates and that the components contained in stress granules need to be reactivated by disaggregation before cells can re-enter into the cell cycle. Consistent with this, a recent report showed that cell cycle-associated RNP granules in the multinuclear fungus <i>Ashbya gossypii</i> are functional aggregates that are remodeled by chaperones (<a href=\"#bib54\">Lee et al., 2015</a>)."

However, it remained unclear whether this is a general mode of stress granule formation or only applies to conditions of robust heat stress. Investigation of a seeding function requires experimental control over the aggregated state of a protein in the context of a living cell. To achieve this, we developed a method based on a self-assembling protein fragment, derived from a viral capsid protein (\u03bcNS). This fragment assembles into large spherical particles in cells, and these particles could be visualized by adding GFP to the N terminus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To exclude that these particles are aggregates of misfolded protein, we first tested whether they co-localize with chaperones (Ssa1 and Hsp104). However, chaperones did not associate with \u03bcNS particles (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that the particles are invisible to the protein quality control system."

Left: a fragment of the viral capsid protein \u03bcNS comprising the 250 C-terminal amino acids forms self-assembling particles in yeast cells. The particles were visualized using an N-terminal sfGFP tag. Right: interaction assay. Fusion of a protein X to sfGFP-tagged \u03bcNS particles allows interaction studies with a mCherry-tagged protein Y. (<b>B</b>) \u03bcNS particles carrying mutant luciferase on the surface interact with endogenous mCherry-tagged Hsp104. Cells were observed before and after a 10-min heat shock at 46\u00b0C.

(<b>D</b>) Same as (<b>C</b>), except that mCherry-tagged Nrp1 was mildly overexpressed from a plasmid carrying an ADH1 promoter.

In this study, bait proteins were genetically fused to the \u03bcNS fragment, which resulted in the presentation of the bait protein on the particle surface. Using this approach, we generated particles that carried either mutated luciferase or Ubc9ts on the surface. We found that both types of particles were recognized by chaperones (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that the misfolded proteins are accessible on the particle surface. Using these particles, we next tested whether misfolded Ubc9ts or luciferase could recruit stress granule components. Under normal growth conditions (25\u02daC), the two stress granule proteins Pab1 or Pub1 were not enriched on the particle surface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, upper panels). However, during a robust heat shock Pub1 and Pab1 accumulated on \u03bcNS particles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, lower panels). Naked particles on the other hand did not recruit Pab1 or Pub1 (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), indicating that stress granule assembly was specifically triggered by the misfolded proteins. Furthermore, interaction of Pub1 or Pab1 with luciferase was only observed under robust heat shock and not under glucose depletion conditions (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Thus, we conclude that misfolded proteins can nucleate the formation of stress granules under severe heat stress conditions, but not under mild stress conditions or during normal growth."

Nrp1 has an intrinsically disordered PLD, which can undergo amyloid-like conformational conversions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alberti et al., 2009</a>) and shows specific binding to b-isox (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kwon et al., 2013</a>). We speculated that the structural flexibility of the PLD could promote the interaction of Nrp1 with misfolded proteins. To test this hypothesis, we mildly overexpressed Nrp1-mCherry in cells carrying luciferase-coated \u03bcNS particles. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, Nrp1 weakly interacted with the particles, even in the absence of stress. Importantly, when we subsequently applied a robust heat shock, a large amount of Nrp1 accumulated on the surface of the particle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This suggests that the interaction between Nrp1 and misfolded proteins is sufficient to ectopically induce stress granule formation. Next, we tested a variant of Nrp1 lacking the PLD. Remarkably, this variant was unable to recognize the luciferase-coated particle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). In contrast, the isolated PLD showed robust binding to luciferase particles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), demonstrating that the PLD is sufficient for the interaction with misfolded proteins. Thus, PLDs can promiscuously interact with misfolded proteins, and such promiscuous interactions can nucleate the formation of stress granules, in particular under conditions of robust heat stress."

We reasoned that under mild stress conditions the activity of the cellular chaperone machinery is sufficient to prevent promiscuous interactions between misfolded proteins and stress granule components.

Thus, we hypothesized that preconditioning could prevent the co-aggregation of stress granule components and misfolded proteins. We preconditioned yeast cells by increasing the temperatures incrementally from 25\u00b0C to 46\u00b0C. Under these conditions, Pab1 and Pub1 did not co-aggregate with misfolded proteins but formed assemblies in distinct areas of the cell (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s7\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). This shows that molecular chaperones constantly work to prevent promiscuous interactions with misfolded proteins and that misfolded proteins only act as scaffolds for stress granules when the capacity of the protein quality control machinery is overrun. It also suggests that preconditioned cells are protected from promiscuous interactions with misfolded proteins, presumably because of the up-regulation of chaperones."

To investigate how stress granules form independently of misfolded proteins, we again focused on Nrp1. We first tested which domains of Nrp1 are required for recruitment to stress granules. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>, the RBD alone was sufficient for localization to stress granules, whereas the PLD was not. This is consistent with many other studies, which reported that PLDs are dispensable for RNP granule localization (<a href=\"#bib68\">Reijns et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cai and Futcher, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Grousl et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Kruger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bley et al., 2014</a>). One potential explanation for the observed dispensability of PLDs is that they mediate interactions that are redundant and weak and thus only manifest when these domains are present at high local concentrations. To test this possibility, we used our particle assay to concentrate stress granule proteins in living cells, thus, creating a molecular environment similar to that in RNP granules. First, we generated particles that carried full-length Nrp1 on the surface. After having confirmed that Nrp1-\u03bcNS particles are not recognized by chaperones (<a href=\"#fig6s8\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 8</a>), we tested whether Nrp1 could ectopically nucleate the formation of stress granules. Indeed, particle-bound Nrp1 was able to recruit additional Nrp1 molecules from the cytosol, and upon heat shock (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>, bottom panel) and glucose depletion (<a href=\"#fig6s9\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 9</a>, bottom panel) stress granules formed on Nrp1 particles. As a next step, we tested which domains of Nrp1 are required for this behavior. We generated two deletion mutants comprising either the RBD or the PLD. We first confirmed that these truncation mutants were not misfolded when presented on the particle surface (<a href=\"#fig6s10\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 10</a>). Using these particles, we found that both the PLD and the RBD were able to recruit full-length Nrp1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>) and promoted the formation of stress granules (<a href=\"#fig6s11\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 11</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s12\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 12</a>). Together, these findings indicate that stress granule assembly is highly redundant and that nucleation can proceed in multiple ways, through PLDs or RBDs. Our data further suggest that PLDs work synergistically with RBDs and only function when present at a high local concentration, as during RNP granule assembly."

                                "text": "Our findings so far show that P bodies are liquid-like droplets, in contrast to stress granules, which behave as true aggregates. Because of this distinction, we predicted that P bodies do not co-aggregate with misfolded proteins. Indeed, we found that P bodies showed only marginal co-localization with misfolded proteins in cells exposed to robust heat stress (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Co-localization with chaperones, such as Hsp42, Ssa1 and Hsp104, was also limited (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We next tested whether P-body formation and dissolution is affected by protein disaggregases. Under normal or mild stress conditions, Hsp104 deficiency did not affect P-body formation. However, upon robust heat stress (46\u00b0C), the P-body protein Edc3 assembled into irregular aggregate-like structures (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), which persisted for extended times (<a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a>). These aggregate-like structures co-localized with the stress granule marker Pub1 and misfolded proteins (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), suggesting that Edc3 is mistargeted to stress granules in the absence of Hsp104. Similar findings were made for the P-body protein Lsm4 (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Next, we generated strains that expressed Hsp104 at different levels. We found that the amount of Edc3 that co-aggregated with misfolded proteins decreased when the expression level of Hsp104 was increased (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>, <a href=\"#media13\">Video 13</a>). This indicates that maintenance of the liquid-like P-body state requires the continuous action of Hsp104 during acute stress and that P-body components are mistargeted to stress granules, when the disaggregation activity is insufficient."

Second, the components within the compartment should undergo rapid internal rearrangement and third, two liquid droplets should fuse and relax into one droplet. Indeed, the stress granules and P bodies in our cell lines had a characteristic circular shape (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), as expected for a liquid-droplet state. We also noticed that stress granules, in particular in the early stage of stress exposure, merged and formed larger structures over time (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, <a href=\"#media14\">Video 14</a>), as did P bodies (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, <a href=\"#media15\">Video 15</a>). In both cases, the structures rapidly relaxed into more spherical structures, in agreement with a liquid-like state. Next, we applied a technique known as \u2018half-bleach\u2019 to test for internal mobility within the compartment. In this method, roughly half a structure is bleached, and the distribution of the fluorescence within the photo-manipulated structure is then determined over time (<a href=\"#bib13\">Brangwynne et al., 2009</a>). The analysis of such a half-bleach event showed that G3BP2 was redistributed rapidly within stress granules from the unbleached to the bleached area (because of the small size we cannot perform a similar experiment for P bodies) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). To further investigate the material properties of these RNP granules, we treated HeLa cells harboring P bodies and stress granules with hexanediol. Hexanediol triggered the disintegration of both types of compartments, whereas a control amyloid structure, Q103-GFP, was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Thus, we conclude that P bodies and stress granules have liquid-like properties in mammalian cells: they turn over rapidly, are spherical, and when they fuse they relax into one spherical assembly. This is consistent with previous fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies showing that components within mammalian RNP granules turn over rapidly (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kedersha et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Andrei et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Kedersha et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aizer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bley et al., 2014</a>)."

We find that these RNP granules have distinct material properties in yeast cells: whereas P bodies show more liquid-like behavior, stress granules exhibit characteristic properties of solid aggregates. We further show that the formation of yeast stress granules does not involve amyloid-like conformational conversions. Rather, yeast stress granules resemble amorphous protein aggregates. Assembly of these aggregates depends on interactions with RNAs, and PLDs in RNA-binding proteins contribute to granule formation, by promiscuously interacting with other PLDs or with misfolded proteins. Finally, we show that stress granules have very different properties in mammalian cells, where they have liquid-like characteristics and do not behave as aggregates. In summary, these findings show that RNP granule formation is highly flexible, and that under conditions of acute stress, disaggregating machines play a key role in maintaining the identity and integrity of RNP granules (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

This is particularly important for single-celled organisms such as yeast because they are directly exposed to environmental fluctuations. How can a cell respond rapidly and efficiently to stress, while at the same time solving the task of adjusting the activities of numerous proteins and RNAs? An increasing number of studies suggest that this can be achieved by building compartments. Such compartments are condensed phases of proteins and RNAs, which exchange components with the surrounding cytoplasm or nucleoplasm (<a href=\"#bib13\">Brangwynne et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Hyman and Brangwynne, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Hyman and Simons, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Feric and Brangwynne, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hubstenberger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Hyman et al., 2014</a>). Two types of compartments can be distinguished: compartments for localized biochemistry in which specific chemical reactions occur; and compartments for storage, where macromolecules adopt an inactive, yet re-activatable state. The prediction would be that these two types of compartments have different properties."

P bodies are therefore expected to have different properties than stress granules. A P body should allow for the continuous entry and exit of RNAs and proteins, and the components within a P body should be able to rearrange. A liquid phase meets these demands. Stress granules on the other hand do not need to be liquid-like. Their function is to inactivate proteins and RNAs by removing them from the cytoplasm. Thus, a solid-like state is fully compatible with the function of stress granules. Our findings indeed reveal a remarkable distinction between yeast P-bodies and stress granules. Previous studies have also pointed to differences (<a href=\"#bib15\">Buchan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Decker and Parker, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Mitchell et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Shah et al., 2013</a>). Based on these findings, we propose that yeast P-bodies are liquid-like droplets that form by demixing from the cytoplasm, whereas yeast stress granules form through a liquid\u2013solid phase transition (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). We hypothesize that these findings are specific to yeast and do not apply to mammalian cells. Indeed, studies suggest that mammalian cells have developed other ways of controlling stress granule assembly, primarily through posttranslational modifications of stress granule proteins (<a href=\"#bib8\">Anderson and Kedersha, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Buchan and Parker, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kedersha et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wippich et al., 2013</a>).

We do not yet understand how hexanediol perturbs RNP granules. However, it should be noted that hexanediol is widely used as an additive in protein crystallization studies. Protein crystallization is typically approached in an empirical manner, and its success often depends on the formation of a liquid protein phase by phase separation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Galkin and Vekilov, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Chen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Dumetz et al., 2008</a>). It is believed that additives such as hexanediol inhibit or promote the formation of this liquid phase, or otherwise modify its physicochemical properties, and by doing so favor the formation of a crystal. Thus, we speculate that hexanediol perturbs the weak interactions in liquid-like assemblies, leaving stronger interactions that are characteristic of more solid-like structures intact. This suggests that hexanediol could be a useful tool to probe the material properties of cellular structures."

A previous study suggested that stress granule components assemble around misfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib21\">Cherkasov et al., 2013</a>). However, this hypothesis could not be tested directly because it requires control over the nucleation step of protein aggregation. Using an assay to ectopically form protein aggregates, we show that misfolded proteins can indeed nucleate stress granules, in particular when the stress intensity is high and when the overall disaggregation activity is low. However, although yeast stress granules resemble aggregates, they showed no properties of amyloids: they could not be stained with ThT, and we found no evidence that stress granule proteins convert into structures with amyloid-like properties. This suggests that stress granule proteins do not assemble into amyloid-like aggregates under physiological conditions, but rather form amorphous aggregates."

Upon stress, these domains could expose interaction sites that promote assembly into amorphous aggregates. We propose that assembly through these sensor domains is largely specific, as this would provide better control over the assembly process and could facilitate dissolution in the recovery phase. In fact, a similar type of assembly has been observed in starved yeast, where several metabolic enzymes form higher order assemblies (<a href=\"#bib59\">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Noree et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Petrovska et al., 2014</a>). These enzymes polymerize upon energy depletion, and when yeast cells are replenished with nutrients, they disassemble within minutes. How enzyme assembly can be specific in the crowded environment of a cell is still unclear, but it probably involves interactions via protein surfaces that are sterically and electrostatically compatible. Thus, we propose that yeast stress granules are functional aggregates, which assemble through a controlled process that is driven by a range of specific and promiscuous interactions between proteins and RNAs."

Assembly into these structures was accompanied by the formation of hydrogels, and these hydrogels could reversibly interact with other prion-like proteins in a homotypic or heterotypic manner. Accordingly, a model for RNP granule assembly was proposed that put a strong emphasis on the ability of PLDs to assemble into amyloid-like protein scaffolds (<a href=\"#bib37\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kato et al., 2012</a>). The problem with this model, however, is that hydrogels only rearrange over long timescales, and thus can hardly provide the dynamic properties that are characteristic of RNP granules in living cells (<a href=\"#bib80\">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Malinovska et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bley et al., 2014</a>). To account for this, it was suggested that these amyloid-like fibers are dynamic in vivo, due to regulation by posttranslational modifications (<a href=\"#bib37\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kato et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Kwon et al., 2013</a>).

Using this assay, we find that prion-like proteins promote RNP granule formation, but independently of amyloid-like conversions. Thus, above a certain critical concentration, PLDs can promote a phase transition of RNA-binding proteins into RNP granules. Based on these findings, we favor the following two-step model of RNP granule formation: First, RNA-binding proteins bind to RNAs through multivalent interactions via RBDs, forming complexes of RNA and protein; these RNP complexes may already reach a relatively large size. In the second step, these RNP complexes condense into RNP granules driven by promiscuous interactions between PLDs and further associations between RNAs and RBDs. In this model, the PLDs primarily assist the final coalescence step, thus, promoting the condensation of RNPs into large compartments (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). In agreement with this, recent findings indicate that PLDs are not essential for RNP granule formation per se but rather promote the fusion of RNP granules and their enlargement into bigger RNP compartments (<a href=\"#bib73\">Shiina and Nakayama, 2014</a>). However, the function of PLDs may also depend on their specific local environment: In P bodies, the collective properties of PLDs may be important for maintaining a dynamic, liquid-like state, whereas in solid assemblies such as stress granules, PLDs may act as molecular glue to connect RNA-binding proteins with other RNA-binding proteins or misfolded proteins. Thus, PLDs may function as adaptable interaction domains, which do not undergo conversions into structurally well-defined amyloid-like states, but mediate promiscuous interactions with many binding partners in their local environment. Such behavior would be highly favorable, because it allows a high degree of flexibility during compartment formation."

In contrast to yeast, mammalian cells do not express a Hsp104 homolog in the cytosol. Therefore, we speculate that the ability of yeast to enter into a solid stress granule state has co-evolved with Hsp104, providing a potential explanation for why yeast and mammalian stress granules have different material properties. In contrast to mammalian organisms, sedentary yeast cells cannot escape from harsh environments. We conjecture that for yeast, formation of solid stress granules is an effective way of preserving the pre-stress state of the cytosol and that a selected set of yeast proteins and RNAs has been modified by evolution to aggregate upon stress. Consistent with this, a recent study showed that the yeast proteome has a higher overall aggregation propensity than the human proteome (<a href=\"#bib6\">Albu et al., 2014</a>). When the stress subsides, Hsp104 reactivates the proteins and RNAs preserved in solid stress granules, thus promoting re-entry into the cell cycle. We note that this situation is reminiscent of dormancy, as for example in spores or seeds, where an entire organism enters into a resting state by solidifying its macromolecular components (<a href=\"#bib61\">Parry et al., 2014</a>). Future work will show whether controlled entry into a solid phase can provide general protection to a cell in stressful environments."

After centrifugation for 5 min at 13.000 rpm at 4\u00b0C, protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using the Bradford protein assay (BioRad, Germany). Equal amounts were loaded onto the column. To efficiently resolve the protein complexes, we used the TSK-Gel G6000PWXL (Tosoh Bioscience, Japan) column with a separation range between 40 kDa and 8.000 kDa. The column was equilibrated in running buffer (2 \u00d7 PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)) and calibrated with different standard proteins: Tyroglobulin (660 kDa), Ferritin (440 kDa), Catalase (240 kDa), and BSA (bovine serum albumin) (67 kDa). Subsequently, a dot blot assay was performed using a vacuum slot blot device (Whatman, United Kingdom). The fractions were collected on protein-binding nitrocellulose membrane (Protran B 85, Whatman) and the resulting membrane was used for immunodetection with an anti-GFP antibody."

Two such subcellular compartments are processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (SGs), which are composed of RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Many of the protein constituents of SGs and P-bodies contain domains resembling yeast prions (called prion-like domains). Are SGs and P-bodies merely protein aggregates or do they represent structures with other physical and chemical properties? The manuscript by Kroschwald et al. addresses the physicochemical nature of RNP bodies and uses genetic, chemical, and microscopic imaging approaches. The paper focuses on P bodies and stress granules in budding yeast, and mammalian tissue culture cells are also briefly considered. The authors convincingly show that there are different types of bodies that form in yeast: dynamic liquid-like structures that are SDS soluble and which can also be dissolved in vivo by the application of the aliphatic alcohol hexanediol, and more static, amyloid-like structures that are SDS insoluble and hexanediol resistant. Disaggregases, in particularly <i>hsp104</i>, were capable of re-dissolving heat or glucose-starvation induced granules, suggesting that the assembly of these kinds of structures may be dynamically regulated. The authors also utilize a somewhat novel genetically encoded particle assembled from a viral capsid protein to test the ability of different proteins to recruit P body and stress granule components. The following suggestions are offered for improving the manuscript:"

In living cells, however, some structures diffuse very rapidly. To image P bodies and other structures, we acquired z stacks of yeast cells. This required that we take multiple images of the same cell in different planes, often in two different channels (GFP and mCherry). Although we imaged the GFP and mCherry signals of each plane in quick sequential order, a movement of the P body during the acquisition often led to somewhat offset localization of the two signals. Thus, this does not reflect a true lack of colocalization, but is due to a technical problem. The same offset was not observed for amyloid-like assemblies, because they are usually larger and thus diffuse much more slowly."
