                    "text": "During development, tissue repair, and tumor growth, most blood vessel networks are generated through angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of this process and currently both VEGF and its receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and Neuropilin1 (NRP1), are targeted in therapeutic strategies for vascular disease and cancer. NRP1 is essential for vascular morphogenesis, but how NRP1 functions to guide vascular development has not been completely elucidated. In this study, we generated a mouse line harboring a point mutation in the endogenous <i>Nrp1</i> locus that selectively abolishes VEGF-NRP1 binding (<i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>VEGF\u2212</i></sup>). <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>VEGF\u2212</i></sup> mutants survive to adulthood with normal vasculature revealing that NRP1 functions independent of VEGF-NRP1 binding during developmental angiogenesis. Moreover, we found that <i>Nrp1</i>-deficient vessels have reduced VEGFR2 surface expression in vivo demonstrating that NRP1 regulates its co-receptor, VEGFR2. Given the resources invested in NRP1-targeted anti-angiogenesis therapies, our results will be integral for developing strategies to re-build vasculature in disease."

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of this process and currently both VEGF and its receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and Neuropilin1 (NRP1), are targeted in therapeutic strategies for vascular disease and cancer. NRP1 is essential for vascular morphogenesis, but how NRP1 functions to guide vascular development has not been completely elucidated. In this study, we generated a mouse line harboring a point mutation in the endogenous <i>Nrp1</i> locus that selectively abolishes VEGF-NRP1 binding (<i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>VEGF\u2212</i></sup>). <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>VEGF\u2212</i></sup> mutants survive to adulthood with normal vasculature revealing that NRP1 functions independent of VEGF-NRP1 binding during developmental angiogenesis. Moreover, we found that <i>Nrp1</i>-deficient vessels have reduced VEGFR2 surface expression in vivo demonstrating that NRP1 regulates its co-receptor, VEGFR2. Given the resources invested in NRP1-targeted anti-angiogenesis therapies, our results will be integral for developing strategies to re-build vasculature in disease."

For example, tumors often stimulate the growth of new blood vessels to ensure a good supply of blood carrying nutrients and oxygen.

Gelfand et al. instead found that mice that only lack NRP1 in the cells of their blood vessels had less of another receptor protein called VEGFR2 on the surface of these cells. This result suggests that NRP1 controls blood vessel development, not by binding to VEGF but by affecting how much of the VEGFR2 receptor is available to interact with VEGF."

The molecular mechanisms underlying angiogenesis have become increasingly clear, and VEGF is an essential player in this process (<a href=\"#bib2\">Carmeliet et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ferrara et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Iruela-Arispe and Dvorak, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Miquerol et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ruhrberg et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Stalmans et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Rossant and Hirashima, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Maes et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Coultas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Olsson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chung and Ferrara, 2011</a>). VEGF operates by interacting with three receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2 (KDR/Flk1), and NRP1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ferrara et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chung and Ferrara, 2011</a>). Although these three receptors are expressed in spatially and temporally overlapping patterns, they are thought to play different roles in VEGF signaling. The main receptor for VEGF, VEGFR2, is a receptor tyrosine kinase whose activity is crucial for VEGF signaling (<a href=\"#bib27\">Olsson et al., 2006</a>). Upon binding VEGF, VEGFR2 phosphorylates intracellular targets leading to a multitude of cellular responses including proliferation, migration, and transcriptional modification via signaling pathways such as PI3K, Src, and PLC\u03d2 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Olsson et al., 2006</a>). In contrast, NRP1 is a multifaceted transmembrane receptor that not only binds VEGF and forms a complex with VEGFR2 but also binds a structurally and functionally unrelated family of traditional axon guidance cues, the secreted class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3) (<a href=\"#bib15\">He and Tessier-Lavigne, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kolodkin et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Soker et al., 1998</a>). Consistent with these binding partners, <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice are embryonically lethal with both neural and vascular defects (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kitsukawa et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kawasaki et al., 1999</a>), indicating that NRP1 protein is instrumental for developmental angiogenesis. However, how NRP1 functions in conjunction with multiple ligands and receptors to guide vascular development remains elusive."

This result strongly demonstrates that NRP1 is a cell autonomously required in endothelial cells for its absolutely essential function in developmental angiogenesis. To pinpoint how SEMA3-NRP1 vs VEGF-NRP1 binding contributes to NRP1's critical role in vascular development, previous work generated a knock-in mouse line, <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>Sema\u2212</i></sup>, in which SEMA3-NRP1 interactions were abolished and VEGF-NRP1 binding was maintained (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gu et al., 2003</a>). <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>Sema\u2212</i></sup> mice mimicked the neural defects observed in the <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> but did not exhibit any vascular abnormalities. These data suggest that SEMA3-NRP1 binding does not mediate NRP1's important function in vascular morphogenesis and instead point to the hypothesis that VEGF-NRP1 interactions may be integral for angiogenesis."

Specifically, an antibody inhibiting VEGF-NRP1 binding was found to interfere with retinal vascular remodeling as well as tumor angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pan et al., 2007</a>) and is currently being developed as a therapeutic strategy to block vessel outgrowth. This study suggests that VEGF-NRP1 binding facilitates pathological angiogenesis. However, in vivo evidence describing a role for VEGF-NRP1 binding in vascular development is currently lacking and the precise function of NRP1 in VEGF-mediated angiogenesis urgently needs to be addressed."

Surprisingly, although VEGF-NRP1 binding was successfully eliminated, the <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>VEGF\u2212</i></sup> mutants survived into adulthood and did not display any of the severe vascular phenotypes seen in either the <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> or the endothelial-specific NRP1 knock-out. Upon closer examination, NRP1-deficient blood vessels in the endothelial-specific NRP1 knock-out exhibited reduced VEGFR2 surface expression, a phenomenon not observed in the <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>VEGF\u2212</i></sup> mutant. These results challenge the well-accepted view that NRP1 requires VEGF-NRP1 binding to facilitate developmental angiogenesis and points to a provocative new hypothesis that the angiogenic role of NRP1 lies in its capacity as a VEGFR2 co-receptor. Interestingly, retinal angiogenesis and blood flow recovery following hindlimb ischemia were mildly perturbed in the <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>VEGF\u2212</i></sup> mutant suggesting that the postnatal vascular system is uniquely sensitive to the loss of VEGF-NRP1 binding. Together, this work not only significantly advances our basic scientific understanding of how NRP1 functions in VEGF-mediated angiogenesis, but also provides new insights that may facilitate the development of more effective NRP1-targeted anti-angiogenesis therapies."

A previous structure\u2013function analysis revealed that the b1 domain of NRP1 is necessary and sufficient for VEGF binding (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gu et al., 2002</a>). However, this b1 region is also required for SEMA3-NRP1 interactions, so a series of <i>Nrp1</i> variants containing smaller deletions in the b1 domain were engineered with site-directed mutagenesis to identify a region specific for VEGF-NRP1 binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Based upon previous publications, we first targeted two specific sites in the b1 domain: the 7-residue binding site of the Pathologische Anatomie Leiden-Endothelium (PAL-E) monoclonal antibody which competes with VEGF for NRP1 binding (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jaalouk et al., 2007</a>) and the 3-residue binding site of the VEGF analog tuftsin (<a href=\"#bib34\">Vander Kooi et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>). COS-1 cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) or mutant <i>Nrp1</i> constructs and assessed for NRP1 expression. PAL-E and tuftsin binding site mutations did not affect NRP1 protein expression at the cell surface as examined by non-permeabilized antibody staining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Ligand binding to NRP1 was assessed using alkaline phosphatase-tagged VEGF (AP-VEGF) and SEMA3A (AP-SEMA3A) in conjunction with alkaline phosphatase histochemistry. All of the PAL-E or tuftsin binding site variants were capable of abolishing VEGF-NRP1 binding, but unfortunately, also eliminated SEMA3-NRP1 binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Specifically, we identified a hydrophilic region comprised of several negatively charged residues that provided a promising mutagenesis site for abolishing VEGF-NRP1 binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Several of these residues were mutated to amino acids of the opposite charge in order to preserve the hydrophilic nature of the region. As with previous <i>Nrp1</i> variants, NRP1 surface expression was unperturbed in transfected COS-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). One of these mutations (E282K) did not affect the binding of either AP-SEMA3A or AP-VEGF, while others (E282K and E420K) eradicated binding of both the ligands (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, the D320K mutation converting aspartic acid 320 into lysine (<i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>D320K</i></sup>) successfully abolished VEGF-NRP1 binding while conserving AP-SEMA3A binding as demonstrated through alkaline phosphatase histochemical staining on transfected COS-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). Moreover, the <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>D320K</i></sup> mutation also abolished the binding of other VEGF family members including Placenta Growth Factor (PlGF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor B (VEGFB) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In a liquid alkaline phosphatase activity assay, <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>D320K</i></sup> was co-expressed with <i>PlexinA4</i> (<i>Plex4A</i>) to more accurately reflect the in vivo situation in which SEMA3A signals through a holoreceptor complex of both NRP1 and PlexinA.

Finally, Western blot analysis confirmed that NRP1 protein expression levels were equivalent in COS-1 cells transfected with <i>WT Nrp1</i> and <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>D320K</i></sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

In this regard, NRP1 must function through an alternative mechanism to regulate vascular development during embryogenesis. The intracellular domain of NRP1 does not have any obvious enzymatic activity and is not responsible for the signal transduction mediating angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fantin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lanahan et al., 2013</a>).

This biochemical assay revealed that total VEGFR2 protein levels were significantly reduced in the <i>Tie2-Cre;Nrp1</i><sup><i>fl/\u2212</i></sup> mutants compared to their control littermates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>). To determine the cell surface expression of VEGFR2 in vivo, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to specifically quantify VEGFR2 expression at the cell surface of non-permeabilized endothelial cells derived from the acutely dissociated lungs of <i>Tie2-Cre;Nrp1</i><sup><i>fl/\u2212</i></sup> and control embryos. Remarkably, <i>Tie2-Cre;Nrp1</i><sup><i>fl/\u2212</i></sup> mutants displayed a significant decrease in the fluorescence intensity of VEGFR2 labeling as compared to control littermates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>), suggesting that NRP1 functions to regulate VEGFR2 surface expression in endothelial cells. In contrast, both Western blot and FACS analysis determined that VEGFR2 protein levels were unperturbed in <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>VEGF\u2212</i></sup> animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D,G\u2013F</a>). In addition, co-immunoprecipitation on P7 lung tissue revealed that NRP1 and VEGFR2 are physically associated in both control and <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>VEGF\u2212</i></sup> animals (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), validating that NRP1-VEGFR2 receptor complex formation does not require VEGF-NRP1 binding in vivo.

A point mutation in this D320 residue was incorporated into the endogenous <i>Nrp1</i> locus to generate the <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>VEGF\u2212</i></sup> mutant, a novel mouse line that selectively abolishes VEGF-NRP1 binding in vivo. Recently a cDNA knock-in NRP1 mutant, <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>Y297A/Y297A</i></sup>, was also developed to examine the role of VEGF-NRP1 binding (<a href=\"#bib6\">Fantin et al., 2014</a>). However, mice generated with genetically modified cDNA notoriously lack the essential intronic regions that regulate the temporal and spatial expression of the gene. Consequently, the aberrant and severe down-regulation of NRP1 protein expression in the <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>Y297A/Y297A</i></sup> hypomorph prevents any definitive conclusions from being garnered about the biological cause of phenotypes present in this mouse. In this regard, abnormalities in the <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>Y297A/Y297A</i></sup> hypomorph could originate from two potential sources: the severe reduction in NRP1 levels or the abolishment of VEGF-NRP1 binding. Unlike the <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>Y297A/Y297A</i></sup> line, our <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>VEGF\u2212</i></sup> mutant contains a two base pair replacement in the endogenous <i>Nrp1</i> locus and preserves the genetic structure of the <i>Nrp1</i> gene.

(2012)</a> examined human glioblastoma multiforme cells and found that shRNA mediated knock-down of NRP1 resulted in dramatically decreased VEGFR2 protein levels accompanied by a lower surface presentation of VEGFR2 and a decrease in cell viability. Moreover, cell surface protein biotinylation and immunofluorescence staining with confocal microscopy confirmed the co-localization of VEGFR2-NRP1 with the early/recycling endosome. Finally, <a href=\"#bib1\">Ballmer-Hofer et al., (2011)</a> used stably transfected porcine aortic endothelial cell (PAEC) lines in conjunction with immunostaining to visually follow VEGFR2 trafficking in the presence and absence of NRP1. Their experiments revealed that upon VEGF stimulation, VEGFR2 is internalized in Rab7 vesicles for degradation. However, in the presence of NRP1, VEGFR2 is stabilized in Rab11 vesicles and recycled back to the cell surface. In conjunction with our in vivo results, these data demonstrate that NRP1 guides vascular development through its capacity as a VEGFR2 co-receptor rather binding to VEGF. In this manner, NRP1 regulates angiogenesis by controlling the amount of VEGFR2 expression at the cell surface and consequently the level of VEGFR2-VEGF signaling."

A prior in vitro study identified a similar relationship between the membrane protein, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Francavilla et al., 2009</a>). This previous work discovered that NCAM induced sustained FGFR1 activation by controlling the intracellular trafficking of the FGFR1 receptor. Specifically, NCAM was capable of re-targeting internalized FGFR1 from the lysosomal degradation pathway to Rab11-postive recycling vesicles and increased FGFR1 expression at the cell surface. In this regard, the co-receptor interaction between NRP1 and VEGFR2 may be representative of a more universal phenomenon in which membrane proteins function to regulate the cell surface expression and subsequent downstream signaling of receptors."

Mutations were made using PCR, and the mutated fragment was subcloned back into pCS2-Nrp1 using endogenous restriction sites. The targeting vector (TV) was constructed using a combination of traditional cloning and recombineering along with point mutagenesis. Genomic DNA was obtained from the 129S7-AB2.2 BAC library, clone #bMQ-373E22. The short (3\u2032) arm (1.3 kb) was cloned into the HpaI and EcoRI sites of 4600C-loxP. Two short homology arms (900 bp, total) were created and cloned into the XhoI and NotI sites of 4600C-loxP, with the two arms joined by a SalI site. The homology arms were ligated in a triple ligation to 4600C-loxP as well as to each other. The vector was then linearized with SalI and electroporated into modified electrocompetent DH10B cells containing the previously mentioned BAC in order to facilitate homologous recombination to insert the remainder of the long arm. Recombineering was performed as described by the NCI-Frederick. After a full-length TV was made, the D320K mutation was introduced. The final TV was linerarized and electroporated into ES cells.

Briefly, eyes were extracted and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Retinas were dissected in PBS and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C. Retinas were then permeabilized in PBS, 1% BSA, and 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4\u00b0C overnight, washed 2\u00d7 for 5 min in 1% PBT (1% Triton X-100 in PBS), and incubated in Isolectin GS-IB4 (1:200, #I21411 Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and anti-\u03b1SMA Cy3 (1:100, #C6198 Sigma-Aldrich, Natick, MA) in 1% PBT overnight at 4\u00b0C. Retinas were washed 3\u00d7 for 5 min and flat-mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (#P36934 Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Flat-mounted retinas were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Eclipe 80i microscope equipped with a Nikon DS-2 digital camera and by confocal laser scanning microscopy using an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. Quantification was performed using MetaMorph Image Analysis Software and ImageJ. At least four retinal leaves were quantified per animal to determine the vascular extension ratio, both eyes were examined in each animal for artery number, and three representative images were quantified from each animal for vascular coverage (representing the total isolectin-positive pixel area per image)."

After anesthesia was achieved, the bilateral hindlimbs and lower abdomen were cleared of hair and cleaned with 10% betadine and 70% alcohol. An incision of 3\u20134 mm was made in the right inguinal area to visualize the femoral artery. Two 6\u20130 silk sutures were tied in the proximal femoral artery and the deep femoral and epigastric artery branches were cauterized. The femoral artery was then ligated between the two sutures. The skin was sutured with one 4\u20130 prolene sutures. Immediately before and after surgery, each animal was scanned with a non-invasive laser doppler imaging system (moorLD12-HR Moor Instruments, Wilmington, DE) under 1\u20133% isofluorane anesthesia. Blood flow recovery in the hindlimbs was further assessed on 3, 5, and 7 days post-surgery and quantified via Moor LDI Software."

The role of Neuropilin-1 is an important piece of the puzzle in VEGF signaling, and the central dogma about Neuropilin-1 is that binding to VEGFA is essential for its function despite lacking direct evidence to support it. Recent attempt to provide direct evidence by assessing a Neuropilin-1 allele that lacks VEGF-A binding capacity fell short to answer this question due to the severe reduction of expression (<a href=\"#bib6\">Fantin et al 2014</a>). In this report, Gelfand et al carried out rigorous analyses of a knockin Neuropilin-1 allele that abolished VEGFA binding yet preserved expression levels, and provided convincing evidence to demonstrate that the VEGFA binding capacity is dispensable for embryonic vascular development. They also provided biochemical evidence implicating Neuropilin-1 in the regulation of VEGFR2 levels. This study unequivocally refutes a dogma in the VEGF signaling field and reveals a novel Neuropilin-1 function. It is suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i>. The overall quality of the paper can be improved by addressing the following comments."

Since the exiting data cannot distinguish between maintaining surface VEGFR2 levels versus regulating total VEGFR2 levels, the mechanism depicted in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a> is not supported by actual data. The diagram should be modified to reflect a reduction in total VEGFR2, and the related text descriptions throughout the manuscript should be revised accordingly."

This is an important issue in the angiogenesis field. The authors have the proper tool and data to address this question. They can contribute to the angiogenesis community by mentioning some aspects of postnatal development in their Npn1VEGFR- mice. For example, they can include a table that documents mouse numbers at different age after birth to demonstrate if there is reduced viability overtime, instead of only giving a statement about a single time point. They can also point out if they have seen overt phenotypes reported by <a href=\"#bib6\">Fantin et al. 2014</a>, for example, have they ever seen evidence of cardiac failure in some of their knockin mice?"

Specifically, facial motor neurons express NRP1, and their migration during development is dependent on the presence of VEGF164 (Schwarz et al., 2004). According to the literature, <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mutants have a defect in which the migration of the facial motor neurons is disrupted. The phenotype was thought to be a result of VEGF-NRP1 binding in neurons because <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>Sema-</i></sup> and <i>Tie2-Cre;Nrp1</i><sup><i>fl/-</i></sup> mutants do not have this phenotype while VEGF-120 mice phenocopy the <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup>. With <i>in situ</i> hybridization for <i>Isl1</i>, we analyzed the migratory path of motor neurons at E12.5. To our surprise, we did not see a migration defect in the <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>VEGF-</i></sup> mutant. However, we also failed to see a migration defect in the neuronal-specific NRP1 knock-out (<i>Nestin-Cre,Nrp1</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup>) demonstrating that NRP1 is not required in neurons for this phenotype. In this regard, our data bring the claims of previous work into question and resolving this discrepancy is beyond the scope of our current manuscript. In addition, we also examined gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons because Carboni et al., 2011 showed that VEGF164 promotes the survival of migrating GnRH neurons by co-activating the ERK and AKT signaling pathways through NRP1. However, as with the facial motor neurons, we did not detect any GnRH survival phenotype in our <i>Nrp1</i><sup><i>VEGF-</i></sup> mutants."
