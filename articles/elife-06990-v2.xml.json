Viral infections by coxsackieviruses (CVB) may contribute to trigger autoimmunity in T1D. Cellular permissiveness to viral infection is modulated by innate antiviral responses, which vary among different cell types. We presently describe that global gene expression is similar in cytokine-treated and virus-infected human islet cells, with up-regulation of gene networks involved in cell autonomous immune responses. Comparison between the responses of rat pancreatic \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells to infection by CVB5 and 4 indicate that \u03b1 cells trigger a more efficient antiviral response than \u03b2 cells, including higher basal and induced expression of STAT1-regulated genes, and are thus better able to clear viral infections than \u03b2 cells. These differences may explain why pancreatic \u03b2 cells, but not \u03b1 cells, are targeted by an autoimmune response during T1D."

We presently describe that global gene expression is similar in cytokine-treated and virus-infected human islet cells, with up-regulation of gene networks involved in cell autonomous immune responses. Comparison between the responses of rat pancreatic \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells to infection by CVB5 and 4 indicate that \u03b1 cells trigger a more efficient antiviral response than \u03b2 cells, including higher basal and induced expression of STAT1-regulated genes, and are thus better able to clear viral infections than \u03b2 cells. These differences may explain why pancreatic \u03b2 cells, but not \u03b1 cells, are targeted by an autoimmune response during T1D."

As a result, individuals with type 1 diabetes must inject insulin to help their bodies process sugars. One of the mysteries of type 1 diabetes is why the beta cells in the pancreas are killed by the immune system while neighboring alpha cells, which produce the hormone glucagon, are spared."

For example, they may \u2018express\u2019 genes that are thought to increase the risk of type 1 diabetes, many of which control how the immune system responds to viral infections.

In initial experiments, clusters of cells\u2014known as islets\u2014from the human pancreas were either exposed to small proteins that cause inflammation or infected with the Coxsakievirus. Both events caused a similar increase in the expression of particular immune response genes in the islets. This indicates that these islet cells are able to react to the virus and trigger a first line of defense, which will be further boosted when the immune system is subsequently called into action."

The results revealed that alpha cells boost the expression of the genes needed to clear the virus to a greater extent than the beta cells, and so respond more efficiently to the virus. Therefore, an infection is more likely to establish itself in the beta cells and consequently trigger inflammation and the immune system's attack on the cells."

The disease is characterized by pancreatic islet inflammation (insulitis) and progressive \u03b2 cell loss by apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib62\">Ziegler and Nepom, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Morgan et al., 2014</a>). The triggering of T1D probably depends on environmental factors that interact with predisposing genes to induce autoimmunity against the \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eizirik et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Santin and Eizirik, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Morgan and Richardson, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Morgan et al., 2014</a>). Among the potential environmental factors, epidemiological, clinical, and pathological studies in humans support the implication of viral infections, particularly enteroviruses (e.g., coxsackievirus; CVB), as triggers for the development of T1D (<a href=\"#bib24\">Helfand et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dotta et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yeung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Morgan and Richardson, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Richardson et al., 2014</a>). CVB-specific antibodies and enteroviral RNA are more frequently observed in serum samples from T1D patients than in healthy individuals (<a href=\"#bib24\">Helfand et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lonnrot et al., 2000</a>), and staining of human pancreatic islets revealed that the enteroviral capsid protein VP1 is present at a higher frequency in insulin-containing islets from patients with recent-onset T1D when compared to healthy controls (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dotta et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Richardson et al., 2013</a>). A meta-analysis of 33 prevalence studies involving 1931 T1D cases and 2517 controls confirmed a clinically significant association between enteroviral infections and islet autoimmunity and T1D in humans (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yeung et al., 2011</a>). Additionally, it has been shown that the presence of enterovirus RNA (<a href=\"#bib41\">Oikarinen et al., 2011</a>) or antibodies anti-CVB1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Laitinen et al., 2014</a>) in blood can predict the development of T1D."

These proteins attract and stimulate cells of the immune system, such as macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eizirik et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Willcox et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arif et al., 2014</a>). The immune cells cause selective \u03b2 cell destruction both directly and via the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), type II interferon (IFN\u03b3), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. These cytokines are released closely to the target cells and modulate the expression of complex gene networks in \u03b2 cells, leading to the release of chemokines and eventually to the activation of the intrinsic pathway of cell death in \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eizirik et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gurzov and Eizirik, 2011</a>).

This perception underestimates the capacity of many non-immune cells to trigger \u2018self-defense\u2019 or \u2018cell autonomous immune responses\u2019 against infection. These mechanisms are pre-existing in many cell types and can be up-regulated upon virus infection (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yan and Chen, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Randow et al., 2013</a>). This is an ancient form of cellular protection, present both in bacteria and metazoans. In vertebrates, for instance, cellular self-defense synergizes with innate and adaptive immunity to fight infections (<a href=\"#bib44\">Randow et al., 2013</a>). The cell susceptibility/resistance of highly differentiated and poorly proliferating cells, such as neurons and pancreatic \u03b2 cells, to microbial infection is a major determinant of clinical outcome. It has been shown that cerebellum granule cell neurons and cortical neurons (CNs) have unique self-defense programs that confer differential resistance to infection by West Nile virus. Specifically, higher basal expression and faster up-regulation of IFN-induced genes improves the survival of granule cell neurons infected by West Nile virus (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cho et al., 2013</a>). These responses rely on detection of microbial signatures by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Randow et al., 2013</a>). Several candidate genes for T1D expressed in human islets, such as the RIG-like receptor <i>MDA5</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Colli et al., 2010</a>) and the regulators of type I IFNs <i>PTPN2</i> and <i>USP18</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Moore et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Colli et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Santin et al., 2012</a>), modulate viral detection, antiviral activity, and innate immunity. The candidate genes described above (<a href=\"#bib35\">Moore et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Colli et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Santin et al., 2012</a>) and CVB5 infection (<a href=\"#bib13\">Colli et al., 2011</a>) regulate \u03b2 cell apoptosis via activation of the BH3-only protein Bim. These observations support the concept that genetically modulated self-defense responses in \u03b2 cells might play an important role in determining the outbreak of insulitis and the progression to T1D in face of viral infection or other stimuli (<a href=\"#bib50\">Santin and Eizirik, 2013</a>)."

This conclusion generated two additional questions, namely whether this self-defense response is islet cell specific and, if yes, whether these putative cellular differences may explain the preferential \u03b2 cell targeting by the autoimmune assault. To answer these questions, we next compared the responses of FACS-purified rat pancreatic \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells to infection by potentially diabetogenic CVB5 and CVB4. The results obtained indicate that \u03b1 cells trigger a more effective antiviral response than \u03b2 cells, including higher basal and induced expression of STAT1-regulated genes, and are thus able to better clear viral infections as compared to \u03b2 cells."

It is presently not technically feasible to FACS-purify human \u03b2 and \u03b1 cells for long-term in vitro experiments due to the high-background fluorescence of human \u03b2 cells caused by marked lipofuscin accumulation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cnop et al., 2010</a>) and the putative impact of antibody-mediated techniques on the long-term survival and function of the sorted cells. These follow-up experiments were thus performed in FACS-purified rat \u03b2 and \u03b1 cells (&gt;90% pure cells and with &gt;90% viability after 4 days in culture; there was also similar expression of the housekeeping gene GAPDH between \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells under different experimental conditions; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Both \u03b2 and \u03b1 cells were killed to a same extent after a 24 hr exposure to different concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 + IFN\u03b3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that under the present experimental conditions FACS-purified rat \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells are similarly affected by cytokine-induced apoptosis. One of the mechanisms involved in cytokine-induced cell death is NO production (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eizirik and Mandrup-Poulsen, 2001</a>), and \u03b2 and \u03b1 cells showed roughly similar iNOS expression and medium nitrite accumulation, with slightly higher nitrite production by \u03b2 cells, but basal iNOS expression was higher in \u03b1 than \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Similarly, cytokines induced expression of the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL2 in both cell types, but CCL2 expression was higher in \u03b1 cells basally and following cytokine-exposure (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). In line with the cytokine data, the synthetic dsRNA polyinosinic-polycitidilic acid (PIC) induced a similar percentage of cell death in \u03b2 and \u03b1 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), but a slightly higher expression of the downstream genes IFN\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) and CCL2 (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>) in \u03b1 compared to \u03b2 cells. Furthermore, basal expression of the transcription factor STAT1, iNOS and of the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL2 was also higher in \u03b1 than in \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C,F</a>)."

                                "text": "In contrast with the observations made with cytokines and dsRNA (see above), infection of these cells with CVB5 at a multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) 5 induced death of nearly 50% of \u03b2 cells after 36 hr, but it did not increase \u03b1 cell death at this time point (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) or after a more prolonged follow-up (up to 96 hr) post-infection (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). UV-inactivated virus did not kill \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figures supplement 5</a>), indicating that cell death is the consequence of actual viral infection and proliferation. Additionally, there were no differences in the number of \u03b1 cells attached to the well before and after the infection (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), supporting the assumption that the \u03b1 cells remain alive after CVB5 infection. \u03b1 cells resistance was independent of the glucose/fetal bovine serum (FBS) concentration used in the medium (<a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7</a>), and it was paralleled by a markedly lower expression of the CVB5 marker VP1 in \u03b1 than in \u03b2 cells, as evaluated by mRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) and protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>) expression, and by titration of the production of infective virus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Dose-response experiments in \u03b1 cells indicated that even at a M.O.I. of 100, CVB5 still induced markedly less cell death in \u03b1 than in \u03b2 cells infected at an M.O.I. 20-fold lower, that is, M.O.I. 5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This is not a phenomenon restricted to CVB5, since \u03b1 cells were also much more resistant than \u03b2 cells to CVB4-induced cell death (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This cannot be explained by different expression of receptors for the virus, since the CVB receptors coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) and decay accelerating factor for complement have similar or higher mRNA expression in rat \u03b1 as compared to \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). The similar expression of CAR was confirmed at the protein level in \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figures supplement 1</a>). Consistently, the same quantity of CVB5 remained associated with \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells after adsorption of the virus as measured by titration 2 hr after virus exposure (data not shown). In line with these findings, the percentage of infected \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells by a non-replicating adenoviral vector encoding GFP, which also enters the cells via CAR, was similar in \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). On the other hand, the intensity of GFP fluorescence was several-fold lower in \u03b1 than in \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B,D</a>), indicating that the virus enters \u03b1 cells but cannot properly translate its cargo protein. These observations may explain a common knowledge in the field that \u03b1 cells are \u2018difficult to transduce\u2019 with adenoviral vectors."

Our present findings suggest an alternative hypothesis, namely that \u03b1 cells may become infected but are able to eradicate the virus more effectively than \u03b2 cells (see <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). If this hypothesis is correct, CVB infection should not be detectable in \u03b1 cells of T1D patients when their islets are examined months/years after the putative initial infection. To test whether CVB may indeed infect human \u03b1 cells, we first infected dispersed human islets from two donors (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) in vitro with CVB5 (M.O.I. 10) for 8 hr, the time point when maximum expression of VP1 was observed in a time-course experiment on \u03b1 cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). We detected by immunofluorescence the presence of the enteroviral capsid protein VP1 in both \u03b1 cells (glucagon-positive) and \u03b2 cells (insulin-positive) (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Thus, 52% (human islet sample 1) and 33% (human islet sample 2) insulin-positive cells were also positive for VP1, while 28% (human islet sample 1) or 27% (human islet sample 2) of cells were double positive for glucagon and VP1 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Similar results were observed with CVB4 (data not shown). To confirm these results in clinically relevant samples, we examined the pancreas of three children who died from myocarditis during the course of an acute and severe CVB infection. In these samples, we detected the presence of the enteroviral capsid protein, VP1, in \u03b2 cells in all three cases and in \u03b1 cells in two of three cases (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a> and <a href=\"#fig12s1\">Figure 12\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

From an evolutionary point of view, it would not make sense that these glucose-sensing and insulin-producing cells express these complex gene networks with the sole purpose to commit suicide during insulitis. The present observations, indicating a close similarity between cytokine- and virus-induced gene expression, suggest that these gene networks are actually part of a complex cell autonomous immune response, regulated at least in part by candidate genes for T1D (<a href=\"#bib50\">Santin and Eizirik, 2013</a>), aiming to eradicate putative viral infections without excessive cell loss. Indeed, \u03b2 cells, like neurons, have a very limited replication potential (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cnop et al., 2010</a>), and an excessive loss of \u03b2 cells would be disastrous for the host. In some genetically susceptible individuals, however, the putative initial viral infection might not be resolved leading to a persistent low-level infection, which in these individuals could trigger a specific autoimmune assault against \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dotta et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Santin and Eizirik, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Richardson et al., 2014</a>)."

If an islet viral infection, which in theory should affect all islet cells, contributes to trigger T1D, an important question arises; namely, why are \u03b2 cells killed while \u03b1 cells survive? It has been previously suggested that \u03b1 cells are more resistant to cytokine-induced apoptosis than \u03b2 cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mandrup-Poulsen et al., 1987</a>). The present observations, however, based on highly purified and viable rat \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells, cultured under similar conditions, indicate that both cell types are killed roughly to the same extent by the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 + IFN\u03b3. \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells are also equally susceptible to dsRNA-induced apoptosis, but \u03b1 cells are several-fold more resistant to CVB-induced infection and consequent cell death than \u03b2 cells. This suggests that the main difference between these two cell types is not their actual ability to detect signals of the viral infection (e.g., dsRNA) but how they respond to the virus once it is actively translating proteins inside the cells. In line with this hypothesis, both \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells were infected with an adenoviral vector encoding GFP, but \u03b1 cells efficiently blocked (by 90%) the translation of virally-encoded GFP. A limitation of the present study is that the experiments described above were performed in FACS-purifed rat \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells, which limits extrapolation to the human disease."

This suggests that this IFN-STAT1 gene network contributes to the resistance of \u03b1 cells to viral infection. In support of this hypothesis, KD of STAT1 prevents CVB-induced MX1 expression in \u03b1 cells and enables a more active infection with CVB5, as evaluated by higher expression of the enteroviral capsid protein VP1. Of note, unphosphorylated STAT1 supports the induction of antiviral genes in other cell types even without IFN-dependent stimulation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yang and Stark, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cheon and Stark, 2009</a>) and increased basal expression of STAT1 amplifies cell-intrinsic immune responses (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amit et al., 2009</a>)."

Our present findings, obtained in highly purified \u03b1 cells in vitro and by the analysis of dispersed human islets and pancreas from children with an acute and severe CVB infection, suggest an alternative hypothesis, namely that \u03b1 cells indeed get infected but they rapidly eradicate the virus, probably due to their enhanced cell autonomous immunity responses."

In this context, the continuous stimulation of vigorous antiviral responses, in an attempt to control the infection, may lead to protracted presentation of \u03b2 cell autoantigens, local release of chemokines and cytokines and eventually autoimmunity (<a href=\"#bib50\">Santin and Eizirik, 2013</a>).

The methods indicated by the editor and referees, i.e. labeling with fluorescent antibodies, recently used to sort \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells in pancreatic human islets (Dorrell et al., Stem Cell Res 183-194, 2008; Kirkpatrick et al., PLoS ONE e11053, 2010; Blodgett et al., Diabetes db150039, 2015) are indeed useful for studies involving RNA-seq or arrays of freshly isolated islet cells. They pose, however, a problem for the maintenance of the isolated cells in culture for several days after the purification, as required in the present study. Some of these methods require fixation of the cells, while others, where surface antibody are used without fixation, may affect cell function and trigger innate cellular responses secondary to antibody binding. Thus, and unfortunately, we presently cannot reproduce the current experiments based on viable and fully functional purified human \u03b2 and \u03b1 cells. In this context, the use of rodent FACS purified \u03b2 and \u03b1 cells provides a \u201csecond best\u201d alternative. Indeed, Benner et al. assessed transcriptome-wide similarities and differences between rodent and human \u03b2 cells, observing that 9905 genes are commonly expressed and 1540 differentially expressed between mouse and human \u03b2 cells (Benner et al. BMC Genomics 620, 2014). In line with this study, a very recent paper compared the core proteomes of rat and human pancreatic \u03b2 cells by label-free LC-MS/MS, quantifying more than 700 proteins belonging to key functional pathways, such as protein synthesis and intermediary metabolism (Martens GA, J Diabetes Res 549818, 2015). The authors describe that expression levels of these core functional pathways are highly conserved between rat and human \u03b2 cells, despite some differences in proteins involved in glucose sensing pathways and redox control. On the other hand, we are well aware that working with rodent rather than human \u03b2 cells present limitations, as these cells display structural and functional differences (Cabrera et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2334-2339, 2006; Henquin et al., Diabetes 3470-3477, 2006; Parnaud et al., Diabetologia 91-100, 2008)."

We have now introduced a sentence in the Introduction, last paragraph, explaining how these data shed light on the key questions of the paper. Of note, I (DLE) have presented lectures based on these data at the EASD and Immunology of Diabetes Society meetings, and in both cases the audience understood well our strategy of starting with gene expression signatures of cytokine- and viral-infected islet cells and then evolving to the subsequent questions, as done in the present manuscript."
