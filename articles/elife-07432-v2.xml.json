The single subunit remodeler Mot1 (modifier of transcription 1) dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP):DNA complexes, offering a useful system to address the structural mechanisms of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2). Our data show that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA as compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data suggest that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, thereby revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex."

The single subunit remodeler Mot1 (modifier of transcription 1) dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP):DNA complexes, offering a useful system to address the structural mechanisms of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2). Our data show that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA as compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data suggest that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, thereby revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex."

Cells use a number of methods to carefully control when particular genes are switched on or off. For example, proteins called transcription factors can activate a gene by binding to particular regions of DNA called promoters. One such transcription factor is called the TATA-binding protein (TBP for short). Mot1 is a remodeling enzyme that can form a \u201ccomplex\u201d with TBP by binding to it, and in doing so remove TBP from DNA. This silences the genes at those sites. The freed TBP can then bind to other promoters that lack Mot1 and activate the genes found there."

Binding to TBP and negative cofactor 2 causes the DNA molecule to bend; however, if Mot1 is also in the complex, the DNA becomes less bent. By making these changes, Mot1 is likely to prime TBP to detach from the DNA. Since the current structures do not yet reveal the atomic structure of Mot1\u2019s ATP dependent DNA motor domain, the next challenge is to visualize the entire complex at atomic resolution."

Swi2/Snf2 enzymes are best known as the principal catalytic subunits of large chromatin remodeling complexes that regulate the spatial arrangement and histone composition of nucleosomes, e.g. SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD, and INO80 remodelers (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gangaraju and Bartholomew, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>). Current models propose that Swi2/Snf2 ATPases track the minor groove of DNA, thereby generating tension that induces transient or permanent alterations in molecular assemblies (<a href=\"#bib71\">Saha et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Whitehouse et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Zofall et al., 2006</a>). Although high-resolution structures of some Swi2/Snf2 domains and their substrate-interacting domains associated with DNA and protein have been previously described, detailed structural information about these ATPases bound to substrate proteins and DNA is largely absent (<a href=\"#bib28\">D\u00fcrr et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Thom\u00e4 et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Shaw et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hauk et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Sharma et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Yamada et al., 2011</a>). The lack of structural insights is owed to the complex, often multisubunit architecture of Swi2/Snf2 enzyme-containing complexes and their inherent structural flexibilities."

                        "text": "Mot1 (modifier of transcription 1, also denoted BTAF1) is conserved from protozoa to humans and was the first Swi2/Snf2 member for which the biochemical activity has been demonstrated in vitro (<a href=\"#bib7\">Auble and Hahn, 1993</a>). Mot1 dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP) from DNA in an ATP-dependent manner, thereby directly regulating transcription initiation process and global redistribution of TBP in the cell (<a href=\"#bib7\">Auble and Hahn, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Dasgupta et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Darst et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</a>). In contrast to the majority of other Swi2/Snf2 enzymes, Mot1 does not require any associated subunit for its essential activity and serves as a useful model system for studying Swi2/Snf2 enzymes in vitro<i>.</i> The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of <i>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</i> Mot1 (Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>) in complex with TBP showed that Mot1 consists of 16 HEAT repeats (Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, lipid kinase TOR) that are arranged in a horseshoe-like shape (<a href=\"#bib92\">Wollmann et al., 2011</a>). Of note was that a long loop between HEAT repeats 2 and 3, denoted as the \u2018latch\u2019, can bind to TBP's concave site and block TBP\u2013DNA association. Therefore, previous analyses have revealed not only how Mot1 binds TBP, but also that Mot1 functions as a TBP chaperone. Numerous biochemical and more recent structural studies of the Mot1:TBP complex predicted the approximate positioning of the ATPase domain (Mot1<sup>CTD</sup>) with respect to the DNA upstream of the TATA box (<a href=\"#bib7\">Auble and Hahn, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Auble et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Darst et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Gumbs et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Sprouse et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Wollmann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2012</a>). A limitation of our previous work on Mot1:TBP was the finding that the crystallized state evidently represents the \u2018product\u2019 state after the remodeling reaction took place, but it remained unclear how Mot1 directly impacts the TBP:DNA \u2018substrate\u2019 state prior to the remodeling reaction (<a href=\"#bib92\">Wollmann et al., 2011</a>). Obtaining a substrate state with DNA and TBP turned out to be difficult because Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> can disrupt TBP:DNA by its latch. However, we found that the Mot1:TBP:DNA complex is much more stable in the presence of negative cofactor 2 (NC2), another global transcriptional regulator, whose occurrence coincides with Mot1 and TBP at many genomic locations (<a href=\"#bib5\">Andrau et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Dasgupta et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Hsu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Van Werven et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Spedale et al., 2012</a>). NC2 is a heterodimer composed of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits, which highly resemble histones H2A and H2B, respectively (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kamada et al., 2001</a>). We crystallized <i>E. cuniculi</i> Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> in complex with TBP, NC2, and a TATA promoter DNA fragment and present here the crystal structure of this complex at 3.8 \u00c5 resolution along with biochemical, electron microscopy, and cross-linking studies of the full-length Mot1 complex. Our study provides the first pseudoatomic view of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with a DNA:protein substrate complex."

In contrast, human NC2 was reported to replace the human Mot1 homolog BTAF1 bound to TBP:DNA complexes (<a href=\"#bib52\">Klejman et al., 2004</a>). These observations prompted us to explore whether <i>E. cuniculi</i> Mot1, TBP, NC2\u03b1, and NC2\u03b2 form a stable complex with DNA in vitro. In line with the results demonstrated in the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> system (<a href=\"#bib21\">Darst et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Van Werven et al., 2008</a>), we were able to reconstitute the Mot1:TBP:NC2\u03b1:NC2\u03b2 complex in the presence of a TATA box consensus sequence-containing oligonucleotide and to purify it by gel filtration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> also formed a stable complex with TBP, NC2, and DNA (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). From these data, it appears that complex formation between Mot1, TBP, and NC2 on TATA DNA is evolutionary conserved. Furthermore, specific interactions between Mot1 and TBP\u2014and not for instance interactions between the Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> and the DNA\u2014are sufficient for formation of the pentameric complex."

However, we were not able to detect any significant changes in the Mot1-catalyzed TBP:DNA dissociation rate or the ATP hydrolysis rate of this process in the presence of NC2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Taken together, these data show that the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex is a bona fide substrate of Mot1's remodeling activity. Moreover, in contrast to the TBP:DNA substrates, the ATPase domain is necessary to disrupt the NC2-containing complexes."

To capture how Mot1 binds its \u2018substrate\u2019 TBP:DNA complex, i.e., the interaction that is formed before the remodeling reaction takes place, we performed extensive crystallization experiments. Owing to the inherent instability of the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:TBP:DNA complex, we obtained only Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:TBP crystals. However, the addition of NC2 efficiently stabilized the \u2018substrate\u2019 complex and we obtained crystals from selenomethionine-derivatized proteins diffracting to 3.8 \u00c5 resolution that contained all five components: Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>, TBP, NC2\u03b1, NC2\u03b2, and 24 base-paired TATA box-containing DNA.

Mot1 and NC2 occupy opposite binding surfaces on TBP and completely encircle the DNA-bound TBP molecule, which recognizes the minor groove of the TATA sequence. The Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> is oriented towards the upstream DNA (the 5\u2019 end of the TATA box-containing strand) and predominantly binds the convex (\u2018top\u2019) side of TBP. Furthermore, like in the human TBP:DNA:NC2 complex, NC2 locks TBP onto the promoter utilizing its histone fold domain (NC2<sup>HF</sup>), which is bound to the underside of the DNA, and the C-terminal helix <i>H5</i> of NC2\u03b2, which reaches around the DNA and binds the convex side of TBP (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kamada et al., 2001</a>). Of note is that no interpretable electron density of the Mot1 latch residues 98\u2013142 is observed. Therefore, it is probable that the latch is ordered only after binding to TBP's DNA-binding surface. Taken together, the <i>E. cuniculi</i> Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:TBP:DNA:NC2 crystal structure shows a high degree of evolutionary conservation of the TBP:NC2 interaction on a structural level. Moreover, the encircling of TBP:DNA by NC2 explains the resistance of Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex to premature dissociation caused by the latch."

Although the contacts of Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> and NC2 within the complex are mainly TBP- and/or DNA-mediated, which is consistent with the lack of a stable interaction between Mot1 and NC2 in the absence of DNA in vitro (data not shown), we observed several notable conformational differences. In comparison with the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:TBP \u2018product\u2019 state, the interaction between the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> and the convex site of TBP prominently extends towards the C-terminus of Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>, engaging HEAT repeats 4 to 10 and the insertion domain. Additionally, the \u2018anchor\u2019 helix <i>H5</i> of NC2\u03b2 bound to the upper side of TBP contacts the insertion domain of Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>, the only non-HEAT repeat stretch in the N-terminal part of Mot1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). As a result, the interaction interface between Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> and TBP's convex surface increases dramatically from \u223c900 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> to \u223c1500 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, as calculated using the PISA server (<a href=\"#bib56\">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</a>), thus suggesting that Mot1 might even have a tighter grip on TBP in the presence of NC2. The additional interactions between the loops and structural elements of the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> and TBP result in a considerable compaction of the \u03b1-helical HEAT repeat array. Therefore, since the capability to rearrange was shown to be an essential property of long \u03b1-helical solenoids, shape adaptation and conformational changes of the Mot1's HEAT domain might play an important role in the dissociation mechanism (<a href=\"#bib36\">Gr\u00fcnwald et al., 2013</a>)."

This observation is of potential importance since the upstream part of DNA binds to the Mot1's Swi2/Snf2 domain, which immediately follows the C-terminus of Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Auble and Hahn, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Auble et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Sprouse et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Darst et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Wollmann et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, the linker helix <i>H4</i> of NC2\u03b2 adopts a partially unfolded conformation and its interaction with the major groove of the downstream DNA is lost (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Thus, Mot1 might influence the C-terminal stirrup of TBP indirectly via interaction with NC2. (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Moreover, due to the changed DNA geometry, NC2<sup>HF</sup> is moved and rotated with respect to TBP. Despite this change, the direct interaction between the NC2<sup>HF</sup> and DNA does not seem to be affected and is similar to the interaction of histones H2A/H2B with DNA in the nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib58\">Luger et al., 1997</a>). However, it has to be noted that both sides of the DNA molecule are engaged in the formation of crystal contacts; thereby, we cannot exclude the possibility that the DNA conformation is affected by crystal packing. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that crystal lattice formation can entirely explain the change in DNA trajectory (see \u2018Discussion\u2019). In summary, in the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex crystal structure, we observe a variety of small to medium conformational changes. The observed changes indicate reduced strength of the TBP\u2013DNA and DNA\u2013NC2 interactions as well as stabilization of Mot1\u2013TBP interface due to Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> binding."

Most of the cross-links could be placed within the crystal structure or within the Mot1<sup>CTD</sup>. The cross-links that were detected between the latch (Lys115 or Lys138) and other components could not be mapped since the latch is disordered in the crystal structure. The latch formed contacts with TBP, Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> as well as NC2<sup>HF</sup>, consistent with its high flexibility even in the context of full-length Mot1. The remaining cross-links were detected between Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> and the rest of the complex. As an example, in all data sets, we found numerous cross-links between the Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> and NC2<sup>HF</sup>, mainly between the helix Hc and loop L2 (joining helices H3 and Hc) of NC2\u03b1 and RecA2 subdomain of Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

                                "text": "As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, in the crystal structures of Swi2/Snf2 ATPase domains, the two RecA-fold subdomains were observed to adopt a variety of different positions with respect to each other, ranging from \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018semi-closed\u2019 to \u2018closed\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib28\">D\u00fcrr et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Thom\u00e4 et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Shaw et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hauk et al., 2010</a>). Importantly, on the basis of related SF2 helicases, ATP was shown to bind to the interface of the RecA-fold subdomains and stabilize a \u2018closed\u2019 state (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sengoku et al., 2006</a>). The CX-MS approach can provide insights into the architecture of protein complexes with domain to motif resolution (<a href=\"#bib64\">Nguyen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Tosi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Politis et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, to gain insights into the conformation of the Swi2/Snf2 domain in different nucleotide states, we analyzed the 32 cross-links that we detected between the two RecA-fold subdomains within Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> and mapped them onto homology models of Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> in different conformations, based on \u2018open\u2019, \u2018semi-closed\u2019 and \u2018closed\u2019 states. Among these cross-links, 18 do not distinguish between these conformations, since they are all either below (14) or above (4) the distance cutoff of 30 \u00c5, which accounts for the length of the cross-linker and two lysine side chains (<a href=\"#bib69\">Politis et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> part A). From the cross-links, which do distinguish between the conformations, two were present in all three data sets (ADP, ATP\u03b3S, ADP\u00b7BeF<sub>x</sub>) and are thus non-informative (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> part B). However, the remaining 4 cross-link sites (8 cross-links total) were detected only in the presence of ADP\u00b7BeF<sub>x</sub> and ATP\u03b3S (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> part C). Notably, all of these cross-links, which were absent from the ADP data set, are only consistent with the \u2018closed\u2019 conformation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, our data suggest that the ATP-mimicking ADP\u00b7BeF<sub>x</sub> and ATP\u03b3S analogs stabilize a more \u2018closed\u2019 conformation. Since we did not detect any cross-links that would be unique for the ADP-supplied sample, whether Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> adopts a distinct state in the presence of this nucleotide or is simply more flexible remains to be addressed in future studies."

                                "text": "We next visualized the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex by electron microscopy. We calculated a negative stain reconstruction of the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex in the presence of ADP\u00b7BeF<sub>X</sub> and experimentally determined its handedness (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The 22 \u00c5 reconstruction, of overall dimensions of 115 \u00c5 \u00d7 115 \u00c5 \u00d7 100 \u00c5, is in good agreement with the size of the partial complex observed in the crystal structure. Due to better resolution, the characteristic \u201bC\u2019-shaped structure of Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> is more pronounced than in the reconstruction of the <i>E. cuniculi</i> Mot1:TBP and <i>H. sapiens</i> BTAF1:TBP complexes (<a href=\"#bib66\">Pereira et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Wollmann et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, to place the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:TBP:DNA:NC2 crystal structure model into the EM density, we employed an unsupervised rigid body docking approach using the <i>Situs</i> software package (<a href=\"#bib93\">Wriggers, 2010</a>), which resulted in a convincing solution (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The prominent and centered additional density, which is localized in the immediate vicinity of the N- and C-terminal ends of Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> (the \u2018gap\u2019 of the horseshoe), likely harbors the C-terminal Swi2/Snf2 domain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). To assess the placement of Mot1<sup>CTD</sup>, we again used our CX-MS data. Using <i>RANCH</i> (<a href=\"#bib67\">Petoukhov et al., 2012</a>)<i>,</i> we first generated a set of 20,000 theoretical Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 assemblies allowing flexible movement of the eight amino acid linker joining the Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> model and Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>. As suggested by the interpretation of the CX-MS data, for this analysis we used the Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> modeled in the \u2018closed\u2019 conformation. On each of the computed models, we next mapped all of the non-redundant cross-links between Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> and the rest of the complex.

The release of TBP from DNA by Mot1, however, does not appear to involve highly processive ATP-dependent DNA tracking (<a href=\"#bib9\">Auble and Steggerda, 1999</a>). The changes in the TBP:DNA and NC2:DNA interactions observed in the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:TBP:DNA:NC2 crystal structure suggest that Mot1<sup>NTD</sup> binding leads to an alteration of the interaction with promoter DNA. Such a potential destabilization\u2014due to the ring that is formed around DNA by TBP and NC2\u2014does not generally result in removal from TBP from DNA, consistent with our biochemical observations. However, it is possible that TBP:NC2 has an increased lateral mobility on DNA. Interestingly, in single-molecule experiments, NC2 induces dynamic conformational changes in the TBP:DNA interface, enabling TBP to laterally move on DNA substrates (<a href=\"#bib73\">Schluesche et al., 2007</a>). Consequently, NC2-induced lateral mobility of TBP was proposed to explain how NC2, by sliding TBP, could lead to TBP repositioning from/towards the promoter sites. Although the underlying conformational changes have not been seen in the TBP:DNA:NC2 crystal structure, our structural analysis indeed indicates changes in the DNA trajectory that are consistent with increased lateral mobility. Thus, the analysis of our structural data suggested two models for the observed dissociation of the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex in the presence of ATP. One possibility is that Mot1 uses a Swi2/Snf2 translocase activity to translocate the TBP:NC2 ring along DNA like a sliding clamp without disrupting it. In our EMSAs, the complex would eventually dissociate from DNA when the DNA end is reached. Alternatively, Mot1-induced conformational changes in the TBP:DNA:NC2 substrate could directly dissociate the complex from DNA without translocation along the DNA. To distinguish between these two options, we performed EMSAs using digoxygenin-labeled DNA, the ends of which were blocked with an anti-digoxygenin antibody. The DNA probes used were not much longer than the minimal DNA required for the formation of the complex, consisting of just 30 bp of DNA upstream of the TATA box and 9 bp of DNA downstream. As shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, we observed no significant impact of the presence or placement of antibody block on either side of the DNA on the efficiency of the remodeling reaction. Therefore, in this setting Mot1 does not appear to apply highly processive sliding of TBP:NC2 along DNA but rather utilizes a more direct, local disruption mechanism consistent with previous studies of TBP\u2013DNA complexes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Auble and Steggerda, 1999</a>). Since NC2 and TBP encircle the DNA and do not interact in the absence of DNA, Mot1 likely disrupts the TBP:NC2 interaction as well."

ATP hydrolysis-dependent translocation of the Swi2/Snf2 ATPase domain could provide most if not all of the chemomechanical force, but a question is whether binding of the remodeler induces conformational changes in the target. Indeed, we find that the association of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex results in some unexpected conformational changes that may have implications for understanding the ATP-dependent dissociation mechanism. Binding of Mot1 leads to subtle but consistent conformational changes between substrate proteins and DNA, which could prime the complex for ATP-dependent disruption. Although the interface between Mot1 and NC2 that we observe in the crystal structure of the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex is arguably very small, the contact between Mot1's insertion domain and NC2 could help separate NC2's main TBP anchor helix <i>H5</i> from TBP and <i>H4</i> from DNA. In support of this, the very C-terminal unstructured region of NC2\u03b2 following helix <i>H5</i> has been previously shown to be responsible for the repressive role of NC2 (<a href=\"#bib96\">Yeung et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Yeung et al., 1997</a>)."

However, consistent with the observation that Mot1-induced dynamic DNA behavior in the TBP:DNA complex occurs also on DNA templates which are too short to directly contact the ATPase domain (<a href=\"#bib61\">Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2012</a>), we propose that even minimal Mot1-dependent conformational changes could have a critical impact on the TBP\u2013TATA box interaction, especially as the severely bent TATA box itself might accelerate dissociation by acting as a \u2018spring\u2019 for rapid release of TBP (<a href=\"#bib83\">Tora and Timmers, 2010</a>).

While Mot1 forms a stable complex with DNA-bound TBP and NC2, it is fully capable of disrupting this complex in the presence of ATP. Thus, our data suggest that the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex is not only a <i>bona fide</i> but perhaps even preferential substrate for Mot1. It is possible that NC2 marks the TBP-containing complexes for Mot1-catalyzed disassembly, e.g., to prevent the formation of aberrant transcription preinitiation complexes on intragenic regions (<a href=\"#bib86\">Van Werven et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Spedale et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Koster et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Koster and Timmers, 2015</a>). In this context, it is important to note that NC2, similarly to histones, has been shown to undergo phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination in vivo (<a href=\"#bib26\">Dephoure et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Van Hoof et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Huttlin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Kim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Alcolea et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Wagner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Guo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sharma et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, the impact of NC2 modifications on Mot1 recruitment and activity needs to be further investigated, especially given that the remodeling activity of Swi2/Snf2 family members can be controlled by post-translational modification of histone substrates or remodeler subunits themselves (<a href=\"#bib18\">Clapier et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ferreira et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Dutta et al., 2014</a>)."

The position of Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> relative to NC2<sup>HF</sup> in our CX-MS- and EM-derived models is analogous to the association of a Swi2/Snf2 domain bound to superhelical location 2 (SHL2), i.e., in direct proximity to the H3/H4 histone pair slightly away from the dyad axis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dang and Bartholomew, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dechassa et al., 2012</a>). Notably, most of the cross-links between the Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> and NC2<sup>HF</sup> map to the protrusion region of the RecA2-like subdomain, the major family-specific insertion region of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases (<a href=\"#bib32\">Flaus et al., 2006</a>). A general role for the Swi2/Snf2 protrusions in distorting local DNA structure has been proposed (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hauk and Bowman, 2011</a>). For example, Snf2 has been suggested to disturb histone:DNA contacts by wedging the RecA2 lobe between DNA and protein substrates (<a href=\"#bib25\">Dechassa et al., 2012</a>). In our model, the Swi2/Snf2 protrusions, especially from the RecA2 subdomain, are well positioned to directly affect DNA and NC2:DNA contacts. Therefore, the close proximity of the Mot1 Swi2/Snf2 domain to the NC2 histone fold reveals interesting parallels to the proposed interactions of nucleosome remodelers and histones (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), although more detailed structural investigation is necessary to elucidate the extent to which these architectures are conserved or distinct."

Our structural analyses suggest a two-step mechanism for the remodeling of TBP:DNA:NC2 by Mot1 that could be relevant for other remodelers that act on histone fold protein substrates. It seems plausible to reason that in the first step, TBP's and NC2's interaction with DNA is destabilized by Mot1 binding in an ATP-independent manner. ATP binding does not result in the disassembly of the complex. The formation of the Mot1<sup>NTD</sup>:NC2 clamp ensures robust dependence on ATP hydrolysis, which triggers the final dissociation step, and which most probably occurs by very short-range translocation of the Swi2/Snf2 domain along the minor groove. Considering the relative orientation of Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> and DNA in our model as well as the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 tracking direction shown for other Swi2/Snf2 enzymes (<a href=\"#bib90\">Whitehouse et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Zofall et al., 2006</a>), Mot1 may move along upstream DNA towards TBP, disrupting the TBP:promoter interaction."

The resulting volume was furthermore assessed using different approaches (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The complex sample at 0.66 mg/ml was supplemented with 1 mM ATP\u03b3S, 1 mM ADP, or 1 mM ADP\u00b7BeF<sub>X</sub> (formed by mixing ADP, BeCl<sub>2</sub> and NaF in 1:1:4 molar ratio). An equimolar mixture of isotopically light (d0)- and heavy (d6)-labeled disulfosuccinimidyl glutarate (DSSG; Creative Molecules, Canada) was dissolved in H<sub>2</sub>O at a concentration of 50 mM. 55 \u00b5g of protein complex were incubated with DSSG (0.32 mM final concentration) for 35 min at 30\u00b0C (1000 rpm). The reaction was quenched by adding 1 M Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 100 mM, followed by incubation for further 15 min at 30\u00b0C (1000 rpm). The cross-linking efficiency was visualized by SDS-PAGE in combination with silver staining following standard protocols (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Proteins were in the following digested using a standard in-solution protocol. In brief, proteins were denatured by adding two volumes of 8 M urea (Sigma-Aldrich). Cross-linked proteins were reduced with 5 mM final concentration tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, Thermo Scientific, Germany) for 45 min at 35\u00b0C and subsequently alkylated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature (10 mM iodoacetamide final concentration). Proteins were pre-digested for 2 hr with lysyl endopeptidase (LysC, Wako, Germany) at 35\u00b0C at an enzyme-substrate ratio of 1\u201350 (wt/wt). The protein solution was diluted with four volumes of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), and a second digest was performed overnight with trypsin (Promega, Germany, 1/50 [wt/wt] at 35\u00b0C, 1000 rpm). Peptides were acidified with 1% (vol/vol) trifuoroacetic acid (TFA, Sigma\u2013Aldrich) and purified by solid-phase extraction using C18 cartridges (Sep-Pak, Waters, Germany). The desalted eluate was dried by vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in 20 \u00b5l of size exclusion chromatography mobile phase (25% acetonitrile [ACN], 0.1% TFA). 15 \u00b5l hereof was injected into a GE Healthcare \u00c4KTAmicro chromatography system via autosampler. Peptides were separated on a Superdex Peptide PC 3.2/30 column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 25 \u00b5l/min. 100 \u00b5l fractions were collected in a 96-well plate over a separation window of one column volume.

A key aspect of transcriptional regulation and activation is recycling of TATA binding protein (TBP). This recycling is stimulated by the Snf2-type ATPase Mot1. This study builds on previous work by the authors in which they crystallized the HEAT repeat containing N-terminal domain of Mot1 bound to TBP alone. The authors refer to this as representing the \u201cproduct state\u201d. In this work, to characterize the \u201csubstrate state\u201d, the authors solve the crystal structure of the Mot1 N-terminal domain bound to a complex of TBP, DNA and the transcriptional regulator NC2. They provide complementary structural and biochemical analysis to generate a model for the complete Mot1 protein bound to TBP-NC2-DNA. Based on cross-linking mass-spec data and negative stain EM data on full-length Mot1 bound to TBP\u2013DNA\u2013NC2, the authors suggest how the ATPase domain may engage the substrate. Biochemical data are presented to assess how the presence of NC2 affects Mot1 function. The authors present a model in which Mot1 binding to TBP-DNA-NC2 causes an ATP-independent distortion of the DNA that poises the complex for further ATP-dependent destabilization. In this model, interactions between Mot1 and NC2 are coupled to the DNA distortion and the latch domain of the Mot1 N-terminus binds to the DNA-binding surface of TBP to promote full dissociation of TBP from the DNA. The authors further speculate based on cross-linking data that the RecA2-like subdomain of Mot1 may directly affect NC2-DNA contacts."

Specifically, the authors suggest that interactions between NC2 and the Mot1 N-term observed in the crystal structure and the proposed interactions between the RecA2-like lobe and NC2 HF region inferred from cross-linking data may, together, provide a model for how nucleosome remodelers disrupt histone-DNA interactions."

All of these cross-links were detected in both the ADP\u00b7BeF<sub>x</sub> and ATP\u03b3S data sets or exclusively in the ADP\u00b7BeF<sub>x</sub> data set. Remarkably, all of them are consistent with the \u201cclosed\u201d conformation and not with the \u201copen\u201d or \u201csemi-closed\u201d. Thus, our cross-linking data supports the finding that in the presence of ATP-mimicking nucleotides RecA-like subdomains of Mot1<sup>CTD</sup> adopt \u201cclosed\u201d conformation. This conclusion is stated in the revised manuscript. The placement of these cross-links was also depicted in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>.

In <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 2</a> we showed only the inter-subdomain, and not as before both inter- and intra-subdomain cross-links.

Our dissociation experiments represented by EMSA shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> were designed to distinguish between Mot1 sliding the TBP:NC2 clamp along the DNA over <i>long distances</i> using its Swi2/Snf2 translocase domain or alternatively <i>local</i> disruption of Mot1:TBP:NC2 complex. The tracking of Mot1:TBP was tested before and it was found that Mot1 does not track (<a href=\"#bib9\">Auble and Steggerda, 1999</a>). However, TBP in complex with NC2 forms a sliding clamp (<a href=\"#bib73\">Schluesche et al., 2007</a>), so it is plausible that Mot1:TBP:NC2 tracks, instead of just dissociating. In a physiological context, tracking could redistribute TBP:NC2 in <i>cis</i>, while an immediate dissociation could redistribute it in trans (e.g. to different promoters). Our experiment shows that the mechanism employing long-distance processive tracking as shown for chromatin remodeling enzymes (<a href=\"#bib71\">Saha et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Whitehouse et al., 2003</a>) is not likely to occur in the Mot1:TBP:NC2 system. We believe that Mot1 disrupts TBP and TBP:NC2 via a non-processive mechanism, e.g. by 1 or a few bp \u201ctranslocation\u201d, which in principle would be enough to dissociate the protein substrates from a highly constrained DNA. We have used two different DNA substrates that had the antibody block placed on either end to test for both possible tracking directions. We hope that the revised manuscript clarifies this concern."
