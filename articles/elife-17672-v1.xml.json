Whether alternative splicing contributes to metabolic regulation is largely unknown. Here we investigated the contribution of alternative splicing to the development of diet-induced obesity. We found that obesity-induced changes in adipocyte gene expression include alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Bioinformatics analysis associated part of this alternative splicing program with sequence specific NOVA splicing factors. This conclusion was confirmed by studies of mice with NOVA deficiency in adipocytes. Phenotypic analysis of the NOVA-deficient mice demonstrated increased adipose tissue thermogenesis and improved glycemia. We show that NOVA proteins mediate a splicing program that suppresses adipose tissue thermogenesis. Together, these data provide quantitative analysis of gene expression at exon-level resolution in obesity and identify a novel mechanism that contributes to the regulation of adipose tissue function and the maintenance of normal glycemia."

Whether alternative splicing contributes to metabolic regulation is largely unknown. Here we investigated the contribution of alternative splicing to the development of diet-induced obesity. We found that obesity-induced changes in adipocyte gene expression include alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Bioinformatics analysis associated part of this alternative splicing program with sequence specific NOVA splicing factors. This conclusion was confirmed by studies of mice with NOVA deficiency in adipocytes. Phenotypic analysis of the NOVA-deficient mice demonstrated increased adipose tissue thermogenesis and improved glycemia. We show that NOVA proteins mediate a splicing program that suppresses adipose tissue thermogenesis. Together, these data provide quantitative analysis of gene expression at exon-level resolution in obesity and identify a novel mechanism that contributes to the regulation of adipose tissue function and the maintenance of normal glycemia."

Indeed, differences in pre-mRNA splicing can contribute to the specialization of different cell types within the body (<a href=\"#bib50\">Vaquero-Garcia et al., 2016</a>). The regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing is therefore an important aspect of cellular differentiation. Indeed, processes that regulate pre-mRNA splicing represent potential mechanisms that can control cell function. Recent studies have identified changes in pre-mRNA splicing associated with autism (<a href=\"#bib18\">Irimia et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Weyn-Vanhentenryck et al., 2014</a>), cardiac hypertrophy (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mirtschink et al., 2015</a>), embryonic stem cell re-programming (<a href=\"#bib15\">Han et al., 2013a</a>), tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Oltean and Bates, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hsu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Koh et al., 2015</a>), and the regulation of signal transduction pathways (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gupta et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tournier et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Maimon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Martinez et al., 2015</a>).

Adipose tissue is critically important for whole body metabolic regulation because it acts as both an endocrine organ and as a storage depot for triglyceride (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</a>). Interestingly, both adipose tissue deficiency (lipodystrophy) and adipose tissue accumulation (obesity) are associated with the development of metabolic syndrome and pre-diabetes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Grundy, 2015</a>). Moreover, the widespread incidence of human obesity represents a major risk factor for the development of diabetes and mortality (<a href=\"#bib11\">Flegal et al., 2013</a>). It is therefore important that we obtain an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control adipocyte function."

The genes <i>Mapk8</i> (encodes the JNK1 protein kinase) and <i>Mapk9</i> (encodes the JNK2 protein kinase) express pre-mRNA are alternatively spliced by the\u00a0mutually exclusive inclusion of either exon 7a or 7b to yield the \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms of the JNK1 and JNK2 protein kinases (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gupta et al., 1996</a>). The sequences surrounding exons 7a and 7b contain consensus sites for NOVA binding (YCAY) that are established to be NOVA binding sites by CLIP-seq analysis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Licatalosi et al., 2008</a>). We designed and validated a Taqman assay to quantitate the inclusion of exon 7a or 7b sequences in <i>Mapk8</i> mRNA (<i>Mapk8\u03b1</i> and <i>Mapk8\u03b2</i>) and <i>Mapk9</i> mRNA (<i>Mapk9\u03b1</i> and <i>Mapk9\u03b2</i>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). This analysis demonstrated that adipocytes and hepatocytes express different alternatively spliced JNK isoforms (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These tissue-specific differences in <i>Mapk8/9</i> pre-mRNA splicing may be influenced by the selective expression of NOVA proteins in adipocytes, but not hepatocytes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3A</a>), although NOVA-independent mechanisms likely also contribute to the observed cell type-specific pattern of JNK isoform expression."

We found that hepatic expression of NOVA2 caused a decrease in the <i>Mapk8\u03b1/\u03b2</i> ratio and an increase in the <i>Mapk9\u03b1/\u03b2</i> ratio, indicating that NOVA can promote the expression of the <i>Mapk8\u03b2</i> and <i>Mapk9\u03b1</i> alternatively spliced isoforms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In contrast, adipocyte-specific deficiency of NOVA1 plus NOVA2 caused an increase in the <i>Mapk8\u03b1/\u03b2</i> ratio and a decrease in the <i>Mapk9\u03b1/\u03b2</i> ratio, indicating that NOVA-deficiency promotes the expression of the <i>Mapk8\u03b1</i> and <i>Mapk9\u03b2</i> alternatively spliced isoforms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These observations are consistent with the finding that HFD consumption causes both decreased NOVA expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>) and significant changes in the mutually exclusive inclusion of <i>Mapk8</i> exons 7a and 7b (<i>FDR</i>=0.0066). Together, these data demonstrate that NOVA proteins can promote the expression of the <i>Mapk8\u03b2</i> and <i>Mapk9\u03b1</i> isoforms."

Studies using the substrate cJun demonstrate low activity (JNK1\u03b1 and JNK2\u03b2) and high activity (JNK1\u03b2 and JNK2\u03b1) groups of JNK protein kinases in vitro (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and in vivo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Since NOVA can promote the expression of <i>Mapk8\u03b2</i> and <i>Mapk9\u03b1</i> mRNA that encode the high activity forms of JNK1 and JNK2, NOVA-deficiency can be predicted to cause expression of the low activity forms JNK1\u03b1 and JNK2\u03b2 in adipocytes. To test this conclusion, we prepared primary adipocytes from F<sup>WT</sup> and F<sup>\u2206N1,2</sup> mice and examined stress-induced JNK activation. No differences in JNK expression or stress-induced activating phosphorylation (pThr<sup>180</sup>-Pro-pTyr<sup>182</sup>) of JNK between F<sup>WT</sup> and F<sup>\u2206N1,2</sup> adipocytes were detected by immunoblot analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). However, stress-induced phosphorylation of the JNK substrate pSer<sup>63</sup> cJun was markedly suppressed in F<sup>\u2206N1,2</sup> adipocytes compared with F<sup>WT</sup> adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>).

The significance of the decrease in adipocyte NOVA expression in HFD-fed mice is therefore unclear. Nevertheless, our data establish that NOVA proteins in adipocytes function to suppress adipose tissue thermogenesis. The mechanism appears to be mediated by NOVA-regulated changes in pre-mRNA splicing that promote adipocyte thermogenic gene expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), but we cannot exclude additional contributions caused by other biochemical actions of NOVA proteins, including alternative mRNA polyadenylation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Licatalosi et al., 2008</a>) and functional regulation of Argonaute/microRNA complexes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Storchel et al., 2015</a>).

Second, our analysis of mice with NOVA-deficiency in adipocytes implicates a role for NOVA proteins in the alternative splicing of 26% of the genes that are regulated by HFD consumption (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

The UCSC liftOver utility was used to convert the NOVA CLIP-seq tag coordinates from the mm9-based assembly to the mm10/GRCm38 assembly. The coordinates for the NOVA CLIP-seq tags were sorted based on chromosome and start position. Custom PERL scripts (<a href=\"#SD15-data\">Source code 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD16-data\">2</a>) were used to extract three groups of genomic regions: (1) statistically significant differentially expressed alternatively spliced exons (<i>FDR</i>&lt;0.05 and the absolute inclusion level difference &gt;0.1) (n = 1631); (2) exons not meeting statistical significance (<i>FDR</i>\u22650.05) (n = 11,490); and (3) randomly selected regions of the mouse genome comprising 100\u00a0bp (n = 10,000). The coordinates for each genomic region were expanded to include an additional 500\u00a0bp of sequence flanking the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of the genomic region. If an exon belongs to a gene comprising one or more alternatively spliced exons with <i>FDR</i>&lt;0.5 and one or more alternatively spliced exons with <i>FDR</i>\u22650.05, the exon was excluded from the second group. In each group, the regions were sorted based on the chromosome and the start position. Duplicated regions were removed. The BEDtools (2.22.0) intersect command (<a href=\"#bib37\">Quinlan, 2014</a>) was used to determine the intersection between the regions in each group and the NOVA-CLIP-seq tags. The number of intersecting regions between a group and the NOVA binding sites were tallied. For each group, the number and the percentage of regions with and without NOVA binding sites were calculated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Thus, NOVA CLIP-tags intersecting with the following groups were examined: (1) statistically significant differentially spliced exons plus 500\u00a0bp of flanking sequence both upstream and downstream; (2) non-alternatively spliced exons plus 500\u00a0bp of flanking sequence both upstream and downstream; (3) random genomic sequences of similar fragment size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

They observe obesity-induced changes in programs of adipocyte gene expression and alternative splicing associated with multiple signalling pathways that are known to regulate adipose tissue biology. They link changes in alternative splicing to Nova splicing regulators through an analysis of motif enrichment, published CLIP-Seq data, and the surprising observation that Nova proteins are expressed in adipocytes. The authors also provide evidence that Nova deficiency in adipocytes results in increased adipose tissue thermogenesis and improved glycemia. Collectively, the authors' study represents an important advance in understanding the role of alternative splicing in metabolic regulation and its contribution to the development of diet-induced obesity. The authors are requested to address the following points in a revised manuscript."

However, the \u0394PSI cut-off used is &gt;1%. In most studies employing RNA-Seq analysis to analyze splicing changes, \u0394PSI cut-offs applied are typically &gt;10%, in large part because smaller \u0394PSI values are unreliable (they are within the noise range of the detection) and unlikely biologically significant. This raises some concern about the CLIP-Seq analysis in which ~42% of the HFD induced AS events are claimed to have NOVA CLIP-Seq tags (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). What was the \u0394PSI cut-off used for this analysis? Do the authors observe similar results (NOVA motif and GO term enrichment etc.) when a more stringent \u0394PSI is applied? In general, RNA-Seq measurements of alternative splicing should be validated by performing RT-PCR assays on a representative subset of the detected changes (see also comment 6 below)."

Keeping in mind point 3 above, it would be informative to know whether enriched YCAY motifs supported by CLIP-Seq data form distributions that are predictive of increased versus decreased exon inclusion (as per the binding maps published by Darnell and colleagues), when Nova is expressed in versus depleted from adipocytes."

A comparison of <i>Jnk1/2</i> isoform ratios in two different tissues after normalizations further convolutes the results. Also, it is recommended that the authors use a different approach to quantify <i>Jnk1/2</i> splice isoform ratios as qPCR assays can give inaccurate results due to different primer efficiencies between separate assays.

We believe that this study, which is beyond the scope of the present analysis, will provide a definitive complementation test for the role of JNK.
