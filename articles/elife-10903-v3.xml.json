Here, we show that P1-HNF4\u03b1 is expressed primarily in the differentiated compartment of the mouse colonic crypt and P2-HNF4\u03b1 in the proliferative compartment. Exon swap mice that express only P1- or only P2-HNF4\u03b1 have different colonic gene expression profiles, interacting proteins, cellular migration, ion transport and epithelial barrier function. The mice also exhibit altered susceptibilities to experimental colitis (DSS) and colitis-associated colon cancer (AOM+DSS). When P2-HNF4\u03b1-only mice (which have elevated levels of the cytokine resistin-like \u03b2, RELM\u03b2, and are extremely sensitive to DSS) are crossed with <i>Retnlb</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, they are rescued from mortality. Furthermore, P2-HNF4\u03b1 binds and preferentially activates the RELM\u03b2 promoter. In summary, HNF4\u03b1 isoforms perform non-redundant functions in the colon under conditions of stress, underscoring the importance of tracking them both in colitis and colon cancer."

Here, we show that P1-HNF4\u03b1 is expressed primarily in the differentiated compartment of the mouse colonic crypt and P2-HNF4\u03b1 in the proliferative compartment. Exon swap mice that express only P1- or only P2-HNF4\u03b1 have different colonic gene expression profiles, interacting proteins, cellular migration, ion transport and epithelial barrier function. The mice also exhibit altered susceptibilities to experimental colitis (DSS) and colitis-associated colon cancer (AOM+DSS). When P2-HNF4\u03b1-only mice (which have elevated levels of the cytokine resistin-like \u03b2, RELM\u03b2, and are extremely sensitive to DSS) are crossed with <i>Retnlb</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, they are rescued from mortality. Furthermore, P2-HNF4\u03b1 binds and preferentially activates the RELM\u03b2 promoter. In summary, HNF4\u03b1 isoforms perform non-redundant functions in the colon under conditions of stress, underscoring the importance of tracking them both in colitis and colon cancer."

There are two different promoters (proximal P1 and distal P2) in the HNF4\u03b1 gene that are both active in the colon. The promoters are conserved from frog to human and, along with alternative splicing, give rise to nine different transcript variants of HNF4\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Huang et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The major isoforms of the P1 promoter are HNF4\u03b11/\u03b12 while the P2 promoter gives rise to HNF4\u03b17/\u03b18: distinct first exons result in an altered A/B domain which harbors the activation function 1 (AF-1) while the DNA and ligand binding domains are identical. The two promoters are expressed under unique temporal and spatial conditions, with the large and small intestine being the only adult tissues that express both P1- and P2-HNF4\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tanaka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Nakhei et al., 1998</a>). While a loss of P1- but not P2-HNF4\u03b1 has been noted in colon cancer (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chellappa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tanaka et al., 2006</a>), the specific roles of the HNF4\u03b1 isoforms remain obscure. For example, P1-driven HNF4\u03b1 acts as a tumor suppressor in mouse liver (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hatziapostolou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Walesky et al., 2013a</a>). In contrast, the <i>HNF4A</i> gene and protein are amplified in human colon cancer (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>) although the different isoforms were not distinguished in those studies. We recently showed that ectopic expression of P1- but not P2-HNF4\u03b1 decreased the tumorigenic potential of the human colon cancer cell line HCT116 in a mouse xenograft model (<a href=\"#bib71\">Vuong et al., 2015</a>), suggesting that the different HNF4\u03b1 isoforms may indeed play distinct roles in the colon."

We show that in wildtype (WT) mice P1- and P2-HNF4\u03b1 are expressed in different compartments in the colonic epithelium, interact with distinct sets of proteins, regulate the expression of unique sets of target genes, and play distinct roles during pathological conditions such as colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). We also provide genetic and biochemical evidence indicating that RELM\u03b2, a member of the RELM/FIZZ family of cytokines, plays a critical role in the response of HNF4\u03b1 to colitis and appears to be both directly\u00a0and indirectly regulated by HNF4\u03b1."

Therefore, to elucidate the mechanism responsible for differential gene expression in mouse colon, we performed RIME (Rapid Immunoprecipitation Mass spectrometry of Endogenous proteins) on HNF4\u03b1 in the colons of \u03b11HMZ and \u03b17HMZ mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The isoforms share 76 interacting proteins, including previously reported HNF4\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Daigo et al., 2011</a>), a well known co-regulator for nuclear receptors (NRIP1, RIP140) and DPF2, a BRG1-associated factor (BAF45). However, there were more proteins uniquely binding HNF4\u03b1 in \u03b17HMZ and \u03b11HMZ colons -- 138 and 99, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> top and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5C\u2014source data 2A\u2013E</a>). Src tyrosine kinase, for example, bound uniquely in \u03b11HMZ colons, consistent with our previous report that Src preferentially phosphorylates and interacts with HNF4\u03b11 in cell-based and in vitro systems\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Chellappa et al., 2012</a>) and validating RIME for identification of differential interacting proteins in vivo. In contrast, CUL4A, a core component of a cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and overexpressed in cancer (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kopanja et al., 2009</a>), and PCM1, a centrosome binding protein translocated to the JAK2 locus in certain leukemias (<a href=\"#bib60\">Reiter et al., 2005</a>), both bound uniquely in \u03b17HMZ colons. Both CUL4A and PCM1 are required for efficient cell proliferation, genome stability and/or proper centrosome function (<a href=\"#bib26\">Erger and Casale, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Farina et al., 2016</a>), consistent with the upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle and DNA repair in \u03b17HMZ colons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), and accelerated tumorigenesis in \u03b17HMZ mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

For example, NDRG2, a kinase downstream of the mTOR/SGK pathway and a tumor suppressor that mediates apoptosis\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Deuschle et al., 2012</a>), and\u00a0EMD, a nuclear membrane protein phosphorylated by\u00a0Src (<a href=\"#bib70\">Tifft et al., 2009</a>), both preferentially bind HNF4\u03b11 and have been negatively associated with colon cancer. Likewise, HNF4\u03b11 was preferentially bound by catalytic subunits of AMPK (PRKAA1/2) and is known to be phosphorylated by AMPK, which decreases its protein stability (<a href=\"#bib40\">Hong et al., 2003</a>). However,\u00a0AMPK suppresses cell proliferation via inhibition of mTOR and activation of p53 pathways (<a href=\"#bib52\">Motoshima et al., 2006</a>) and low levels of AMPK activity are correlated with poor survival in metastatic colon cancer patients (<a href=\"#bib77\">Zulato et al., 2014</a>), indicating that additional studies are required to elucidate the impact of AMPK signaling on HNF4\u03b1 in colitis and colon cancer. In contrast, protein kinase C beta 2 (PRKCB) preferentially interacts with HNF4\u03b17 and is known to be both necessary and sufficient to confer susceptibility to AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis in the colonic epithelium (<a href=\"#bib45\">Liu, 2004</a>). All told, there were hundreds of proteins that preferentially interacted with the HNF4\u03b1 isoforms, including many signaling molecules as well as RNA binding proteins and transcription factors, providing multiple potential mechanisms for differential gene expression."

However, the \u03b17HMZ distal colon was refractory to stimulation with calcium-dependent (carbachol) and cAMP-dependent chloride secretagogues (forskolin), while the \u03b11HMZ distal colon showed a markedly increased Isc response to forskolin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Since impaired chloride secretion is observed in colitis (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hirota and McKay, 2009</a>), this differential response to forskolin as well as cell migration could explain, at least in part, the differential sensitivity of the \u03b11HMZ and \u03b17HMZ mice to DSS."

In contrast, the weight loss of the RbKO/\u03b17HMZ mice was completely restored to WT/WT levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), as was the colon length (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) and overall survival (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Notably, the RELM\u03b2 protein levels in the \u03b11HMZ mice were significantly reduced at three days of recovery (although elevated right at the end of the DSS treatment) and inversely correlated with colon length (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). These results suggest that elevated RELM\u03b2 expression in untreated and DSS-treated \u03b17HMZ mice and decreased expression during recovery in \u03b11HMZ mice might contribute to their increased and decreased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis, respectively. Interestingly, body weight loss is attenuated in \u03b11HMZ during DSS treatment, however this protective effect is lost during recovery (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

Here, we examined the HNF4\u03b1 gene, which has two highly conserved promoters (P1 and P2) that give rise to proteins with different N-termini (P1-HNF4\u03b1 and P2-HNF4\u03b1).

We show that in untreated WT adult mice P1-HNF4\u03b1 protein is expressed in the differentiated compartment and the surface of the colonic epithelium whereas P2-HNF4\u03b1 expression is restricted to the proliferative and differentiated compartments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Transgenic mice expressing just a single isoform of HNF4\u03b1 developed morphologically normal intestines, but hundreds of genes in the colon were differentially expressed compared to WT mice, many of which are consistent with altered barrier function and localization of the isoforms: mice expressing only P1-HNF4\u03b1 (\u03b11HMZ) had an upregulation of genes involved in differentiation, while mice expressing only P2-HNF4\u03b1 (\u03b17HMZ) had higher levels of DNA repair and cell cycle genes. Furthermore, we found that HNF4\u03b1 isoforms interact in vivo with unique sets of proteins, especially those involved in signal transduction, which could contribute to differential gene expression patterns and thereby result in different susceptibilities to colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer in the isoform-specific mice. Finally, we show that <i>Retnlb</i>, which encodes the cytokine RELM\u03b2, a key player in DSS-induced colitis, is a downstream target of P2-HNF4\u03b1."

Since the chloride secretory pathway is required for maintaining proper luminal hydration, which helps protect the epithelium from physical damage (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barrett and Keely, 2000</a>), this suggests that the isoform-specific mice have different barrier functions, which we confirmed with FITC-dextran assays. Decreased expression of cell adhesion genes in \u03b17HMZ colons -- such as E-cadherin (<i>Cdh1</i>), an established HNF4\u03b1 target (<a href=\"#bib7\">Battle et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Elbediwy et al., 2012</a>) critical for both migration of cells along crypt-villi axis and epithelial barrier function (<a href=\"#bib31\">Grill et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Schneider et al., 2010</a>) -- would contribute to decreased barrier function. In contrast, downstream effectors of IL-18 signaling (<i>Il18r1</i> and <i>Il18rap)</i>, which are implicated in intestinal epithelial barrier function (<a href=\"#bib55\">Nowarski et al., 2015</a>), were increased in \u03b17HMZ mice, while <i>Il18bp</i>, a decoy receptor for IL-18 which attenuates signaling, is decreased. All told, there are several key cell adhesion and cytokine signaling genes that are dysregulated in \u03b17HMZ colons that could contribute to decreased barrier function and subsequently a pro-inflammatory state (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hogan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">McVay et al., 2006</a>), which could in turn contribute to the enhanced colitis and tumorigenesis observed in \u03b17HMZ mice. One such cytokine is RELM\u03b2, which we show is a direct target of HNF4\u03b1 and preferentially activated by P2-HNF4\u03b1."

Hence, the inability of \u03b17HMZ mice to effectively recover from DSS could be attributed to defective migration, chloride secretion (ion transport) and/or differentiation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). BrdU-labeled cells exhibited greater migration in \u03b11HMZ and lower migration in \u03b17HMZ mice: \u03b17HMZ mice also had reduced expression of genes involved in cell motility. <i>Cldn15</i> is downregulated in \u03b17HMZ and upregulated in \u03b11HMZ colons and a known target of HNF4\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Darsigny et al., 2009</a>). <i>Cldn15</i> dysregulation could explain the decrease in secretory capacity in \u03b17HMZ mice and hence their inability to recover after DSS as a basal level of secretion is important for proper gut formation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson and Van Itallie, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tamura et al., 2008</a>). <i>Cdx2</i>, another established target of HNF4\u03b1\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib62\">Saandi et al., 2013</a>) and a major player in intestinal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Suh and Traber, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lorentz et al., 1997</a>), has a similar expression profile. Finally, the involvement of these processes in recovery from DSS could explain why the crypt structure in the \u03b17HMZ mice is not completely ameliorated by the RELM\u03b2 knockout even though body weight and colon length loss and lethality are: it has been noted previously that RELM\u03b2 expression per se does not alter colonic epithelial proliferation <a href=\"#bib49\">McVay et al., 2006</a> and\u00a0its role in affecting the barrier function is still debated (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hogan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">McVay et al., 2006</a>)."

Those roles seem to be driven by unique interacting partners leading to differential expression of target genes. The results also show that any\u00a0factor that disrupts the balance between the HNF4\u03b1 isoforms in the colon could have serious functional consequences. Those factors include Src tyrosine kinase (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chellappa et al., 2012</a>), as well as any one of a number of other signaling molecules that interact preferentially with the isoforms. Future studies will be required to elucidate all the underlying mechanisms but it is anticipated that several will be important in diagnosing and treating gastrointestinal diseases involving HNF4\u03b1."

RNA was pooled from two to three mice per genotype and applied to one array; a second array was processed in a similar fashion for a total of four to six mice assayed per genotype. Results from the two arrays were averaged. Isoform-specific mice were compared to their appropriate, age-matched WT controls.

However, though nicely demonstrated, the conclusion that the P1 form is tumor suppressing and the P2 form is oncogenic is insufficient for publication in <i>eLife</i>. What is missing is a mechanistic connection between the 2 isoforms and expression of RELM\u03b2. Thus, publication in <i>eLife</i> requires making such a mechanistic connection, particularly showing that the P2 isoform, but not the P1 isoform, activates the RELM\u03b2 promoter through HNF4\u03b1 sites. There are several possible options (reporter assays, ChIP, mutation of the site) that could be completed in the standard 2-month period (or slightly longer) since they are standard experiments. Ideally, it would be nice to show that P2-mediated regulation of RELM\u03b2 per se is critical in mice as mentioned by Reviewer 1, but this is likely to take too long and is not required. For your information, the full reviews are included below."

There is already a considerable body of evidence indicating that the HNF4\u03b1 isoforms are differentially regulated and have different functions. In particular, there is considerable evidence that the P1 form acts as a tumor suppressor. Also, over-expression of HNF4\u03b1 is oncogenic despite the P1 form, suggesting that P2 acts as an oncogene. The authors nicely test this by generating mice that can only express either the P1 or P2 isoforms and assessing various phenotypes including gene expression profiles and colitis susceptibilities, the authors significantly improve the understanding of the distinct roles of these isoforms. To this non-expert, the experiments generally seem fine with clear results. However, the differences between the isoforms are phenomenological with limited mechanistic understanding, and their opposing roles in colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer are in accord with previous characterization as tumor suppressing and tumor promoting. As such, I think this paper will be of interest to specialists in HNF4\u03b1 and colitis/colon cancer, but it is unclear what findings are of more general significance."

Moreover, the conclusion that P2-mediated up-regulation of RELM\u03b2 is important is not really tested. The correct experiment would be to knock out HNF4 sites that are required for the up-regulation of RELM\u03b2 and show that this blocks colitis. Alternatively, some other manipulation that reduces RELM\u03b2 levels to the uninduced level. To put it differently, one has to show that the regulation of RELM\u03b2 is important, not just the gene itself which is already known. I realize this is a fair amount of work."

Expression of the P2 promoter isoform only results in increased sensitivity to DSS and increased tumorigenesis in an AOX/DSS model, while opposite results are observed with mice that express only the P1 isoforms. Within the context of nuclear receptor function, it is well known that there are multiple isoforms of many NRs, but they are generally not distinguished functionally. Thus, this represents a particularly clear example of delineation of distinct functions of different isoforms. This observation might be of more limited interest, but clear mechanistic information is provided by the demonstration that RELM\u03b2 is overexpressed in the DSS sensitive P2-specific mice, and that doubly mutant P2 specific/RELM\u03b2 knockout mice are resistant to the increased sensitivity to DSS."

However, the relevant question is how significant the advance is over previous work, particularly at the \"general interest\" level needed for publication in <i>eLife</i>. From my outside perspective, there is already evidence (perhaps considerable was too strong) that P1 acts as a tumor suppressor and that P2 acts an oncogene (less explicitly demonstrated, but the only reasonable way to explain how overproduction of HNF4\u03b1 is oncogenic). The authors experiments are a nice and more explicit demonstration of the opposing roles of the P1 vs P2 forms, but I do not view this is as a major advance. Yes, the experimental systems are different and the experiments better, but the basic point is the same. For this reason, I (and the other Reviewer) thought that the basic opposing phenotypes were worth publishing, but not a sufficient advance for <i>eLife</i>."

Of course, the primary finding (point 1) means that mice expressing these different isoforms have very different phenotypes and hence very different transcriptional profiles. Ultimately, this means that the different isoforms have different transcriptional effects, but profiling data per se provides no mechanistic information. Conversely, the previous knowledge that RELM\u03b2 is linked to colitis combined with the authors' finding that RELM\u03b2 levels are increased in P2 mice does not indicate that this up-regulation is functionally important. It is entirely possible that a RELM\u03b2 derivative expressed at its normal level but unable to be induced by P2 would behave similarly to the wt (inducible) allele. To put it differently, one predicts that increased DSS sensitivity would depend on RELM\u03b2 no matter how once increased DSS sensitivity is achieved. So, again, there is no specific link between P2-overexpression and the RELM\u03b2 requirement for DSS sensitivity."

However, this does not really address the critical point, namely the differential behavior of the isoforms. Also, the focus on DNA-binding is possibly misplaced, as it is entirely possible that the distinction between the isoforms relates to transcriptional potential or interaction with other proteins (with differential transcriptional potential). I agree that artificial reporters with HNF4\u03b1 sites is likely to be useless. But, what I imagined was an experiment with a reporter driven by a reasonably large segment of the RELM\u03b2 locus and co-transfection of the individual isoforms."

The effects on barrier function and/or RELM\u03b2 could be very indirect consequences of the distinct HNF4\u03b1 isoforms. By definition, the phenotypic differences caused by the distinct isoforms means that, at some level any property (molecular or overall phenotype) is differentially affected. In addition, the relationship of the P2 mice vs. other versions of DSS-induced colitis means that there are mechanistic similarities between those situations, but they don't address be basis of why P1 vs. P2 are different."

Thus, publication in eLife requires making such a mechanistic connection, particularly showing that the P2 isoform, but not the P1 isoform, activates the RELM\u03b2 promoter through HNF4\u03b1 sites. There are several possible options (reporter assays, ChIP, mutation of the site) that could be completed in the standard 2-month period (or slightly longer) since they are standard experiments.

One, we did not detect any HNF4\u03b1 ChIPseq peaks (or RNAseq signal) in the RELM\u03b2 promoter in the HCT116 cell line expressing either HNF4\u03b12 (P1 isoform) or HNF4\u03b18 (P2 isoform) (PMID: 26240283). Two, Verzi\u2019s group did not detect ChIPseq peaks for HNF4\u03b1 in the CaCo2 cell line (PMID: 21074721). However, these negative results could be due either to the cell type (HCT116 cells do not express endogenous HNF4\u03b1 and are considered to be stem cell like while Caco2 cells are a cancer cell line, albeit of an epithelial cell origin and they express endogenousl HNF4\u03b1) and/or technical issues (especially in terms of the Caco2 cells since we did not perform those experiments). The other possibility is that, in addition to HNF4\u03b1, other factors are needed to activate the expression of the RELM\u03b2 gene, such as CDX2, NFkB and STAT pathways, which are activated in response to bacteria (PMID:15576623).

Therefore, RELM\u03b2 expression and activation in the \u03b17HMZ mice could be influenced by altered epithelial barrier function.

We co-transfected HNF4\u03b1 isoforms in LS174T cell line with RELM\u03b2 reporter constructs and we found that P2-HNF4\u03b1 activates RELM\u03b2 promoter significantly better than P1-HNF4\u03b1 (new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>)."

These experiments show that both HNF4\u03b1 isoforms regulate RELM\u03b2 promoter but P2-HNF4\u03b1 is stronger transactivator than P1-HNF4\u03b1. On the other hand P2-HNF4\u03b1 does not activate ApoB promoter well compared to P1-HNF4\u03b1 (new <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7 \u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), indicating that there are promoter-specific effects of the HNF4\u03b1 isoforms, consistent with the gene expression arrays.

Again, the P1 vs. P2 cells have many differences, but those differences per se don't address any mechanistic understanding. The effects on barrier function and/or RELM\u03b2 could be very indirect consequences of the distinct HNF4\u03b1 isoforms. By definition, the phenotypic differences caused by the distinct isoforms means that, at some level any property (molecular or overall phenotype) is differentially affected. In addition, the relationship of the P2 mice vs. other versions of DSS-induced colitis means that there are mechanistic similarities between those situations, but they don't address be basis of why P1 vs. P2 are different.</i>"

Any one of these differentially interacting proteins could have an impact on HNF4\u03b1 transactivation. For example, we found that Src tyrosine kinase specifically interacts with P1-HNF4\u03b1 but not P2-HNF4\u03b1 in mouse colon. This finding validates our approach as it is consistent with our 2012 PNAS work in which we show that in cell-based assays Src specifically phosphorylates P1-HNF4\u03b1 and causes a decrease in protein stability as well as nuclear localization and transactivation potential. In this single experiment in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> we now add to the Src story more than a dozen other kinases, phosphatases and other proteins that could impact HNF4\u03b1 transactivation."
