The contribution of these cells to information encoding is under current investigation. Here, we show that incoming spike trains activate different populations of GC determined by the stimulation frequency and GC age. Immature GC respond to a wider range of stimulus frequencies, whereas mature GC are less responsive at high frequencies. This difference is dictated by feedforward inhibition, which restricts mature GC activation. Yet, the stronger inhibition of mature GC results in a higher temporal fidelity compared to that of immature GC. Thus, hippocampal inputs activate two populations of neurons with variable frequency filters: immature cells, with wide\u2010range responses, that are reliable transmitters of the incoming frequency, and mature neurons, with narrow frequency response, that are precise at informing the beginning of the stimulus, but with a sparse activity."

The contribution of these cells to information encoding is under current investigation. Here, we show that incoming spike trains activate different populations of GC determined by the stimulation frequency and GC age. Immature GC respond to a wider range of stimulus frequencies, whereas mature GC are less responsive at high frequencies. This difference is dictated by feedforward inhibition, which restricts mature GC activation. Yet, the stronger inhibition of mature GC results in a higher temporal fidelity compared to that of immature GC. Thus, hippocampal inputs activate two populations of neurons with variable frequency filters: immature cells, with wide\u2010range responses, that are reliable transmitters of the incoming frequency, and mature neurons, with narrow frequency response, that are precise at informing the beginning of the stimulus, but with a sparse activity."

Activity arriving to the hippocampus from the entorhinal cortex (EC) should be processed by heterogeneous populations of granule cells (GC) of different stages of maturation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lepousez et al., 2015</a>). Neural progenitor cells of the adult subgranular zone give rise to dentate GC that develop and mature over several weeks. Developing GC follow a precise sequence to establish their afferent connectivity and functional maturation. New born neurons are initially contacted by dendritic GABAergic terminals, followed by glutamatergic axons and last by GABAergic perisomatic contacts. In parallel, their membrane resistance decreases and excitability becomes mature (<a href=\"#bib11\">Esp\u00f3sito et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ge et al., 2006</a>). When fully developed, adult-born neurons achieve a functional profile that is indistinguishable from that of all other GC as reflected by their inputs, intrinsic membrane properties, and firing behavior (<a href=\"#bib26\">Laplagne et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2007</a>). In addition, adult-born GC form functional glutamatergic synapses onto DG interneurons and CA3 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Toni et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Temprana et al., 2015</a>), indicating that new neurons receive, process, and convey information onto target neurons and participate in hippocampal function."

The interaction of the excitatory activity arriving from EC with the recruited inhibition will ultimately determine GC's activity. Inhibitory circuits can have a profound impact in the processing of afferent activity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Markwardt et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ikrar et al., 2013</a>); for example, they can ensure a temporal fidelity of responses (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pouille and Scanziani, 2001</a>) and also modulate neuronal firing in response to afferent inputs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pouille et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Dieni et al., 2013</a>). We have previously demonstrated that due to a smaller and slower inhibition, immature GC are preferentially recruited in response to a single stimulation of its afferent entorhinal pathway (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mar\u00edn-Burgin et al., 2012</a>). However, activity arriving to the hippocampus does not only come as a single stimulus but varies during different brain states in frequencies ranging from theta to gamma (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Draguhn, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Moser, 2013</a>). How is this information transformed into activity of the granule cells? Are immature and mature populations of neurons differentially recruited at different frequencies? If that was the case, information arriving to DG could be differentially channeled into activation of different populations of granule cells depending on the frequency."

We found that due to a weaker influence of feedforward inhibitory circuits, immature neurons can respond to a wider range of frequencies than mature neurons, however, they are less time locked to the incoming stimuli. Mature neurons on the contrary show a higher temporal fidelity but are less effective in their responses to frequency. We suggest that immature and mature GC reflect complementary aspects of incoming activity."

Activation of mature and immature GC decreased within each train, and this reduction was more pronounced for the higher frequencies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To quantitatively compare activation between mature and immature GC across frequencies, we calculated the average spike number for all 10 pulses for each frequency. Results indicate that the activation of GC decreases drastically with frequency. However, immature GC spiked more reliably than mature GC at all frequencies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Stimulation at 1 Hz represents a situation similar to applying a single pulse; accordingly, spiking probability in matGC was around 50% (5 spikes average), consistent with the responses evoked using stimulation intensities of about 50% of the fEPSP and with previous results (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mar\u00edn-Burgin et al., 2012</a>). While 4wpiGC significantly responded with more than 1 spike to all frequencies, matGC only responded with more than 1 spike to 1 and 10 Hz, indicating that matGC could not be synaptically activated to fire at 20 and 40 Hz (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Furthermore, matGC could not spike two consecutive action potentials even if the stimulation intensity was chosen to record neurons above threshold (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The higher activation levels of 4wpiGC at all frequencies indicate that they could reproduce a wider range of frequencies than matGC.

At 20 and 40 Hz however, when the separation of stimuli is 50 ms or less, the recruitment of inhibitory circuits does restrict the response of immature neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These results are extremely interesting because they indicate that there is a different temporal window in which inhibition restricts mature and immature GC activation. Immature neurons have a wider time window during which excitation can elicit spikes without being affected by inhibition. The differential effect of inhibition on immature and mature GC explains the wider range of responses of immature GC to stimuli arriving at frequencies ranging from 1 to 40 Hz, as compared to mature neurons which rarely reproduce high frequencies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), demonstrating that each population have different gains to filter frequency. In addition, the results reveal that inhibitory circuits generate a wide variability of responses in the population of GC, since not only are they responsible for the differences in activation between 4wpiGC and matGC, but also for the frequency dependence of the activation."

Thus, we obtained a single value of the EPSG and a single value of the IPSG, for 4wpiGC and matGC at each frequency. These data show that the evoked inhibition in both populations of GC increases with frequency. Excitation, on the contrary, slightly decreases (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This slight decrease in the total excitation with the frequency explains the slight decrease in the activation of GC when inhibition was blocked (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). On the other hand, the large increase in inhibition with frequency, explains the large differences found in the activation of GC among frequencies in the conditions in which the circuit was intact (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Notably, inhibition particularly increases at 20 Hz and 40 Hz, and this coincides with the greatest decrease in the activation of GC. Both excitatory and inhibitory conductances are smaller in 4wpiGC than in matGC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), which reflects that these connections are not fully mature at this developmental stage, as previously shown (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mar\u00edn-Burgin et al., 2012</a>). Nonetheless, differences in inhibition between immature and mature neurons are greater than in excitation, giving higher mean excitation/inhibition ratios in 4wpiGC than matGC at 1 and 10 Hz (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). At 20 Hz and 40 Hz higher ratios are only observed within the first pulses of the train, where spiking differences reside (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, higher excitation/inhibition ratios in 4wpiGC explain their higher levels of activation after train stimulation. On the other hand, in the absence of inhibition both 4wpiGC and mature GC display similar firing properties. This similarity results from the balance between a strong excitatory drive combined with a low input resistance in mature GC, and a weak excitation matched to high resistance in 4wpiGC. The latter combination facilitates reaching spiking threshold with small postsynaptic currents (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mongiat et al., 2009</a>)."

To better understand the extent to which this difference affects activation as a function of frequency, we calculated the residual inhibition at different periods corresponding to the studied frequencies, and added the recruited inhibition observed on average at 1 Hz on top (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The results clearly show that due to the faster kinetics of the IPSC in matGC, the contribution of the recruited inhibition in matGC is higher than in 4wpiGC. Therefore, the sum of residual plus recruited inhibition in matGC is higher than excitation even if stimuli are 100 ms apart (restricting their responses to 10 Hz stimulation), whereas 4wpiGC have a wider temporal window in which inhibition does not overcome excitation (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Therefore, we focused on the understanding of which components of the activated inhibitory circuit are responsible for the observed differences. As we have mentioned, activation of mPP not only produces excitation on GC but also activates inhibitory circuits in a feedforward manner. In addition, activation of GC could also recruit feedback inhibition that could influence their activity, especially during trains of stimuli. The contribution of each type of inhibition could vary depending on the train frequency. To study the specific contribution of feedforward and feedback inhibition to the total inhibition recruited with trains of stimulation, whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments were performed in 4wpiGC and matGC, and trains were applied to the mPP at different frequencies. EPSC and IPSC were recorded in control conditions and in the presence of DCG4, an agonist of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR<sub>2/3</sub>) that reduces release probability in mossy fiber terminals (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kamiya et al., 1996</a>). Application of DCG4 abolished feedback inhibition, and the remaining inhibition corresponded then to feedforward inhibition (IPSC-FF). The contribution of feedback inhibition (IPSC-FB) was then calculated by subtraction of the IPSC-FF to total IPSC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Immature neurons, on the contrary, show longer latencies (most cells spike after the pop spike) and broader distribution of latencies to spike than mature neurons. In addition, 4wpiGC also show a higher variance of their spike times than mature neurons. The little jitter of matGC indicates that this population of neurons has a higher temporal fidelity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In the absence of inhibition, both populations increased their spike time variability, indicating that inhibition restricts their temporal responses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Even in the absence of inhibition mature neurons show more precise activation which could be given by the nature of the excitatory input, which is stronger in mature GC than in immature GC. On the other hand, immature neurons have slower membrane time constant (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mongiat et al., 2009</a>) that could also contribute to their higher spiking jitter. These results suggest a division of labor in the populations of immature and mature GC, in which immature neurons respond with higher efficacy to the frequency of the afferent inputs but with imprecise responses to the timing of the afferent spike, while mature neurons respond with a narrow tuning to the time of the afferent inputs, though with less efficiency to respond to frequency."

The results also demonstrate that the activation differences between immature and mature GC are governed by the recruitment of feedforward inhibitory circuits. The small and slow inhibition, that allows immature neurons to be good transmitters of frequency, together with the weak excitation they receive, generates a worse temporal fidelity in those cells compared to mature neurons, that are time locked to the stimulus. Thus, activity arriving to the hippocampus at different frequencies could be reflected by the activation of graded populations of neurons, immature GC that are reliable transmitters of the incoming frequency, and mature GC that are precise at informing the beginning of the stimulus, but with sparse activity."

Extracellular field potentials recorded in vivo present oscillations that change with different brain states (<a href=\"#bib46\">Womelsdorf et al., 2014</a>). For example, layer II of the EC and the DG of the hippocampus, tend to oscillate in frequencies theta (\u223c7 Hz) and gamma (\u223c40 Hz) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Roux and Buzsaki, 2015</a>). Neurons from EC, the main afferents to DG, are activated by brief bursts of frequencies in the gamma order spaced by intervals in the order of theta frequency (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chrobak and Buzsaki, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fyhn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bonnevie et al., 2013</a>). Our results indicate that differences in the activation frequency of afferent MEC inputs arriving to DG differentially activate immature and mature GC. Although both populations of neurons tend to behave as low pass filters, immature neurons are more efficient in responding to trains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In fact, immature neurons would be able to spike with more than two spikes in a theta cycle, whereas mature neurons would not. The implications of this result are important also in terms of the effect that GC could have in CA3. It has been shown that direct stimulation of one GC is capable of activating a pyramidal cell in CA3; however, one action potential is not enough to cause activation of the pyramidal cell, but it requires at least two, and the activation probability increases exponentially with the frequency of GC stimulation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Henze et al., 2002</a>). Because the connectivity of 4wpiGC in CA3 is very similar to the connectivity of matGC (<a href=\"#bib43\">Temprana et al., 2015</a>), our results suggest that immature GC could be more efficient in transmitting high frequency stimuli which can cause a robust activation of CA3 pyramidal cells. A higher probability of efferent activation by immature GC may have a role to reinforce these connections, since 4wpiGC also have greater levels of LTP in these synapses (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gu et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that perhaps immature neurons could select networks in CA3 that correspond to a particular moment in which those GC are still immature."

Therefore, the slow feedforward inhibition observed in immature neurons is essential to determine differences in activation between them and mature neurons. The time interval between trains of pulses at 1 and 10 Hz stimulation is such that the delayed IPSC in 4wpiGC does not compensate the EPSC, and thus inhibition at these frequencies does not affect the activation of immature cells. This could have important functional consequences in light of studies suggesting that activation of DG is set to frequencies near theta (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jung and McNaughton, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Leutgeb et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012</a>).

A recently published study in mature GC shows that dendritic inhibition is preferentially recruited with high frequency stimulation and grows along the train of pulses. Instead perisomatic inhibition is recruited at low and high frequencies, and decreases within a train (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). In the same line, we have previously shown that dendritic inhibition is very similar between mature and immature neurons, but perisomatic inhibition is bigger and faster in mature GC (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mar\u00edn-Burgin et al., 2012</a>). In light of these results and since we have found that the main difference between mature and immature GC resides in feedforward inhibition, it is highly possible that feedforward inhibition has an important perisomatic component, like the one PV interneurons exert. The slow inhibition on 4wpiGC could be a consequence of the immature nature of perisomatic inhibitory contacts from PV interneurons, which would require future investigation. Also, there could be a differential contribution of mossy cells, which can affect inhibition and excitation on GC (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chancey et al., 2014</a>)."

And a <i>dense code</i>, in which most neurons are active at any moment and information is encoded by variations in firing rate. Our results suggest that mature and immature GC could represent these two different codes coexisting in the same structure and presumably serving at different functions.

Thus, for a given input strength within a slice, the number of mPP axons stimulated in control conditions or in the presence of PTX (100 \u00b5M, Sigma-Aldrich) were the same."

To minimize the contribution of IPSCs mediated by direct stimulation of inhibitory axons, we only considered experiments in which kynurenic acid (KYN) (6 mM, bath applied at the end of the experiment) blocked &gt;70% of IPSCs. EPSCs were isolated by voltage clamping GC at the reversal potential of the IPSC measured for each individual neuron (\u223c60 mV). In turn, disynaptic IPSCs were recorded at the reversal potential of the EPSC (\u223c0 mV). When present, direct monosynaptic IPSC recorded in KYN (always &lt;30% of the peak IPSC amplitude) was subtracted from the IPSC. Synaptic excitatory and inhibitory conductances were computed as the EPSC or IPSC divided by the driving force at which the synaptic currents were recorded. 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5, 50 mM, Tocris, United Kingdom) was perfused during recordings to block NMDA currents. We ruled out a possible influence of NMDA receptor-mediated currents on the activation of GC by recording spiking in the presence of AP5. No differences were found between spiking in ACSF and after application of AP5 in the bath (data not shown)."

In this condition, the remaining feedforward current was measured, and the feedback component was calculated by subtracting the feedforward current to the total current offline. In parallel experiments, we controlled for the effect of DCG4 on the activation of inhibitory interneurons, by measuring the change in their activation in response to mPP stimulation after the application of DCG4, using a stimulation intensity of 50% fEPSP as in the rest of the work (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Thus, their responsiveness to input frequency should be different. Indeed, young GCs have been demonstrated to be more responsive/excitable than mature ones due to lower activation threshold by the authors in Marin-Burgin, Science 2012. Please revise your statement or alternatively discuss the influence of intrinsic properties on the results."

Either there is interesting biology that renders immature GCs insensitive to inhibitory conductances, or there is a less interesting (and potentially misleading) possibility that the stimulus paradigm is insufficient to detect the functional consequence of the inhibitory conductance. Even the relatively small conductance shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> in 4wpi cells should provide some degree of inhibition at 1 and 10 Hz."

This procedure was apparently developed for CA1, where most cells can be driven to spike whereas in the DG this appears not to be the case (the authors suggest that only \u223c 50% of cells spike with inhibition intact). Results from this group's previous study (Supplementary Figure S2E Marin-Burgin; 2012) shows the non-linear relationship between stimulus intensity and % of spiking cells, so it is hard to understand how the pSpike (i.e., the % of spiking cells) provides a sensitive measure of the number of active perforant path fibers.
