Using a platform that combines exhaustive point-mutagenesis of peptide substrates, bacterial surface-display, cell sorting, and deep sequencing, we have defined the specificities of the first two kinases in this pathway, Lck and ZAP-70, for the T cell receptor \u03b6 chain and the scaffold proteins LAT and SLP-76. We find that ZAP-70 selects its substrates by utilizing an electrostatic mechanism that excludes substrates with positively-charged residues and favors LAT and SLP-76 phosphosites that are surrounded by negatively-charged residues. This mechanism prevents ZAP-70 from phosphorylating its own activation loop, thereby enforcing its strict dependence on Lck for activation. The sequence features in ZAP-70, LAT, and SLP-76 that underlie electrostatic selectivity likely contribute to the specific response of T cells to foreign antigens."

Using a platform that combines exhaustive point-mutagenesis of peptide substrates, bacterial surface-display, cell sorting, and deep sequencing, we have defined the specificities of the first two kinases in this pathway, Lck and ZAP-70, for the T cell receptor \u03b6 chain and the scaffold proteins LAT and SLP-76. We find that ZAP-70 selects its substrates by utilizing an electrostatic mechanism that excludes substrates with positively-charged residues and favors LAT and SLP-76 phosphosites that are surrounded by negatively-charged residues. This mechanism prevents ZAP-70 from phosphorylating its own activation loop, thereby enforcing its strict dependence on Lck for activation. The sequence features in ZAP-70, LAT, and SLP-76 that underlie electrostatic selectivity likely contribute to the specific response of T cells to foreign antigens."

ZAP-70 works together with another kinase called Lck to activate T cells, which enables the cells to mount an immune response when they encounter foreign molecules. This pathway is precisely controlled, with Lck activated first, followed by ZAP-70. Unlike most other tyrosine kinases, ZAP-70 cannot activate itself, and it will only phosphorylate a narrow range of substrates. The origin of these constraints are not understood, but they are thought to be crucial for ensuring that T cells readily respond to foreign molecules but not to healthy cells."

First, hundreds of different sequences based on natural substrates were genetically encoded and introduced into bacterial cells, with one type per bacterium. The bacteria displayed these sequence variants on their surface, and Shah et al. then treated the bacteria with either ZAP-70 or Lck. Cell sorting was used to isolate those bacterial cells with variants that were phosphorylated, and high-throughput DNA sequencing was used to identify the phosphorylated sequences. This approach revealed that ZAP-70 was deterred from phosphorylating sites that carry a positive charge and strongly preferred sites that are negatively-charged, such as those found in its two major substrates. Shah et al. also showed that Lck, which behaves like a typical tyrosine kinase, could not phosphorylate the substrates of ZAP-70 because of their substantial negative charge. This lack of cross-reactivity between Lck and the ZAP-70 substrates prevents premature signaling in T cells."

This region also deters the kinase from activating itself, making it dependent instead upon Lck for activation. Together, these results identify the distinctive features of ZAP-70 that are important for ensuring that T cells are activated only when they sense foreign molecules on unhealthy cells. The work will lead to future studies exploring the tightly controlled signaling events carried out by tyrosine kinases in T cells in more detail."

A notable feature of this pathway is a strict hierarchy in kinase activation, which is accompanied by highly specific phosphorylation of substrates by each kinase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). T cells must mount a strong and sustained response upon encountering a foreign peptide antigen bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule on an antigen-presenting cell, without launching an immune reaction against self-antigens. The origin of this selectivity is not well understood, and it cannot be explained by the modest differences in affinities between self and foreign peptide antigens for the T cell receptor (<a href=\"#bib61\">Palmer and Naeher, 2009</a>). The pattern of tyrosine kinase activity downstream of the T cell receptor is implicated in a kinetic proofreading mechanism that has been posited to underlie the fidelity of the T cell response (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chakraborty and Weiss, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">McKeithan, 1995</a>). In such a mechanism, complexes formed between the T cell receptor and antigens must be sufficiently long-lived to propagate a biochemical signal through the sequential steps of kinase activation and substrate phosphorylation within the T cell."

This phosphorylation occurs on immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), which are conserved sets of sequences bearing two tyrosines separated by ten to twelve residues (<a href=\"#bib46\">Love and Hayes, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Reth, 1989</a>). ZAP-70, a Syk-family kinase with tandem SH2 domains, is recruited to the membrane by binding these doubly-phosphorylated ITAMs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chan et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Iwashima et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wange et al., 1993</a>). ZAP-70 is auto-inhibited before ITAM binding, and its activation requires that it be phosphorylated by Lck, both on its SH2-kinase linker and on the activation loop, a conserved regulatory segment in the kinase domain (<a href=\"#bib22\">Deindl et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Yan et al., 2013</a>)."

In one such complex, the Tec-family kinase Itk binds to phosphorylated SLP-76 through its SH2 domain (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bunnell et al., 2000</a>). Itk phosphorylates and activates phospholipase-C\u03b31 (PLC\u03b31), which is bound to phosphorylated LAT. Signaling by PLC\u03b31 leads to a cytoplasmic calcium increase, thereby initiating part of the transcriptional response of the T cell to activation by antigens (<a href=\"#bib83\">Weiss et al., 1991</a>)."

It is not clear, however, how this sequence of kinase reactions is enforced, given that tyrosine kinases are generally considered to be promiscuous and even 'sloppy' enzymes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mayer, 2012</a>). In this study, we focus on the key molecular features of ZAP-70, Lck, and their substrates that dictate the order of kinase activation and substrate phosphorylation in a T cell. Specifically, we examine why the substrate specificity of ZAP-70 is so narrow that it can only phosphorylate the scaffold proteins LAT and SLP-76 efficiently, and why ZAP-70 cannot phosphorylate and activate itself. We also ask why LAT and SLP-76 are not phosphorylated efficiently by Lck. The avoidance of phosphorylation of these two scaffold proteins by Lck is critical for ensuring that the more tightly regulated kinase, ZAP-70, propagates the signal downstream only after it is activated by Lck."

Our data show that the presence of multiple negatively-charged residues in the vicinity of tyrosines in LAT, and the exclusion of positively-charged ones, allows those tyrosines to be selected through electrostatic interactions with ZAP-70. This sequence pattern also prevents phosphorylation of LAT by Lck. Brownian dynamics and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that ZAP-70 detects the negative charge on LAT and SLP-76 by using a substrate binding region on its catalytic domain that is enriched in positively-charged residues to an extent that appears to be unique among non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Our analysis also suggests that the inability of ZAP-70 to undergo robust autophosphorylation is due to steric and electrostatic repulsion that blocks the adoption of the enzyme-substrate complex in which the activation loop of one kinase domain acts as the substrate for another. This feature appears to be a natural consequence of the specialization of ZAP-70 towards LAT and SLP-76 as preferred substrates."

Recent iterations of this technique utilize positional scanning peptide libraries where degenerate sub-libraries are created in which single amino acid residues are fixed at various positions flanking the tyrosine. All of the sub-libraries are phosphorylated in parallel and then immobilized on a membrane or microarray for high-throughput detection (<a href=\"#bib23\">Deng et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Hutti et al., 2004</a>). While these methods provide a reliable way to determine consensus motifs and can provide insights into kinase specificity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Begley et al., 2015</a>), reliance on the analysis of degenerate mixtures prevents a direct comparison of the effects of specific mutations in particular substrate sequences."

By contrast, Lck substrates typically have both positively- and negatively-charged residues near the tyrosine, and they have a near-neutral net charge. This suggests that high negative charge is likely to be a key determinant of whether a potential target site is phosphorylated by ZAP-70, but the location and number of negatively-charged residues around each of the tyrosines in LAT and\u00a0SLP-76\u00a0is not conserved. There may also be other roles for the negative charge on LAT and SLP-76 that are unrelated to kinase specificity. For example, it was shown recently that LAT phosphorylation results in clustering, and that the phosphatase CD45 is excluded from these LAT clusters because it is negatively-charged (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bunnell et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Su et al., 2016</a>)."

In these libraries, every possible single mutation in a 20 residue peptide segment was represented with near-equal stoichiometry, as verified by DNA sequencing. Each library was screened against the ZAP-70 kinase domain in triplicate or quadruplicate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>). These data allow us to assess the impact of all possible point mutations at a single site on a given peptide, as shown for substitutions of Asp 225 and Glu 231 in the LAT Tyr 226 peptide (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A and B</a>). The data also reveal the impact of individually introducing any particular amino acid residue at all sites within that peptide, as shown for lysine substitutions at each position in the LAT Tyr 226 peptide (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

Replacement of native negatively-charged residues by neutral residues had a mild detrimental effect on phosphorylation efficiency, and introduction of acidic residues at neutral positions was often beneficial (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Consistent with these observations, replacement of a single glutamate residue by lysine, either upstream or downstream of the tyrosine, resulted in a 30\u201340% reduction in the LAT Tyr 226 phosphorylation rate by ZAP-70 in kinase assays using purified peptide substrates, and mutation of multiple glutamates to alanine or lysine residues further reduced phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The deleterious effect of arginine and lysine residues at any position also explains the slow phosphorylation of LAT Tyr 191 by ZAP-70 (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Replacement of Arg 189 (at the \u22122 position) by alanine or aspartate residues successively improved the efficiency of Tyr 191 phosphorylation by ZAP-70 (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Phosphorylation of Tyr 132 is essential for T cell differentiation and function, as it generates the docking site for PLC\u03b31, which initiates calcium signaling (<a href=\"#bib69\">Roncagalli et al., 2010</a>). In our screen for Tyr 132 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), replacement of Gly 131 with virtually any other residue improved the efficiency of phosphorylation by ZAP-70, and the G131D mutation caused a 16-fold enhancement of phosphorylation by ZAP-70 in kinase assays using purified peptides (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Gly 131 in LAT is highly conserved in mammals, and it is also common in other vertebrates (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). PLC\u03b31 binding sites on other proteins do not contain a glycine adjacent to the phosphotyrosine, indicating that this is not a requirement for SH2 domain engagement (<a href=\"#bib42\">Jones et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Leung et al., 2014</a>). A slow rate of phosphorylation at Tyr 132 in LAT may be important for kinetic proofreading during T cell receptor signaling, the significance of which will be explored in future studies."

Mutation of Glu 231 (+5 position) to alanine caused a two-fold increase in the Lck-catalyzed rate of LAT Tyr 226 phosphorylation, suggesting that a downstream negative charge on substrates might repel Lck, and this rate was further enhanced by mutation of that same glutamate residue to lysine (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Located near the active site, and within a substrate-binding site that leads into it, is a loop connecting helices F and G of the kinase domain (the FG loop, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This loop presents four lysine residues towards the substrate (residues 538, 541, 542, and 544).

In Lck, the residues in the FG loop corresponding to Lys 538 and Lys 544 in ZAP-70 are isoleucine and threonine, respectively, which presumably removes the requirement for Asp at the \u22121 position of the substrate and enforces the preference for hydrophobic residues that has been noted previously (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) (<a href=\"#bib77\">Songyang et al., 1995</a>)."

For the LAT Tyr 226 peptide, the upstream residues Glu 219, Glu 220, and Glu 221 formed frequent but transient ion pairs with all four lysine residues on the FG loop as well as with Lys 504.

This mutant ZAP-70 displayed substantially reduced activity against most of the LAT and SLP-76 peptides in kinase assays, and also showed an increased ability to phosphorylate ITAMs, when compared to wild-type ZAP-70 (<a href=\"#fig7s7\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 7</a>).

Replacing Glu 231 (+5 position) in the LAT peptide with lysine reduced phosphorylation by wild-type ZAP-70, but the presence of the lysine in the substrate peptide had no effect on phosphorylation by ZAP-70 with Arg 514 mutated to alanine or glutamate, consistent with the removal of a repulsive interaction (<a href=\"#fig7s9\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 9</a>).

Thus, the Src-family kinases appear to have traded upstream selectivity in substrates for the ability to undergo efficient autophosphorylation on the activation loop.

On average, tyrosine kinase substrates have a near-neutral net charge in proximity to the phospho-acceptor tyrosine, and the residues at the \u22121 position segregate into three groups: bulky-hydrophobic, polar-neutral, and negatively-charged (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Lck substrates, such as the T cell receptor ITAM phosphosites, fall into each of these major categories and are thus representative of typical tyrosine kinase substrates. LAT and SLP-76 phosphosites, however, are distinctive in having both a \u22121 acidic residue and a substantially negative net charge. Both of these features are conserved in LAT sequences across different vertebrates (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>)."

Most of these residues are not conserved in other human non-receptor tyrosine kinases (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>).

This sequence of events is largely dictated by the substrate specificities of the ZAP-70 and Lck kinase domains, which we have defined using a high-throughput assay to measure phosphorylation levels for hundreds of mutant peptides based on natural substrates of these kinases. Unlike Lck, and probably most other tyrosine kinases, ZAP-70 preferentially phosphorylates substrates that are enriched in negatively-charged residues, depleted of positively-charged residues, and have an aspartate at the \u22121 position relative to the phospho-acceptor tyrosine. These features are characteristic of the targets of ZAP-70 in LAT and SLP-76. In accommodating LAT and SLP-76, ZAP-70 not only became a highly specialized kinase but also lost the ability to activate itself by <i>trans</i>-autophosphorylation. This coupling between substrate recognition and autophosphorylation in ZAP-70, along with the electrostatic features of LAT and SLP-76, insulate these proteins from undesirable cross-talk with other signaling molecules (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>)."

Upon peptide-MHC interaction with the T cell receptor and its co-receptors, Lck is repositioned near its favored substrates, the ITAMs within the cytoplasmic tails of the T cell receptor complex. This ensures not only the appropriate Lck-mediated phosphorylation of ITAMs but also the proper recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of ZAP-70 by Lck.

Furthermore, B cell activation can be considered more flexible, because Syk can slowly auto-activate (<a href=\"#bib80\">Tsang et al., 2008</a>) and it can phosphorylate ITAMs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Chu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Mukherjee et al., 2013</a>), thereby making the Src-family kinase somewhat expendable (<a href=\"#bib79\">Takata et al., 1994</a>).

These subtle differences between T and B cells underscore how signaling pathways and their corresponding molecules have evolved to achieve varying degrees of control.

Initially, the human LAT sequence was used as the query, and in additional rounds of searches, sequences from non-mammal vertebrates were used to find sequences from more distantly-related organisms. Subject sequences identified in the BLAST searches were kept if they met three criteria: (1) the N-terminal ~30 amino acids should be predominantly hydrophobic and followed by a 'CXXC' lipidation motif, consistent with the membrane anchor in human and mouse LAT, (2) the C-terminal ~100 amino acids should contain at least 3 or 4 tyrosine residues, and (3) the tyrosine residues should be surrounded by sequences that resemble SH2 binding sites: for example, the Y[I/L]XV motif at Tyr 132 represents a PLC\u03b31 binding site (<a href=\"#bib76\">Songyang et al., 1993</a>). Using this approach, we identified 43 mammalian LAT sequences and 16 non-mammalian vertebrate LAT sequences. The regions surrounding each tyrosine were manually aligned with no gaps, and sequence logos were generated using the online tool WebLogo (<a href=\"#bib21\">Crooks et al., 2004</a>)."

In total, 87 ZAP-70 orthologs were unambiguously identified in organisms ranging from cartilaginous fish to mammals. Sequences were aligned using the T-Coffee multiple sequence alignment program (<a href=\"#bib58\">Notredame et al., 2000</a>), and the sequence logo was generated using WebLogo (<a href=\"#bib21\">Crooks et al., 2004</a>)."

As of May 14, 2016, the dataset contained over 16,000 kinase-substrate pairs from a variety of organisms. This parent list was filtered to only select human kinase-substrate pairs in which a substrate tyrosine was the reported phosphosite, resulting in 1118 non-redundant substrate sequences. Each sequence comprised 7 residues upstream and 7 residues downstream of the tyrosine phosphosite. The net charge of each sequence was estimated by summing the number of lysine and arginine residues and subtracting the sum of the number of aspartate and glutamate residues. Sequences were sorted based on net charge and the identity of the \u22121 residue relative to the phosphosite. The \u22121 residue similarities were assessed based on the BLOSUM score relative to aspartate (<a href=\"#bib29\">Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992</a>)."

The eCPX scaffold allows us to display two peptides per scaffold on the bacterial surface (<a href=\"#bib68\">Rice and Daugherty, 2008</a>). In our experiments, the N-terminus of eCPX was fused to the substrate peptide, and the C-terminus was fused to a Strep-tag (with the sequence WSHPQFEK), which we can detect using a sequence-specific antibody and thus use as a marker for surface-display level. Here, we describe the variation in surface-display levels for different wild-type parent peptides, as well as mutant peptides in a scanning mutagenesis library. We first describe the results for different parent peptides."

There have been many peptide library approaches to the primary substrate specificity of protein kinases in general and tyrosine kinases specifically, and these have generally been disappointingly inconclusive about predicting or clarifying physiologic substrate information. This manuscript though breaks new ground in generating methods and principles that seem likely to be reliable and of broad interest to the kinase field. There are several notable features. First, the manuscript convincingly confirms the role of local amino acids in influencing the specificity of ZAP-70 vs. Lck. Using a combination of bacterial display libraries and synthetic peptides, the authors make these distinctions clear and enlightening. Second, the authors uncover the structural basis for the Lck vs. ZAP-70 selectivity. This is probably the most novel and important part of the manuscript. Using computational methods, the authors predicted a basic cluster in the ZAP-70 catalytic domain, not present in Lck, which serves to repel basic residues in the vicinity of the target Tyr in substrates and is attracted to acidic residues in substrates. They elegantly confirm this using synthetic peptide substrates and cellular transfection assays. This is a triumph for molecular simulation. Third, taking these findings into account, the authors generate a model of how activation loop trans-autophosphorylation takes place. The basis of such autophosphorylation has been vexing for the field and the authors make a good case for why ZAP-70 cannot activate itself but Lck (and many other TKs) can. One of the highlights of the paper was the use of transfection experiments and chimeric tyrosine kinases that helped validate the model. Fourth, the authors use a Brownian motion simulation in a productive way to understand substrate specificity, not yet a mainstream endeavor in protein/enzyme analysis. Overall, this paper is rich with insight and novelty that should be of great interest to the readers of <i>eLife</i>, although we ask the authors to consider the points below."

For example, the mutants shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> span a range of -1 to 1 in log<sub>10</sub>(enrichment), and this corresponds to a 2- to 3-fold change in phosphorylation rate. This reflects the fact that the wild-type peptide, surrounding LAT Tyr 226, is a good substrate for ZAP-70, and thus individual substitutions only have a modest, albeit measurable, effect. By contrast, for ZAP-70 phosphorylation of a poor substrate, the peptide encompassing LAT Tyr 132 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), substitutions at Gly 131 have a log<sub>10</sub>(enrichment) of roughly 1, but this can correspond to a 16-fold enhancement in phosphorylation rate (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).
