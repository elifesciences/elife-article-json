We find that while the response of mouse CD4+ T cells to antigenic stimulation is bimodal, activated cells exhibit analog responses proportional to signal strength. Gene expression output reflects TCR signal strength, providing a signature of T cell activation. Expression changes rely on a pre-established enhancer landscape and quantitative acetylation at AP-1 binding sites. Finally, we show that graded expression of activation genes depends on ERK pathway activation, suggesting that an ERK-AP-1 axis plays an important role in translating TCR signal strength into proportional activation of enhancers and genes essential for T cell function."

We find that while the response of mouse CD4+ T cells to antigenic stimulation is bimodal, activated cells exhibit analog responses proportional to signal strength. Gene expression output reflects TCR signal strength, providing a signature of T cell activation. Expression changes rely on a pre-established enhancer landscape and quantitative acetylation at AP-1 binding sites. Finally, we show that graded expression of activation genes depends on ERK pathway activation, suggesting that an ERK-AP-1 axis plays an important role in translating TCR signal strength into proportional activation of enhancers and genes essential for T cell function."

The TCR binds to antigen presented by the molecules encoded by the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) such that strength of the TCR signal in response to a particular peptide-MHC complex (pMHC) is dependent on all three components\u2013 the antigenic peptide, the MHC, and the TCR itself (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heber-Katz et al., 1982</a>). Variations in signal efficiency are thus caused by the generated TCR sequence (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hedrick et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jerne, 1971</a>), genetic differences in MHC (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heber-Katz et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hedrick et al., 1982</a>), and the peptide being presented (<a href=\"#bib73\">Solinger et al., 1979</a>). Even small differences in the number or affinity of these pMHC-TCR interactions are read by the TCR and have important consequences for the nature and extent CD4+ T cell activation; high-affinity interactions lead to inflammatory responses at a lower concentration of antigen, increased Interleukin 2 (IL2) and IFN\u03b3 production, and increased proliferation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heber-Katz et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hedrick et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Solinger et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alexander, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Rogers and Peptide dose, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Rogers et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sloan-Lancaster et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Tubo et al., 2013</a>), whereas lower affinity interactions can lead to incomplete phosphorylation of downstream signaling complexes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kersh et al., 1998b</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Sloan-Lancaster et al., 1994</a>), anergy (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sloan-Lancaster et al., 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib72\">1994</a>), or TCR antagonism (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alexander, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kersh et al., 1998b</a>).

In particular, AP-1, which comprises homo- or heterodimers assembled from proteins of the Fos, Jun, and ATF transcription factor families (<a href=\"#bib54\">Murphy et al., 2013</a>), requires both TCR and co-stimulatory signaling (<a href=\"#bib65\">Rinc\u00f3n and Flavell, 1994</a>), and it is usually activated by the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk pathway (<a href=\"#bib53\">Murphy and Blenis, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Schade and Cutting edge, 2004</a>).

In this study, we address the question of affinity at the level of the chromatin. We take advantage of the PCC system to assess the effects of varying the dose and affinity of peptide presentation to CD4+ T cells on enhancer formation and gene expression, giving us a genome-wide picture of how TCR signaling is able to achieve such highly specific responses despite its apparent digital signaling pattern. We find first that the digital/analog dichotomy is too simple, and instead CD4+ T cells respond to ligands of varying dose and affinity by modulating both the frequency of responding cells and the level of activation of responding cells at a single cell level. In other words, activation markers are analog with respect to the strength of TCR signaling when comparing across doses and affinities, but for any single dose and affinity, the overall signaling pattern is digital for the population of cells. We next show that at the population level, the combined effects of analog precision and increasing frequency of responder cells produce gene expression patterns that directly reflect the strength of TCR signaling for a set of activation signature genes. These gene expression patterns can be used to assess CD4+ T cell activation status, and we develop a tool for ranking arbitrary CD4+ T cell populations by activation score. Underlying these gene expression patterns, we find that the enhancer landscape is largely pre-existing, such that TCR engagement results in activation of primed enhancers rather than through selection of new enhancers. Finally, we show that the graded activation score and the expression of activation signature genes are dependent on the amount of phosphorylated ERK activity downstream of the TCR. Together, these results suggest that the degree of ERK activation translates the analog TCR signal resulting from varying the dose and affinity of TCR engagement into downstream gene expression programs."

CD4+ T cells and CD11c+ antigen presenting cells (APCs) were isolated from AND transgenic mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) and co-cultured for 24\u2009hr with one of a panel of previously described (<a href=\"#bib66\">Rogers and Peptide dose, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Rogers et al., 1998</a>) peptides at several different doses. Cell activation was then measured at a single cell level using flow cytometry. As expected, for each given peptide and dose, CD4+ T cells followed a digital pattern, appearing either all-on or all-off according to extracellular activation markers such as CD69 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and CD25 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Increasing the peptide dose or affinity significantly increased the percent of activated cells in the population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). However, when we compared across peptides and concentrations, it was clear that the activation level of the on-state cells was not 'all on.' Gating on CD69+ cells, each different peptide and different dose of a peptide achieved a different amount of CD69 per cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Gating on CD25+ cells yields similar results, with varying amounts of CD25 expressed per cell dependent on both the dose and the affinity of the stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Thus, while under a given condition the CD4+ T cells were either on or off as per classical digital signaling, when comparing across a panel of conditions, the activation level of the on-state cells is analog with respect to the strength of the TCR signal."

We compared samples from several publicly available datasets, and the activation score was able to quantitatively rank conditions within a given experiment set such that activated and na\u00efve CD4+ T cells could be distinguished and further that the effects of various genetic perturbations of CD4+ T cell responses could be observed. For example, the activation score correctly recapitulated the findings that polarized helper subsets of CD4+ T cells were more pro-inflammatory than unstimulated cells or induced and natural regulatory T cells (<a href=\"#bib86\">Wei et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>); that at the population level plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 induced stronger activation signals than APCs plus antigen (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tan et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>); that costimulation was important for achieving higher activation states but checkpoint inhibitors could block this effect (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wakamatsu et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>); that knockout of Trim28, a molecule necessary for optimal IL2 production, diminished CD4+ T cell activation status (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chikuma et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>); and that acute LCMV infection produced more robust activation in CD4+ T cells than chronic infection (<a href=\"#bib18\">Doering et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

The score correctly captures that 100 \u03bcM K99A and 0.1 \u03bcM PCC are very similar in activation status. Note that the score ranks samples within an experiment, but is not an absolute metric for comparing across experiment groups. (<b>B</b>) The activation score can be used to compare arbitrary CD4+ T cell data sets. Here, activation scores were calculated for microarrays from helper T cell subsets, and they demonstrate that na\u00efve cells and native regulatory T cells (nTregs) are less classically activated than Th1, Th2, and Th17 polarized subsets. (<b>C</b>) The activation score captures the fact that plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation of helper T cell subsets results in stronger signaling than antigen as presented by APCs. (<b>D</b>) CD4+ T cells were subjected to a variety of stimulatory or inhibitory treatments: anti-CD3 alone, or anti-CD3 with anti-CD28, anti-BTLA, anti-CD80, anti-CTLA4, anti-ICOS, or anti-PD1. Gene expression profiles at early (1\u00a0hr and 4\u00a0hr) and late (20\u00a0hr and 48\u00a0hr) time points yield activation scores in line with the characterization of CD28, BTLA, CD80, and ICOS as co-stimulatory, and CTLA4 and PD1 as inhibitory. Although it might be expected that anti-CD80 would have an inhibitory effect, these results are in line with the conclusions from the originally published analysis. (<b>E</b>) Na\u00efve CD4+ splenocytes were isolated from 39 mouse strains. Using the PC1-derived activation score, we can rank the CD4+ cells from each strain as either more or less activated under basal conditions. Using the activation score, we recapitulate the finding that C57Bl6 mice have more pro-inflammatory cells than BALB/c mice. The highest scoring strain, DBA/2, shows top-quartile expression of immune effectors as well as protein biosynthesis genes.

From top to bottom, the cells indicated are: Embryonic stem cells; Lin<sup>\u2212</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> (LSK) hematopoietic progenitor cells; fetal liver derived double negative 1 thymocytes; fetal liver derived double negative 2a thymocytes; fetal liver derived double negative 2b thymocytes; double negative 3 thymocytes; double positive thymocytes; Th1 polarized CD4+ T cells; Th2 polarized CD4+ T cells; Th1 polarized CD4+ T cells from a Stat1 knockout model; thioglycollate-elicited macrophages; and the adipocyte-derived 3T3L1 cell line. (<b>F</b>) De novo motif finding identifies lineage-determining transcription factor (LDTF) motifs among H3K27Ac-marked enhancers shared by the five conditions. As with the primed enhancers, the ETS family motif and a RUNX motif are highly enriched. (<b>G</b>) Among activated enhancers shared by all five conditions, pro-inflammatory transcription factor motifs are enriched. As in primed enhancers, IRF, NF-\u03baB, and AP-1 motifs are all enriched in the shared H3K27Ac peaks. (<b>H</b>) As seen with BATF, deposition of H3K27Ac, a marker of transcription factor activity, reflects increasing TCR signal strength at the genome-wide binding sites of the AP-1 family member JunB. I. Similarly, deposition of H3K27Ac reflects increasing TCR signal strength at the genome-wide binding sites of the AP-1 family member cJun."

Given the fact that the AP-1 motif was enriched at enhancers showing increasing activity and the fact that AP-1 binding sites saw increasing H3K27Ac deposition, we sought to determine whether AP-1 and the ERK pathway were relevant to the increasing expression of activation signature genes across the conditions. We first compared the level of phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) in each condition using flow cytometry, and found that, like CD69 and CD25, the amount of p-ERK in the p-ERK+ cells varied on a per-cell basis in each condition, increasing with TCR signal strength (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Frequency of pERK+ cells also differed across peptide conditions (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicating that both frequency and single-cell response level play a role in the effect of MEK inhibitors. As the increasing levels of p-ERK paralleled the general pattern of expression of the activation signature genes, we assessed binding frequencies of AP-1 factors in the gene promoters of the activation signature genes as compared to the bottom 10% of PC1 genes, and found that activation signature genes showed a significantly higher frequency of AP-1 binding (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This enrichment for AP-1 binding was not dependent on the expression level of the genes in each group, as segmenting the genes by RPKM showed the same pattern (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Here, we have shown that the traditional model of a purely digital TCR response is too simple; on a per-cell basis, stronger TCR signals result in higher levels of phosphorylated ERK, a proportional increase in enhancer acetylation, and quantitative increases in activation markers such as CD69 and CD25 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). As a result of both these single-cell differences and the increasing frequency of respondent cells, varying the dose or the affinity of the pMHC-TCR interaction results in a gene expression profile that is graded corresponding to increasing strength of TCR signaling. We observed no evidence for Th1/Th2 skewing as a function of peptide dose/affinity, which may reflect the specific peptides used for stimulation. Notably, the predominance of PC1 and the graded gene expression patterns together indicate that dose and affinity are not interpreted separately downstream of the TCR, but rather overall signaling strength sets the level of activation across the population. A similar conclusion has been drawn by looking at the sum of activation parameters induced by antigen-, co-stimulatory- and cytokine-receptors (<a href=\"#bib48\">Marchingo, 2014</a>)."

Intriguingly, different levels of responses were seen when na\u00efve cells were compared with blast and memory cell responses, such that the rate of TNF and IL2 synthesis in blasts and memory cells was nearly ten-fold higher than in na\u00efve cells. Our findings are consistent with these earlier studies in that TNF and IL2 are members of the \u2018digital\u2019 class of RNAs identified in CD69+ cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

Surprisingly, we did not find significant changes in the primed enhancer landscape upon TCR activation in CD4+ T cells. Similarly, even the more labile activation mark H3K27Ac was largely similar across conditions, with many activation genes marked as super-enhancers even before stimulation. While it remains to be seen whether non-TCR signaling pathways or polarizing conditions induce more dramatic changes, the data presented here indicates that the CD4+ T cell enhancer landscape is largely pre-established, with subsets of H3K4me2-marked enhancers increasing in activity, but little in the way of de novo enhancer establishment.

Low-dose MEK inhibition selectively decreased expression of the activation signature genes such that the activation score under the inhibited conditions was incrementally decreased. This indicates that the analog levels of pERK seen on a per-cell basis are translated at a population level into increased enhancer and gene activity, and that 'turning down' pERK levels selectively diminishes the activation status of the cells. This finding is of particular interest in light of the clinical availability of numerous RAF, MEK, and ERK inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib90\">Zhao and Adjei, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Samatar and Poulikakos, 2014</a>). Our findings suggest that low-dose ERK pathway inhibition could be used to selectively decrease the activity of activation signature genes in CD4+ T cells, achieving low-level immunosuppression without killing T cells or completely removing their ability to respond to TCR signaling. Further, the effect of MEK inhibitors on CD4+ T cells raises questions about the immunosuppressive effects of using MEK inhibitors in cancer treatment, especially as current clinical trials combine MEK inhibitors with checkpoint-blockade inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib90\">Zhao and Adjei, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Vella et al., 2014</a>)."

While several aspects of T cell activation have been described as digital or analog, the authors contend that this dichotomy is too simple. They show at a single time point that the MFI of CD69 and CD25 of responding cells correlated with the relative strengths of TCR stimulation. To determine how titration of ligand affinity affected the transcriptional responses, the authors used RNA-seq and principal component analysis to identify a subset of \"activation signature genes\" which responded in a graded manner to peptide affinity and dose. ChIP-seq was used to compare the extent of epigenetic tagging of enhancers and showed that the degree of H3K4me2 tagging of activation signature genes increased in a graded manner in response to changes in TCR stimulation strength. Motif analysis also revealed that enhancers that became more active with TCR signal strength were enriched for AP-1 and NFkB sites. To determine how this subset of activation signature genes responded to perturbation of the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk pathway, the authors performed ChIP-seq analysis on T cells stimulated with partial Mek inhibition. Consistent with the top 10% of PC1 genes having a bias toward genes containing AP-1 sites, the activation signature genes were appreciably more susceptible to Mek inhibition than the bottom 10%. The authors conclude that the ERK pathway is responsible for translating varying strengths of TCR stimuli into similarly graded enhancer activity."

As a result, it is not possible to determine whether the graded gene expression/epigenetic changes occur due to graded responses homogenously in every cell, or due to decreasing frequencies of responding cells as the affinity of stimulating peptide is decreased. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> the authors demonstrate this heterogeneity at a single cell level that decreasing the potency of TCR stimulus decreases the frequency of cells that express CD69 and CD25. This is not to say that there may be graded responses amongst the responding cells. The data generated by flow cytometry in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> demonstrate that the MFI of CD25, CD69 and phospho-ERK can be dose dependent, when gated on the responding cells. One should note, however, that they only do their flow analysis at a single time point and it is not clear that maximal responses have been reached at lower doses of peptides or with weaker peptides. Regardless, however, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses on bulk populations cannot formally discriminate whether the signals detected come from each cell equally or from a subpopulation of cells. A more informative experiment would involve sorting the CD69+ cells after stimulation with varying concentrations/affinities of peptide, and then performing RNA-seq or ChIP-seq."

Indeed, much biochemical effort has been focused on the first minutes of T cell activation (e.g. biophysics of TCR/pMHC interaction, or dynamics of signaling response or synapse formation). In these settings, T cell activation (as measured by NFAT translocation or ERK phosphorylation among others) was found to be essentially digital, with the frequency of cells getting activated increasing with increasing doses or increasing quality of antigens. On the other hand, the typical degree of activation (amongst activated cells, as measured by the mode of ppERK or NFAT activation) was found to be essentially constant on short timescale (e.g. t&lt;30min), although recent work in the EGFR pathway argued for frequency encoding of activation strength (Albeck et al., 2013). T cell activation and regulation of immune responses occur over longer timescales (&gt; hr): this opens up opportunities for T cells to register, in an analog manner, quantity and quality of antigens, while short-term responses were essentially digital."

The authors argue that the dominant mode of regulation is the amplitude of signaling amongst activated cells. This conclusion is supported qualitatively by the application of MEK inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), although the authors fail to report that the impact of MEK inhibition is solely on the mode of ERK phosphorylation and not on the frequency of T cell activation. Yet, most outputs are measured in bulk (e.g. by sequencing of a population of sorted cells) except for <i>Tbet</i> and <i>Irf4</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Thus changes in gene regulation may be dominated by the changes in frequency of activated cells rather than by changes in the modes of activated cells. Overall, a direct quantitative test of this observation is not carried out: changes in frequency of activated T cells and mode of gene upregulation are confounding consequences of antigenic activation that must be better deconvolved at the individual cell level."

Using publicly available data and new datasets acquired in-house, the authors derive a gene signature that encompasses the dominant mode of variation of gene up/down regulation in T lymphocytes. Surprisingly, a single score derived from a simple principal component analysis is shown to encompass almost completely the variability of T cell gene regulation (at homeostasis or under activation). Moreover, this PCA score is shown to report back the strength of activation in different settings (with/without costimulation, with/without involvement of Trim28 etc.): this result is striking as it implies that T cell activation can be quantified as the sum of input signal -a similar result was recently reported by the Hodgkin group (Marchingo et al., 2014). The results and analysis presented here by Allison et al. in terms of gene regulation is very exhaustive and adds to our quantitative understanding of T cell activation."

This is an interesting observation that would require further investigation: does it imply stronger or weaker responsiveness to antigen stimulation? This issue of potential tuning to constitutive TCR stimulation is long standing (Mandl et al., 2013), and possibly beyond the scope of this study. Still, a more quantitative analysis is warranted to test the strength of this quantitative correlation e.g. using partial least square regression to identify the latent variables (antigen quantity and quality, frequency of response, mode of response) that best account for the measured variability in gene output (Kemp et al., 2007)."

In the revised manuscript, the authors have added new experimental data that address this major concern. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> shows graded expression of a single example, <i>Irf4</i> transcripts, amongst the CD69+ cells that respond to APC/peptides of varying affinity, and the rest of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> shows RNA-Seq data from the CD69+ cells sorted from a bulk population of activated T cells.

As a result, it is not possible to determine whether the graded gene expression/epigenetic changes occur due to graded responses homogenously in every cell, or due to decreasing frequencies of responding cells as the affinity of stimulating peptide is decreased. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> the authors demonstrate this heterogeneity at a single cell level that decreasing the potency of TCR stimulus decreases the frequency of cells that express CD69 and CD25. This is not to say that there may be graded responses amongst the responding cells. The data generated by flow cytometry in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> demonstrate that the MFI of CD25, CD69 and phospho-ERK can be dose dependent, when gated on the responding cells. One should note, however, that they only do their flow analysis at a single time point and it is not clear that maximal responses have been reached at lower doses of peptides or with weaker peptides. Regardless, however, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses on bulk populations cannot formally discriminate whether the signals detected come from each cell equally or from a subpopulation of cells. A more informative experiment would involve sorting the CD69+ cells after stimulation with varying concentrations/affinities of peptide, and then performing RNA-seq or ChIP-seq.</i>"

The issue of bulk vs activated cells is also raised by Reviewer #2. To address this concern, we first performed mRNA flow cytometry, in which fluorescent probes are hybridized to target mRNA and analyzed with traditional flow cytometry, resulting in single cell mRNA data. RNA flow experiments demonstrated a graded response in IRF4 mRNA in the responding cells. These results are presented in new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. A limitation of the RNA flow technology in our hands was that the dynamic range of IRF4 induction was much lower than that observed using RNA-Sequencing, likely due to the technology used to amplify and detect the mRNA target. Therefore, to confirm this observation and look genome-wide, we conducted RNA-sequencing on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells treated as before, but sorted by expression of the activation marker CD69, thereby selectively analyzing responder cells. Although there were interesting differences from RNA-Seq results obtained in the bulk population as elaborated on below, we found that the first principal component again reflected the strength of signaling, with 10\u03bcM K99A the leftmost sample along PC1, and 1\u03bcM PCC the rightmost sample. This result is shown in new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>. This is further illustrated by the mean expression levels of mRNAs corresponding to the upper 10% of PC1, which exhibit a clear dependence on dose and affinity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The dominant functional annotations are associated with protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis (3E), also consistent with the functional annotations associated with the corresponding genes identified in the bulk RNA-seq experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Examples of genes involved in translational initiation or ribosome biogenesis that exhibit analogue responses are illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> and G. We also observed a cluster of genes that exhibited a digital response \u2013 i.e., maximal or near maximal expression in the small number of CD69 responding cells recovered after treatment with the low dose of the low affinity peptide (10\u03bcM K99A) in comparison to expression in the much larger number of cells recovered after treatment with the high dose of the high affinity ligand (1\u03bcM PCC). The top 100 genes from this cluster are illustrated in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>. Interestingly, this cluster of genes is enriched for functional annotations for immune response (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>), with representative genes illustrated in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>. Therefore, analogue signals for these mRNAs in the bulk RNA sequencing experiment primarily reflect differences in frequencies of responding cells. This implies first that the graded levels of immune response genes seen at the protein level in single cells is a result of post-transcriptional regulation, rather than transcriptional regulation. Mechanisms that account for both digital and analogue responses within responsive cells remain to be established, but may be partly due to differences in kinetics, which are beyond the scope of the present studies. Nevertheless, we think that these results substantially strengthen and extend our original conclusions that both the frequency of responding cells and the per- cell strength of response contribute to the population response to antigens of varying concentration and/or affinity."

The authors argue that the dominant mode of regulation is the amplitude of signaling amongst activated cells. This conclusion is supported qualitatively by the application of MEK inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), although the authors fail to report that the impact of MEK inhibition is solely on the mode of ERK phosphorylation and not on the frequency of T cell activation. Yet, most outputs are measured in bulk (e.g. by sequencing of a population of sorted cells) except for Tbet and Irf4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Thus changes in gene regulation may be dominated by the changes in frequency of activated cells rather than by changes in the modes of activated cells. Overall, a direct quantitative test of this observation is not carried out: changes in frequency of activated T cells and mode of gene upregulation are confounding consequences of antigenic activation that must be better deconvolved at the individual cell level.</i>"

Surprisingly, a single score derived from a simple principal component analysis is shown to encompass almost completely the variability of T cell gene regulation (at homeostasis or under activation). Moreover, this PCA score is shown to report back the strength of activation in different settings (with/without costimulation, with/without involvement of Trim28 etc.): this result is striking as it implies that T cell activation can be quantified as the sum of input signal -a similar result was recently reported by the Hodgkin group (Marchingo et al., 2014).

For example, CD69-positive cells responding to the low affinity peptide have a lower activation score than CD69-positive cells responding to the high affinity peptide. We found this to be the case regardless of whether we used bulk population RNA-Seq data or RNA-Seq data obtained from responding cells. This is mostly due to lower levels of expression of genes required for protein translation and ribosomal biogenesis, which are presumably required for proliferation and various T cell effector functions.

One problem we became aware of during preparation of the revised version of the manuscript is that the DAVID tool for gene ontology has not been updated in 6 years. We therefore repeated the GO analysis using Metascape, which is updated on a continuous basis. The results are qualitatively similar, but this analysis captures more annotations. Terms related to protein synthesis still dominate the top of the list, but many terms related to immune response are also captured. These new results are provided in the revised <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>. In addition, we performed RNA-Seq of responding (CD69+) cells to confirm results of bulk RNA Seq experiments as requested by Reviewers #1 and #2.

However, we also identified a \u2018digital\u2019 cluster in the responding population of cells that was not apparent in the bulk sequencing experiment.

This difference could very well be explained by the induction of the protein biosynthetic machinery observed in our studies and is now pointed out in the discussion. In addition, we also note that the RNA-seq analysis of CD69+ cells identified a digital cluster of genes that includes <i>Tnf</i> and <i>Il2</i>. Bar graphs for these and additional representative mRNAs are now included in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panel E. Thus, our findings are consistent with those of Huang et al. with respect to both changes in synthetic capacity and digital induction of <i>Tnf</i> and <i>Il2</i>. It will be of interest to further investigate mechanisms enabling gene-specific analogue or digital responses within the same cell."
