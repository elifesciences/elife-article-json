To resolve this controversy, we have applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which reveals the precise position of histone H4 in every nucleosome in the genome. We find that cleavage patterns at centromeres are unique within the genome and are incompatible with symmetrical structures, including octameric nucleosomes and (Cse4/H4)<sub>2</sub> tetrasomes. Centromere cleavage patterns are compatible with a precisely positioned core structure, one in which each of the 16 yeast centromeres is occupied by oppositely oriented Cse4/H4/H2A/H2B hemisomes in two rotational phases within the population. Centromere-specific hemisomes are also inferred from distances observed between closely-spaced H4 cleavages, as predicted from structural modeling. Our results indicate that the orientation and rotational position of the stable hemisome at each yeast centromere is not specified by the functional centromere sequence."

To resolve this controversy, we have applied H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping, which reveals the precise position of histone H4 in every nucleosome in the genome. We find that cleavage patterns at centromeres are unique within the genome and are incompatible with symmetrical structures, including octameric nucleosomes and (Cse4/H4)<sub>2</sub> tetrasomes. Centromere cleavage patterns are compatible with a precisely positioned core structure, one in which each of the 16 yeast centromeres is occupied by oppositely oriented Cse4/H4/H2A/H2B hemisomes in two rotational phases within the population. Centromere-specific hemisomes are also inferred from distances observed between closely-spaced H4 cleavages, as predicted from structural modeling. Our results indicate that the orientation and rotational position of the stable hemisome at each yeast centromere is not specified by the functional centromere sequence."

When cells divide, for example, pairs of \u2018sister chromosomes\u2019 are pulled apart to ensure that the two daughter cells both have the same chromosomes as the original cell. The sister chromosomes are pulled apart from a single position called a centromere, and the nucleosomes at this position contain a histone that is different from the histones found everywhere else in the cell. However, until recently it was not clear if the nucleosomes that contained these special cenH3 histones had the same structure as other nucleosomes."

Furthermore, each nucleosome at a centromere can adopt one of two orientations: these orientations are mirror images of each other, and they occur with equal probability. It should also be possible to use the mapping technique developed by Henikoff et al. to study the larger and more complex centromeres found in other organisms, including humans."

There is general agreement in the centromere field that the central determinant of centromere identity and propagation is the special centromeric nucleosome containing the cenH3 (CENP-A in mammals and Cse4 in budding yeast) histone variant (<a href=\"#bib44\">Quenet and Dalal, 2012</a>). CenH3 nucleosomes have been shown to occupy the centromeres of nearly all eukaryotes studied, and to be necessary for kinetochore formation. Despite the central importance of this nucleosome, its composition and structure have been the subject of controversy. In vitro and in vivo studies have led to proposals for several mutually exclusive models, including conventional octameric (cenH3/H4/H2B/H2A)<sub>2</sub> nucleosomes (\u2018octasomes\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Camahort et al., 2009</a>), cenH3/H4/H2B/H2A half-nucleosomes (\u2018hemisomes\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dalal et al., 2007</a>), (cenH3/H4)<sub>2</sub> tetrasomes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aravamudhan et al., 2013</a>), mixed (cenH3/H3/H4<sub>2</sub>/H2B<sub>2</sub>/H2A<sub>2</sub>) octasomes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lochmann and Ivanov, 2012</a>) and (cenH3/H4/Scm3)<sub>2</sub> hexasomes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mizuguchi et al., 2007</a>), where Scm3 is a cenH3-specific histone chaperone."

The functional centromere has a tripartite organization: the 8 bp CDEI sequence is a binding site for the Cbf1 protein, the Cse4 nucleosome maps to the 78\u201386 bp CDEII sequence, and the 26 bp CDEIII sequence is a binding site for the Cbf3 complex (<a href=\"http://www.yeastgenome.org\">http://www.yeastgenome.org</a>). Our previous native chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) study has resolved all three particles at base-pair resolution, confirming that the Cse4-containing nucleosome is confined to CDEII (<a href=\"#bib34\">Krassovsky et al., 2012</a>). The implied single wrap of DNA around the Cse4-containing histone core is consistent with previous evidence that the Cse4 nucleosome wraps DNA in a right-handed orientation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib23\">Furuyama and Henikoff, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Huang et al., 2011</a>), opposite to the left-handed wrap of conventional nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tachiwana et al., 2011</a>). However, conflicting structural interpretations have continued to appear, with some authors arguing for partially unwrapped octasomes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dunleavy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hasson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Miell et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Padeganeh et al., 2013</a>), others for cenH3/H4 octasomes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lochmann and Ivanov, 2012</a>), others for tetrasomes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aravamudhan et al., 2013</a>), and others for hemisomes throughout the cell cycle but octasomes at anaphase (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shivaraju et al., 2012</a>). Although there have been suggestions of more than one Cse4 nucleosome per budding yeast centromere based on fluorescent microscopy (<a href=\"#bib13\">Coffman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lawrimore et al., 2011</a>), more recent evidence confirms that there is only one particle per centromere (<a href=\"#bib30\">Henikoff and Henikoff, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shivaraju et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Haase et al., 2013</a>). As budding yeast is the only model organism where there is a 1:1 relationship between the cenH3 nucleosome and the microtubule attachment site (<a href=\"#bib22\">Furuyama and Biggins, 2007</a>), any conclusion concerning its composition and structure has an unequivocal functional interpretation."

H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping determines the precise position and orientation of all histone H4 molecules in an unbiased manner (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brogaard et al., 2012a</a>). By mapping the obligate H4 partner of Cse4, we avoid potential complications arising from the need for antibodies, tags, nucleases or fluorescence. As H4 is the obligate partner of every H3 in the genome, this method provides \u223c75,000 positive control H3 nucleosomes to compare against the 16 Cse4 nucleosomes at centromeres. There are important advantages to this approach to mapping yeast centromeres over previous mapping methods, such as Micrococcal Nuclease with sequencing (MNase-seq) and native ChIP. Unlike MNase, an endo-exonuclease that preferentially cleaves linkers between nucleosomes and so provides a map of regions protected from cleavage, H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping determines base-pair positions <i>within</i> the particle. This means that mapping is not complicated by exonucleolytic \u2018nibbling\u2019 and internal cleavages that can lead to uncertainty as to the true size of a particle. In addition, CDEIIs are &gt;90% A+T, and MNase prefers AT-rich regions, resulting in preferential exonucleolytic digestion and loss of centromeric DNA, whereas H4S47C-anchored cleavage is exclusively endonucleolytic and has no sequence bias. When combined with paired-end deep sequencing, H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping provides precise center-to-center distances between adjacent particles that can be used to infer interactions between neighboring nucleosomes and to probe higher-order structural properties without chromatin solubilization. Most importantly for the problem being addressed in this study, H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping predicts very different cleavage patterns for octasomes and tetrasomes, which are symmetrical, than for hemisomes, which are asymmetrical."

Rather, the pattern and cleavage distances indicate mutually exclusive occupancy of CDEII by oppositely oriented hemisomes in two rotational phases at similar frequencies. Our findings reveal surprising flexibility in orientation and phasing for a nucleosome particle that is tightly confined within an asymmetric \u223c80-bp DNA loop."

It appeared that cleavages at centromeres were different from cleavages at other nucleosomes, although the empirical model used to interpret cleavage patterns did not permit further inferences concerning the structure and composition of the particle over centromeric DNA. Specifically, cleavages at the two closely spaced H4S47C residues can potentially result in &lt;10-bp DNA duplexes that cannot be uniquely mapped in the genome, making the empirical approach unsuitable for discriminating cleavage patterns generated by single H4S47C residues in Cse4 hemisomes from those generated by two H4S47C residues in a canonical nucleosome. Therefore, we applied molecular dynamics simulations based on the high-resolution structure of the nucleosome core particle (<a href=\"#bib16\">Davey et al., 2002</a>) with a single phenanthroline group attached by derivatizing the cysteine sulfide with N(1,10-phenanthroline-5-yl)iodoacetamide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The phenanthroline moiety chelates a copper ion, and when it contacts the C-1 hydrogen (C1H) of deoxyribose through a hydroxyl radical, initiates a series of elimination reactions that result in strand cleavages, releasing the deoxyribonucleotide and leaving 5\u2032- and 3\u2032- phosphate ends (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sutton et al., 1993</a>). The simulations sampled possible conformations of a single H4S47C-phenanthroline-Cu<sup>+</sup> in the context of the nucleosome, while the DNA and the rest of the protein were held static (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). From these simulations, we observed that the copper can be within 4 \u00c5 of the C1H atoms at \u22122, \u22123, and \u22124 on the Watson strand and \u22125, \u22126 on the Crick strand with respect to the nucleosome dyad axis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

In the original study using H4S47C-anchored cleavage, fragments were size-selected to be mostly 125\u2013200 bp, which resulted in very low coverage of individual centromeres (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brogaard et al., 2012b</a>). To avoid such size-related biases, we followed essentially the same protocol in generating cleavage products, but applied a modified Solexa paired-end DNA sequence library preparation protocol that does not include a size-selection step (<a href=\"#bib31\">Henikoff et al., 2011</a>). In both biological and technical replicates using several variations in the protocol (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we obtained virtually identical fragment length distributions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), indicating a high degree of repeatability and robustness in the basic cleavage mapping protocol. Centromere function is normal in the H4S47C mutant cell line, as we observed virtually identical doubling times of 90 min and a CEN plasmid retention rate of 99% per generation for the H4S47C strain (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

At the cell densities used in our experiments (\u223c1\u20132 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup>, blue arrow) both the parent strain (BY4741) and the mutant strain (H4S47C in a BY4741 background) doubled every 90 min and were 97\u201398% viable (<b>B</b>). (<b>C</b>) H4S47C mutant cells grow normally at elevated temperatures. We attribute the growth and temperature-sensitivity phenotypes previously reported for the H4S47C strain (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brogaard et al., 2012a</a>) to its failure to enter a quiescent state upon nutrient depletion. This failure results in cultures growing to higher densities, loss of viability &gt;1 day after reaching stationary phase, smaller colonies, and 8% larger cell volumes. The H4S47C strain shows 99% CEN plasmid retention compared to 99.99% plasmid retention for BY4741 in plasmid loss assays (<a href=\"#bib33\">Koshland et al., 1987</a>) (data not shown). This phenotypic syndrome is likely attributable to the replacement of the two histone H4 genes, <i>HHF1</i> and <i>HHF2</i> with a single mutant <i>HHF1</i> gene, resulting in reduced H4 dosage: Deleting <i>HHF2</i> causes reduced starvation resistance (<a href=\"#bib17\">Davey et al., 2012</a>), and partial histone depletion in general is associated with reduced longevity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Feser et al., 2010</a>)."

To test this possibility, we manually examined the region around the most frequently cleaved base pair on each chromosome (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,G,I,K</a>) but detected no double peak pattern similar to that seen over centromeres."

We scored alignments as the Pearson correlation (r) between the profile and the chromosome. For each chromosome, a centromere alignment to the profile (median r = 0.76) scored above the best non-centromere alignment (median r = 0.40) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Removing each centromere from the model and rescanning (\u2018delete-one jackknife\u2019) reduced their scores accordingly, but the median correlation (r = 0.52) still scored above the median correlation for the best non-centromeric alignment (r = 0.41).

However, at all 16 centromeres, we observed a strong bias against recovery of the right-end fragment for the cleavage cluster on the left (on the CDEI side of CDEII) and against recovery of the left-end fragment for the cleavage cluster on the right (on the CDEIII side of CDEII) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>). In contrast, there was no consistent recovery bias seen for the single peaks of the most frequently cleaved base pair on every chromosome when similarly aligned (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D</a>). We suspected that the presence of \u223c40 bp more of the &gt;90% AT-rich CDEII sequence on a fragment caused it to be strongly discriminated against during some step in the sequencing pipeline. Consistent with this possibility, we found that when fragments are aligned around the mid-Cen and mapped as normalized counts, in addition to the strong depletion directly over CDEII, there is a gradient of decreasing depletion with distance from the centromere (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, red line).

There are 46 segments in the budding yeast genome that are at least 90% AT-rich over 83-bp, the median length of CDEII, and all of them are under-represented relative to expectation in our cleavage datasets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Importantly, the degree of representation decreases significantly with increasing AT-richness between 90\u2013100% (r = 0.52), showing depletions similar to what is seen for CDEII-containing fragments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). We therefore attribute the preferential loss of CDEII-containing fragments to their AT-richness, and not to any other feature of centromeric DNA. We observed similar losses for a Solexa library produced using Phusion DNA Polymerase, which has been reported to bias against such strongly AT-rich sequences (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartfai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lopez-Barragan et al., 2010</a>), and libraries produced using KAPA DNA Polymerase, which has been engineered to be exceptionally processive on sequences that are strongly compositionally biased (<a href=\"#bib43\">Quail et al., 2012</a>). It is more likely that an inherent feature of the Illumina platform, such as PCR-based cluster generation, is responsible for discrimination against sequencing templates that are &gt;90% AT-rich (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartfai et al., 2010</a>)."

The high-resolution crystal structure of the cenH3 octasome shows an arrangement of H4 residues, including S47, that is virtually identical to that for the conventional H3 octasome (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tachiwana et al., 2011</a>), and so would predict a similar cleavage pattern over the centromere as is seen for highly occupied and phased nucleosomes genome-wide. This is clearly not the case at any yeast centromere, as even the minimal spacing of the inner cleavages is much larger than can be explained by our molecular dynamics model for a single nucleosome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) or is observed for highly occupied and phased H3 nucleosomes throughout the genome (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Likewise, Cse4/H3 octasomes and (Cse4/H4)<sub>2</sub> tetrasomes also predict the same mirror-image symmetrical arrangement of two H4s as canonical octasomes, and so our data also exclude those models. This leaves two other models, a version of the (Cse4/H4/Scm3)<sub>2</sub> particle and the hemisome, as potentially explaining the cleavage patterns that we observe. The presence of Scm3 as an integral part of the Cse4 nucleosome has been excluded based on subsequent in vivo mapping (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shivaraju et al., 2011</a>) and in vitro reconstitution studies (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cho and Harrison, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Xiao et al., 2011</a>), which leaves the hemisome as the only model that can account for the cleavage patterns that we observe. Specifically, a model in which independent hemisomes align around the mid-Cen position in either orientation and in two rotational phases can account for all of the cleavage peaks that we observe over centromeres."

This \u223c8-bp difference in cleavage pattern corresponds to the fact that, as pointed out above, Cen4 is 6\u20139 bp shorter than the other 15 centromeres. A parsimonious explanation of this correspondence is that the position of H4 residue 47 in the Cse4 core particle is fixed relative to the nearer junction regardless of whether the junction is CDEI-II or CDEII-III. Thus, cleavages on the left side of the mid-Cen position would preferentially occur a fixed distance from CDEI-II, whereas cleavages on the right side of the mid-Cen position would preferentially occur a fixed distance from the CDEII-III junction. In both cases, the 10-bp spacing between cleavage maxima implies that the rotational phase of the Cse4 nucleosome is established by where the nearer sequence-specific DNA-binding protein binds, whether it is Cbf1 at CDEI or the CBF3 complex at CDEIII."

At least one cleavage on the Watson strand and one on the Crick strand are required to observe a fragment by sequencing. Cu<sup>+</sup> attack on DNA results in base-loss, and we would observe the adjacent position when the cleaved products are sequenced after Solexa end-polishing. We took an unbiased approach and asked what are the preferred distances between left and right ends of fragments observed experimentally. The left end of a fragment marks the position of a cleavage and base loss on the Watson strand and the right end of a fragment marks the position of a cleavage and base loss on the Crick strand. The distances between left and right ends thus reflect preferred cleavage locations. We observed peaks at \u22122, +5 and +12 in the Watson-Crick (W-C) distributions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, red curve), which are all explained by the DNA positions shown to be accessible to H4S47C-phenanthroline-Cu<sup>+</sup> in our structural model (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, the structural model helps us distinguish between W-C peaks due to cleavages by H4S47C on one side of the dyad and W-C peaks due to cleavages on two H4S47Cs across the dyad. The +5 W-C peak results from cleavages by the same H4, whereas the \u22122 and +12 W-C peaks result from cleavages occurring on both sides of the dyad."

Whereas we observed a peak at +5, which can arise from the presence of a single H4, the peaks at \u22122 and +12, which require two H4s on either side of the dyad axis, were not seen. It might be argued that we do not observe \u22122 and +12 peaks in the W-C distributions near CDEII because of preferential loss of AT-rich fragments spanning CDEII (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). However, in that case, we would also not see the +5 peak, suggesting that the loss of \u22122 and +12 peaks is not due to an AT-rich sequencing bias. To verify this interpretation, we examined same-strand (W\u2013W\u2019 and C\u2013C\u2019) distributions, which obviates the need to recover fragments spanning CDEII. For the W\u2013W\u2019 and C\u2013C\u2019 distributions we again observed a strong peak at +1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>, black curves), which can arise from a single H4, whereas the peak at +7, which results from cleavage across a dyad axis, was absent. Rather, the 10-bp peak spacing evident in the centromere maps (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and attributable to rotational phasing was a prominent feature in both W\u2013W\u2019 and C\u2013C\u2019 for centromeres, but not genome-wide. Taken together, the absence of peaks representing H4S47C-anchored cleavages across the dyad axis but the presence of peaks representing a single H4 at centromeres provides independent confirmation based on mapping of cleavage positions that single H4-containing particles predominate at centromeres."

First, the two double vertical lines of dots seen on either side of the mid-Cen mark the location of two 10-bp cleavage pairs observed using conventional cleavage density histograms. Second, the fact that the vertical lines are densely populated up to \u223c400 bp excludes the possibility that the deficiency of the AT-rich mid-CDEII-containing fragments is attributable in part to being on average 40-bp longer than their sister fragments and so discriminated against based on size. Third, clusters of left and right fragments on either side of the centromere, representing neighboring nucleosomes, align closely with MNase-seq nucleosomal profiles for all 16 centromeres, and show centromere-to-centromere variability as previously observed (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cole et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Krassovsky et al., 2012</a>). Fourth, each left end must pair with a right end, and the fact that for each left-end vertical there is a corresponding dense right-end diagonal and vice-versa implies that there are dense cleavages on either side of the centromere in addition to those expected from cleavages centered over neighboring nucleosomes, a point that we will return to in the next section. Finally, when log<sub>2</sub>(Cse4/Input) ChIP-seq profiles are superimposed over the V-plots, we see that the midpoints of the vertical lines of dots marking the preferred cleavages are precisely centered over the position of maximum occupancy of the Cse4 nucleosome."

The cleavage frequency in a wild-type strain is too low to obtain a library comparable to that of the H4S47C strain, which requires that two cleavages are sufficiently close to generate &lt;500-bp fragments for paired-end sequencing. Therefore, purified DNA was cleaved to completion with AluI, which cleaves the sequence AG^CT and leaves blunt ends. The very low level of cleavages observed over centromeres (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) confirms that centromere cleavage patterns are specific for H4S47C and not for centromere-specific DNA-binding proteins. As an additional control, we identified background cleavages by isolating DNA from untreated cells and digesting with AluI before library preparation. This revealed that the level of background cleavage over centromeres is similarly low regardless of whether or not cells were subjected to OP-labeling and cleavage reactions, as expected if centromeres are fully occupied and protected during the cleavage reaction (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping relies on nucleosomes remaining stably wrapped during the multistep nuclear labeling and washing procedures, which includes an overnight incubation with OP-labeling reagent that is performed prior to the actual Cu-dependent cleavage reaction. Therefore, our mapping of Cse4 hemisomes over centromeres at levels expected for such high AT-rich sequences (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) implies that they are stable particles in vivo as we previously showed for hemisomes wrapped by CDEII in vitro (<a href=\"#bib24\">Furuyama et al., 2013</a>).

Using a gel-shift assay, we observed no changes in particle migration associated with the OP-labeling procedure for any of the reconstituted octasomes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). To confirm that the particles undergoing a gel-shift remained octasomes during this procedure, we gel-purified reconstituted particles with or without the OP-labeling treatment and performed atomic force microscopy (AFM). We found that OP-treated and untreated Cse4 and H3 octasomes are similar in height to one another but are \u223c40\u201350% taller than Cse4-H4S47C/CDEII hemisomes reconstituted and incubated in parallel (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib24\">Furuyama et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Codomo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Walkiewicz et al., 2014</a>).

In both cases, midpoint V-plots reveal that CDEI, CDEII and CDEIII are strongly MNase-protected relative to flanking regions in both strains with or without OP treatment in both soluble and insoluble chromatin fractions. This extent of Cse4 particle occupancy is half that necessary to accommodate two spaced hemisomes, because if the cleavage pairs were attributable to two hemisomes particles wrapping \u223c60 bp with spacings of 33\u201353 bp between cleavage sites, then the total span would be 153\u2013173 bp, or about twice the \u223c80 bp that the Cse4-containing particle occupies.

The best-studied fragile nucleosome is over the Gal4 UAS in the Gal1-10 regulatory region, when yeast are grown in glucose (<a href=\"#bib21\">Floer et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). We therefore expected to observe high frequency cleavage by this nucleosome in our cleavage datasets. However, there was no evidence of nucleosome-directed cleavage, but rather especially strong cleavage diagonals directly over the Gal4 UAS (UASg, <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). We observed similarly strong Xs over other fragile nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The \u2018X\u2019 pattern of depletion seen at these sites resembles that for known nucleosome depleted regions, such as those around binding sites for the Reb1 and Abf1 transcription factors (<a href=\"#fig7s5\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). We further confirmed this interpretation by mapping AluI-generated fragments of DNA in the Gal1-Gal10 region from wildtype cells subjected to OP-labeling and cleavage reactions. We observed a strong diagonal representing the left end of fragments cleaved by AluI at a site on the right side of the Gal4 UAS, but only weakly extending beyond the edge of the well-occupied next nucleosome to the left (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>). In contrast, centromeres showed very little cleavage relative to regions on either side (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), indicating protection from background cleavages and confirming that Cse4 nucleosome-directed cleavages depend on the H4S47C mutation. The stability of the Cse4 centromeric nucleosome and protection from background cleavages under these conditions confirm that Cse4 hemisomes are immobile at centromeres, as expected from the stability of Cse4 hemisomes on short DNA fragments, including a fragment consisting of CDEII alone (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Furuyama et al., 2013</a>)."

Using molecular dynamics simulation of H4S47C-anchored cleavages, and verification of the resulting model based on cleavage patterns at highly occupied and phased nucleosomes, we find that the pattern over all 16 centromeres, and the distance between cleavage sites, is profoundly different from what is seen elsewhere in the genome. As octasome and tetrasome structures for the Cse4 nucleosome position two H4S47 residues immediately on either side of the dyad axis, just as for conventional H3 octasomes and tetrasomes, our cleavage data rule out these structures as making a substantial contribution to Cse4 occupancy at centromeres (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Indeed, the only proposed structure that fits our data is a hemisome in one of four mutually exclusive orientations occupying each centromere within the population of cells. Thus, the Cse4 nucleosome shows remarkable rotational flexibility within the confines of the 78\u201386 bp CDEII sequence, where it can assume opposite orientations and two preferred rotational phasing patterns. Such flexibility might be important for brief hemisome\u2013octasome transitions reported for both budding yeast and human cenH3s (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bui et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shivaraju et al., 2012</a>)."

We attribute this rotational and reflectional flexibility to the fact that a 78-bp CDEII duplex is sufficient to stably wrap a hemisome in vitro (<a href=\"#bib24\">Furuyama et al., 2013</a>), and that AT-richness alone is sufficient for full in vivo function of CDEII, as some random 92% AT-rich sequences substituted for natural CDEII supported faithful segregation of mini-chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker and Rogers, 2005</a>). This interpretation helps to clarify the roles of Cbf1 and the CBF3 complex in maintaining centromeres. Both proteins tightly bend DNA and thus delimit an \u223c80-bp sequence for assembly of the Cse4 nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib29\">Henikoff and Furuyama, 2012</a>). CBF3 is essential for recruiting Cse4, where the Ndc10 subunit interacts with the Scm3 Cse4-specific chaperone (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shivaraju et al., 2011</a>). In addition, our findings suggest that Cbf1 acts as a barrier on the left that sets the sharp rotational positions of the Cse4 nucleosomes that are asymmetrically oriented with H4S47 closest to CDEI. This implied role of Cbf1 in Cse4 hemisome positioning is consistent with our previous analysis of MNase-seq data in a <i>cbf1\u0394</i> mutant strain showing that loss of Cbf1 is accompanied by a shift in position of the Cse4 nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib34\">Krassovsky et al., 2012</a>). The rotational and reflectional flexibility of the Cse4 nucleosome implied by our study argues against specific roles for either Cbf1 or CBF3 in orienting the histone core within the single DNA wrap (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xiao et al., 2011</a>)."

Complete replacement of the replication-coupled histone gene cluster has been accomplished in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gunesdogan et al., 2010</a>), and conceivably other strategies for introducing cysteine-substituted histones might be considered for other model organisms. The application of this technology to the study of cenH3 nucleosomes more generally has the potential of resolving current debates as to the generality of hemisomes vs octasomes at centromeres. Current evidence suggests that both types of particles are present in animal genomes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bui et al., 2012</a>), although which are at functional centromeres and which are on chromosome arms has been unclear. MNase-seq and ChIP-seq have been applied to the problem, but particle size has been ambiguous because of the inherent sensitivity of hemisomes to MNase digestion (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dalal et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Krassovsky et al., 2012</a>) and ambiguities caused by partial unwrapping of octasomes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tachiwana et al., 2011</a>) and internal cleavages and nibbling (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hasson et al., 2013</a>).

Without requested data, it is impossible to exclude the possibility that the distinctive chemical cleavage pattern at centromeres is an artifact of Cse4 octasome dissociation to hemisome under chemical cleavage conditions. That is why this control experiment is one of the essential three requested by reviewers. The known cold instability of Cse4 octasomes, as noted by authors, only underscores the importance of this control."

This centromere enrichment provides sufficient sequencing depth for near-base-pair resolution, and shows precise positioning and protection of the functional centromere. Similar midpoint V-plot patterns were obtained by native Cse4 ChIP-seq as described below in response to Point 4. We conclude that the H4S47C mutation and the long in vitro incubation have no effect on Cse4 positioning at the centromere."

PNAS 93:1370-75, 1996) does not really apply to our OP-Cu<sup>+</sup> experiments, as those authors derivatized H4S47C with a different compound, S-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)cysteaminyl EDTA, an iron chelator. Therefore, we now include sequencing data for canonical OP-labeled octasomes reconstituted onto 601 DNA (last paragraph of the Results section entitled \u201cA molecular dynamics model for H4S47C-anchored hydroxyl radical cleavage\u201d and new <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). The major cleavage peaks that we see for OP-Cu<sup>+</sup>-labeled 601 octasomes in vitro are among those predicted by our structural model and observed for octasomes in vivo. As the position of H4S47C relative to the surrounding residues and DNA is identical within experimental error when the H3 (1KX5) and Cse4 (3AN2) crystal structures are aligned, undoubtedly the same results would be obtained with Cse4 in place of H3 using 601 or other strongly positioning DNA. However, Cse4 octasomes reconstituted using native yeast centromeric DNA are unstable, presumably owing to the extreme AT-richness of CDEII. For example, a paper from J. Gerton, J. Workman and A. Shilatifard (Camahort et al. Mol Cell 35:794-805, 2009 PMID:19782029) stated: \u201cAll attempts to reconstitute Cse4 nucleosomes using a centromeric DNA sequence and salt dialysis failed (data not shown).\u201d Although K. Luger\u2019s group was successful in reconstituting Cse4 nucleosomes on 147-bp Cen3 DNA, they found that storage at 4 <sup>o</sup>C overnight caused them to dissociate (Dechassa et al. Nat. Communications 2:313, 2011 PMID: 21587230). As these are similar to the conditions that we use for the OP-labeling reaction, obtaining cleavage maps of Cse4 octamers on centromere-specific DNA is likely to be unfeasible."

To address this question, we have taken advantage of our recent success in assembling hemisomes on short DNA duplexes. We follow a standard salt dialysis protocol but the DNAs that we use are only 62-78 bp long. During dialysis from 2 M NaCl to low salt or 4 M urea, \u201cpseudo-octasomes\u201d split to form two hemisomes (Furuyama et al. NAR 41:5769-83, 2013 PMID: 23620291). To obtain homogeneous hemisomes necessary for this experiment, we have found that trypsinizing octameric cores to partially remove the tails prevents aggregation that otherwise occurs, and elution of the resulting gel-shifted band from a gel suffices to recover pure hemisomes as judged by re-electrophoresis and AFM (Codomo et al. NSMB, 21:4-5, 2014 PMID:24389542). Using this refined protocol, we have performed in vitro cleavage mapping on gel-purified hemisomes where one of the oligos in the duplex was labeled on the 5\u2019 end with Cy3 and on the 3\u2019 end with Alexa488, using the gelFRET signal between them when wrapped around the particle to confirm that the gel-shifted band consists of wrapped hemisomes (no FRET is observed for the unshifted control band \u2013 Codomo et al, op cit). We electrophoresed the reaction products on sequencing gels alongside Maxam-Gilbert ladders using the Cy3 and Alexa488 fluorophores as end labels, which allowed us to determine the migration of both fragments generated by cleavage in the same gel lane. We find that the strongest cleavage peaks approximately correspond to the left-hand preferred cleavage sites seen for Cen4 in vivo (Materials and Methods section \u201cIn vitro cleavage mapping\u201d new <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). This direct approach determines the positions of single-strand cleavages measured from both ends of the same strand, as opposed to recovery of only double-strand cleavage fragments after end-polishing and adapter ligation for NGS library preparation. As expected for the loss of a single base during the cleavage reaction, we see that there is one base position between the left fragment cleavage site and the estimated right fragment cleavage site, and we see this for both peaks on the left side of CDEII. This is the side where the strong pair of in vivo cleavages are seen for Cen4 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2</a>). Although only one clear peak is seen on the right side of Cen4 CDEII, the in vivo peaks on this side are weak. The fact that we are seeing the expected single-strand cleavages in vitro on hemisomes assembled on CDEII DNA confirms the predictions of our structural model."

To perform ChIP requires either a tag or an antibody, and we are concerned about using tagged proteins that might themselves destabilize the centromere, especially components of the essential CBF3 complex (Cbf1 is non-essential with only a mild segregation phenotype). However, we obtained a custom anti-rabbit Cse4 antibody from Sue Biggins that she had used for ordinary ChIP, which has allowed a direct comparison between the mutant and wild-type strains before and after the OP-labeling treatment without any tags. Using our previously published native ChIP procedure (\u201cORGANIC\u201d profiling \u2013 Krassovsky et al. PNAS 2012 and Kasinathan et al. Nat. Methods, 2013 PMID: 24336359) we obtained sufficient high-quality paired-end reads using the Biggins antibody to confirm the Cse4-associated occupancy of CDEI, CDEII and CDEIII implied by MNase-seq profiling. We observed no difference in Cse4 particle positioning regardless of whether or not nuclei were subjected to the OP-labeling treatment or whether the strain was mutant or wild-type (new Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 5). We conclude that neither the mutant nor the labeling treatment has a detectable effect on occupancy or positioning of centromere proteins."

(Meth Enz 2012): \u201cThe H4S47C/ura3 strain is viable but maintains a growth phenotype and is temperature sensitive\u201d. In response to the reasonable concerns raised by Reviewer 2, we have now more thoroughly investigated phenotypic differences between the H4S47C and its parent BY4741 strain. Most relevant to our study and that of Brogaard et al. (Nature 2012), we find that the H4S47C and BY4741 log growth rates are virtually superimposable with a 90 minute doubling time, and we now provide growth and viability measurements for the two strains (new <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1A-B</a>). Nevertheless, consistent differences are seen when cells are grown on plates (mutant colonies are smaller), when cells are inoculated into fresh culture medium (mutant cells take longer to recover), and when cells reach stationary phase (mutant cells grow to a higher density). Furthermore, mutant cells are \u223c8 % larger in diameter than wild-type cells, which suggests a failure of the strain to achieve a quiescent state upon nutrient deprivation (Linda Breeden, personal communication). For example, the uppermost cells in a colony become increasingly nutrient-deprived as the colony grows, limiting colony growth. Also, cells in liquid culture that fail to enter a quiescent state will not halt protein synthesis and stop dividing in time to prevent metabolic damage. To test this explanation, we extended the culture period, and found that the H4S47C strain showed a dramatic loss of viability (from \u223c95 % to \u223c60 %) about one day after reaching stationary phase, whereas the parent strain showed only a minor loss of viability (from \u223c95 % to \u223c90 %). This confirms that the phenotypes result from failure to enter a quiescent state upon nutrient deprivation. We also tested for temperature sensitivity in suspension, but found that the mutant cells if anything grew better than wild-type cells at 37<sup>o</sup>C in liquid culture (new <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1C</a>)."

Each <i>S. cerevisiae</i> histone is present in two copies encoding the same protein, and only one of the two H4 genes (HHF1 to Cys47) and was mutated while the other (HHF2) was replaced with a selectable marker (URA3). This is a routine strategy for mutating histones; for example, the Boeke lab replaced both HHF2 and HTF2 (histone H3 gene 1) to construct 486 single mutations in H3 and H4 (Dai et al. Cell 2008, PMID: 18805098), and as a result, a similar syndrome to what we are observing for H4S47C is a feature of histone mutations that is well-known to yeast chromatin researchers (S. Biggins, personal communication). HHF2 deletions, but not HHF1 deletions, cause reduced starvation resistance (Davey et al. Environ Microbiol 2012, PMID:22356628), which is consistent with the HHF2 deletion in the H4S47C mutant strain causing the phenotypic syndrome that we observe in this strain. Moreover reduced histone levels are associated with reduced life-span in yeast (Feser et al. Mol Cell, 2010, PMID:20832724). As our experiments were performed during early\u2013mid log-phase growth, these phenotypes are not relevant to our study."

Given that these plasmid loss measurements were made after cells had approached stationary phase, it is likely that the 1% plasmid loss in the mutant strain is related to the syndrome described above, not reduced centromere function.

(2011) <i>PNAS</i>; Shiveraju et al. (2012) <i>Cell</i>). However, nobody to our knowledge has ever produced stable hemisomes on 147-bp linear DNA, presumably because octasomes will outcompete hemisomes during reconstitution owing to having twice as many protein\u2013DNA contacts and having protein\u2013protein docking contacts between nucleosome halves. When these contacts are reduced, for example in 4 M urea + 300 mM NaCl, H2A/H2B dimers are released, leaving an (H3/H4)<sub>2</sub> tetrasome (Yamasu &amp; Senshu (1990) <i>J. Biochem</i>), as expected because the H2B/H4 4-helix bundles are weaker than the H3/H3 4-helix bundle. So although an octasome-to-hemisome transition might well occur in vivo, as has been proposed by others, it cannot be made to happen on 147-bp DNA. Even if it did, we would not expect to recover the products, much less map their cleavage patterns. It follows that cleavage mapping on 147-bp DNA can only result in an octasome pattern, and so this experiment will be uninformative with respect to a presumptive artifactual hemisome-to-octasome transition."

As Reviewer 2 pointed out, stable Cse4/Cen nucleosomes can be readily produced by salt dialysis, for example at higher temperature. We now realize that the observation we referred to in the rebuttal suggesting cold sensitivity was only Cen3 DNA assembled with Cse4 + Xenopus histone partners that disassembled upon storage (Figure S7 of Dechassa et al. 2011, Nat Comm). In fact, as Reviewer 2 pointed out, Cen3 with yeast histones remained intact upon storage in that study and others. We thank Reviewer 2 for correcting our erroneous suggestion that producing Cse4/Cen octasomes is likely to be unfeasible."

                    "text": "Fortunately, we can test the possibility of an octasome-to-hemisome transition with a simple and direct set of in vitro experiments. The objective is to confirm the MNase-mapping and ChIP in vivo experiments that we provided in the first round by showing that the long incubation needed for labeling does not disrupt a Cse4 octasome in vitro. To do this we cannot use the in vitro cleavage protocol that we used in and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2</a>, because there we had labeled the histone octamers before assembling octasomes or hemisomes. Rather, we need to first assemble octasomes, subject them to the OP labeling procedure and then show that the octasomes remain intact. We have now performed this test. We assembled H3/601, H3/Cen3, Cse4-H4S47C/601 and Cse4-H4S47C/Cen3 octasomes using lightly trypsinized cores to avoid aggregation that otherwise occurs in the 1 M sorbitol-containing OP labeling buffer (data not shown). We used our recently published gel-shift protocol (Codomo et al. (2014) <i>NSMB</i> PMID:24389542) both to extract the octasome band into labeling buffer and to assay for possible breakdown after DMSO-OP treatment. The results are shown in the new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A-B</a> and referred to in the second paragraoh of the Results section entitled \u201cCse4 hemisomes are stable at centromeres\u201d. In all cases, the gel shift after overnight OP incubation was virtually identical between treated and untreated samples, with no evidence of new bands appearing as a result of either gel purification in labeling buffer or incubation with DMSO-OP. We confirmed this conclusion directly on single particles using AFM imaging: both H3-H4/Cen3 and Cse4-H4S47C/Cen3 particles were of octameric height whether or not they were subjected to a long OP incubation, using a Cse4-H4S47C/CDEII hemisome control assembled in parallel, which also remained intact during the labeling reaction. These experiments provide direct in vitro support for our conclusion based on native MNase and ChIP mapping that the labeling treatment could not have caused a transition from octasomes to hemisomes, hexasomes or tetrasomes. To highlight the fact that both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate the stability of particles to the OP-labeling treatment, the new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> also includes the native MNase-seq data (now <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, previously Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 3)."
