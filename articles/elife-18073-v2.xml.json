One of these has a higher probability of reward than the other three, and individuals soon begin to favor this target over the others. If the identity of the most rewarded target changes, individuals adjust their responses accordingly.

In particular, we show that while the cascade model of synapses is able to consolidate reward information in a stable environment, it is severely limited in its ability to adapt to a sudden change in the environment. The addition of a surprise detection system, which is able to detect such abrupt changes, facilitates adaptation by enhancing the synaptic plasticity of the decision-making network.

One is a concurrent variable interval (VI) schedule, where rewards are given stochastically according to fixed contingencies.

We therefore assume that the goal of subjects in this case is to implement the matching law, which has previously been shown to be produced by the model under study (<a href=\"#bib59\">Soltani and Wang, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fusi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wang, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Iigaya and Fusi, 2013</a>). The other schedule is a variable rate (VR) schedule, also known as a multi-armed bandit task, where the probability of obtaining a reward is fixed for each choice. In this case, subjects need to figure out which choice currently has the highest probability of rewards.

The synapses projecting from the input population to the winning target population are potentiated stochastically with probability <math id=\"inf13\"><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>r</mi></msub></math> in case of a reward, while they are depressed stochastically with probability <math id=\"inf14\"><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></msub></math> in case of no-reward (for simplicity we assume <math id=\"inf15\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>r</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow></math>, otherwise explicitly noted). These transition probabilities are closely related to the plasticity of synapses, as a synapse with a larger transition probability is more vulnerable to changes in strength. Thus, we call <math id=\"inf16\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></math>\u2019s the rate of plasticity.

Also, learning was slower with shorter ISIs, which is consistent with findings in <a href=\"#bib37\">Mazur (1996)</a>. This is because the cascade model makes metaplastic transitions to deeper states (memory consolidation) during stable session 1, and those synapses are less likely to be modified in later sessions, remaining as a bias. However, they could be reset during each ISI due to forgetting transitions (Figure 7), the chance of which is higher with a longer ISI."

Crucially, however, not all synapses become plastic during the ISIs, leading to a persistent bias toward the previous preference. Our model in fact predicts such a bias can develop over multiple sessions, and this is supported by experimental data (<a href=\"#bib27\">Iigaya et al., 2013</a>). We plan to present this formally elsewhere.

The first was by Mackintosh (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mackintosh, 1975</a>), in which he proposed that learning should be enhanced if a stimulus predicts rewards. In other words, a reward-irrelevant stimulus should be ignored, while a reward-predictive stimulus should continue to be attended to. This can be interpreted in our model in terms of formations of stimulus-selective neural populations in the decision making circuit. In other words, such a process would be equated with a shaping of the network architecture itself. This modification is beyond the scope of the current work, and we leave it as future work. The other influential proposal was made by Pearce and Hall (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pearce and Hall, 1980</a>). They proposed that learning rates should be increased when an outcome was unexpected. This indeed is at the heart of the model proposed here, where unexpected uncertainty enhanced synaptic plasticity and hence the learning rate. Since the Pearce-Hall model focused on the algorithmic level of computation while our work focusing more on neural implementation level of computation, our work complements the classical model of Pearce and Hall (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pearce and Hall, 1980</a>). We should, however, stress again that how our surprise detection system can be implemented should still be determined in the future."

These models, however, provided limited insight into how the algorithms can be implemented in neural circuits. To fill this gap, we proposed a computation which is partially performed by bounded synapses, and we found that our model performs as well as a Bayesian learner model (<a href=\"#bib6\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>). We should, however, note that we did not specify a network architecture for our surprise detection system. A detailed architecture for this, including connectivity between neuronal populations, requires more experimental evidence. For example, how the difference in reward rates (subtraction) were computed in the network needs to be further explored theoretically and experimentally. One possibility is a network that includes two neural populations (X and Y), each of whose activity is proportional to its synaptic weights. Then one way to perform subtraction between these populations would be to have a readout population that receives an inhibitory projection from one population (X) and an excitatory projection from the other population (Y). The activity of the readout neurons would then reflect the subtraction of signals that are proportional to synaptic weights (Y\u2013X)."

Here we showed that this computation can be carried out mainly by synaptic plasticity. We also related our computation to the notions of unexpected and expected uncertainties, which have been suggested to be correlated with NE and Acetylcholine (Ach) release, respectively (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yu and Dayan, 2005</a>). In fact, there is increasing evidence that the activity of ACC relates to the volatility of the environment (<a href=\"#bib6\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>) or surprise signal (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hayden et al., 2011</a>). Also, there is a large amount of experimental evidence that Ach can enhance synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gordon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mitsushima et al., 2013</a>). This could imply that our surprise signal could be expressed as the balance between Ach and NE. On the other hand, in relation to encoding reward history over multiple timescales, it is well known that the phasic activity of dopaminergic neurons reflects a reward prediction error (<a href=\"#bib57\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>), while tonic dopamine levels may reflect reward rates (<a href=\"#bib43\">Niv et al., 2007</a>); these signals could also play crucial roles in our multiple timescales of reward integration process. We also note that a similar algorithm for the surprise detection was recently suggested in a reduced Bayesian framework (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wilson et al., 2013</a>)."

However, there are other cases where surprise signals could be sent to modify the rates of plasticity. For example, when the incoming reward rate is dramatically increased, surprise signals could enhance the metaplastic transitions so that the memory of recent action values are rapidly consolidated. Also, in response to an unexpected punishment rather than reward, surprise signals could be sent to enhance the metaplastic transitions to achieve a one-shot memory (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schafe et al., 2001</a>). Furthermore, the effect of the surprise signal may not be limited to reward-based learning. An unexpected recall of episodic memory could itself also trigger a surprise signal. This may explain some aspects of memory reconsolidation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schafe et al., 2001</a>)."

First, we mainly focused on a relatively simple decision making task, where one of the targets is more rewarding than the other and the reward rates for targets change at the same time. In reality, however, it is also possible that reward rates of different targets change independently. In this case it would be preferable to selectively change learning rates for different targets, which might be solved by incorporating an additional mechanism such as synaptic tagging (<a href=\"#bib9\">Clopath et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barrett et al., 2009</a>). Second, although we assumed that the surprise signal would reset most of the accumulated evidence when reward-harvesting performance deteriorates, in many cases it would be better to keep accumulated evidence, such as to form distinct \u2019contexts\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gershman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lloyd and Leslie, 2013</a>). This would allow subjects to access it later. This type of operation may require further neural populations to be added to the decision making circuit that we studied. In fact, it has been shown that introducing neurons that are randomly connected to neurons in the decision making network can solve context dependent decision-making tasks (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rigotti et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barak et al., 2013</a>). Those randomly connected neurons were reported in the prefrontal cortex\u00a0(PFC) as \u2018mixed-selective\u2019 neurons (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rigotti et al., 2013</a>).

Indeed, it has recently been shown that such a partitioning could also be advantageous general memory performance (<a href=\"#bib52\">Roxin and Fusi, 2013</a>), and this could be incorporated with relative ease into our model. One possibility is that the value signals computed by the cascade model synapses with a different range of timescales in distinct brain areas are combined to make decisions, so that the surprise signal is sent to the appropriate brain areas with the targeted rates of plasticity and contexts."

One is that the synapses encoding action values in the decision making network should change the level of plasticity itself. In other words, those synapses that reach the boundary of synaptic strength should become more resilient to change. For example, if rewards are given every trial from the same target, the synaptic strength targeting such target would reach the boundary, say after 100 trials. This means that the synaptic strength would remain the same, even after 1000 trials. However, the synapses after 1000 trials should be more resilient to change than synapse after 100 trials. Equally, the synapses that encode overall reward rates, or subject\u2019s performance, in a surprise detection system should not make meta-plastic transitions. Thus, studying the nature of synaptic plasticity may allow us to dissociate the functions of circuits."

Accordingly, synapses in population <math id=\"inf145\"><mi>i</mi></math> have the plasticity rate of <math id=\"inf146\"><msubsup><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi></msubsup></math>, which is the same rate as the cascade model\u2019s transition rate at the <math id=\"inf147\"><mi>i</mi></math>\u2019th level. Crucially, we assume these synapses are not meta-plastic. They simply undergo reward-dependent stochastic learning; but importantly, this time they do so independent of a chosen action so that the system can keep track of overall performance."

This makes sense because the timescale of block change was 100 trial, which is similar to the timescale of <math id=\"inf198\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></math>:\u00a0<math id=\"inf199\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mrow><mo>/</mo></mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>25</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> trials. Thus the timescale of <math id=\"inf200\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> was too short to detect this change: <math id=\"inf201\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mrow><mo>/</mo></mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>25</mn></mrow></mstyle></math> trials. Thanks to the surprise signals, the cascade model of synapses were able to adapt to the sudden changes in contingency (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). As a result, the choice probability also adapt to the environment (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>)."

Specifically, one important proposal is the \"surprise detection system\" which takes the difference between the current and expected uncertainty, with uncertainty defined as the range of fluctuation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). To compute this, the author proposes to calculate the difference in synaptic weights of two groups. This is a very interesting idea yet it is unclear how a neural circuit computes the difference in synaptic weights. One reviewer thought that precisely computing the difference of synaptic weights is beyond the ability of neural circuits (or \"out of biological constraints\"). We would like you to address this point either by showing how such a computation can be performed or approximated while obeying biological constraints or by simply further de-emphasizing the claim for implementation on specific parts although we note that you already state explicitly that network architecture of the surprise detection system is not specified in the present study, and that the efforts toward biophysical implementation is an important aspect of the present study overall."

In fact, I doubt the biological plausibility of the cascade model itself even though the cascade model is unique and provides interesting computational functions. The cascade model assumes binary states to avoid unbounded growth of synaptic strength. However, results from various cortical areas have revealed long-tailed or skewed distributions for the strength of cortical synapses (e.g., Song et al., PLoS Biol 2005; Buzsaki and Mizuseki, Nat Rev Neurosci 2014). These results do not seem to be consistent with binary synapses having only a depressed and a potentiated state. Though the long-tailed distributions contain very strong synapses, these synapses only constitute a small fraction of several thousands of synapses a cortical neuron receives, meaning that the fraction of synapses in the potentiated states should be much smaller than that of synapses in the depressed states. However, it is unclear whether the cascade model, or multi-timescale plasticity, also works under such constraint."

For instance, no neuron model is specified in the method section, and a (somewhat unspecific) network model is only referenced in the main text. I'd be completely fine with a learning model on a purely phenomenological level. However, if the author wants to emphasize that this type of learning occurs at the level of synapses, he should make the model more biophysical, e.g., by introducing a specific neuron and network model etc. The biophysical plausibility is particularly stretched in equation (24) which learns 'differences' between synaptic weights. I am fine with the learning rules per se, but talking about them in terms of networks and synapses seems a stretch. So either really show that this works within a network, or de-emphasize the biophysical interpretation."

The author states that longer time scales could remain stable, but it seems to me that does not exactly solve problem of switching between environments each of which changes on a faster time scale. This kind of context-dependence may be worth discussing."

Some years ago, the cascade synapse model successfully modeled the multi-timescale dynamics of synaptic plasticity for decision-making. However, as the overall learning performance gradually shifts to slower timescales in a stationary environment, the cascade synapse model has a difficulty in adapting sudden changes in the environment. To overcome this difficulty, the author proposes a \"surprise\" detection system for decision-making. The basic idea is to compare the reward information stored in plastic synapses on multiple timescales to detect change points in the environment. Since pieces of evidence suggest that such a signal exists in the brain, the idea and results are of potential interest.
