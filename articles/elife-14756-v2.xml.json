However, no synergistic effects of CTX and ACT on the spatio-temporal dynamics of immunocytes in vivo have been described. Here, we visualized key cell events in immunotherapy-elicited immunoreactions in a multicolor-coded tumor microenvironment, and then established an optimal strategy of metronomic combined-immunotherapy to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. Intravital imaging data indicated that regulatory T cells formed an 'immunosuppressive ring' around a solid tumor. The CTX-ACT combined-treatment elicited synergistic immunoreactions in tumor areas, which included relieving the immune suppression, triggering the transient activation of endogenous tumor-infiltrating immunocytes, increasing the accumulation of adoptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and accelerating the infiltration of dendritic cells. These insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of immunocytes are beneficial for optimizing immunotherapy and provide new approaches for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the involvement of immunocytes in cancer immunotherapy."

However, no synergistic effects of CTX and ACT on the spatio-temporal dynamics of immunocytes in vivo have been described. Here, we visualized key cell events in immunotherapy-elicited immunoreactions in a multicolor-coded tumor microenvironment, and then established an optimal strategy of metronomic combined-immunotherapy to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. Intravital imaging data indicated that regulatory T cells formed an 'immunosuppressive ring' around a solid tumor. The CTX-ACT combined-treatment elicited synergistic immunoreactions in tumor areas, which included relieving the immune suppression, triggering the transient activation of endogenous tumor-infiltrating immunocytes, increasing the accumulation of adoptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and accelerating the infiltration of dendritic cells. These insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of immunocytes are beneficial for optimizing immunotherapy and provide new approaches for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the involvement of immunocytes in cancer immunotherapy."

Current promising techniques in cancer immunotherapy are the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), tumor vaccines, and adoptive cell therapy (ACT) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Elert, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Couzin-Frankel\u00a0and\u00a0McNutt, 2013</a>). ACT has been reported to be one of the most efficient treatments for patients with melanoma because it effectively elicits anti-tumor immune responses and leads to objective tumor regression in more than 50% of patients (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pittet et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rosenberg et al., 2008</a>). During the immunotherapy-elicited immune response, various immune cells, including endogenous and adoptive immunocytes, are activated in the tumor microenvironment (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schreiber et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gajewski et al., 2013</a>). However, the underlying process remains a \u2018black box\u2019 because, whereas information is available to\u00a0describe the input (immunotherapy) and the output (tumor elimination), relatively limited information is available to\u00a0describe the spatio-temporal changes in the participating immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krummel, 2010</a>). Traditional biological methods, such as immunohistochemistry methods or flow cytometry, have revealed the type and function of immune cells that play a role at certain time-points during the anti-tumor reaction (<a href=\"#bib42\">Perentes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Boissonnas et al., 2013</a>). Visualization of the dynamic characteristics of immunocytes, including their movement, migration, and recruitment, as well as of\u00a0the interaction between immunocytes and tumor cells in the systemic environment, is critical for understanding the success or failure of cancer immunotherapy on a mechanistic level (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krummel, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bourzac, 2013</a>)."

The activity and cytotoxicity of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have long been considered the crucial factors for the efficacy of ACT against solid tumors (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boon, 1994</a>). However, recent reports have indicated that despite the detection of tumor-reactive CTLs in the bloodstream after the adoptive transfer, most CTLs lost\u00a0their anti-tumor functions as a result of endogenous immunosuppressive networks in the tumor microenvironment (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zippelius et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baitsch et al., 2011</a>). Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key immunosuppressive role in the endogenous immunosuppressive networks (<a href=\"#bib19\">Curiel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Vignali et al., 2008</a>). Various immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with Tregs have been revealed, including their specific recruitment and accumulation in the tumor stroma (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nishikawa and Sakaguchi, 2014</a>), suppression of the CTL function by TGF-\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2005</a>), and induction of the CTL dysfunction by interactions of Tregs with intratumoral dendritic\u00a0cells\u00a0(DCs) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bauer et al., 2014</a>). However, the details of the spatio-temporal orchestration of Tregs associated with tumor progression, the contributions of the Treg distribution in tumor stroma to immunosuppressive networks, and the effect of Tregs on the infiltration of adoptive CTLs into solid tumors remain unclear."

Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is a commonly used alkylating agent in chemotherapy, which has been applied in recent years to selectively suppress, abrogate and deplete Tregs before ACT treatment (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rosenberg et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nishikawa and Sakaguchi, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Oleinika et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhao et al., 2010</a>).

The migratory behavior of effector T cells in solid tumors has been analyzed by two-photon microscopy, proving that migration presents the critical step for the sufficient infiltration of T cells into the solid tumor and promotes tumor elimination (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mrass et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boissonnas et al., 2007</a>).

Although certain immunomodulatory functions of CTX alone or in\u00a0combination with immunotherapy have been proposed\u00a0previously, the synergistically enhanced effects of the combined CTX and ACT (CTX-ACT) treatment on the adoptive and endogenous anti-tumor immunoreactions have not been revealed. In particular, the dynamic effects of the CTX-ACT treatment on endogenous immune cells (such\u00a0as\u00a0CTLs, neutrophils and DCs) in the tumor microenvironment have not been well described. Using intravital microscopy and a skin-fold window chamber model, we captured a long-term comprehensive sequence of cellular events associated with multicolor-coded tumor cells, adoptive CTLs, endogenous CTLs, Tregs, DCs and tumor-infiltrating immunocytes in the tumor microenvironment during CTX-ACT combined-immunotherapy for B16 melanoma. The long-term intravital imaging data provided direct evidence for the synergetic anti-tumor immune-enhanced effects of the CTX-ACT combination treatment, including the elimination of Tregs, activation of the endogenous tumor-infiltrating immunocytes, and infiltration of adoptive and endogenous CTLs and DCs."

This CTX dose was selected on the basis of CFP-B16 tumor inhibition experiments with different CTX doses in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice and immune-deficient BALB/c nude mice. The results of these experiments showed that, compared with other CTX doses (50 mg kg<sup>\u22121</sup> and 100 mg kg<sup>\u22121</sup>) usually used in tumor immunotherapy, only the dose of 150 mg kg<sup>\u22121</sup> CTX controlled the CFP-B16 tumor growth successfully when CTX was\u00a0used alone as well as when it was used in combination with ACT (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, a tumor growth inhibition experiment performed on the BALB/c nude mice, confirmed that the effective anti-tumor effect of CTX at the dose of 150 mg kg<sup>\u22121</sup> is not due to its direct cytotoxicity, because no difference in the inhibition of tumor growth was observed between the PBS control group and the mice treated with different doses of CTX (50, 100\u00a0or 150 mg kg<sup>\u22121</sup>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

These imaging results were further confirmed by immunohistochemical staining using the anti-Foxp3 antibody (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, right panel).

These images showed that in the combined treatment, few adoptive CTLs infiltrated into the tumor microenvironment during the early stage (Days 1\u20133). Subsequently, the accumulation of CTLs increased significantly during the late stage (Days 4\u20136, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). By contrast, mRFP-Tregs were rarely observed regardless of the respective stage (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The elimination of Tregs and the\u00a0infiltration of CTLs resulted in large-scale tumor death consisting of tumors 'shrinking' from the outside and 'melting' from the inside (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, Days 5\u20136). This finding suggested that the infiltrating CTLs destroyed the solid tumor by applying two approaches: attacking the tumor cells at the periphery according to an 'outside-in' pattern and eliminating tumor cells at the parenchyma according to an 'inside-out' pattern. The anti-tumor effect of the adoptive CTLs peaked at Days 5\u20136. One day later (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, Day 7), the number of adoptive CTLs decreased rapidly in the tumor area because of the death or dysfunction of CTLs,\u00a0leading to tumor regrowth."

The data showed that the endogenous GFP cells in the tumors decreased after CTX-ACT treatment (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

The mean displacement of the TIIs on different days was consistent with random walking (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Thus, a transient increase in the motility of the endogenous TIIs was induced within 24 hr after the CTX-ACT treatment. These findings indicate that Day 1 is a key point in time for the activation of endogenous anti-tumor immune reactions in response to the CTX-ACT combined treatment. We speculated that the tumor destruction was caused by both adoptive CTLs and endogenous TIIs."

To investigate whether the CTX-ACT treatment accelerated the infiltration of DCs into the tumors, we observed the tumor microenvironment using large-field microscopy.

To improve the anti-tumor efficacy of the combined immunotherapy, we adopted three rounds of CTX-ACT treatment using a metronomic schedule (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). According to the intravital imaging data, the motility of the adoptive CTLs remained at a high level on Day 5 both\u00a0at the tumor periphery and in\u00a0the\u00a0parenchyma (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>).

Before the adoptive CTLs were recruited and activated, the motility of the endogenous TIIs transiently\u00a0increased on Day 1 and then the TIIs efficiently infiltrated into the tumor parenchyma (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). According to these results, an effective interval time of five days between treatment rounds was determined for the CTX-ACT combined therapy.

This approach maintained a specific immune reaction against CFP-B16 tumors in vivo at high levels.

Tregs are considered to play a crucial role in mediating immunosuppression in anti-tumor immune responses (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zou, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Beyer and Schultze, 2006</a>). By using large-field intravital imaging, we observed that Tregs not only concentrated at the tumor periphery (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) but also formed an immunosuppressive ring around a solid tumor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>), and adoptive CTLs barely infiltrated solid tumors in the presence of this immunosuppressive ring (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C, D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). CTLs must recognize the cognate antigen of tumor cells before they are able to infiltrate into the tumor parenchyma\u00a0sufficiently\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Boissonnas et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mrass et al., 2006</a>). Thus, we propose that the immunosuppressive ring of Tregs blocked the ability of adoptive CTLs to recognize the cognate antigen of tumor cells and decreased the migration of these CTLs into the tumor area. This conclusion is supported by the increased number of adoptive CTLs infiltrating into the tumor parenchyma after the CTX treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>), which depleted most of the Tregs in the tumor area and blocked the formation of an immunosuppressive ring around the solid tumor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Additionally, the depletion of the Tregs induced by CTX treatment contributed to the accumulation of adoptive CTLs in the tumor area in\u00a0three ways: (1) it cleared the immunosuppressive barrier to facilitate the migration of adoptive CTLs into the tumor area; (2) it induced the elevated expression of some chemokines and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment to promote the accumulation of adoptive CTLs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bracci et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schiavoni et al., 2011</a>); and (3) it provided space to allow the infiltration and homeostatic proliferation of adoptive CTLs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bracci et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sistigu et al., 2011</a>)."

In addition, adoptive CTLs accumulated at the tumor periphery, arrested in the tumor parenchyma to contact neighboring tumor cells on Day 3 and then resumed their high-speed migration on Day 5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C and F</a>). On Day 5, the anti-tumor effect elicited synergistically\u00a0by CTX\u00a0and\u00a0ACT in\u00a0a\u00a0combined treatment achieved its maximum and promoted external and internal tumor shrinking and melting (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>). Our results highlight the importance of metronomic treatments in CTX-ACT therapy, as a designed metronomic CTX-ACT treatment schedule (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) alternately accelerates the endogenous and adoptive anti-tumor immune responses and successfully controls the tumor growth for a long duration (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>)."

Certain researchers have indicated that T cells need to arrest for a long period at the tumor periphery and that their\u00a0interaction with tumor cells is crucial for tumor elimination (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boissonnas et al., 2007</a>). However, other studies have shown that the random, high speed migration of lymphocytes from the tumor periphery to the tumor center is beneficial for tumor elimination (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mrass et al., 2006</a>). In our study, we observed four different stages of\u00a0adoptive CTL\u00a0migration in the same tumor region, which occurred during the tumor destruction process over a period of up to seven days after the CTX-ACT combined treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A, C</a>, and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media4\">4</a>). The adoptive CTLs accumulated at the tumor periphery but barely infiltrated into the tumor parenchyma during the first stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-D</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Then, the CTLs formed a long-term interaction with the tumor cells in both the tumor periphery and the tumor parenchyma during the second stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-D</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Simultaneously with tumor cell death and elimination, the adoptive CTLs resumed their motility during the third stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-D</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Finally, the number and motility of the CTLs rapidly decreased, suggesting CTL dysfunction during the fourth stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-D</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Thus, the differences in the behavior of the adoptive CTLs throughout the four stages provide an explanation for the variations observed in the previous reports. Besides the activities of the adoptive CTLs, the dynamic behavior of endogenous CTLs has also been observed in our study. The CTX-ACT combined treatment depleted most of the endogenous T cells in the tumor area, and most of the remaining endogenous T cells were activated CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). While the adoptive CTLs had complex migratory behaviors during\u00a0the four different stages, the endogenous CTLs arrested at the tumor area for a long time and\u00a0showed confined movement so\u00a0that\u00a0they formed stable interactions with tumor cells and then effectively destroyed them (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C\u2013F</a>)."

                        "text": "In recent years, the interest in tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) has increased, and accumulating data have demonstrated that TANs play dichotomous roles because they exhibit both pro-tumor and anti-tumor effects during tumor progression (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mantovani et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Piccard et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Brandau et al., 2013</a>). Previous studies have demonstrated that during the early stage of tumor progression, accumulating TANs with high motility ((<a href=\"#bib62\">Yao et al., 2015</a>), also described as TENs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Granot et al., 2011</a>)), play an important role in the anti-tumor response by exerting a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hicks et al., 2006</a>), enhancing antibody-induced anti-tumor effects (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albanesi et al., 2013</a>), and having a stimulatory effect on T cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Eruslanov et al., 2014</a>). In the present study, more than 50% of the TIIs were neutrophils at a very early stage (Day 1) after the CTX-ACT treatment (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and exhibited a high motility. Thus, we assumed that these neutrophils were TENs with anti-tumor effects. After the CTX-ACT combined treatment, the endogenous TENs transiently moved (within\u00a024\u00a0hr)\u00a0with high speed via chemotaxis toward the tumor parenchyma (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>), and their motility increased before the accumulation of adoptive CTLs and DCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7A</a>). Intravital imaging showed that the number of DCs increased significantly on Day 3 after the CTX-ACT treatment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Some DCs displayed mature phenotypes in the tumor tissues of CTX-ACT-treated mice and presented high MHC-II and CD86 expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). A large number of DCs infiltrating into the tumor parenchyma has been shown to have a positive association with longer survival of cancer patients (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chaput et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pag\u00e8s et al., 2010</a>). Notably, the recruitment of DCs into the tumor area occurred earlier than the solid tumor \u2018melting\u2019 from the inside. This phenomenon suggests that the infiltrated DCs may take\u00a0up tumor antigens and present them to T cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Restifo et al., 2012</a>) to further elicit the anti-tumor immune response."

Thus, the K<sup>b</sup>-OVA antigen tumor model could not completely mimic the clinical presentation.

The CTX-ACT treatment not only promoted the anti-tumor effects of adoptive CTLs but also elicited endogenous anti-tumor immune responses. Guided by the results obtained by intravital imaging, three rounds of metronomic CTX-ACT treatments successfully controlled the tumor growth for several weeks. Thus, our long-term intravital imaging of the multicolor-coded tumor microenvironment provides new perspectives regarding the cellular mechanisms underlying the success or failure of cancer immunotherapies,and will facilitate improvements in the efficacy of combination immunotherapy. Furthermore, the method of long-term intravital imaging of various immune cells in the tumor microenvironment in vivo is also suitable for monitoring multiple immune reactions, studying the spatio-temporal cellular events of other immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors (CTLA-4 antibody and PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies), and comparing the efficacy of classical immunotherapies (such as the CTX-ACT combined treatment) and checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of different tumor models."

For the window chamber surgery, the mice were anesthetized by i.p. injecting a mix of ketamine (100 mg kg<sup>\u22121</sup>, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) and xylazine (10 mg kg<sup>\u22121</sup>, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) and positioned on a warmer plate at 37\u00b0C (Thermo Plate, TOKAI HIT, Shizuoka-ken, Japan). The skin on the back of the mice was sterilized with 70% alcohol and iodine solution. Titanium window frames (APJ Trading Co., Inc., Ventura, CA) were implanted onto the back of the mouse, and then, a hole with a diameter of 1 cm was dissected by removing the skin and fascia on one side of the dorsal skin-fold flap while maintaining the integrity of the opposing dermis, fascial plane and vasculature. One day later, CFP-B16 tumor cells (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup> resuspended in 25 \u03bcL PBS) were injected at one site near the major vessel and between the fascia and dermis of the rear skin.

The dose of cyclophosphamide (CTX) was the first thing we considered for designing the CTX-ACT combined treatment for CFP-B16 tumors.

In different mouse tumor models, effective CTX doses between 50 and 150 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> were applied for enhancing anti-tumor immune effects (Machiels et al. 2001, Le and Jaffee 2012), while a CTX dose range between 100 and 250 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> was used in B16 melanoma chemoimmunotherapy (Sistigu et al. 2011)."

These experiments confirmed that the anti-tumor effect of the CTX treatment with CTX doses between 50 and 150 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup> is not caused by the direct cytotoxicity of CTX, as no difference in the inhibition of tumor growth in immune-deficient mice (nude) was observed between the PBS control group and mice treated with different doses of CTX (50, 100, and 150 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). In immune-competent mice (C57BL/6), the CFP-B16 tumor growth was significantly inhibited by treatment with 150 mg kg<sup>\u20131</sup> CTX with or without adoptive T cells (ACT) in comparison to treatment with lower CTX doses of 50 and 100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> with or without ACT as well as PBS control groups.

It is hard to understand why only CTX-ACT, but neither CTX nor ACT treatment alone, induces this. Is it because those endogenous cells recognized something on the adoptively transferred CTLs or the transferred cells produced some factors to activate endogenous cells or promote their migration?</i>"

According to the intravital imaging data (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a>,<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>), the synergistic effect of CTX and ACT treatments contributes to trigger the transiently increased chemotactic movement of TIIs toward the tumor parenchyma. The CTX treatment relieved the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the tumor, and promoted the expression of many cytokines (such as GM-CSF and IL-1\u03b2)(Bracci et al. 2007) to prime (Yao et al. 2015) the neutrophils and recruit the mature neutrophils into the tumor area. On the other hand, few adoptive CTLs infiltrated into the tumor area as early as 24 h after the ACT treatment; some adoptive CTLs killed tumor cells partially and also released some inflammatory cytokines to further promote the infiltration of endogenous neutrophils. According to the previous reports, the mature neutrophils exhibited high motility and efficient anti-tumor effects (Fridlender et al. 2009, Piccard, Muschel, and Opdenakker 2012, Sagiv et al. 2015). We think that this phenomenon observed by intravital imaging is worth further studies."
