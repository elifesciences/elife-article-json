We developed a Bayesian model using data from 102 national surveys, triangulated against delivery data and distribution reports, to generate year-by-year estimates of four ITN coverage indicators. We explored the impact of two potential 'inefficiencies': uneven net distribution among households and rapid rates of net loss from households. We estimated that, in 2013, 21% (17%\u201326%) of ITNs were over-allocated and this has worsened over time as overall net provision has increased. We estimated that rates of ITN loss from households are more rapid than previously thought, with 50% lost after 23 (20\u201328) months. We predict that the current estimate of 920 million additional ITNs required to achieve universal coverage would in reality yield a lower level of coverage (77% population access). By improving efficiency, however, the 920 million ITNs could yield population access as high as 95%."

We developed a Bayesian model using data from 102 national surveys, triangulated against delivery data and distribution reports, to generate year-by-year estimates of four ITN coverage indicators. We explored the impact of two potential 'inefficiencies': uneven net distribution among households and rapid rates of net loss from households. We estimated that, in 2013, 21% (17%\u201326%) of ITNs were over-allocated and this has worsened over time as overall net provision has increased. We estimated that rates of ITN loss from households are more rapid than previously thought, with 50% lost after 23 (20\u201328) months. We predict that the current estimate of 920 million additional ITNs required to achieve universal coverage would in reality yield a lower level of coverage (77% population access). By improving efficiency, however, the 920 million ITNs could yield population access as high as 95%."

Recently, there has been a renewed emphasis on using preventive measures to reduce the deaths and illnesses caused by malaria. Insecticide-treated nets are the most prominent preventive measure used in areas where malaria is particularly common. However, despite huge international efforts to send enough nets to the regions that need them, the processes of delivering and distributing the nets are inefficient. This problem is compounded by the fact that little information is available on how many nets people actually own and use within each country.`"

This is based on data collected from national surveys and reports on the delivery and distribution of the nets. The model estimates that in 2013, only 43% of people at risk of malaria slept under a net. Furthermore, 21% of new nets were allocated to households that already had enough nets, an inefficiency that has worsened over the years. Nets are also lost from households much more rapidly than previously thought."

However, Bhatt et al.\u2019s model suggests that given the current inefficiencies in net distribution, the extra nets would in reality protect a much smaller proportion of the population. Taking measures to more effectively target the nets to the households that need them could improve this coverage level to 95% of the population. The next challenge is to devise distribution strategies to send nets to where they are most needed."

The World Health Organization (WHO) promotes a target of universal coverage for all populations at risk with either ITNs or indoor residual spraying (IRS), with the former representing the primary vector control tool in nearly all endemic African countries (<a href=\"#bib35\">WHO, 2013a</a>). The international community has invested billions of dollars in the provision of at least 700 million LLINs since 2004 (<a href=\"#bib35\">WHO, 2013a</a>). While these investments have led to enormous scale up in population access to ITNs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Noor et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Monasch et al., 2004</a>), the target of universal coverage remains distant and millions of African households at risk remain unprotected (<a href=\"#bib35\">WHO, 2013a</a>)."

Central to these efforts is the capacity to monitor reliably current levels of ITN coverage in populations at risk and evaluate the systems that give rise to this coverage. This, in turn, enables progress towards international goals to be tracked and opportunities for efficiency gains to be identified. Such information is essential for evaluating the\u00a0existing commodity and financing shortfalls and assessing future requirements if the target of universal coverage is to be achieved."

Gold standard measurements of these indicators are provided by nationally representative household surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib19\">Measure, 2014</a>), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) (<a href=\"#bib31\">UNICEF, 2012</a>), and Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) (<a href=\"#bib26\">RBM, 2014a</a>). These surveys are carried out relatively infrequently, however, meaning they cannot be used directly for evaluating year-on-year coverage trends or for generating timely estimates of continent-wide coverage levels. In contrast, programmatic data such as the number of ITNs delivered and distributed within countries, while not describing coverage directly, are available for most countries and years (<a href=\"#bib35\">WHO, 2013a</a> ). In a 2009 study, Flaxman and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib8\">Flaxman et al., 2010</a>) used a compartmental modelling approach to link these programmatic and survey data, generating annual estimates of the two ITN indicators recommended at that time on access (<i>% households with at least one ITN</i>) and use (<i>% children &lt; 5\u00a0years\u00a0old who slept under an ITN the previous night</i>)."

An intra-household 'ownership gap' may exist whereby many households with <i>some</i> nets may not have <i>enough</i> for one net between two occupants (the recommended minimum level of protection (<a href=\"#bib33\">WHO, 2013b</a>). Similarly, a 'usage gap' may exist whereby individuals with access to a net do not sleep under it. In response, the measurement of two additional indicators was recommended: <i>% households with at least one ITN for every two people</i> and <i>% population with access to an ITN within their household</i> (assuming each net was used by two people)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">RBM, UNICEF, WHO, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">RBM, 2011</a>). In addition, the indicator on usage was extended to include the entire population rather than only children under 5 years old. This updated set of four indicators, used individually and in combination, has the potential to provide a nuanced picture of ITN access and use patterns that can directly guide operational decision making (<a href=\"#bib10\">Kilian et al., 2013</a>). To achieve this, there is a need to develop modelling frameworks to allow all four to be tracked through time."

In response, systems need to be responsive to emerging coverage gaps by ensuring nets are distributed to households that need them and avoiding over-allocation (i.e. distribution of nets to those that already have them). Together, the rate of net loss and the degree of over-allocation of new nets play a key role in determining how efficiently delivery to countries will translate into household coverage levels. These factors are not currently well understood but triangulation of survey and programmatic data allows new insights into both."

Using the working assumptions of a 3-year ITN lifespan and a 1.8 person-per-net ratio (one-between-two but allowing for odd-numbered households), a simple calculation yields an indicative estimate of 150 million new nets required each year to provide universal coverage to an African population at risk of around 810 million (<a href=\"#bib35\">WHO, 2013a</a>). To support country planning and donor application processes (<a href=\"#bib29\">RBM-HWG, 2014</a>), a more elaborate needs assessment approach has been developed by the RBM Harmonization Working Group (RBM-HWG) and implemented by 41 of the 47 endemic African countries (<a href=\"#bib26\">RBM, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Paintain et al., 2013</a>). The tool takes into account the size and structure of national target populations, a 1.8 person-per-net ratio for mass campaigns, additional routine distribution mechanisms employed by countries, and volumes of previously distributed nets and their likely rates of loss through time. Countries have used these inputs to calculate requirements for new nets to achieve national coverage targets, leading to an estimated continent-wide need for 920 million ITNs over the 2014\u20132017 period (approximately 230 million per year) (<a href=\"#bib26\">RBM, 2014</a>). This tool provides a transparent, intuitive and standardised mechanism for comparing forecasted needs against current financing levels and identifying likely shortfalls. However, calculated needs are sensitive to assumptions about how a given volume of new nets will translate into population coverage, and inefficiencies in the system such as such as over-allocation and rate of net loss are not accounted for explicitly in the current needs assessment exercise."

Some 718 million LLINs have been delivered across the 40 endemic countries since their introduction in 2004. As is well documented (<a href=\"#bib35\">WHO, 2013a</a>), annual LLIN deliveries increased year-on-year from 2004 to 2010, reaching 145 million in that year, but then declined dramatically in 2011 and 2012 to less than half that amount before rising again to 143 million in 2013 (green line). Taking into account rates of loss in households, these LLIN deliveries led to a continental net crop shown by the red line. We estimate that there were 252 million LLINs in sub-Saharan households by the end of 2013, with that net crop growing approximately linearly from 2004, with the exception of a slow-down resulting from the reduced supply of nets in 2011\u20132012. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> shows equivalent distribution and resulting net crop estimates for cITNs, which constituted nearly all ITNs prior to 2005 but diminished rapidly in importance following the introduction of LLINs thereafter."

All four indicators show a similar temporal trend: very low coverage levels and modest year-on-year increases for the first 5 years from 2000, with a marked inflexion point in 2005 and much more rapid gains thereafter. Importantly, however, all four indicators show that the pace of increase has, overall, slowed since 2005. By the end of 2013, we estimate that around two-thirds (66%, 95% CI 62%\u201371%) of households at risk owned at least one ITN. However, less than one-third (31%, 29%\u201334%) owned enough for one ITN between two people. This much lower level of adequate ownership is reflected in the levels of access and use, with 48% (45%\u201351%) of people at risk having access to an ITN within their household (on a one-between-two basis) and 43% (39%\u201346%) sleeping under an ITN the previous night. Comparison of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a> demonstrates that many households that own <i>some</i> ITNs do not own <i>enough</i> for one-between-two, and this is captured in the time-series for the 'ownership gap' (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Encouragingly, this gap has been narrowed from 77% (76%\u201378%) of net-owning households having insufficient nets in 2000 to 56% (54%\u201357%) in 2013. Analysis of the 'use gap' suggested a large majority (89%, 84%\u201393%) of those with access to an ITN in the household slept under it the previous night, and we found no evidence of significant change in this proportion through time."

The most important characteristic of our results is the pronounced shallowing of the delivery-coverage curves: proportionately smaller gains are made in coverage as more LLINs are delivered in an archetypal 'law of diminishing marginal returns'. This means that under a business-as-usual scenario, where current levels of over-allocation and LLIN loss persist, very large increases in LLIN delivery would be required to achieve high coverage. Under this scenario, we estimate that 1 billion LLINs (i.e. an average of 250 million per year) would be required to achieve 80% of the population with access to an LLIN in the household by the end of 2017, although this would only translate into 70% population use."

Reducing ITN loss rate to a 3-year median retention time would have a broadly similar impact, acting in isolation, to minimising over-allocation. If these two hypothetical efficiency gains were combined, however, 80% access could be reached in 2017 with around 560 million nets (140 million per year). We found that the relative importance of the over-allocation and LLIN loss rates changed as more LLINs were introduced. Increasing LLIN retention times was the most important factor at low levels of net delivery, but as more and more nets were provided, over-allocation became progressively more important. This is intuitive since it becomes increasingly difficult to avoid over-allocation as more households obtain adequate numbers of nets."

Our results reinforce a simple message: while gains in ITN coverage have been impressive, there remains an enormous challenge if the goal of universal access is to be achieved and sustained. The importance of the new expanded suite of indicators is also exemplified: while an encouraging two-thirds of households now own at least one ITN, less than half of these have enough to protect everyone who lives there. This ownership gap is narrowing but the disparity remains evident across nearly all countries. Conversely, there is little evidence that non-use of available nets contributes substantially to low coverage levels. We therefore reinforce earlier studies that suggest the overwhelming barrier to not sleeping under an ITN is lack of access rather than lack of use <a href=\"#bib35\">WHO, 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Eisele et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Koenker and Kilian, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Koenker et al., 2014</a>).

Mass distribution campaigns can, in principle, be designed to minimise over-allocation and maximise evenness of nets allocated to households strictly on the basis of households members and pre-existing nets. As other studies have highlighted, however, any possible commodity savings achieved by such strategies must be compared against the operational cost of these more complex distribution mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib37\">Yukich et al., 2013</a>). What is certain is that over-allocation becomes a major barrier to achieving universal coverage when levels of ITN provision are high because most new incoming nets are simply leading to surpluses in many households, while elsewhere there remains a shortfall. This may have a disproportionately high public health impact if those surplus nets are concentrated in households at lowest risk. Wealthier, better educated and more urban households may be better placed to obtain available nets but are often located in regions of lower transmission (<a href=\"#bib30\">Steketee and Eisele, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Webster et al., 2005</a>).

Importantly, we assess loss by comparing total inputs to countries (from deliveries) to total numbers in households (net crop), and so we measure real losses rather than, for example, reallocation of nets between relatives (<a href=\"#bib15\">Koenker et al., 2014</a>). Longer retention times of the sort observed in some local studies are not supported by the body of evidence we have provided by triangulating large-scale net distributions and household survey data. This more rapid loss rate has potentially important implications for existing guidelines. Current RBM guidance is for mass ITN campaigns to be conducted every 3 years, complemented by continuous distribution of nets via routine channels in order to maintain coverage levels between those campaigns. However, whatever levels of coverage are achieved by a given campaign, we estimate that one-half\u00a0of the campaign nets\u00a0distributed, on average, will not be present in households just 2 years later. Our coverage time-series for many countries suggest that routine distribution channels are not yet compensating fully for this rate of loss, often displaying pronounced dips in coverage levels between mass campaigns. Maintaining higher continuous coverage therefore clearly requires some combination of more frequent campaigns, greater ongoing distribution between campaigns, or more durable nets and improved care behaviour by users that lead to longer overall retention times."

Our model is able to provide an estimate for every country and every year of the age-profile of ITNs in households. This raises the possibility of extending the predictions to incorporate modelled or observational data on average rates of net degradation in different contexts (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bri\u00ebt et al., 2012</a>) to explore measures of entomologically effective coverage."

This more realistic framework not only provides the basis for more accurate needs assessments but identifies the relative importance of these different factors in determining the coverage that can be achieved for a given delivery level. Our analysis of future LLIN needs from the present time to 2017 demonstrates how these factors lead to a pronounced law of diminishing returns: as more nets are introduced to a population, proportional increases in coverage diminish, with over-allocation a particular problem at high net provision levels."

Over-allocation is the complex result of different distribution strategies and varying levels of population access to services, and any solution comes with its own cost. Net retention can doubtless be increased by improved LLIN technology coupled with behaviour-change communication efforts, although it is also feasible that retention times may reduce when overall net provision increases (with new nets displacing older ones). Additionally, we look only at the RBM definition of use and ignore the effectiveness of nets in repelling mosquitoes once they are being used. This is potentially an important confounder when considering retention times. While not aiming to provide solutions to these complex challenges, the results we present here provide an analytical framework in which the impact of theoretical efficiency gains can be assessed and this could be extended to include formal cost\u2013effectiveness analysis."

Given that the pattern of diminishing coverage returns for each dollar spent is likely to be unavoidable, the cost\u2013effectiveness of pursuing universal coverage rather than a lower operational target must ultimately be weighed against alternative malaria control investments."

Although very different in implementation, both approached the problem in a similar two-stage process. First, a mechanism was defined for estimating <i>net crop</i> \u2014 the total number of ITNs in households in a country at a given point in time\u2014taking into account inputs to the system (e.g. deliveries of ITNs to a country) and outputs (e.g. the discard of worn ITNs from households). Second, empirical modelling was used to translate estimated net crops into resulting levels of coverage (e.g. access within households). We have adopted a similar analytical outline, but the models we have developed for each stage differ structurally and conceptually from these earlier efforts. Our underlying principle has been to represent the ITN system in a simple and intuitive way and to parameterise that system using a data-driven approach that minimises the reliance on assumptions or small external datasets. In this Methods section, we describe: (i) the main data sources used; (ii) a new compartmental model for estimating net crop that also offers insights into rates of ITN loss from households; (iii) a new coverage model linking net crop to household net access and use that also assesses the efficiency of between-household distribution (i.e. the extent of over-allocation); and (iv) the use of our models to predict future ITN requirements to meet the goal of universal access. A schematic overview of our analytical framework is provided in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, and additional methodological detail is provided in the Supplementary Information."

Additionally, we used data from African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA) on the proportion of populations at risk targeted for ITNs versus IRS, and downscaled targeted populations at risk accordingly.

In this structure, a series of compartments were defined that contained a given number of nets at each time-step, with possible movement of nets from one compartment to another between time-steps (see Supplementary Information). Nets delivered to a country by manufacturers were modelled as first entering a 'country stock' compartment (stored in-country but not yet distributed to households). Nets were then available from this stock for distribution to households by the NMCP or other distribution channels. Years where NMCP distributions were smaller than available country stock represented potential \u2018under-distribution\u2019, with nets left to stockpile rather than reaching households. However, because of the uncertainty associated with NMCP distribution data, these discrepancies could simply reflect under-reporting of distribution levels. To accommodate this uncertainty, we specified the number of nets distributed in a given year as a range, with all available country stock as one extreme (the maximum nets that could be delivered) and the NMCP-reported value (the assumed minimum distribution level) as the other."

In this representation, the net crop simply reflected the differences over time between inputs to and outputs from households. This meant that distribution, net crop, and the loss function together formed a closed system: the three must triangulate exactly and knowledge of any two components allowed the third to be calculated directly. Flaxman et al. (<a href=\"#bib8\">Flaxman et al., 2010</a>) assembled data from six studies on ITN durability and rates of loss. Using a loss function fitted to these data, however, they found that the three components tended not to triangulate: net crops observed in surveys were too small, given the data on nets distributed to households and their modelled rate of loss. Their interpretation was that the number of ITNs distributed each year may be systematically over-reported by NMCPs, and a 'bias parameter' was included in the model, adjusting downward the volume of nets entering households in each country compared with reported levels. As described above, we took a different approach: with no a priori expectation that NMCP distribution reports exaggerate distribution levels. Rather than fitting the loss function to a small external dataset, we fitted this function directly to the distribution and net crop data within the stock-and-flow model itself. Conceptually, this reflected the view that the 560 country-years of distribution data triangulated against the 102 survey-derived national net crop values represented a more impartial and data-driven way of inferring rates of loss than using limited data from local ITN retention studies. Loss functions were fitted on a country-by-country basis, allowed to vary through time, and defined separately for cITNs and LLINs. We compared these fitted loss functions to existing assumptions about rates of net loss from households. The stock-and-flow model was fitted using Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), providing time-series estimates of national household net crop for cITNs and LLINs in each country along with evaluation of under-distribution, all with posterior credible intervals.

In simple terms, a more even distribution yields a greater proportion of households owning nets than if those same nets are concentrated in fewer households. Many recent national surveys report the number of ITNs observed in each surveyed household. This allows, a histogram to be generated that summarises the net ownership pattern (i.e. the proportion of households with zero nets, one net, two nets and so on). By analysing such data from multiple surveys, previous studies have demonstrated that histograms for different countries vary in a broadly predictable way according to national net crop (<a href=\"#bib8\">Flaxman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Yukich et al., 2013</a>). By representing these histograms using a formal statistical distribution (such as the negative binomial), and linking its parameters to net crop, predicted histograms can be generated for any country-year for which a net crop estimate is available (<a href=\"#bib8\">Flaxman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Yukich et al., 2013</a>). These histograms, in turn, allow direct calculation of the first access coverage indicator (<i>% households owning one or more ITN</i>). We took the view that this approach\u2014linking net crop to a statistical distribution, and using the distribution to calculate access indicators\u2014is preferable to the alternative of regressing the access indicators against net crop directly. The latter approach, used in the NetCalc tool (<a href=\"#bib21\">Networks, 2014</a>), is simpler but provides less direct insight into the patterns of between-household ITN distribution that ultimately link net crops to access levels."

Household size also, of course, determines whether a given number of owned nets will be sufficient to provide access to all residents. We extended earlier analyses (<a href=\"#bib8\">Flaxman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Yukich et al., 2013</a>) to explicitly account for household size: using a bivariate (i.e. two- rather than one-dimensional) histogram model to link net crop to ownership distributions for each household size stratum (see Supplementary Information). We replaced the negative binomial distribution with a 2-d zero-truncated Poisson distribution and, for each household size stratum, fitted the distribution using two parameters: (i) the proportion of households with zero ITNs and (ii) the mean number of ITNs per ITN-owning household. Using the household-level data from 83 national surveys, we found that both parameters were strongly related to national net crop, allowing bivariate histograms to be generated for every country-year that were closely representative of the true ITN ownership distribution."

First, the distribution of net ownership tended to vary substantially between households of different sizes within a given country and this variation would be missed if all households were considered together. Accounting for this enabled better fits to the data. This makes sense: all else being equal, larger households would be expected to own more nets than smaller ones and so distribution patterns would differ systematically. Second, the bivariate ownership histograms predicted for each country-year could be used to directly calculate all three indicators of household access. While a simple univariate histogram allows calculation of <i>% households with at least one ITN</i>, a bivariate histogram means the number of both ITNs and people in every household can be triangulated which, in turn, allows direct calculation of the two additional indicators: <i>% households with at least one ITN for every two people</i> and <i>% population with access to an ITN within their household</i>, along with the 'ownership gap' (see Supplementary Information). Linking these bivariate histograms to our annual net crop estimates for each country meant we could predict time-series of the access indicators at the national level from 2000\u20132013, with all parameters fitted in a Bayesian framework providing posterior credible intervals around each time-series. We also combined the country-level results to generate a set of continent-level indicator time-series, representing overall coverage levels among populations at risk in the 40 endemic countries. Third, the bivariate histograms allowed analysis of over-allocation: certain cells of the histogram represented households owning more ITNs than were required to achieve access on a one-between-two basis, and the proportion of the total net crop falling in this category was examined through time for every country."

A total of 83 of the 102 national surveys contained data allowing the relationship to be explored between ITN use and each of the three access indicators with, perhaps unsurprisingly, <i>% population with access to an ITN within their household</i> displaying the largest correlation (adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>= 0.96). We fitted this relationship across the 83 surveys using a simple Bayesian regression model (see Supplementary Information) and used it to predict time-series of the ITN use indicator for every country. The ratio of population use to access revealed the 'usage gap'\u2014the fraction of the population with access to ITNs not using them\u2014and between-country variation in this ratio was also explored."

                                "text": "Our two-stage modelling framework represented the pathway from ITN delivery into countries through to resulting levels of net access and use in households. It also accounted for two potential factors that act to reduce access levels, and allowed these to be quantified through time for each country. Using this architecture, it was possible to simulate delivery of any hypothetical volume of ITNs to a given country over a given future time period, to predict the levels of access and use that would result, and to examine the impact of different amounts of over-allocation and net loss. The current needs assessment exercise that countries are undertaking (<a href=\"#bib29\">RBM-HWG, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">RBM, 2014</a>) is designed to identify the number of LLINs required to achieve coverage targets by 2017. We used our model to estimate the levels of access likely to be achieved if these forecast LLIN commodity needs were met across the 2014\u20132017 period under a 'business as usual' scenario, that\u00a0is, with current levels of over-allocation and net loss, and compared these predicted levels with the objective of universal access among target populations. We then generalized this experiment to predict the likely level of coverage (for all four indicators) achievable by 2017 under a broad spectrum of LLIN delivery levels, equivalent to a total for sub-Saharan Africa (two of the 40 endemic countries in our study did not participate in the RBM-HWG needs assessment exercise [Djibouti and Equatorial Guinea], and so our scenario analysis is based on the set of 38 remaining countries;\u00a0to maintain comparability through time, we combined needs assessment data for mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar, and for Sudan and South Sudan)\u00a0of between zero and 2.5 billion nets across the 4-year period. Further, we ran these simulations under four scenarios: (i) 'business-as-usual' (where current levels of over-allocation and net loss were maintained); (ii) with no over-allocation (new LLINs are distributed preferentially to those households with zero LLINs, then to those with less than one-between-two); (iii) with reduced LLIN net loss by households (using a modelled 3-year median retention time); and (iv) with both no over-allocation and a 3-year median retention time."

In Section S2, we describe the acquisition and processing protocols for data from national household surveys, NMCPs and ITN manufacturers. In Section 3, we describe the Bayesian compartment model which estimates, at quarterly intervals, the total number of ITNs in households in each country (the <i>net crop</i>). In Section 4, we describe a second modelling stage that predicts national-level ITN coverage indicators as a function of predicted net crop. Finally, in Section 5, we describe the use of the modelling framework to predict future ITN coverage levels under a range of hypothetical ITN delivery volumes and efficiency scenarios."

In a given year, a given volume of nets are delivered to a country from manufacturers (Appendix figure 8, green arrows), giving rise to a (as yet undistributed) country stock (Appendix figure 8, orange arrow). Nets from this stock then may be distributed to households in that or subsequent years, as captured by NMCP distribution data (Appendix figure 8, blue arrows). To link the NMCP distributed nets to the direct estimates of the net crop existing within households, we needed to account for the rate of loss of nets from households. That is, once nets are distributed, they remain within households for a given length of time until they are discarded. By tracking the net loss from NMCP deliveries (Appendix figure 8, brown arrows), we were able to estimate the total number of nets in a country at a given time point (e.g. in 2008, when a household survey was conducted [ Appendix figure 8, red arrow] by summing the nets of all ages [Appendix figure 8, purple line]). The compartment model was therefore calibrated by parameterising the loss function in such a way that the net crop observed in each national survey was consistent with the known influx of nets to households (following manufacturer delivery and NMCP distribution) and an estimated rate of loss from households. Our loss function was modelled to be temporally varying for a given country and parameterises the proportion of nets discarded through time."

For use in fitting the compartment model, household-level survey data on ITN ownership needed to be translated into a representative estimate for the total number of nets in a given country. To accomplish this, we summarised each household survey into two variables: the average number of LLINs and cITNs per household and the average household size (i.e. number of residents). The total number of ITNs was then calculated as the product of the population of the country at the time of the survey and the estimated ITNs per-capita as observed in the survey data, taking into account the survey weighting to ensure the arithmetic mean was nationally representative. The calculation of the total number of nets was completed by specifying probability distributions that allowed propagation of uncertainty from the household surveys."

We therefore modelled the likelihood of the manufacturer data in a given country-year as a normally distributed random variable. The manufacturer reports did not report standard errors in the delivery numbers and therefore we assumed a uniformly distributed prior probability on the error.

We scaled the reports to per-capita NMCP distributions to remove country-specific differences. We observed that this combined per-capita distribution approximately followed an exponential distribution with a zero inflation hurdle (to account for no deliveries). Additionally, when looking at the combined reports across time, it was clear that combined distribution varied temporally. We therefore modelled NMCP LLINs and cITNs separately for each year by disaggregating the continent wide per-capita distribution temporally into separate exponentials with zero inflation. Finally, to account for variability due to sample size, we fitted splines through these time series."

However, these variables were modelled on data that did not provide any information about when in the given year nets were distributed. This led to the potential for temporal inconsistency when calibrating survey estimates at an average time in a country-year against NMCP distribution information with no-sub annual temporal resolution. Therefore, we needed to specify a prior on when NMCP distributions occurred within a given country-year. In striving to keep the model as parsimonious as possible, we first modelled a scenario where <i>all</i> NMCP nets were distributed at either the start or end of the year. This, however, did not represent reality adequately, and led to poor calibrations with survey estimates in some instances. We then relaxed this assumption to allow <i>all</i> nets to be delivered at a random point in the year, but again this led to poor calibrations. Finally, we opted for a more realistic distribution scenario where we disaggregated distributions to a quarter- yearly temporal resolution. We then assigned priors on NMCP quarterly net distributions to allow any proportion of nets to be delivered at the start, first quarter, second quarter, third quarter or end of the year. This scheme allowed for maximum flexibility in the model with minimal subjective prior assumptions, and yielded excellent calibrations with survey estimates."

The key to these poor fits is the lack of stratification of the number of ITNs by household size, the absence of which ignores an important determinant on the number of ITNs per household. A more useful summary of <math id=\"inf81\"><mi>H</mi></math> is the inclusions of a second dimension for household size (<a href=\"#fig11\">Appendix figure 3</a>).

This assumption is, to some degree, warranted as countries with serially sampled surveys showed extremely similar household size distribution patterns, and the resulting indicators do not change significantly if a different time point household size distribution is used. Second, for countries with no household size information (due to no relevant surveys), we use an average across all surveys."

However, when evaluating the coverage indicators, we implemented a 'redistribution' algorithm that operated on the modelled two-dimensional histogram, summarising the proportion of households of a given size having a given number of nets for each country-year. From this histogram, we removed those 'surplus' nets from households that that would normally occur due to over-distribution under business-as-usual. These were then redistributed to households with two few nets. This reallocation started with the biggest households with the largest shortfalls and, while surplus nets remained, continued into progressively smaller households until, potentially, every single household had sufficient nets for one-between-two."

The findings show worsening of over-allocation (a measure of inefficiency) over time as overall net provision has increased, and more rapid ITN loss from households than previously thought. This has implications on the universal coverage (only 77%) that can be expected from the current estimate of 920 million additional ITNs that have been computed as the need through 2017. By improving efficiency, however, the 920 million ITNs could yield population access as high as 95%."

The dynamic model developed for this purpose is elegant, building on and refining earlier analysis, and adds value by producing more credible and considerably different estimates of the extent that ITNs are mis-allocated to some households, and the high rates of loss of ITNs from households \u2013 with the resulting inefficiencies varying among countries. The up-to-date estimates of ITN use will be useful to other researchers. Building on similar previous work, the authors have developed a model which allows them to break down coverage into estimates of multiple indicators that take account of the variation in household size, and this is an important advance on previous work. The paper also has projections of the coverage achieved if distribution can be done more efficiently or if people retain their nets for longer \u2013 this is also novel."

In the early years of integrated campaigns nets were allocated to a specific target group (e.g. children under five), but since the shift of policy to universal coverage this has become more difficult. Currently the distribution of nets requires a registration process within a county in order to identify beneficiaries thereby leaving large scope for under- and over-allocation. Work has been done at the Global Fund to strengthen the registration process but they have yet to identify concrete solutions that work at scale. Mozambique, Burundi and Madagascar have implemented systems based on village hierarchy that have been partially effective at small scales, but these do not lend to implementations at the scale of our analysis (country or continent level). Increasingly it is thought that solutions to the problem of over allocation need to be addressed in the planning stages rather than post hoc."

A far more parsimonious explanation is that the differences in the number of LLINs from the Survey and NMCP are explained by the loss of nets occurring through time. This is supported by the increasing bias parameter, as nets get older. Indeed this analysis suggests that the sole purpose of Flaxman et al. bias parameter is to compensate for the deficiencies in their poorly characterised loss function."

The fluctuations are caused by real large deliveries and distributions causing a saw tooth pattern in the number of nets. The reason the number of nets does not increase exponentially with the deliveries is due to loss, but this loss is smooth over time. Using the Flaxman et al. loss function would cause far less smoothness due to restriction of all nets being discarded at the three-year mark. To highlight this consider what would happen in the above plot if all nets were discarded after 3 years. As highlighted in the previous rebuttal the distribution of NMCP ITNs is uniform intra- years, as nothing in the data suggests a non-uniform pattern, thereby implicitly choosing a smooth distribution pattern unless the data would suggest otherwise."

If we used a loss function such as that in Flaxman et al., this sensitivity analysis would be warranted to test the validity of using such a constrained loss function. However, given the data driven, assumption free nature, of our analysis this is unnecessary as the sensitivity analysis is implicitly contained within the Bayesian framework. That is, during every fit, we explore a full range of candidate functions from differing retention times to sharp and smooth transitions and average over these to find the best function that fits the data. Therefore, during every fit, we perform a statistically robust sensitivity analysis. To state this differently our model allows for a loss function similar to that of Flaxman et al., but this loss function is not supported by the data at all."
