Here we show that CNS progenitors, referred to as radial glia, modulate vascular patterning around the spinal cord by acting as negative regulators. We found that radial glia ablation in zebrafish embryos leads to excessive sprouting of the trunk vessels around the spinal cord, and exclusively those of venous identity. Mechanistically, we determined that radial glia control this process via the Vegf decoy receptor sFlt1: <i>sflt1</i> mutants exhibit the venous over-sprouting observed in radial glia-ablated larvae, and sFlt1 overexpression rescues it. Genetic mosaic analyses show that sFlt1 function in trunk endothelial cells can limit their over-sprouting. Together, our findings identify CNS-resident progenitors as critical angiogenic regulators that determine the precise patterning of the vasculature around the spinal cord, providing novel insights into vascular network formation around developing organs."

Here we show that CNS progenitors, referred to as radial glia, modulate vascular patterning around the spinal cord by acting as negative regulators. We found that radial glia ablation in zebrafish embryos leads to excessive sprouting of the trunk vessels around the spinal cord, and exclusively those of venous identity. Mechanistically, we determined that radial glia control this process via the Vegf decoy receptor sFlt1: <i>sflt1</i> mutants exhibit the venous over-sprouting observed in radial glia-ablated larvae, and sFlt1 overexpression rescues it. Genetic mosaic analyses show that sFlt1 function in trunk endothelial cells can limit their over-sprouting. Together, our findings identify CNS-resident progenitors as critical angiogenic regulators that determine the precise patterning of the vasculature around the spinal cord, providing novel insights into vascular network formation around developing organs."

Previous work on the vascularization of different organs has shown that the process starts with angiogenic sprouting from the surrounding vasculature (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kurz et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hogan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sakaguchi et al., 2008</a>). For instance, the vascularization of the central nervous system (CNS) begins with angiogenic sprouting into neural tissues from the peri-neural vascular plexus (PNVP), a network that surrounds the CNS (<a href=\"#bib18\">Feeney and Watterson, 1946</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Strong, 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kurz et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hogan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bautch and James, 2009</a>). Similarly, liver vascularization has been shown to initiate by angiogenic sprouting from the vessels that first surround it (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sakaguchi et al., 2008</a>).

We first tested and confirmed that these lines can induce radial glia or neuron ablation robustly upon administration of Mtz (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013I\u201d</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013I\u201d</a>). Furthermore, we confirmed by acridine orange staining and TUNEL assays that these lines induce apoptotic cell death specifically in the CNS (data not shown), and that when we initiated cell ablation at 30 hpf, radial glia and neurons in the spinal cord are largely segregated as determined by the expression of fluorescent proteins driven by the <i>gfap</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lam et al., 2009</a>) and <i>elavl3</i> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Park et al., 2000</a>) promoters, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>)."

To analyze the role of each cell type in vascular development, we performed the genetic ablation at early developmental stages. We set up an experiment where dechorionated embryos were treated with 2\u2009mM Mtz starting at 30 hpf and assessed vascular patterning at 154 hpf (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We observed that radial glia-ablated fish exhibited largely comparable patterns of the trunk vasculature to controls; however, we found a severe vascular patterning defect in a specific region of radial glia-ablated trunks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>; quantification shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>; n\u00a0=\u00a025 fish for each group). Namely, radial glia-ablated fish developed ectopically sprouting vessels between the ISVs in the dorsal part of the trunk adjacent to the spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). These ectopic vessels were observed at the surface of, but not inside, the spinal cord (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>) and were not observed in control DMSO or 2\u2009mM Mtz treated fish (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; data not shown). Intriguingly, we also did not observe a similar vascular defect in neuron-ablated fish (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D and E</a>; n\u00a0=\u00a025), suggesting a specific role for radial glia in regulating this aspect of trunk vascular patterning. Importantly, these observations also show that the cell responses evoked by massively-induced apoptotic cell death in the CNS are not sufficient to cause this vascular phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013F</a>). Thus, radial glia appear to function as negative angiogenic regulators during the patterning of dorsal ISVs around the spinal cord during development."

We divided the trunk vasculature into dorsal and ventral parts for this quantification. We counted the number of ECs in the dorsal part, including the dorsal ISVs, the VTAs, and the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessels (DLAVs) and found an approximately 30% increase in EC numbers in radial glia-ablated fish compared to control or neuron-ablated fish (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013K</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>; n\u00a0=\u00a06 for each group).

Around 74 hpf, when a majority of radial glia were ablated, we observed ectopic vessel sprouting, and these ectopic vessels continued to grow until 6\u20137 dpf (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013P</a>; data not shown). Furthermore, by comparing radial glia-ablated fish that were treated with Mtz for different lengths of time, we found that the emergence of the ectopic vessels correlated with regions where radial glia were robustly ablated (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1Q\u2013W\u2019</a>), indicating that radial glia modulate nearby vessels to prevent their over-sprouting. To determine when radial glia regulate vascular patterning in the trunk, we ablated radial glia at different developmental stages. Ectopic vessel sprouting emerged only when we initiated radial glia ablation at early developmental stages, i.e., before 60 hpf, suggesting a critical developmental time window of negative angiogenic action of radial glia and/or the vessels\u2019 response (data not shown)."

We found that overexpression of sFlt4 by heat shocking the embryos at 29, 36, and 43 hpf, stages when angiogenic sprouting from the PCV actively occurs, recapitulated these mutant phenotypes, resulting in a reduced number of vISVs (approximately 9% vISVs remaining per transgenic fish on average, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C,E</a>, and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>; n\u00a0=\u00a023). Notably, when we performed radial glia ablation in these fish with a reduced number of vISVs, we found that the ectopic sprouting after radial glia ablation was dramatically reduced as compared to non-heat shocked or heat shocked control siblings (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B\u2013D and F</a>; n\u00a0=\u00a015 for each group), which have approximately 55% vISVs on average (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>; n\u00a0=\u00a018). These results provide further evidence that radial glia ablation causes the excessive sprouting of venous ECs predominantly, and thus suggest that radial glia negatively regulate the over-sprouting of dorsal trunk venous vessels during development."

                                "text": "An endogenous protein that is known to act as a negative regulator of Vegf/Vegfr2 signaling is sFlt1. Previous studies have shown that sFlt1 functions as a Vegf decoy receptor and thereby limits angiogenic sprouting induced by Vegf/Vegfr2 signaling (Ruiz <a href=\"#bib59\">de Almodovar et al., 2009</a>). We thus hypothesized that radial glia negatively modulate Vegf/Vegfr2 signaling via sFlt1 to prevent vISV over-sprouting. To test this hypothesis, we generated zebrafish <i>sflt1</i> mutants by targeted genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We identified a mutation, <i>bns29</i>, which is predicted to lead to a premature stop codon at tyrosine residue 86 of both sFlt1 and a membrane-bound form of Flt1/Vegfr1 (mFlt1) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also used <i>flt1<sup>fh390</sup></i> mutants, which are predicted to lack the transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains of mFlt1 without affecting sFlt1 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rossi et al., 2016</a>), in order to determine the role of mFlt1. The genotypes of <i>flt1<sup>bns29</sup></i> and <i>flt1<sup>fh390</sup></i> animals were determined by high resolution melt analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Interestingly, we observed that the <i>flt1<sup>fh390</sup></i> mutants, which lack mFlt1 signaling function, do not exhibit any obvious vascular phenotypes in the trunk (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>; n\u00a0=\u00a020). However, we found that the <i>flt1<sup>bns29</sup></i> mutants, which lack sFlt1 function, exhibit ectopic vessel sprouting specifically around the spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013J</a>; n\u00a0=\u00a020\u201324 for each genotype), a phenotype similar to that found after radial glia ablation. Thus, phenotypic analyses of these different <i>flt1</i> mutants suggest that sFlt1, but not mFlt1, functions to prevent excessive sprouting of ISVs in the dorsal trunk. In addition, we found that ectopic vessel sprouting in <i>flt1<sup>bns29</sup></i> mutants begins around 74 hpf, and that these ectopic vessels mostly derive from vISVs, as observed after radial glia ablation. As assessed by <i>Tg(-0.8flt1:</i>tdTomato) expression, ectopic sprouts in <i>flt1<sup>bns29</sup></i> mutants mostly derive from vISVs at 100 hpf (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K\u2013K\u201d</a>) and at 154 hpf exhibit weak <i>Tg(-0.8flt1:</i>tdTomato) expression as vISVs do (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L\u2013L\u201d</a>), which is again very similar to what was observed after radial glia ablation."

Notably, we found that <i>flt1<sup>bns29/+</sup></i> fish exhibit a markedly increased degree of ISV over-sprouting after partial radial glia ablation as compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>; n\u00a0=\u00a033), providing evidence that radial glia ablation and sFlt1 functionally interact.

Our findings reveal that radial glia within the CNS act as negative as well as selective angiogenic regulators that determine the precise patterning of the venous vasculature around the developing spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I</a>). Specifically, we found that radial glia ablation in zebrafish embryos leads to the over-sprouting of venous ISVs around the spinal cord, a process driven by Vegf/Vegfr2 signaling; we also found that <i>sflt1</i> mutants recapitulate the vascular phenotype observed after radial glia ablation, and that sFlt1 acts downstream of radial glia and functions in endothelial cells to limit venous over-sprouting around the spinal cord. Altogether, these findings suggest a model whereby radial glia positively regulate sFlt1 function in endothelial cells to establish the precise venous patterning around the spinal cord during embryonic and early larval development, providing critical and novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the vascular networks around developing organs are patterned."

First, we speculate that the regulation of vascular patterning around the developing CNS by radial glia may constitute a means to ensure optimal vascularization for CNS function, and thus, determining the functional relevance of the observed vascular defects is one of the critical next steps. These findings indicate more generally that progenitor cells in developing organs may function as critical regulators to establish the microenvironment for the mature organs derived from these progenitors. Second, it will be of particular interest to the neuroscience and vascular biology fields to further investigate how CNS radial glia differentially modulate arterial and venous ECs. Recent studies have discovered a lymphatic network lining the meningeal dura mater of the mouse brain (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aspelund et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Louveau et al., 2015</a>), and whose architecture is very distinct from that of the arterial and venous networks in the CNS. Our identification of spinal cord radial glia as negative as well as selective angiogenic regulators that specifically affect venous vessels is intriguing in light of previous studies that revealed neuronal progenitors as positive angiogenic regulators that initiate arterial sprouting into neural tissues (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kurz et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Haigh et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kurz, 2009</a>). These findings may indicate that CNS-resident progenitors are able to differentially regulate the patterning of these distinct vessel networks within as well as around the CNS."

One hypothesis is that the distinct density and/or characteristics of perivascular cells that cover arteries and veins play a role in this process. Indeed, it was recently shown that in zebrafish, mural cells emerge around the ISVs starting at 48 hpf and that they preferentially cover aISVs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ando et al., 2016</a>). Preferential coverage of arteries by mural cells was also observed in mouse embryos (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hellstrom et al., 1999</a>). This differential coverage of arterial and venous ISVs by mural cells may explain the near exclusive over-sprouting of vISVs after radial glia ablation and in <i>sflt1</i> mutants. Perhaps, coverage of aISVs by mural cells blocks most communication between radial glia and arterial ECs. To begin to test this hypothesis, we carefully analyzed <i>pdgfrb<sup>um148</sup></i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kok et al., 2015</a>), which should exhibit a slightly decreased number of ISV-covering mural cells as previously shown in <i>pdgfrb<sup>sa16389</sup></i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ando et al., 2016</a>), after ablating radial glia starting at 30 hpf. However, we did not observe a significantly increased number of over-sprouting aISV in these experiments (data not shown). We speculate that apparently decreased, yet incompletely eliminated, ISV-covering mural cells in these <i>pdgfrb</i> mutant animals (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kok et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ando et al., 2016</a>) could still protect aISVs from over-sprouting after radial glia ablation. Alternative approaches that allow complete ablation of ISV-covering mural cells will be needed to address this issue in a more conclusive manner."

Previous work indicates that Sema/PlxnD1 signaling positively regulates <i>sflt1</i> expression in zebrafish embryos (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zygmunt et al., 2011</a>). It was shown that <i>sflt1</i> transcripts detected with a <i>sflt1</i>-specific riboprobe were markedly decreased in <i>plxnd1<sup>fov01b</sup></i> mutants and that <i>sflt1</i> transcript levels measured by qPCR were also reduced in <i>plxnd1<sup>fov01b/+</sup></i> embryos compared to WT (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zygmunt et al., 2011</a>). Although we did not observe ectopic sprouting from the DA in <i>flt1<sup>bns29</sup></i> mutants as was seen in <i>plxnd1<sup>fov01b</sup></i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zygmunt et al., 2011</a>), it is still possible that this signaling pathway mediates the negative angiogenic effects of radial glia and regulates <i>sflt1</i> expression to limit venous over-sprouting around the spinal cord. Continuous overexpression of dominant-negative PlxnD1 in ECs from late embryonic stages (around 2.5 dpf) may allow us to test this hypothesis. Regarding sFlt1 function, our genetic mosaic analyses show that sFlt1 function in ECs can limit venous over-sprouting around the spinal cord. However, <i>TgBAC(flt1:</i>YFP) expression is also observed in small subsets of spinal cord neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B\u2019</a>)(<a href=\"#bib34\">Krueger et al., 2011</a>). Although we did not observe vISV over-sprouting in neuron-ablated fish (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>), which show a loss of <i>TgBAC(flt1:</i>YFP) expression in the spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B\u2019</a>), it is possible that Flt1 in spinal cord neurons may also contribute to the vISV over-sprouting phenotype observed in <i>flt1<sup>bns29</sup></i> mutants. Finally, whether the communication between radial glia and venous ECs involves secreted factors and/or direct cell-cell communication remains a major question to resolve."

Therefore, our identification of a critical role for CNS-resident progenitors in patterning the vasculature around the CNS will advance our understanding of the mechanisms governing vascular network formation, in particular how distinct vessel networks, as well as vascularization patterns, around developing organs are formed."

To wash away the Mtz, fish embryos/larvae were washed twice in dishes containing egg water. Although a minority of the animals developed prominent pericardial edema and/or severe gross anatomical abnormalities after radial glia or neuronal ablation, most did not exhibit such abnormalities except non-inflated swim bladders and bent tails. We analyzed only the animals that did not exhibit pericardial edema or severe gross anatomical abnormalities.

Employing a variety of genetic tools in zebrafish, they demonstrate that ablation of radial glia leads to excessive venous sprouting, that this excessive sprouting requires Vegfr/Vegfr2 signaling, and that the normal repression of excessive venous sprouts is dependent on sFlt1 function within venous cells. The experiments are well-designed, the data are nicely presented, and the interpretation of the results is clear-cut. The implication of sFlt1 as a repressor of vascular sprouting in this context is consistent with previous work on sFlt1 function in other settings. The particular significance of this work comes from its novel demonstration that radial glia play an important role in patterning the CNS vascular network."

Regarding <i>pdgfrb<sup>-/-</sup></i>larvae, these mutants indeed lack a majority of brain pericytes as previously shown by Ando K. et al., (Development: 143, 1328-39, 2016) as well as by our analysis using a <i>TgBAC(pdgfrb:citrine)<sup>s984</sup></i> pericyte reporter line (data not shown). However, mural cells that cover ISVs appear to be only mildly affected in <i>pdgfrb<sup>-/-</sup></i> larvae as shown in the mentioned article. We speculate that apparently decreased, yet incompletely eliminated, mural cells could still protect aISVs from over-sprouting after radial glia ablation, thus potentially explaining why only very few aISVs over-sprout in <i>pdgfrb<sup>-/-</sup></i> larvae after radial glia ablation."

However, a vast majority of the fish in which both cell types were ablated by this method developed pericardial edema and an unhealthy appearance, making it more complicated and difficult to assess over-sprouting from aISVs and vISVs. We think that it may work slightly better to perform mural cell ablation in <i>flt1<sup>bns29</sup></i> mutants rather than in radial glia-ablated fish. However, it may also lead to similar results as genetic ablation of mural cells using <i>TgBAC(pdgfrb:gal4ff)<sup>ncv24</sup></i> fish basically caused pericardial edema and an unhealthy appearance. We think that inducing mural cell ablation using the <i>TgBAC(pdgfrb:gal4ff)<sup>ncv24</sup></i> line is currently the best possible approach to test this hypothesis given the available tools. However, we are not sure whether this approach will completely eliminate all mural cells (pericytes and smooth muscle cells) that cover the ISVs; in addition, this experiment requires 4 different transgenes in <i>flt1<sup>bns29</sup></i> mutants, namely <i>TgBAC(pdgfrb:gal4ff);Tg(UAS:mcherry-NTR);Tg(kdrl:EGFP);Tg(-0.8flt1:tdTomato)</i> and thus the generation and analyses of these animals will require substantial time, and may end up with an inconclusive answer for the reasons mentioned above. We thus would like to fully investigate the mechanisms and pursue this important question in future studies by generating and testing other possible hypotheses and tools. However, to clarify our hypothesis and rationale behind the potential contribution of perivascular cells to selective vISV responses in radial glia-ablated or <i>flt1<sup>bns29</sup></i> mutant fish, we discuss these points more clearly in our revised manuscript by citing the mentioned article that reports the mildly affected mural cells in <i>pdgfrb<sup>-/-</sup></i>larvae."

Closely related to the point 2), we speculate that there are additional mechanisms that protect aISVs from over-sprouting after radial glia ablation. As we described above, one hypothesis we have pursued is the aspect of distinct coverage of aISVs and vISVs by perivascular cells. However, the experiments we performed and plan to perform may not get us a conclusive answer due to the technical issues we have faced as mentioned above. In addition, there should be a lot more possibilities other than this hypothesis, and thus we would like to address this important issue fully in future studies."
