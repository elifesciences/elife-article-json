Using biochemistry and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), we show here that Fam65b oligomers form a circumferential ring near the basal taper of the mechanically sensitive stereocilia of murine hair cells. Taperin, a second protein near the taper, forms a dense-core-like structure that is disrupted in the absence of Fam65b. Stereocilia of <i>Fam65b</i>-deficient murine hair cells start to develop, but mechanotransduction is affected and stereocilia deteriorate. Yeast-two-hybrid screens identify RhoC as a Fam65b binding partner. RhoC co-localizes with Fam65b in stereocilia and regulates Fam65b oligomerization. Binding to RhoC and oligomerization are critical for Fam65b function. Our findings thus reveal a highly organized compartment near the base of stereocilia that is critical for hair cell function and affected in disease."

Using biochemistry and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), we show here that Fam65b oligomers form a circumferential ring near the basal taper of the mechanically sensitive stereocilia of murine hair cells. Taperin, a second protein near the taper, forms a dense-core-like structure that is disrupted in the absence of Fam65b. Stereocilia of <i>Fam65b</i>-deficient murine hair cells start to develop, but mechanotransduction is affected and stereocilia deteriorate. Yeast-two-hybrid screens identify RhoC as a Fam65b binding partner. RhoC co-localizes with Fam65b in stereocilia and regulates Fam65b oligomerization. Binding to RhoC and oligomerization are critical for Fam65b function. Our findings thus reveal a highly organized compartment near the base of stereocilia that is critical for hair cell function and affected in disease."

                        "text": "Hair cells of the mammalian cochlea have a specialized morphology that is optimized for their role as mechanical sensors for sound. Each hair cell contains at the apical surface a bundle of stereocilia that are organized in rows of decreasing height (<a href=\"#bib23\">Petit and Richardson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Schwander et al., 2010</a>). Stereocilia are cylindrical in shape but form at their base a taper (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) that is critical for their function because stereocilia pivot at their base during mechanical stimulation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fettiplace and Kim, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">M\u00fcller and Barr-Gillespie, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Zhao and M\u00fcller, 2015</a>). Confocal imaging of isolated bullfrog hair cells has shown that the membrane of stereocilia is spatially segregated into at least three domains including a specialized basal taper domain (<a href=\"#bib41\">Zhao et al., 2012</a>). Genetic studies combined with immunolocalization experiments have identified several proteins that are concentrated at or near the taper. Cell surface receptors such as PTPRQ, USH2A and VLGR1 form extracellular filaments near the taper and recruit several cytoplasmic proteins that might link the receptors to the cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adato et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">McGee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Michalski et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Salles et al., 2014</a>). Myosin motor proteins such as Myo6 and Myo7A are also localized near the taper (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hasson et al., 1997</a>) and may be important for protein transport or for adjusting tension between the cell membrane and the cytoskeleton. Proteins with potential roles in regulating F-actin dynamics and/or anchorage to the cell membrane such as radixin and taperin are concentrated at the taper region as well (<a href=\"#bib22\">Pataky et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Rehman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Salles et al., 2014</a>). In addition, TRIOBP forms rootlets that extend from stereocilia into the cuticular plate and traverse the taper region (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kitajiri et al. 2010</a>). Importantly, mutations in the genes that encode proteins localized near the taper cause inherited forms of deafness (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmed et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Khan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Liu et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Rehman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Schraders et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Weil et al., 1997</a>), thus reinforcing the concept that the taper is a specialized and functionally important subdomain within stereocilia. However, the overall organization of proteins at the base of stereocilia and the mechanisms that regulate their assembly and function are not known."

We show here that Fam65b is localized near the basal taper of hair-cell stereocilia where it forms oligomers by head-to-head and tail-to-tail interaction to form a circumferential ring that does not penetrate the stereociliary core. In contrast, taperin is localized throughout the stereociliary core. Biochemical data suggest that Fam65b does not bind to taperin or any of the proteins that are known to bind to taperin. Instead, using a yeast-two-hybrid screen, we have identified RhoC as a binding partner for Fam65b and show that RhoC regulates Fam65b oligomerization. Defects in Fam65b expression, oligomerization and binding to RhoC affect stereocilia development and function and cause deafness. Our findings thus reveal a striking spatial segregation of proteins within the basal domain of stereocilia, provide insights into the mechanisms that regulate protein assembly in this critical functional domain and reveal a role of Fam65b for normal stereocilia morphogenesis and function."

We also observed staining in the microvilli of other support cells that did not stain with X-gal. The cells were presumably X-gal negative because expression levels were low and thus difficult to detect with X-gal staining. Clearly, the antibody staining signals were specific because they were not observed in <i>Fam65b<sup>LacZ/LacZ\u00a0</sup></i>mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Higher resolution images showed that Fam65b was expressed in IHCs and OHCs at the basal end of stereocilia near the taper region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). To confirm this finding, we used injectoporation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Xiong et al., 2012</a>) to express HA-tagged Fam65b in mechanosensory hair cells at P3.

At P2 the bundles of most OHCs appeared similar in size to wild-type and formed a staircase pattern but some OHCs showed defects in hair bundle polarity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). In contrast, hair bundles of most IHCs were already severely disorganized (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). To quantify polarity defects in OHCs, we determined the deviation of the position of the bundle center, which contains the longest stereocilia, from their normal position at the tip of the V-shaped bundle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Unlike in control heterozygous <i>Fam65b<sup>LacZ/+</sup></i> mice, bundle orientation of OHCs was far more variable in <i>Fam65b<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>)."

We stimulated hair bundles of OHCs at P5 with a stiff glass probe and recorded mechanotransduction currents in the whole-cell configuration. As previously reported, control OHCs from <i>Fam65b<sup>LacZ/+</sup></i> mice had rapidly activating transducer currents, which subsequently adapted (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gillespie and M\u00fcller, 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Mechanotransduction currents could also be evoked in OHCs from <i>Fam65b<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup></i> mice but peak currents were reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The amplitude of saturated mechanotransduction currents at maximal deflection was at 417.16 \u00b1 103.77\u2009pA (mean \u00b1 SEM) for control OHCs and 232.60 \u00b1 123.75\u2009pA (mean \u00b1 SEM) for OHCs from mutant mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). To normalize for variations in amplitude between control and mutant animals, we also plotted the open probability of the transduction channel (P<sub>0</sub>) against displacement. The resulting curve in the mutant animals was slightly shifted to the right and broadened (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The resting potential was comparable in OHCs from control and mutant animals (data not shown), suggesting that the change in transduction and in the displacement- P<sub>0</sub> relationship was not a simple consequence of hair cell deterioration alone. However, given the structural defects in hair bundles of <i>Fam65b<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup></i> mice, it seems likely that effects on transduction were caused at least in part by the morphological defects in hair bundles."

To determine the extent to which defects in mechanotransduction in <i>Fam65b</i>-deficient hair cells could be rescued by re-expression of Fam65b, we injectoporated control and <i>Fam65b</i>-deficient hair cells at P2 with an expression vector for G-CaMP3 and a Fam65b construct carrying an HA-tag. After two days in culture, we mechanically stimulated hair bundles with a fluid jet with three consecutive pulses increasing in duration from 0.1 s, to 0.3 s and 0.5 s. Hair cells from control mice responded with a robust increase in fluorescence, while the response in <i>Fam65b</i>-deficient hair cells was significantly decreased (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). Expression of HA-Fam65b in <i>Fam65b</i>-deficient hair cells restored transduction to similar levels as in controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). We also visualized injectoporated hair cells with an antibody to HA to detect HA-Fam65b and visualized hair bundles by staining with phalloidin. Expression of HA-Fam65b did not affect the morphology of control hair cells but it rescued the morphological defects in hair cells from <i>Fam65b</i>-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). These findings provide further evidence that Fam65b is required cell autonomously in hair cells to regulate their morphology and function, and show that functional defects can be repaired even in hair cells at early postnatal ages."

We attempted to apply this technique to mechanosensory hair cells. To analyze whether Fam65b and taperin are organized in a particular pattern at the base of stereocilia, we labeled cochlear whole mounts at P7 with antibodies to Fam65b and taperin. Following incubation with secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Flour 647 we visualized protein distribution using STORM microscopy. The images revealed the localization of Fam65b and taperin at the base of stereocilia, but remarkably in distinct distribution patterns. At lower magnifications both Fam65b and taperin outlined the general shape of the stereociliary bundle of OHCs and IHCs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,D</a>), similar to deconvolution microscopy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). At higher magnifications only accessible via STORM, Fam65b appeared as punctate dots that formed a circumferential ring outlining the edges of individual stereocilia (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). In contrast, taperin appeared as dense puncta that extended into the core of stereocilia (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). Fam65b ring-like structures were most clearly visible under the tallest row of stereocilia of IHCs. We therefore carried out measurements to determine the diameter of Fam65b ring-like structures and taperin circles in the tallest row of stereocilia of P7 inner hair cells using NIS-Elements AR analysis software."

As with deconvolution microscopy, both proteins could no longer be detected in the taper region in <i>Fam65b<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup></i> mice (data not shown). These findings provide evidence that while both Fam65b and taperin are present near the taper of stereocilia, they show a distinct distribution pattern. Taperin is more widely expressed throughout the core of the stereocilium and Fam65b is present in a circumferential ring that might partially overlap with the distribution of taperin. Taperin is no longer concentrated near the taper region in <i>Fam65b</i>-deficient hair cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), which could be a direct consequence of effects of Fam65b on taperin or a secondary consequence caused by disruptions in the structure of the basal domain of stereocilia."

We cloned full-length cDNAs for taperin, CLIC5, radixin and whirlin, fused them to HA and co-expressed them with Fam65b-GFP in HEK293 cells. For PTPRQ, we expressed the cytoplasmic domain fused to HA. Immunoprecipitation experiments did not reveal any interactions between Fam65b-GFP with HA-taperin, HA-CLIC5, HA-radixin, HA-whirlin, and HA-PTPRQcyto (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>, and data not shown). To further confirm these findings, we also expressed HA-Fam65 and Myc-taperin in CL4 cells but did not observe an interaction between the two proteins (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly, we did not observe interaction between Fam65b and taperin in a two-hybrid assay where we used Fam65b as a bait and taperin as a prey (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results are consistent with the distinct localization pattern of Fam65b and taperin, and suggest a compartmentalized distribution of protein complexes within the basal compartment of stereocilia. They also suggest that the Fam65b regulates taperin localization via an alternative mechanism than direct binding. Unfortunately, we could not extend our analysis of protein distribution to CLIC5, radixin and whirlin because available antibodies were not of sufficient quality for STORM (data not shown)."

To determine the extent to which Fam65b oligomerizes we cloned full-length Fam65b as well as N- and C-terminal fragments (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). First, we generated full-length Fam65b constructs containing N-terminal HA and C-terminal GFP tags and expressed them alone or in combination in HEK293 cells. We then carried out immunoprecipitations using an antibody to HA. Fam65b-GFP efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Fam65b (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), demonstrating that Fam65b has homophilic binding affinity. To map protein domains important for interactions, we next generated truncated Fam65b constructs fused to a Myc-tag. Sequence comparison of Fam65b across species revealed five highly conserved domains near the N-terminus, two highly conserved domains near the C-terminus and a less conserved central domain (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We therefore generated Fam65b constructs containing the N-terminal or C-terminal conserved domains alone (Myc-N1, Myc-C2) or in conjunction with the less conserved central domain (Myc-N2, Myc-C1) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Myc-N1 and Myc-C1 both interacted with full-length Fam65b-GFP (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), indicating that there are at least two binding sites in Fam65b that mediate homophilic interactions. Myc-N1 efficiently interacted with N1-GFP and N2-GFP but not with C1-GFP or C2-GFP (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013G</a>). Likewise Myc-C1 efficiently interacted with C1-GFP and C2-GFP but not with N1-GFP or N2-GFP (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013G</a>). We thus conclude that Fam65b molecules can interact with each other via their N-termini and via their C-termini, which could lead to the formation of concatemers."

We hypothesized that overexpression of a Fam65b fragment containing one Fam65b binding site might disrupt homophilic interactions between Fam65b molecules thus acting as a dominant negative construct. To test this model, we first determined the extent to which interactions between full-length Fam65b-GFP with Myc-N1 was disrupted by co-expression of N2-GFP in heterologous HEK293 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that N2-GFP significantly reduced interactions between Fam65b-GFP and Myc-N1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>). Next we expressed by injectoporation full-length Fam65b-GFP or the dominant negative construct N2-GFP in hair cells at P2 and cultured the cells for 3 days. Cells expressing the heterologous constructs were identified by GFP fluorescence and hair bundles were visualized by staining with phalloidin-rhodamine. Significantly, while Fam65b-GFP did not affect the morphology of hair bundles (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I,J</a>), bundle morphology was severely disrupted by overexpression of N2-GFP (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I,J</a>).

We therefore set out to identify binding partners for Fam65b that might regulate its function and oligomerization using an unbiased yeast-two-hybrid screen. We purified RNA from the organ of Corti and generated yeast-two-hybrid libraries suitable for the identification of soluble and transmembrane proteins. We then carried out yeast-two-hybrid screens with full-length Fam65b. We screened more than 2 million transformants and identified 50 positive clones. Sequencing of the clones revealed that we had recovered RhoC 28 times and RhoA 1 time (data not shown). In fact, RhoA has been previously shown to be a binding partner for Fam65b (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gao et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Rougerie et al., 2013</a>), but interactions with RhoC have not been evaluated so far. To confirm our yeast-two-hybrid data, we generated HA-tagged versions of RhoA, RhoC and the related Rac1 and Cdc42 molcules and tested for interactions with Fam65b following their expression in HEK293 cells. Fam65b bound highly efficiently to RhoC, weakly to RhoA, and not at all to Rac1 and Cdc42 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Taken together, these data provide evidence that Fam65b binds strongly to RhoC but much weaker to RhoA."

The quantification of the data was facilitiated by the fact that morphological defects in hair bundles from mutant mice are exaggerated in vitro, presumably because the bundles are fragile and more easily disrupted during the culture period compared to wild-type. Thus most hair bundles in cultured OHCs are either round or fragmented, which is in stark contrast to the V-shape of the bundles of OHCs in wild-type.

Using STORM microscopy we provide here insights into the spatial arrangement of cytosolic proteins within the basal domain of stereocilia at a resolution that had not been possible with other more common fluorescence microscopy techniques. These imaging experiments combined with biochemical and functional studies also provide insights into the function of Fam65b, a protein that has been previously linked to inherited forms of deafness but whose molecular and cellular function has remained unknown. Our findings provide evidence that Fam65b oligomers form a circumferential ring-like structure in the basal domain of each stereocilium and that this structure is critical for the maintenance of the morphology of the hair bundle. In the absence of the Fam65b the taper region appears abnormally shaped and hair bundles start to form but show degenerative changes before they reach maturity. Oligomerization of Fam65b depends on binding of Fam65b to RhoC, which co-localizes with Fam65b in the basal domain of stereocilia. In contrast, taperin binds to distinct proteins and is distributed within the basal domain through the core of each stereocilium. Taperin distribution is disrupted in the <i>Fam65b</i>-deficient hair cells suggesting a potential functional interaction between taperin and Fam65b, but our biochemical data suggest that Fam65b and taperin do not interact directly. We therefore conclude that Fam65b has a critical function in the maintenance of the basal domain of stereocilia, and that defects in this process likely are the underlying cause of deafness in humans and mice with mutations in the <i>Fam65b</i> gene."

We show here that <i>Fam65b</i>-deficient mice similarly are deaf already at 4 weeks of age, the first time point analyzed. Studies with morpholinos directed against Fam65b in zebrafish suggest that Fam65b is required for normal hair cell survival. However, we did not observed defects in hair cell survival at 2 and 4 weeks after birth, suggesting that the death of hair cells is not the primary cause of the auditory phenotype in mice lacking Fam65b. The difference in cell survival observed in the previous and current study may be attributed to species-specific functions for Fam65b. In <i>Fam65b</i>-deficient mice, we observe defects in hair bundle morphology already in the first few days after birth suggesting that degenerative changes are manifest prior to the onset of hearing in mice. The structural defects are associated with defects in mechanotransduction, indicating functional defects in hair cells that likely cause the auditory phenotype of the mutant mice. However, it is unclear whether the defects are caused by direct effects of Fam65b that affect the transduction process, for example by affecting the stiffness of stereocilia, or if the defects are a secondary consequence of the morphological hair-bundle defects that might affect transduction secondarily, for example by affecting the integrity of tip links. Further studies with more subtle mutations in Fam65b that do not dramatically affect hair bundle morphology might be informative."

Regardless of the involvement of supporting cells, defects in hair bundles of hair cells are likely cell-autonomous because we can induce them by knock-down of Fam65b expression in hair cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and rescue them by re-expression of Fam65b in <i>Fam65b</i>-deficient hair cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

We used an antibody to the C-terminus of Fam65b, which has very low homology with Fam65a/c. Perhaps hair cells express Fam65a,b,c and <a href=\"#bib3\">Diaz-Horta et al.

Membrane-targeting was mainly inferred previously because sequence comparison indicated that Fam65b might have a PX-BAR domain that can associate with membranes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Diaz-Horta et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Farooq and Tekin, 2014</a>). However, this conclusion was subsequently contested (<a href=\"#bib33\">Teasdale and Collins, 2014</a>). Using STORM microscopy, we have now refined the localization of Fam65b within stereocilia and demonstrate that it is concentrated at their basal domain and not localized uniformly along the entire length of stereocilia. In addition, we show that Fam65b is localized in a circumferential ring near the stereociliary base and does not penetrate the core of stereocilia. The distribution of Fam65b in hair cells would be consistent with localization at the membrane but it is currently not clear whether Fam65b directly binds to the membrane or is targeted to its location within stereocilia by interaction with other proteins. One intriguing possibility is that Fam65b might contain a modified PX-BAR domain that facilitates interactions with the specific lipids that have been shown to be concentrated at the stereociliary base (<a href=\"#bib41\">Zhao et al., 2012</a>)."

We show here that Fam65b binds much more strongly to RhoC than to RhoA but we did not observe effects of Fam65b on RhoC activity. Instead, we show that RhoC co-localized with Fam65b in stereocilia and regulates Fam65b oligomerization. Oligomerization is driven by interactions between the N-termini of Fam65b, which are promoted by RhoC, and by interactions between the C-termini suggesting that Fam65b monomers can assemble into extended filaments. In fact, STORM imaging of Fam65b following its expression in heterologous cells (data not shown) suggests that oligomerization leads to linear filaments that can also bend into ring-like structures similar to those observed in hair cells. One interesting possibility would be that Fam65b oligomers form spring-like structures near the membrane at the base of stereocilia that affect the mechanical properties of the bundle. We are currently carrying out structural studies to address this possibility."

While we cannot exclude that these proteins interact in some context, for example when they carry hair-cell specific posttranslational modifications, the findings nevertheless suggest the existence of functionally distinct protein complexes near the basal taper of stereocilia. Our STORM imaging data further provide evidence that taperin has a distribution in hair cells different from Fam65b. While both proteins are localized near the base of stereocilia, only taperin is localized within the core of stereocilia. Fam65b instead forms a circumferential ring. The diameter of the domain occupied by taperin and of the Fam65b ring are similar, raising the possibility that the two compartments show partially overlap. Unfortunately, antibodies to CLIC5 and radixin were not of sufficient quality to use them in STORM microscopy, but one might predict that CLIC5 and radixin, which are thought to form a protein complex with taperin (<a href=\"#bib26\">Salles et al., 2014</a>), have a similar distribution at the base of stereocilia as taperin. Taperin localization is perturbed in the absence of Fam65b, suggesting that the distribution of protein complexes containing Fam65b and taperin is interdependent. Perhaps the two protein complexes are connected by a linker protein that still needs to be identified. Alternatively, the proteins might be components of distinct molecular complexes with separate function. Regardless, our data strongly suggest that Fam65b expression and oligomerization is critical for maintaining the structural organization of the basal domain of stereocilia and that mutations in Fam65b cause deafness at least in part by affecting stereocilia morphogenesis and function. Re-expression of Fam65b in <i>Fam65b</i>-deficient hair cells at postnatal ages rescued their morphological defects, suggesting that it might be possible to repair hair cell damage in human patients with mutations in the <i>FAM65B</i> gene."

Notably, the stereocilia of hair cells contain hundreds of proteins many of which are affected in disease (<a href=\"#bib17\">Krey et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Petit and Richardson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Shin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Wilmarth et al., 2015</a>). However, stereocilia are small in size and it is challenging to define the function of individual proteins without precise spatial information. Our data show that STORM microscopy can be applied successfully to hair cells and will thus be a useful tool to investigate the spatial organization of proteins in stereocilia in normal and pathological conditions."

However, the evidence was drawn from visual display of a small, selected region at the edge of one cell where the label density and the density of localization points is extremely low. In this case, the displayed ring-like structure in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>-iii, which contains only 9 localization points, could simply be random coincidence. The string-like structures could also be artifacts resulted from colocalization with other cellular structures. The distance between some localization points and their nearest neighbors exceed 200 nm, which is an indication that these structures, if real, are unlikely maintained by basilin oligomerization alone. The manuscript would have to show statistically significant, objective analysis as to convincingly demonstrate the existence of large-size, ordered basilin structures in HEK cells. Otherwise, the biochemistry data can support the oligomerization capability of basilin, but cannot support that basilin rings are formed by basilin oligomerization."

However, judging from the two sets of single-color images, the basilin rings may still have certain degree of overlap with taperin disks. Therefore, these images by themselves cannot rule out the possibility that basilin is interacting with some of the taperins at the periphery of the taperin disks (maybe some post-translational modification?). The reviewer suggests more quantitative analysis of the STORM images: measuring the diameter of the two structures, and compare them to the diameter of the stereocilia measured in EM images. This comparison will be important to support the structural model proposed in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8L</a>. (Optional request) If high quality two-color STORM imaging of basilin and taperin can be obtained, preferably in 3D, the conclusions can be further strengthened."

However, the basilin-taperin case in the same manuscript provides a perfect counter-example: colocalization in the conventional fluorescence images but no direct interaction and distinct morphology in STORM images. The reviewer thus suggests either showing STORM images of these two proteins, or changing the claims in the manuscript."

                    "text": "The manuscript by Zhao et al. provides new insight into the role of Basilin in inner ear hair cell stereocilia morphogenesis and function While mutations in Fam65b (Basilin) had been shown to be responsible for deafness (Diaz-Horta et al., 2014), the role of this protein in hair cells has been unclear. Here the authors combine biochemical (mostly Co-IP), super-resolution microscopy and functional studies to provide insight into <i>FAM65B</i> (renamed \"Basilin\"), a protein previously shown to be linked to inherited forms of deafness but whose molecular and cellular function has remained unknown. The major findings are: 1) basilin is expressed at the taper end of the sensory inner hair cell stereocilia and hair bundles are disorganized in basilin deficient mice; 2) basilin forms head to head and tail to tail oligomers assembled in a ring like pattern at the base of each stereocilia; 3) oligomer formation depends on RhoC (a Rho kinase) binding which also regulates basilin activity. Interestingly, while basilin has been shown to interact with RhoA in neutrophils (Gao et al. 2015), the current work reveals only weak interaction between basilin and RhoA but highly efficient interaction with RhoC. Somewhat surprising, co-IP does not show any interaction between basilin and Cdc42 and Rac1, other Rho family members expressed in hair cells and demonstrated to play a role in cellular patterning, polarization and planar polarity (Grimsley-Myers et al., 2009; Kirjavainen et al. 2015). A major part of this report is based on Co-IPs (12 panels), which assess interaction between basilin and basilin constructs (to reveal interacting domains) with taperin, CLIC5, radixin, whirlin, RhoA, RhoC, Rac1 and Cdc42. Super-resolution microscopy demonstrates distinct localization between taperin and basilin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and linear or circular strings when overexpressed in HEK293 cells. The manuscript is well written and represents a compilation of a large amount of work including the generation of a basilin deficient mouse, immunolocalisation, judicious use of injectoporation with different constructs, co-Ip and Storm microscopy."

Rather a title that encompass the new findings i.e. the role of Basilin in hair cell stereocilia and its regulation by RhoC would be more appropriate."

Since a large portion of the work is based on co-IP, it is important to discuss these findings critically. Co-Ip using a different cell line such as PK1-CL4 cells or pull down assay might reveal different results. In particular, the lack of interaction with CLIC5, Radixin and whirlin is puzzling in part because Taperin has been shown to interact with CLIC5 (Salles et al. 2014). Have the authors also tested interactions with PTPRQ or Myosin VI also present in the tapering region of the stereocilia?"

The paper considerably extends upon the recent paper from Dias-Horta and colleagues showing that a deletion in <i>FAM65B</i> causes deafness in a human family and is required for the normal function and survival of hair cells in the zebrafish. Whilst the extent to which the paper reveals 'insights into the mechanisms by which proteins regulate hair cell function' remains debatable, this is an impressive body of work that certainly provides considerable insight into the ever increasing molecular complexity of the sensory hair bundle."

While the data indicate a potential overlap between the two structures (although this is difficult to say because labeling with the antibody adds to the dimension of the labeled structure), we provide substantial new data supporting the view that Fam65b and taperin do not interact directly. We performed Co-IP experiments in HEK293 cells (already shown in the original study) and in response to the reviewers' comments now also in CL4 cells, which have been used especially by the Bartles and Berryman laboratories to study interactions between proteins important for hair cell function. We provide positive controls demonstrating that we can reveal known interactions (e.g. taperin with CLIC5). In addition, we have carried out yeast-two-hybrid assays to evaluate interactions between Fam65b and taperin but cannot detect any interactions but we identify new interactions (e.g. Fam65b with RhoC). Taken together, the findings suggest that Fam65b does not bind directly to taperin. However, the two proteins might interact via an intermediate protein.

The defects at the taper are consistent with the localization of Fam65b to this region. We provide a quantitative analysis of the morphological phenotypes by grouping the hair cells according to different parameters into four morphological classes. We also provide a quantification of hair bundle polarity defects. Overall, the findings suggest that stereocilia grow and start to form a bundle with a staircase but tapers are abnormally shaped and bundles start to deteriorate before they reach maturity."

Also, we did not mean to imply that the HEK images show that Fam65b forms ring-like structures, just beads-on-a-string like arrangements that would be consistent with oligomerization (as observed in our biochemical analysis). The arrangements of the dots is not random, reproducibly seen in many cells and does not resemble any cellular structure that we have seen for any protein in HEK cells.

This might have to do with the fact that we likely obtained different batches of antibody from the manufacturer. We would also like to point out that the two commercial antibodies used by Diaz-Horta were raised against the N-terminus of Fam65b, which shows 70% similarity with Fam65a and Fam65c. We used an antibody to the C-terminus of Fam65b, which has very low homology with Fam65a/c. Perhaps hair cells express Fam65a, b, c and Diaz-Horta observed with their batch of antibody not only Fam65b. We have revised the text to discuss the discrepancy between the studies and possible explanations for the difference."

For membrane staining, Vybrant DiI, Vybrant DiO, and Vybrant CM-DiI were readily taken up by supporting cells in the cochlea, but not very efficiently by the hair cells themselves; not just the stereocilia bundles, but also the apical membranes in hair cells did not stain significantly. Background was too high with biotin-based membrane staining methods. We were also looking for a good fluorophores coupled to phalloidin that could bleach with our laser illumination set-up (bleaching is critical for STORM), but using commercially available fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin we could not achieve good F-actin staining using STORM. We have more recently approached researchers at other institutions for collaborations to explore other technologies (SIM, STET) but do not yet have access to these instruments. Even without these data, we find that our studies make a substantial contribution and reveal clear differences in the distribution of taperin and Fam65b at the base of stereocilia. The diameter of the structures that we image is in good agreement with the diameter of stereocilia, suggesting localization of Fam65b near the membrane, as depicted in the diagram.

The additional SEM data is fascinating, although it is hard to immediately understand why the thin, tapered region of the stereocilium should get longer in the absence of FAM65B. Whilst the quantitation of the diameters of the FAM65b and taperin staining patterns provide support for the structural model, these numbers are presumably derived from a subset of the FAM65b clusters seen at the base of the stereocilia; the standard errors (?) are small and judging from <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> ring-shaped structures are very much in the minority. Some indication of the criteria used to select the images measured would be useful.</i>"
