Parasites retain a heme biosynthesis pathway but do not require its activity during infection of heme-rich erythrocytes, where they can scavenge host heme to meet metabolic needs. Nevertheless, heme biosynthesis in parasite-infected erythrocytes can be potently stimulated by exogenous 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), resulting in accumulation of the phototoxic intermediate protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). Here we use photodynamic imaging, mass spectrometry, parasite gene disruption, and chemical probes to reveal that vestigial host enzymes in the cytoplasm of <i>Plasmodium</i>-infected erythrocytes contribute to ALA-stimulated heme biosynthesis and that ALA uptake depends on parasite-established permeability pathways. We show that PPIX accumulation in infected erythrocytes can be harnessed for antimalarial chemotherapy using luminol-based chemiluminescence and combinatorial stimulation by low-dose artemisinin to photoactivate PPIX to produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen. This photodynamic strategy has the advantage of exploiting host enzymes refractory to resistance-conferring mutations."

Parasites retain a heme biosynthesis pathway but do not require its activity during infection of heme-rich erythrocytes, where they can scavenge host heme to meet metabolic needs. Nevertheless, heme biosynthesis in parasite-infected erythrocytes can be potently stimulated by exogenous 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), resulting in accumulation of the phototoxic intermediate protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). Here we use photodynamic imaging, mass spectrometry, parasite gene disruption, and chemical probes to reveal that vestigial host enzymes in the cytoplasm of <i>Plasmodium</i>-infected erythrocytes contribute to ALA-stimulated heme biosynthesis and that ALA uptake depends on parasite-established permeability pathways. We show that PPIX accumulation in infected erythrocytes can be harnessed for antimalarial chemotherapy using luminol-based chemiluminescence and combinatorial stimulation by low-dose artemisinin to photoactivate PPIX to produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen. This photodynamic strategy has the advantage of exploiting host enzymes refractory to resistance-conferring mutations."

First, several parasite genes that encode the enzymes used to make heme molecules were deleted. Unexpectedly, these gene deletions did not affect the ability of the infected blood cells to make heme. This result suggested that the parasites do not use their own pathway to produce heme while they are growing in the bloodstream. Sigala et al. then showed that human enzymes involved in making heme, most of which are also found within the infected red blood cells, are still active. These human enzymes provide a parallel pathway that can link up with the final parasite enzyme to generate heme."

This stimulation led to the build-up of an intermediate molecule called PPIX. This intermediate molecule can kill cells when it is exposed to light\u2014a property that is called \u2018phototoxicity\u2019. Sigala et al. showed that treating infected red blood cells with a new combination of non-toxic chemicals that emit light can activate PPIX in the bloodstream and can selectively kill the malaria parasites while leaving uninfected cells intact. These findings suggest a new treatment that could be effective against blood-stage malaria. Furthermore, the parasite will be unable to easily mutate to avoid the effects of this treatment because it relies on human proteins that are already made. Future work is now needed to optimize the dosage and the combination of drugs that could provide such a treatment."

Recent identification of artemisinin-tolerant parasites in southeast Asia, however, has raised concerns that the broad potency of ACTs against all parasite strains may be waning, which could lead to a resurgence in malaria deaths (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dondorp et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ariey et al., 2014</a>).

This pathway was originally proposed to be essential for blood-stage parasite development and thus a potential drug target (<a href=\"#bib52\">Surolia and Padmanaban, 1992</a>), as host heme was thought to be inaccessible for parasite utilization in mitochondria. Recent studies, however, have clarified that de novo heme synthesis is not required by intraerythrocytic parasites and therefore is unlikely to be a viable target for therapeutic inhibition (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nagaraj et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ke et al., 2014</a>). The parasite-encoded ferrochelatase (FC) can be knocked out to ablate heme biosynthesis but parasite growth is unaffected, suggesting that parasites can scavenge host heme to satisfy metabolic requirements during blood-stage infection."

Contrary to simple predictions, genetic disruption of the parasite porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) and coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO) had no effect on the ability of <i>Plasmodium</i>-infected erythrocytes to convert exogenous aminolevulinic acid (ALA) into heme, as monitored by mass spectrometry and photodynamic imaging of porphyrin intermediates. Biochemical fractionation revealed that vestigial host enzymes remaining in the erythrocyte cytoplasm contribute to ALA-stimulated heme biosynthesis, explaining why disruption of parasite enzymes had no effect on biosynthetic flux. We used small-molecule probes to show that ALA uptake by erythrocytes, which are normally impermeable to ALA, requires the parasite nutrient-acquisition pathways established after invasion. Finally, we show that latent host enzyme activity can be exploited for antimalarial photodynamic therapy (PDT) using (1) ALA to stimulate production of the phototoxic intermediate protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), (2) luminol-based chemiluminescence to photoactivate PPIX cytotoxicity within infected erythrocytes, and (3) luminol stimulation by combinatorial low-dose artemisinin."

Exogenous ALA bypasses this step and stimulates biosynthetic flux, leading to accumulation of the final intermediate, PPIX, since conversion of PPIX to heme by FC becomes rate limiting (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kennedy et al., 1990</a>). PPIX is fluorescent (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and its cellular accumulation can be directly visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a phenomenon called \u2018photodynamic imaging\u2019 that has been exploited for visualizing cancerous tumor boundaries during surgical resection (<a href=\"#bib5\">Celli et al., 2010</a>)."

Although the origin and physiological significance of this motion remain unknown, hemozoin dynamics serve as an internal biomarker of food vacuole integrity and parasite viability (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sigala and Goldberg, 2014</a>). Hemozoin motion in untreated parasites was unaffected by exposure to light that overlaps the excitation wavelength of PPIX (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1, 2</a>). In contrast, the hemozoin dynamics in ALA-treated parasites were rapidly ablated by light (<a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3, 4</a>). Ultra-structural analysis by electron microscopy revealed a loss of electron density within the digestive vacuole of ALA-treated and illuminated parasites (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting disruption of the food vacuole membrane and outward diffusion of the vacuolar protein contents. These changes are consistent with a photodynamic mechanism of PPIX-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species that cause pleiotropic cytotoxic damage, including loss of lipid bilayer integrity."

Whereas untreated parasite cultures grew normally in the presence of light, the growth of ALA-treated cultures was strongly attenuated by light (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), consistent with a prior report (<a href=\"#bib46\">Smith and Kain, 2004</a>). Microscopic examination by blood smear revealed that ALA-treated cultures predominantly contained karyolytic and pyknotic parasites (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), indicative of widespread cell death. The photosensitivity of parasite growth in ALA was fully rescued by 50 \u00b5M succinylacetone (SA), an ALA dehydratase (ALAD) inhibitor shown in previous work to substantially reduce PPIX biosynthesis from ALA in parasite-infected erythrocytes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nagaraj et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ke et al., 2014</a>). This chemical rescue confirmed that parasite photosensitivity in ALA requires biosynthetic conversion of ALA to PPIX."

Prior work indicated that the parasite FC gene could be knocked out, resulting in a complete ablation of de novo heme synthesis but with no effect on parasite growth (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nagaraj et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ke et al., 2014</a>). This observation provided strong evidence that parasites do not require heme biosynthesis for growth in erythrocytes, where they can presumably scavenge abundant host heme to meet metabolic needs. We therefore reasoned that upstream enzymes in the parasite-encoded heme biosynthesis pathway should also be amenable to genetic disruption and that such ablations would block production of PPIX from exogenous ALA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and thus prevent parasite photosensitivity."

Doxycycline inhibits the prokaryotic translation machinery of the apicoplast, which blocks replication of the small apicoplast genome, prevents organelle segregation, and results in unviable apicoplast-deficient parasite progeny (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dahl et al., 2006</a>). The lethal effects of doxycycline, however, can be chemically rescued by IPP, which enables parasites to make essential isoprenoids despite apicoplast disruption. This rescue leads to a stable metabolic state in which parasites lack the intact organelle such that nuclear-encoded proteins ordinarily targeted to the apicoplast become stranded in small vesicles (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</a>). We confirmed apicoplast loss in doxycycline and IPP-treated parasites by using microscopy to verify disrupted apicoplast targeting of the nuclear-encoded ALAD enzyme (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), PCR to confirm loss of the small apicoplast genome (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), and western blot (WB) to visualize disruption of post-translational processing of ALAD (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). Despite apicoplast disruption, these parasites retained their capacity for heme biosynthesis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and remained fully photosensitive in ALA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Together with the gene disruption results above, these observations strongly suggested that parasite-infected erythrocytes have a parallel biosynthetic pathway that bypasses functional disruption of the parasite enzymes targeted to the apicoplast and cytoplasm."

During human erythropoiesis, precursor reticulocytes carry out prolific heme biosynthesis, but this activity is absent in mature erythrocytes due to loss of mitochondria and their constituent heme biosynthesis enzymes, including ALAS and FC (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ponka, 1997</a>). Proteomic studies have confirmed that mature erythrocytes retain the cytosolic enzymes (ALAD, PBGD, uroporphyrinogen synthase [UROS], and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase [UROD]) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pasini et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">D'alessandro et al., 2010</a>), but this vestigial pathway is ordinarily quiescent due to the lack of ALA synthesis or uptake in erythrocytes. We hypothesized that exogenous ALA taken up by parasite-infected erythrocytes might stimulate the latent activity of these cytosolic human enzymes, resulting in biosynthetic flux through this truncated host pathway and production of downstream tetrapyrrole intermediates that could be taken up by the parasite via hemoglobin import or other mechanisms and converted into heme within the parasite mitochondrion."

To dissect these parallel pathways and test whether the parasite pathway alone, in the absence of host enzymes, can support heme biosynthesis from ALA, we fractionated parasite-infected erythrocytes using saponin to selectively permeabilize host cell membranes while leaving parasite membranes intact (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Under these conditions, soluble erythrocyte proteins can be washed away to leave the intact live parasite natively embedded within the resulting erythrocyte ghost (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Parasites treated in this fashion remain metabolically active for 5\u20136 hr or longer, retain a membrane potential, accumulate fluorescent dyes such as MitoTracker Red (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>), and carry out DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Izumo et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cobbold et al., 2011</a>).

We failed to detect biosynthesis of heme, PPIX, or CPP in fractionated asexual and sexual blood-stage parasites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), suggesting that the apicoplast-localized portion of the parasite heme biosynthesis pathway is largely or completely inactive during blood-stage infection."

The cobA protein catalyzes conversion of the heme biosynthesis intermediate uroporphyrinogen III into the red fluorescent products sirohydrochlorin and trimethylpyrrocorphin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and has been shown to function when heterologously expressed in bacteria (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), yeast, and mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sattler et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wildt and Deuschle, 1999</a>). We targeted a cobA-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein to the apicoplast in ALA-treated parasites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) but were unable to detect any red fluorescence in this organelle indicative of cobA-mediated conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to the fluorescent products. This result suggests that parasite enzymes targeted to this organelle are inactive in both asexual and sexual blood stages (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). We also noted that growth of \u2206FC parasites (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ke et al., 2014</a>), which would be expected to accumulate PPIX during native pathway activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), was insensitive to light in the absence of ALA (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These observations suggest that heme biosynthesis in blood-stage <i>P. falciparum</i> parasites is only operative when exogenous ALA is present to stimulate PPIX production by remnant host enzymes in the erythrocyte cytoplasm, with subsequent PPIX uptake and conversion to heme by FC in the parasite mitochondrion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Despite access to abundant host heme during intraerythrocytic infection, parasites retain a complete heme biosynthesis pathway that was regarded for two decades as essential and a potential drug target (<a href=\"#bib52\">Surolia and Padmanaban, 1992</a>). Our work and recent studies have now successfully disrupted four of the eight pathway enzymes, providing firm evidence that de novo heme synthesis is dispensable during blood-stage infection. These data strongly suggest that parasites have mechanisms to scavenge host heme to meet metabolic needs and clarify that heme biosynthesis is not a viable target for classical drug inhibition (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nagaraj et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ke et al., 2014</a>)."

This inactivity may reflect the low availability of the succinyl-CoA precursor due to limited tricarboxylic acid cycle flux (<a href=\"#bib29\">MacRae et al., 2013</a>) and additional regulatory mechanisms that suppress the activity of apicoplast-targeted enzymes during blood-stage parasite development, such as feedback inhibition by host heme or active-site inhibition by endogenous metabolites (<a href=\"#bib36\">Park et al., 2015</a>),. The functional quiescence of this specific biosynthetic pathway, despite expression of the constituent enzymes, may reflect a general survival strategy and adaptation by parasites to closely match their metabolic requirements with the nutritional availability of specific host environments, such as those previously described for parasite acquisition of fatty acids (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yu et al., 2008</a>). Indeed, prior studies suggest that the parasite heme synthesis pathway is required for development within the mosquito and human liver (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nagaraj et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ke et al., 2014</a>). These stages involve host environments with lower heme availability compared with erythrocytes and in which parasite heme requirements appear to be elevated due to enhanced reliance on mitochondrial electron transport for ATP synthesis (<a href=\"#bib55\">van Dooren et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sigala and Goldberg, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sturm et al., 2015</a>). A prior study reported that blood-stage <i>P. falciparum</i> parasites adopt distinct physiological states in vivo, including a state with heightened oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial activity that may arise during host starvation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Daily et al., 2007</a>).

This biosynthetic activity requires the <i>Plasmodium</i> FC but not the upstream enzymes in the parasite pathway. Indeed, knock-out of the <i>Plasmodium</i> FC prevented conversion of PPIX to heme (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ke et al., 2014</a>), but our disruption of the parasite PBGD and CPO genes, as well as the entire apicoplast organelle, had no effect on ALA-stimulated heme synthesis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Our work resolves this paradox by identifying a latent contribution to heme biosynthesis in parasite-infected erythrocytes from vestigial host enzymes remaining in the erythrocyte cytoplasm. Since erythrocytes lack mitochondria, they are missing the initial and terminal pathway enzymes, are unable to synthesize ALA, and thus retain only a truncated and normally inactive heme synthesis pathway. Analytical studies have reported that human serum contains 0.1\u20130.2 \u00b5M ALA (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>), but the low permeability of the erythrocyte membrane to ALA means that extracellular ALA is largely inaccessible to vestigial host enzymes within uninfected erythrocytes."

After uptake, ALA can be metabolized by vestigial human enzymes within the oxygen-rich erythrocyte cytoplasm to produce PPIX that can be converted to heme by FC within the parasite mitochondrion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Thus, the 0.2 \u00b5M ALA natively present in human serum may be sufficient to stimulate low-level heme biosynthesis within parasites in vivo. Indeed, we detect <sup>13</sup>C-labeled PPIX in parasites grown in 1 \u00b5M 5-[<sup>13</sup>C<sub>4</sub>]-ALA in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplementary 1</a>), supporting a model that serum ALA stimulates heme biosynthesis during malaria infection in vivo. Such activity, however, is not required to support blood-stage parasite growth. We note that prior work suggested a role for remnant host enzymes in heme biosynthesis by malaria parasites, but this prior proposal differed by positing that human enzymes such as ALAD were somehow imported and active within the parasite cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib34\">Padmanaban et al., 2007</a>)."

We have shown that luminol-based chemiluminescence, when stimulated by combinatorial delivery of low-dose 4-iodophenol or artemisinin, can circumvent the conventional PDT requirement for external light and potently ablate parasite growth (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We note that ALA, luminol, and DHA have excellent toxicity profiles, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and have each been used clinically (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bissonnette et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dalton et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gordi and Lepist, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Larkin and Gannicliffe, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wachowska et al., 2011</a>). These results suggest the possibility of including ALA and luminol with therapeutic doses of artemisinin (or its clinical derivatives) as a novel form of artemisinin combination therapy for treating malaria. Multidrug-resistant parasites remain susceptible to this photodynamic strategy, which relies on host enzyme activity outside the genetic control of parasites and thus is refractory to the development of resistance-conferring mutations. This CL-PDT strategy may also be effective against other intraerythrocytic parasites, such as <i>Babesia</i>. As for any new therapy suggested by in vitro studies, additional in vivo experiments will be required to optimize treatment regimens for our proposed therapy and to confirm efficacy and safety."

Both cultures (\u00b1TMP) were permitted to lyse and reinvade fresh erythrocytes overnight. The following morning, parasites were placed in 200 \u00b5M ALA as early rings, incubated for 8 hr at 37\u00b0C, and imaged by live parasite microscopy as described above. Alternatively, asynchronous wild-type 3D7 parasites were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 \u00b5M furosemide for 1 hr to block nutrient-acquisition pathways, followed by the addition of 500 \u00b5M ALA and further incubation for 8 hr. Parasites were then imaged by live parasite microscopy as described above."

They also showed that host enzymes in the erythrocyte cytoplasm could complement genetic knockouts in the parasite's pathway. With ALA stimulation, a later step in heme biosynthesis become rate limiting, and the build-up of the redox active substrate for this step can inhibit parasite growth. The authors then devised a three-compoent mixture of ALA, luminol, and dihydroartemisinin that potently inhibited parasite growth when used in photodynamic therapy."

Formation of ALA is the rate-limiting step in heme biosynthesis, so added ALA bypasses normal heme biosynthetic regulation.

Prior work had also established that PPIX produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) when irradiated, and the cytotoxic effects of ROS generation has been exploited as a photodynamic therapy for cancer cells. In accord with this precedent, irradiation of parasite cultures treated with ALA displayed a significant growth defect. The authors explore the mechanism of growth inhibition in considerable detail and establish that host enzymes are largely responsible for PPIX formation and that parasites have an ALA uptake mechanism. They then go on to develop a photodynamic therapy for malaria using earlier findings about luminol enhancement from cancer chemotherapy and introducing artemisinin with its obvious relevance to malaria therapy.

The assays are in vitro, and the concentrations (100 \u00b5M ALA and 750 \u00b5M luminol) seem very high. The criteria for malaria therapies, which need to be effective in resource poor settings, include: single dose, low cost (preferably less than $1), efficacy in all stages, and safety for pregnant women and children. Recently important articles on just such therapies have appeared (Nature) as have articles on significant host targets (Science). There is a high bar for innovative and useful malaria therapies.

The authors show conclusively that the parasite heme biosynthesis is not essential through evaluation of several genetic knockouts in the pathway (e.g. porphbilinogen deaminase and cytosolic corproporphyrinogen III oxidase). They demonstrate that heme biosynthesis is stimulated by addition of exogenouse 5-aminolevulinic acids (ALA) and they show through fractionation and 13C labeling that host red cell enzymes and not parasite enzymes are responsible for metabolism of exogenous ALA to generate protoprphyrin IX (PPIX). They also show that parasite remodeling of the host cell is necessary to permeabilize the red cells to ALA uptake, thus there is also an important contribution of parasite expressed proteins to the ability of ALA to be utilized by the infected red cell. The identification of the role of red cell enzymes explains the paradox that <i>Plasmodium</i> ferrochelatase is essential while the upstream heme biosynthetic enzymes from the parasite are not. Finally they show that combinations of ALA, luminol and an activator such as artemesinin can be used to kill the parasites in vitro in the absence of light stimulation. (PPIX generates cytotoxic reactive oxygen species when photo-illuminated). Photodynamic therapy has been explored as a mechanism to kill cancer cells treated with ALA. As conventional photodynamic therapy would require a light source and not be practical for treatment of malaria, the authors used a combination of luminol activated by an oxygen radical generator (e.g. Artemisinin) to demonstrate that parasites are killed by these in combination with ALA."

The work is very carefully done and uses a strong combination of approaches that lead to clear conclusive results. The possibility that photodynamic therapy might be used to treat malaria is also intriguing and the use of artemisinin as the oxygen radical source was very clever and novel. The study provides a mechanism for potentially rescuing the value of artemisinin even in \u201cresistant\u201d parasites. This paper clearly advances in a very significant way our understanding of heme biosynthesis in the malaria parasite and it provides a provocative potential new method for parasite treatment.

The assays are in vitro, and the concentrations (100 \u00b5M ALA and 750 \u00b5M luminol) seem very high. The criteria for malaria therapies, which need to be effective in resource poor settings, include: single dose, low cost (preferably less than $1), efficacy in all stages, and safety for pregnant women and children. Recently important articles on just such therapies have appeared (Nature) as have articles on significant host targets (Science). There is a high bar for innovative and useful malaria therapies.
