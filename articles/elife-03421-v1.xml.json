To critically examine the widely held assumption that reduced ER glutathione fuels disulfide reduction, we expressed a modified form of a cytosolic glutathione-degrading enzyme, ChaC1, in the ER lumen. ChaC1<sup>CtoS</sup> purged the ER of glutathione eliciting the expected kinetic defect in oxidation of an ER-localized glutathione-coupled Grx1-roGFP2 optical probe, but had no effect on the disulfide editing-dependent maturation of the LDL receptor or the reduction-dependent degradation of misfolded alpha-1 antitrypsin. Furthermore, glutathione depletion had no measurable effect on induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR); a sensitive measure of ER protein folding homeostasis. These findings challenge the importance of reduced ER glutathione and suggest the existence of alternative electron donor(s) that maintain the reductive capacity of the ER."

To critically examine the widely held assumption that reduced ER glutathione fuels disulfide reduction, we expressed a modified form of a cytosolic glutathione-degrading enzyme, ChaC1, in the ER lumen. ChaC1<sup>CtoS</sup> purged the ER of glutathione eliciting the expected kinetic defect in oxidation of an ER-localized glutathione-coupled Grx1-roGFP2 optical probe, but had no effect on the disulfide editing-dependent maturation of the LDL receptor or the reduction-dependent degradation of misfolded alpha-1 antitrypsin. Furthermore, glutathione depletion had no measurable effect on induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR); a sensitive measure of ER protein folding homeostasis. These findings challenge the importance of reduced ER glutathione and suggest the existence of alternative electron donor(s) that maintain the reductive capacity of the ER."

However, the lack of glutathione had no effect on the folding of a large protein with 30 disulfide bonds, many of which need to be edited at one time or another for the protein to fold correctly. The destruction of a poorly folded protein, via a process that also needs this protein's disulfide bonds to be broken down, was also not affected by a lack of reduced glutathione in the endoplasmic reticulum."

Dedicated enzymatic machinery, consisting of disulfide exchange catalysts of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) class, rapidly introduces disulfide bonds into nascent polypeptide chains. The recycling of PDIs back to their oxidized form is mediated by upstream oxidases, exemplified by ERO1 and back-up enzymes, such as PRDX4 and VKOR that exploit O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and vitamin K epoxide, respectively, as downstream electron acceptors. Defects in components of this electron transfer chain markedly affect protein folding homeostasis in the ER (<a href=\"#bib32\">Sevier and Kaiser, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Rutkevich and Williams, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Zito, 2013</a>)."

This editing entails attack by the reduced N-terminal cysteine of PDI's active site on the misplaced disulfide following resolution of the mixed disulfide. The latter proceeds either by way of a zero-sum re-shuffling process entailing an attacking second reduced cysteine in the client polypeptide, which releases reduced PDI and establishes a new disulfide, or by a net reductive process involving an attack on the mixed disulfide by the C-terminal active site cysteine, in which PDI \u2018escapes\u2019 in its oxidized form, having reduced its client protein (<a href=\"#bib37\">Walker et al., 1996</a>). Both mechanisms require a pool of reduced PDI, the maintenance of which is not trivial, given the oxidative environment in the ER. This challenge is especially great in case of the second mechanism, which is a set-up for iterative cycles of net oxidation-reduction-oxidation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Schwaller et al., 2003</a>)."

To examine this further, we first compared the rate of re-oxidation of ER-localized roGFP2 with that of ER-localized Grx1-roGFP2 following a reductive pulse of dithiothreitol (DTT) and its washout. At steady-state both probes were highly oxidized and both were similarly reduced by the DTT pulse.

Introduction of the C104A; C133A human ERO1L (ERO1*), expressed from a plasmid tagged with the CD2 surface marker indeed modestly activated the UPR, whether measured in cells stably expressing the CHOP::GFP transcriptional reporter (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, reflected in the higher GFP levels of cells co-expressing the CD2 marker which tags the ERO1*-expressing cells, panels 2, 4, and 7) or an XBP1::Venus splicing reporter (<a href=\"#bib16\">Iwawaki et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, co-expression of active ChaC1<sup>CtoS</sup> had no evident synergistic effect with ERO1* on UPR activity beyond that observed with the enzymatically inactive E116Q mutant enzyme. This is evident by first noting that in this co-transfection experiment most ERO1* expressing cells (CD2 positive) are also co-expressing the Cherry-tagged ChaC1<sup>CtoS</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, panels 3 and 6) and then noting that the relationship between ERO1* expression (for which CD2 is a surrogate) and the CHOP::GFP signal is indistinguishable in cells co-expressing wild-type and enzymatically inactive ChaC1<sup>CtoS</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> panels 4 and 7). Similarly, the co-expression of ERO1* does not impart sensitivity to active ChaC1, as reflected by the observation that CHOP::GFP levels are unaffected by ChaC1<sup>CtoS</sup> in these double positive cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> panels 5 and 8).

More surprising was the lack of any measurable effect of glutathione depletion on processes that require a pool of reduced PDI enzymes: the disulfide shuffling-dependent maturation of nascent LDL-R and the degradation of a folding incompetent mutant NHK-A1AT. Furthermore, depletion of ER glutathione was without effect on two sensitive, broad-spectrum UPR reporters, arguing that glutathione is indeed dispensable to a broad range of processes required for protein folding homeostasis in the ER of cultured mammalian cells."

However, the extent of ER glutathione depletion attained by this genetic manipulation is unclear and, given the essential role of cellular glutathione to yeast growth, may have been limited by toxicity. Similar reservations apply to the use of enzyme inhibitors, such as BSO, which subject the cell to the consequences of glutathione depletion in other compartments where it has an essential role (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kumar et al., 2011</a>), but whose effect on the ER pools of glutathione may be partial."

In vitro the re-oxidation of Grx1-roGFP2 is half-maximal at 18 \u00b5M glutathione (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Thus, the abolition of the kinetic advantage of Grx1-roGFP2 over roGFP2 in cells expressing enzymatically active ChaC1 argues that, despite the enzyme's relative low affinity for its substrate (in the millimolar range, <a href=\"#bib20\">Kumar et al., 2012</a>; and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>), glutathione levels were purged to micromolar levels by the high concentration of the enzyme. This conclusion is also supported by the effects of ER ChaC1 on total cellular glutathione levels: At similar levels of expression, cytosolic ChaC1 led to near complete depletion of total cellular glutathione, whereas ER ChaC1 had a more modest effect on total cellular pools. Given the 10-fold greater volume of the cytosol over the ER (<a href=\"#bib34\">Stefan et al., 1987</a>), the aforementioned observations indicate substantially higher local concentration of ER vs cytosolic ChaC1. Thus, the preservation of total cellular glutathione levels in cells expressing high levels of ChaC1 in their ER confirms that transport of glutathione into the ER, from its site of synthesis in the cytosol, is slow (as suggested by <a href=\"#bib21\">Kumar et al., 2011</a>), and therefore, that depletion of ER stores by ChaC1 is profound."

However, it is possible that despite seemingly rapid equilibration of glutathione to protein thiol redox, the kinetics are insufficient to render glutathione essential and that other, even faster processes, maintain an adequate pool of reduced and oxidized PDIs in the mammalian ER, with glutathione following passively. It is noteworthy, in this vein, that ERO1-deficient cells, with compromised ER thiol oxidative power, have an elevated ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione (<a href=\"#bib1\">Appenzeller-Herzog et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Rutkevich and Williams, 2012</a>). It has been speculated, reasonably, that this reflects the action of an alternative oxidative pathway that kicks-in when the major oxidases are compromised and exploits oxidized glutathione to couple to protein thiol oxidation. However, our finding that ER glutathione depletion does not further compromise protein thiol oxidation kinetics in oxidase-deficient cells suggests that here too glutathione follows passively the rearrangements in redox pathways and does not participate actively in their implementation."

These observations, which fall short of directly indicting glutathione in reducing ER disulfides, nonetheless argue for participation of glutathione in a shared economy of reducing equivalents across the ER membrane. Prolonged (48 hr) depletion of glutathione by high concentrations of BSO (1 mM) synergize with ER hyperoxidation to degrade cell viability (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hansen et al., 2012</a>). Further support for the idea of a shared economy of glutathione is provided by the phenotype of yeast over-expressing a plasma membrane glutathione transporter HGT1. Glutathione over-load in these cells compromises protein folding in the ER and triggers an unfolded protein response, the basis of which appears to be unregulated re-cycling of PDI from its oxidized to its reduced state imposed by the excessive glutathione (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kumar et al., 2011</a>). While our state of ignorance in regard to the genes responsible for glutathione transport into the yeast ER preclude assigning a role to luminal glutathione in this consequences of cellular glutathione overload, the observations of Kumar et al. clearly argue that glutathione may participate in ER redox."

Where indicated, the glutathione synthesis inhibitor buthionine-sulfoxide (BSO, 100 \u00b5M, 20 hr) was added before the pulse-chase labeling. Purified protein intensities were quantified using ImageJ software. Images of gels were scaled to fit the page dimensions."

This paper uses an elegant approach to test this assumption directly. By expressing specifically in the ER a glutathione-degrading enzyme the authors assess the effect on various well established assays of folding, maturation and quality control. Surprisingly, none of the processes examined were affected by the loss of glutathione."
