The first step in sensing an odor relies on the peripheral nerves of the olfactory epithelium.

By establishing that neural crest cells are involved in the development of a substantial proportion of olfactory sensory neurons, this work sets the stage for future studies of olfactory nerve growth and regeneration. It may also assist researchers working on anosmia (the inability to smell)."

Whereas placodes form the sense organs (nose, ears, and lens) of the head and contribute to neuronal portions of cranial ganglia, the glia are solely neural crest derived (<a href=\"#bib34\">Northcutt and Gans, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baker and Bronner-Fraser, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barraud et al., 2010</a>). Sensory neurons are the primary functional players of the olfactory epithelium and have long been thought to be similar to neurons of the ear or eye. The latter arise within the developing sensory structures, the otic placode and neural retina, respectively. By analogy, the olfactory epithelium arises from the olfactory placode, a swathe of thickened ectoderm that initially resides within the anteriormost portion of the neural tube and subsequently moves laterally within the plane of the ectoderm. These cells invaginate to form the olfactory vesicle, which in turn becomes encapsulated by neural crest cells that form the surrounding nasal capsule (<a href=\"#bib35\">Osumi-Yamashita et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Le Douarin and Kalcheim, 1999</a>)."

Within the olfactory epithelium, there are two predominant types of olfactory sensory neurons: ciliated and microvillous neurons. These differ in roles, receptors, location, and patterns of innervation. Whereas more basally located ciliated sensory neurons detect volatile odorants, more apically located microvillous sensory neurons can detect pheromones, nucleotides, and/or amino acids, depending on the species (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buck, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sato and Suzuki, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hansen and Zielinski, 2005</a>)."

Recent literature demonstrates that olfactory ensheathing glia, nonneuronal supporting cells previously assumed to derive from the olfactory epithelium, are actually neural crest derived (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barraud et al., 2010</a>). These findings are consistent with the neural crest origin of all other peripheral glia (<a href=\"#bib52\">Woodhoo and Sommer, 2008</a>). In neuronal lineages, there has been considerable controversy over the cell type of origin. As one example, some studies (<a href=\"#bib51\">Whitlock et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Forni et al., 2011</a>) have suggested that neural crest cells give rise to GnRH cells of the terminal nerve, which is close to though not part of the olfactory nerve and epithelium. However, many other studies refute this notion and support a placodal origin for GnRH cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schwanzel-Fukuda and Pfaff, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wray et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dubois et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Palevitch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Metz and Wray, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sabado et al., 2012</a>). Within the olfactory epithelium itself, <a href=\"#bib22\">Harden et al. (2012)</a> recently examined the interactions of Sox10:eGFP-positive cells with six4b:mCherry-expressing placodal precursors in zebrafish. The authors interpreted their negative results to indicate a lack of contribution of neural crest cells to the olfactory epithelium. However, using the same Sox10:eGFP line, here we definitively demonstrate the neural crest origin of microvillous neurons within the olfactory epithelium."

Interestingly, we find that neural crest gives rise to microvillous, but not ciliated, sensory neurons in the developing olfactory epithelium. Specifically, we demonstrate that a neurogenin1 (Ngn1) reporter and Sox10 protein are expressed in the subset of neural crest-derived nasal cavity cells that undergo dynamic ingression into the olfactory epithelium to form microvillous neurons. If the neural crest is ablated, the olfactory epithelium cannot compensate for the loss of microvillous neurons. Finally, we show that the neural crest specifier gene Sox10 is required for microvillous neurogenesis as these cells are ingressing into the olfactory epithelium. These results definitively demonstrate for the first time a Sox10-dependent neural crest origin for microvillous sensory neurons that take residence within the placode-derived olfactory epithelium."

To determine if Sox10 is required specifically during microvillous neurogenesis, as opposed to only during its well-established earlier role in neural crest specification/migration, we took advantage of a new photocleavable morpholino system (Gene Tools, LLC; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tallafuss et al., 2012</a>). First, using a second translation-blocking antisense morpholino targeting Sox10 (previously used in <a href=\"#bib14\">Dutton et al., 2001a</a>), we confirmed our previous results that Sox10 was necessary for microvillous neuron formation (data not shown). We then utilized a sense photo-morpholino specifically targeted to the second antisense morpholino and containing a photocleavable moiety. Coinjection of the two oligonucleotides sequestered the antisense Sox10 morpholino, rendering it inactive until illumination at 365 nm resulted in cleavage of the photo-morpholino and release of the antisense morpholino. This process allowed for the inhibition of Sox10 protein production from a specific time point onward and had the advantage of leaving Sox10-related processes such as early neural crest development intact. In addition, this experimental setup allowed for the injection of a single oligonucleotide cocktail into both control (not photocleaved) and experimental (photocleaved) embryos, reducing the variability inherent in morpholino-based experiments."

In addition, some uninjected embryos were illuminated to control for any effects of UV light (data not shown). While control embryos developed normal numbers and organization of olfactory sensory neurons at 38 hpf (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,A'</a>) and 54 hpf (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), knockdown of Sox10 expression at 24 hpf specifically impeded microvillous neuron formation and organization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,B'</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Knockdown at the earlier 17.5 hpf time point had an even more pronounced effect (data not shown), since it allowed more time for degradation of existing Sox10 protein before the start of ingression. Importantly, the later 24 hpf time point of photocleavage occurs well after neural crest cells have populated the nasal cavity, and results from that experiment decouple microvillous neurogenesis from earlier, critical roles of Sox10 in neural crest development and migration. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Sox10 is required for ingression/differentiation from the nasal cavity into the olfactory epithelium to generate microvillous neurons."

Our conclusions are derived from several complementary lines of experimentation ranging from live imaging of migration to fate mapping via photoconversion and laser ablation to morpholino knockdown at specific time points. The cumulative results demonstrate that neural crest cells migrate anteriorly to form the mesenchymal nasal cavity. A subset of these cells expresses Ngn1 and upregulates Sox10 to high levels during ingression into the olfactory epithelium to form microvillous neurons. Laser ablation data confirm that the neural crest contribution is necessary for microvillous neurogenesis and that the olfactory placode is unable to compensate for the loss of this precursor population."

Therefore, there is no general loss of neurogenesis in the olfactory placode but rather a microvillous-specific phenotype. An observed slight decrease in ciliated neuron numbers and thinning of projections in morpholino-treated embryos, similar to that seen in the laser ablation experiments, is likely a secondary effect due to the absence of normally adjacent microvillous neurons. Ciliated neurons largely recover by 48 hpf development, whereas neural crest\u2013derived microvillous neurons do not."

Interpretation of these experiments is made difficult by the fact that the Wnt1 marker is not entirely neural crest specific, as it is also expressed in the dorsal neural tube, otic placode, and several other regions (<a href=\"#bib39\">Riccomagno et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Freyer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Valenta et al., 2011</a>). In zebrafish, <a href=\"#bib22\">Harden et al. (2012)</a> suggest the idea of a possible neural crest contribution to olfactory ensheathing glia but not to sensory neurons, although they provide no direct evidence to substantiate this possibility. Here, by using photoconversion of Sox10-expressing neural crest cells, we were able to unequivocally follow individual neural crest cells from their site of origin in the dorsal neural tube to their ingression into the olfactory epithelium and differentiation into microvillous sensory neurons."

Hence, analysis of their lineage, paths of differentiation, and molecular determinants may provide important insights into general mechanisms of self-renewal. Since processes of renewal may be lineage-dependent, understanding the embryonic origins of different classes of olfactory neurons has distinct value. In the case of placode-derived ciliated sensory neurons, their replenishment throughout the lifespan likely occurs within the mature olfactory vesicle. Similarly, there may be a subpopulation of microvillous sensory neurons derived from the olfactory vesicle. Consistent with this possibility, we see a small number of microvillous neurons that are Sox10:eGFP-negative. Alternatively, given our evidence of large-scale neural crest contribution to microvillous sensory neurons, it is intriguing to consider that their replacement during adulthood may take place via a latent neural crest stem cell population derived from the nasal cavity."

These data not only contradict existing dogma but open new avenues for better understanding sensory neurogenesis in the embryo and renewal in the adult. During vertebrate evolution, a myriad of changes have occurred in olfaction, including the emergence of the vomeronasal organ, which fish and birds appear to lack. Given the diverse nature of olfaction across species, it will be interesting to examine possible neural crest contributions from a comparative perspective as new lineage tracing tools become available in other model systems."

This conclusion is based on a combination of live time-lapse filming, fate mapping Sox10-labelled cells (both generically and targeted in a number of ways), and laser ablation of Sox10 neural crest cells. In addition, the authors show that Sox10 levels increase during development and that knockdown of this transcription factor either by conventional morpholino or by a clever photo-activatable morpholino (to control the timing) leads to loss of olfactory microvillous cells. Overall the study is very well done, nicely illustrated, and the authors' arguments are generally well supported."

Hence, data has pointed towards a role for neural crest in contributing glia and neurons to the OE. This current paper convincingly locks down the neural crest origins of the specific microvillous population in zebrafish. Because studies have been done with multiple experimental systems it would be important to see a coherent set of experiments in one system and/or address the possibility of differences between species. That there may be a difference in the olfactory system of different vertebrate classes might make sense if there is a marked difference in the function of this system in air and water. For example, are the olfactory ensheathing cells in zebrafish also of neural crest origin? The authors might have that information in their data set and it would greatly enhance the value of the story to have it in the paper. It would go a long way towards confirming the lineage relationships that they see are consistent with mouse and chick results, which they imply in the paper. Ideally the authors should test at least some of their observations in a \u201cdry\u201d vertebrate (mouse or chick), but if this is not possible, the paper should be made very explicitly relevant to zebrafish in the title and abstract, as well as in the paper, to accommodate this possibility and to avoid confusing readers."

There are certainly important anatomical differences between fish and mammals, as mammals have a vomeronasal organ whereas fish do not, and the story in birds is ambiguous. Even within these structures there may be neuronal heterogeneity, which makes it critical to study these events in multiple species to increase understanding of the lineage relationships. Currently, mammalian experiments are severely limited by the lack of neural crest-specific labeling and the difficulty of live cell tracking. As new imaging technology becomes available in the future, we hope to overcome these technical limitations and gain new insights into these questions."

                    "text": "Unfortunately, the turnover of photoconverted Dendra2 limits the number of days that cells can be tracked. For this reason, we were unable to follow our labeled cells for long enough to observe cell bodies along the olfactory nerve. Further complicating this analysis, there are few/no good markers for glial cells in zebrafish. GFAP, a general glial marker in zebrafish, has a transgenic line described as having faint expression in some (unspecified, not shown) cells of the olfactory placode (Bernardos & Raymond, 2006), and a previously used anti-GFAP antibody in our hands is inconclusive or negative in olfactory labeling. Therefore, we are limited by the reagents available to test this interesting possibility. We are in the process of developing new transgenic tools that may allow this question to be answered, but the timeline precludes inclusion in this manuscript. As suggested, we have altered our title and abstract to make it clear that our data speak to sensory neurons specifically in the zebrafish model system. In addition, we have now included an additional neuronal marker (HuC/D) to further identify Sox10:GFP+ olfactory neurons."
