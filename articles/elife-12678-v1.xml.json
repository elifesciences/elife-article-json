However, too wide or too narrow generalization is linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous research suggests that interactions between the dopaminergic system and the hippocampus may play a role in generalization, but whether and how the degree of generalization can be modulated via these pathways is currently unknown. Here, we addressed this question in humans using pharmacology, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and computational modeling. Blocking dopamine D2-receptors (D2R) altered generalization behavior as revealed by an increased kurtosis of the generalization gradient, and a decreased width of model-derived generalization parameters. Moreover, D2R-blockade modulated similarity-based responses in the hippocampus and decreased midbrain-hippocampal connectivity, which in turn correlated with individual differences in generalization. These results suggest that dopaminergic activity in the hippocampus may relate to the degree of generalization and highlight a potential target for treatment."

After experiencing the rat and noise together on multiple occasions, Little Albert eventually began to cry whenever the rat appeared. However, he also showed a similar response to a number of other white furry objects, including a rabbit and even a fur coat. By applying knowledge about a familiar object to other similar stimuli, humans and other animals avoid having to learn about each and every stimulus from scratch. However, this stimulus generalization is only effective if it occurs to the correct degree: under- or over-generalization (as shown by Little Albert) can lead to behaviors that are less than optimal."

A key aspect of generalization is the degree to which learned associations are applied to novel stimuli: the width of generalization. Generalization relieves individuals from having to learn outcome predictions for every single stimulus from scratch before using them to guide behavior. However, generalizing too widely can be maladaptive because it leads to the indiscriminate approach (or avoidance) of stimuli that are unlikely to be associated with reward (or punishment). Indeed, aberrant generalization is implicated in several neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, depression, and drug abuse (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dunsmoor and Paz, 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib15\">Gotlib and Joormann, 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib29\">Lissek et al., 2014b</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib31\">Lucantonio et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib37\">Moustafa et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib50\">Shohamy et al., 2010</a>).

In the case of associative generalization, such as transitive inference and acquired equivalence, the associative relationship among stimuli determines similarity. This relationship can be established for example by sensory preconditioning (e.g.,\u00a0train stimuli A-B and B-C, test whether A comes to predict C) or by a common associate (e.g. train A-C and B-C, test whether A and B are associated). In contrast, in stimulus generalization the relationship among stimuli is based on the similarity along one or more perceptual dimensions (frequency of sounds, color, line orientation, etc.). Most of what we know about stimulus generalization comes from behavioral experiments utilizing intradimensional stimulus discrimination (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dunsmoor and LaBar, 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib14\">Ghirlanda and Enquist, 2003</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib16\">Guttman and Kalish, 1956</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib17\">Hanson, 1959</a>). In these paradigms, one stimulus (e.g. one particular line orientation) is paired with reward (rewarded conditioned stimulus, CS+), while a second stimulus (e.g. a slightly different line orientation), which differs from the first in only one dimension, is paired with no reward (unrewarded conditioned stimulus, CS\u2212). Generalization is then tested using a range of stimuli that vary along the defining stimulus dimension (e.g. line orientation). Although the test stimuli have never been paired with reward, animals and humans show robust generalization in that they respond to test stimuli that are similar to the CS+. Several psychological models have been developed based on these experiments (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ghirlanda and Enquist, 1998</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib42\">Pearce, 1987</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib43\">1994</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib48\">Shepard, 1987</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib34\">McLaren et al., 2012</a>), but the neurobiological mechanisms regulating the width of stimulus generalization have remained unknown."

While the effects of dopamine have not been investigated in humans, evidence from neuroimaging suggests that dopaminoceptive and dopaminergic regions such as the striatum and the midbrain are involved in generalization (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kahnt et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib58\">Wimmer et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib59\">Wimmer and Shohamy, 2012</a>).

Our central hypothesis was that dopamine is involved in regulating the width of stimulus generalization via the modulation of similarity-based processing in the hippocampus. In order to test this hypothesis, we fit a computational model of stimulus generalization to the behavioral data, and examined the model parameters regulating the width of generalization. We then used model-based fMRI and functional connectivity analyses to identify the brain processes that potentially mediate the effects of dopamine on generalization. We predicted that D2R blockade during the test session would reduce the computational parameters governing the width of generalization, and thus lead to narrower generalization gradients. Moreover, we hypothesized that this reduction would be mirrored in hippocampal activity as well as in reduced functional coupling between the dopaminergic midbrain and the hippocampus."

Specifically, one orientation (39\u00b0) served as the CS+ and was paired with the delivery of 20 cents in 50% of trials, whereas a second orientation (51\u00b0) served as the CS\u2212 and was paired with no reward in all trials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The association between orientation and reward was counterbalanced across subjects. In order to track the acquisition of stimulus-outcome associations, subjects were asked to make a discriminatory response after the stimulus was displayed, but before the outcome was shown. Subjects had to indicate whether the current stimulus was the rewarded stimulus, the non-rewarded stimulus, or whether they were unsure, by pressing buttons associated with +, -, or x, respectively. Subjects learned the discrimination within the first 50 trials and performed at high levels afterwards (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Performance increased as a function of time (two-way, group-by-time ANOVA, main effect of time, F(39,1716) = 18.98, P &lt; 0.001), but did not differ between groups (main effect of group, F(1,44) = 0.41, P = 0.53; group-by-time interaction, F(39,1716) = 1.27, P = 0.13; two-way, group-by-CS type ANOVA, main effect of group, F(1,44) = 0.35, P = 0.56; group-by-CS type interaction, F(1,44) = 0.39, P = 0.53, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Moreover, learning-related activity in the ventral striatum (<a href=\"#bib4\">Delgado, 2007</a>) did not differ between groups (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), suggesting that both groups were also comparable in terms of neural responses during discrimination training. This demonstrates that, as expected, both groups acquired stimulus-outcome associations and performed at comparable levels during training. Accordingly, effects of D2R blockade during the generalization test session on the next day can be compared independent of potential group differences in discrimination training."

These shape features are parsimoniously described by the 4th moment of probability distributions, namely, their kurtosis. Accordingly, a test for differences in the kurtosis of group-specific distributions (Pearson type VII distribution, see Materials and methods) revealed a significantly greater kurtosis in the amisulpride group compared to placebo (PA: 6.73, PP: 3.29; permutation test, P = 0.043).

Critically, associations of stimuli that are similar to the currently presented stimulus have a stronger contribution than the associations of dissimilar stimuli. Because the shape of the function determining the similarity between the currently presented stimulus and other stimuli (i.e. the generalization coefficient) is of critical importance (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ghirlanda and Enquist, 2003</a>), we directly compared the most commonly used models, i.e. one with Gaussian (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kahnt et al., 2012</a>) and the other with exponential similarity functions (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shepard, 1987</a>).

We also compared the fit of the two models by comparing the regression coefficients from a logistic regression of the trial-by-trial responses on the modeled P(+) responses. Although both models predicted behavioral responses reliably (Gaussian: t = 11.06, P &lt; 0.001; exponential: t = 11.38, P &lt; 0.001), we found significantly higher regression coefficients for the Gaussian model (paired t-test t = 5.34, P\u00a0&lt; 0.001).

The width of the inhibitory coefficient was also smaller in the amisulpride group, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.069). Importantly, the learning rate during test did not differ between groups (P = 0.21), demonstrating that additional learning during the test session, which might have been altered by amisulpride, cannot account for the differences in generalization gradients. In order to obtain individual estimates of model parameters, we re-estimated the model using a leave-one-out procedure (see Materials and methods). Comparing the resulting individual estimates between groups confirmed a significant difference in the width of the excitatory (two-sample t-test, t = -2.03, P = 0.024), and to a lesser degree, the inhibitory generalization coefficient (t = -1.59, P = 0.059, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). These results suggest that D2R blockade modulates the computational processes that control the width of stimulus generalization, resulting in narrower generalization."

We first identified brain regions involved in generalization of reward predictions during retrieval. As a proxy of generalized value, we focused on prediction error responses derived from our model, which reflect the extent to which reward predictions have generalized from the original CS+ and CS\u2212 to the current stimulus (please note that because no outcomes were shown, prediction errors are perfectly but negatively correlated with expected value). Accordingly, to identify brain regions involved in similarity-based computations during generalization, we searched for regions in which fMRI activity correlated with generalized prediction errors at the time of the expected outcome. Based on previous empirical and modeling work linking hippocampal activity to the representation of relationships between stimuli and their predicted value (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kumaran et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib24\">Kumaran and McClelland, 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib30\">Lissek et al., 2014a</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib59\">Wimmer and Shohamy, 2012</a>), we expected fMRI signals in the hippocampus to positively correlate with generalized prediction errors. In line with this hypothesis, across the entire group (one sample t-test) we found significant correlations in the bilateral hippocampus (extending into the parahippocampal gyrus, left, x = -30, y = -22, z = -16, t = 6.53, P = 0.001, FWE whole brain corrected; right, x = 33, y = -19, z = -16, t = 7.11, P &lt; 0.001, FWE whole brain corrected, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Similar effects were found in the left amygdala (x = -24, y = -4, z = -19, t = 6.04, P = 0.006, FWE whole brain corrected) and the bilateral middle temporal gyrus (left, x = -48, y = -73, z = 14, t = 6.41, P = 0.002, FWE whole brain corrected; right, x = 28, y = -64, z = 14, t = 5.57, P = 0.022, FWE whole brain corrected).

To examine whether these effects of dopamine on generalization-related activity are specific to the hippocampus, as a control, we tested for similar group differences in the amygdala, middle temporal cortex and mPFC.

However, post-hoc analyses directly comparing the effect of the drug in the hippocampus to the drug effect in the other regions (i.e. group-by-region interactions), demonstrated that while the effect of D2R blockade in the hippocampus was significantly stronger than in the mPFC (P = 0.02) similar interactions involving the amygdala (P = 0.097) and the middle temporal gyrus (P = 0.127) did not reach significance.

Given the anatomical origin of the dopaminergic projections to the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib55\">Swanson, 1982</a>), the relevance of hippocampal D2R for memory functions (<a href=\"#bib56\">Takahashi et al., 2008</a>), and the modulation of hippocampal processing reported above, we hypothesized that amisulpride would reduce the functional connectivity between the midbrain and the hippocampus. In line with this prediction, a functional connectivity analysis with the midbrain as a seed region (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, see Materials and methods) revealed decreased midbrain connectivity in the right hippocampus (x = 33, y = -19, z = -19, t = 3.68, P = 0.02, FWE small volume corrected, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>) and the left striatum (x = -9, y = 8, z = -19, t = 4.26, P = 0.001, FWE small volume corrected), in the amisulpride compared to the placebo group. This finding suggests that D2R blockade may modulate the functional connectivity between the midbrain and dopaminergic target regions such as the hippocampus and the striatum. To examine the specificity of these findings, we tested for similar drug-related effects on functional connectivity in the regions involved in similarity-based processing defined above. While connectivity estimates differed significantly between groups in middle temporal gyrus (P = 0.01), no drug effects were observed in the amygdala (P = 0.296) and the mPFC (P = 0.17). Accordingly, for all regions except the middle temporal gyrus (P = 0.13), the corresponding drug-by-region interactions were significant (all Ps &lt; 0.05), suggesting that amisulpride-related decreases in midbrain connectivity are relatively specific to the hippocampus."

Specifically, we tested the correlation between midbrain-hippocampal connectivity and the estimated width of generalization coefficients in the amisulpride group. This correlation was significant for the inhibitory generalization coefficient (r = 0.47, P\u00a0= 0.01, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>), but not for the excitatory coefficient (r = 0.18, P = 0.19). We replicated these findings in our previous data set (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kahnt et al., 2012</a>), showing that midbrain-hippocampal connectivity was significantly correlated with the inhibitory generalization coefficient (r = 0.44, P = 0.036), but not with the excitatory coefficient (r = 0.15, P = 0.49). Interestingly, this relationship was not observed for midbrain-striatal connections (P &gt; 0.16), and was significantly stronger for midbrain-hippocampal compared to midbrain-striatal connectivity (Z = 2.31, P = 0.011), suggesting that the relation between dopamine and the width of generalization may arise primarily from midbrain-hippocampal connections. In summary, these findings suggest a link between dopamine-mediated midbrain-hippocampal coupling and the width of stimulus generalization in humans."

However, this function was thought to only apply to associative forms of generalization involving higher-order relationships, whereas basic stimulus generalization involving perceptual similarity is suggested to be hippocampus-independent (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kumaran, 2012</a>). Opposing this view, here we provide evidence that the hippocampus is involved in stimulus generalization. Accordingly, our findings suggest that hippocampal similarity computations are not restricted to detecting higher-order relationships among stimuli as previously thought, but can also exploit the perceptual similarity between stimuli to establish meaningful relationships. While the hippocampus may not be necessary for stimulus generalization per se, our data suggest that it facilitates generalization by allowing a flexible modulation of its width. Specifically, such flexibility could not be achieved if discrimination and generalization were entirely based on static, hippocampus-independent, stimulus-outcome associations."

Two alternative accounts suggest that the relationship among stimuli is established by the hippocampus either during encoding via overlapping neural codes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Eichenbaum, 1999</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib18\">Howard et al., 2005</a>), or at the time of retrieval by means of recurrent similarity computations that are based on separated neural codes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kumaran and McClelland, 2012</a>). The former proposal has received empirical support from studies showing that hippocampal activity during encoding is related to transfer performance at test (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shohamy and Wagner, 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib59\">Wimmer and Shohamy, 2012</a>). In contrast, in line with the second account, our model assumes that reward predictions are generalized and integrated during test (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pearce, 1987</a>). It should be noted though that this model is mathematically equivalent to a model in which generalization occurs at encoding (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kahnt et al., 2012</a>), and thus, the model alone does not provide evidence for either account. However, only if generalization occurs at retrieval can the width of generalization be modulated after encoding has occurred, and thus, our results are only compatible with a retrieval-based account of generalization. Specifically, because dopamine receptor blockade modulated generalization gradients during test, without affecting additional learning, our pharmacological manipulation provides evidence that stimulus generalization occurs \u2013 at least in part \u2013 at retrieval."

By extension, enhanced dopaminergic activity in the hippocampus may increase the width of generalization. More specifically, dopamine release in the hippocampus could increase the likelihood that ensemble patterns representing similar stimuli are activated, which would effectively lower the threshold for similarity detection, and, by broadening the range of stimuli for which reward predictions are taken into account, facilitate generalization. Conversely, reduced levels of dopamine would decrease the likelihood of ensemble pattern activation, increase the threshold for similarity detection, and, by enhancing fine-tuned discrimination, reduce generalization. This provides a simple neurobiological mechanism by which dopamine may flexibly adjust generalization during retrieval. Such flexibility is highly adaptive as it allows for different levels of generalization based on the state of the organism or the environment. We speculate that tonic dopamine levels, similar to their enabling effects on movements (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schultz, 2007</a>), play an enabling role in generalization. For instance, in situations where dopamine transmission is high, such as in novel environments (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ihalainen et al., 1999</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib28\">Lisman and Grace, 2005</a>), elevated levels of dopamine may not only support memory formation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Shohamy and Adcock, 2010</a>), but also broaden generalization and thereby facilitate exploratory behavior."

This raises the possibility that only the effects of D2R blockade on the inhibitory coefficient are mediated via a modulation of midbrain-hippocampal connectivity, whereas the effects on the excitatory coefficient are mediated via a different, yet to be explored, mechanism. The dissociation between inhibitory and excitatory generalization coefficients is in line with the interpretation of previous results suggesting that administration of chlorpromazine, a nonspecific dopamine receptor antagonist, specifically reduces the strength of inhibitory associations in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lyons et al., 1973b</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib57\">Terrace, 1963</a>).

Specifically, the current experiment suggests an association between dopamine and the width of generalization in the hippocampus, and dissociates effects of generalization during retrieval vs. encoding, which could not be achieved with the previous design. However, whereas here we find that prediction errors correlate primarily with activity in the hippocampus, the previous study identified prediction error related activity primarily in the ventral striatum. Also, in the previous study functional connectivity between the striatum and the hippocampus was related to the modeled generalization coefficients, whereas our current results suggest a facilitating role of midbrain-hippocampal connections. Several notable\u00a0differences in the design of both experiments might explain these discrepancies. Most importantly, the previous design consisted of multiple alternating training and testing blocks, all conducted within one session on a single day, whereas in the current study, training and test did not alternate but were conducted in distinct sessions that were separated by a 24 hr delay. Moreover, in the 2012 study, CS-outcome associations were deterministic (100% contingency), whereas the current experiment involved a 50% reinforcement schedule in order to slow down extinction during test. These differences could have shifted the primary focus of generalization-related processing from the striatum to the hippocampus."

Accordingly, our results have important clinical implications for a number of neuropsychiatric disorders in which generalization is disrupted.

To test for group differences, parameter estimates were extracted from significant voxels in the striatum (training) and hippocampus (test), and compared between groups using two-sample t-tests at a statistical threshold of P &lt; 0.05. Significant group differences in functional connectivity were identified using a threshold of P &lt; 0.05, FWE small volume corrected for a functional region of interest in the hippocampus that was identified in the independent prediction error contrast during test in the entire group of subjects (P &lt; 0.05, FWE-corrected). A priori comparisons using t-tests and correlations with directed hypotheses are tested one-tailed."

Importantly, all group comparisons remained significant when RT was included as a covariate in the statistical models, suggesting that non-significant differences in RT did not confound the imaging results."

How do you know the effects of the drug are not due to global differences in dopamine transmission, that are having an impact on BOLD activity in multiple places in parallel with (but not necessarily related to) the subtle differences in behavior? The study already addresses this somewhat by showing selectivity of effects on functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the midbrain, but not with the striatum. And the findings ruling out mere differences in perception also help address this point. But similar control analyses are also needed for the generalization gradient, to determine whether there is really a selective effect of the drug in the hippocampus, as the authors currently conclude. For example, Paz and colleagues have suggested an important role for the amygdala and the PFC in perceptual generalization. These regions are also targets of midbrain region and it would be useful to know whether or not they show parallel effects."

Two groups of subjects first learnt which of two oriented gabor patches (CS+ 39 deg, CS- 51) were associated with positive or neutral outcome. Following drug (PA) or placebo (PP) administration they then performed the generalization test where they responded to 15 different orientations not presented during training (between 17-73 deg; no outcome presented) with multiple repetitions of each item. Main findings of interest: i) as in their (2012) and other studies a classic peak shift generalization curve was observed (i.e. away from CS-) ii) whilst there was no significant difference between the groups in the raw data, groups different when a similarity based model of generalization was used (i.e. excitatory generalization coefficient was larger in PP group; n.s. trend for inhib coefficient). Iii) Modelled prediction errors during generalization were observed in the hippocampus, and greater in the PP group. Further there was a reduction in midbrain-hippocampus functional connectivity in the PA group, that was associated with individual differences in modeled inhibitory coefficient. Overall findings are discussed as implicating dopaminergic circuit and hippocampus in flexible stimulus generalization based on neuromodulatory state."

In brief, and detailed subsequently: dopamine is known to affect the strength of hippocampal encoding and perhaps this is the reason for changes in the generalization curve. This would be important (apart from changing the mechanistic explanation) because it suggests that the dopamine/hippocampal effect is to some extent paradigm specific: it does not apply to \"one-shot\" generalization (perhaps more naturalistic), but only under settings where lots of stimuli are presented and generalization required."

It certainly seems conceivable that in this setting the hippocampus is important in setting up these representations, and the behavioral generalization curve then reflects the concurrent retrieval of these representations in parallel (i.e. as in exemplar models) to compute an EV for the current stimulus (as the authors suggest). My question is how a difference in the strength of these item representations in the hippocampus could influence the generalization curve? At present this is not modeled, and given the known role of dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal encoding this seems an additional factor to consider. Assuming the authors agree with this, could they incorporate this as an additional parameter in the model (distinct from the learning rate, which applies to value updating), and report the results?"

Reviewers were also concerned that other (unmodelled) factors (e.g. new learning during testing session affected by dopamine) could be at play which make it less clear that dopamine is specifically changing the hippocampal generalization gradient, and that the current findings weren't well integrated with your previous findings. \u2013 The specificity of the effects was not fully established. Reviewers suggest control analyses that would address whether indeed what was seen in the hippocampus is something that is unique to the hippocampus, or whether it was a general effect of pharmacology in BOLD signal that was not observed elsewhere.</i>"

Specifically, we now demonstrate an effect of amisulpride on the shape of behavioral generalization gradients by showing that compared to placebo, gradients in the amisulpride group have a significantly greater kurtosis. We also show that our model fits the behavioral data well, and compare our model to alternative potential models. Specifically, we demonstrate that the effect of amisulpride on model parameters controlling the width of generalization does not depend on the choice of the specific model. Moreover, we show that our original model with a Gaussian similarity function outperforms a model with an exponential similarity function and that adding a sensory learning mechanism does not improve the fit of the model. We then use the winning model to guide the analysis of the behavioral and neural data and characterize significant effects of the dopamine manipulation on model parameters. We also show that additional learning during test does not explain our results."

On the second day they were tested for generalization of the training to new samples varying in similarity to the trained items. The generalization test took place either under drug (D2 receptor blocker) or under placebo, in a between-subject design. The results suggest that both groups generalize similarly, overall. But the application of a computational model of generalization revealed subtle but interesting differences in the width of the generalization gradient, with a narrower gradient in the drug-treated group. This difference in the generalization gradient was associated with differences in BOLD activity in the hippocampus, with the drug group showing a weaker generalization-related BOLD response. Overall this is a solid and informative study using a convergence of methods to address an interesting question. I have just a few comments: 1) As with any pharmacological study, one must raise concerns about selectivity. How do you know the effects of the drug are not due to global differences in dopamine transmission, that are having an impact on BOLD activity in multiple places in parallel with (but not necessarily related to) the subtle differences in behavior? The study already addresses this somewhat by showing selectivity of effects on functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the midbrain, but not with the striatum. And the findings ruling out mere differences in perception also help address this point. But similar control analyses are also needed for the generalization gradient, to determine whether there is really a selective effect of the drug in the hippocampus, as the authors currently conclude. For example, Paz and colleagues have suggested an important role for the amygdala and the PFC in perceptual generalization. These regions are also targets of midbrain region and it would be useful to know whether or not they show parallel effects.</i>"

Because the early visual cortex contains only very few dopamine receptors (Lidow et al. 1989, PNAS), visual activity provides a good control for non-specific (i.e., non-dopaminergic) effects of the drug on blood flow and the BOLD response. We therefore tested for drug-related differences in visual cue-related activity in the early visual cortex (AAL, calcarine sulcus). We did not find any differences in cue-related activity in early visual cortex between groups (t = -0.80, P = 0.42), suggesting that amisulpride did not affect global blood flow.

Specifically, the difference between the exponential and Gaussian similarity functions is determined by the exponent of the (absolute) difference between xj and xk (1 and 2 for the exponential and Gaussian model, respectively). Instead of comparing the fit of different theoretical shapes (exponential and Gaussian), we have also directly estimated the best fitting exponent by including the exponent as an additional free parameter in the model. This resulted in a parameter of 2.04, close to the assumed Gaussian model. Also for this model, the width of the inhibitory and excitatory generalization coefficients differed significantly between groups (P = 0.013 and P = 0.016, for the inhibitory and excitatory coefficients, respectively). However, because this exponential model came at the expense of an additional parameter, without substantially increasing the LLE, it was outperformed by the Gaussian model as indicated by lower AIC and BIC values for the Gaussian model (AIC = 9586.4 vs. 9588.3 and BIC = 9629.2 vs. 9638.2 for Gaussian vs. exponent as free parameter, respectively). These results demonstrate that the effect of amisulpride on the parameters controlling the width of generalization does not depend on the choice of the specific model.

However, if the reviewer feels this should be included, we would be happy to revise the manuscript accordingly."

Whilst this makes sense at face value, I wonder whether that there are potentially complicated interactions at play during the generalization test that may (also/instead) be affected by dopamine. In brief, and detailed subsequently: dopamine is known to affect the strength of hippocampal encoding and perhaps this is the reason for changes in the generalization curve. This would be important (apart from changing the mechanistic explanation) because it suggests that the dopamine/hippocampal effect is to some extent paradigm specific: it does not apply to \"one-shot\" generalization (perhaps more naturalistic), but only under settings where lots of stimuli are presented and generalization required. To state this in more detail: subjects are learning during the generalization phase: i.e. storing new representations of the previously unseen test items and their predicted values (which are being constantly updated). It certainly seems conceivable that in this setting the hippocampus is important in setting up these representations, and the behavioral generalization curve then reflects the concurrent retrieval of these representations in parallel (i.e. as in exemplar models) to compute an EV for the current stimulus (as the authors suggest). My question is how a difference in the strength of these item representations in the hippocampus could influence the generalization curve? At present this is not modeled, and given the known role of dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal encoding this seems an additional factor to consider. Assuming the authors agree with this, could they incorporate this as an additional parameter in the model (distinct from the learning rate, which applies to value updating), and report the results?</i>"

The result is an interesting paper presenting solid findings that are likely to be of broad interest. I have a couple of remaining comments: 1) The rational for the prediction error analysis in the test phase is not spelled out clearly enough. Perhaps I misunderstood, but I thought the authors were arguing that the effect of dopamine at test is essentially on the retrieval of a learned representation, the generalization itself, and that it is explicitly not related to trial by trial updating during the test phase. This leaves me questioning what the link is to the prediction error at the outcome phase rather than the response/choice at the stimulus presentation phase.</i>"
