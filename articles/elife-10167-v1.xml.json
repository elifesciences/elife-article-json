This removes the need to rely on stochastic simulations or approximate formulae (derived using the fluctuation dissipation theorem). These calculations allow for further analysis of the predictions of the model. On the basis of this we question the extent to which the model can be used to conclude that peroxisome biogenesis is dominated by de novo production when <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells are grown on glucose medium."

Accessible discussions can be found in several books (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bailey, 1990</a>, which is a reissue of the classic text from 1964; <a href=\"#bib15\">Taylor and Karlin, 1998</a>). In such analyses, the three processes of de novo production, production by fission, and loss by first order decay are often termed immigration, birth and death, respectively. Immigration is used for a process that increases the number of individuals but does not require any other individuals already to be present. Birth is the process by which one individual gives rise to a second individual. Death is a process by which a particular individual is lost from a population with a probability that is independent of any other members of the population.

If the distribution <i>f<sub>n</sub></i> is evaluated at different times after the starting point of simulations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) then different distributions are obtained; hence the distribution is \u201ctime dependent\u201d. As the probability (or population) distribution varies in time (and since the system can in principle be started from any state) then it is not strictly possible to talk of \u201cthe distribution\u201d for a stochastic system. However in many birth and death models the system will settle down to a limiting distribution, independent of the starting states of the cell(s) as in the cyan and red curves in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>. Such a situation corresponds to a state of dynamic equilibrium that is familiar from chemical kinetics. Thus the terms limiting, equilibrium (or steady state) distributions can be used in this context interchangeably.

One method is to note <i>n</i> at a set of time points for a single cell (such as points drawn from the trajectories in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and the other is to take a large number of cells at one point in time, and measure <i>n</i> across this ensemble of cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). The former would require a time dependent set of observations that may be difficult to obtain experimentally. The latter approach is equivalent to making experimental observations on a large field of view of cells, or of making repeated simulations. However there is a large caveat that when the measurements are made one must be convinced that the cells have had \u201clong enough to reach equilibrium\u201d since the last significant perturbation to the system. If this is not the case then the distribution measured will be contaminated with contributions from non-equilibrium distributions (such as from the magenta, yellow, green and blue curves in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

It is clear from <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> that the inferred contribution from fission grows only rather slowly as the Fano factor increases above a value of two. In other words, for fission to be truly dominant a Fano factor would have to be observed that was far greater than any reported in the SMOP paper."

Considering a single cell, the number of organelles will be limited by the fact that as <i>n</i> grows larger then the decay process (whose rate increases proportionally to <i>n</i>) will become increasingly more likely than the de novo formation process (which is independent of <i>n</i>). If the fission process is introduced then there is now a <i>production</i> term that also increases proportionally to <i>n</i>. If <i>k<sub>fission</sub></i> exceeds <i>\u03b3</i> then the fission process will always exceed the decay process and the number of organelles will grow without limit."

Thus at first sight there appear to be two different ways in which the Fano factor can become very large. One way, as extensively discussed in the SMOP analysis and above, is if the mean rate <i>k<sub>fission</sub></i>&lt;<i>n</i>&gt; becomes large compared to the mean rate <i>k<sub>de novo</sub></i>. The other way, that becomes clear from our analysis, is if the rate constant <i>k<sub>fission</sub></i> becomes similar to the rate constant <i>\u03b3</i>. The connection between these two relations is that &lt;<i>n</i>&gt; is a function of all three rate constants. This emphasises the hidden complexity of the interplay of the parameters in this model."

That the distribution of numbers of organelles can give a clue to the mechanisms by which organelles are formed is a very elegant idea, and the SMOP analysis combines this idea with a very simple kinetic model. As we explored the system further we realised that the fluctuation dissipation theorem result was not necessary for analysis of the system, and that enforcing the equilibrium condition, that was implicit in the work already, greatly simplified the analysis."

A main piece of evidence for the correctness of the model was the agreement of the experimentally observed Fano factors for the vacuole data with those from the model. We have shown this agreement to be much less perfect than originally demonstrated. We have also shown that there is a strong interplay between different parameters in the model. This means that the agreement of experimental data with the model is not as compelling as originally presented and that the interpretation of experimental observations back to mechanistic conclusions is open to question. We hope that our analysis will stimulate discussion as to whether, for instance, the SMOP model captures the key features of the underlying processes and is just lacking some details; or whether the model fundamentally lacks key aspects of feedback. The assumption that observations of cells grown in batch culture faithfully report equilibrium distributions also requires further verification."

                        "text": "Nevertheless the model does suggest that the proportion of production by fission increases by about a factor of five on switching to oleate growth. Supporting evidence for this was provided by the observation of the reduction in the inferred fission contribution in cells grown on oleate in which the fission factors Vps1 or Dnm1 (or Fis1, an accessory factor of Dnm1) were deleted. On the other hand, no data were shown for glucose grown cells harbouring the same deletions. On glucose the Fano factor is reported in the SMOP analysis as 1.1, with &lt;<i>n</i>&gt;\u00a0=\u00a03, and from <a href=\"#equ3\">Equations 3,4</a> one obtains <i>k</i><sub><i>de\u00a0novo</i>\u00a0</sub>=\u00a02.7<i>\u03b3</i> and <i>k</i><sub><i>fission</i>\u00a0</sub>=\u00a00.1<i>\u03b3</i>. The model then implies that on deletion of the fission pathway (i.e. setting <i>k<sub>fission\u00a0</sub></i>=\u00a00) then &lt;<i>n</i>&gt; would only drop by 10%. Peroxisome count data has been reported recently (Fig S4, <a href=\"#bib9\">Motley <i>et al.</i>, 2015</a>), with values of &lt;<i>n</i>&gt;\u00a0=\u00a04.9 in WT cells, &lt;<i>n</i>&gt;\u00a0=\u00a01.5 in <i>vps1\u0394</i> cells and &lt;<i>n</i>&gt;\u00a0=\u00a01.2 in <i>vps1\u0394dnm1\u0394</i> cells. The drops in peroxisome numbers in <i>vps1\u0394</i> and <i>vps1\u0394dnm1\u0394</i> cells are much greater than the 10% estimated above from the SMOP model. There is also peroxisome count data in <a href=\"#bib8\">Kuravi et al. (2006)</a>, which gives &lt;<i>n</i>&gt;\u00a0=\u00a01.6 (<i>WT</i>), &lt;<i>n</i>&gt;\u00a0=\u00a01.2 (<i>vps1\u0394</i>), &lt;<i>n</i>&gt;\u00a0=\u00a01.7 (<i>dnm1\u0394</i>), &lt;<i>n</i>&gt;\u00a0=\u00a00.9 (<i>dnm1\u0394vps1\u0394</i>). The drop in &lt;<i>n</i>&gt; for the <i>dnm1\u0394vps1\u0394</i> again conflicts with the idea that fission is such a small contributor to the biogenesis process. The discrepancies between these various data possibly arise from difficulties in quantifying peroxisome numbers, especially when cells contain a large number of small (and therefore low fluorescence) peroxisomes as may be the case when fission is a strong contributor to biogenesis. The problem of peroxisome counts depending on the brightness of fluorescent markers has been commented on by <a href=\"#bib5\">Jung <i>et al.</i> (2010)</a>."

Such a push raises significant challenges not only in terms of developing tractable models and justifying the underlying assumptions, but also in terms of the application of the model to complex experimental data. In particular this work highlights the need for greater accounting for detection limits and intensity distributions, as well of time dependent issues, in the reporting and analysis of organelle count data, if these are to be used to infer details of organelle biogenesis mechanisms."

It is not a standard Poisson distribution since, as noted in the SMOP paper, such a model cannot reach a state with <i>n\u00a0=</i>\u00a00 from a state with <i>n\u00a0</i>&gt;\u00a00 since the fusion probability is zero when <i>n\u00a0=\u00a0</i>1.

The reviewers agree that there was a major error in the O'Shea paper, namely the use of the shifted rather than the truncated Poisson distribution. Other than this, the mathematical results reported in the previous paper are correct as far as they go. Your manuscript shows that certain expressions in the Mukherji and O'Shea paper are exact, even though O'Shea and colleagues had reported them as approximate. This cannot be considered an error. The use of the word \"dominant\" is misleading, but is not a mathematical error. An abbreviated summary of the reviews follows."

The authors' response was to provide more detailed simulations in which they showed that the Fano factors did not vary greatly when partitioning of organelles during division was taken into account, and was approximately as observed when the only mode of organelle reduction was a first-order decay term. This argument was convincing, assuming that equilibrium had truly been reached. I will add that the idea mentioned in the present manuscript (subsection \u201cDoes the SMOP analysis imply equilibrium distributions?\u201d) that only if the time to equilibrium is short compared to the cell cycle time will the limiting distribution be valid, is a matter of scope. If the model explicitly includes cell division as one of the processes, that larger model will itself reach a limiting distribution. I agree that Mukherji and O'Shea provided no evidence that equilibrium had been reached, either in the simulations or the experiments, and were not requested to by the reviewers. This condition is typically assumed to be correct, and rarely are authors asked for evidence."

I would assume that Mukherji and O'Shea would have done the correct validation steps, and there is some evidence of that in their <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> for example. However, it is then difficult to understand how the error about the truncated vs. the shifted Poisson distribution could have arisen. I admit that this point could have been discovered by the reviewers if they had explicitly repeated some of the reported calculations in the Mukherji and O'Shea paper, and I for one overlooked it. It is unclear how the exact stochastic simulations could be in agreement with an incorrect shifted Poisson prediction. In the Mukherji and O'Shea paper no simulation matching the shifted Poisson prediction is given. Perhaps this simulation was never done, otherwise Mukherji and O'Shea would have discovered the discrepancy."

This is a valid but minor concern; Mukherji and O'Shea would likely be able to provide the derivation. The point that the approximations were not necessary given the existence of an exact result is worth reporting but does not on its own detract from the original findings.

The present manuscript in a sense validates this hope: discussion has indeed been stimulated. However, it is true that the original paper contained one major error not caught in the review process: use of the shifted rather than the truncated Poisson distribution. The present author argues that this weakens the central attraction of the previous paper, which was the strong agreement of theory and experiment. I would argue that the agreement itself, which was admittedly a striking feature, was not the central point on which the Mukherji and O'Shea paper stood. If the original paper had reported the correct distribution and highlighted the discrepancy with measured data, that would have also been food for thought."

The authors' response was to provide more detailed simulations in which they showed that the Fano factors did not vary greatly when partitioning of organelles during division was taken into account, and was approximately as observed when the only mode of organelle reduction was a first-order decay term. This argument was convincing, assuming that equilibrium had truly been reached. I will add that the idea mentioned in the present manuscript (subsection \u201cDoes the SMOP analysis imply equilibrium distributions?\u201d) that only if the time to equilibrium is short compared to the cell cycle time will the limiting distribution be valid, is a matter of scope.If the model explicitly includes cell division as one of the processes, that larger model will itself reach a limiting distribution.

The present manuscript in a sense validates this hope: discussion has indeed been stimulated. However, it is true that the original paper contained one major error not caught in the review process: use of the shifted rather than the truncated Poisson distribution. The present author argues that this weakens the central attraction of the previous paper, which was the strong agreement of theory and experiment. I would argue that the agreement itself, which was admittedly a striking feature, was not the central point on which the Mukherji and O'Shea paper stood. If the original paper had reported the correct distribution and highlighted the discrepancy with measured data, that would have also been food for thought.</i>"

That, in itself, is part of a fairly standard <i>inductive</i> scientific method with its attendant strengths and weaknesses. There was very little justification otherwise of the underlying model, and certain aspects of the model deserve more discussion."

But whether it is appropriate for objects such as vacuoles seems harder to justify. It implies that the likelihood (within the next small delta-t) of a vacuole fusing with another when <i>n = 3</i> is <i>double</i> that when <i>n = 2</i>. One could envisage that when <i>n = 2</i> there could be a very similar degree of <i>total</i> contact area with other vacuoles as when <i>n = 3</i>, and so the fusion probability would be very similar. It would depend on vacuole size, composition and \u201cpacking\u201d. I am not aware that sufficiently detailed analysis of such factors exists: it is certainly not quoted in the SMOP paper."

However, in the absence of such agreement, then, such discussion is vital: is the model basically a good one but just lacking a little detail or is the model fundamentally lacking key aspects of feedback? I hope this will stimulate more discussion on these issues."
