Despite compromised direct DNA-binding, NKX2-5 mutants retained partial functionality and bound hundreds of targets, including NKX2-5 wild type targets and unique sets of 'off-targets'. NKX2-5\u2206HD, which lacks the entire homeodomain, could still dimerise with wild type NKX2-5 and its cofactors, including newly-discovered cofactors of the ETS family, through the conserved tyrosine-rich domain (YRD). NKX2-5\u2206HD off-targets showed overrepresentation of many binding motifs, including ETS motifs, the majority co-occupied by ETS proteins as determined by DamID. Off-targets of an NKX2-5 YRD mutant were not enriched in ETS targets. Our study reveals off-target binding and transcriptional activity for NKX2-5 mutations driven in part by cofactor interactions, suggesting a novel type of gain-of-function in congenital heart disease."
