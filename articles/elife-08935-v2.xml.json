                    "text": "Although damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) causes hemianopia, many patients retain some residual vision; known as blindsight. We show that blindsight may be facilitated by an intact white-matter pathway between the lateral geniculate nucleus and motion area hMT+. Visual psychophysics, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and fibre tractography were applied in 17 patients with V1 damage acquired during adulthood and 9 age-matched controls. Individuals with V1 damage were subdivided into blindsight positive (preserved residual vision) and negative (no residual vision) according to psychophysical performance. All blindsight positive individuals showed intact geniculo-hMT+ pathways, while this pathway was significantly impaired or not measurable in blindsight negative individuals. Two white matter pathways previously implicated in blindsight: (i) superior colliculus to hMT+ and (ii) between hMT+ in each hemisphere were not consistently present in blindsight positive cases. Understanding the visual pathways crucial for residual vision may direct future rehabilitation strategies for hemianopia patients."

We show that blindsight may be facilitated by an intact white-matter pathway between the lateral geniculate nucleus and motion area hMT+. Visual psychophysics, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and fibre tractography were applied in 17 patients with V1 damage acquired during adulthood and 9 age-matched controls. Individuals with V1 damage were subdivided into blindsight positive (preserved residual vision) and negative (no residual vision) according to psychophysical performance. All blindsight positive individuals showed intact geniculo-hMT+ pathways, while this pathway was significantly impaired or not measurable in blindsight negative individuals. Two white matter pathways previously implicated in blindsight: (i) superior colliculus to hMT+ and (ii) between hMT+ in each hemisphere were not consistently present in blindsight positive cases. Understanding the visual pathways crucial for residual vision may direct future rehabilitation strategies for hemianopia patients."

Over the past 30 years, several visual pathways have been proposed to underlie this residual vision, but the relative role of these pathways and the neurobiological bases for blindsight remains unknown (see <a href=\"#bib17\">Cowey, 2010</a> for review)."

In agreement with this proposal, the macaque LGN can support residual visual processing after V1 lesion (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schmid et al., 2010</a>). Two alternative proposals suggest blindsight results either from visual plasticity, for example to strengthen interhemispheric white matter in humans (<a href=\"#bib32\">Leh et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bridge et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tamietto et al., 2012</a>) or intact connections to hMT+ from the superior colliculus and pulvinar, demonstrated in the macaque (<a href=\"#bib51\">Warner et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">2015</a>).

We counted the number of fascicles between each of several ROI pairs in each brain. The precise number of fascicles is an arbitrary value, dependent on many interacting tracking parameters and properties of the measured diffusion data (see <a href=\"#bib38\">Pestilli et al., 2014</a> and \u2018Discussion\u2019 for more details). Here, we used fascicle count as an indirect measure of the difficulty of tracking a white matter pathway. To further standardise the measure, we used an anatomical standardisation method to eliminate outlier fascicles from counts while constraining the number to a conservative lower bound within each individual brain. This was achieved by removing outlier fascicles defined as those more than about 2.5 standard deviations away from or longer than each core tract (2.6 and 2.8 SD respectively; see <a href=\"#bib3\">Allen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pestilli et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yeatman et al., 2012</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details).

In blindsight negative patients it was possible to track a pathway between the LGN and hMT+ in the damaged hemisphere of 4/5 patients (we failed to identify the tract in PN4), with a similar number of fascicles to blindsight positive patients (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

                                "text": "Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are commonly used diffusion MRI indices, representing tissue microstructure in situations of neuronal damage (<a href=\"#bib54\">Werring et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jones et al., 2013</a>). These measures are quite sensitive to a number of tissue properties, such as axonal ordering, axonal packing density, degree of myelination, membrane permeability, without being very specific to any one of them. This can result in difficulties related to interpretation. FA is derived from the relationship between the amounts of free water anisotropic diffusion in a single (principal) direction, relative to all other directions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Basser, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jones et al., 2013</a>). Decreases in FA have been associated with impaired tissue microstructure. MD is a measure of the total mean diffusion magnitude in all directions in a voxel, and its value also reflects a complex relationship with tissue microstructure. In general, white matter tissue damage has been associated with an increase in MD (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jones et al., 2013</a>). We used an advanced tract-anatomy informed analysis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yeatman et al., 2012</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for more details) and measured FA and MD along the length of each individual tract. We then computed the mean FA and MD measures along each tract using the core portion of the pathway to eliminate artifactual measurements due to potential partial voluming with grey matter and scar tissue. Mean FA and MD for each core tract were averaged for each participant to generate separate measures for the ipsilesional and intact hemispheres. Mean FA, calculated across all blindsight positive patients and collapsed along the whole geniculate-hMT+ pathway, was 0.43 \u00b1 0.05 (mean \u00b1 s.d.) in the damaged hemisphere and 0.49 \u00b1 0.05 in the intact hemisphere, corresponding to a laterality of 13.7% (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). Laterality, representing the relative difference in diffusivity for equivalent tracts in opposite hemispheres, was slightly more prominent over the early-mid portions of the pathway. In blindsight negative patients (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, middle column), the microstructure of ipsilesional tracts was particularly abnormal. Mean FA was 0.35 \u00b1 0.1 (mean \u00b1 s.d.) on the ipsilesional side, vs 0.47 \u00b1 0.03 in the intact hemisphere (laterality = 34.7%). In comparison, control participants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, right column) show a left-right laterality of 3.3% for FA (range = 0.3\u20130.66. Mean FA = 0.51 \u00b1 0.03 left, 0.49 \u00b1 0.03 right hemisphere) and 1.6% for MD (range = 0.56 x 10<sup>\u22123</sup>\u20130.91 x 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, Mean MD = 0.73 x 10<sup>\u22123</sup> \u00b1 0.03 x 10<sup>\u22123</sup> left, 0.72 x 10<sup>\u22123</sup> \u00b1 0.03 x 10<sup>\u22123</sup> right hemisphere)."

In the central nervous system, anterograde (Wallerian) or retrograde neuronal degeneration can occur following axonal injury. Consequently, the integrity of optic radiation fibres innervating damaged V1 would be abnormal throughout their course (similar to <a href=\"#bib19\">Danek et al., 1990</a>). Where overlap with such fibres occurs, the dMRI measurements would not distinguish between separate axonal bundles due to limitations in spatial resolution (restricted here to 2 mm isotropic voxel size). Thus measures of the geniculate-hMT+ tract could become contaminated with overlapping degenerated optic radiation fibres. It may therefore be useful to measure the diffusivity spanning only the distal portion of the geniculate-hMT+ tract, which has branched away from the large geniculate-V1 radiation bundle. This may represent a purer measure of the pathway, removing artefacts due to overlapping tracts. If the pathway to hMT+ were actually damaged, one would still expect this measure to reflect the damage."

This is consistent with our recent fMRI report of motion processing after V1 damage (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ajina et al., 2015a</a>). A similar direct geniculate pathway was identified in all age-matched controls, and is consistent with neuroanatomical investigation in the macaque (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sincich et al., 2004</a>). This was not the case in blindsight negative patients, where such geniculo-extrastriate tracts were either absent or demonstrated significant impairment in mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy. This has two important implications that support geniculate-extrastriate connections in blindsight. (1) It is possible that intact connections between the LGN and hMT+ are <i>sufficient</i> for blindsight, since no patients with blindsight function demonstrated an absence or impairment in these pathways. (2) Intact connections between the LGN and hMT+ may also be <i>necessary</i> for blindsight function. This is supported by the results in blindsight negative patients, as none of the patients without blindsight function possessed normal, intact connections in this pathway. However, since the current study only investigated a limited number of potential pathways, it is possible that other, unexplored, pathways could also underlie blindsight function in these patients."

Firstly, the most commonly described pathway is a di-synaptic pathway from colliculus to hMT+ via the inferior pulvinar (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lyon et al., 2010</a>). Thus, this corresponds to the collicular-hMT+ pathway examined here that was both difficult to track, but also showed reduced microstructure in a number of blindsight positive patients. A direct, retinorecipient pathway from the inferior pulvinar has been described in the marmoset (<a href=\"#bib51\">Warner et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that it would also be worth considering only a connection between inferior pulvinar and hMT+. A recent human tractography study considered tracts from both LGN and pulvinar to hMT+ as part of an investigation into the visual pathways in amblyopia (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allen et al., 2015</a>). Quantification of the tract microstructure found that they were very similar with almost identical values for both FA and MD. Thus, at the current resolution of 2 mm isotropic voxels, dissecting apart these two tracts may be impossible, due to the proximity of the thalamic structures. In future studies, higher spatial resolution may help to disentangle these two important pathways. Thus, we cannot completely rule out the presence of an intact direct pathway from the retina to hMT+ via the pulvinar."

GY sustained his brain injury aged 8 years, and the hemispherectomy patients sustained severe structural brain damage at birth or in early childhood, despite undergoing resective surgery later in life. Both studies identified increased interhemispheric connectivity in blindsight, unlike the cases of cortical blindness and patients in the current study, all of whom sustained damage in adulthood. This could be consistent with an increased propensity for plasticity in the corpus callosum, which continues to grow in cross-sectional area until early adulthood (<a href=\"#bib31\">Keshavan et al., 2002</a>)."

It has been argued in the past that different forms of blindsight may be mediated by distinct anatomical pathways or structures (<a href=\"#bib18\">Danckert and Rossetti, 2005</a>). For example, collicular processing may be involved in \u2018action\u2019 or \u2018attention\u2019 blindsight, whilst the LGN is implicated in perceptual characteristics, described as \u2018agnosopsia\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zeki and Ffytche, 1998</a>). The definition of blindsight differs considerably between tractography studies, ranging from comparable 2-AFC testing (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bridge et al., 2010</a>) to navigational tests (<a href=\"#bib20\">de Gelder et al., 2008</a>) and indirect or \u2018attentional\u2019 blindsight (<a href=\"#bib32\">Leh et al., 2006</a>). In particular, patients with extensive cortical damage beyond V1 appear to lack any awareness or direct response to blind field stimulation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tomaiuolo et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Leh et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">de Gelder et al., 2008</a>). Indirect blindsight assessments may be more sensitive than the 2-AFC tests used here, and may rely on different structures. The only way to tackle this would be to improve consistency amongst experiments, and to include multiple methods of assessing blindsight in future work."

Even if the \u2018true\u2019 fibre count is uniform, the number of reconstructed fascicles may differ due to the length, curvature, and degree of branching present (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jones and Cercignani, 2010</a>). Such variability was apparent here, as even control participants showed notable differences in fascicle numbers between hemispheres and individuals. Two of the key early papers on blindsight have focused on this measure (<a href=\"#bib32\">Leh et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bridge et al., 2008</a>), interpreting a quantitative difference in fascicles as suggestive of plasticity.

Although the interhemispheric and geniculate pathways in patients would remain unaffected, a less stringent cut-off would suggest collicular tracts were present in all blindsight positive patients. However, when visualized, these pathways containing fewer than 5 fascicles appear largely implausible, reinforcing the need for a cleaning process to improve data reliability and reduce false positives.

Although alternate interhemispheric and collicular pathways were also demonstrable in a number of patients, these connections were unable to account for all blindsight cases and were often found to be intact in patients with absent blindsight performance. The results also highlight the importance of considering white matter microstructure when performing tractography in patients, which is applicable to anyone working with clinical diffusion data. Finally, appreciation of the important tracts may help to direct attempts to boost residual function through rehabilitative strategies in hemianopia."

Stimulus contrast was altered parametrically between the five levels at random, with 20 trials per condition. The allocated interval (first or second) was also generated at random. Participants additionally performed a run of control testing, with stimuli presented to the equivalent location in their sighted visual field. Fixation was recorded throughout with an Eyelink 1000 eye tracker (SR Research Limited, Ontario, Canada), and any trials in which eye position exceeded 1\u00b0 from fixation were excluded from analysis. Participants were reminded to maintain fixation, with the investigator observing this in real-time. Anyone making even a small eye movement into their damaged hemifield was given specific instruction not to do so, and it was explained that these data would have to be discarded."

The diffusion weighting was isotropically distributed along the 60 directions (b-value = 1500 s/mm<sup>2</sup>), and a non-DWI (B0) image was acquired every 16 vol (total of four B0 volumes per image set). EPI acquisitions are prone to geometric distortions that can lead to errors in tractography. To minimise this, two image sets were acquired with the phase-encoded direction reversed, \u2018blip-up\u2019 and \u2018blip-down\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chang and Fitzpatrick, 1992</a>). This results in images with geometric distortions of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction allowing for the calculation of a corrected image (<a href=\"#bib6\">Andersson et al., 2003</a>). Before correcting for geometric distortions, each image set, blip-up and blip-down, was corrected for motion and eddy-current related distortions.

Average hMT+ ROI volume was 366 \u00b1 60 voxels in patients, 415 \u00b1 60 voxels in controls. For the LGN and superior colliculus, binary masks were created by manual inspection and drawing over the anatomical T1-weighted images (<a href=\"#bib25\">Horton et al., 1990</a>), using a radiological brain atlas to aid identification of landmarks. The average LGN volume in patients measured 245 mm<sup>3</sup> in the right, and 244 mm<sup>3</sup> in the left. In controls, average LGN volume was 245 mm<sup>3</sup> in the right and 236 mm<sup>3</sup> in the left.

Therefore, so-called fibre orientation distribution functions (fODF) were estimated in each voxel in the white matter using constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tournier et al., 2007</a>). A response function, representing the signal of a single coherent bundle of nerve fibres, was estimated as a lower-order (L<sub>max</sub> = 4) CSD fit to the signal from voxels in which FA was larger than 0.7. CSD was then fit to the entire white matter with this response function and maximum harmonic order (L<sub>max</sub>) was set to 8. The L<sub>max</sub> determines the maximal order of the spherical harmonics basis set used to estimate the fODF in each voxel by the CSD model. The number of coefficients for CSD grows with L<sub>max</sub>, as \u00bd (L<sub>max</sub>+1)(L<sub>max</sub>+2). The L<sub>max</sub> was set to 8 because this number requires a number of coefficients (45) lower than the number of diffusion directions used (60) and because it has been previously demonstrated that CSD-based probabilistic tractography using L<sub>max</sub> = 8 generates accurate connectomes (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yeatman et al., 2014</a>)."

Outlier fascicles were removed from tracts in each brain to retain a core fascicle bundle representing the most conservative estimate of the tract. To identify outlier fascicles, we calculated the Mahalanobis distance of nodes in each fascicle from the core fascicle bundle. This procedure assigned a weight to each fascicle depending on its distance from the core fascicle in standard deviations of the multivariate normal distribution. If the nodes in a fascicle were more than a predetermined number of standard deviations away from the core fascicles, then the fascicle was rejected as an outlier. This was performed using an iterative process to remove fascicles located more than 2.6 standard deviations away from the core of the tract, and more than 2.8 standard deviations longer than the mean tract length, using a Gaussian distribution to represent fascicle distance and length. Where this was not possible because of a small number of sparse fascicles &lt;10, this was interpreted as a failure to accurately track between the two regions of interest.

This model was fitted at each voxel to derive FA and MD maps, from which the mean and variation along any fascicle bundle could be calculated. FA provides a measure of the directionality of water molecule movement, which relates to the geometric organization of axons and fascicles in each voxel (e.g., crossing, merging or \u2018kissing\u2019 fibres), the degree of myelination of axons in the white matter (<a href=\"#bib11\">Beaulieu and Allen, 1994</a>), and their packing density (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sen and Basser, 2005</a>). In cases of brain damage, a decrease in FA can be indicative of loss of structural integrity of fibre bundles (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jones et al., 2013</a>), such as Wallerian degeneration (<a href=\"#bib12\">Beaulieu et al., 1996</a>). Similarly, increases in MD can indicate tissue damage, for example after a cerebral infarct (<a href=\"#bib54\">Werring et al., 2000</a>), and this measure is also sensitive to axon packing density and myelination (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sen and Basser, 2005</a>). Since both of these measures are sensitive to a number of tissue properties, but may not specifically be attributable to any one of them (see also <a href=\"#bib26\">Johansen-Berg, 2010</a> for review) we acknowledged that the precise interpretation of MD and FA is unknown. Therefore, the broad term \u2018white matter microstructure\u2019 is used to describe these measures."

The voxel-wise tensor parameters (FA and MD) were combined with the spatial information of the trajectory of tracts within the white matter to compute a tract profile. Tract profiles represented the average FA or MD of the voxels touched by the tract, weighted by the distance from the mean of the tract at each location. This was done by resampling each tract to 100 nodes, distributed equally along the length of the tract (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yeatman et al., 2012</a>). The region between nodes 15 and 85 was then used to represent \u2018whole tract\u2019 profiles, with the proximal and distal 15 nodes ignored to remove potential contamination with grey matter voxels or partial volume effects. This clipped tract profile was used to generate all subsequent measures of mean tract FA and MD. These measures were also used to calculate \u2018laterality\u2019, representing the relative difference in FA or MD measures for the same tracts in opposite hemispheres."

The 3-D lesion masks were binarised, and the total volume measured in mm<sup>3</sup>. We were also interested in estimating the distribution and extent of damage across the brain. Lobar masks were created using the MNI structural atlas in standard space for all four lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital) in both hemispheres and separately for the subcortex. Masks were transformed into individual structural space using non-linear transformation, similar to the technique to create ROIs. A region of overlap between the lesion and lobe masks was then quantified as a percentage of the total lobe volume."

Patients were categorized as displaying blindsight (PB, N = 12) or not (PN, N = 5) based on above chance detection of Gabor patches presented in their affected visual field. The results showed that ipsilesional LGN-hMT + tracts could be reconstructed in all subjects, except 1 PN patient. Investigations of the microstructure of the tract by means of FA and MD revealed normal values for the PBs and abnormal values for the PNs. In addition, the authors investigated 2 alternative projections, i.e. ipsilesional SC-hMT+ and transcallosal hMT+. These tracts could not be identified in all PB patients and all controls, whereas they were present in some PN patients. The authors interpret the results as evidence that an intact LGN-hMT + pathway is both a necessary and sufficient condition for blindsight."

We suspect that the differences between the two groups are even stronger than the authors indicate. It would be more efficient to analyze the data as a logistic regression within subject in which detection performance is measured as a function of contrast. That is use the model Log[(1-p)/p)] = a + b*percent contrast which can easily be fit by using standard statistical software."

Moreover, these tests are not described in the Methods. Can the authors give a bit better discussion in the Methods about what statistical paradigm they are using to make their inferences? Moreover, formal testing of group differences in both macro- and microstructural parameters of the 3 (or 4 if the suggested one is included) projections of interest could strengthen the claims of the authors, as well as correlation analyses between behavioral and imaging data. This is one of the largest collections of V1 lesion patients. Therefore the data should be analyzed in greater detail."

In both cases, statistical significance needed to surpass a threshold of p &lt; 0.01 using a cumulative binomial distribution. For each contrast level, trials were repeated 20 times. Therefore participants either had to score at least 16 correct responses for stimuli of 100% contrast, or at least 63/100 correct responses across all contrast levels. This meant that patients could be labelled as blindsight positive if they demonstrated a consistent performance above chance, even if this was not just for the highest contrast level.
