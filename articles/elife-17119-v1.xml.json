                    "text": "Myelination of axons facilitates rapid impulse propagation in the nervous system. The axon/myelin-unit becomes impaired in myelin-related disorders and upon normal aging. However, the molecular cause of many pathological features, including the frequently observed myelin outfoldings, remained unknown. Using label-free quantitative proteomics, we find that the presence of myelin outfoldings correlates with a loss of cytoskeletal septins in myelin. Regulated by phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>)-levels, myelin septins (SEPT2/SEPT4/SEPT7/SEPT8) and the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-adaptor anillin form previously unrecognized filaments that extend longitudinally along myelinated axons. By confocal microscopy and immunogold-electron microscopy, these filaments are localized to the non-compacted adaxonal myelin compartment. Genetic disruption of these filaments in <i>Sept8</i>-mutant mice causes myelin outfoldings as a very specific neuropathology. Septin filaments thus serve an important function in scaffolding the axon/myelin-unit, evidently a late stage of myelin maturation. We propose that pathological or aging-associated diminishment of the septin/anillin-scaffold causes myelin outfoldings that impair the normal nerve conduction velocity."

                    "text": "Myelination of axons facilitates rapid impulse propagation in the nervous system. The axon/myelin-unit becomes impaired in myelin-related disorders and upon normal aging. However, the molecular cause of many pathological features, including the frequently observed myelin outfoldings, remained unknown. Using label-free quantitative proteomics, we find that the presence of myelin outfoldings correlates with a loss of cytoskeletal septins in myelin. Regulated by phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>)-levels, myelin septins (SEPT2/SEPT4/SEPT7/SEPT8) and the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-adaptor anillin form previously unrecognized filaments that extend longitudinally along myelinated axons. By confocal microscopy and immunogold-electron microscopy, these filaments are localized to the non-compacted adaxonal myelin compartment. Genetic disruption of these filaments in <i>Sept8</i>-mutant mice causes myelin outfoldings as a very specific neuropathology. Septin filaments thus serve an important function in scaffolding the axon/myelin-unit, evidently a late stage of myelin maturation. We propose that pathological or aging-associated diminishment of the septin/anillin-scaffold causes myelin outfoldings that impair the normal nerve conduction velocity."

In vertebrates, rapid (\u2018saltatory\u2018) signal propagation is achieved by the myelination of axons. Myelination is largely completed before adulthood, notwithstanding that adult-born oligodendrocytes can assemble new myelin sheaths throughout life (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nave and Werner, 2014</a>). Yet, myelin is one of the most long-lived structures in the CNS (<a href=\"#bib45\">Toyama et al., 2013</a>). With age however, the abundance and dynamics of CNS myelin decreases (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lasiene et al., 2009</a>) while there is an increase in the frequency of pathological redundant myelin sheaths (<a href=\"#bib36\">Peters, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sturrock, 1976</a>), i.e., local outfoldings of compact myelin with normal-appearing axo-myelinic interface. These myelin outfoldings emerge from the innermost, adaxonal myelin layer, a part of the non-compacted, cytoplasmic channel system through myelin. This compartment of myelin has previously been implicated in glia-axonal metabolic coupling (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nave and Werner, 2014</a>). Analogous focal outfoldings of peripheral myelin are the pathological hallmark of tomaculous neuropathies affecting the PNS. The normal structure of myelin thus requires stabilization, which can fail upon normal aging and in myelin-related disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms that might prevent myelin outfoldings have remained unknown."

For example, abundant constituents of CNS myelin such as proteolipid protein (PLP), cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNP), and myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG), are not essential for the biogenesis of myelin per se but their deficiency in mice causes complex CNS pathology (<a href=\"#bib11\">Edgar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Griffiths et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Montag et al., 1994</a>). The neuropathological profiles observed in these and other myelin mutants are highly overlapping, which has made it difficult to explain distinct aspects of neuropathology by the loss of individual structural myelin proteins. Here, we followed the hypothesis that mutations of single genes can have secondary consequences for the entire protein composition of myelin, which allow elucidating the molecular cause of distinct neuropathological features."

This filament is composed of distinct septin monomers (SEPT2/SEPT4/SEPT7/SEPT8) and associated with the adaptor protein anillin (ANLN). The formation of myelin septin filaments is a late stage of myelin maturation, thereby avoiding that the property of septins to rigidify the membranes they are associated with (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gilden and Krummel, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tooley et al., 2009</a>) could hinder the normal developmental ensheathment of axons. Importantly, this sub-membranous septin/anillin-scaffold (SAS) is required for the normal structure of the axon/myelin unit in vivo\u00a0as its deficiency causes a specific structural impairment of the myelin sheath, myelin outfoldings, and reduced nerve conduction velocity. These findings were possible by systematic label-free myelin proteome analysis in several models of complex neuropathology."

When we immunoblotted myelin (purified from wild-type mouse brains at P10, P15, P21, P28, representing ongoing myelin maturation), the abundance of SEPT4, SEPT7, and SEPT8 increased with age whereas the abundance of the classical myelin markers PLP and myelin basic protein (MBP) did not change (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). When co-immunolabelling SEPT8 and MAG in optic nerves (ages P15, P21, P28), MAG was readily detectable at all examined ages (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Conversely, SEPT8 was detectable at P28 but not at P15 or P21 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Thus, the assembly of myelin septins represents a late stage of myelin maturation coinciding with a developmentally decreased frequency of myelin outfoldings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Considering the increase of myelin outfoldings in the aging brain ([<a href=\"#bib36\">Peters, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sturrock, 1976</a>] and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), we also assessed the abundance of septins (SEPT2, SEPT4, SEPT7, SEPT8) in myelin purified from wild-type mouse brains at two years of age.

Together, the developmental assembly of myelin septins represents a late stage of myelin maturation correlating with a reduced frequency of myelin outfoldings. On the other hand, the increase of myelin outfoldings with normal aging coincides with a reduced abundance of myelin septins."

Our data reveal that the assembly of septin filaments is a late stage of myelin maturation. By forming a scaffold underlying the innermost membrane layer of compact myelin, septins prevent outfoldings of the entire stack of compact myelin layers in the adult CNS. Septin filaments assemble by associating with membranes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bridges et al., 2014</a>) involving the interactions of particular septin monomers and the adaptor protein anillin with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bertin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhang et al., 1999</a>), a recruitment mechanism conserved between the yeast cleavage furrow and mammalian myelin. As submembraneous filaments, septins can provide structure and rigidity to the membranes they are associated with (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gilden and Krummel, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Spiliotis and Gladfelter, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tooley et al., 2009</a>). The adaxonal myelin compartment is regularly spaced, and the cytoplasmic surfaces of the flanking membranes are in close proximity but not compacted. Adaxonal myelin differs from compact myelin by lacking MBP and instead containing oligodendroglial cytoplasm. In our model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>), the septin/anillin scaffold stabilizes compact myelin by associating with its innermost membrane surface. This architecture counteracts hydrostatic pressure and lateral membrane flow (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gilden and Krummel, 2010</a>), which in the absence of adhesive forces would push compact myelin outward, e.g. as a consequence of the net growth of individual myelin membranes or the slow but lifelong intercalation of new myelin segments between existing sheaths (<a href=\"#bib49\">Young et al., 2013</a>)."

Loss of septins in the myelin sheath is likely owing to dysregulated filament assembly or stability, which in addition to membrane-phosphoinositides and ANLN may also involve other regulatory factors (<a href=\"#bib20\">Joberty et al., 2001</a>). Several mechanisms are thus feasible how mutations affecting structural myelin proteins may cause the post-transcriptional decrease of septins. For example, PLP is required for a normal myelin lipid composition (<a href=\"#bib46\">Werner et al., 2013</a>) and CNP prevents premature closure of the cytoplasmic channels through myelin (<a href=\"#bib40\">Snaidero et al., 2014</a>), which probably provide transport routes for molecules and vesicles into the adaxonal myelin layer (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nave and Werner, 2014</a>).

Moreover, neuronal and glial Ig-CAMs interact along the axon-myelin interface (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kinter et al., 2012</a>). We note that at the sites of pathological myelin outfoldings, the axo-myelinic membrane apposition is not disrupted. However, the lack of myelin septins causes the entire stack of compacted myelin to focally detach from the adaxonal oligodendroglial membrane and to \u2018fold out\u2018. This reflects strong adhesive forces between adjacent layers of compact myelin mediated by myelin proteins such as MBP. The non-compact compartments of myelin are considered as cytoplasmic routes enabling the axon-supportive function of oligodendrocytes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nave and Werner, 2014</a>). We conclude that the septin/anillin-scaffold reported here stabilizes mature CNS myelin while allowing diffusion and transport processes in the non-compact adaxonal myelin layer to take place."

Ultrathin sections (50 nm) were cut using a Leica Ultracut S ultramicrotome (Leica) and contrasted with an aqueous solution of 4% uranyl acetate (SPI Chem) followed by lead citrate. The\u00a0samples were examined in a LEO 912AB Omega transmission electron microscope (Zeiss). Pictures were taken with an on-axis 2048\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02048-CCD-camera (TRS)."

Electron micrographs were analyzed using ImageJ (Fiji). To quantify axonal pathology and the proportion of nonmyelinated axons, all axons on the micrographs (a minimum of 700 axons per animal) were assigned to one of five categories: healthy-appearing myelinated axons, healthy-appearing nonmyelinated axons, axons with myelin comprising a swollen adaxonal compartment (inner tongue), axonal spheroids, and degenerated axons. Axons were counted as myelinated if ensheathed by at least one complete layer of compacted myelin. Axonal changes were identified by mild signs of pathology including invaginations of adaxonal myelin membrane into the axon. Degenerated axons were identified by tubovesicular structures and amorphous cytoplasm. The area occupied by myelin outfoldings was quantified by a point counting method (<a href=\"#bib11\">Edgar et al., 2009</a>). Briefly, a regular grid of 0.25 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> was placed on the images. The number of intercepts coinciding with myelin outfoldings was related to the evaluated area. When quantifying myelinated axons, axonal pathology, axonal diameters, and myelin outfoldings, to compare <i>Cnp<sup>null</sup></i>, <i>Mag<sup>null</sup></i>, and <i>Plp1<sup>null</sup></i> mice with WT mice significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 6.0. To compare SEPT8 mutant mice with WT littermates, significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 6.0. The g-ratio was calculated as the ratio between the axonal Feret diameter and the Feret diameter of the corresponding myelin sheath. To determine g-ratios, a regular grid was placed on the images for randomization. All axons crossed by the grating were assessed, yielding a minimum of 100 myelinated axons per animal. The g-ratio was assessed using GraphPad Prism 6.0. All quantifications were performed blinded to the genotype."

Briefly, brains were dissected from three male <i>Cnp<sup>null</sup>, Mag<sup>null</sup>, Plp1<sup>null</sup></i>, or <i>Sept8<sup>null/null</sup></i> mice at the age of 75 days and three respective control littermates, and myelin was biochemically purified (see above). Per sample, 25 \u00b5g of total myelin protein was precipitated using the ProteoExtract Protein Precipitation Kit (Calbiochem), solubilized in 50\u2009mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> with 0.1% Rapigest (Waters) (10\u2009min, 85\u00b0C), reduced with 5\u2009mM DTT (45\u2009min, 56\u00b0C), and alkylated with 15\u2009mM iodoacetamide (45\u2009min, room temperature) in the dark. Solubilized proteins were digested with 0.5 \u00b5g of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) for 16\u2009hr (37\u00b0C). After digestion, Rapigest was hydrolyzed by adding 10\u2009mM HCl, the resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation (13,000\u2009<i>g</i>, 15\u2009min, 4\u00b0C), and the supernatant was transferred into an autosampler vial. Data for the analysis of myelin purified from <i>Cnp<sup>null</sup>, Plp1<sup>null</sup></i>, and <i>Sept8<sup>nul/nulll</sup></i> mice and the respective littermate controls were obtained using separation of tryptic peptides by nanoscale ultraperformance liquid chromatography (nanoUPLC) coupled to a quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) Premier mass spectrometer (Waters) with an alternating low and elevated (E) energy mode of acquisition (MS<sup>E</sup>) (UPLC-MS<sup>E</sup>). Data for the analysis of myelin purified from <i>Mag<sup>null</sup></i> mice and littermate controls were obtained using a Synapt G2S mass spectrometer (Waters). For each biological replicate, 2\u20134 technical replicates were measured. The continuum LC-MS<sup>E</sup> data were processed and searched using the IDENTITYE-algorithm of ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) version 2.3 (Waters). Protein identifications were assigned by searching the Uni-ProtKB/Swiss-Prot Protein Knowledgebase Release 52.3 for mouse proteins (12,920 entries) supplemented with known possible contaminants (porcine trypsin, human keratins) using the precursor and fragmentation data afforded by LC-MS acquisition as described previously (<a href=\"#bib35\">Patzig et al., 2011</a>). Mass tolerances for peptide and fragment ions were set at 15 and 30 ppm, respectively. Peptide identifications were restricted to tryptic peptides with no more than one missed cleavage. Carboxyamidomethylation of Cys was set as fixed modification, and oxidation of Met, acetylation of protein N termini, and deamidation of Asn and Gln were searched as variable modifications. For a valid protein identification, the following criteria had to be met: at least two peptides detected together with at least seven fragments. The false-positive rate for protein identification was set to 1% based on search of a 5x randomized database, which was generated automatically using PLGS 2.3 by reversing the sequence of each entry. By using the\u00a0replication rate as a filter, the false-positive rate was further minimized, as false-positive identifications do not tend to replicate across injections due to their random nature. By requiring a protein identification to be made in at least three technical replicates, the effective false-positive rate was lowered to &lt;0.2%. For label-free absolute quantification of protein abundance by mass spectrometry based on the TOP3-method (<a href=\"#bib38\">Silva et al., 2006</a>), data were post-processed using ISOQuant software (<a href=\"#bib9\">Distler et al., 2014</a>). The relative abundance of a protein in myelin was accepted as altered if both, significant according to unpaired two-tailed t-test and exceeding a threshold of 25%."

Electrophysiology was essentially as described (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dibaj et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Steffens et al., 2012</a>), with moderately modified surgery procedure. Briefly, anaesthesia was initiated by 80 mg/kg pentobarbital injected i.p. The\u00a0rectal body temperature was measured and kept at 37\u00b0C by a heated plate. After cannulation of the jugular vein, anesthesia was continued with 40\u201360 mg methohexital per kg and hour. Tracheotomy was performed, and a tube for artificial ventilation was inserted. Active respiratory movements were abolished by paralysis with pancuronium (800 \u00b5g per kg supplemented i.p. every hour) and artificial ventilation with a gas mixture of CO<sub>2</sub> (2.5%), O<sub>2</sub> (47.5%), and N<sub>2</sub> (50%) at 120 strokes/min (100\u2013160 \u00b5l/stroke depending on the body weight). The vertebral column was rigidly fixed with two custom-made clamps. Electrocardiograms were monitored throughout. Changes of heart rate and temperature were used to control the\u00a0anaesthetic state. Blood O<sub>2</sub> saturation was monitored by a sensor in the inguinal region (MouseOx system, Starr Live Sciences Corp.). Laminectomy was performed from vertebrae TH13 to L5 to expose spinal cord segments L1-L4 and dorsal roots L3-L5. For electrophysiology, the spinal cord was covered with mineral oil. Stimulation and recording were performed with bipolar platinum electrodes. Rectangular constant voltage pulses were used with a duration of 0.1 ms to stimulate dorsal root L4. Supramaximal stimulation strength of 5T was used, which is 5 times the electrical threshold for the lowest threshold fibres (T=threshold; thresholds were frequently tested and adjusted during the experiment). Recording was performed with a sampling rate of 50 kHz on the ipsilateral fasciculus gracilis at spinal cord level L1. The signal was appropriately pre-amplified and filtered. At the end of the experiment, the distance between the stimulation electrode (cathode) and the recording electrode was measured in situ by using a thin cotton thread."

Genetic disruption of Sept8 resulted in myelin outfoldings that have been observed in myelin related disorders and aging. The data are compelling and well presented and represent a significant advance for the myelin field and more broadly. The reviewers did not have substantive suggestions for additional experiments. Both raised a few questions and points for clarification that should included in the discussion of the revised manuscript. Once these and minor comments are addressed, this paper will make a valuable contribution to the field."

They then demonstrate through confocal microscopy and electron microscopy that septins form a filamentous structure that lines the adaxonal membrane of myelin. The septins also form a putative complex with Anillin, and the authors show that this protein colocalizes with septins and is dramatically reduced in the myelin mutants with outfoldings. Consistent with the idea that septin-anillin-phosphoinositide interactions are important, they show that <i>Pten</i> cKO mice have dramatic reductions in septins and anillin, and strikingly also have myelin outfoldings. Finally, the authors generate a septin8 conditional knockout and show that by removing septin8 from myelinating oligodendrocytes this results in myelin outfoldings and reduced nerve conduction velocity.
