The endocannabinoid (eCB) system has emerged as a pivotal pathway for synaptic plasticity because of its widely characterized ability to depress synaptic transmission on short- and long-term scales. Recent reports indicate that eCBs also mediate potentiation of the synapse. However, it is not known how eCB signaling may support bidirectionality. Here, we combined electrophysiology experiments with mathematical modeling to question the mechanisms of eCB bidirectionality in spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) at corticostriatal synapses. We demonstrate that STDP outcome is controlled by eCB levels and dynamics: prolonged and moderate levels of eCB lead to eCB-mediated long-term depression (eCB-tLTD) while short and large eCB transients produce eCB-mediated long-term potentiation (eCB-tLTP). Moreover, we show that eCB-tLTD requires active calcineurin whereas eCB-tLTP necessitates the activity of presynaptic PKA. Therefore, just like glutamate or GABA, eCB form a bidirectional system to encode learning and memory."

The endocannabinoid (eCB) system has emerged as a pivotal pathway for synaptic plasticity because of its widely characterized ability to depress synaptic transmission on short- and long-term scales. Recent reports indicate that eCBs also mediate potentiation of the synapse. However, it is not known how eCB signaling may support bidirectionality. Here, we combined electrophysiology experiments with mathematical modeling to question the mechanisms of eCB bidirectionality in spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) at corticostriatal synapses. We demonstrate that STDP outcome is controlled by eCB levels and dynamics: prolonged and moderate levels of eCB lead to eCB-mediated long-term depression (eCB-tLTD) while short and large eCB transients produce eCB-mediated long-term potentiation (eCB-tLTP). Moreover, we show that eCB-tLTD requires active calcineurin whereas eCB-tLTP necessitates the activity of presynaptic PKA. Therefore, just like glutamate or GABA, eCB form a bidirectional system to encode learning and memory."

Electrical stimulations that produced moderate amounts of endocannabinoids over a prolonged period led to synaptic depression.

The enzymes that control endocannabinoid levels thus play a crucial role in determining whether a given stimulation leads to the strengthening or weakening of a synaptic connection."

Bidirectionality is of paramount functional importance since it allows LTP and LTD to reverse each other with time at a single synapse, thus enabling adaptive changes of the synaptic weight. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) have emerged as a major actor in learning and memory because of their powerful influence on synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chevaleyre et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Heifets and Castillo, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kano et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Katona and Freund, 2012</a>). The eCB system is mainly composed of active biolipids (notably 2-arachidonylglycerol, 2-AG and anandamide, AEA) synthesized and released on-demand acting as retrograde neurotransmitters on presynaptic type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) and postsynaptic transient receptor potential vanilloid-type-1 (TRPV1) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Piomelli, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Piomelli et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Di Marzo, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alger and Kim, 2011</a>)."

In contrast, eCBs have been widely described as a powerful unidirectional system that depresses neuronal communication on a short or long timescale. However, recent reports challenge this view and indicate that eCBs could also act as a bidirectional system for synaptic plasticity. We recently reported the existence of an eCB-mediated spike-timing dependent LTP in the dorsal striatum induced by a low number of paired stimulations and dependent on the activation of CB1R and TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al, 2015</a>). We found that few coincident pre- and post-synaptic spikes (5\u201315) were sufficient to increase synaptic efficacy through a signaling pathway that relies on the activation of CB1R and TRPV1 and on 2-AG elevations. The latter are triggered by coupled postsynaptic rises of calcium and DAG lipase \u03b1 (DAGL\u03b1) activity mediated by type-5 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR5), muscarinic M1 receptors and voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al, 2015</a>). In addition, it has been reported an indirect role of eCBs in promoting LTP at mixed (chemical and electrical) synapses of the goldfish Mauthner cell via intermediary dopaminergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cachope et al., 2007</a>) or at hippocampal CA1 synapses via a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated mechanism (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Xu et al., 2012</a>). Likewise, facilitation of LTP in the hippocampus via eCB-induced presynaptic depression of GABAergic transmission (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carlson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhu and Lovinger, 2007</a>), and mediation of heterosynaptic short-term potentiation via intermediary astrocytes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Navarrete and Araque, 2010</a>) have been reported. There\u00a0exists a growing body of evidence that paves the way for a bidirectional action of eCBs in synaptic plasticity depending on the activity pattern on either side of the synapse."

In this aspect, MAG-lipase appears as a key controller of synaptic plasticity. Our results considerably enlarge the spectrum of action of eCBs since they show that eCBs not only promote depression but also potentiation, i.e. they act as a bidirectional system, depending on the regime of activity pattern on either side of the synapse."

Corticostriatal synapses are known to exhibit a bidirectional eCB-dependent STDP in which tLTP or tLTD can be obtained depending on the spike timing (\u0394t<sub>STDP</sub>) but also on the number of pairings (N<sub>pairings</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fino et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Shen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pawlak and Kerr, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fino et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Paill\u00e9 et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2015</a>). In agreement with those reports, we obtained a bidirectional plasticity when we induced STDP with 100 pairings in medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs): post-pre pairings (-30&lt;\u0394t<sub>STDP</sub>&lt;0\u00a0ms) induced tLTP (mean value of the EPSC amplitude recorded 50\u2009min after STDP protocol: 156\u00b115%, p=0.0015, n=19), while pre-post pairings (0&lt;\u0394t<sub>STDP</sub>&lt;+30\u00a0ms) induced tLTD (76\u00b18%, p=0.0051, n=11) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B, C1-2 and D1-2</a>). Note that this STDP displays an anti-hebbian polarity in accordance with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fino et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fino et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schulz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Paill\u00e9 et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2015</a>) but not with other studies (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pawlak and Kerr, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Shen et al., 2008</a>) at corticostriatal synapses\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Fino and Venance, 2010</a>). We have previously shown that GABA acts as an Hebbian/anti-Hebbian switch (<a href=\"#bib38\">Paill\u00e9 et al., 2013</a>), so polarity of the corticostriatal STDP depends on whether GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists are applied (Hebbian STDP; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pawlak and Kerr, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Shen et al., 2008</a>) or not (anti-Hebbian STDP; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fino et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fino et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib20\">Fino and Venance, 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2015</a>; this study). Examples of tLTP and tLTD induced by 100 post-pre and 100 pre-post pairings are shown in C1 and D1, respectively, and the experiment summary in C2 and D2. tLTP was NMDAR-mediated since blocked by the selective NMDAR blocker D-AP5 (50\u00a0\u03bcM) (99\u00b13%, p=0.7998, n=4) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C2</a>). while tLTD relied on eCBs because pharmacological inhibition of CB1R with AM251 (3\u00a0\u03bcM) impaired this plasticity (102\u00b17%, p=0.8108, n=4) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D2</a>). As recently reported (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2015</a>), lowering the number of pairings down to 10 yields tLTP for post-pre pairings (163\u00b112%, p&lt;0.0001, n=25) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> with an example of LTP induced by 10 post-pre pairings in E1 and the experiment summary in E2) and a lack of significant plasticity for pre-post pairings (97\u00b111%, p=0.3844, n=8). tLTP induced with 10 post-pre STDP pairings was CB1R-mediated since treatment with AM251 (3\u00a0\u03bcM) resulted in an absence of significant plasticity (88\u00b111%, p=0.3073, n=5) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E2</a>). Based on this eCB-dependence, we refer to the tLTP triggered by 10 post-pre pairings as eCB-tLTP."

To address this question, we built a realistic mathematical model of the molecular mechanisms of corticostriatal synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Our model is based on the two signaling pathways involved in corticostriatal STDP induced by 100 pairings: NMDAR- and CB1R-signaling (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pawlak and Kerr, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Shen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fino et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Paill\u00e9 et al., 2013</a>). NMDAR-tLTP is CaMKII-dependent since we found that pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII with KN62 (3\u00a0\u00b5M) blocked NMDAR-tLTP (88 \u00b1 11%, p=0.3324, n=6) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We thus combined in the model a first signaling pathway leading from NMDAR to calmodulin and CaMKII with a second, distinct one that assembles mGluR and cytosolic calcium to eCB production and the resulting activation of CB1R (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Most of the parameter values were restricted by previous experimental measurements (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

The postsynaptic contribution to the synaptic weight, <i>W<sub>post</sub></i> is taken proportional to the amount of CaMKII activated by the NMDAR pathway. This part of our model (from <a href=\"#bib22\">Graupner and Brunel, 2007</a>) exhibits bistable dynamics between a down state where CaMKII is inactive and an up state where CaMKII is highly activated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B1</a>). Transitions between those two states therefore emulate transitions between no plasticity (down state) and NMDAR-tLTP (up state). The time scale of CaMKII dephosphorylation after a pairing being larger than the period between two successive pairings (1 sec), the amounts of activated CaMKII progressively accumulates with the number of pairings. Importantly, the level of activated CaMKII needs 50\u201360 post-pre pairings (with \u0394t<sub>STDP</sub>=-15\u00a0ms) to reach the threshold between the up and down states (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B1</a>).

For pre-post pairings, the calcium response after each pairing activates less of the CaMKII-activating calmodulin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) so the amount of activated CaMKII never reaches the threshold for the up state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B2</a>). Thus, the model predicts no NMDAR-dependent for pre-post pairings (0<n<sub>pairings</n<sub>&lt;100 at 1\u00a0Hz, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C2</a>), in agreement with experimental observations (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2015</a>)."

During the first 10\u201320 pairings, repeated activation of mGluRs progressively increases the quantity of IP<sub>3</sub>, which contributes an extra influx of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. This boost of cytoplasmic calcium however progressively disappears when N<sub>pairings</sub> increases further because the concentration of calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum decreases.

This result is not predicted by the model, for which the tLTP induced by 10 post-pre pairings vanishes quickly below 1\u00a0Hz. At frequencies &gt;1\u00a0Hz, we observed tLTP for 10 post-pre pairings at 2.5\u00a0Hz (161\u00b115, n=23, p=0.0004) and 4\u00a0Hz (165\u00b114, n=22, p=0.0001), but also for pre-post pairings at 2.5\u00a0Hz (130\u00b114, n=12, p=0.0490 for \u0394t<sub>STDP</sub>&lt;+50\u00a0ms; 119\u00b19, n=20, p=0.060 for \u0394t<sub>STDP</sub>&lt;+100\u00a0ms) and 4\u00a0Hz (139\u00b113, n=10, p=0.0150).

Therefore, when we increased the frequency of the pairings to 2.5 or 4\u00a0Hz, our experimental results show a very good match with the prediction of the model: we observed first a symmetric Hebbian plasticity, i.e. the induction of tLTP not only for post-pre but also for pre-post pairings, and, secondly an enlargement of the range of \u0394t<sub>STDP</sub> in which plasticity was observed."

Indeed, our model predicts that MAGL inhibition may turn a STDP protocol that yields no plastic change in control conditions into eCB-tLTP. For this purpose, we chose a STDP pairing for which we detected no plasticity in control conditions: i.e. 50 post-pre pairings (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A3</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2015</a>). <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A3</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> illustrates this 'plasticity gap' (the zone between 40 and 60 pre-post pairings that separates the two LTP domains). In silico the control STDP protocol (50 pairings with \u0394t<sub>STDP</sub>=-15\u00a0ms) does not trigger any plasticity but when MAG lipase is inhibited, eCB-tLTP emerges (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Experimentally, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2015</a>), STDP protocols with 50 post-pre pairings failed to induce any plasticity in control conditions as illustrated by the representative and average STDP (101\u00b17%, p=0.9030, n=13) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B and D</a>; with an example of an absence of plasticity for 50 post-pre pairings at \u0394t<sub>STDP</sub>=-20\u00a0ms in B and the experiment summary in D). As predicted by the model, we found that 50 post-pre pairings under inhibition of MAGL with JZL184 (1.5\u00a0\u03bcM) induced tLTP (139\u00b115%, p=0.0248, n=9) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C and D</a>; with an example of tLTP induced by 50 post-pre pairings at \u0394t<sub>STDP</sub>=-16\u00a0ms with JZL184 and the experiment summary in D).

Therefore, by acting on the 2-AG levels, we were able to trigger eCB-tLTP for an activity pattern, which does not generate LTP in control conditions."

However, if we decrease the maximal rates of MAGL and DAG kinase activity (the major source of DAG consumption in the model), we obtain a robust eCB-tLTP, even in the absence of any postsynaptic stimulation.

Computational models of STDP can be clustered into two families. A first group of models aims at predicting the consequences of STDP on e.g. neuronal receptive fields or network dynamics (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clopath et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Costa et al., 2015</a>). In those models, the function describing weight changes with spike timing is usually given as hypothesis of the model. A second group of models starts from the signaling pathways implied in STDP and aims at understanding how the function describing weight changes with spike timing emerges from those signaling pathways (see e.g. <a href=\"#bib23\">Graupner and Brunel, 2010</a> for a review). In a number of models in this second group, intracellular signaling is actually restricted to cytoplasmic calcium variation, thus implementing calcium-control hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shouval et al., 2002</a>). The mathematical models that consider signaling downstream of calcium usually account for a single intracellular signaling pathway (i.e. a single coincidence detector), most often NMDAR-CAMKII (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rubin et al, 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">Graupner and Brunel, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Urakubo et al., 2008</a>). Noticeable exceptions are for instance <a href=\"#bib30\">Karmarkar and Buonomano (2002)</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib16\">Evans et al., 2012</a>\u00a0or <a href=\"#bib38\">Paill\u00e9 et al. (2013)</a>, where the calcium pool entering via NMDAR controls tLTP whereas the calcium pool entering though VSCCs controls tLTD, thus implementing two coincidence detectors. However those models do not consider the signaling pathways beyond calcium entry through NMDAR and VSCC. Our mathematical model belongs to the latter group. To our knowledge, this is the first model to incorporate two detailed signaling pathways to account for STDP: NMDAR-CAMKII (with calmodulin, PKA, CaN and PP1) for tLTP and the eCB system for tLTD and tLTP. In the model, the eCB system comprises mGluR5, PLC\u03b2, DAGL, MAGL, DAG-Kinase, calcium-induced calcium release (IP3R channels, SERCA pumps), IP3 dynamics (PLC\u03b4, PI3K), VSCC, TRPV1R and CB1R (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Thank to this very fine grain description, the present mathematical model is able to predict the weight change when any of the STDP parameters is varied, that\u00a0is, not only spike timing \u0394t<sub>STDP</sub>, but also N<sub>pairings</sub> and frequency. This capacity has allowed us to explore a novel form of plasticity, eCB-LTP, induced by a low number of post-pre pairings at 1\u00a0Hz (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2015</a>; the present study)."

A classical view assesses that with enough parameters, one can fit any data set, whatever the equations used. This view however does not apply in our case because we constrained the model with experimental data embedded in a three-dimensional parameter space (\u0394t<sub>STDP</sub>, N<sub>pairings</sub> and frequency). In these conditions of strong constraining by experimental data, our parameter estimations systematically converged to a unique scenario that features two fundamentals: (<i>i</i>) eCB-transients allow bidirectional eCB plasticity whereby tLTD is triggered by moderate levels of eCB while high-amplitude eCB transients yield LTP and (<i>ii</i>) large eCB-transients are obtained for low numbers of pairings (for 5<n<sub>pairings</n<sub>&lt;20 at 1\u00a0Hz) while for larger number of pairings (N<sub>pairings</sub>&gt;40 pairings at 1\u00a0Hz) reduced calcium influx from internal stores and/or CB1R desensitization curtails the amplitude of the eCB-transients. We confirmed this prediction experimentally by two means: eCB puffs with different concentrations and durations, and MAGL inhibition in various conditions. Highly concentrated short puffs of 2-AG indeed yielded LTP in the absence of any electrical stimulation whereas less concentrated prolonged 2-AG puffs produced LTD. By decreasing MAGL activity, thus favoring high 2-AG levels, we could increase the magnitude of eCB-tLTP (5 post-pre pairings), induce eCB-tLTP at 50 post-pre pairings or even switch eCB-LTD to eCB-tLTP (100 presynaptic stimulations). Therefore, under MAGL inhibition, the temporal coincidence between pre- and postsynaptic spikes is not mandatory anymore for the induction of long-term plasticity. This discovery may have far-reaching consequences, since it means that the\u00a0manipulation of MAGL activity may bootstrap synaptic plasticity in synapses where the postsynaptic neuron is silent, thus rescuing possible pathological situations or waking up new local circuits. Further work is however needed to check the realism of this implication in vivo\u00a0but it is noteworthy that recently, nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling in cholinergic projection neurons of fetal mice has been shown to control MAGL degradation in vivo and in vitro in a spatially specific way (<a href=\"#bib32\">Keimpema et al., 2013</a>). In light of our findings, these results suggest that the regulation of MAGL activity may indeed be a potent mechanism to control synaptic plasticity and thus learning and memory."

Both the amplitude (\u2243165%) and the pharmacology (suppression by CB1R antagonist AM251) of the LTP observed with these puffs are identical to those observed for tLTP triggered by 10 post-pre pairings. Moreover, it is important to note that when we applied 2-AG in the form of prolonged puffs (x100), we observed LTD instead of LTP. According to our mathematical model, this behavior would be due to desensitization of the CB1R that becomes prominent with prolonged puffs. 2-AG puff application is therefore generally expected to give rise to depression except if the puffs are of short duration, where potentiation can be observed. This feature may account for the widespread observation that prolonged applications of 2-AG systematically yielded to LTD and might explain why eCB-dependent potentiation has proven difficult to observe experimentally."

In comparison, our modeling of the synaptic machinery and the electrophysiological response of the MSN neurons have been less sophisticated. For instance, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a> shows that 100 presynaptic stimulations at 1\u00a0Hz, in the absence of post-synaptic stimulation, are sufficient to trigger eCB-LTD experimentally. This is likely due to the production of eCB resulting from the postsynaptic depolarization triggered by the 100 presynaptic stimulations (depolarization-induced LTD). In the model however, the postsynaptic depolarization triggered by 100 presynaptic stimulations at 1\u00a0Hz is not large enough to allow the entry of the minimal amount of calcium that is needed to overcome the eCB-LTD threshold, so no plasticity is observed."

Since our mathematical model features none of these frequency dependencies, we cannot expect a precise quantitative match between experiments and model when frequency is varied. However, it is remarkable that the model still yields correct predictions of the main qualitative trends observed in the experiments. For instance, 10 post-pre pairings at very low frequency (0.1\u00a0Hz) are sufficient to trigger tLTP in the experiments, while the model predicts no plasticity at those frequencies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). At 4\u00a0Hz, the experimental pharmacology profile with 10 pairings is not matched by the model with 10 pairings, but with 15 pairings (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Nevertheless, the model predictions that increased frequency should witness <i>i</i>) an enlarged range for the expression of tLTP with post-pre 10 pairings and <i>ii</i>) the emergence of a new tLTP with 10 pre-post pairings turned out to be generally correct."

                        "text": "In the hippocampus, theta-burst stimulation induces eCB-dependent LTD at the synapse between inhibitory interneurons and pyramidal cells that is blocked when presynaptic CaN is inhibited (<a href=\"#bib27\">Heifets et al., 2008</a>). Similarly, we found that eCB-tLTD triggered at the corticostriatal synapse also needs CaN activity. In our experiments, we could not estimate the localization of the CaN that mediated eCB-LTD (pre or postsynaptic) but it is likely that in analogy with theta-burst STDP in the hippocampus, the implied CaN would be presynaptic. The implication of PKA in eCB-LTD is less clear. In the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chevaleyre et al, 2007</a>) and nucleus accumbens (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mato et al., 2008</a>), the expression of frequency-dependent eCB-LTD is blocked when cAMP levels are increased by the adenylyl-cyclase activator forskolin. Since PKA is activated by cAMP, this indicates that reduced levels of PKA are necessary for eCB-LTD. In both cases however, direct inhibition of presynaptic PKA actually blocks the expression of eCB-LTD, thus showing that the implication of PKA in eCB-dependent plasticity is a complex and subtle phenomenon. In the case of tLTD in the dorsolateral striatum, we found that direct PKA inhibition does not obliterate eCB-tLTD. Our result is, therefore, in line with the notion that the expression of eCB-tLTD requires PKA inhibition. Strikingly, the eCB-tLTP triggered at the corticostriatal synapse by STDP protocols had the exact inverse dependence on PKA and CaN compared to eCB-tLTD. Indeed, we found that PKA inhibitors block eCB-tLTP expression whereas CaN inhibition has no effect. Therefore, our study of STDP protocols at the corticostriatal synapse shows that the expression of eCB-tLTD needs CaN (but not PKA) activity whereas the expression of eCB-tLTP demands PKA (but not CaN) activity. Whether the same or two separate pathways support eCB-tLTD and eCB-tLTP is still a pending question which resolution is rendered highly challenging by the difficult access to the molecular mechanisms occurring in the presynaptic compartment of the corticostriatal synapses. However, we can propose a simplified schematic mechanism (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). CB1R activation inhibits PKA activity but also inhibits presynaptic VSCCs (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mato et al., 2008</a>), which are expected to hamper calcium influx in the presynaptic compartment. Such a decrease in calcium levels reduces the CaN activity. CB1R activation is expected to reduce both CaN and PKA activity, although the shapes (kinetics parameters) of the decays of PKA and CaN activity with increasing CB1R activation are not necessarily identical. For example, in <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, PKA activity dominates CaN when CB1R activation is large, whereas CaN dominates for a range of intermediate CB1R activations. Considering our experimental data, this putative mechanism suggests that eCB-STDP is gated by the ratio between PKA and CaN activities: large CB1R activation would produce high values of the PKA/CaN ratio yielding eCB-tLTP whereas intermediate CB1R activations would result in low values of the PKA/CaN ratio and, consequently, in eCB-tLTD. Future experimental investigation is needed to test the validity of this proposed mechanism."

Altogether, our results show that eCB bidirectional plasticity constitutes a versatile system, which operation may underlie a complex repertoire of learning abilities, depending on activity pattern at corticostriatal circuits and on the behavioral context."

Electrical stimulations were monophasic at constant current (ISO-Flex stimulator, AMPI, Jerusalem, Israel). Currents were adjusted to evoke 50-200pA EPSCs. Repetitive control stimuli were applied at 0.1\u00a0Hz. STDP protocols consisted in pairings of pre- and postsynaptic stimulations with the two events separated by a specific temporal interval (\u0394<i>t</i>). The paired stimulations were applied at 1\u00a0Hz throughout the study except in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> in which 0.1, 1.0, 2.5 and 4.0\u00a0Hz were tested. Presynaptic stimulations corresponded to cortical stimulations and the postsynaptic stimulation of an action potential evoked by a depolarizing current step (30\u00a0ms duration) in MSNs. MSNs were maintained all along the STDP experiments at a constant holding membrane potential which corresponds to their initial resting membrane potential (-75\u00b10.5\u00a0mV, n=110). Thus, EPSCs during baseline or after STDP protocol were measured at the same membrane potential (in voltage-clamp mode); STDP pairings (performed in current-clamp mode) were conducted also at this same holding membrane potential. Neurons were recorded for 10\u2009min during baseline and for at least 60\u2009min after STDP protocol; long-term synaptic efficacy changes were measured from 45\u00a0to\u00a0-50\u2009min. Thirty successive EPSCs (at 0.1\u00a0Hz) were individually measured and then averaged. Variation of series resistance, measured every 10 sec all along the experiment, beyond 20% led to the rejection of the experiment. For pharmacology experiments, after recording of 10\u2009min control baseline, drugs were applied in the bath. A new baseline with drugs was recorded after a time lapse of 10\u2009min (to allow the drug to be fully perfused) for 10\u2009min before the STDP protocol. Drugs were present until the end of the recording (except when specified for AM251*). In a subset of experiments (for i-KT5720 and i-PKI 6-22) drugs were applied intracellularly through the patch-clamp pipette.

Originally, this model was developed to simulate hippocampal STDP, whereas our study is targeted to the striatum and MSNs in which protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is inhibited by the striatum-specific subunit PPP1R1B (DARPP-32) rather than subunit PPP1R1A (Inhibitor-1). However, for the sake of simplicity (and since postsynaptic dopamine signaling is not explicitly considered here), we kept the equations and most of the parameters of <a href=\"#bib22\">Graupner and Brunel (2007)</a>. Our major change concerns PKA activation by calcium. Beyond the expression of DARPP-32, another specificity of MSNs is to express the B72 regulatory subunit of PP2A at high levels in lieu of B56. This striatum-specific regulatory subunit provides PP2A with calcium-activation properties (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahn et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, calcium elevations in MSNs are expected to activate B72-PP2A. Active PP2A then can dephosphorylate DARPP-32 (at Tyr75), which would in turn disinhibit PKA. This process results in an effective activation of PKA by calcium, that is modeled in the <a href=\"#bib22\">Graupner and Brunel (2007)</a> model via a Hill function of calcium with exponent <i>n<sub>PKA</sub></i>=8. More recent experimental evidence (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahn et al., 2007</a>) rather points to a lower value (2\u20133). We therefore changed for <i>n<sub>PKA</sub></i>=3."

The corresponding quasi-steady state assumption on NAPE concentration (<i>dNAPE/dt</i> \u2248 0) then simplifies the expression of <i>AEA</i> dynamics to a single equation:"

The paper is distinctive in presenting several high-level tests of the signaling model, including some non-obvious predictions. The authors present MAGL activity as a key controller of synaptic plasticity, and suggest that endocannabinoid receptors may be important in bidirectional regulation of plasticity."

The key step here (thresholding) is not implemented biophysically or biochemically, but by a mathematical threshold. I think this weakens their case for a mechanistic account of STDP. The authors discuss this and have a schematic in Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1, but I don't feel that the proposed sharp thresholds are physiological. I would have liked to see a chemical implementation of the thresholds. Specifically, I am concerned that the presence of a shallow (more chemical-like) turn on rather than a sharp all-or-none threshold may invalidate the results. The authors should address this."

Here, in fact, a shallower activation function to replace the threshold might prove to be more robust, but less precise."

As pointed out by the reviewer, in its current state, the model does a very good job in predicting the final (long-term) amplitude of STDP. But it cannot reliably be used to predict the time course of the synaptic weight after the pairings because our knowledge of many of the molecular processes involved in plasticity maintenance and expression downstream of CaMKII and CB1R are still not known with enough detail. For the NMDAR-CaMKII part, the signaling pathway from glutamate to CaMKII activation is rather well characterized but the molecular mechanisms leading from CaMKII activation to changes of the synaptic weights are still unclear, especially in MSNs (direct AMPAR activation, alterations of AMPAR or NMDAR trafficking, other modifications of the anchoring/scaffolding properties of the PSD?). Likewise, for the mGluR-eCB-CB1R pathway it is not clear what are the molecular targets that are set in motion following CB1R-triggered activation of PKA or/and inhibition of VGCCs and that lead to changes of the presynaptic weight. In these conditions, it would seem rather pointless to propose a model to predict the temporal evolution of the synaptic weights. By contrast, our results strongly suggest the validity of the assumption that the steady-state (long-term) values of the pre- and post-synaptic weight is proportional to the amount of activated CB1R and CaMKII, respectively, so that predicting the (long-term) amplitude of STDP is still possible."

As a first approach, we have studied and applied STDP protocols where spike timing, i.e. the time between pre and post pairings is not deterministic/Dirac distributed but a random variable. With increasing variance of these random spike timings and at 1\u2009Hz, the model shows a striking differential behavior: whereas NMDAR-LTP is very sensitive and disappears quickly when variance increases, eCB-dependent plasticity (eCB-LTD and eCB-LTP) remains expressed for a much larger amount of noise. This results is however also frequency-dependent since for larger frequencies, NMDAR-LTP becomes much more resilient. Importantly, here again, the predictions of our model have been validated by experiments, which confirm the major trends of the model. Thus, we agree that stochasticity counter STDP expression in the model, but more importantly: i) noise differentially affects eCB-dependent and NMDAR-dependent plasticity and ii) this effect is also observed experimentally. We did not include these results in the present version of this manuscript because we feel the revised version already contains a large amount of information so adding the study of stochasticity on top of it would only go against the clarity of the paper.

Considering the good match with our experiments, this seems a posteriori a valid hypothesis. Regarding bidirectionality, since our model for the NDMAR pathway is based on the model by Graupner and Brunel, 2007, it has inherited its potentiality to implement both LTP and LTD, depending on the stimulation. However, we have been undertaking experimental studies of STDP of the corticostriatal synapses in slices for some time now, but we never observed notable NMDAR-dependent LTD (at least in \"control\" conditions, i.e. in the absence of GABA or transporter blockers).

In the original version, DAG-Lipase activation by calcium occurred via DAG-Lipase phosphorylation catalyzed by a kinase (and the reverse phosphatase), that was itself calcium-activated. In the revised version, we replaced this unnecessary complex scheme by direct activation of DAG-Lipase by calcium (equation 12). Note that we could have pushed further in this simplification effort by removing DAG-Lipase entirely and e.g. assuming a simple unimolecular reaction for 2-AG production, such as DAG \u2192 2-AG. However, since our previous results (Cui et al., 2015) show that specific inhibition of DAG-lipase suppresses eCB-LTP, we decided to keep the explicit account of DAG-Lipase activation in the revised model."

Indeed, the effects of CICR develop progressively as IP3 accumulates during the successive pairings and is not sensible for the first stimulation. Contribution through TRPV1 is as well negligible since TRPV1 needs AEA to open and AEA starts to be large enough for this only in the next pairings. Calcium flux through VDCCs is important for post-pre pairings but also for pre-post ones, since its absence annihilates the global calcium influx during the bAP. Finally NMDAR is responsible for the majority of the calcium influx during the EPSP. We propose not to include those results in the revised manuscript, because we feel the revised version already contains a large amount of information and adding this figure would too much interrupt the reading flow of the manuscript. But we would accept to integrate it in the manuscript, in case the reviewer and editor find it necessary."

This striatum-specific regulatory subunit provides B72-PP2A with calcium-activation properties (see e.g. Ahn et al., 2007). Therefore, calcium elevations in MSNs are expected to activate PP2A. Active PP2A can then dephosphorylate DARPP-32 on its pThr75 site, which disinhibits PKA (see e.g. the modeling studies by Lindskog et al., PLoS Comput Biol 2006 or Gutierrez-Arenas et al., PLoS Comput Biol 2014)."
