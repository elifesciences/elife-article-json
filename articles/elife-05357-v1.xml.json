The branched character of their respiratory chains allows bacteria to do so by providing a great metabolic and regulatory flexibility. Here, we show that the native localization of the nitrate reductase, a major respiratory complex under anaerobiosis in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, is submitted to tight spatiotemporal regulation in response to metabolic conditions via a mechanism using the transmembrane proton gradient as a cue for polar localization. These dynamics are critical for controlling the activity of nitrate reductase, as the formation of polar assemblies potentiates the electron flux through the complex. Thus, dynamic subcellular localization emerges as a critical factor in the control of respiration in bacteria."

The branched character of their respiratory chains allows bacteria to do so by providing a great metabolic and regulatory flexibility. Here, we show that the native localization of the nitrate reductase, a major respiratory complex under anaerobiosis in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, is submitted to tight spatiotemporal regulation in response to metabolic conditions via a mechanism using the transmembrane proton gradient as a cue for polar localization. These dynamics are critical for controlling the activity of nitrate reductase, as the formation of polar assemblies potentiates the electron flux through the complex. Thus, dynamic subcellular localization emerges as a critical factor in the control of respiration in bacteria."

At the cellular level, it is a molecular process that produces a high-energy molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using the biochemical energy stored in sugars, fatty acids, and other nutrients. Along with the ATP, this process also provides another source of energy to the cell: an electrochemical gradient across the membrane used for a range of processes ranging from the transport of molecules and ions to cell motility."

A cell must therefore have the ability to increase or decrease cellular respiration and the production of ATP to ensure it has an appropriate supply of energy. In bacteria, the protein complexes responsible for cellular respiration are embedded in the cell membrane. In the past decade, research has suggested that large molecules are arranged in a specific way throughout the bacterial cell, which directly influences how they work."

This allowed the complex to be tracked when the cells were viewed using a microscope. The experiments revealed that the location of the complex varies depending on how much energy the cell requires. For example, when the cells are in an oxygen-poor environment, the nitrate reductase complex moves towards the poles at each end of the bacterial cells. This allows the cells to produce ATP more efficiently through respiration of nitrate. Alberge et al. show that a \u2018proton gradient\u2019, caused by positively charged hydrogen ions moving through the cell membrane as the result of respiration, controls where the complexes are located in the membrane."

The free energy derived from oxidation of reducing equivalents generated by cell metabolism or taken up from the environment is converted into a protonmotive force (<i>pmf</i>) across a membrane that is used, among many processes, to drive adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Although oxygen is the most common terminal electron acceptor of respiratory chains, prokaryotes can make use of alternative acceptors in anoxic environments, such as nitrogen oxides, elemental sulfur and sulfur oxyanions, organic N-oxides, etc. In eukaryotes, respiration is confined to a specific organelle, the mitochondrion and more specifically to its inner membrane which displays remarkably intricate ultra-structural features that impact the respiratory output (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cogliati et al., 2013</a>). Respiration involves multimeric membrane-embedded oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes which bear several metal cofactors through which electrons are transported. The organization of OXPHOS complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane has been the subject of intense debate during the last decade after the discovery of supramolecular assemblies by the landmark study of Sch\u00e4gger in 2000 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sch\u00e4gger and Pfeiffer, 2000</a>), later substantiated by electron microscopy studies (for a review, see <a href=\"#bib34\">Vonck and Schafer, 2009</a>). Plasticity of the almost linear mitochondrial OXPHOS chain is ensured by a dynamic equilibrium between isolated complexes and supramolecular assemblies which is, in turn, influenced by both specific lipids and stabilizing factors (<a href=\"#bib37\">Zhang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ikeda et al., 2013</a>). Such an equilibrium is likely beneficial for the function of the mitochondrion allowing the cell to respond to cellular and environmental cues. Moreover, the extraordinarily low degradation rate of OXPHOS complexes in mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib25\">Price et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kim et al., 2012</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib22\">Nelson et al., 2013</a>) reinforces the idea that the dynamic association into supercomplexes adds an effective switch to control electron flows in response to environmental changes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013</a>). The flexibility of energy metabolism is also critical for the adaptation of a number of prokaryotes to varying environments (<a href=\"#bib33\">Unden et al., 2014</a>). The utilization of modular OXPHOS chains confers flexibility depending on the available energy source or terminal electron acceptor but also allows modulation of the resulting <i>pmf</i>. So far, the adjustment of respiration to varying environments in prokaryotes is considered to be the result of an intricate transcriptional regulation network that controls the expression of OXPHOS complexes with varying electrogenic capacities."

                        "text": "A major difference between the metabolic conditions studied above is the resulting <i>pmf</i>, based on the distinct proton transfer capabilities of the OXPHOS complexes involved. The present finding imparts particular significance to the previous reports that <i>pmf</i> can play a role in protein localization in bacteria (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alcock et al., 2013</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib27\">Rose et al., 2013</a>). Saliently, the dissipation of the electric component of the <i>pmf</i>, the transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03a8), hampers proper localization of proteins involved in cell division, chromosome segregation or cell shape regulation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Strahl and Hamoen, 2010</a>). However there is, to our knowledge, no report of a protein localization that would be specifically controlled by the other component of the <i>pmf</i>, the proton concentration gradient (\u0394pH). To evaluate the participation of the <i>pmf</i> in the subcellular localization of the GFP-labeled nitrate reductase and analyze the contribution of its two components, we first treated nitrate-respiring cells with distinct ionophores. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, the addition of carbonyl cyanide <i>m</i>-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a specific proton-ionophore rapidly dissipating the <i>pmf</i>, resulted in a significant reduction of cells displaying polar clusters. Unexpectedly, depolarization of the membrane potential through the addition of the potassium-ionophore valinomycin had no effect, whereas dissipation of \u0394pH by the electroneutral anion/OH<sup>\u2212</sup>-exchanger trichlorocarbanilide (TCC) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmed and Booth, 1983</a>) gave rise to significant delocalization of the fluorescent signal. To substantiate the critical role of \u0394pH for polar localization, we reasoned that artificial establishment of a proton concentration gradient by the light-driven proton translocation activity of the proteorhodopsin (PR) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Walter et al., 2007</a>) should be sufficient to promote the polar recruitment of the nitrate reductase complex under anoxic fermentative conditions. Indeed, under fermenting conditions, it is considered that the \u0394pH is very low as compared to respiring conditions. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, heterologous expression of PR resulted in polar localization of the fluorescence signal in nearly 40% of cells. Thus, we conclude that the proton concentration gradient is a critical cue for polar localization of this anaerobic OXPHOS complex. We next questioned the importance of nitrate reductase activity on its subcellular localization. To this end, a catalytically inactive but stable variant was used. In particular, the H50S substitution in NarG precludes insertion of two metal centers at the active site while x-ray structural analysis of the NarG<sub>H50S</sub>HI complex revealed the absence of structural changes at the protein surface (<a href=\"#bib21\">Magalon et al., 1998</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib28\">Rothery et al., 2010</a>). Under nitrate-respiring conditions, the fluorescence signal associated with the H50S variant is uniformly distributed likely due to its inability to generate a \u0394pH (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, adding fumarate gives rise to a significant polar localization of the inactive GFP-labeled nitrate reductase complex reinforcing the conclusion that activity of the complex is essential for polar positioning unless a \u0394pH is established (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, polar localization requires both the absence of oxygen and the establishment of a proton concentration gradient to which the nitrate reductase complex may contribute fuelling the localization mechanism."

The above-described modification of the localization pattern of the nitrate reductase complex in response to metabolic changes begs the question of its timeframe. First, nitrate-respiring cells were submitted to strong aeration and the fluorescent pattern was followed during the course of the anoxic\u2013oxic transition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). While 80% of the bacterial cells initially displayed a pronounced polar localization of the GFP-labeled nitrate reductase complex, the signal started to change noticeably after 15 min, reaching an almost uniform distribution after one hour of aerobic transition. A similar temporal behavior has been observed under the reverse conditions using aerobically growing cells transferred to anoxic conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In this case, more than 70% of the bacterial cells displayed a polar localization of the fluorescent signal after the transition. Thus, redistribution of the OXPHOS complex triggered by metabolic changes operates on timescales of several tens of minutes. While such timing may reflect the slow diffusion of such large membrane-embedded complexes in the crowded cytoplasmic membrane, we next questioned whether this switch is faster than the changes in nitrate reductase protein content as the result of transcriptional regulation. At first, western-blotting analyses showed nearly unchanged level of GFP-labeled nitrate reductase complex upon anoxic\u2013oxic transition despite the rapid redistribution of the complex in the cytoplasmic membrane (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In comparison, an increased level of complex is observed during the oxic\u2013anoxic transition as the result of FNR-mediated regulation. To substantiate these observations, localization upshift experiments were reproduced in cells pre-treated with chloramphenicol (Cm), a protein synthesis inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). During the anoxic\u2013oxic transition, Cm had nearly no impact on the delocalization kinetics with only slight diminution of the nitrate reductase content. Interestingly, during the oxic\u2013anoxic transition, the fluorescence signal remains uniformly distributed with a concomitant decrease of nitrate reductase content. To rule out any impact on the yielded <i>pmf</i> value under those conditions, the oxic\u2013anoxic upshift experiment was reproduced in presence of PR. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, establishment of a \u0394pH was not sufficient to promote polar localization. Altogether, these results support the idea that induction of the expression of at least one gene during the oxic\u2013anoxic transition promotes polar localization of the nitrate reductase complex."

To evaluate the impact of polar localization on the electron flux from primary dehydrogenases to GFP-labeled nitrate reductase, it was essential to ensure an identical composition of the cytoplasmic membrane in terms of OXPHOS complexes. To account for this issue, we used fermenting-growing cells expressing or not PR which have an identical OXPHOS proteome but display distinct localization patterns of the GFP-labeled complex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Upon addition of nitrate in the growth medium, electron flux through the nitrate reductase complex could be kinetically resolved by quantifying nitrite in the cell culture. As seen in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, within the first 10 min following nitrate addition, the rate of nitrite production is significantly higher in PR-expressing cells than in control cells, indicating a direct correlation between subcellular localization and electron flux through the nitrate reductase complex. After one hour, the level of nitrite produced is nearly two orders of magnitude higher in PR-expressing cells. We conclude that environmental conditions (anaerobiosis and a \u0394pH) promoting polar clustering of the nitrate reductase complex result in a higher efficiency of the associated respiratory chains."

                        "text": "In the past decade, the emerging field of bacterial cell biology has underscored the fact that dynamic subcellular localization is intimately linked to the biological function allowing control of fundamental processes, such as cell division, virulence, motility, or signal transduction (for reviews, see <a href=\"#bib13\">Kiekebusch and Thanbichler, 2014</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib15\">Laloux and Jacobs-Wagner, 2014</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib23\">Nevo-Dinur et al., 2012</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib30\">Shapiro et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, we have shown that the nitrate reductase respiratory complex is submitted to a spatiotemporal regulation in response to environmental conditions which, in turns, potentiates the electron flux through the associated respiratory chain. Nitrate respiration in <i>E. coli</i> is thus controlled by specific subcellular localization of its terminal reductase. Segregation of respiratory complexes within the cytoplasmic membrane has also been reported for components of bacterial aerobic chains (<a href=\"#bib11\">Johnson et al., 2004</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib18\">Lenn et al., 2008</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib36\">Werner et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Rexroth et al., 2011</a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib19\">Llorente-Garcia et al., 2014</a>). The actual view is that functional consequences are associated with a high level of structural organization of respiratory complexes within bioenergetic membranes (for a review, see <a href=\"#bib7\">Genova and Lenaz, 2014</a>). Interestingly enough, recent studies have evidenced the existence of functional microdomains in bacterial membranes organizing a specific subset of proteins in space and time surmising a gain-of-function (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lopez and Kolter, 2010</a>). In the same line of thought, it has recently been shown that clustering of multiple enzymes belonging to the same metabolic pathway into agglomerates accelerates the processing of intermediates (<a href=\"#bib5\">Castellana et al., 2014</a>). Clearly, several alternatives can be found for the reported enhanced electron flux in the nitrate reductase-associated respiratory chains such as physical association into supercomplexes or segregating respiratory complexes into microdomains. In both cases, one would hypothesize that the probability of the quinone molecules to encounter the nitrate reductase is higher. Evidences have been provided for such quinone channeling within supercomplexes while the exact mechanism of channeling is not yet understood (for a review, see <a href=\"#bib7\">Genova and Lenaz, 2014</a>)."

As the result of chromosomal expression, a low level of the NarGHI complex is observed in membrane vesicles of the LCB3635 strain grown under oxygen-respiring condition. This situation precludes accurate assessment of the quinol:nitrate oxidoreductase activity measured at 260 nm. Therefore, the JCB4023 strain was transformed with pVA70GFP, resulting in higher production of GFP-tagged NarGHI (eightfold as estimated by immunoblotting, data not shown) and allowing quinol activity measurements. The metabolism-dependent localization of the nitrate reductase was unaffected by the increased level of GFP-tagged NarGHI complex in the cells (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The NarGHI protein concentration was estimated using rocket immunoelectrophoresis as described in <a href=\"#bib16\">Lanciano et al. (2007)</a>. Western-blots were performed using antibodies raised against eGFP and IscS on samples run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Quantitative analysis of the fold change in GFP-labeled nitrate reductase protein levels was achieved by integration of the eGFP chemiluminescence signal normalized with the IscS one using samples containing an equal cell mass."

In case of anaerobically growing cells, images were taken after a 5\u201310 min delay shown to be optimal for activation of the GFP moiety during the mounting process. Furthermore using this procedure, we have noticed that the localization pattern was unchanged after 1 hr under the agar pad. The slide was analyzed by microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse TiE PFS inverted epifluorescence microscope (100 \u00d7 oil objective NA 1.3 Phase Contrast) and a Hamamatsu OrcaR2 CCD camera. Images were collected with NIS elements software. Observation of the fluorescence signal of GFP-labeled nitrate reductase under aerobic conditions was performed on cells grown in minimal medium with glycerol as sole carbon source and with nitrate for NarL-mediated <i>nar</i> operon expression. Under this condition, oxygen is preferred to nitrate as terminal electron acceptor (<a href=\"#bib33\">Unden et al, 2014</a>)."

To build an artificial proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane, PR was expressed in LCB3635 cells using the pPR plasmid (<a href=\"#bib32\">Tipping et al., 2013</a>). Cells transformed with the pBAD24 plasmid were used as control. Transformants were grown under aerobic conditions in a minimal medium supplemented with glucose and ampicillin. At early log phase, PR expression was induced with 0.02% arabinose together with <i>all-trans</i>-retinal (10 \u00b5M). At an OD600 of 1, the culture was shifted to anaerobic conditions and exposed to light for one hour, allowing the establishment of a proton gradient under these anoxic fermenting conditions. Fluorescence images were then taken as described above. Thanks to the red fluorescence emission of PR (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beja et al., 2000</a>), uniform distribution of the fluorescence signal is observed at the cell membrane using appropriate filter thus confirming its membrane localization (data not shown). Upon establishment of a polar localization of the GFP-tagged NarGHI complex in PR-expressing cells, nitrate was added at a final concentration of 100 mM and the rate of nitrite production was then determined spectrophotometrically by the Griess reaction as described above."

This plugin is called MicrobeJ and was created by A Ducret in Y Brun laboratory (<a href=\"http://www.indiana.edu/%7Emicrobej/index.html\">http://www.indiana.edu/\u223cmicrobej/index.html</a>) with Fiji software. Schematically, the clusters contrast was enhanced by a FFT band pass filter or by a morphological Top Hat filtering. The procedure includes automatic detection of cell shapes, medial axis determination, measurement of the cell size, and determination of the local fluorescence maxima (cluster detection) and of their absolute and relative position. The results of the image analysis were treated with R software (R Core Team [2014]. R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL <a href=\"http://www.R-project.org\">http://www.R-project.org</a>). An R script yields the number of cells containing at least one cluster with a relative position &lt; \u22120.6 or &gt; +0.6. These regions were defined as the cell poles (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The density map was calculated with the R ggplot2 package (H. Wickham. ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis. Springer New York, 2009). The ratio of cells with a least one polar cluster over the total number of cells shown in all the figures was calculated as the mean of at least three independent experiments. In each case, more than 500 cells were analyzed from three independent experiments. In drug treatment experiments, the effect was compared against paired control experiments. All statistical tests were performed by the no parametric Wilcoxon/Mann\u2013Whitney method when appropriate. Tests yielding a p value &gt;0.05 were assumed as non-significant difference. One star stands for a p value \u22640.05 and two stars stand for a p value \u22640.01."

There is no doubt that transcriptional up-regulation of <i>nar</i> gene expression occurs in a very rapid fashion (see for instance, Partridge et al. JBC 2006 and 2007), but how this is translated into changes in protein content considering the intricate structure of the complex of 500kDa with 8 metal centers was unclear. Additional data are now included in the revised manuscript as requested (see Results and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6CD</a>). During anoxic-oxic transition, the redistribution of the complex is unaffected by chloramphenicol and occurs within several tens of minutes without significant changes in nitrate reductase content (as evaluated by western-blotting). These data support the conclusion that changes in subcellular localization can occur without changes in complex content. In contrast, during the oxic-anoxic transition, FNR-mediated up regulation of the <i>nar</i> gene expression precludes any conclusion. Interestingly, these new data indicate that protein synthesis is required for polar localization under these oxic-anoxic conditions."

We provide here direct evidence that this is not the case in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>.
