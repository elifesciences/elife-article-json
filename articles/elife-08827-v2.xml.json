Cell migration is the directed movement of a single cell or a collective group of cells through the early embryo or the adult body. Many different cell types undergo chemotaxis-dependent directed migration during development, including primordial germ cells (PGCs), <i>Drosophila</i> border cells, the zebrafish posterior lateral line, <i>Drosophila</i> tracheal cells, vertebrate neural crest cells, and vertebrate anterior mesoderm (<a href=\"#bib26\">Reig et al., 2014</a>). The ability for cells to undergo directed migration towards a target location requires the use of different signal transduction mechanisms to remodel their actin cytoskeleton in a directed fashion such that they extend filopodia, lamellipodia, and blebs to create a polarized leading edge. In the sea urchin, a near complete developmental GRN describes the specification of endomesoderm (<a href=\"#bib18\">McClay, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Peter and Davidson, 2011</a>). Studies of this specification network have made the sea urchin a viable model for extending the study of how GRNs can explain control of complex cell behaviors (<a href=\"#bib34\">Saunders and McClay, 2014</a>). The migration of the sea urchin small micromeres serves as a powerful experimental model for connecting the genomic regulatory control of morphogenesis to an upstream GRN."

In Yajima et al., it was observed that during gut invagination, the small micromeres did not change position relative to the adjacent mesoderm cells of the advancing archenteron.

Seemingly contradictory evidence from Campanale et al. described an active migration throughout gastrulation and post-gastrulation as they make their way to the coelomic pouch (<a href=\"#bib2\">Campanale et al., 2014</a>). While both studies conclude that there is an active migration post-gastrulation, we clarified whether the small micromeres acquired their active movement before or after gastrulation. When removed from their endogenous location and placed ectopically, we find that the small micromeres are autonomous and active while migrating throughout gastrulation to make it \u2018home\u2019 to the coelomic pouch. Their active motility during gastrulation is essential for the ectopic small micromeres to undergo directed \u2018homing\u2019 migration to the coelomic pouch."

We find that a specific subcircuit composed of Pax6, Six3, Six1/2, Eya, and Dach1 that is canonically found in retinal development has been deployed for this distinct developmental process. Here, we describe a GRN for homing behavior and uncover a striking similarity of our morphogenesis GRN to the retinal determination gene network (RDGN)."

Host embryos were labeled by injection of histone2B-RFP mRNA and micromere-donor embryos with a membrane-GFP mRNA. At the 16-cell stage, one donor fluorescent micromere was transplanted to the vegetal pole where it replaced a surgically removed micromere (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Each fourth cleavage micromere gives rise to two lineages: the small micromere (the proposed primordial germ cell) and the large micromere (the skeletogenic mesoderm). The transplant surgery was performed at the 16-cell stage to ensure the survival of the small micromere daughters for two reasons. First, it assured that the small micromeres (which arise at fifth cleavage by an asymmetric division of the micromere) were not damaged by separation from the large micromeres during micromanipulation since they had not yet been born. Second, when the small micromeres appeared, their only initial connection to the embryo was via the spindle remnant to the large micromere\u2014this attachment to the large micromere was crucial for the incorporation of the transplant into the host embryo. Both reasons for surgically transplanting the micromere ensured the re-establishment and survival of a high percentage of small micromeres in the host embryo (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> shows scoring of transplant efficacy). At the beginning of gastrulation, this recombinant approach resulted in 8 fluorescent large micromere progeny and 2 fluorescent small micromeres (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). It was easy to distinguish the donor small micromere progeny from the large micromere progeny when the large micromeres fused with non-fluorescent host mesoderm cells to form the skeletal syncytium thereby greatly diluting their fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)."

Through those gaps, the small micromeres delaminated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), moved to the blastocoelar side of the remodeling basal lamina, and then actively migrated to the posterior end of the left or right coelomic pouch where they were then re-enveloped with a basal lamina layer by 2 dpf (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The migratory behavior of the small micromeres suggested that they underwent an EMT at the beginning of their migratory phase over the archenteron and to their coelomic pouch. These cells de-adhered, breached a basal lamina, changed shape, actively migrated within the blastocoel, and then rejoined an epithelium, demonstrating a number of EMT, and perhaps mesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition (MET), properties."

Since that movement is directed, in each case there must be a mechanism to provide guidance (<a href=\"#bib29\">Richardson and Lehmann, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yajima and Wessel, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Campanale et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Reig et al., 2014</a>). Knowing that the small micromeres were actively changing cell shape then moving to a new location at the end of gastrulation, we tested to see if small micromeres would undergo a directed migration to the coelomic pouch when placed in an ectopic location. Normally, small micromeres start their trajectory at the vegetal pole, which is the most posterior location in the embryo and terminate in the coelomic pouches near the anterior end of the embryo. Accordingly, small micromeres were placed ectopically at varying locations along the anterior/posterior axis of 16- to 60-cell staged embryos, and the frequency of their ability to find their way to the coelomic pouch at 2 days post fertilization (dpf) was scored (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Micromeres placed at the vegetal pole served as a control since that is their endogenous starting location. Donors placed in the endogenous location homed 86.6% (n = 213) of the time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). 13.4% of observed cases that were considered \u2018no homing\u2019 were instances where we could not find fluorescent small micromeres in the host embryo's coelomic pouch. Those that did not make it to the coelomic pouch became lost in the blastocoelar space, which we scored as \u2018no homing\u2019. Micromeres were then placed ectopically between the Veg1 and Veg2 tier and in the animal half between the An1 and An2 tier of presumptive ectodermal cells (scored together as equator), at the animal pole, or in the blastocoel. No matter where they were placed, the vast majority of small micromeres transplanted to ectopic positions anywhere in the embryo made it home (Equator = 93.7% (n = 74), Animal Pole = 78.6% (n = 11), Blastocoel = 78.6% (n = 11)) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>). Interestingly, the majority of transplants were scored to be in the left coelomic pouch after homing suggesting a survival mechanism to ensure the proposed primordial germ cells make it onto adulthood to contribute to the gamete pool."

Did they move from the ectopic position within the plane of the epithelium, or did they ingress from the ectopic location into the blastocoel and find the coelomic pouch from there? If they did ingress into the blastocoel, were they first attracted to the endogenous small micromeres before migrating to the coelomic pouch mesoderm, or did the small micromeres autonomously move to the coelomic pouches? Could it be that the ectopically placed small micromeres precociously ingressed through the basement membrane and thus headed directly to their final destination? To see when and where the ectopic small micromeres found their way home, we transplanted differentially labeled micromeres to two different locations (one at the animal pole [<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>] and one at the equator [<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>]) to host embryos.

Because the ectopic small micromeres ingressed at the time of skeletogenic cell ingression, we wondered whether isolated small micromeres could ingress on their own. By ectopically transplanting just 32-cell stage small micromeres (as opposed to the usual 16-cell stage micromere, which would result in large and small micromere cells) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), we observed the small micromeres autonomously invade through the laminin layer independent of large micromeres.

The question was whether the small micromeres home directly to the coelomic pouch region or indirectly. First, to ask if the mesoderm is the lineage to which the small micromeres home, we knocked out Delta, a signal necessary for mesodermal specification (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sherwood and McClay, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sweet et al., 2002</a>). The lack of mesoderm, indeed, had an effect on homing. In the experiment, Delta was knocked down in host embryos and control (unperturbed) micromeres were placed ectopically at the equator of those embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The small micromeres did not home to any significant location in the embryo (coelomic pouches were non-existent in the KD) and became lost in the blastocoelar space as is seen in cases we deemed \u2018no homing\u2019 65% of the time (n = 23, p &lt; 0.0001) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). 35% of the time, there was an incomplete knockdown of the Delta signal resulting in a coelomic pouch and the small micromeres homed to that location.

It becomes spatially restricted around mesenchyme blastula to the coelomic pouch mesoderm (A3). During gastrulation, it is found throughout and at the tip of the archenteron in the presumptive coelomic pouch cells (A5-8) and is maintained in that tissue and gut throughout coelomic pouch coalescence with the small micromeres at the pluteus stage (A7-8). <i>six3's</i> earliest detectable expression is at early blastula (B1). It is found in the animal pole region, and expression in the coelomic pouch mesoderm begins around mesenchyme blastula (B3). Throughout gastrulation, <i>six3</i> is found in the apical plate domain and the future coelomic pouch cells (B3-4). As was seen in Wei 2009, the <i>six3</i> apical domain of expression is responsible for giving rise to neural fates. Post-gastrulation, <i>six3</i> is expressed in both coelomic pouches (B8). <i>Six1/2</i> is seen to be expressed in the NSM beginning at mesenchyme blastula (C3). It maintains expression in the NSM throughout early development and is in the coelomic pouches by early pluteus (C7). Genes activated at mid-gastrula stage at the tip of the archenteron and endure throughout gastrulation include <i>foxc</i> and <i>eya</i>. mRNA expression is detected in the coelomic pouch mesoderm at the tip of the archenteron and end up in the coelomic pouches. <i>eya</i> begins expression at mid-gastrula in the aboral coelomic pouch at the tip of the archenteron (D4). <i>eya</i> expression by 32 hpf is found in the left coelomic pouch (D8). <i>pax6</i> expression begins at mid to late gastrula stage in the aboral coelomic pouch at the tip of the archenteron, roughly at the time of ectopic small micromere homing (E5), and by 32 hpf is found in the left coelomic pouch and two lateral patches of ectoderm presumed to be neural in fate (E8)."

By surveying this gene set, we conclude that their co-localization in the coelomic pouches and temporal expression patterns suggest that these transcription factors may be interacting (diagram, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). To ask how or if these genes interact in a gene network to drive the morphogenetic cassette, we undertook a perturbation analysis to build a homing GRN upstream of the morphogenetic movement."

Knowing that <i>dach1</i> is expressed in the endoderm earlier in development from our time course data, we concluded that the upregulation seen in the gut was a result of <i>dach1</i> self-repression not only in the gut but also later in the coelomic pouch mesoderm expression. A down-regulation of <i>six3</i> and a down-regulation of <i>eya</i> transcripts was also seen in the Dach1 perturbation. These data indicate that Dach1 positively regulates <i>six3</i> and <i>eya</i> and inhibits the overexpression of itself by repression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

Ancient subcircuit functions necessary for systems-level operations in networks may be employed as a unit as new networks evolve rather than build new systems level operations gene by gene. It isn't yet known whether evolution favors subcircuits of similar topology moving as a unit to perform similar functions in diverse cell types, but advances in systems-level studies should reveal the frequency of this phenomenon."

When they arrive at the tip of the archenteron, they then leave the epithelium using an EMT through a laminin-containing basement membrane, migrate to the posterior end of the coelomic pouch, and transition back to an epithelium as they coalesce with the coelomic pouch. Ectopically placed small micromeres behave differently from the endogenous small micromeres in that they fail to retain epithelial adhesions through gastrulation and instead go through an EMT at the time PMCs ingress. The fact that the ectopically placed small micromeres lose adhesion and go through EMT independent of the timing of archenteron tip formation implies that there must be a non-autonomous cue to keep the endogenous small micromeres in place during gastrulation. Without that local cue, the small micromeres actively home from the beginning of gastrulation as seen with the behavior of ectopically placed small micromeres. Further, there must be a non-autonomous signal that is recognized by small micromeres when they reach the tip of the forming archenteron that cues them to initiate the EMT and migration. The behavior of the ectopic cells suggest that the migratory capacity can be activated at the beginning of gastrulation, but since they normally do not move from the epithelium until at the tip of the archenteron, another event may stimulate them to complete their journey to the coelomic pouches."

The cells find their way to the coelomic pouch no matter their starting location. In other systems cells become polarized in response to a chemoattractant signal at the leading edge of the cell while the remainder of the cell is cued to receive inhibitory or repulsion signals responsible for increasing its sensitivity to its target location (as reviewed by <a href=\"#bib29\">Richardson and Lehmann, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Reig et al., 2014</a>). Small micromeres appear to take a fairly direct route to their eventual target no matter where they are initially placed. Since the normal route involves movement through part of the blastocoel, and since ectopic small micromeres also use the blastocoelar route, the putative homing signal likely is produced earlier than the end of gastrulation since the ectopic small micromeres move through the blastocoel to the correct target well before gastrulation is completed."

If it were chemoattraction, the cue must work at the individual cell level since single small micromeres respond to the cue when ectopically placed. The transcriptional regulation upstream of that putative signal offers approaches for its identification. Potentially, as an alternative hypothesis, the coelomic pouch NSM could be drawing the small micromeres to their final site by filopodia, since it is known that these cells as well as the small micromeres extend filopodia (<a href=\"#bib4\">Hardin, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Campanale et al., 2014</a>).

In addition, other subcircuits are necessary to drive the EMT, for reception of the putative signal, and for directed movement in response. Transcriptional control of directed cell migration is not well studied at a systems level. There are a few examples, however, that suggest the way these systems work. Findings in the tunicate, <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>, describe the distinct transcriptional regulation of a cellular module that drives migration of heart precursors. The heart GRN drives membrane protrusions and RhoGTPase signaling, tail retraction, adhesion, and polarity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Christiaen et al., 2008</a>). One important feature of that study was that the cells constitutively expressed many of the factors required for these cell behaviors. It only took one or two factors to be under direct control of the developmental GRN to regulate the timing, directionality, onset, and termination of the heart cell precursors' journey. In the sea urchin, five different GRN subcircuits were shown to drive five different cellular components of an EMT (<a href=\"#bib34\">Saunders and McClay, 2014</a>). It is highly likely, like <i>Ciona</i> heart cells, that the sea urchin developmental GRN will control directly expression of only a fraction of the proteins used for de-adhesion, motility, invasion of the basement membrane, altered cell polarity, and cell shape changes, all components of an EMT, while many other proteins in those processes will be constitutively expressed. Using small micromere homing as an assay, we were able to begin to unravel the intricacy of GRN subcircuits that control cell migration to a target site. This work thus demonstrates how morphogenesis can be controlled by conserved specification GRN subcircuits."

We tend to think of the result of the movement: the small micromeres become associated with the aboral coelomic pouch through homing. Yet, to accomplish that feat, both the cells that home and the target cells must enact a series of coordinated, but independent processes. Here, we found a set of genes that control the production of the putative homing signal. Being that the subcircuit is of coherent feed-forward topology, we suspect it will be found at the most distal part of a larger GRN; therefore, it will act downstream of the specification circuitry of the signal-producing cell type. Connecting that upstream subcircuit to the downstream signal(s) will provide a tool for explaining one component of the homing mechanism that we know to be transcriptionally controlled."

Evolving as a modular unit must mean that the subcircuit serves as an indispensible or important component in a network full of modular components. The assembly of the coherent feed-forward circuit, once established, appears to remain intact in separate lineages for the same reason: that circuit must be critical for the GRNs in which it is embedded. Its presence raises the question of whether there are other ancient or more recent subcircuits that have evolved as modules. Since analysis of developmental GRNs is a relatively young field, it is possible that a number of ancient modular subcircuits evolve as units to assist in the diversification of cell types and morphogenesis. One obvious outcome of this mode of inheritance would be a contribution to robustness in developmental mechanisms. And perhaps once a subcircuit is particularly well integrated and suited for a given type of regulatory function, each of its members (in our case, transcription factors) might act as a constraint on the others because any reduction in integration would be less adaptive."

Hybridization took place at 60\u201365\u00b0C. Probes were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (1:1500, Roche [Indianapolis, IN, United States]). Finally, color was developed using NBT/BCIP (Roche). For double fluorescent in situ hybridization, a second probe (labeled with Fluorescein-12-UTP) was hybridized. Expression was visualized using the Tyramide Signal Amplification system (TSA-plus kit, Perkin Elmer [Waltham, MA, United States]). Embryos were visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan2 upright microscope."

The authors use elegant microsurgical approaches to demonstrate this homing behavior and to show its dependence on various transcription factors expressed in the coelomic pouches. Based on these genes and the regulatory interactions among them, the authors show that a genetic circuit previously associated mostly with retinal determination in <i>Drosophila</i> also functions in the coelomic pouches to direct the migration of sea urchin small micromeres.

(Development 136, p1179, 2009). Wei et al. clearly showed that the <i>six3</i> gene identified from the California purple sea urchin is first expressed in the animal pole domain at the early blastula stage. The expression in the animal pole can be observed throughout gastrulation in addition to a second expression domain \u201cin some secondary mesenchyme cells scattered throughout the blastocoel and at the tip of the archenteron.\u201d In the subsection \u201cPerturbation analysis unveils a GRN circuit that controls homing\u201d, the authors mentioned \u201c<i>six3</i> was found to be expressed in the aboral mesoderm\u201d, and cited <a href=\"#bib43\">Wei et al., 2011</a>. However, whether <i>six3</i> is expressed in the oral or aboral coelomic pouches or even in the small micromeres requires double staining of <i>six3</i> with appropriate markers. Where <i>six3</i> is expressed is important for interpretation of the data. In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, it is intriguing that knockdown of <i>six3</i> in both micromeres and the host affected homing. Therefore, it is possible that <i>six3</i> is expressed in both small micromeres and the coelomic pouch mesodermal cells. One additional issue is that Luo and Su (PLoS Biology, 2012) showed that in addition to the three factors studied by the authors (<i>dach1</i>, <i>eya</i> and <i>pax6</i>), <i>six1/2</i> is also expressed in the aboral coelomic pouch.

From this data, we hypothesized that the likely mechanism is chemotaxis.

We found that after increasing the number of scored cases, the effect of Six3 when knocked down in just the small micromere was statistically insignificant.
