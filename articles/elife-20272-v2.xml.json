                    "text": "About 300 loss-of-function mutations in the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel have been identified in patients with Long QT syndrome and cardiac arrhythmia. How specific mutations cause arrhythmia is largely unknown and there are no approved I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators for treatment of these arrhythmias. We find that several Long QT syndrome-associated I<sub>Ks</sub> channel mutations shift channel voltage dependence and accelerate channel closing. Voltage-clamp fluorometry experiments and kinetic modeling suggest that similar mutation-induced alterations in I<sub>Ks</sub> channel currents may be caused by different molecular mechanisms. Finally, we find that the fatty acid analogue N-arachidonoyl taurine restores channel gating of many different mutant channels, even though the mutations are in different domains of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel and affect the channel by different molecular mechanisms. N-arachidonoyl taurine is therefore an interesting prototype compound that may inspire development of future I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators to treat Long QT syndrome caused by diverse I<sub>Ks</sub> channel mutations."

How specific mutations cause arrhythmia is largely unknown and there are no approved I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators for treatment of these arrhythmias. We find that several Long QT syndrome-associated I<sub>Ks</sub> channel mutations shift channel voltage dependence and accelerate channel closing. Voltage-clamp fluorometry experiments and kinetic modeling suggest that similar mutation-induced alterations in I<sub>Ks</sub> channel currents may be caused by different molecular mechanisms. Finally, we find that the fatty acid analogue N-arachidonoyl taurine restores channel gating of many different mutant channels, even though the mutations are in different domains of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel and affect the channel by different molecular mechanisms. N-arachidonoyl taurine is therefore an interesting prototype compound that may inspire development of future I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators to treat Long QT syndrome caused by diverse I<sub>Ks</sub> channel mutations."

This wave must reach different parts of the heart in a specific sequence to ensure that the heart muscle cells contract in a coordinated manner. Such coordinated contractions enable the heart to pump enough blood around the body. By allowing specific ions to flow into or out of the heart muscle cell, proteins called ion channels in the cell membrane generate the electric wave, keep it going and stop it.

In LQTS, the action potential of the heart is prolonged, which is observed as a prolonged QT interval in the electrocardiogram. LQTS patients have an increased risk of developing ventricular tachyarrhythmias called <i>torsades de pointes</i> when exposed to triggers such as adrenergic stress (<a href=\"#bib27\">Morita et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cerrone et al., 2012</a>). These arrhythmias can cause palpitation, syncope or sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation. To improve the clinical outcome of LQTS patients, it is therefore critical to prevent these LQTS-induced life-threatening arrhythmias."

The I<sub>Ks</sub> channel provides one of the important delayed rectifier outward potassium currents that repolarizes the cardiomyocyte and terminates the cardiac action potential (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nerbonne and Kass, 2005</a>). Reduced I<sub>Ks</sub> function therefore tends to delay cardiomyocyte repolarization, thereby causing prolonged cardiac action potential durations and a prolonged QT interval. The cardiac I<sub>Ks</sub> channel consists of four K<sub>V</sub>7.1 subunits and two to four KCNE1 subunits (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nakajo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Plant et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Murray et al., 2016</a>). Throughout this work, we will refer to the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel as K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1. K<sub>V</sub>7.1 has six transmembrane segments named S1-S6 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liin et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). S1-S4 of each K<sub>V</sub>7.1 subunit forms a voltage-sensing domain where S4 is the voltage sensor with three positive gating charges. S5 and S6 from all four K<sub>V</sub>7.1 subunits form the pore domain with a putative gate in S6 that needs to move to open the ion-conducting pore of the channel. KCNE1 has a single-transmembrane segment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>) and is proposed to be localized in the otherwise lipid-filled space between two voltage-sensing domains of neighbouring K<sub>V</sub>7.1 subunits (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nakajo and Kubo, 2015</a>). Upon cardiomyocyte depolarization, the voltage sensor of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 moves outward in relation to the membrane. It has been proposed that this movement of the voltage sensor is transferred to the pore domain via the S4-S5 linker and induces channel opening by moving the S6 gate (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liin et al., 2015</a>)."

LQTS is today treated with drugs that prevent the triggering of arrhythmic activity, such as beta-blockers, or with arrhythmia-terminating implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hedley et al., 2009</a>).

As L251P and F351S did not produce functional channels (<a href=\"#bib31\">Napolitano et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Deschenes et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we engineered the milder L251A and F351A mutants instead. L251A and F351A will be referred to as 'LQTS-like mutants'. When expressed alone in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes, all investigated K<sub>V</sub>7.1 mutants, except F193L and V215M, display a shifted conductance <i>versus</i> voltage curve (<i>G</i>(<i>V</i>)) compared to the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). S225L, L251A and F351A shift the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) towards positive voltages compared to wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1. In contrast, R583C shifts the half-maximal activation, <i>V</i><sub>50</sub>,\u00a0~10 mV towards negative voltages compared to wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1. This apparent negative shift is likely caused by the pronounced inactivation of the R583C mutant (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>), which is seen to a\u00a0considerable smaller extent in the other K<sub>V</sub>7.1 mutants and wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1 (inset in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>). When a fraction of the\u00a0channels are released from inactivation, by introducing a brief hyperpolarizing pulse between the test pulse and the tail pulse, R583C has a <i>V</i><sub>50</sub> fairly comparable to wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3b</a>)."

K<sub>V</sub>7.1/F351A causes the most dramatic change by shifting V<sub>50</sub> more than\u00a0+30 mV. We are therefore only able to record the foot of the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curve of K<sub>V</sub>7.1/F351A+KCNE1, and a shift in V<sub>50</sub> of\u00a0+30 mV is a lower estimate of the change in V<sub>50</sub> (\u0394V<sub>50</sub>). One of the other mutants with dramatically shifted <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) is K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L+KCNE1. V<sub>50</sub> for K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L+KCNE1 is shifted almost\u00a0+30 mV compared to wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). S225L also slows down K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel opening kinetics (p&lt;0.01; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). All mutations, except for L251A, accelerate channel closing kinetics compared to wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). K70N has the most dramatic effect on K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel closing by accelerating the closing kinetics by approximately a factor of 5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). When comparing the amplitude of K<sup>+</sup> currents generated by these mutants with the current amplitude of the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel in the same batch of oocytes, we note that all mutants generate smaller currents than wild-type over a large voltage range (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Although defective trafficking may contribute to these reduced currents in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes, the current amplitudes for most mutants matches fairly well with the predicted current amplitude from channels with <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curves shifted towards positive voltages as observed for these mutants (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4a</a>), suggesting that the reduced current amplitudes in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes are mainly a result of gating defects (and not trafficking defects)."

To mimic heterozygous expression, we co-inject the mutated K<sub>V</sub>7.1 subunit and KCNE1 subunit together with the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1 subunit (or wild-type KCNE1 subunit for KCNE1 mutants) (cartoon in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We refer to this as heterozygous expression. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a\u2013b</a> compares the\u00a0homozygous expression (K<sub>V</sub>7.1<sup>wt</sup>+KCNE1<sup>mut</sup> or K<sub>V</sub>7.1<sup>mut</sup>+KCNE1<sup>wt</sup>) with heterozygous expression (K<sub>V</sub>7.1<sup>wt</sup>+K<sub>V</sub>7.1<sup>mut</sup>+KCNE1<sup>wt</sup> or K<sub>V</sub>7.1<sup>wt</sup>+KCNE1<sup>wt</sup>+KCNE1<sup>mut</sup>) for K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) and KCNE1/K70N (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). Both of these examples show that heterozygous expression generates channels with more wild-type like opening or closing kinetics and <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) compared to homozygous expression of the mutant subunit. A milder biophysical phenotype upon heterozygous expression is generally seen for the LQTS and LQTS-like mutants in terms of <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>), current amplitude, and/or closing kinetics (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c\u2013d</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). This milder phenotype indicates that the wild-type subunit can partly restore K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 function. Alternatively, for mutants with a <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) that is very shifted to positive voltages (e.g. F351A), it may be that channel complexes that contain the mutated subunits are largely out of the physiological voltage range and therefore do not contribute substantially to the recorded current. Also, for mutants with low membrane expression (e.g. possibly F193L [<a href=\"#bib55\">Yamaguchi et al., 2003</a>]), it may be that channels containing the wild-type subunit are favoured so that in most K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel complexes the majority (or all) of the subunits will be wild-type subunits."

                                "text": "Although most of the mutations shift channel voltage dependence and affect channel closing kinetics, the underlying mechanism of mutation-induced changes in K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel function is most likely different for different mutations. For instance, mutations located in S5 and S6 (e.g. F351A) may mainly affect gate movement, while mutations in S1\u2013S4 (e.g. S225L) are more likely to affect voltage sensor movement. To explore whether different mutations interfere with different gating transitions, we use voltage clamp fluorometry, in which the movement of the voltage sensor in K<sub>V</sub>7.1 can be tracked by the fluorescence change from the fluorescent probe Alexa-488-maleimide attached to G219C in the S3-S4 loop (referred to as G219C*) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Osteen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Osteen et al., 2012</a>). Voltage sensor movement (measured by fluorescence) and gate movement (measured by ionic currents) are then monitored under two-electrode voltage clamp. The K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C* construct by itself or co-expressed with KCNE1 gives voltage-dependent fluorescence changes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). As previously reported, the fluorescence <i>versus</i> voltage (<i>F</i>(<i>V</i>)) curve of K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C* correlates well with the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curve (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, left panel), while the <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) curve of K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*+KCNE1 is divided into two components (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, right panel) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Osteen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Osteen et al., 2012</a>). For K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*+KCNE1, the first fluorescence component (<i>F</i>1) has been suggested to represent the main voltage sensor movement and the second fluorescence component (<i>F</i>2) to be correlated with gate opening (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</a>). We introduce G219C into K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L and K<sub>V</sub>7.1/F351A. The <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curves of both K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/S225L and K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/F351A are shifted towards more positive voltages compared to the wild-type channel, but the <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) curves are differentially affected by the two mutations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b\u2013c</a>, left panels). For K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/S225L, the <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) curve is shifted to a similar extent as the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curve, while for K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/F351A, the <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) curve is shifted to a considerably smaller extent (<a href=\"#bib35\">Osteen et al., 2010</a>). When these mutants are co-expressed with KCNE1, we observe different effects on the voltage dependence of the two fluorescent components <i>F</i>1 and <i>F</i>2 induced by the mutations. The S225L mutation primarily shifts <i>F</i>1 towards positive voltages so that <i>F</i>1 and <i>F</i>2 of K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/S225L+KCNE1 are hardly distinguishable in the <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) curve (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, right panel). In contrast, the F351A mutation primarily shifts <i>F</i>2 towards positive voltages so that <i>F</i>1 and <i>F</i>2 are clearly separated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, right panel). Thus, S225L and F351A seem to shift the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curve of K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 towards positive voltages by interfering with different gating transitions."

One note of caution is that the interpretation of the mutational effects is dependent on the models used for the wild-type channels. Other models for K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels have been proposed (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zaydman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ruscic et al., 2013</a>), but these have not been as extensively tested or developed as our models. Although other alternative mechanisms for the effects of these mutations are possible, the different impacts of S225L and F351A on the fluorescence versus voltage relationships suggest that these mutations introduce distinct molecular defects."

In contrast, we found that the PUFA analogue N-arachidonoyl taurine (N-AT, structure in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) retained its ability to activate the K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel also in the presence of KCNE1. N-AT activated the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 by shifting the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) roughly \u201330 mV (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liin et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The magnitude of this N-AT-induced shift is comparable to, but in the\u00a0opposite direction, to the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) shifts observed for several of the LQTS and LQTS-like mutants. We therefore here test the ability of N-AT to enhance the function of the eight K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 mutant channels. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013b</a> shows representative effects of 7\u201370 \u00b5M N-AT on K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L+KCNE1. 70 \u00b5M N-AT increases current amplitude by a factor of 16 at\u00a0+20 mV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>) and shifts the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curve by about \u201350 mV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Steady state of N-AT effects is reached within a few minutes (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We note a small instantaneous \u2018leak\u2019 component in the 70 \u00b5M N-AT trace of K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L+KCNE1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). This leak component in K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L+KCNE1 is observed also in the absence of N-AT, but at more positive voltages (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We do not observe this leak component in wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 upon application of N-AT (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>), which suggests that this phenomenon is associated with the S225L mutation. The human ventricular action potential has a\u00a0duration of about 300\u2013400 ms and a systolic voltage range of about 0 to\u00a0+40 mV (<a href=\"#bib33\">O'Hara et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Piacentino et al., 2003</a>). To test the behaviour of the S225L mutation during shorter stimulating pulses, we apply repetitive 300 ms pulses to\u00a0+40 mV at a frequency of 1 Hz and at 28\u00b0C (37\u00b0C was not tolerated by the oocytes). In response to this protocol, the K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L+KCNE1 channel barely opens and thus generates only minor currents (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). In contrast, we observe large K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L+KCNE1 currents upon application of 70 \u00b5M N-AT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). N-AT also restores the gradual increase in current amplitude during repetitive pulsing seen experimentally (inset in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>) and in computer simulations (<a href=\"#bib50\">Silva and Rudy, 2005</a>) for the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel."

                                "text": "Further testing of N-AT show that 70 \u00b5M N-AT shifts the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curve of all tested mutants by 30\u201350 mV towards more negative voltages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d\u2013e</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). The <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curve of wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 is shifted by \u201327.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5 mV (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liin et al., 2015</a>). Thus, 70 \u00b5M N-AT completely corrects the positive <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) shifts induced by the mutations so that in the presence of N-AT the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) is similar to or shifted negative compared to the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) of the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>, F351A homozygous expression was not included in this analysis because of the very shifted <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curve of this mutant). The <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) of mutants is shifted about equally by N-AT for homozygous and heterozygous expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e</a>). The slope of the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curve varies slightly (10.4 to 16.3) among the mutants (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). To correct for this difference in slope and to better compare the functional effect of N-AT-induced <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) shifts on the different mutants, we also calculate the change in Gibbs free energy for channel opening (\u0394\u0394Go) that 70 \u00b5M N-AT induces. 70 \u00b5M N-AT reduces the energy required to open the channel by 5.3\u20139.0 kJ/mol depending on mutant (4.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 kJ/mol (n\u00a0=\u00a05) for wild-type) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f</a>). To estimate the functional effect of N-AT on the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 current amplitude of each mutant, we calculate the ratio of the current amplitude at the end of the 5 s test pulse before and after application of N-AT at\u00a0+20 and +40 mV. The 5 s voltage pulse to\u00a0+20 mV (or\u00a0+\u00a040 mV) at room temperature was chosen to make the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel activate to a similar extent as during a ventricular action potential (300\u2013400 ms) at body temperature (note that K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels have a relatively high Q<sub>10</sub> of around 5\u20137.5 [<a href=\"#bib6\">Busch and Lang, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Seebohm et al., 2001</a>]). 70 \u00b5M N-AT increases the current amplitude of all mutants at these voltages (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4a\u2013b</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). As expected, current amplitude is most increased for those mutants that have the most shifted <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curve towards more positive voltages (e.g. V215M and S225L). This is because these mutants are still at the foot of their <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curve at\u00a0+20 and +40 mV and a N-AT-induced shift towards more negative voltages results in a relatively larger increase in the current amplitude. By multiplying these relative N-AT-induced increases in current amplitude with the relative current amplitude of each mutant (compared to wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels, from <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4c\u2013d</a>), we observe that 70 \u00b5M N-AT compensates fairly well (or overcompensates) for the mutation-induced reduction in current amplitude (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4c</a>). Moreover, for all mutant and wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels, 70 \u00b5M N-AT speeds up the opening kinetics at\u00a0+40 mV by a factor of 1.3\u20132.5 (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). 70 \u00b5M N-AT also slows down the closing kinetics for most mutants and wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). For F351A heterozygous expression and R583C homozygous expression, 70 \u00b5M N-AT restores the closing kinetics so that the closing kinetics is not statistically different (p&gt;0.05) from wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 closing kinetics (737\u00a0\u00b1\u00a062 ms and 833\u00a0\u00b1\u00a074 ms, respectively compared to 967\u00a0\u00b1\u00a047 ms for wild-type). In the presence of KCNE1, channels made with F193L heterozygous expression, L251A homozygous expression, and R583C heterozygous expression have wild-type like closing kinetics already before application of N-AT."

Surprisingly, N-AT caused a dramatic decrease in the fluorescence from Alexa488-labeled K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*+KCNE1 channels (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>).

The mechanism of the N-AT-induced decrease of fluorescence from Alexa488-labeled K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*+KCNE1 channels is not clear, but could be due to N-AT inducing a conformational change in KCNE1 or K<sub>V</sub>7.1 that brings a quenching residue close to Alexa488."

With this normalization, voltage clamp fluorometry experiments on K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/S225L+KCNE1 indicate that N-AT shifts both the voltage dependence of the first part (which represents <i>F</i>1) and the second part (which represents <i>F</i>2) of the <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) curve towards more negative voltages (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). However, due to the not completely saturating <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) for K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/F351A+KCNE1, we are unable to reliably normalize the <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) curves in the presence of N-AT to the control <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) curves. We instead explore the effect of N-AT on the kinetics of the two fluorescence components: <i>F</i>1, which is seen as a fast fluorescence change at negative voltages, and <i>F</i>2, which is seen as a slow fluorescence change on top of the <i>F</i>1 component at positive voltages (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</a>). <i>F</i>1 correlates with the measured gating currents in K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels (and the initial delay in the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 ionic currents), whereas <i>F</i>2 correlates with the opening of K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</a>). For both mutants, 70 \u00b5M N-AT speeds up <i>F</i>1 kinetics (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a,d</a>, measured at \u201340 mV where virtually no channels open and the fluorescence is mainly composed of <i>F</i>1). Numeric values for N-AT effects on channel kinetics are summarized in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a>. Moreover, N-AT accelerates the channel opening kinetics (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b,e</a>) and both the <i>F</i>1 and <i>F</i>2 fluorescence components at\u00a0+80 mV for K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/S225L+KCNE1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a>). The change in the <i>F</i>2 component is probably larger than what the fits of a double-exponential function suggest, because the slow part of the fluorescence, mainly <i>F</i>2, overlay nicely on the currents in both the presence and absence of 70 \u00b5M N-AT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>, upper panel). As a control, we show that the fluorescence in N-AT does not, however, overlay the currents in control solutions and vice versa (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>, middle and lower panel). For K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/F351A+KCNE1, the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curve and the <i>F</i>2 component are so shifted towards depolarizing voltages that we cannot reliably quantify the <i>F</i>2 component in our fluorescence traces. 70 \u00b5M N-AT does, however, speed up K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/F351A+KCNE1 current kinetics (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>), which suggests that N-AT also speeds up <i>F</i>2 in K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/F351A+KCNE1. Altogether, these results suggest that N-AT accelerates both conformational changes during the main gating charge movement and channel opening."

This suggests that at least part of the mechanism underlying the reduced ability of these mutants to generate K<sup>+</sup> currents is by altering these biophysical properties of the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel. Using voltage clamp fluorometry in combination with kinetic modeling, we further suggest that these altered biophysical properties in mutants may be caused by interference with different gating transitions. Our experimental data and kinetic modeling are consistent with a model in which K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L primarily causes the\u00a0reduced channel function by altering the main voltage sensor movement, while K<sub>V</sub>7.1/F351A alters later gating transitions associated with pore opening. The different effects of S225L and F351A on the fluorescence <i>versus</i> voltage relationships in K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C* and K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*+KCNE1 suggest that these mutations cause channel dysfunction via different molecular mechanisms. Note that we used the LQTS-like F351A mutant, because the LQTS mutant F351S did not generate any currents (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, during the review process of this manuscript a new LQTS mutation, F351L, was found (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vyas et al., 2016</a>). The current and fluorescence of this LQTS mutant is very similar to the current and fluorescence of F351A (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that our conclusions on the LQTS-like F351A is also relevant for the LQTS mutant F351L."

This mutant was previously reported to have reduced current amplitude compared to the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel and a mild clinical phenotype (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yamaguchi et al., 2003</a>). The F193L mutation may therefore cause loss of function by faster deactivation kinetics and lower current density. Heterozygous expression of mutated subunits and wild-type subunits in equal molar ratios results in general in a milder biophysical phenotype (more close to the wild-type phenotype). This is in line with a milder clinical phenotype generally reported for heterozygous carriers of LQTS mutations compared to individuals with homozygous genotypes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Priori et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jackson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, for different mutations different biophysical effects of the mutations could be dominant or recessive: For S225L and L251A, heterozygous expression in the presence of KCNE1 partially or completely restores wild-type like <i>V</i><sub>50</sub>, whereas heterozygous expression does not improve closing kinetics compared to homozygous expression. For KCNE1/K70N and KCNE1/S74L, co-expression with wild-type KCNE1 subunits also restores wild-type like <i>V</i><sub>50</sub>, whereas wild-type like closing kinetics is only partially restored. In contrast, for K<sub>V</sub>7.1/R583C, heterozygous expression restores wild-type like closing kinetics, but not wild-type like <i>V</i><sub>50</sub>. However, because of uncertainties regarding the stoichiometry of mutant to wild-type subunits in assembled K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels (as mentioned in the Results section), further studies will be required to understand the mechanisms underlying these apparent dominant or recessive effects and to evaluate possible physiological impact of these effects."

This is in contrast to previously reported K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activators on disease-causing K<sub>V</sub>7 mutants, for which mutants show markedly different sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib49\">Seebohm et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Xiong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Leitner et al., 2012</a>). 70 \u00b5M N-AT shifts the <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) curve of the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel and of all LQTS and LQTS-like mutants by approximately (\u201350)\u2013(\u201330) mV, accelerates channel opening and slows down channel closing. In the presence of 70 \u00b5M N-AT, the <i>V</i><sub>50</sub> of all LQTS and LQTS-like mutants are similar to or more negative than <i>V</i><sub>50</sub> for the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel. For most mutants, 70 \u00b5M N-AT overcompensates for the shift in <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) and reduction in current amplitude caused by the mutations, indicating that a lower N-AT concentration or a less potent N-AT analogue could be used to restore wild-type like <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) and current amplitudes. Moreover, K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 opening and closing kinetics are partially or completely restored by N-AT. Also, although the disease aetiology of the F193L mutant is likely mainly reduced channel expression, the N-AT induced augmentation caused by a shift in <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) and increased currents may at least in part overcome the reduction in currents caused by the reduced channel expression. This general ability of N-AT to, at least partly, compensate for the reduced function of mutants with\u00a0mutations\u00a0in different parts of the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel complex and with seemingly different molecular defects, as long as a population of these mutant channels reaches the plasma membrane, suggests that N-AT is an interesting model compound for development of future anti-arrhythmics to treat LQTS caused by diverse K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 mutations."

About 80-90% of LQTS type 2-associated hERG mutants are estimated to suffer from defective trafficking (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sanguinetti, 2010</a>). The corresponding number for LQTS-associated K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and KCNE1 mutants is not known. Previous studies identify both trafficking defective and trafficking competent K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and KCNE1 mutants,\u00a0e.g. (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sanguinetti, 2010</a>). We are mainly interested in understanding the mechanism that underlies abnormal gating of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and KCNE1 mutants. To avoid mutants with severe trafficking defects, we therefore selected mutants that have previously been shown to localize abundantly enough to the cell membrane to generate detectable K<sup>+</sup> currents. Several of the selected mutants have been shown to traffic well in mammalian systems (K<sub>V</sub>7.1/V215M and KCNE1/S74L [<a href=\"#bib14\">Eldstrom et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Harmer et al., 2010</a>]) or generate clearly detectable currents in mammalian cells (K<sub>V</sub>7.1/R583C [<a href=\"#bib56\">Yang et al., 2002</a>]). Our <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte experiments that compare mutant current amplitudes with wild-type current amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) suggest that the reduced ability of the selected mutants to generate currents in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes may largely be explained by the shifted <i>G</i>(<i>V</i>) of mutants. Trafficking defects could be disguised in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes that are cultured at low temperatures that may rescue some trafficking defects (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Delisle et al., 2004</a>). These current amplitude experiments should therefore be interpreted with caution until trafficking of specific K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and KCNE1 LQTS mutants in mammalian systems has been explored. Previous studies show that membrane expression of trafficking-defect channel mutants (e.g. for K<sub>V</sub>11.1 and CFTR) can be pharmacologically rescued using compounds that are suggested to stabilize channel conformation during folding and trafficking (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Delisle et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sato et al., 1996</a>). However, rescue of membrane expression may only partially compensate for mutation-induced loss of function, if these mutants also suffer from defective gating (<a href=\"#bib37\">Perry et al., 2016</a>). Our proposed N-AT model for pharmacological correction of \u2018<i>G</i>(<i>V</i>)\u2019 LQTS mutants could therefore potentially complement pharmacological correction of trafficking-defect LQTS mutants to improve the outcome of patients suffering from LQTS."

We therefore initially hypothesized that N-AT only would restore the function of those LQTS mutations with altered S4 movement. We were pleasantly surprised when N-AT seems to be able to restore the function of many LQTS and LQTS-like mutants, with diverse mutational defects (such as S225L and F351A). Using voltage clamp fluorometry, we have previously shown that both the main gating charge movement and the gate opening of K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels are accompanied by fluorescence signals from fluorophores attached to S4 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</a>). This suggests that S4 moves both during the main gating charge movement and during the subsequent channel opening in K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</a>), which is similar to observations in Shaker K<sub>V</sub> channels (<a href=\"#bib7\">B\u00f6rjesson and Elinder, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pathak et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Phillips and Swartz, 2010</a>). Therefore, N-AT could affect both the main gating charge movement and gate opening by acting on the S4 voltage sensor, as has been shown for hanatoxin which targets the voltage-sensing domain in the Shaker K<sub>V</sub> channel (<a href=\"#bib25\">Milescu et al., 2013</a>). This hypothesis is supported by our voltage-clamp fluorometry experiments using K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L and K<sub>V</sub>7.1/F351A in which N-AT accelerates the fluorescence components associated with both the main S4 movement (<i>F</i>1) and gate opening (<i>F</i>2), as well as accelerates the kinetics of channel opening. This proposed mechanism would explain why N-AT can restore the function of mutations that mainly target either\u00a0the main S4 movement or gate opening. However, the dramatic decrease in the fluorescence signal caused by N-AT makes it hard for us to completely\u00a0determine\u00a0the effect of N-AT on the <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) of mutants. Therefore, the complete mechanism of N-AT in the different mutations is not clear."

Currents were measured at room temperature 2\u20135 days after injection with the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique (CA-1B amplifier, Dagan, MN). For the current amplitude experiments presented in <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, the current amplitude of mutants were normalized to the current amplitude of wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 expressed in the same batch of oocytes and incubated under identical conditions for the same time period. Currents were sampled at 1\u20133.3 kHz, filtered at 500 Hz, and not leakage corrected. The control solution contained (in mM): 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 15 HEPES, 0.4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.8 MgCl<sub>2</sub> (pH adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH). The holding voltage was generally set to \u201380 mV. Activation curves were generally elicited by stepping to test voltages between \u2013110 and\u00a0+60 mV (3\u20135 s durations and 10 mV increments) followed by a tail voltage of \u201320 mV. Voltage clamp fluorometry experiments were performed as previously described on oocytes labeled for 30 min with 100 \u00b5M Alexa-488-maleimide (Molecular Probes) at 4\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Osteen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Osteen et al., 2012</a>). For voltage clamp fluorometry experiments on K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*, the holding voltage was \u201380 mV, the pre-pulse \u2013120 mV for 2 s, and test voltages ranging between \u2013140 and\u00a0+80 mV for 3 s in 20 mV increments. The tail voltage was \u201380 mV. For K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/KCNE1, the holding voltage was \u201380 mV, the pre-pulse \u2013160 mV for 5 s, and test voltages ranging between \u2013160 and\u00a0+80 mV for 5 s in 20 mV increments. The tail voltage was \u201340 mV. N-arachidonoyl taurine was purchased from Cayman Chemical (MI, USA) and stored, diluted and applied to the oocyte chamber as previously described (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liin et al., 2015</a>).

To make this point, the authors focus on two mutations, S225L and F351A, drawing the conclusion that the S225L mutation produces a rightward shift in voltage-sensor activation while the F351A mutation largely results in less effective channel opening once voltage-sensors are activated. The results are nicely supported by a comparison of fluorescence-voltage and conductance-voltage curves for each construct with for K<sub>v</sub>7.1 expressed alone or when coexpressed with KCNE1. To validate the idea that each mutation does reduce activation in mechanistically distinct ways, the authors use previously developed models of K<sub>v</sub>7.1 activation +/- KCNE1 to show that a 50 mV rightward shift in VSD activation nicely accounts for both the FV and GV shifts for the S225L mutation, while the F351A mutations can be approximated by a +140 mV shift in the voltage-dependence of channel opening. Although this approach to validate the idea that the two mutations inhibit K<sub>v</sub>7.1 activation by distinct mechanism might be viewed as somewhat dependent on the validity of the activation models (which remains a bit uncertain), the fact that changes in largely a single parameter accounts for the FV and GV relationships both in the absence and presence of KCNE1 is satisfying."

Given the large effects of N-AT on fluorescence, should we be concerned about interpreting small changes in kinetics? Were the traces in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> normalized to allow comparison of the temporal properties? Although the authors would like to conclude that N-AT has generalized effects that affect both the VSD activation and channel opening, it seems like it could still be the case that effects on channel opening are primary. As such, the FV and GV data might help put this issue on firmer foundation."

Although the reviewers were somewhat divergent in their initial enthusiasm for the manuscript, after discussion there was consensus that the study would need substantial work to be appropriate for <i>eLife</i>. All three reviewers offer specific suggestions, which you should consider carefully in going forward with publication. These include 1) clarification of the mechanism by which the two studied mutants affect gating, 2) examination of the impact of mutations on surface levels of the KCNQ channel in order to assess whether restoring the gating properties with PUFs would be sufficient to correct the deficits produced by the mutants, and 3) clarification of the impact of PUFs on other ion channels, cardiac action potentials and EKGs. The overarching concern was that insufficient evidence was presented to support the potential therapeutic utility of PUFs. Our policy is to reject manuscripts requiring the amount of effort that we feel yours would require, but we hope that the reviews will be helpful in revising your manuscript for publication elsewhere.

They see that the mutants alter the voltage-activation relations to varying degrees, but typically shifting activation to positive voltages, slowing activation and speeding deactivation. From comparisons of the F-V and G-V relations in the absence and presence of KCNE, the authors propose that the one mutant located in S4 alters voltage-sensor activation while another located in S6 alters pore opening. They then show that a polyunsaturated fatty (PFU) acid can correct the effects of the mutants, and do proof of concept experiments in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and guinea pig hears where a KCNQ inhibitor is used to induce LQT and show that the PUF can restore normal LQT. This is an interesting study because it attempts to understand disease causing mutations at a mechanistic level and provides proof of concept evidence that PFU could potentially be used to correct the deficit. Although the authors' interpretations are plausible, the data are not always so clean and I can imagine more complex mechanisms may be involved."

The data to me seem much more complex than the authors acknowledge. I would like to see a clearer presentation of the evidence supporting the key conclusions and a more nuanced discussion of the underlying complexity.

Like others, they have found that such mutants have altered voltage-dependence of channel opening, and changed closing kinetics, that can be partially normalized by \"heterozygous\" expression. N-AT moves activation back to more negative potentials in the LQT mutants, as the authors have previously shown for I<sub>Ks</sub>, and N-AT accelerates all components of fluorescence movement from the mutant channels incorporating G219C. In addition, it is shown that N-AT can affect action potential duration in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and intact guinea-pig hearts, although these data are less convincing. The significance of this work is that N-AT is an activator of both wild type K<sub>v</sub>7.1 +KCNE1 and LQTS mutants. It does not seem so surprising, or indeed particularly significant that N-AT affects LQT mutants in the same way as WT channels. The authors have already reported that PUFA analogues shift the activation gating of K<sub>v</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels, so it is to be expected that the LQT mutants have their activation affected as well, as simple missense mutants. Given that, most of the biophysics presented is logical and seems to suggest that N-AT acts non-specifically on the channels (unlike their previous suggestion that WT channels are affected by an \"electrostatic mechanism\" affecting the VSD). For most in the field, interest in this work is lessened as it is generally accepted that about 2/3 of LQT phenotypes come about as a result of lowered expression at the cell surface from misfolding and other events during synthesis and trafficking."

In the intact hearts it looks like other changes affect the early action potential to shorten it in the presence of N-AT. Changes in the isoelectric region of the EKG suggest a dispersion of action potential effects by N-AT. In intact hearts, the slope of phase 3 repolarization in the HMR+N-AT trace is shallower than in control or with HMR1556 alone. This suggests less net outward current when N-AT is added, the opposite of what is contended. Perhaps this is because N-AT blocks many other cardiac currents."

This is an exciting and interesting conclusion. The paper is clearly written and the results are straight forwards and support the conclusions. A particularly compelling aspect of the paper is that the authors show that N-AT can rescue function in two mechanistically distinct types of LQTS mutants, those likely to affect voltage sensor function and those affecting channel opening equilibria. This provides some assurance that this sort of pharmacological strategy might have general applicability for a number of different categories of LQTS mutations."

To test whether N-AT is a collisional quencher, we monitored the fluorescence from unbound Alexa488 in control solution and in N-AT-supplemented control solution (up to 0.5 M N-AT). In these experiments where no oocytes or channels were present, we did not see any quenching effect of N-AT on Alexa488 fluorescence, suggesting that N-AT is not a collisional quencher of Alexa488. N-AT actually slightly increases the Alexa488 fluorescence by 10-20% (in 0.5 M N-AT, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Although further experiments will be required to fully understand how N-AT decreases the fluorescence from Alexa-488 bound to K<sub>v</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels, these experiments suggest that the reduced fluorescence observed in our voltage clamp fluorometry experiments are not caused by direct N-AT quenching of the fluorophore. Instead, it is possible that N-AT induces some rearrangement in the channel that brings some unknown K<sub>v</sub>7.1 or KCNE1 residue, such as a trp, close to Alexa488 and thereby N-AT indirectly quenches the fluorescence."

During this time course, roughly 50% of the fluorescence signal disappears (now shown in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). As a consequence, the voltage-dependent changes in fluorescence intensity caused by the S4 movement will be underestimated at more positive voltages compared to negative voltages (we run the protocol from negative to positive test voltages). In addition, the <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) curves for WT K<sub>v</sub>7.1+KCNE1 and K<sub>v</sub>7.1/F351A+KCNE1 channels are hard to normalize (especially when N-AT has reduced the fluorescence signal to noise), due to not complete saturation at either the negative or positive end of the <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) curve. We therefore feel that we presently are unable to reliably quantify N-AT-induced shifts in the <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) curve for WT K<sub>v</sub>7.1+KCNE1 and K<sub>v</sub>7.1/F351A+KCNE1. However, we now include a normalized <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) curve of K<sub>v</sub>7.1/G219C*/S225L+KCNE1 (which shows better saturation at both ends of the <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) curve) in the presence of N-AT, to compare to the corresponding <i>F</i>(<i>V</i>) in control solution (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

We have now included some more discussion and added kinetic modeling to show that our proposed mechanisms for these two mutations are plausible. In this kinetic modeling, we have used the two models that our group has previously developed for wild type K<sub>v</sub>7.1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> channels (Osteen et al., 2012; Barro-Soria et al., 2014). These models are based on extensive data from many types of experiments (ionic currents, gating currents, fluorescence, linked constructs, complex voltage protocols). We feel that we have earlier extensively shown that the main reason for why the GV and FV overlap are that K<sub>v</sub>7.1 channels open after only a subset of S4s are activated (Osteen et al., 2012). In contrast, I<sub>Ks</sub> channels need all four S4s to be activated before they open (Osteen et al., 2012; Barro-Soria et al., 2014). The main result supporting these two activation mechanisms is our data from linked K<sub>v</sub>7.1 subunits with different numbers of permanently activated S4s (Osteen et al. 2012). Linked K<sub>v</sub>7.1 channels with two permanently activated S4s are open even at hyperpolarized potentials where the two wt S4s have clearly deactivated, showing that K<sub>v</sub>7.1 channels open even with a subset of S4s activated. In contrast, the same linked construct co-expressed with KCNE1 is closed at hyperpolarized voltages, showing that I<sub>Ks</sub> channels don\u2019t open after only a subset of S4s have activated. Using these two models, we can show that S225L can be explained in both models by just shifting the voltage dependence of the main S4 movement, whereas F351A can be explained in both models by just shifting the voltage dependence of opening. That the effects of each mutation can be explained in both the K<sub>v</sub>7.1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> models by changing a single parameter (different in each mutation) by the same amount is a strong argument for the robustness of the models and the proposed hypothesized mechanisms of the two mutations. Of course, more complex mechanisms of action of these mutations could also generate the same effects on the currents and fluorescence, but we here present the mechanisms we feel are the most simple that can explain most of the phenotypes."

The model that is most similar to ours is the model from Jianmin Cui\u2019s group (Zaydman et al., 2014). In principle, Jianmin\u2019s and our models are very similar: the main difference is that their models have more states and ours are simplified versions of their models. Unfortunately, they use parameters from the model by Rudy and Silva (e.g. a slow S4 and a fast gate), which we have shown is not compatible with more complex triple pulse voltage protocols (Barro-Soria et al., 2014). So the actual parameters in their model would have to be refitted to more complex voltage protocols before their models can be used. However, we now acknowledge that there are other models for K<sub>v</sub>7.1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> and that our conclusions about the mechanism of the mutations are model dependent. However, independent of what models are used to describe the channel, it is clear from the differences in their effects on the fluorescence that these two mutations affect the channels by different mechanisms and that N-AT restores most of the function in both mutations."
