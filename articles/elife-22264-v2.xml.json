An additional linkage for \u03b15 and \u03b1IIb is the synergy site located in close proximity to the RGD motif. We report that mice with a dysfunctional FN-synergy motif (<i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></i>) suffer from surprisingly mild platelet adhesion and bleeding defects due to delayed thrombus formation after vessel injury. Additional loss of \u03b23 integrins dramatically aggravates the bleedings and severely compromises smooth muscle cell coverage of the vasculature leading to embryonic lethality. Cell-based studies revealed that the synergy site is dispensable for the initial contact of \u03b15\u03b21 with the RGD, but essential to re-enforce the binding of \u03b15\u03b21/\u03b1IIb\u03b23 to FN. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for the FN synergy site when external forces exceed a certain threshold or when \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin levels decrease below a critical level."

An additional linkage for \u03b15 and \u03b1IIb is the synergy site located in close proximity to the RGD motif. We report that mice with a dysfunctional FN-synergy motif (<i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></i>) suffer from surprisingly mild platelet adhesion and bleeding defects due to delayed thrombus formation after vessel injury. Additional loss of \u03b23 integrins dramatically aggravates the bleedings and severely compromises smooth muscle cell coverage of the vasculature leading to embryonic lethality. Cell-based studies revealed that the synergy site is dispensable for the initial contact of \u03b15\u03b21 with the RGD, but essential to re-enforce the binding of \u03b15\u03b21/\u03b1IIb\u03b23 to FN. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for the FN synergy site when external forces exceed a certain threshold or when \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin levels decrease below a critical level."

                        "text": "Fibronectin (FN) is a large extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein that triggers biochemical and mechanical signaling via integrin binding. FN is essential for mammalian development and tissue regeneration, and can influence disease such as cancer progression. FN is abundant in blood and in most tissues and is present in provisional matrices of healing wounds and in the stroma of tumors. FN is secreted as a disulfide-bonded dimer, assembled into fibrils of variable diameters and then crosslinked into a fibrillar network of variable rigidity (<a href=\"#bib26\">Leiss et al., 2008</a>) that binds to and serves as a scaffold for numerous other ECM molecules. FN consists of three different repeating Ig-like folded units, called type I-III modules. Whereas type I and II modules are stabilized by internal disulfide bonds, the 15 type III repeats of FN lack disulfide bonds, which confers elasticity to FN fibrils and the ability to modulate fibril rigidity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Erickson, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Oberhauser et al., 2002</a>). The major cell-binding site in FN is an arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motif located in the 10<sup>th</sup> type III module (FNIII10) that is recognized by \u03b15\u03b21, \u03b1IIb\u03b23, and \u03b1v-class integrins. In addition to the RGD motif, FN harbors the so-called FN synergy site in the FNIII9 module (<a href=\"#bib31\">Obara et al., 1988</a>), which binds \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrins but not \u03b1v-class integrins (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bowditch et al., 1994</a>). The synergy site encompasses the DRVPHSRN sequence in mouse FN and site directed mutagenesis identified the two arginine residues to be essential for all synergy site-induced functions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aota et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Friedland et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chada et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Nagae et al., 2012</a>)."

Based on the crystal structures, the RGD motif forms a flexible loop that physically interacts with both the \u03b15 and \u03b21 integrin subunits, while the synergy site contacts only the head domain of the \u03b1 subunit (<a href=\"#bib35\">Redick et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Nagae et al., 2012</a>). The synergy site has been studied using protein- and cell-based assays, which produced different results giving rise to diverse hypotheses regarding the mechanistic properties. One hypothesis based on ultra-structural analyses of the recombinant \u03b15\u03b21 ectodomain and the FNIII7-10 polypeptide proposes that the synergy site aligns the binding interface of the integrin heterodimer with the RGD motif to increase the on-rate constant (<i>K</i><sub>on</sub>) of \u03b15\u03b21 binding to FN (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leahy et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Garc\u00eda et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Takagi et al., 2003</a>). A combination of theoretical and cell-based studies with FRET sensors inserted into the linker region between FNIII9 and FNIII10 concluded that cell-induced forces reversibly stretch the linker, separate the FN-RGD motif from the synergy site and switch the binding of \u03b15\u03b21 integrins to \u03b1v-class integrins (<a href=\"#bib18\">Grant et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Krammer et al., 2002</a>). Finally, using a spinning disk device, it was shown that the engagement of the synergy site allows FN-\u03b15\u03b21 bonds (or FN-\u03b1IIb\u03b23 bonds on platelets) to resist shear forces, suggesting that force exposure allows to switch the bonds from a relaxed to a tensioned state, leading to an extension of the FN-integrin bond lifetime and to adhesion strengthening (<a href=\"#bib11\">Friedland et al., 2009</a>). Although these in vitro studies highlight the importance of \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin-binding to the synergy site, the mode of action is still unclear and the apparently important roles of these interactions have never been scrutinized in vivo using genetic loss-of-function approaches."

To test the extent of bond tensioning on pFN<sup>syn</sup>, we seeded\u00a0(15, 30 and 60 min)\u00a0serum-starved <i>Fn1</i>-KO fibroblasts onto pFN<sup>wt</sup>- and pFN<sup>syn</sup>-coated substrates, respectively, spun them and treated them with 3,3'-dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidyl propionate; DTSSP) to crosslink extracellular secondary amines that are within 1.2 nm proximity to each other. We found that the amount of \u03b15 integrins crosslinked to FN in <i>Fn1</i>-KO fibroblasts was reduced to 60% on pFN<sup>syn</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Upon spinning, <i>Fn1</i>-KO cells increased the proportion of \u03b15 integrins crosslinked to pFN<sup>wt</sup>. Importantly, in cells on pFN<sup>syn</sup>, the tension was unable to increase the number of crosslinked bonds upon spinning and their numbers remained at the same levels as before spinning (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), which altogether indicates that the spinning force strengthens \u03b15\u03b21-mediated adhesion to FN in a synergy site-dependent manner. Furthermore and in line with a report showing that the conversion of FN-\u03b15\u03b21 bonds from a relaxed to a tensioned state induces phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) on Y397 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Guan et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kornberg et al., 1992</a>), pY397-FAK levels were reduced by 54% when cells were plated on pFN<sup>syn</sup> compared to pFN<sup>wt</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Importantly, phosphorylation of Y861-FAK, which occurs independent of substrate binding (<a href=\"#bib42\">Shi and Boettiger, 2003</a>), was indistinguishable in cells seeded on pFN<sup>wt</sup> or pFN<sup>syn</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Since the intensity of FAK Y397 phosphorylation was shown to operate as a sensor for ECM rigidity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Seong et al., 2013</a>), we conclude that fibroblasts attached to pFN<sup>syn</sup> perceive insufficient information regarding substrate stiffness."

To test this hypothesis, we seeded pan-integrin-null fibroblasts (pKO) reconstituted with \u03b21-class integrins to express \u03b15\u03b21 (pKO-\u03b21), or with \u03b1v integrins (pKO-\u03b1v) to express \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins, or with both \u03b21 and \u03b1v integrins (pKO-\u03b1v/\u03b21) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schiller et al., 2013</a>) on pFN<sup>wt</sup>- and pFN<sup>syn</sup>-coated substrates and evaluated cell adhesion, spreading, and adhesion site formation. From the three cell lines, only pKO-\u03b21 cells exhibited reduced adhesion on pFN<sup>syn</sup> compared to pFN<sup>wt</sup> at all-time points analyzed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Moreover, pKO-\u03b21 cells had significantly fewer FAs, contained fewer stress fibers, and spread less on pFN<sup>syn</sup> compared to pFN<sup>wt</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013F</a>, see <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">4</a> and still images in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, the areas of FAs determined with paxillin and \u03b21 integrin stainings were significantly reduced on pFN<sup>syn</sup> compared to pFN<sup>wt</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>), which altogether suggests that pFN<sup>syn</sup>-bound \u03b15\u03b21 integrins fail to organize functional adhesion sites and to induce contractile stress fibers required for cell spreading. pKO-\u03b1v cells adhered and spread similarly on pFN<sup>wt</sup> and pFN<sup>syn</sup>, and developed comparably large, paxillin-positive FAs that were anchored to thick stress fibers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>). Importantly, pKO-\u03b1v/\u03b21 cells also showed the same adhesion and spreading behavior, and developed similar adhesion sites on pFN<sup>syn</sup> indicating that \u03b1v-containing integrins compensate for the absence of a functional synergy site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,E</a>). Interestingly, the pKO-\u03b1v/\u03b21 cells do not show a delay in the transition from NAs to mature FAs on pFN<sup>syn</sup>, as we observed with <i>Fn1</i>-KO cells, which could be due to the significantly higher \u03b23 and lower \u03b15 integrin cell surface levels on pKO-\u03b1v/\u03b21 as compared to <i>Fn1</i>-KO cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>)."

These findings gave rise to the hypothesis that the synergy site contributes to accelerate the initial encounter of \u03b15\u03b21 with FN-RGD, which was in conflict with our observations that adhesion initiation was unaffected in <i>Fn1</i>-KO cells seeded on pFN<sup>syn</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). To further test whether the synergy site is required for the FN binding on-rate, we quantified the probability of pKO-\u03b21, pKO-\u03b1v, pKO-\u03b1v/\u03b21 and pKO cells binding to FNIII7-10<sup>wt</sup> or FNIII7-10<sup>syn</sup> fragments and to purified full-length pFN<sup>wt</sup> or pFN<sup>syn</sup> using single-cell force spectroscopy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I,J</a>). To this end, a single cell was attached to the ConA-coated cantilever, lowered onto the FN with a speed of 1 \u00b5m/s until a contact force of 200 pN was recorded. After a very short contact time of \u2248 50 ms, cell and substrate were separated to detect the rupture of the few specific bonds formed between integrins and FN. On FNIII7-10<sup>wt</sup>, the experiments revealed a 3-fold higher binding probability of pKO-\u03b1v and pKO-\u03b1v/\u03b21 cells compared to pKO-\u03b21 cells, indicating that \u03b1v\u03b23 integrins have a higher affinity for FN-RGD than \u03b15\u03b21 integrins. Similar results were observed with full-length pFN<sup>wt</sup> or pFN<sup>syn</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). Interestingly, however, full-length pFN showed higher binding probability than fragments for all cell lines tested including the pKO cells that lack integrin expression, which altogether suggests that in addition to integrins also other FN-binding cell surface receptor(s) contribute to the initial binding."

Out of the 335 offspring altogether, one instead of the expected 38 compound homozygous <i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup>;Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice survived to P21.

We therefore hypothesized that the platelet functions are severely compromised in <i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup>;Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></i> embryos as they lack \u03b1IIb\u03b23-mediated binding to fibrinogen and FN (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), as well as the ability to strengthen adhesion and signaling via \u03b15\u03b21 integrin-mediated binding to FN. To test the hypothesis, we performed spreading assays as well as adhesion assays under flow with wild-type or <i>Itgb3</i><sup>-/-</sup> platelets. The mean spreading area of wild-type platelets seeded for 60 min on fibrinogen, pFN<sup>wt</sup>, and pFN<sup>syn</sup> was 15\u201316 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>. As expected, <i>Itgb3</i><sup>-/-</sup> platelets failed to spread on fibrinogen (mean spreading area of 4.6 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>). Furthermore, they showed a reduced mean spreading area of 8.9 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> on pFN<sup>wt</sup> and failed to spread on pFN<sup>syn</sup> (mean spreading area of 3.8 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). Application of shear flow reduced adhesion of wild-type platelets to pFN<sup>syn</sup> by 10-fold compared to pFN<sup>wt</sup>, while adhesion of <i>Itgb3</i>-null platelets was lost on fibrinogen as well as pFN<sup>syn</sup>, and only slightly diminished on pFN<sup>wt</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). Importantly, adhesion and spreading of platelets isolated from <i>Itgb3</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice to collagen were unaffected, irrespective of whether shear flow was applied or not (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,E</a>)."

While immunostaining of E11.5 whole mount embryos with an anti-PECAM-1 antibody revealed that the vessels in the trunk of <i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup>;Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></i> embryos showed normal sprouting (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), the arteries and veins of the dermal vasculature of E15.5 embryos were tortuous and irregularly covered with \u03b1-SMA-positive cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Furthermore, the vascular network was less intricate and had significantly fewer branching points in <i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup>;Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></i> embryos compared to wild-type littermates (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Interestingly, collagen IV immunostaining indicated that many small vessels in E15.5 <i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup>;Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></i> embryos lacked a clear lumen and PECAM-1 immunosignals (see arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

Moreover, small vessels in <i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup>;Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></i> embryos were often less covered by pericytes. Instead, NG2-positive pericytes were either detached or formed patchy aggregates on the vessel surface (see arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>).

The replacement of the FNIII10 RGD motif with the RGE in mice also affects mesoderm development, although less severe and restricted to the vascular system and to the posterior region of the developing embryo (<a href=\"#bib44\">Takahashi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gir\u00f3s et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, these defects resemble those observed in <i>Itga5</i>-deficient mice indicating that the RGE mutation is sufficient to abrogate \u03b15\u03b21 integrin function and that the synergy site cannot compensate for a dysfunctional RGD motif. Furthermore, the normal development of <i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></i> mice also excludes an essential role of the synergy site for \u03b15 integrin function in vivo (<a href=\"#bib18\">Grant et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Krammer et al., 2002</a>). A reduced \u03b15\u03b21 integrin function would probably have occurred if the synergy site would indeed guide the binding pocket of \u03b15\u03b21 towards the RGD motif and increase the FN-binding on-rate (<a href=\"#bib43\">Takagi et al., 2003</a>). However, the absence of obvious \u2018\u03b15\u03b21-loss-of-function defects\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yang et al., 1993</a>) in <i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></i> mice and the normal FN-binding on-rates of pKO-\u03b21 cells in single-cell force spectroscopy experiments indicate that the synergy site is probably dispensable to accelerate \u03b15\u03b21 integrin-FN binding."

Apparently, the high myosin II-induced forces generated by these cells are only efficiently absorbed with either high \u03b1v-class integrin surface levels or a fully functional FN. Whether a similar functional relationship operates also during paraxial mesoderm, whose formation critically depends on the expression of \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b1v-class integrins (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yang et al., 1999</a>), cannot be deduced from our experiments. However, the normal mesoderm formation in <i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></i> mice indicates that mesodermal cells require \u03b15\u03b21 to bind the RGD motif but not the synergy site. Interestingly, we also find clear evidence for a compensatory role of the FN synergy site and \u03b1v-class integrins for cell spreading and FA maturation in vitro (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), which differs from previous reports showing that \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b1v-class integrins have non-overlapping functions for inducing myosin contractility (<a href=\"#bib38\">Schiller et al., 2013</a>) or controlling directional migration (<a href=\"#bib27\">Missirlis et al., 2016</a>)."

Our findings revealed that the FN synergy site is critically important for the adhesion of wild type platelets in in vitro flow chamber settings, while impaired spreading or defects under static adhesion only arise when \u03b1IIb\u03b23 expression is lost. These findings indicate that the synergy site plays a central role as soon as force is applied to the bonds between FN and platelet integrins. A similar force-dependent requirement of the synergy site was also apparent after arteriolar injuries in vivo, which showed that <i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></i> mice display diminished platelet adhesion and delayed thrombus formation. This requirement of the synergy site for platelets to resist the shear forces of the blood flow also provides a rational explanation for the prolonged bleeding times observed in <i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></i> mice after tail tip excisions. Interestingly, the in vivo platelet dysfunctions in <i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup></i> mice as well as <i>Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice profoundly aggravate in compound <i>Fn1<sup>syn/syn</sup>;Itgb3<sup>-/-</sup></i> embryos where they cause fatal bleedings and an insufficient platelet-mediated separation of the lymphatic vessels from the cardinal vein. Since murine platelets contain around 100 times more \u03b1IIb\u03b23 than \u03b15\u03b21 integrins (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zeiler et al., 2014</a>) the compensation of the entire \u03b1IIb\u03b23 pool by the minor \u03b15\u03b21-FN<sup>wt</sup> complexes underscores the fundamental role of the adhesion strengthening property of the synergy site in FN."

For substrate coatings, 200 \u00b5m thick four-segmented polydimethylsilane (PDMS) mask fused to the surface of glass bottom Petri dishes (WPI, Sarasota, FL, USA) was used (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yu et al., 2015</a>). Each of the four PDMS framed glass surfaces were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C either with the FNIII7-10<sup>wt</sup> or FNIII7-10<sup>syn</sup> fragments or full-length FN (50 \u00b5g/ml) in PBS. For SCFS, we mounted an AFM (Nanowizard II, JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) on an inverted fluorescence microscope (<a href=\"#bib34\">Puech et al., 2006</a>) (Observer Z1/A1, Zeiss, Germany). The temperature was kept at 37\u00b0C throughout the experiment by a Petri dish heater (JPK Instruments,Berlin,\u00a0Germany). 200 \u00b5m long tip-less V-shaped silicon nitride cantilevers having nominal spring constants of 0.06 N/m (NP-0, Bruker, USA) were used. Each cantilever was calibrated prior the measurement by determining its sensitivity and spring constant using the thermal noise analysis of the AFM (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hutter and Bechhoefer, 1993</a>). To adhere a single fibroblast to the AFM cantilever, overnight serum-starved fibroblasts with confluency up to \u224880% were washed with PBS, trypsin-detached for\u00a0up\u00a0to 2 min, suspended in SCFS media (DMEM supplemented with 20 mM HEPES) containing 1% (v/v) FCS, pelleted and resuspended in serum free SCFS media. Fibroblasts were allowed to recover for at least 30 min from trypsin treatment. Adhesion of a single fibroblast to the free cantilever end was achieved by pipetting the fibroblast suspension onto the functionalized Petri dishes. The functionalized cantilever was lowered onto a fibroblast with a speed of 1 \u00b5m/s until a force of 1 nN was recorded. After \u22485 s contact, the cantilever was retracted with 1 \u00b5m/s for 10 \u00b5m and the\u00a0cantilever bound fibroblast was incubated for 7\u201310 min to assure firm binding to the cantilever. Using differential interference contract (DIC) microscopy, the morphological state of the fibroblast was monitored. For single molecule sensitivity, the fibroblast bound to the cantilever was lowered onto the coated substrate with a speed of 1 \u00b5m/s until a contact force of 200 pN was recorded for \u224850 ms contact time. Subsequently, the cantilever was retracted at 1 \u00b5m/s and for\u00a0\u226513 \u00b5m until the fibroblast and substrate were fully separated. After the experimental cycle, the fibroblast was allowed to recover for 0.5 s. For each measurement, the area of the substrate was varied. Force-distance curves were analyzed to determine binding probability using JPK software. Mann-Whitney tests were applied to determine significant differences between the binding probability of fibroblast lines at different conditions. Tests were done using Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla, USA)."

Furthermore, fibrinogen and importantly fibrin should be easily visible in the platelet aggregates, to avoid giving the readers a wrong impression that FN alone is sufficient to mediate platelet aggregation. Fibrin is found to be required for FN to support platelet aggregation (Reheman A, Blood, 2009; Wang Y, JCI, 2014). Another important fact is that FN and fibrin fibrils are more abundant close to the vessel wall.</i>"
