Traditionally, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via homomeric acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) was considered to be the leading cause of ischemic acidotoxicity. Here we show that extracellular protons trigger a novel form of neuronal necroptosis via ASIC1a, but independent of its ion-conducting function. We identified serine/threonine kinase receptor interaction protein 1 (RIP1) as a critical component of this form of neuronal necroptosis. Acid stimulation recruits RIP1 to the ASIC1a C-terminus, causing RIP1 phosphorylation and subsequent neuronal death. In a mouse model of focal ischemia, middle cerebral artery occlusion causes ASIC1a-RIP1 association and RIP1 phosphorylation in affected brain areas. Deletion of the <i>Asic1a</i> gene significantly prevents RIP1 phosphorylation and brain damage, suggesting ASIC1a-mediated RIP1 activation has an important role in ischemic neuronal injury. Our findings indicate that extracellular protons function as a novel endogenous ligand that triggers neuronal necroptosis during ischemia via ASIC1a independent of its channel function."

Traditionally, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via homomeric acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) was considered to be the leading cause of ischemic acidotoxicity. Here we show that extracellular protons trigger a novel form of neuronal necroptosis via ASIC1a, but independent of its ion-conducting function. We identified serine/threonine kinase receptor interaction protein 1 (RIP1) as a critical component of this form of neuronal necroptosis. Acid stimulation recruits RIP1 to the ASIC1a C-terminus, causing RIP1 phosphorylation and subsequent neuronal death. In a mouse model of focal ischemia, middle cerebral artery occlusion causes ASIC1a-RIP1 association and RIP1 phosphorylation in affected brain areas. Deletion of the <i>Asic1a</i> gene significantly prevents RIP1 phosphorylation and brain damage, suggesting ASIC1a-mediated RIP1 activation has an important role in ischemic neuronal injury. Our findings indicate that extracellular protons function as a novel endogenous ligand that triggers neuronal necroptosis during ischemia via ASIC1a independent of its channel function."

In some types of stroke, a blood clot cuts off the blood supply to part of the brain, depriving the brain cells of oxygen and other nutrients, including glucose. One of the consequences is that the blood-starved brain becomes more acidic, which triggers cell death. Protecting brain cells from acidity-induced death could therefore reduce the damage caused by a stroke, and may also be an effective treatment for other brain disorders that involve increased brain acidity, like multiple sclerosis and Huntington's disease."

A protein called the acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is thought to contribute to acid-induced cell death by allowing calcium to flow into cells. However, this increased flow of calcium occurs only briefly (for seconds) in response to increased acidity, which cannot explain why the severity of cell death strongly depends on the length of increased brain acidity that lasts for hours during stroke."

For example, ischemic stroke causes pronounced brain acidosis (\u223cpH 6.0), the treatment of which with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> resulted in a significant reduction in the infract volume (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pignataro et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, a similar neuroprotective effect was achieved via either pharmacological intervention or genetic deletion of acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), suggesting a critical role for ASIC1a in mediating ischemic acidotoxicity (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gao et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pignataro et al., 2007</a>). ASIC1a belongs to the H<sup>+</sup>-gated subgroup of the degenerin/epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel (DEG/ENaC) family of non-selective cation channels, widely expressed in central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wemmie et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2013</a>). To date, besides ischemic stroke, accumulating evidence from cell/animal models shows that ASIC1a is an effective molecular target for mitigating acid-induced neural damage in many other diseases including multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wemmie et al., 2013</a>). Thus, these previous findings strongly suggest that ASIC1a is the key extracellular proton receptor in neurons and the main mediator of acid-induced neuronal death. As such, ASIC1a may be a potential broad-spectrum therapeutic target in many neurological disorders (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wemmie et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2013</a>)."

                        "text": "However, despite the strong appreciation of its importance, the mechanism underlying ASIC1a-mediated acidic neuronal death remains poorly understood. Traditionally, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through homomeric ASIC1a channels has been considered to be the main cause of acidotoxicity (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yermolaieva et al., 2004</a>). Although intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation is generally responsible for cell death mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels, for example, NMDA receptors (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dong et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lai et al., 2014</a>), this hypothesis is incompatible with some intrinsic properties of ASIC1a channels. First, homomeric ASIC1a channels are completely desensitized after just a few seconds of continued exposure to extracellular acid, a phenomenon termed steady-state desensitization (<a href=\"#bib22\">Krishtal, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Duan et al., 2011</a>). Second, compared to many other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels, such as NMDA receptors, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of ASIC1a channels is relatively small (<a href=\"#bib32\">Samways et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Wang and Xu, 2011</a>). Thus, under pathological conditions with persistent acidosis (e.g., for hours), Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through ASIC1a channels should only occur in the first few seconds at the onset of acidosis, which would generate a negligible increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Samways et al., 2009</a>). It is unlikely that such a small change in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level can fully account for the dramatic neuronal damage mediated by ASIC1a under pathological conditions. Thus, additional mechanism(s) must be at work for ASIC1a-mediated neuronal death."

Traditionally, necrosis was considered to be an accidental, uncontrolled form of cell death (<a href=\"#bib34\">Syntichaki and Tavernarakis, 2003</a>). However, accumulating evidence now suggests that necrotic cell death may be accomplished by a set of signal transduction pathways and execution mechanisms (thus termed necroptosis) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Vandenabeele et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Linkermann and Green, 2014</a>). Recently, the serine/threonine kinase receptor interaction protein 1 (RIP1) was identified as the crucial mediator of this process, with RIP1 phosphorylation being the key step in necroptosis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Degterev et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Christofferson et al., 2014</a>). Blockade of RIP1 phosphorylation by the specific inhibitor, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), inhibited necroptosis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Degterev et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Christofferson et al., 2014</a>)."

In most studies, necroptosis was mainly induced by the activation of death receptors (DRs), for example, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) receptor, in the absence of caspase activation (<a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Vandenabeele et al., 2010</a>). Other endogenous initiators of necroptosis remain largely unknown. Here we report that extracellular protons trigger a novel form of necroptosis in neurons via ASIC1a, but independent of its ion-conducting function. Using RNA interference and pharmacological blockade, we identified RIP1 as a critical component in acid-induced neuronal death. RIP1 is recruited to ASIC1a within 30 min of acid stimulation, which causes RIP1 phosphorylation and triggers the downstream death events. Similarly, RIP1 became physically associated with ASIC1a and hyperphosphorylated in response to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice. The enhanced RIP1 phosphorylation in response to either ischemia or acidosis was undetected in neurons from <i>Asic1a</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, demonstrating the involvement of ASIC1a-mediated RIP1 activation in ischemic brain injury."

This effect was also suppressed by Nec-1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C1,C2</a>); acid-treated neurons retained their healthy appearance of cell bodies and neurites in the presence of Nec-1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C1</a>, bottom panel, DIC images), suggesting that neuronal functions may be preserved. Additionally, acid (pH 6.0)-induced neuronal damage was detected using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, which, unlike the CTB assay, is independent of mitochondrial metabolism, and the effect was inhibited by PcTX1, Nec-1, and 7-Cl-O-Nec-1 (Nec-1s), a derivative with improved specificity for RIP1 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Takahashi et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Importantly, drug pretreatment was necessary for neuronal protection, as co-applied Nec-1 or Nec-1s failed to inhibit acidic neuronal death (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), suggesting a key role for RIP1 at the onset of acidotoxicity. Consistent with the pharmacological intervention, RNA interference of endogenous RIP1 protected neurons from acid-induced death (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>).

However, the pH 6.0 treatment resulted in no obvious change in ROS levels in the neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and neither scavenging ROS by anti-oxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) nor blockade of ROS production by rotenone (RTO) or diphenylene iodonium (DPI) rescued neurons from acid-induced death (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These results indicate that ROS production is not necessary for acid-induced cell death, consistent with the previous finding (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2004</a>). Also, earlier reports showed that extracellular protons led to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yermolaieva et al., 2004</a>), which is one of the major causes of conventional necrotic cell death. Besides enhancing mitochondrial ROS production through activation of key enzymes of the Krebs cycle, Ca<sup>2+</sup> also triggers cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (cPLA<sub>2</sub>)-mediated necrosis (<a href=\"#bib39\">Vandenabeele et al., 2010</a>). However, a cPLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor, bromoenol lactone (BEL), failed to protect neurons from acid-induced death (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Removing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the treatment solution also had no clear protective effect in the present study (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The above results, thus, suggest that acid-induced neuronal death involves a form of RIP1-mediated necrosis which is independent of ROS and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Consistent with this idea, recent evidence showed that RIP1 was not involved in certain forms of intrinsic necrosis induced by ROS generators or Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophores (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sun et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2012</a>)."

This sensitivity to the rate of acidification is likely related to the fast desensitization of acid-induced ASIC1a current, because the acid-evoked activation of TRPV1 (either pH 6.0 or 5.0), which did not desensitize, was unaffected by the perfusion rate (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A,B,D</a>).

To verify the involvement of this pathway in ischemic brain injury, which is accompanied by severe tissue acidosis, with pH values typically falling to 6.5\u20136.0 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bassler et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Linkermann and Green, 2014</a>), we used a transient MCAO model to mimic ischemic stroke in mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Supporting the role of ASIC1a in mediating RIP1 activation in ischemic brain damage, we detected a physical association between RIP1 and ASIC1a only in the ischemic hemisphere but not the control hemisphere of the same brain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Importantly, 30 min MCAO, which was too short to cause obvious brain damage as shown by TTL staining (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), was sufficient to induce the ASIC1a-RIP1 association. Such association persisted for up to at least 2 hr (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), the longest duration of MCAO tested (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The long time window of ASIC1a-RIP1 complex formation is consistent with the notion that acidosis occurs slowly and progressively in the ischemic brain and both acidosis and necroptosis contribute mainly to delayed ischemic brain injury (<a href=\"#bib12\">Degterev et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pignataro et al., 2007</a>), a phase of neuronal damage with high clinical relevance because of the need for post-ischemic neuroprotection following stroke. Interestingly, the total protein level of RIP1 tended to decrease in the ischemic side of the brain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), similar to that observed in cultured cortical neurons subjected to acid treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F1,F2</a>). This lends additional support to the involvement of a similar regulatory mechanism between acid-induced neuronal death in vitro and ischemic brain damage in vivo. The phosphorylation of RIP1 is a critical event in brain ischemia and the blockade of RIP1 function with Nec-1 can significantly prevent ischemic brain injury (<a href=\"#bib12\">Degterev et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2008</a>). Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib12\">Degterev et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2008</a>), we observed increased RIP1 phosphorylation in ischemic brain from WT mice, which was successfully removed by treating the RIP1 immunoprecipitant for 1 hr with a bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, upper). By contrast, the level of RIP1 phosphorylation in the ischemic hemisphere of the <i>Asic1a</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice remained unchanged as compared to the control hemisphere (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, lower), demonstrating the critical role of ASIC1a in ischemia-induced RIP1 activation."

Compared to conventional DR-dependent necroptosis, ASIC1a-dependent necroptosis did not require de novo synthesized ligands and extracellular protons may serve as the fast \u2018extrinsic death signal\u2019. ASIC1a-dependent necroptosis does not require intrinsic ROS generation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting a different molecular mechanism from TNF-\u03b1-induced necroptosis. It has been shown previously that some forms of necroptosis are autophagy-dependent and do not rely on ROS (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bonapace et al., 2010</a>). Notably, acidosis was reported to induce cell autophagy (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wojtkowiak and Gillies, 2012</a>), suggesting a possible autophagy mechanism underlying ASIC1a-dependent necroptosis. Thus, further studies are needed to elucidate the detailed underlying mechanism(s) and clarify the similarities/differences between DR-dependent and ASIC1a-dependent necroptosis. Furthermore, as mentioned in the Introduction, deletion of the <i>Asic1a</i> gene strongly protects against ischemic neuronal death in a mouse model of focal ischemia (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2004</a>). A similar neuroprotective effect of Nec-1 was also observed in the same model (<a href=\"#bib12\">Degterev et al., 2005</a>). Additionally, both ASIC1a and RIP1 were reported as potential therapeutic targets in traumatic brain injury (<a href=\"#bib53\">You et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yin et al., 2013</a>). Importantly, we show here that RIP1 was recruited to ASIC1a in ischemic brains and the loss of ASIC1a prevented ischemia-induced RIP1 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013E</a>), suggesting that ASIC1a-mediated RIP1 activation is a key step in ischemic brain injury. The inability to activate RIP1 probably explains the resistance of <i>Asic1a</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice to ischemic brain damage. These findings, altogether, strongly suggest ASIC1a is an important up-stream factor regulating RIP1 in vivo. Because both ASIC1a and RIP1 are widely expressed in nervous systems (<a href=\"#bib12\">Degterev et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wemmie et al., 2006</a>) and tissue acidosis is a common feature of many neurological diseases, this novel DR-independent necroptosis probably contributes to neuronal injury in a broad range of neurological disorders."

The mtASIC1a functions quite differently from the plasma membrane ASIC1a. Although ASIC1a null neurons resisted H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced neuronal death, this effect was not reproduced with treatment with PcTX1, which cannot gain access to mtASIC1a localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). However, PcTX1 effectively inhibited acid-induced neuronal death through blocking plasma membrane ASIC1a. Furthermore, whereas mtASIC1a mainly contributed to ROS-induced neuronal death, ROS production was not involved in acid-induced neuronal death (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Although it cannot be ruled out that ionic fluxes through the channel pore may play a modulatory role, our data suggest that RIP1 activation but not ionic conduction per se is necessary for acid-induced necroptotic cell death (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Since ion channel activation reflects conformational changes induced by ligands and other gating factors, it is plausible that the acid-induced conformational change in ASIC1a channels exposes its proximal C-terminal region, represented by the CP-1 peptide (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), to trigger RIP1 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>) and the consequent neuronal necroptosis in response to tissue acidosis. Ironically, steady-state desensitization of the ASIC1a channel by moderate pH decreases, although it suppressed subsequent activation of ASIC1a current, did not prevent acid-induced neuronal death (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This differed from the neuroprotective effect of PcTX1, which is believed to inhibit ASIC1a activation by causing steady-state channel desensitization at neutral and alkaline pH (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2006</a>). Presumably, extracellular protons cause at least two steps in conformational changes in ASIC1a: one that exposes the C-terminal RIP1 activation domain and the other that mediates channel gating. Only the latter is blocked by the steady-state desensitization induced by the moderated pH decrease, whereas both are inhibited by PcTX1, especially because of the presence of PcTX1 throughout the entire period of pH 6.0 treatment. This could not be the case for pH 6.8 pretreatment as the switch to the pH 6.0 solution necessarily eliminated the condition (pH 6.8) that caused steady-state desensitization in the first place and the C-terminal RIP1 activation domain eventually adopts the acid-induced conformation. Consistent with the two-step conformational changes, AMI was protective against neuronal death when applied before, but not during acidosis, which differed from its action in blocking channel conductance (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4B,C</a>)."

For example, the ether-\u00e0-go-go (EAG) K<sup>+</sup> channel modulates cell proliferation via a mechanism independent of K<sup>+</sup> flux conducted by the channel (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hegle et al., 2006</a>) and certain Na<sup>+</sup> channel \u03b2 subunits contribute to cell adhesion without requiring Na<sup>+</sup> permeability (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kaczmarek, 2006</a>). Some channels are tightly associated with signaling molecules such as enzymes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kaczmarek, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Levitan, 2006</a>). A typical example is the EAG channel, which regulates the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hegle et al., 2006</a>). In another example, GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors are directly bound to phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), to contribute crucially to excitotoxicity in ischemic brain (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lai et al., 2014</a>). Others are multifunctional proteins containing clearly separate enzymatic and channel domains (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kaczmarek, 2006</a>). For example, the melastatin-related transient receptor potential 7 (TRPM7) channel contains a kinase domain at its cytoplasmic C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib31\">Runnels et al., 2001</a>). For ASIC1a channels, whether this occurs directly via auto-phosphorylation of RIP1 with its own kinase activity or indirectly by other associated kinase(s) requires further experimentation."

It is not uncommon for a protein to be multifunctional, but for an ion channel, the ion-conducting function probably attracts the most attention because of the well-developed methodologies and the rich information that can be acquired to characterize the channel. As a result, the non-conducting functions of ion channels have frequently been overlooked. This appears to be the case for ASIC1a. Ever since the protective role of <i>Asic1a</i> gene deletion on ischemic brain damage was reported, efforts have been made to understand the underlying mechanism(s) and nearly all reported studies focused on the ionic conduction, especially Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, mediated by these channels (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yermolaieva et al., 2004</a>). However, as mentioned above and in accordance with the new evidence shown in the current study, the ionic conductance and Ca<sup>2+</sup> toxicity hypothesis is incompatible with the observed time dependence of severity of acid-induced neuronal death, at least under in vitro conditions. Interestingly, the acid-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rise and whole-cell currents in neurons, although highly correlated with ASIC1a expression, only occurred with fast focal application of the acidic solution (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2,3</a>), a condition that rarely happens during the development of tissue acidosis. Previously, partial protection was attained by reducing extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] to 0.2 mM, leading to the conclusion that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was involved in acidic neuronal death (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2004</a>). However, the reduced extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] could cause other complications that compromised necroptotic death. Therefore, we removed extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> completely and observed no neuroprotection in the present study. We further show that the ability of ASIC1a to mediate acidotoxicity is independent of its ion-conducting function, but requires a C-terminal region of the channel protein. The sequence of CP-1 peptide that mimics acidosis in causing RIP1 phosphorylation and neuronal death represents a non-conserved region of ASIC C-termini (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), raising the possibility that the conduction-independent necroptotic effect of ASIC1a channels arose later in evolution than the channel conducting function, which is universal for nearly all ASICs."

However, although <i>Asic1a</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice exhibit abnormal synaptic activity and learning/memory deficits (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wemmie et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cho and Askwith, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Urbano et al., 2014</a>), the non-substantial contribution of ASIC1a channels to synaptic events, such as excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), is insufficient to account for the functions of these channels (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alvarez de la Rosa et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cho and Askwith, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kreple et al., 2014</a>). It might be possible that a conduction-independent mechanism was also involved in the synaptic function of ASIC1a channels. A knock-in mouse model carrying the non-conducting HIF-ASIC1a mutant would be a useful tool to examine this possibility in future studies."

Rectal and temporalis muscle temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C with a thermostatically controlled heating pad and lamp. A suture occlusion was made to the middle cerebral artery while cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored by transcranial laser Doppler. Animals whose blood flow did not reduce below 20% were excluded. For co-IP experiments, animals were killed and brains were removed immediately after MCAO of various durations of 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 hr.

At the end of treatment, the solution was replaced with the normal pH culture medium and the culture resumed at 37\u00b0C for 24 hr. Cell viability was assessed by propidium iodide (PI) staining, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) measurement, and the Cell Titer Blue (CTB) assay. Briefly, cells were stained with 10 \u03bcg/ml PI for 10 min at room temperature and then examined by fluorescence microscopy. NeuN-staining or DIC was used to distinguish neurons from glia. For the LDH assay, neurons were washed three times with the external solution and randomly divided into treatment groups. Neurons were washed and incubated in the normal culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 24 hr. The LDH level in the culture medium, indicative of cell death, was measured using the LDH assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Switzerland). An aliquot of the medium (100 \u03bcl) was transferred from the culture wells to the wells of a 96-well plate and mixed with 100 \u03bcl of the reaction solution provided by the kit. Optical density was measured at 492 nm 45 min later using the SpectraMax Paradigm Multimode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Background absorbance at 620 nm was subtracted. The maximal releasable LDH in each well was then obtained by a 15 min incubation with 1% Triton X-100 at the end of each experiment. For the CTB assay, neurons were cultured in the wells of 24-well plates. The amount of culture medium was adjusted to the same in each well (0.5 ml) and pH 6.0 treatment was performed in the absence and presence of different drugs. After a return to normal culture for 24 hr, 0.1 ml CTB solution (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well and the plate incubated for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C.

All reviewers agreed that the manuscript presents an intriguing set of experiments that have been carefully combined to support a highly innovative hypothesis: that ASIC-mediated neuronal death involves a novel form of necroptosis induced by phosphorylation of the kinase RIP1 via an acid and ASIC1-dependent mechanism that does not rely on ASIC ion conduction. However, they added the following cautions: some of the highly innovative ideas presented within this manuscript are based on negative data and experiments that fail to replicate results previously reported by the authors themselves and others. Therefore, the methodology must be clear and all important controls should be reported. Many of these controls are missing and interpretations that would support a less exciting explanation of the results have not been ruled-out. Thus, the major conclusion that the ASIC-dependent neuronal cell death is independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> change and channel conductance, although very appealing, appears to be premature and requires further support."

Of major interest is some resolution of the discrepancy with the previous study of <a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2004</a>. The reviewers agreed that, to be definitive, it will be necessary to characterize the permeability of the mutant, add the calcium imaging data as requested below, repeat the CHO studies in neurons, and utilize additional methodology to assess cell death (since ASICs affect mitochondrial function and the prominent assay used doesn't allow definitive conclusions)."

This is dependent on the number of viable cells as well as mitochondrial metabolism. The authors previously reported that ASIC1a affects mitochondrial activity and cell death (Wang et al., Cell death and Differentiation, 2013). Although no reference to this paper is made within the current manuscript, it seems likely that the interventions could alter mitochondrial localization of ASICs or mitochondrial function to affect the results of the CTB viability assay. A secondary method should be used to rule out non-specific effects due to changes in ASIC localization to the mitochondria (which is not being measured) or pH-dependent changes in mitochondrial activity independent of ASICs."

The authors further imply that the low speed, which induces no detectable Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase, may be closer to the pathophysiological conditions. While I was generally satisfied with the previous version and did not specifically ask for additional measurements, I found the data added in this revision is totally unconvincing. The perfusion was done with focal perfusion using a Y-tube (opening size not specified) placed \u223c500 \u00b5m away from the neuron. The concentration of the perfusion solution (i.e. the pH change) a neuron experiences is determined by the opening and the shape of the tube, and the angle at which the tube is aligned against the neuron. A simple explanation for the lack of Ca<sup>2+</sup> change during slow perfusion could be that the neuron never experienced a significant pH change, and this had little to do with the speed of the pH change. After all, a15 \u00b5l/min perfusion against a dish (1 ml volume?) is very slow and there might be a large pH gradient between the tube opening and the cell body (even for a 500 \u00b5m distance). It's not clear to me why the authors did not use whole-dish perfusion (as done for the CHO cells) where the time it takes to change the whole bath can be more accurately measured/estimated. In summary, it appears to me that the conclusion that Ca<sup>2+</sup> change is speed-dependent is meaningless, unless both the degree and the speed of pH change of bath surrounding the neuron are known."

Therefore, the specific inhibitor of ASIC1a, PcTX1, inhibited extracellular acidosis-induced neuronal necroptosis (please see new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2B</a>), but not H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced neuronal death because of the inaccessibility of extracellularly applied PcTX1 to mtASIC1a located in mitochondrial inner membrane (please see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> in the paper by <a href=\"#bib42\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Nevertheless, to rule out non-specific effects due to potential changes in ASIC localization to the mitochondria acidic neuronal death was also assayed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and counting PI-positive neurons (please see new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C1 and C2</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>; and <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 5</a>).

The authors should report ASIC1a-dependent calcium signal in neurons treated with Nec-1 and in neurons transfected with the different ASIC1a constructs used in the death assays. The authors now show that acid-induced calcium signaling is absent in transfected CHO cells (this has been previously reported by Samways et al., as stated by the authors) and that acid-induced cell death occurs in the absence of extracellular calcium in neurons. Yet, as the authors eloquently discuss, calcium permeability and acid-induced calcium fluctuations have been the focus of the field for years. The irrelevance of calcium is such a significant reversal of previous data published by the authors as well as almost all reviews of ASIC1a-dependent processes. This assertion should be backed by all commonly available methodologies. As the authors have previously reported imaging of ASIC1a-induced calcium signals in neurons (Gao et al., Neuron, 2005), these measures of calcium are conspicuously absent. Given the importance of these results for the field, they should also be included.</i>"

Inclusion of a cocktail of blockers for ionotropic glutamate receptors and voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>channels suppressed the acid-evoked response by about 50% and the remaining response was largely inhibited by PcTX1 (50 nM). Together with the lack of acid-evoked changes in Fura-2 ratio in ASIC1a-KO neurons under the same conditions, these results indicate that the native ASIC1a channels in mouse neurons mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the acid-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are further amplified through other channels, such as voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and glutamate receptors. We further demonstrated that transient transfection of WT or RC-ASIC1a, but not HIF-ASIC1a, restored acid-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in ASIC1a-KO neurons, consistent with the electrophysiological measurement of acid-induced currents in CHO cells for these constructs for their \u201cchannel functionality\u201d."

This perhaps is not too surprising because it has long been recognized that fast solution exchange is necessary in order to elicit the transient proton-evoked ASIC currents typically seen in the literatures. If the acidic solution was applied slowly, especially with whole chamber solution exchange, the currents either failed to develop or became shallow and small. This is entirely consistent with the rapid desensitization property of these channels as only when the majority of channels in the entire cell open simultaneously can robust currents develop. We reasoned that for acid-induced cell demise, neither the solution exchange in the experimental setting nor the manifestation of tissue acidosis needed to occur fast or in a synchronous fashion throughout the entire cells. Therefore, the strict conditions required to elicit acid-evoked whole-cell currents and the consequent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rise are not exactly compatible with that of acid-induced death. Indeed, when the pH 6.0 solution was applied at a slower rate (\u223c15 \u00b5l/min) to neurons, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rise became very shallow or nearly undetectable (new <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2B5 and 2B6</a>).Therefore, although WT ASIC1a channels indeed mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in neurons, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals arising from these channels are likely to be very small in response to the development of tissue acidosis. Given that the non-conducting HIF-ASIC1a mutant mediated acid-induced death without generating any Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in neurons even with the fast solution exchange (new <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2B3</a>), we argue that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, no matter big or small, are not needed for the acid-induced neuronal death.

At a slower perfusion rate, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response became very small or negligible. For cell death experiments, we washed the cells twice with the acidic solution in order to ensure a complete solution exchange in the dish (or well). Therefore, the rate of acid application was slow. We believe that tissue acidosis also occur slowly in the ischemic/reperfused brain. Therefore, the conditions required to observe robust acid-induced ASIC currents and the consequent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rise are not compatible with that for acid to induce neuronal death. The previous conclusion ion channel conductance and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of ASIC1a-mediated cell death were pretty much based on correlative data, which do not unequivocally prove the involvement of channel function per se in the induction of neuronal death.

The authors further imply that the low speed, which induces no detectable Ca</i><sup><i>2+</i></sup> <i>increase, may be closer to the pathophysiological conditions. While I was generally satisfied with the previous version and did not specifically ask for additional measurements, I found the data added in this revision is totally unconvincing. The perfusion was done with focal perfusion using a Y-tube (opening size not specified) placed \u223c 500 \u00b5m away from the neuron. The concentration of the perfusion solution (i.e. the pH change) a neuron experiences is determined by the opening and the shape of the tube, and the angle at which the tube is aligned against the neuron. A simple explanation for the lack of Ca</i><sup><i>2+</i></sup> <i>change during slow perfusion could be that the neuron never experienced a significant pH change, and this had little to do with the speed of the pH change. After all, a15 \u00b5l/min perfusion against a dish (1 ml volume?) is very slow and there might be a large pH gradient between the tube opening and the cell body (even for a 500 \u00b5m distance). It's not clear to me why the authors did not use whole-dish perfusion (as done for the CHO cells) where the time it takes to change the whole bath can be more accurately measured/estimated. In summary, it appears to me that the conclusion that Ca</i><sup><i>2+</i></sup> <i>change is speed-dependent is meaningless, unless both the degree and the speed of pH change of bath surrounding the neuron are known.</i>"

We show that in whole-cell recordings the proton-activated TRPV1 currents (either by pH 6.0 or pH 5.0) were not affected by the perfusion rate whereas the development of ASIC1a current (by pH 6.0) was severely hampered by the slow perfusion rate (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 3</a>). These results demonstrate that in our system, the cells under study were in fact exposed equally to the acidic solution with both fast- and slow-flow rates and the differences observed between the fast and slow perfusion for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and current responses of ASIC1a were due to the fast desensitization of this channel."

Although ASICs do not desensitize as fast as the AMPA receptors, we still routinely observe a delay and a strong suppression of the acid-induced ASIC current in whole chamber perfusion as well as focal perfusion at relatively slow flow rates. Therefore, just like the AMPA receptors, the proton-evoked ASIC currents can only be reliably recorded if the low pH solution was applied quickly to the cell. The Y-tube apparatus has allowed us to achieve this goal in imaging and electrophysiological assays in the past 20 years. The open end of the Y-tube has an inner diameter of \u223c100 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a>). Therefore, even though the values for flow rates (15 \u00b5l/min and 50 \u00b5l/min, adjusted by changing the height of the solution reservoir) appear to be small as compared to those typically reported for whole-chamber perfusion in the literatures, the distances and areas covered by the perfused solution can be quite far (\u223c30 mm/sec if the solution maintains a perfect cylindrical shape or at least 2 mm in diameter after 20 sec of continued perfusion if the solution merely dribbles out from the apparatus). Even with the most conserved estimate, if the 5 \u03bcl acid solution resulting from 20 sec application at the rate of 15 \u00b5l/min forms a perfect sphere, it would still occupy a space with a radius of 1080 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a>, based on the formula (4/3)<math id=\"inf1\"><mi>\u03c0</mi></math> r<sup>3</sup>), which is approximately 2 mm in diameter. This distance should be sufficient to cover the cells situated about 500 \u03bcm (0.5 mm) away from the tip of the Y-tube (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a>). In reality, the perfused solution most likely forms a cone-shaped stream rather than a sphere and the areas it covers are likely much bigger than the above estimate. Therefore, a 500 \u03bcm distance from the tip of the Y-tube is both sufficient for the solution to reach to the cell and ideal for avoiding any flush-induced cell shape distortion."
