Paired recordings and multiple probability fluctuation analysis revealed similar quantal sizes, but 4-times more functional release sites in human pyramidal cell to fast-spiking interneuron connections compared to rats. These connections were mediated on average by three synaptic contacts in both species. Each presynaptic active zone (AZ) contains 6.2 release sites in human, but only 1.6 in rats. Electron microscopy (EM) and EM tomography showed that an AZ harbors 4 docked vesicles in human, but only a single one in rats. Consequently, a Katz\u2019s functional release site occupies ~0.012 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> in the human presynaptic AZ and ~0.025 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> in the rat. Our results reveal a robust difference in the biophysical properties of a well-defined synaptic connection of the cortical microcircuit of human and rodents."

Paired recordings and multiple probability fluctuation analysis revealed similar quantal sizes, but 4-times more functional release sites in human pyramidal cell to fast-spiking interneuron connections compared to rats. These connections were mediated on average by three synaptic contacts in both species. Each presynaptic active zone (AZ) contains 6.2 release sites in human, but only 1.6 in rats. Electron microscopy (EM) and EM tomography showed that an AZ harbors 4 docked vesicles in human, but only a single one in rats. Consequently, a Katz\u2019s functional release site occupies ~0.012 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> in the human presynaptic AZ and ~0.025 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> in the rat. Our results reveal a robust difference in the biophysical properties of a well-defined synaptic connection of the cortical microcircuit of human and rodents."

The layered architecture, cellular elements and synaptic connectivity of the human neocortex have been investigated and compared to those of other mammals such as primates, carnivores, and rodents (<a href=\"#bib14\">Komlosi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Mohan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Molnar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Olah et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Prince and Wong, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Schwartzkroin and Knowles, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Verhoog et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yanez et al., 2005</a>). Although, there are species-specific differences in the layering, long-range connections and intrinsic electrical and morphological properties of nerve cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mohan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wang et al., 2015</a>), the cellular elements and local synaptic circuits were found to be rather stereotyped. For example, similar types of cortical GABAergic interneurons (INs), pyramidal cells (PCs) and comparable local synaptic connectivity patterns were reported in rodent and human neocortices (<a href=\"#bib20\">Molnar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Olah et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yanez et al., 2005</a>). However, classic theories suggest that synaptic properties also contribute to cognitive abilities (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bliss and Lomo, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Buzsaki, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Hebb, 1949</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Singer, 1995</a>) and recent studies revealed differences in synaptic communication between cell types that are highly conserved among mammals. Human cortical PC to PC connections display spike timing-dependent long-term plasticity similar to that found in rodents, but with altered plasticity-inducing activity patterns (<a href=\"#bib40\">Verhoog et al., 2013</a>). It has also been demonstrated that the outputs of human PCs can be so powerful that individual presynaptic action potentials result in suprathreshold postsynaptic responses in GABAergic neurons and polysynaptic series of events downstream in the network (<a href=\"#bib14\">Komlosi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Molnar et al., 2008</a>). These powerful PC to IN connections are not characteristic to nonhuman tissue and were speculated to be important in reliable propagation of information in the human neocortex (<a href=\"#bib43\">Woodruff and Yuste, 2008</a>). Here we aimed at determining set out to determine whether underlying biophysical properties and structural features of these connections are different in our species compared to one of the most widely used rodent model organisms, the rat."

Acute brain slices were prepared from small blocks of non-pathological samples of human cortical tissue resected in surgery from female (n = 15, aged 53 \u00b1 13 years) and male (n = 11, aged 43 \u00b1 24 years) patients (<a href=\"#bib14\">Komlosi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Molnar et al., 2008</a>), from somatosensory cortex of juvenile (P18 - 28, n = 9) and prefrontal cortex of adult (P53 - 65, n = 17) male rats using standard acute slice preparation procedures (<a href=\"#bib23\">Olah et al., 2007</a>). Both presynaptic PCs and postsynaptic INs were whole-cell recorded with biocytin-containing intracellular solutions, allowing <i>post hoc</i> identification of the recorded cell types and the number of synaptic contacts between them. Neurons were chosen based on their typical membrane and firing properties. Postsynaptic INs were identified as either axo-axonic (AACs, human: n = 6) or basket (BCs, human: n = 18; rat: n = 8) cells based on their characteristic axonal cartridges or axonal branches forming perisomatic baskets, respectively (<a href=\"#bib13\">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and F</a>). Reconstructions allowed the measurement of the length of dendritic (BCs, n = 9, 2912 \u00b1 1076 \u00b5m; AACs, n = 5, 2897 \u00b1 1546 \u00b5m, p = 1, MW U-test) and axonal (BCs, n = 7, 27,489 \u00b1 14,080 \u00b5m; AACs, n = 5, 20732 \u00b1 3332 \u00b5m, p = 0.41) arbors within our human slices. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), recorded from INs in response to single presynaptic action potentials showed a wide range of amplitudes in both species (human: 9.0\u20131477.1\u2009pA; rat: 7.7\u2013236.3\u2009pA), with a significantly larger mean amplitude in human INs (human: 258.8 \u00b1 272.8\u2009pA; rat: 75.8 \u00b1 58.7\u2009pA; p&lt;0.001, MW U-test, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and G</a>). Unitary EPSCs in human and rats had similar latencies (human: 1.04 \u00b1 0.4 ms, n= 37; rat: 1.1 \u00b1 0.38 ms, n = 25; p = 0.79, MW U-test), rise (10\u201390%, human: 0.44 \u00b1 0.16 ms, n = 39; rat: 0.43 \u00b1 0.14 ms; n = 26; p = 0.95, MW U-test) and decay (37%, human: 1.46 \u00b1 0.83 ms, n = 38; rat: 1.7 \u00b1 0.8 ms, n = 26; P = 0.18, MW U-test) times and the larger amplitude with similar decay resulted in a significantly larger EPSC charge in human (human: 553.6 \u00b1 593.3 fC, n=38; rat: 123.1 \u00b1 107.6 fC, n = 26; p&lt;0.001, MW U-test; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>)."

To assess the number of putative synaptic contacts, team members without access to the <i>N<sub>frs</sub> </i>searched for close appositions of presynaptic axon terminals and postsynaptic dendrites under light microscopy (LM). The presynaptic axon from the parent PC soma to the target IN dendrites were reconstructed in nine human (n = 2 PC to AAC and n = 7 PC to BC pairs, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and fifteen rat (n = 15 PC to BC pairs, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>) pairs that partially overlapped with MPFA analyzed cell pairs. Comparison of the number of LM detected synaptic contacts (<i>N<sub>lm</sub></i>) between human (3.3 \u00b1 1.5; range: 1\u20136) and rat (2.9 \u00b1 1.5, range: 1\u20136) revealed no significant difference (p = 0.35, MW U-test, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Consequently, dividing the mean <i>N<sub>frs</sub> </i>with the mean <i>N<sub>lm</sub> </i>indicated that each presynaptic bouton contains on average 6.2 and 1.6 functional release sites in human and rat, respectively. This ratio was also larger for human connections when calculated from those pairs for which both MPFA and LM reconstructions could be performed (human: <i>N<sub>frs</sub>/N<sub>lm\u00a0</sub></i>= 5.7 \u00b1 5.1, range 1.6\u201313.3, n = 4; rat: <i>N<sub>frs</sub>/N<sub>lm\u00a0</sub></i>= 2.6, n = 1). These results demonstrate that differences in the number of synaptic junctions between PCs and fast-spiking INs is not responsible for the observed 4.4-fold larger <i>N<sub>frs</sub></i>, therefore each presynaptic PC axon terminal must contain a larger <i>N<sub>frs</sub> </i>in human."

We performed three-dimensional reconstructions of presynaptic axon terminals from 20 nm thick serial EM sections (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Biocytin-filled, <i>post hoc</i> recovered human (n = 3) and rat (n = 3) INs were chosen and axon terminals that established asymmetrical synaptic contacts on selected dendrites (see Supplementary Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) were fully reconstructed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C,H,J</a>). First we compared the size of presynaptic AZs and found that both human and rat active zones (AZs) have variable sizes (human: 0.02\u20130.26 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>; rat: 0.02\u20130.08 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>), but the human AZs were on average twice as large (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3P</a>). Each bouton contained only a single AZ in both species. When we counted docked vesicles in these AZs using the 20 nm thin serial section approach we found a significantly larger number in human (4.2 \u00b1 2.2 / AZ) compared to rats (1.3 \u00b1 0.8 / AZ; p&lt;0.001, MW U-test; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Q</a>), resulting in a twice as large docked vesicle density in human (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3R</a>). However, as the precise identification of docked vesicles is challenging in conventional EM even if very thin (20 nm) sections are used, we repeated these measurements using EM tomography; the best currently known method for this application (<a href=\"#bib11\">Imig et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Siksou et al., 2007</a>). Analysis of EM tomograms in 3 human (n = 33 synapses) and 3 rat (n = 31 synapses) samples revealed a similar two-fold difference in the mean docked vesicle density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3R</a>). These results confirmed that reconstructions from very thin serial EM sections also provide a reliable measure of the number of docked vesicles. The large variability in the AZ area and number of docked vesicle prompted us to investigate their relationship and found a positive correlation between these parameters in both species (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3S</a>; human: \u03c1 = 0.71; rat: \u03c1= 0.54, Spearman correlation). Moreover, the docked vesicle density and the size of the proximal vesicle pool normalized to the AZ area in axon terminals (n = 15 from both species, for definition see Methods) showed no significant correlation both in human (\u03c1 = 0.15, P = 0.59, Spearman correlation), and rat samples (\u03c1 = \u22120.09, p = 0.76; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Our data allowed us to provide the first estimate of the size of Katz\u2019s functional release site (<a href=\"#bib6\">del Castillo and Katz, 1954</a>) of cortical synapses; approximately 0.012 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> AZ membrane area in human and 0.025 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> in rats. Thus, the space that harbors a functional release site or a docking site seems to be substantially smaller in human AZs.

Answering this question requires quantitative proteomic analysis of these AZs at nanometer resolutions.

Even if upscaling of release components simply follows larger neurons and synapses in the human microcircuit, it is important to note that scalability of multivesicular release in human synapses as opposed to all-or-none single vesicular rat synapses provides additional functional variability, which might subserve evolutionary optimization. The strong connections linking pyramidal cells and a select group of postsynaptic neurons in the same area of the neocortex could be strategically positioned for the emergence and maintenance of key cortical hubs characteristic of the human cerebral cortex (<a href=\"#bib8\">Haggmann et al. 2008</a>).

Human slices were derived from material that had to be removed to gain access for the surgical treatment of deep-brain tumors from the left and right frontal (n\u00a0=\u00a022), temporal (n\u00a0=\u00a014), and parietal (n\u00a0=\u00a03) regions with written informed consent of female (n\u00a0=\u00a015, aged 53 \u00b1 13 years) and male (n\u00a0=\u00a011, aged 43 \u00b1 24 years) patients prior to surgery. We found no significant differences between EPSC charge values between experiments performed in slices prepared from frontal and temporal lobes (425.8 \u00b1 426.7 vs. 760.6 \u00b1 761.2, p = 0.1, MW U-test) and between morphologically identified basket and axo-axonic cell groups (567.5 \u00b1 451.6 vs. 364.9 \u00b1 193.3, p = 0.36, MW U-test). Furthermore, we found no significant differences in EPSC parameters measured in female and male patients (charge, female: 602.49 \u00b1 480.81 fC, male: 499.27 \u00b1 708.32 fC,p\u00a0=0.13; rise time, female: 0.46 \u00b1 0.20 ms, male: 0.42 \u00b1 0.13 ms, p = 0.71; decay time, female:1.32 \u00b1 0.56 ms, male:1.63 \u00b1 1.04, p\u00a0= 0.65, latency female:1.08 \u00b1 0.46 ms, male: 0.99 \u00b1 0.37 ms, p = 0.7, MW U-test). In addition, we found no correlation between the age of patients and the charge (\u03c1 = 0.05, p = 0.76), rise time (\u03c1 = 0, p = 0.99), latency (\u03c1 = 0.16, p = 0.32) and decay (\u03c1 = 0.01, P = 0.94) of the measured EPSCs (Spearman correlation, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Anesthesia was induced with intravenous midazolam and fentanyl (0.03 mg/kg, 1\u20132 \u00b5g/kg, respectively). A bolus dose of propofol (1\u20132 mg/kg) was administered intravenously. To facilitate endotracheal intubation, the patient received 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium. After 120\u2009s, the trachea was intubated and the patient was ventilated with a mixture of O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O at a ratio of 1:2. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevo\ufb02urane at monitored anaesthesia care (MAC) volume of 1.2\u20131.5. After surgical removing blocks of tissue were immersed immediately in ice-cold solution containing (in mM) 130 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 d(+)-glucose, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices were cut perpendicular to cortical layers at a thickness of 350\u2009\u03bcm with a vibrating blade microtome (Microm HM 650 V) and were incubated at room temperature for 1\u2009hr in the same solution. The solution used during recordings was similar to the slicing solution, but it contained 3\u2009mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1.5\u2009mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>. Coronal slices (350\u2009\u03bcm) were prepared from the somatosensory cortex of male Wistar rats (P18\u2013P28, n = 9, RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_2312511\">RGD_2312511</a>) and medial prefrontal cortex of adult male Wistar rats (P53\u201365, n = 17) as described previously (<a href=\"#bib19\">Molnar et al., 2014</a>). We found no significant differences in EPSC charge values between the two rodent groups (81.6 \u00b1 59.3 vs. 72.7 \u00b1 60.0, p = 0.91, MW U-test). We calculated the relative age of rats involved in the study referenced to human age taking into account that 3.3 rat days equals one human year around sexual maturity (P38 in rats and 12 years in human, <a href=\"#bib33\">Sengupta, 2013</a>). Thus, the age range of rats used in our experiments corresponds to approximately 6\u201320 years in humans. Recordings were performed at 36\u00b0C. Cells were visualized through water-immersion 40\u00d7 objective using infrared differential interference contrast videomicroscopy at depths 60\u2013130\u2009\u03bcm from the surface of the slice. Micropipettes (3.5\u20135 M\u2126) were filled with two types of low [Cl]<sub>i</sub> intracellular solution for whole-cell patch-clamp recording: (in mM): 126\u2009K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP-Na<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine, and 8 biocytin (pH 7.20; 300 mOsm), of the postsynaptic INs and 116\u2009K-gluconate, 10\u2009L-glutamic acid, 4 KCl, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP-Na<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine, and 8 biocytin (pH 7.20; 300 mOsm) for presynaptic PCs. Membrane currents were recorded with a dual-channel amplifier an EPC 10 quadro amplifier (HEKA) filtered at 7 or 8 kHz (Bessel filter), digitized at 50\u2013100 kHz, and analyzed with PULSE software. Series resistance (Rs) and whole-cell capacitance was checked continuously in the postsynaptic IN. The mean Rs for the first analyzed epochs during the recordings was 19.7 \u00b1 6.9 M\u2126 and after 66\u201373% compensation it was 6.0 \u00b1 2.2 M\u2126. The experiment was discarded if the compensated Rs change reached 20% during the recording. We performed multiple probability fluctuation analysis (MPFA) by altering [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> in three to five different conditions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Biro et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Silver, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Silver et al., 1998</a>) from lower to higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations adding the following substances to the recording ACSF: 20\u2009\u03bcM DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5) (Tocris), 10\u2009\u03bcM 1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl-N-1-piperidinyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM251) (Sigma-Aldrich,\u00a0St. Louis, MO), 0.5\u2009mM \u03b3-D-glutamylglycine (\u03b3DGG) (Abcam). PCs were stimulated with brief (3\u201315 ms) current pulses (+ 850\u2009pA) delivered at 5\u2009s intervals, the postsynaptic membrane potential was held at \u221270 mV. The stability of peak amplitudes or charge values in time throughout an epoch (73 and 78 events on average in each epoch in human and rat, respectively) was determined by running average and by checking fulfillment of slope &lt;0.05 relation of the fitted a regression line to the scatter plot of EPSC charge vs. time. Elapsed time from tissue removal until the start of MPFA experiments was 9.8 \u00b1 4.1 and 5.3 \u00b1 1.8\u2009hr in the human and rat, respectively. In order to exclude unwanted decrease of EPSC amplitudes during long recordings, we performed control experiments on pyramidal cell to basket cell pairs (n = 5). During these experiments we used the same configuration to assess possible rundown effects. We made at least 50 min-long recordings (up to 90 min) with inter-event intervals of 5 s. We found no significant decrease in the amplitude or charge between epochs selected from the first and last part of recordings (50 traces, charge: p\u22650.41; amplitude: p\u22650.21, unpaired t-test)."

Dendritic segments (distance from the soma ~50\u2009\u03bcm in rat and ~150\u2009\u03bcm in human) of biocytin filled basket cells (identified based on distinctive electrophysiological properties and LM investigation of the axonal arbor) were re-embedded and re-sectioned at 20 nm thickness.

Active zones were identified by the parallel rigid membrane appositions where the synaptic cleft widened (because the PSD is masked by the dark DAB precipitate). Potential inhibitory synapses with flattened vesicles were discarded from the analysis. Bouton volumes of a subpopulation of boutons were measured from 20 nm serial reconstructions where the series contained the whole terminal (n = 9 human boutons, n = 8 rat boutons). We calculated the volume of the same subset of boutons from the area of the largest cross-section (assuming that boutons are spherical) and found a tight correlation (\u03c1 = 0.9019, Spearman correlation) with the measured volume. Based on this correlation, we calculated the volume from the largest cross-section of those terminals where the AZ was measured, but the series did not contain the whole terminal."

The main finding of the study is that at human synapses EPSCs have larger mean amplitudes mediated by a higher number of release sites in comparison to those in the rat. This functional difference correlates well with the divergent number of docked vesicles at presynaptic active zones in the two species. The work was judged by both reviewers as excellent. The results are of high quality, well-presented and the conclusions are supported by the data. The results provide important insights into how synapses operate in the human cortex and what differences may underlie the superior performance of human circuits despite the general similarities in terms of anatomical and physiological properties of neocortical synapses, cells and networks across various mammalian species."
