The processes that modulate SOX2 activity to promote pluripotency are not well understood. Here, we show SOX2 is <i>O</i>-GlcNAc modified in its transactivation domain during reprogramming and in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Upon induction of differentiation SOX2 <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation at serine 248 is decreased. Replacing wild type with an <i>O</i>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 (S248A) increases reprogramming efficiency. ESCs with <i>O</i>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 exhibit alterations in gene expression. This change correlates with altered protein-protein interactions and genomic occupancy of the <i>O</i>-GlcNAc-deficient SOX2 compared to wild type. In addition, SOX2 <i>O</i>-GlcNAcylation impairs the SOX2-PARP1 interaction, which has been shown to regulate ESC self-renewal. These findings show that SOX2 activity is modulated by <i>O</i>-GlcNAc modification, and provide a novel regulatory mechanism for this crucial pluripotency transcription factor."
