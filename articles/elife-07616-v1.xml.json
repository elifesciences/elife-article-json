Here, we take advantage of a combination of large environmental data sets on <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> (<i>MU</i>), an environmentally persistent microorganism associated to freshwater ecosystems and present in a large variety of aquatic hosts, to characterize abiotic and biotic factors driving the dynamics of this pathogen in two regions of Cameroon. We find that <i>MU</i> dynamics are largely driven by seasonal climatic factors and certain physico-chemical conditions in stagnant and slow-flowing ecosystems, with an important role of <i>pH</i> as limiting factor. Furthermore, water conditions can modify the effect of abundance and diversity of aquatic organisms on <i>MU</i> dynamics, which suggests a different contribution of two <i>MU</i> transmission routes for aquatic hosts (trophic vs environmental transmission) depending on local abiotic factors."

Here, we take advantage of a combination of large environmental data sets on <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> (<i>MU</i>), an environmentally persistent microorganism associated to freshwater ecosystems and present in a large variety of aquatic hosts, to characterize abiotic and biotic factors driving the dynamics of this pathogen in two regions of Cameroon. We find that <i>MU</i> dynamics are largely driven by seasonal climatic factors and certain physico-chemical conditions in stagnant and slow-flowing ecosystems, with an important role of <i>pH</i> as limiting factor. Furthermore, water conditions can modify the effect of abundance and diversity of aquatic organisms on <i>MU</i> dynamics, which suggests a different contribution of two <i>MU</i> transmission routes for aquatic hosts (trophic vs environmental transmission) depending on local abiotic factors."

In this region, the bacteria are also generally present in waters that are more alkaline and contain fewer animals, especially from certain species that could prevent the infection spreading to other aquatic hosts. In the other region, dominated by a savannah landscape, the bacteria are most abundant in stagnant or slowly moving waters that have optimal physical and chemical conditions and contain many diverse species of potential animal hosts. The discovery of contrasting results for the two regions suggests that there are at least two ways that <i>M. ulcerans</i> can persist in the environment and infect the aquatic animals.

Most emerging pathogens are zoonotic and have a very broad range of hosts (<a href=\"#bib49\">Woolhouse et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005</a>), and as a result, host\u2013parasite interactions are often embedded within complex host communities (<a href=\"#bib37\">Plowright et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Roche et al., 2013b</a>). Biotic interactions between hosts in the community may play an important role on disease transmission, either promoting or diluting the overall prevalence of the pathogen (<a href=\"#bib21\">LoGiudice et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Keesing et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Johnson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Roche et al., 2013a</a>). In addition, the effect of seasonal variations in climate on abiotic conditions in water and soil can influence the composition of host communities and in turn have an impact on the ecological dynamics of the pathogens (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ostfeld et al., 2008</a>). Because of the intertwined nature of biotic and abiotic drivers, disentangling their respective contribution to pathogen dynamics and transmission through complex and different-scale processes remains a challenge (<a href=\"#bib37\">Plowright et al., 2008</a>). Nonetheless, identifying the underlying ecological mechanisms driving the emergence and persistence of diseases is essential to reduce disease risk in human populations (<a href=\"#bib41a\">Roche and Gu\u00e9gan, 2011</a>)."

From a public health perspective, <i>MU</i> is the agent responsible for Buruli ulcer (BU), a devastating skin disease with great health and socio-economic consequences in tropical and subtropical countries (<a href=\"#bib47\">WHO, 2008</a>). Emergence, distribution, and risk factors for BU in many parts of the world are associated with stagnant and slow-flowing ecosystems (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wagner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Jacobsen and Padgett, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Marion et al., 2011</a>). The environmental factors that favour <i>MU</i> persistence and transmission within these ecosystems are still poorly understood but the environmental and multi-host nature of the pathogen suggests that its environmental dynamics can be the result of a complex interplay between environmental factors and biotic interactions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Garchitorena et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Morris et al., 2014</a>)."

Biotic interactions between hosts are thought to be a pathogen transmission route between organisms (<a href=\"#bib31\">Merritt et al., 2010</a>), with <i>MU</i> being integrated in the aquatic community from the environment thanks to filter feeder, herbivorous, and scavenger organisms and then transmitted across the community through predation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Marsollier et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">2007a</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mosi et al., 2008</a>). As a result, community-level factors such as biodiversity or abundance of aquatic organisms could drive the environmental load of <i>MU</i> through amplification or dilution effects, as demonstrated for other pathogens (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ezenwa et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Suz\u00e1n et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Keesing et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Johnson et al., 2013</a>).

Many of these conditions are generally met in swamps and other stagnant and slow-flowing ecosystems, and therefore, if optimal abiotic conditions are met, <i>MU</i> could grow and persist in these ecosystems as free-living stages in the water and infect aquatic organisms directly, without the need for a trophic transmission to take place. Besides, numerous abiotic factors within aquatic ecosystems can influence host community structures and assemblages (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eric Benbow et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Garchitorena et al., 2014</a>), since aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate taxa have different ranges of optimal water conditions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dickens and Graham, 2002</a>).

Identifying the contribution of such transmission routes requires a deep understanding of the dynamics of <i>MU</i> within aquatic communities through space and time. A recent characterization of <i>MU</i> dynamics with unprecedented detail in two BU endemic areas with very distinct environmental conditions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Garchitorena et al., 2014</a>) offers the variability needed to address this question. Indeed, in Bankim, a region located in a transition zone between forest and savannah, swamps had remarkably higher <i>MU</i> positivity, as initially expected, whereas in Akonolinga, where rainforest is the prevailing landscape, all ecosystems had similar <i>MU</i> positivity. These regional differences suggested that savannah swamps had unique favourable conditions for <i>MU</i> that were not found elsewhere, but <i>MU</i> was still able to persist in unfavourable environments. Furthermore, temporal fluctuations in <i>MU</i> presence in Akonolinga suggested a potential role of seasonal climatic events as drivers of <i>MU</i> dynamics."

Insights into the ecological mechanisms allowing for <i>MU</i> growth and persistence over space and time, while accounting for the potential impact of seasonal climatic events, may have profound implications for understanding BU risk to human populations."

We use cutting-edge multi-model selection procedures and information theory to identify and quantify the most important predictors of <i>MU</i> dynamics, using a genetic algorithm to screen multiple models from all potential combinations of explanatory variables and making inference from a set of weighted best-performing models. In addition, we back the results of this novel approach, which deals with the uncertainty associated with model selection, by comparing them to those obtained by classical model selection procedures.

In a previous step to the statistical modelling of <i>MU</i> positivity, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) of the most relevant physico-chemical characteristics in the water, as a means to explore common patterns in the ecosystems and to include these PCs as alternative abiotic predictors in the model. The ecosystems sampled and followed up in both Akonolinga and Bankim regions consistently revealed common physico-chemical patterns depending on water flow (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The first PC, explaining about 50% of variation in aquatic ecosystems in both regions, showed a positive correlation between water flow, dissolved oxygen, and <i>pH</i>, while temperature was inversely correlated. Furthermore, the inverse correlation between temperature and water flow held in the second PC, and the positive correlation between water flow and oxygen was also present in the third PC. Using multi-model selection for our GLMMs, a combination of seasonal factors, water conditions (abiotic factors), and community-level characteristics (biotic factors) remained as important predictors of <i>MU</i> positivity in the final set of best models for Akonolinga (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) and Bankim (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Among all possible models tested, 39 were selected for estimation of model average estimates in Akonolinga and 100 in Bankim, since these models were similarly performing according to their Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) scores (see the methodology section). Although all factors were included together as part of the full model, the results explained below are divided in groups of factors for clarity.

In this study, we identify abiotic and biotic drivers that may promote or block <i>MU</i> transmission in aquatic communities in two climatically distinct regions of Cameroon through a comprehensive multi-model selection procedure. In Akonolinga, we show that <i>MU</i> follows seasonal dynamics and is mainly present in waters with higher <i>pH</i> and within low abundance communities, notably those with low abundance of Gastropoda and other orders such as Decapoda, Hemiptera, or Anura.

This suggests that seasonal fluctuations in <i>MU</i> presence might be directly related to climatic pressures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Indeed, while the seasonal effect is not directly linked to rainfall dynamics (Pearson's correlation test, p = 0.45), it is highly correlated with the 3-month mean rainfall accumulation in the region (Current month, plus two previous months; Pearson's correlation test, p &lt; 0.01). As a result, we propose that the cumulative effect of rainfall over several months, increasing water levels in the environment either boosts <i>MU</i> growth or washes it off from other environmental matrices (mud, soil, plants) to aquatic ecosystems, as previously suggested from epidemiological evidence (<a href=\"#bib32\">Morris et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, given the slow growth of <i>MU</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Palomino and Portaels, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Stinear et al., 2007</a>), the 2-month delay between the peaks in the dynamics of rainfall and those of the seasonal effect could represent the time that takes <i>MU</i> to grow and/or be transmitted through the aquatic community once the suitable habitats have been created. Unfortunately, the less frequent sampling in Bankim (only 4 months instead of 12) may have prevented to capture seasonal variations appropriately, explaining the lack of associations with <i>MU</i> in this region."

Less abundant communities are associated with a reduction of <i>MU</i> in this region, and individual taxa have an independent effect on <i>MU</i>. Higher relative abundance of aquatic snails (Gastropoda), shrimps (Decapoda), water bugs (Hemiptera), and tadpoles (Anura) is associated with reduced <i>MU</i> prevalence in the aquatic community. The protective role of aquatic snails is supported by experimental infections, where <i>MU</i> has been unable to grow within these organisms (<a href=\"#bib28\">Marsollier and S\u00e9v\u00e9rin, 2004</a>), but this is not the case for Hemipteran water bugs, where <i>MU</i> can grow and even colonize their salivary glands after they have fed on infected prey (<a href=\"#bib27\">Marsollier et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mosi et al., 2008</a>). Even though water bugs can host <i>MU</i> and allow its growth, they are voracious predators of aquatic organisms, and therefore, an increase in water bugs in the community may result in a decrease of infected prey available to other predators such as Coleoptera or Odonata; this could result in an overall reduction in <i>MU</i> positivity. This is an example of how considering the full breadth of factors taking place in real ecological systems can provide unexpected insights on this type of host\u2013pathogen interactions. Furthermore, differences in community composition may partly explain the different effects of biotic factors in the two regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>). Total abundance in aquatic communities was significantly higher in Akonolinga (Mann\u2013Whitney test, p &lt; 0.001), and the relative abundance of more than half of the taxa included in our model was significantly different between Akonolinga and Bankim (<a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>, section 2)."

Indeed, two transmission routes, not competitively exclusive, may coexist for <i>MU</i> colonization of aquatic organisms, through a trophic transmission (<a href=\"#bib40\">Roche et al., 2013a</a>) and/or a pathogen transmission through infection with free-living stages present in favourable aquatic environments (<a href=\"#bib31\">Merritt et al., 2010</a>). In our study, community abundance has opposite effects in Akonolinga and Bankim, while water flow and <i>pH</i> suggest contrasted influence of stagnant waters in these regions. These results could suggest that the prevailing transmission modes could be different within these two environmentally distinct regions. Transmission could be mainly environmentally mediated in Bankim, since stagnant waters, through weak water flows and optimal physico-chemical conditions, are strongly associated with <i>MU</i> presence. Furthermore, a lack of association of <i>MU</i> abundance with specific taxa in addition to strong positive associations with host diversity and abundance under these favourable conditions, suggests that infection probability in these environments is density dependent, a characteristic feature of this type of transmission (<a href=\"#bib7\">Code\u00e7o, 2001</a>). Conversely, in Akonolinga, trophic transmission may be expected since optimal abiotic conditions are not met in stagnant ecosystems, and host abundance has a negative impact on <i>MU</i> presence, suggesting that presence of some taxa, at least Gastropoda and Hemiptera, can limit transmission in aquatic communities. These alternative transmission routes proposed for <i>MU</i> to persist and thrive in aquatic ecosystems could partly explain why BU distribution in humans is greatly associated with stagnant ecosystems but expands over larger geographical regions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wagner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Jacobsen and Padgett, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Marion et al., 2011</a>)."

This study provides a new illustration of emerging infectious diseases for which further investigations looking for a \u2018bigger picture\u2019 are clearly needed in order to cope with the complexity of local and regional environmental situations, and different-scale processes. Judging by the number and importance of multi-host and environmentally persistent pathogens in the total number of emerging infectious diseases appeared in the last four decades such hypotheses deserve to be rigorously tested across multiple epidemiological systems and diverse local conditions. More comprehensive environmental studies in other contexts are needed to assess the generalizability of our findings."

This approach allows exploring a comprehensive set of potential models obtained as a result of multiple combinations of the explanatory variables. Instead of considering a unique final model, as is the case in classical forward, backward, or stepwise model selection procedures, with multi-model selection, it is possible to identify a set of \u2018top models\u2019 that can be ranked and weighted according to information criteria such as AIC. Model averaging within this set of top models provides quantitative measures of each variable's relative importance (Akaike Weights, <i>w</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>) and allows obtaining robust parameter estimates and addressing the uncertainty associated with them (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burnham and Anderson, 2002</a>). This methodology can be particularly appropriate in the study of complex ecological systems, where multiple interactions take place, and the interest is in finding strong and consistent predictors of a particular outcome. In our study, variables with a relative importance (<i>w</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>) larger than 0.8 in these sets of best models and with consistent sign (positive or negative) within the CI were considered to have strong support as predictors of <i>MU</i> positivity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Calcagno, 2013</a>)."

Physico-chemical characteristics of water bodies were log transformed when necessary to approximate a Gaussian distribution (<i>pH</i>, dissolved oxygen, conductivity). We also transformed water flow into a categorical variable with three levels, stagnant (0 m/s), lentic (0\u20130.1 m/s), and lotic (&gt;0.1 m/s).

Finally, variables with more than 5% missing values (turbidity, phosphates, and sulphates) were discarded in the multivariate analysis to allow for comparable AICs during model selection."

By studying these factors in combination with abiotic conditions, we can not only identify the most relevant ones but also gain insight into the contribution of the two <i>MU</i> transmission routes previously described. For instance, a positive <i>MU</i> association with community abundance or diversity in environments with favourable conditions would be suggestive of density dependent or direct transmission. On the contrary, if trophic transmission was the main transmission route, likely in environments with unfavourable conditions, <i>MU</i> could be positively or negatively associated with host taxa depending on their competency. To study community composition, we calculated total abundance and Shannon index (at the taxonomic order level) for each aquatic community. Relative abundance of each aquatic taxon (taxon abundance/total abundance) was also included. Since total and relative abundance of aquatic taxa were Poisson distributed, these were log transformed to avoid problems related to the skewness of variable distributions. Furthermore, the less abundant aquatic taxa (with more than 40% zero values) were introduced as dichotomous variables, and we removed the very rare taxa (with more than 90% zero values; essentially Plecoptera and Bivalvia). Semi-aquatic or terrestrial taxa collected during the aquatic sampling (Lepidoptera, Araneae, Collembola) were not included either, since they are not likely to play an important role in the aquatic community. Finally, the taxon Cladocera, with more than 5% missing values, was also discarded."

Firstly, all variables were tested individually as fixed effects in univariate binomial regressions with the site of collection as random effect. Those variables showing a significant effect were retained for an initial multivariate model. A backward procedure was then applied on this initial model in order to select, one by one, the variables that did not significantly improve the model (based on likelihood ratio tests) and, among these, we dropped those variables that resulted in the model with the lowest AIC. Secondly, a forward procedure was carried out by adding to this reduced model, one by one, all variables that significantly improved the model (likelihood ratio test) and, among those, those that resulted in the model with the lowest AIC. At each step, we checked whether the addition of the new variable made others insignificant, in which case, we dropped those variables from the model. The final model was obtained when no significant improvement could be achieved with the addition of new variables. Violation of model assumptions was checked in the final models. Colinearity was assessed through graphical exploration of explanatory variables, correlation tests, and variance inflation factors (VIF) in the final model. Independence was assessed by studying the spatial (correlograms) and temporal correlation (cross-correlations) of the model residuals."

Firstly, the effect of seasonality remained for Akonolinga after accounting for water parameters and biological factors. Secondly, regarding water conditions, <i>pH</i> had a significant positive effect on <i>MU</i> presence in Akonolinga, whereas in Bankim the negative effect of water flow was evident, with lotic ecosystems being the least positive, followed by lentic ones, which had significantly lower positivity than stagnant ecosystems. Finally, the effect of aquatic communities through total abundance was significant and inversely correlated with <i>MU</i> in Akonolinga, while in Bankim Shannon's diversity showed a positive correlation with <i>MU</i> presence. Individual taxa that remained significant and inversely correlated with <i>MU</i> were Gastropoda, Decapoda, Hemiptera and Anura for Akonolinga; and Ephemeroptera, fish, Diptera and Anura for Bankim. The only taxon positively correlated with <i>MU</i> in the final model was Hirudinea in Akonolinga and Coleoptera for Bankim. In summary, the results obtained from multi-model selection and classical model selection procedures were qualitatively and quantitatively similar."

It is however important to unravel the multiple pathways and relative contributions of each to informing, customising and targeting interventions. The authors took advantage of a combination of large environmental datasets on <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> (<i>MU</i>) to characterize abiotic and biotic factors driving the dynamics of this pathogen in two different regions of Cameroon. <i>M. ulcerans</i> is an environmentally persistent microorganism associated to freshwater ecosystems and present in a large variety of aquatic hosts and from a public health perspective, it is the agent responsible for Buruli ulcer (BU), a devastating skin disease with great health and socio-economic consequences in tropical and subtropical countries. They were able to identify abiotic and biotic drivers that may promote or block MU transmission in aquatic communities in two climatically distinct regions of Cameroon through a comprehensive multi-model selection procedure. They demonstrate regional differences in transmission dynamics that is influenced by seasonality, pH, rate of water flow, density of biotic and abiotic systems thereby advancing our understanding of underlying ecological mechanisms driving the emergence and persistence of <i>M. ulcerans</i>. These findings are by no means definitive and would require additional studies to validate these findings. Notwithstanding this limitation in the context of an upsurge in the emergence and re-emergence of multiple infectious diseases identifying main drivers of host\u2013parasite interactions particularly those associated with pathology and have public health implications these types of endeavours are critically important. The findings are novel and the approach used is a mix of classical model selection procedures with cutting-edge new selection methods to identify and quantify the most important predictors of <i>MU</i> dynamics. The authors are very careful and considered in their discussion of the implications of separating out the contributions of biotic and abiotic factors for host/parasite interactions and the importance of rigorously analysing the underlying drivers of transmission dynamics mediated through complex and diverse processes."

We have restructured the Results section to explain separately the three groups of factors (seasonal, abiotic, and biotic), instead of separating them by region. We also provide a short background of what is being tested in each case before explaining the results obtained. In addition, we have expanded the Materials and methods section to explain the hypothesis being tested for each of these three groups of factors and the expected results before explaining how they were tested in the models. This can now be found as a separate part of the data analysis subsection called \u201cHypotheses and use of variables\u201d."
