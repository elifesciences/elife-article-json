The inner COPII proteins bind to cargo and membrane, linking them to the outer COPII components that form a cage around the vesicle. Regulated flexibility in coat architecture is essential for transport of a variety of differently sized cargoes, but structural data on the assembled coat has not been available. We have used cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to determine the structure of the complete, membrane-assembled COPII coat. We describe a novel arrangement of the outer coat and find that the inner coat can assemble into regular lattices. The data reveal how coat subunits interact with one another and with the membrane, suggesting how coordinated assembly of inner and outer coats can mediate and regulate packaging of vesicles ranging from small spheres to large tubular carriers."

The inner COPII proteins bind to cargo and membrane, linking them to the outer COPII components that form a cage around the vesicle. Regulated flexibility in coat architecture is essential for transport of a variety of differently sized cargoes, but structural data on the assembled coat has not been available. We have used cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to determine the structure of the complete, membrane-assembled COPII coat. We describe a novel arrangement of the outer coat and find that the inner coat can assemble into regular lattices. The data reveal how coat subunits interact with one another and with the membrane, suggesting how coordinated assembly of inner and outer coats can mediate and regulate packaging of vesicles ranging from small spheres to large tubular carriers."

Assembly of COPII coat proteins on the membrane leads to generation of coated membrane vesicles carrying cargo molecules. Vesicle formation proceeds via sequential assembly of the coat components. It is initiated by the small GTPase, Sar1. Upon exchange of GDP for GTP (catalysed by Sec12), Sar1 exposes an N-terminal amphipathic helix that inserts into the outer ER membrane leaflet, promoting curvature (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lee et al., 2005</a>). Sar1 recruits heterodimers of Sec23 and Sec24 to the membrane, thereby forming the inner layer of the COPII coat (<a href=\"#bib19\">Matsuoka et al., 1998</a>). Sec23/24 is an adaptor complex: Sec24 binds transport cargo while Sec23 interacts with Sar1 and recruits Sec13/31 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Miller et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bi et al., 2007</a>). Sec13/31 heterotetramers constitute the outer coat layer, thought to polymerise into cages that enclose the budding membrane (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fath et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Stagg et al., 2008</a>). GTP hydrolysis on Sar1, activated by Sec23 and further accelerated by Sec31, completes the cycle by promoting fission of the bud and coat depolymerization (<a href=\"#bib30\">Zanetti et al., 2012</a>)."

Available structural data for the inner coat is limited to isolated subcomplexes. Progress has been made in understanding how the outer coat subunits assemble into a coat by using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to derive models of Sec13/31 cages formed in vitro under high salt conditions in the absence of membrane (<a href=\"#bib27\">Stagg et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bhattacharya et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Noble et al., 2012</a>). A comparison of the vertices and edges in cages of different sizes (60\u2013100 nm) has suggested geometrical rules governing outer coat assembly, and indicated regions of flexibility in Sec13/31 that permit envelopment of vesicles with sizes ranging from 60 to 120 nm (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fath et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Stagg et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bhattacharya et al., 2012</a>). Nevertheless, a higher degree of flexibility in COPII architecture is needed to explain the ability of COPII to mediate secretion of cargoes such as 300 nm pro-collagen fibres, which are much larger than the 60\u2013100 nm in vitro assembled cages. There is increasing evidence that incorporation of pro-collagen into COPII coated vesicles is a highly regulated process, and that modifications in the outer coat proteins\u2014such as ubiquitination\u2014as well as in timing of GTP hydrolysis and coat recycling may be necessary for COPII ability to coat large vesicles (<a href=\"#bib26\">Saito et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Jin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Venditti et al., 2012</a>). COPII-dependent defects in collagen transport are linked to a genetic syndrome characterized by late-closing fontanels, sutural cataracts, facial dysmorphisms and skeletal defects: Cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boyadjiev et al., 2006</a>)."

How do the inner and outer coat components arrange to form a membrane coat? How do they interact with the membrane? How do they interact with each other? Are the existing models for the outer COPII coat cages representative of the complete coat assembled on a membrane? What is the structural basis for COPII ability to transport large or elongated cargoes such as pro-collagen? Here we address these questions. We provide evidence for coordinated assembly of the two layers of the coat on a lipid membrane and suggest how this interplay may effect shape changes essential to the capture of large and unusually-shaped secretory cargo complexes and particles."

To this end we have studied a reconstituted COPII assembly reaction (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bacia et al., 2011</a>). We incubated giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) with yeast COPII proteins (Sec12, Sar1, Sec23/24, Sec13/31) in the presence of a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GMP-PNP. We imaged the reaction mixture by cryo-electron tomography, observing that coated membranes of a variety of shapes and sizes were generated. These included round vesicles, either independent or still attached to the donor membrane, as well as curved or extended tubes, reminiscent of those detected budding from ER exit sites in vivo (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mironov et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fromme et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Venditti et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). All of these structures were surrounded by two protein layers indicating that the COPII coat can assemble on membranes with a range of different curvatures. The outer coat appeared in sections as points or lines (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and in grazing slices as a regular arrangement of X-shaped features arrayed to form a rhomboidal lattice (a lozenge pattern) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Other geometries, such as triangles and pentagons, were observed on vesicles and tube ends (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). These geometries are similar to those formed when purified Sec13/31 proteins assemble in vitro in the absence of a membrane (<a href=\"#bib27\">Stagg et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2008</a>). The inner coat layer also appeared as a regular array (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), implying that Sar1 and Sec23/24 can also assemble to form a lattice."

The vertex forms upon interaction of four N-terminal Sec31 \u03b2-propellers. The \u03b2-propellers on two heterotetramer rods (purple) face each other at the center of the vertex and are referred to as the \u2018plus\u2019 ends of the rods, while the \u03b2-propellers on the other two rods (green) are further away from the center, and are referred to as the \u2018minus\u2019 ends.

When viewing the vertex from outside the cage, alpha is defined as the clockwise angle from \u2018+\u2019 to \u2018\u2212\u2019, and beta the clockwise angle from \u2018\u2212\u2019 to \u2018+\u2019.

                                "text": "The published EM reconstructions of in vitro assembled COPII outer coat protein cages reveal that the Sec31 \u03b2-propeller domains at the ends of two Sec13/31 rods (referred to in the literature as the plus ends) contact each other directly at the center of the vertex, whereas the ends of the other two rods (the minus ends) contact the plus ends at the side and are more distant from the center of the vertex. The geometrical relationship of the \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\u2212\u2019 rod ends at the vertex can be described by two angles: alpha (clockwise between + and \u2212 ends, which is 60\u00b0 in the cages), and beta (clockwise between \u2212 and + ends which is variable at least between 90\u00b0 and 108\u00b0 in the cages) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Stagg et al., 2008</a>). Within the in vitro assembled cages each Sec13/31 rod makes a \u2018+\u2019 contact at one end and a \u2018\u2212\u2019 contact at the other end. This arrangement allows assembly of a coat that curves in two directions, appropriate for coating spherical membranes. (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In our reconstructions, the arrangement of Sec13/31 rods we observed at the rounded tips of tubes and on spherical membranes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) was similar to that seen in in vitro assembled cages, consistent with the presence of such \u2018+/\u2212\u2019 rods (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). When we analysed the distribution of vertices (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and rods (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) on the tubular membranes we found that they assembled regions of rhomboidal lattice. A rhomboidal lattice could be built in two ways: each vertex could be rotated by approximately 90\u00b0 in the plane of the membrane relative to the adjacent vertices, or each vertex could have the same orientation (see schematic in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). The final structure of the vertex on the tubes clearly shows the expected twofold features of the vertex previously described by Stagg et al. (<a href=\"#bib23\">Noble et al., 2012</a>), indicating that the majority of vertices have the same orientation (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In this arrangement of vertices the rods oriented in one direction (the right handed rods, purple in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C and 3B</a>) each make two \u2018+\u2019 contacts (+/+), while the left-handed rods (green in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C and 3B</a>) each make two \u2018\u2212\u2019 contacts (\u2212/\u2212). The alpha angle is 79.7\u00b0 \u00b1 5.9\u00b0 and is oriented around the tube circumference while the beta angle is 95.7\u00b0 \u00b1 5.8\u00b0 and is oriented along the tube axis (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3</a>). Together these data imply that three properties contribute to outer coat adaptability: (i) variability of both alpha and beta angles at the vertices, (ii) flexibility of the central rod hinge, and (iii) the absence of any inherent asymmetry in the Sec13/31 rods, allowing them to make \u2018+\u2019 contacts at both ends, \u2018\u2212\u2019 contacts at both ends, or a \u2018+\u2019 contact at one end and a \u2018\u2212\u2019 contact at the other. Together this versatility allows coating of not only spherical, but also of tubular membranes and therefore accommodation of large elongated cargoes such as pro-collagen."

For example, the elongated heads of T-even phages, as well as the capsid cores of retroviruses, are assembled as closed structures built from hexamers and pentamers of the component protein and can have regions with spherical and with tubular curvatures (<a href=\"#bib2a\">Baschong et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib11a\">Ganser et al., 1999</a>). This structural flexibility can be understood within the framework of quasi-equivalence: while subunits are found in symmetrically different positions with different local curvatures, the contacts between the subunits are only subtly different (<a href=\"#bib6a\">Caspar and Klug, 1962</a>). In some virus capsids, subtle changes in the contacts are supplemented by structural switches that mediate the change from hexameric to pentameric assembly (<a href=\"#bib13a\">Johnson and Speir, 1997</a>). It seems likely that flexibility in the outer COPII cage geometry is primarily mediated by subtly varying contacts at multiple hinge positions in the rod and vertex (<a href=\"#bib23\">Noble et al., 2012</a>), but we cannot rule out the presence of structural switches."

Both fit unambiguously into one bow-tie shaped subunit as rigid bodies, in each case placing Sec23 in the same position (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Analysis of the fitted models reveals the novel network of interactions that mediate lattice formation and membrane binding. Two interfaces between the long edges of the Sar1/Sec23/24 heterotrimer mediate formation of lattice rows. The larger involves Sar1, the gelsolin-like and the C-terminal domain of Sec23 from one heterotrimer interacting with the Zn-finger and part of the beta barrel domains of Sec23 in the adjacent heterotrimer. The smaller interface is between the Zn-finger domain of Sec24 in one heterotrimer and the gelsolin-like and C-terminal domains of Sec24 in the neighbouring heterotrimer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These contacts are characterised by extended surfaces with opposite charges, a property that is conserved (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The rows contact each other where the beta barrel domain of Sec23 approaches the Sec24 N-terminus. In the Sec23/24 crystal structure (PDB ID 1M2V), the Sec24 N-terminal helix 61-73 forms a crystallographic contact with the beta-barrel domain of Sec23 in the neighbouring asymmetric unit (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bi et al., 2002</a>).

We identify two primary membrane interacting regions. One is formed by a small part of Sec23 together with Sar1, orienting Sar1 to direct its N-terminal amphipathic helix into the outer leaflet. The other is a large basic surface in Sec24, including the Sec24 Zn finger, beta barrel and alpha helical domains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). While the Sec24 Zn finger domain binds the membrane, the Sec23 Zn finger domain does not, instead it faces the neighbouring heterotrimer, suggesting that the role of the Zn fingers in Sec23 and Sec24 has diverged. Consistent with this difference in function, the Sec24 Zn finger, essential for cell survival (<a href=\"#bib24\">Peng et al., 1999</a>), contains a conserved basic patch that is absent in Sec23. We speculate that, analogous to the basic Zn fingers in FYVE domains (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gaullier et al., 2000</a>), this represents a phospholipid-binding site. The trunk domains of Sec23 and Sec24 do not contact the membrane but are suspended above it, leaving space that would allow binding to more highly curved vesicles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

Strikingly, comparison of the co-crystal structure of Sec23/24/Sec22 with our density map reveals that the space between heterotrimers in the assembled inner coat lattice forms a pocket into which Sec22 would bind (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

Three factors suggest, however, that the interactions we observe between heterotrimers are relevant in vivo and are not simply an artefact of in vitro assembly. Firstly, they result from a productive assembly reaction that bends the GUV membrane into a variety of shapes. Secondly, the interfaces have conserved electrostatic properties. Thirdly, the interactions that mediate inner coat lattice assembly are distinct from those that mediate membrane binding, outer coat binding, and cargo binding and can accommodate Sec22 in the correct position: they are fully compatible with available biochemical and structural data."

Our structure of the outer coat does not reveal density corresponding to an ordered inner coat, and vice versa, indicating that the relative positions of the two coat layers are not fixed. Nevertheless, the two layers are approximately aligned both in spacing and orientation. The \u2018rows\u2019 in the inner coat are aligned to the left-handed rods of the outer coat, with four inner coat heterotrimers spanning one outer coat rod. The inner coat \u2018columns\u2019 are aligned to the right-handed outer coat rods, with two inner coat heterotrimers spanning one outer coat rod (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This relationship suggests that the unstructured C-terminal region of Sec31 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fath et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Noble et al., 2012</a>), which connects the inner and outer coats, constrains the coat layers but does not fix their absolute positions, much like multiple anchor cables on a ship. This flexibility in the relative positions of the two layers would permit adaptation of the coat to variable curvatures. Gaps and dislocations in both inner and outer coat lattices may further contribute to curvature variability."

The top panel shows the density for the inner coat obtained in cages formed in the presence of Sec23 alone (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bhattacharya et al., 2012</a>). The bottom panel shows the density for the inner layer in cages formed in the presence of Sec23/24 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Stagg et al., 2008</a>). The position of the outer coat is marked as a blue outline. Note that in both studies, the twofold symmetry of the outer coat vertex was imposed on the inner coat. (<b>B</b>) Based on the comparison between the structures in panel <b>A</b>, Stagg et al. proposed that Sec23 binds at two positions: one copy below each vertex and two copies at its side. Sec24 would be located under the holes in the cage (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bhattacharya et al., 2012</a>). According to this model, the inner coat arrangement does not conform to the twofold symmetry applied during the reconstruction procedure, explaining why it is poorly resolved in the cage reconstruction. (<b>C</b>) A previous model was proposed based on the reconstruction of icosidodecahedral cages (bottom panel in <b>A</b>). In this model, Sec23/24 subunits are oriented with their long axes in the direction of the +/+ connection of the outer coat vertex. Two arrangements consistent with this model are shown: in the first (top) the subunits all have the same orientation, in the second (bottom), subunits have opposite orientations, following the twofold symmetry of the outer coat. (<b>D</b>) A schematic representation of the relationship between inner and outer coat as identifed in this study. This arrangement is similar to the model suggested in <b>C</b> (top). The stoichiometry of the two coat layers is 1:2 outer:inner in coated tubes, meaning that only half of the inner coat subunits are bound by the known Sec31 interface. The percentage of bound inner coat subunits would be higher on spherical vesicles. The difficulty in resolving the position of the inner coat in the studies of cages assembled in the absence of a membrane can be explained by our observation that the relative positions of outer and inner coats are constrained but not fixed, and that the two layers do not follow the same symmetry."

We found that both coats can assemble regular lattices with constrained relative positions. This relationship would permit the inner coat to influence the arrangement of the outer coat and therefore to play a critical structural role in determining vesicle shape. Our data hint at the possibility that the formation of larger arrays of the inner coat and the formation of associated rhomboidal outer coat lattices, could favour the formation of larger tubular carriers able to accommodate cargoes such as pro-collagen. It has previously been proposed that proteins such as TANGO1 and Sedlin (<a href=\"#bib26\">Saito et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Jin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Venditti et al., 2012</a>) act in concert to stabilize the inner coat, modulating Sar1 GTPase activity and delaying both outer coat recruitment and scission. We suggest that stabilization of the inner coat could promote growth of larger carriers not only by delaying scission, but also by promoting tubular membrane morphology (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

(<b>B</b>) If the inner coat forms large arrays instead of small patches, then the outer coat, interacting with the inner coat in its preferred orientation, will tend to arrange to form a lozenge pattern. This arrangement of inner and outer coats results in coated tubular membranes. This arrangement could simply be promoted by packaging of elongated cargoes. It could also be favoured when external factors intervene to either delay outer coat recruitment, and/or stabilise larger inner coat patches.

The FSCs between the average structure from one single tomogram with the structures obtained from every other individual tomogram should therefore all intersect at the first zero of the single tomogram.

Independent fitting of the X-ray atomic models Sec23/Sar1 (PDB 2QTV) and Sec23/24 (PDB 1M2V) in the central segmented unit placed Sec23 in the same position, with an RMSD between the two Sec23 molecules of about 3 \u00c5. We therefore created a single PDB file containing Sar1, Sec23 and Sec24 and fitted it as a rigid body. The N-terminus of Sec24 is absent from the X-ray model. Only helix 61\u201373 is resolved, detached from the rest of the sec24 molecule, and tightly associated to the gelsolin-like domain of Sec23 through crystal contacts. When we included the Sec24 N-terminal 61\u201373 helix in the relevant pocket on sec23, this did not significantly change the positions of the fitted molecules."

A number of observations rule out the alternative possibility that the orientation of the vertices is random or alternate such that half the vertices are rotated by 90\u00b0 to place alpha along the tube axis (this would be the case if the rods were +/\u2212). Firstly, the final structure, obtained from vertices with similar in plane rotations within each tube, clearly shows the expected twofold features of the vertex as previously described by <a href=\"#bib27\">Stagg et al. (2006)</a>, and is not a smeared average of vertices in different orthogonal orientations. Secondly, a classification of the aligned vertex subtomograms did not identify a class rotated by 90\u00b0 relative to other classes. Thirdly, the measured distance between vertices along +/+ rods is as expected significantly shorter than along \u2212/\u2212 rods, by 17 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3</a>). Taking measurements from the fitted structures of the in vitro assembled cages one would expect a difference of approximately 40 \u00c5, though this estimate does not take into account structural differences, between the vertices and rods of cages and those of tubes, which affect these distances. If the vertices were alternately oriented then all rods would be +/\u2212 and no difference would be expected. Equally, no difference would be expected if the vertices were randomly oriented and linked by a mixture of +/+, \u2212/\u2212 and +/\u2212 rods. Fourthly, measuring alpha and beta based on the coordinates of the vertex and its neighbours, gave an alpha angle of 80\u00b0 and a beta angle of 96\u00b0. If the vertices were alternatively oriented then no difference would be expected. Fifthly, where alpha and beta could be measured in this way at individual vertices, then beta angle was in over 90% of cases larger than alpha."

The difference between the coats studied in the work reported in this MS by electron cryotomography (cryoET) with subtomogram averaging and those studied previously by single-particle reconstruction is the mode of preparation. These are made by in vitro budding from GUVs; the previous coats were assembled from protein only. The new structures show that Sec13/Sec31 forms tubular lattices as well as the isometric (round) structures seen in the earlier work and that the inner protein layer (Sar1/Sec23/Sec24) packs, in these particles, into a locally ordered lattice, related to the lattice of the outer layer in the tubular regions. The main discovery is that Sec13/31 can form an extended rhomboidal lattice to coat membrane tubes \u2013 a variation on the triangle/square/pentagon polyhedra described previously. The results described in the manuscript clearly add to our knowledge of COPII coat structures, and when the manuscript is revised to meet the concerns listed below, it should meet the criteria for publication in <i>eLife</i>. The reviewing editor does wish to emphasize that he will only consider the revision if it includes real modifications that indeed respond to these concerns."

These proteins have been driven onto membrane by the non-hydrolyzable GppNHp, resulting in their two-fold excess over Sec13/31. The authors describe tantalizing features of this regular array: the electrostatic complementarity of lattice contacts, the nice fit of modeled Sec22 SNARE, the packing of a Sec24 peptide element onto Sec23. But all this might be akin to a description of the lattice of a protein crystal. Some further discussion of this issue is needed, to make it clear that the extensive regularity might be a feature of the in vitro assembly. For example, the authors might consider to what extent cargo with appreciable cytoplasmic mass could fit into these tubular regions if they are coated with such a close-packed Sec23/24-Sar1 lattice."

The explanation that is offered for how the Sec13/31 lattice differs on tubes and spheres doesn't seem quite definitive. (The alpha and beta angles are germane, but mention of them tends to confuse as much as to resolve the issue). In the simplest sense, the extended lattice arises because the Sec13/31 rods can assemble into an array of squares (rhomboids). The +/+ and -/- arrangement of rods is not absolutely required for a rhomboidal lattice to form; a +/- arrangement would work, it would retain two-fold vertex centers. Rather, the importance of the +/+ -/- arrangement is presumably that this geometry brings the Sec13/31 lattice into close (though still imperfect) register with the inner Sec23/24-Sar1 lattice. Regarding this point, it isn't clear how continuous the +/+ -/- arrangement really is along the tubular membranes. In the Table of <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3 - figure supplement 3</a>, the difference between the cell edges for the left-handed (31.9 nm) and right-handed (30.2 nm) \u201chelices\u201d seems a bit small. It would be useful if the authors could measure this based on the Sec13/31 crystal structure. Could there in fact be occasional dislocations in the +/+ -/- lattice?"

Those groups examined different classes of polyheads and suggested how subunit packing might generate them. Recall also that T-even phages actually have elongated heads (because of a \u201cwaist\u201d between the two rounded ends, each with hemi-icosahedral symmetry), and giant T4 phages have very long heads (extended tubular waists). More recently, the beautiful work of Sundquist and Finch on cone-like assemblies of the HIV-1 capsid protein illustrates an even more striking polymorphism that generates tapered tubes.

The explanation that is offered for how the Sec13/31 lattice differs on tubes and spheres doesn't seem quite definitive. (The alpha and beta angles are germane, but mention of them tends to confuse as much as to resolve the issue). In the simplest sense, the extended lattice arises because the Sec13/31 rods can assemble into an array of squares (rhomboids). The +/+ and -/- arrangement of rods is not absolutely required for a rhomboidal lattice to form; a +/- arrangement would work, it would retain two-fold vertex centers. Rather, the importance of the +/+ -/- arrangement is presumably that this geometry brings the Sec13/31 lattice into close (though still imperfect) register with the inner Sec23/24-Sar1 lattice. Regarding this point, it isn't clear how continuous the +/+ -/- arrangement really is along the tubular membranes. In the Table of</i> <a href=\"#fig3s3\"><i>Figure 3 - figure supplement 3</i></a><i>, the difference between the cell edges for the left-handed (31.9 nm) and right-handed (30.2 nm) \u201chelices\u201d seems a bit small.

The reviewers are correct that a +/- arrangement could also assemble a rhomboidal lattice, but this would require firstly that the vertex can deform to the point that alpha and beta angles are equal and secondly that it can be oriented in two ninety-degree rotated positions relative to the underlying curvature of the tube surface. In contrast, the +/+, -/- arrangement allows a rhomboidal lattice to form while maintaining a smaller alpha angle and larger beta angle at all vertices. Put more simply, assembling a rhomboidal lattice on the surface of the tube using a +/- arrangement would require a more substantial deformation of the vertex.
