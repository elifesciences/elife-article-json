The molecular details of AFP adsorption-inhibition is uncertain but is proposed to involve the Gibbs-Thomspon effect. Here we show by using unbiased molecular dynamics simulations a protein structure-function mechanism for the spruce budworm <i>Choristoneura fumiferana</i> AFP, including stereo-specific binding and consequential melting and freezing inhibition. The protein binds indirectly to the prism ice face through a linear array of ordered water molecules that are structurally distinct from the ice. Mutation of the ice binding surface disrupts water-ordering and abolishes activity. The adsorption is virtually irreversible, and we confirm the ice growth inhibition is consistent with the Gibbs-Thompson law."
