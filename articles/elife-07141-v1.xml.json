This enzyme is responsible for reducing all four ribonucleotide substrates, with specificity regulated by the binding of an effector to a distal allosteric site. In all characterized RNRs, the binding of effector dATP alters the active site to select for pyrimidines over purines, whereas effectors dGTP and TTP select for substrates ADP and GDP, respectively. Here, we have determined structures of <i>Escherichia coli</i> class Ia RNR with all four substrate/specificity effector-pairs bound (CDP/dATP, UDP/dATP, ADP/dGTP, GDP/TTP) that reveal the conformational rearrangements responsible for this remarkable allostery. These structures delineate how RNR \u2018reads\u2019 the base of each effector and communicates substrate preference to the active site by forming differential hydrogen bonds, thereby maintaining the proper balance of deoxynucleotides in the cell."

This enzyme is responsible for reducing all four ribonucleotide substrates, with specificity regulated by the binding of an effector to a distal allosteric site. In all characterized RNRs, the binding of effector dATP alters the active site to select for pyrimidines over purines, whereas effectors dGTP and TTP select for substrates ADP and GDP, respectively. Here, we have determined structures of <i>Escherichia coli</i> class Ia RNR with all four substrate/specificity effector-pairs bound (CDP/dATP, UDP/dATP, ADP/dGTP, GDP/TTP) that reveal the conformational rearrangements responsible for this remarkable allostery. These structures delineate how RNR \u2018reads\u2019 the base of each effector and communicates substrate preference to the active site by forming differential hydrogen bonds, thereby maintaining the proper balance of deoxynucleotides in the cell."

This then means that a ribonucleotide called ADP will bind in preference to the other ribonucleotides.

In the absence of nucleotides, the active site adopts a shape that resembles an open barrel. However, when RNR is bound to a deoxyribonucleotide at the specificity site and a ribonucleotide at the active site, the barrel clamps down, bringing the specificity site and the active site closer together. Additionally, a loop of the protein interacts with each of the deoxyribonucleotides in a different way and communicates their identity directly to the active site, which rearranges itself to hold on to the corresponding preferred ribonucleotide."

                        "text": "Deoxyribonucleotides, the building blocks for DNA biosynthesis, are produced in the cell from ribonucleotide precursors by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Three classes of RNRs are known, categorized by the cofactor they use to generate a protein radical required for catalysis. The best characterized of all RNRs is the class Ia enzyme from <i>Escherichia coli</i> that employs a di-iron-tyrosyl-radical cofactor to initiate chemistry and requires two dimeric protein subunits for enzymatic activity. The \u03b1<sub>2</sub> subunit contains two (\u03b2/\u03b1)<sub>10</sub> barrels, which house the active sites at the barrel centers (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eriksson et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Uhlin and Eklund, 1994</a>), and the \u03b2<sub>2</sub> subunit utilizes a largely helical secondary structure to house the radical cofactor (<a href=\"#bib32\">Sj\u00f6berg and Reichard, 1977</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>). As a central controller of nucleotide metabolism, RNR uses multiple allosteric mechanisms to maintain the balanced deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools that are required for accurate DNA replication. First, allosteric activity regulation modulates the overall size of dNTP pools. ATP or dATP binding at an allosteric activity site, found at the N-terminus of \u03b1<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), leads to up-regulation or down-regulation of enzyme activity, respectively (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown and Reichard, 1969</a>). In <i>E. coli</i> class Ia RNR, this regulation is achieved by changes in the oligomeric arrangement of the \u03b1<sub>2</sub> and \u03b2<sub>2</sub> subunits (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown and Reichard, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Rofougaran et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ando et al., 2011</a>). When ATP is bound at the activity site, an \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub> complex is favored. Although no X-ray structure of the active complex has been determined, low resolution models have been generated using small-angle X-ray scattering (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ando et al., 2011</a>), electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib22\">Minnihan et al., 2013</a>), and distance measurements made through spectroscopic analyses (<a href=\"#bib31\">Seyedsayamdost et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This active \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub> complex is capable of a long-range proton coupled electron transfer from \u03b2<sub>2</sub> to \u03b1<sub>2</sub>, forming a transient thiyl radical on Cys439 to initiate catalysis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Licht et al., 1996</a>). Alternatively, when concentrations of dATP become too high in the cell, dATP binds at the allosteric activity site and formation of an \u03b1<sub>4</sub>\u03b2<sub>4</sub> complex is promoted. The structure of this complex was recently solved (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ando et al., 2011</a>), revealing a ring of alternating \u03b1<sub>2</sub> and \u03b2<sub>2</sub> units that cannot form a productive electron transfer path, thus inhibiting the enzyme (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

                        "text": "The second form of allosteric regulation is specificity regulation, which maintains the proper relative ratios of dNTPs in the cell. Briefly, the binding of (d)NTP effectors to an allosteric specificity site in \u03b1<sub>2</sub> influences the preference of RNR for its four nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) substrates. Whereas high levels of dATP inhibit class Ia RNR, at lower levels, dATP promotes CDP or UDP reduction. Likewise, TTP promotes GDP reduction, and dGTP promotes ADP reduction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown and Reichard, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Rofougaran et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">von D\u00f6beln and Reichard, 1976</a>). Importantly, the affinity of the \u03b1<sub>2</sub> and \u03b2<sub>2</sub> subunits for each other is weak (~0.4 \u03bcM) in the absence of effectors, whereas the binding of a complementary substrate/specificity effector pair increases the affinity of the class Ia RNR subunits fivefold (<a href=\"#bib9\">Crona et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hassan et al., 2008</a>). Previous structural work, which includes: X-ray structures of GDP and TTP bound to <i>E. coli</i> \u03b1<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eriksson et al., 1997</a>), structures of all four substrate/effector pairs bound to class Ia \u03b1<sub>2</sub> from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Xu et al., 2006</a>), and class II \u03b1<sub>2</sub> from <i>Thermotoga maritima</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Larsson et al., 2004</a>), revealed the location of the allosteric specificity sites at the ends of a four helix bundle at the dimer interface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These data, and accompanying\u00a0in vitro and in vivo studies on <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmad et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kumar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kumar et al., 2011</a>), also implicated which residues (Gln294 and Arg298, <i>E. coli</i> numbering) and which regions of the structure are involved in the communication between the specificity site and the active site. A flexible loop, termed loop 2 (residues 292\u2013301 in <i>E. coli</i>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), bridges the two sites, which are approximately 15\u2009\u00c5 apart, and becomes more ordered upon effector and substrate binding (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eriksson et al., 1997</a>). An additional loop, termed loop 1 (residues 259\u2013278), is also near the effector-binding site and is stabilized upon effector binding (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eriksson et al., 1997</a>). Thus, previous work established the players involved in allosteric specificity regulation in RNR. This work supports those assignments, and goes on to provide a novel set of crystallographic snapshots that reveal how these residues in the prototypic RNR from <i>E. coli</i> are able to communicate and thereby regulate substrate preference."

An initial superposition of one \u03b1 chain from the previously reported free \u03b1<sub>2</sub> soaked with AMP-PNP (PDB ID: 3R1R (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eriksson et al., 1997</a>)) onto the \u03b1<sub>4</sub>\u03b2<sub>4</sub> crystal form was performed using only residues 432\u2013446, that comprise the conserved active site loop (\u2018finger loop\u2019) found in the center of the (\u03b2/\u03b1)<sub>10</sub> barrel. In this structural alignment, one half of the active site barrel overlays exactly, whereas the second half of the barrel and the N-terminal portion of the structure has undergone a clamping movement (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). To better characterize this movement, a difference distance matrix (DDM) was calculated. This plot reveals relative movements in a reference-independent manner. Briefly, the distance between every possible pair of atoms in one chain of \u03b1 from the \u03b1<sub>4</sub>\u03b2<sub>4</sub> structure is subtracted from the same distance measured in the free \u03b1<sub>2</sub> structure, giving a representation of how much the distances between pairs of atoms change between the two structures.

Thr209 is part of the N-terminal region that is shown to move in the DDM analysis. The structure superposition and DDM analysis also indicate that loop 2 shifts, bringing Arg298 closer to the active site. The Arg298 side chain now forms a cation-\u03c0 interaction with the substrate base and a charge-charge interaction with the substrate \u03b2-phosphate. In the substrate-free structure, this side chain is pointing in the opposite direction. Protein contacts like Arg298 to the substrate diphosphate are expected to be particularly important for charge neutralization in enzymes, such as <i>E. coli</i> RNR, that do not employ metal cations such as Mg<sup>2+</sup> for this purpose. The positions of residues that contact the ribose O3' (Glu441 and Asn437) are virtually unchanged between the NDP-free and NDP-bound structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

In this structure, Ser622, Ser625, and Thr209 are all 3.0\u2009\u00c5 or greater from the substrate diphosphate, and Arg298 points away from the active site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These weaker (or missing) interactions between protein and substrate in this previously determined structure are consistent with the fact that substrate is observed in an altered orientation in the active site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>) and is only present at half occupancy. We attribute the differences in substrate positioning in this structure to the inability of the active site barrel to clamp around substrate due to crystal lattice contacts. Symmetry-related molecules are closer to the active site in the \u03b1<sub>2</sub>-only crystalline state than they are in the \u03b1<sub>4</sub>\u03b2<sub>4</sub> crystal form. Importantly, differences in flexibility cannot be attributed to the fact that \u03b1<sub>4</sub>\u03b2<sub>4</sub> is an inactive state of <i>E. coli</i> RNR because \u03b1<sub>2</sub> is also an inactive state; the former because \u03b2<sub>2</sub> is held at arm\u2019s length from \u03b1<sub>2</sub>,\u00a0and the latter because \u03b2<sub>2</sub> is absent altogether. Additionally, other than contributing to an amenable crystal lattice, there is nothing to suggest that \u03b2<sub>2</sub> must be present for \u03b1<sub>2</sub> to clamp. When lattice contacts do not restrain \u03b1<sub>2</sub> movement, \u03b1<sub>2</sub> should be able to clamp in the presence of a cognate substrate/effector pair regardless of \u03b2<sub>2.</sub> Thus, it seems that different crystal forms have given us two distinct snapshots of substrate-bound states for the <i>E. coli</i> class Ia enzyme: a high affinity state which is closed and ready for radical-based chemistry when \u03b2<sub>2</sub> becomes available (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and a lower affinity state in which substrate is still exposed to solvent and not ready to undergo catalysis, regardless of the availability of \u03b2<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

On the effector side of loop 2, Cys292 packs against the base of all three effectors (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>), consistent with binding studies that show the affinity for all specificity effectors is decreased when Cys292 is mutated to alanine (<a href=\"#bib24\">Orm\u00f6 and Sj\u00f6berg, 1996</a>). The remaining interactions with loop 2 are distinct for each substrate/effector pair (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>). dATP, which preferentially increases RNR activity for CDP and UDP substrates, makes two hydrogen bonds with loop 2. The backbone amide and carbonyl of Ser293 are in position to hydrogen bond to N1 and N6, respectively, of the adenine base of dATP. These hydrogen bonds hold Ser293 in place and position the adjacent Gln294 in to a conformation that points into the substrate-binding site (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). In this conformation, Gln294 can form a hydrogen bond with O2 of CDP or UDP. There is no difference in substrate positioning between CDP and UDP, as the unique positions of the pyrimidine ring (N2 and N4/O4) are not involved in any contacts with the protein. Furthermore, the positioning of Gln294 by dATP selects for pyrimidine binding, as binding of a purine base would be disfavored due to steric occlusion by Gln294."

It is the only effector for which a hydrogen bond is formed between the base and loop 1. Because the position of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors at N1 and O6 in dGTP is opposite from that of N1 and N6 of dATP, the interaction with the backbone amide of Ser293 in loop 2 is unfavorable in this structure. Instead, Ser293 is shifted away from the base, and N1 and N2 \u2013 both hydrogen bond donors \u2013 form an interaction with the backbone carbonyl of Gln294, which has shifted away from the substrate (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8A\u2013C</a>). Ser293 thus makes no hydrogen bond contacts to dGTP and instead provides hydrogen bonds to Gly300 on the other side of loop 2 through both its side chain and backbone. Stabilization of Gly300 in this position in turn allows for a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of Gly299 with the N6 position of the preferred substrate, ADP. The movement of Gln294 away from the substrate-binding site allows room for the larger ADP to bind. Thus, Ser293 and Gln294 are responsible both for differentiating between the purine bases adenine and guanine at the effector-binding site and for differentiating pyrimidines from purines at the substrate site, either directly (in the case of Gln294 hydrogen bonding to CDP or UDP) or indirectly through stabilization of Gly299 and Gly300. With dATP bound, Ser293 plays a role in effector recognition and Gln294 in substrate recognition; these roles are reversed for ADP/dGTP."

With the smaller TTP in the effector site, Ser293 rearranges such that the carbonyl of Gly299 can relax \u2018backward\u2019 (toward the effector-side of loop 2, see <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>), allowing for a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of Gly299 and N1 and N2 of guanine.

To briefly summarize purine specificity, purines are favored over pyrimidines when Gln294 is positioned away from the active site creating a larger substrate-binding pocket, and ADP is favored over GDP when dGTP binding stabilizes Ser293 close to the Gly299 backbone pushing its carbonyl forward, and GDP is favored over ADP when TTP allows Ser293 to fall back."

To confirm this prediction, we prepared Gln294Ala and Arg298Ala mutant enzymes and tested the activity for each substrate/effector pair. Because dATP at high concentrations inhibits RNR activity by binding to the allosteric activity site, whereas at lower concentrations it is a specificity effector, we first carried out control experiments to determine activity levels for CDP reduction in the absence of dATP and at an inhibitory dATP concentration (175 \u03bcM) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Results show that wild-type RNR is as active (CDP/dATP) or more active (UDP/dATP) at 1 \u03bcM dATP than it is in the positive control (CDP/ATP), indicating that at 1 \u03bcM, dATP is acting as a specificity effector and not as an allosteric inhibitor of activity, consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib4\">Birgander et al., 2004</a>). The negative control shows the substantial decrease in wild-type RNR activity on CDP when the concentration of dATP is high enough (175 \u03bcM) for dATP to bind to the allosteric activity site and inhibit the enzyme. With these controls in place, the activity of mutant RNRs with all four substrate/effector pairs can be established. Our structures predict that mutation of Arg298 to alanine should decrease activity for all substrates, and that is exactly what we observe (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). The effect is dramatic for this mutant, with negligible activity\u00a0observed\u00a0in all cases. In fact, the small amount of activity detected could be due to low levels of contamination of wild-type <i>E. coli</i> RNR instead of the Arg298Ala mutant protein. Thus, Arg298Ala-RNR is either mostly or completely inactive. In contrast, for Gln294Ala-RNR, we would expect purine and pyrimidine substrates to be differentially affected, with minimal or no loss of activity on ADP/GDP and measurable loss on CDP/UDP, and that is again what we observe. For Gln294Ala, activity is the same as wild-type for ADP/dGTP and perhaps even higher than wild-type for GDP/TTP, whereas for both CDP and UDP with 1 \u03bcM dATP, activity is decreased (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). These results are consistent with the removal of the Gln294 side chain from the active site to create room for the larger substrates (ADP/GDP) to bind and also with the positioning of Gln294 into the active site to stabilize CDP/UDP binding through hydrogen-bonding to the respective bases."

We observe that in the absence of substrates or effectors (for example, in the previously reported structure of \u03b1<sub>2</sub> (PDB ID: 3R1R (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eriksson et al., 1997</a>)), the barrel is not clamped and loop 2 is not found in any of the conformations seen in our effector-bound structures (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). However, in the presence of substrate/effector pairs, we find a clamped down barrel and a stabilized loop 2 that adopts three different conformations depending on the allosteric effector that is bound (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013D</a>) (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Loop 2 residues Cys292, Ser293, and Gln294 appear to be involved in specific interactions that read out the identity of the base and communicate that identity to the active site. Briefly, dATP, which enhances reduction of CDP/UDP (<a href=\"#bib36\">von D\u00f6beln and Reichard, 1976</a>), makes specific contacts with Ser293, orienting Gln294 toward the active site and stabilizing the binding of both CDP and UDP (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013B</a>). The lack of discrimination between CDP and UDP substrates by RNR is not problematic for the cell as cytidine deaminase provides another level of control for dCTP/TTP ratios (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wang and Weiss, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">O'Donovan et al., 1971</a>). In contrast, dGTP binding stabilizes Gln294 away from the RNR active site, so that CDP/UDP binding is not stabilized (although it is not prohibited) and there is room for the larger purine substrates to bind and to hydrogen bond to the carbonyl of Gly299 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C\u2013D</a>). The creation of a more expansive active site is consistent with the ability of RNR to reduce both purine substrates in the presence of dGTP\u03b3S, albeit with a much greater fold activity increase for preferred substrate ADP (<a href=\"#bib36\">von D\u00f6beln and Reichard, 1976</a>). Specificity for ADP versus GDP appears to be modulated by whether effector-loop contacts stabilize the carbonyl of Gly299 in a forward or a backward position, respectively (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C\u2013D</a>). Thus, our structural data suggest that movement of Gln294 in and out of the active site alternatively shrinks and expands the active site for CDP/UDP versus ADP/GDP, whereas a more modest shift of the Gly299 carbonyl is involved in ADP/GDP selectivity. Mutagenesis of Gln294 to Ala is consistent with this proposal, showing decreased activity on CDP/UDP and no change or increased activity on ADP/GDP (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

These interactions yield what appears to be a high affinity substrate-bound state that is sequestered by solvent and thus amenable to radical-based chemistry. To invoke an analogy, Arg298 is like a latch on a suitcase, locking the active site barrel in cases in which the active site is appropriately packed (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). When a suitcase is packed with too many clothes, the latch cannot reach the lock, and the clothes are not secured. Similarly, a mismatched substrate/effector pair such as a purine nucleotide with dATP would not be expected to allow the barrel to clamp and loop 2 to rearrange such that Arg298 can reach the substrate phosphate and thus form a \u2018latched\u2019 complex (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). In the latter case, one would expect the mismatched substrate to be released from the enzyme, so that a complementary one can bind. Chemical logic tells us that allosteric regulation of specificity would require both low and high affinity substrate/effector-enzyme states; low affinity states to sample substrate/effector pairs, and high affinity states to capture the correct pair, recruit \u03b2<sub>2</sub> (class I) or adenosylcobalamin (class II), and initiate catalysis (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Although the molecular basis for the fivefold increase in binding affinity of \u03b2<sub>2</sub> for \u03b1<sub>2</sub> in <i>E. coli</i> class Ia RNR in the presence of bound substrate/effector pairs is not understood, the clamping of the barrel that we observe here may be part of the molecular explanation. The use of Arg298 as a molecular latch to secure the barrel in this closed state is beautiful in its simplicity. It is also consistent with both our structural and our biochemical data that show almost complete loss of activity in the Arg298Ala variant (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

This GDP/TTP-bound structure is the only <i>T. maritima</i> RNR structure in which loop 2 is fully ordered and it is remarkably similar to our <i>E. coli</i> structures (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10H,I</a>).

Structural comparisons show that the protein does not pack as tightly around purine substrates when Gln points into the active site as it does when Gln is flipped away (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E,F</a> compared with 10H,I). It is possible that this difference in Gln positioning in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, and differences described above for Arg298 (<i>E. coli</i> numbering), indicate that the mechanism of allosteric regulation is not conserved among RNRs. However, it is also possible that these observed structural differences are a result of crystal packing variations or other deviations in how crystals were prepared. Additional structures of high-affinity RNR-substrate complexes will help to clarify the degree to which the roles of Gln294 and Arg298 are conserved across RNR species. Regardless of their exact roles in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> RNR, there are a number of studies that support the importance of these residues (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmad et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kumar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kumar et al., 2011</a>). In particular, when mutant RNR is the only RNR being expressed in <i>S. cerevisiae,</i> mutation of Arg293 (the Arg298 equivalent) to Ala is lethal, and mutation of Gln288 (the Gln294 equivalent) to Ala yields a severe S phase defect (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmad et al., 2012</a>). Gln288Ala mutation in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> also leads to substantially elevated dGTP/dATP levels compared with dCTP/TTP levels when one compares wild-type <i>S. cerevisiae</i> expressing two wild-type RNRs with mutant <i>S. cerevisiae</i> expressing one wild-type RNR and one Gln288Ala mutant RNR (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kumar et al., 2010</a>). Under the same experimental conditions, all four dNTPs are elevated by similar amounts (within 1\u20133%) for the Arg293Ala mutation in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kumar et al., 2010</a>). Although more studies are clearly needed to confirm or refute that the molecular basis of allosteric specificity regulation among RNRs is conserved, it is interesting to note that our in vitro data on <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) is consistent with the more severe phenotype in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> for Arg than Gln mutation and is consistent with the observation that mutation of Gln in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> elevates purines over pyrimidines whereas mutation of Arg does not show differential elevation."

Our structures show how each specificity effector is read out at a distal allosteric site and how that information is communicated to the active site where residues rearrange such that specific hydrogen bonds can be formed with the cognate substrate base. When an effector/substrate match is discovered, the barrel is clamped and latched in preparation for catalysis. Just as DNA replication and transcription take advantage of the unique hydrogen-bonding properties of each nucleotide base, enzymatic ribonucleotide reduction also employs these unique hydrogen-bonding properties for specificity regulation. Through an elegant set of protein rearrangements, <i>E. coli</i> RNR screens and selects its substrate from the four potential NDPs, ensuring appropriate pools of deoxynucleotides are available for DNA biosynthesis and repair."
