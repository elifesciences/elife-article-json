But late-LTP and memory are maintained without PKM\u03b6 in PKM\u03b6-null mice. Two hypotheses can account for these findings. First, PKM\u03b6 is unimportant for LTP or memory. Second, PKM\u03b6 is essential for late-LTP and long-term memory in wild-type mice, and PKM\u03b6-null mice recruit compensatory mechanisms. We find that whereas PKM\u03b6 persistently increases in LTP maintenance in wild-type mice, PKC\u03b9/\u03bb, a gene-product closely related to PKM\u03b6, persistently increases in LTP maintenance in PKM\u03b6-null mice. Using a pharmacogenetic approach, we find PKM\u03b6-antisense in hippocampus blocks late-LTP and spatial long-term memory in wild-type mice, but not in PKM\u03b6-null mice without the target mRNA. Conversely, a PKC\u03b9/\u03bb-antagonist disrupts late-LTP and spatial memory in PKM\u03b6-null mice but not in wild-type mice. Thus, whereas PKM\u03b6 is essential for wild-type LTP and long-term memory, persistent PKC\u03b9/\u03bb activation compensates for PKM\u03b6 loss in PKM\u03b6-null mice."

But late-LTP and memory are maintained without PKM\u03b6 in PKM\u03b6-null mice. Two hypotheses can account for these findings. First, PKM\u03b6 is unimportant for LTP or memory. Second, PKM\u03b6 is essential for late-LTP and long-term memory in wild-type mice, and PKM\u03b6-null mice recruit compensatory mechanisms. We find that whereas PKM\u03b6 persistently increases in LTP maintenance in wild-type mice, PKC\u03b9/\u03bb, a gene-product closely related to PKM\u03b6, persistently increases in LTP maintenance in PKM\u03b6-null mice. Using a pharmacogenetic approach, we find PKM\u03b6-antisense in hippocampus blocks late-LTP and spatial long-term memory in wild-type mice, but not in PKM\u03b6-null mice without the target mRNA. Conversely, a PKC\u03b9/\u03bb-antagonist disrupts late-LTP and spatial memory in PKM\u03b6-null mice but not in wild-type mice. Thus, whereas PKM\u03b6 is essential for wild-type LTP and long-term memory, persistent PKC\u03b9/\u03bb activation compensates for PKM\u03b6 loss in PKM\u03b6-null mice."

During learning, neurons produce an enzyme called PKMzeta (or PKM\u03b6), which is thought to be responsible for maintaining the newly strengthened connections. Inhibitors of PKMzeta, such as a drug called ZIP, disrupt long-term memories. This suggests that the brain may be like a computer hard disc in that its stored information \u2014 its memories \u2014 could be erased."

Induction is thought to rely solely on post-translational modifications. Maintenance requires new protein synthesis soon after strong synaptic stimulation or learning, and these newly synthesized proteins are believed to sustain the synaptic potentiation or behavioral modification (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kandel and Schwartz, 1982</a>). Although numerous signal transduction molecules are important for LTP and long-term memory, most have been implicated in induction, with many participating in either the initial transient potentiation or the mechanisms for upregulating new protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</a>). In contrast, few molecules have been implicated in maintenance. Such a maintenance molecule would be both: 1) a product of de\u00a0novo protein synthesis sufficient to enhance synaptic transmission and 2) a necessary component of the mechanism sustaining synaptic potentiation and long-term memory, as shown by\u00a0inhibition of the molecule reversing sustained\u00a0synaptic potentiation and erasing long-term memory."

LTP and long-term memory maintenance may depend upon the function of PKM\u03b6 because data suggest the kinase possesses the two essential properties of a maintenance molecule. First, PKM\u03b6 is produced in LTP by new protein synthesis and is sufficient to potentiate synaptic transmission. PKM\u03b6 is generated from a PKM\u03b6 mRNA, but this mRNA is translationally repressed in the basal state of neurons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hernandez et al., 2003</a>). During LTP, strong afferent synaptic stimulation derepresses the mRNA and rapidly increases the de\u00a0novo synthesis of PKM\u03b6 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hernandez et al., 2003</a>). The newly synthesized kinase, unlike most other protein kinases, is autonomously active without the requirement for second messenger stimulation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sacktor et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hernandez et al., 2003</a>), and the autonomous activity of PKM\u03b6 is sufficient to enhance synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ling et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yao et al., 2008</a>).

Moreover, the PKM\u03b6-inhibitor ZIP, which disrupts the maintenance of LTP and long-term memory in wild-type animals, disrupts these same processes in PKM\u03b6-null mice (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Volk et al., 2013</a>). Two hypotheses can account for these findings (<a href=\"#bib12\">Frankland and Josselyn, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Matt and Hell, 2013</a>). First, in a straightforward hypothesis, PKM\u03b6 is unnecessary for LTP or long-term memory, and therefore genetically deleting PKM\u03b6 has no effect on these processes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Volk et al., 2013</a>). Second, PKM\u03b6 is essential for late-LTP and long-term memory in wild-type mice, and compensatory mechanisms emerge in the mutant mice to substitute for PKM\u03b6, which are also inhibited by ZIP. Here, we used a pharmacogenetic approach to distinguish between the 'PKM\u03b6 is unnecessary hypothesis' and the 'PKM\u03b6 is compensated hypothesis'."

The <i>Prkcz</i> gene consists of an autoinhibitory PKC\u03b6 regulatory domain exon region (Reg, shown in red) and a catalytic domain exon region (Cat, green). In neurons in wild-type mice, PKM\u03b6 is produced by an internal promoter within the <i>Prkcz</i> gene, transcribing a PKM\u03b6 mRNA that expresses an independent \u03b6 catalytic domain (indicated as step [1] [<a href=\"#bib15\">Hernandez et al., 2003</a>]). The PKM\u03b6 mRNA is transported to dendrites (<a href=\"#bib30\">Muslimov et al., 2004</a>) but is translationally repressed ([2] [<a href=\"#bib15\">Hernandez et al., 2003</a>]). During tetanic stimulation, glutamate (Glu) activates the NMDAR to stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent induction mechanisms that release the translational block ([3] [<a href=\"#bib15\">Hernandez et al., 2003</a>]), resulting in synthesis of PKM\u03b6 ([4] [<a href=\"#bib15\">Hernandez et al., 2003</a>]), which potentiates postsynaptic AMPARs ([5] [<a href=\"#bib23\">Ling et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Serrano et al., 2005</a>]). If wild-type mice express persistently enhanced AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission through synthesis of PKM\u03b6 and PKM\u03b6-null mice through compensatory mechanisms, then PKM\u03b6-antisense will block LTP in wild-type mice (left) but have no effect in PKM\u03b6-null mice (right).

(<b>B</b>) Characterization of PKM\u03b6 and PKC\u03b9/\u03bb enzymatic activity. Left, PKC\u03b9/\u03bb is stimulated by lipids and has autonomous activity in the absence of lipids (with and without phosphatidylserine, n's = 4, t<sub>3</sub> = 9.35, p = 0.0026, d = 4.68; baseline vs. without phosphatidylserine, t<sub>3</sub> = 4.37, p = 0.022, d = 2.18). PKM\u03b6 is entirely autonomously active, showing no significant difference in activity with or without lipids (n\u2019s = 4, t<sub>3</sub> = 1.33, p = 0.28, d = 0.67). Right, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) phosphorylation of PKC\u03b9/\u03bb\u2019s activation loop, which is measured by phospho-specific antiserum in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, enhances PKC\u03b9/\u03bb\u2019s autonomous activity (n\u2019s = 8, t<sub>7</sub> = 4.88, p = 0.0018, d = 1.72). PDK1 does not phosphorylate the standard \u03b5-peptide substrate used to assay atypical PKCs."

Therefore, in order to test PKC\u03b9/\u03bb\u2019s potential function in maintaining LTP in PKM\u03b6-null mice, we examined the effects of a PKC\u03b9/\u03bb-antagonist applied only after late-LTP had been established. We used the cell-permeable antagonist [4-(5-amino-4-carbamoylimidazol-1-yl)-2,3-dihydroxycyclopentyl] methyl dihydrogen (ICAP) that blocks PKC\u03b9/\u03bb, and not \u03b6 kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pillai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sajan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">2014</a>).

The selective effect of the PKC\u03b9/\u03bb-inhibitor on only PKM\u03b6-null-LTP maintenance is predicted by the PKM\u03b6-compensation hypothesis, but not by the PKM\u03b6-unnecessary hypothesis."

After entering the shock zone, shocks are repeated every 1.5 s until the mouse leaves the zone. The ability to escape shock is estimated by counting the number of shocks the mouse received before it left the shock zone. Within the first training trial both the wild-type and PKM\u03b6-null mice learn to leave the shock zone so they only rarely receive more than 1 shock. This indicates good and equivalent ability to escape in the two groups throughout the training. These observations are confirmed by a significant genotype X trial interaction (F<sub>16,255</sub> = 4.8, p = 1.54 X 10<sup>\u20138</sup>, \u03b7<sup>2</sup> = 0.11). Post-hoc test detects that for both genotypes during pretraining with shock off, the number of shocks the mice would have received for each shock zone entrance (had the shock been on) is greater than during all the training sessions with shock on, as expected. During retention with the shock off, post-hoc test detects that\u00a0the PKM\u03b6-null animals would have received more shocks for each entrance into the shock zone than the wild-type mice. This difference is consistent with worse retention of avoidance memory in the PKM\u03b6-null mice and may indicate that the place avoidance memory is less persistent in the PKM\u03b6-null mice because it rapidly extinguishes (n\u2019s = 10)."

But a second hypothesis that could account for these data is that the mechanisms of LTP and long-term memory in wild-type and PKM\u03b6-null mice are not the same, and that PKM\u03b6 is essential for these processes in wild-type mice and compensatory mechanisms are recruited in PKM\u03b6-null mice. We used a pharmacogenetic approach to distinguish between these hypotheses. ZIP and chelerythrine are PKM\u03b6-inhibitors but cannot easily be used in a pharmacogenetic approach because they can block the action of both PKM\u03b6 and PKC\u03b9/\u03bb (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

In contrast to applications of inhibitors of PKM\u03b6\u2019s phosphotransferase activity that disrupt LTP and long-term memory after PKM\u03b6 has already been synthesized (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ling et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Serrano et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pastalkova et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shema et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cai et al., 2011</a>), we applied the PKM\u03b6-antisense during the critical temporal window of new protein synthesis during late-LTP and long-term memory formation when general protein synthesis inhibitors such as anisomycin are effective (<a href=\"#bib13\">Frey and Morris, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Davis and Squire, 1984</a>), and when PKM\u03b6 is formed (<a href=\"#bib34\">Osten et al., 1996</a>).

This suggests that the crucial pool of PKM\u03b6 protein sustaining synaptic potentiation in wild-type mice is synthesized de\u00a0novo in response to tetanization, rather than through the recruitment of pre-existing PKM\u03b6 that had been synthesized before the tetanus."

We found that whereas the increase in PKC\u03b9/\u03bb after tetanization is transient in wild-type mice (<a href=\"#bib34\">Osten et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kelly et al., 2007</a>), the increase in PKC\u03b9/\u03bb persists in PKM\u03b6-null mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In wild-type mice, PKC\u03b9/\u03bb is important for early-LTP, and if PKC\u03b9/\u03bb is inhibited at the time of afferent synaptic tetanization, neither early- nor late-LTP is formed (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ren et al., 2013</a>). In addition, PKC\u03b9/\u03bb-null mice, which can only be partially compensated by PKC\u03b6, are embryonically lethal (<a href=\"#bib49\">Seidl et al., 2013</a>), and therefore studies of LTP using null mutations in which both atypical PKCs are completely eliminated are not feasible. Therefore, to test for a possible role of PKC\u03b9/\u03bb in LTP maintenance, we acutely suppressed the activity of PKC\u03b9/\u03bb after late-LTP and spatial long-term memory had been established. We used ICAP that selectively blocks PKC\u03b9/\u03bb and not \u03b6 kinase activities and which was developed based upon data from the crystal structure of the PKC\u03b9/\u03bb catalytic domain (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pillai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sajan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">2014</a>). ICAP is designed to convert in cells to a compound that targets and binds to a docking site present in the PKC\u03b9/\u03bb catalytic domain, but not in the very closely related PKC/PKM\u03b6 catalytic domain, thus competing for binding of substrate proteins to \u03b9/\u03bb and not \u03b6 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pillai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sajan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">2014</a>).

But there is little information on ICAP on other kinases. Therefore, it is possible that ICAP may block the action of other molecules that may contribute to the maintenance of late-LTP and long-term memory in the PKM\u03b6-null mice (e.g. PKC\u03b2I, which also increases in PKM\u03b6-null mice, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Although off-target effects of ICAP are thus possible, nonetheless, the specificity of the agent in reversing LTP and spatial memory maintenance in PKM\u03b6-null mice and not in wild-type mice demonstrates that the mechanisms of maintenance in the two mouse genotypes are distinct and is predicted by the PKM\u03b6-compensation hypothesis."

ZIP does not block the ability of the conventional and novel PKCs to mediate synaptic potentiation, indicating selectivity of the inhibitor towards atypical PKC isoforms (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Specificity of ZIP toward atypical PKCs is further supported by evidence that ZIP\u2019s effects on LTP reversal and memory disruption in wild-type animals are completely blocked by preventing the reversal of PKM\u03b6\u2019s action on AMPAR-trafficking, indicating the absence of additional, off-target effects of ZIP in brain slices or in vivo (<a href=\"#bib28\">Migues et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pauli et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Evuarherhe et al., 2014</a>).

A possible role for new synthesis of PKC\u03b9/\u03bb in PKM\u03b6-null-LTP is consistent with data that a\u00a0general protein synthesis inhibitor blocks the formation of late-LTP in PKM\u03b6-null mice (<a href=\"#bib56\">Volk et al., 2013</a>). Our results suggest the possibility that in wild-type mice PKM\u03b6 suppresses the persistent increase of PKC\u03b9/\u03bb and that in the PKM\u03b6-null mice without this repression the increase of PKC\u03b9/\u03bb is sustained. PKM\u03b6 and PKC\u03b9/\u03bb compete for protein binding partners in developing neurons, suggesting that the loss of PKM\u03b6 may allow for increased binding of PKC\u03b9/\u03bb to these proteins that might augment its stability and function (<a href=\"#bib36\">Parker et al., 2013</a>). Whereas PKM\u03b6-null mice produce compensatory increases in PKC\u03b9/\u03bb (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), the acute suppression of PKM\u03b6 synthesis by antisense does not (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Conditional PKM\u03b6 knockdown mice, which show LTP like PKM\u03b6-null mice (<a href=\"#bib56\">Volk et al., 2013</a>), have not yet been examined for compensation by PKC\u03b9/\u03bb or other molecules. Like the antisense, shRNA knockdown of PKM\u03b6 has been found not to induce compensation by PKC\u03b9/\u03bb, and to disrupt both late-LTP and long-term memory formation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dong et al., 2015</a>).

When active place avoidance is made more difficult to acquire, for the first few days of conditioning wild-type mice explore the arena to find the safest location to avoid the shock, but PKM\u03b6-null mice avoid in the least safe position adjacent to the shock zone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). After several more days of training, the PKM\u03b6-null mice switch to the wild-type strategy, but nonetheless perform poorly compared to wild-type mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a>). These differences in conditioned behavior may be a sign that the PKM\u03b6-null mice are defective in learning and memory or in integrating information about the relative safety of multiple areas of the arena. Likewise, during unreinforced novel object placement tasks, both mice with and without PKM\u03b6 remember a single object-location association discrimination, but when the number of object location-association discriminations is increased to two, wild-type mice remember well, but PKM\u03b6-null mice express no memory for the learned information (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

In contrast to the second messenger-independent PKM\u03b6, PKC\u03b9/\u03bb can respond to second messengers that might be generated by short-term experiences (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akimoto et al., 1994</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Thus, in tasks with high cognitive demand, wild-type animals that express both isoforms can use PKC\u03b9/\u03bb and PKM\u03b6 for separate functions\u2014PKC\u03b9/\u03bb for encoding information about short-term experiences, and PKM\u03b6 for encoding information derived from these short-term experiences to be stored in long-term memory. But when PKC\u03b9/\u03bb is used for both short-term memory and as a 'back-up' mechanism for long-term memory in the PKM\u03b6-null mice, its continued responsiveness to second messengers produced by short-term experiences may interfere with its function in long-term memory. For example, during active place avoidance, when PKM\u03b6-null mice attempt to find the safest location in an arena, information from one recently visited place might interfere with the integration of information from multiple places required for forming the optimal avoidance strategy. Likewise, in novel object placement, short-term memories of recently visited single object locations may suppress the encoding of multiple object-place associations in a single scheme. Further study of PKM\u03b6-null mutant mice might thus reveal fundamental insights into how PKM\u03b6 encodes and stores information in long-term memory under physiological conditions in normal animals."

The persistent action of PKM\u03b6 could function to launch or to sustain for a period the structural changes such as new synaptic connections (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2014</a>), which once established become independent of PKM\u03b6. Many of the remote long-term memories lasting a lifetime are thought to be stored in neocortex. Therefore, this hypothesis could be tested experimentally by examining when a long-term memory that can be erased by PKM\u03b6 inhibition in neocortex becomes resistant to this inhibition. So far, PKM\u03b6-dependence has been tested for up to 1-3 months. In the published experiments on remote memory in neocortex, intracranial injections of ZIP disrupt 1-month-old fear memories in visual, auditory, and olfactory cortices (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sacco and Sacchetti, 2010</a>), and 3-month-old conditioned taste aversion memories in insular cortex (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shema et al., 2009</a>).

Training (Days 2\u20134): the mice were allowed to explore a pair of environments, Contexts A and B, each during two 5\u00a0min trials/day, separated by a 1\u00a0hr intertrial interval. This allowed the mice to learn the spatial arrangement of the four objects in each box. Retention testing (Days 5 and 6): retention of spatial memory was evaluated on subsequent days by the object/context mismatch and the object/place mismatch tests.

Each mouse was allowed to explore the altered environment for 3\u2009min, and the time spent exploring each object was recorded.

The PKM\u03b6 is unnecessary and the PKM\u03b6 is compensated hypotheses predict all-or-none effects in the experiments, and this provided a basis for sample size estimates. Power analyses were performed using G*Power Version 3.0.6 with \u03b1 = 0.05 and \u03b2 = 0.8 and large effect sizes of 1.5\u20132.0. The effect size estimates were based on prior studies that demonstrated essentially all-or-none effects of PKM\u03b6 inhibition on the biochemical, physiological, and behavioral assays used here (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sacktor et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Osten et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ling et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kelly et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pastalkova et al., 2006</a>). Two-population Student\u2019s t tests were performed to compare protein levels in the PKM\u03b6-null and wild-type mice. For LTP experiments the responses to test stimuli were averaged across 5 min for statistical comparisons. Paired Student\u2019s t tests were used to compare the change in the potentiated response at time points at the beginning and end of drug application. Multi-factor comparisons were performed using ANOVA with repeated measures, as appropriate. The degrees of freedom for the critical t values of the t tests and the F values of the ANOVAs are reported as subscripts. Post-hoc multiple comparisons were performed by Newman-Keuls tests as appropriate. Statistical significance was accepted at p&lt;0.05. Effect sizes for binary comparisons and one-way ANOVAs are reported as Cohen's d and as \u03b7<sup>2</sup> for two-way ANOVA effects."

This is \u2013 surely \u2013 important work. My reading of the manuscript reveals some questions, which I will come to, but my sense is that the key experiments have been conducted to test the idea that PKM\u03b6 is compensated by another atypical PKC in PKM\u03b6 null mice, and that this mediates late-LTP and long term memory in such genetically modified mice. The work involves the use of a non-discriminating drug (ZIP), specific antisense molecules, and another compound that targets the compensating PKC\u03b9. And the manuscript is beautifully written and accompanied by excellent figures."

The driving concept behind this is stated clearly in the first paragraph of the Introduction in which it is asserted that the hypothesis of a molecule implicated in maintenance has specific experimental predictions. I fear that the senior author's view on this is <i>not</i> shared by others as a third possibility is not considered \u2013 namely that a molecule implicated in maintenance, while to be sure not contributing to initial memory formation, might not be sustained throughout the lifetime of a memory. To the contrary, it may trigger structural changes mediated by other molecules, and then depart the scene and no longer be involved. These structural changes would then be recycled during protein turnover in some way (but that is a separate albeit related problem in memory). An analogy might be helpful here. Consider a space rocket already in space that is circling the earth and is to be sent to the moon. For a brief period, the thrusters are activated and the rocket escapes earth's gravity and speeds up. It is on its way to the moon. The engines are stopped and the rocket keeps going. Should we look for the 'molecules' that sustain its motion towards the moon, akin to maintaining a memory as in Sacktor's argument? Or do we recognise that Newton's Laws of Motion distinguish acceleration and velocity and recognise that nothing is needed to sustain velocity in space? The molecules that make memory retention possible could, like the engines on a rocket, be activated only briefly."

These papers were widely discussed and the general 'backchat' is that they had demolished Sacktor's story.

The group went on to test a molecule ICAP that affects PKC\u03b9/\u03bb selectively and establish that its application reverses late-LTP in PKM\u03b6 null mice but not in wild-type mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

The authors are responding to a finding that mice, in which PKM\u03b6 is knocked out by homologous recombination, still show late LTP and that LTP is still inhibited by an inhibitor of PKM\u03b6 termed ZIP. The authors correctly state that the latter findings support either of two hypotheses: 1. PKM\u03b6 is unnecessary for long term memory and late-phase LTP; or 2. PKM\u03b6 is essential for these processes in wild-type mice, and compensatory mechanisms emerge in the PKM\u03b6 mutant to substitute for PKM\u03b6. They systematically show that in the hippocampus, increased synthesis of PKC\u03b9/\u03bb compensates for the lack of PKM\u03b6 in the mutant. PKC\u03b9/\u03bb, like PKM\u03b6, is inhibited by ZIP, which explains the earlier results in the PKM\u03b6 KO mutant."

Scrambled antisense oligonucleotides are the control. In contrast, the PKM\u03b6 specific oligonucleotides do not block late phase LTP in slices from the PKM\u03b6 KO mutant. This experiment demonstrates that a compensatory mechanism not involving PKM\u03b6 has arisen in the mutant mice. I note that in cultured neurons, one would expect the experimenters to show rescue of late-LTP by exogenously expressed PKM\u03b6 in conjunction with endogenous anti-sense knock-down. I do not think this particular control is necessary here because it would be very difficult to carry out cleanly in slices and animals; and later experiments by the authors make it clear that the compensatory process involves higher synthesis of PKC\u03b9/\u03bb, which they show is not blocked by the anti-sense DNA against PKM\u03b6."

They further show that new synthesis of PKC\u03b9/\u03bb increases after induction of LTP in PKM\u03b6 KO mice, but does not increase in wild-type mice. These experiments, together with the catalytic similarity between PKC\u03b9/\u03bb and PKM\u03b6, make a strong case that PKC\u03b9/\u03bb compensates for the loss of PKM\u03b6 in the KO mice, during late-LTP."

                    "text": "<i>My main concern Over 20 years, Dr Sacktor has been building a story about identifying the likely molecular mechanism of long-term memory. The driving concept behind this is stated clearly in the first paragraph of the Introduction in which it is asserted that the hypothesis of a molecule implicated in maintenance has specific experimental predictions. I fear that the senior author's view on this is not shared by others as a third possibility is not considered \u2013 namely that a molecule implicated in maintenance, while to be sure not contributing to initial memory formation, might not be sustained throughout the lifetime of a memory. To the contrary, it may trigger structural changes mediated by other molecules, and then depart the scene and no longer be involved. These structural changes would then be recycled during protein turnover in some way (but that is a separate albeit related problem in memory). An analogy might be helpful here. Consider a space rocket already in space that is circling the earth and is to be sent to the moon. For a brief period, the thrusters are activated and the rocket escapes earth's gravity and speeds up. It is on its way to the moon. The engines are stopped and the rocket keeps going. Should we look for the 'molecules' that sustain its motion towards the moon, akin to maintaining a memory as in Sacktor's argument? Or do we recognise that Newton's Laws of Motion distinguish acceleration and velocity and recognise that nothing is needed to sustain velocity in space? The molecules that make memory retention possible could, like the engines on a rocket, be activated only briefly.</i> The relationship between the persistent increased activity of PKM\u03b6 and the persistent changes in synaptic morphology proposed to sustain long-term memory for a lifetime is an important question for future research. The persistent action of PKM\u03b6 could act to launch or to sustain for a period the structural changes such as new synaptic connections (Chen et al., <i>eLife</i>, 3, e03896, 2014), which once established become independent of PKM\u03b6. Many of the remote long-term memories lasting a lifetime are thought to be stored in neocortex. Therefore, this hypothesis could be tested experimentally by examining when a long-term memory that can be erased by injections of ZIP in neocortex becomes resistant to PKM\u03b6 inhibition. So far, PKM\u03b6-dependence has been tested for up to 3 months. In the published experiments on remote memory in neocortex, intracranial injections of ZIP disrupt 1-month-old fear memories in visual, auditory, and olfactory cortices (Sacco and Sacchetti, 329, 649-56, 2010), and 3-month-old conditioned taste aversion memories in insular cortex (Shema et al., 16, 122-8, 2009). Future studies should examine even older memories."
