At the time, these islands of CpG dinucleotides were presumed to be the location of <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (regions of DNA that regulate the expression of nearby genes) and, in particular, to be the location of gene promoters (regions of DNA that initiate the transcription of genes)."

Frequently ignored is the fact that the annotation only works if we exclude the substantial proportion of the genome that is repetitive DNA, mostly the remnants of self-replicating virus-like elements that have all of the sequence characteristics of the CpG island but are rarely found to be regulatory elements (<a href=\"#bib4\">Glass et al., 2007</a>). A defining feature of CpG islands is that they tend to escape DNA methylation (the addition of a methyl group to cytosine), whereas cytosines in the genome as a whole, and in repetitive DNA in particular, tend to be heavily methylated (<a href=\"#bib9\">Yoder et al., 1997</a>). The question that emerges is whether the CpG island annotation merely acts as a surrogate for an absence of DNA methylation, which is much more relevant when we are searching for <i>cis</i>-regulators in the genome."

They report that when they looked for loci that escape DNA methylation in a set of non-human genomes, they found the CpG island annotation to be very poorly associated with these unmethylated loci (<a href=\"#bib6\">Long et al., 2013</a>). They used a technique called biotinylated CxxC affinity purification (Bio-CAP), followed by massively parallel sequencing, to identify islands of non-methylated DNA in seven highly divergent vertebrate species, ranging from fish to humans."

Long, Sims and co-workers found that the base composition of the non-methylated islands in the different species varied substantially. Moreover, the non-methylated islands were conserved more between the species than the CpG islands were, which suggests that they are more biologically meaningful. The results also demonstrate that the CpG island annotation performs especially poorly in non-human species."

The use of 51 base pair single-end reads in the Bio-CAP approach also makes it less likely that non-methylated islands in repetitive DNA (where it is more difficult to map such short reads) will be identified, should they happen to exist. However, as a survey technique, the Bio-CAP approach has many strengths. It should also be recognized that shotgun bisulphite sequencing, the gold standard for DNA methylation studies, does not comprehensively test every cytosine in the genome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Harris et al., 2010</a>), strengthening the justification for survey techniques in the short term until a better genome-wide approach is developed."

However, despite this possibility, Long, Sims and co-workers were able to compare cells taken from the liver and testes and identify non-methylated islands that were specific to each tissue type. The tissue-specific islands were shorter and contained fewer CpG dinucleotides than those found in both types of tissue, a finding that is reminiscent of work at Stanford that identified two classes of gene promoters\u2014one with high levels of CpG dinucleotides and one with lower levels (<a href=\"#bib7\">Saxonov et al., 2006</a>)."

Base composition has served us well for over a quarter of a century in defining the candidate <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements we call CpG islands, but we are now in a different era in which functional elements can be annotated at high resolution based on molecular assays in individual cell types. At first these annotations were generated by large collaborations\u2014such as the ENCODE collaboration (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dunham et al., 2012</a>), the modENCODE collaboration (<a href=\"#bib2\">Celniker et al., 2009</a>), and the Roadmap in Epigenomics (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bernstein et al., 2010</a>)\u2014but it is becoming increasingly feasible for individual investigators to generate such annotations. This has enormous potential value in allowing us to understand the information located at non-protein coding sequences in the genome. Moreover, as Long, Sims and colleagues clearly demonstrate, the ability to do this is a prerequisite for performing comparative studies between species."

For example, is there a minimum size for these features? If a single CpG dinucleotide remains unmethylated in all the cell types tested, surely it should be considered as a potentially significant locus? And if a locus is partially unmethylated on a consistent basis, how unmethylated does it have to be to be a candidate regulatory element? Is conservation of DNA methylation patterns the best way to identify candidates for regulatory elements, or are there other ways?"
