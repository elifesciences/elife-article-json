The presence of a specific leaf meristem is debated, as anatomical features typical of meristems are not present in leaves. Here we demonstrate that multiple NGATHA (NGA) and CINCINNATA-class-TCP (CIN-TCP) transcription factors act redundantly, shortly after leaf initiation, to gradually restrict the activity of a leaf meristem in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to marginal and basal domains, and that their absence confers persistent marginal growth to leaves, cotyledons and floral organs. Following primordia initiation, the restriction of the broadly acting leaf meristem to the margins is mediated by the juxtaposition of adaxial and abaxial domains and maintained by WOX homeobox transcription factors, whereas other marginal elaboration genes are dispensable for its maintenance. This genetic framework parallels the morphogenetic program of shoot apical meristems and may represent a relic of an ancestral shoot system from which seed plant leaves evolved."

The presence of a specific leaf meristem is debated, as anatomical features typical of meristems are not present in leaves. Here we demonstrate that multiple NGATHA (NGA) and CINCINNATA-class-TCP (CIN-TCP) transcription factors act redundantly, shortly after leaf initiation, to gradually restrict the activity of a leaf meristem in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to marginal and basal domains, and that their absence confers persistent marginal growth to leaves, cotyledons and floral organs. Following primordia initiation, the restriction of the broadly acting leaf meristem to the margins is mediated by the juxtaposition of adaxial and abaxial domains and maintained by WOX homeobox transcription factors, whereas other marginal elaboration genes are dispensable for its maintenance. This genetic framework parallels the morphogenetic program of shoot apical meristems and may represent a relic of an ancestral shoot system from which seed plant leaves evolved."

Fossil evidence indicates that seed plant leaves evolved from ancestral shoot systems, and further, the dichotomous morphology of early seed plant leaves suggests growth via a persistent apical meristem (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib35\">Kenrick and Crane, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Floyd and Bowman, 2010</a>]). However, as anatomical features typical of apical or vascular meristems are not present in leaves, whether developing leaves grow from a localized meristem has been debated for nearly a century (<a href=\"#bib18\">Foster, 1936</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hagemann and Gleissberg, 1996</a>)."

Subsequently, Avery suggested that early lamina growth of <i>Nicotiana tabaccum</i> was initiated by a row of subepidermal initial cells located at the upper-lower (adaxial-abaxial) leaf boundary that he termed the 'marginal meristem' (<a href=\"#bib4\">Avery, 1933</a>). However, it had already been noted that later protracted growth in leaves occurs in tissues that are not marginal, but rather within the developing lamina in a region described as a 'plate meristem' (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sch\u00fcepp, 1918</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">1926</a>). Thus, early views of leaf development were perceived to consist of two growth phases (<a href=\"#bib18\">Foster, 1936</a>). An early ephemeral phase of cell divisions without cell expansion produces the characteristic 6\u201310 cell layers of the leaf thickness via submarginal periclinal cell divisions and epidermal anticlinal divisions. This is followed by a later prolonged growth phase where the bulk of two-dimensional lamina growth is produced via a plate meristem in which cell divisions are predominantly anticlinal. Analyses of leaf development in the middle of the 20th century sought to identify patterns of submarginal cell divisions to identify initial cells, but the patterns of cell division were highly variable between species casting doubt on the presence of specific initials (<a href=\"#bib18\">Foster, 1936</a>)."

Furthermore, sector analysis of leaf development in several eudicot species, including <i>N. tabacum</i>, revealed that most clonal sectors were located between the midrib and the margin, with only a minority extending all the way to the margin (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dulieu, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Poethig and Sussex, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dolan and Poethig, 1998</a>), indicating that leaves do not grow from the margins sensu stricto, and calling into question the concept of the leaf marginal meristem. However, noting the overall lack of organized cell division patterns in plants, Hagemann and Gleissberg argued that the defining features of meristems are their organogenetic potential and cytohistological state rather than specific cell division patterns. Thus, in their view the marginal meristem (or \u2018blastozone\u2019, as they refer to it) is responsible for primary morphogenetic events, e.g. lamina initiation, but is used up early in leaf development, with most lamina expansion occurring during a later leaf differentiation phase (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hagemann and Gleissberg, 1996</a>). Although this is a compelling model, evidence for this interpretation has been mainly observational and circumstantial."

Lamina development requires the\u00a0juxtaposition of abaxial/adaxial polarity factors, including adaxial class III HD-Zip and abaxial KANADI transcription factors. These lie on either side of a narrow middle domain expressing the <i>WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX</i> (<i>WOX</i>) genes, <i>PRESSED FLOWER (PRS</i>) and <i>WOX1</i>, and together promote organ growth and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nakata et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eshed et al., 2004</a>). In <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaf development, expression of growth genes rapidly diminishes distally but can persist proximally (<a href=\"#bib9\">Donnelly et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nath et al., 2003</a>). This proximo-distal differentiation gradient is regulated by CIN-TCP transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nath et al., 2003</a>). A\u00a0reduction of five CIN-TCPs targeted by the endogenous microRNA, miR319a (also known as miR-JAW) results in delayed basipetal progression of a mitotic arrest front and increased cell proliferation particularly at leaf margins, producing crinkly and serrated leaves (<a href=\"#bib13\">Efroni et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ori et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Palatnik et al., 2003</a>). Increased distal leaf growth and serrations are also observed when the\u00a0activities of the four NGA transcription factors are reduced (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Trigueros et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarez et al., 2009</a>). The NGAs and CIN-TCPs are co-expressed at many stages of leaf development, exemplified by the\u00a0distal expression of <i>TCP3</i>, <i>TCP4</i>, <i>NGA1</i> and <i>NGA4</i> in young leaves (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and in contrast to the reported expression of <i>miR319</i> at the leaf base (<a href=\"#bib51\">Obayashi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nag et al., 2009</a>). This, together with similarities in their loss-of-function phenotypes, suggests shared roles in leaf development. To investigate functional redundancy, we introduced a constitutive expression construct of miR319a (<i>35S:miR319</i>)\u00a0targeting the five <i>CIN-TCP</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Palatnik et al., 2003</a>) into a quadruple <i>NGA</i> mutant (<i>nga1,2,3,4</i>) that lacks NGA activities."

Indistinguishable phenotypes were observed in plants constitutively expressing both <i>miR319a</i> and the previously characterized artificial miRNA <i>amiR-NGA</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarez et al., 2009</a>), facilitating easier and more extensive characterization of the indeterminate growth phenotype. <i>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</i> plants grow more slowly, are later flowering, and their leaf margins harbor proliferative cell populations unlike those of <i>35S:amiR-NGA</i> and <i>35S:miR319a</i> singly transgenic plants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013G</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s8\">8</a>).

The yellow outline and central numbers are annotations for leaf area analysis using ImageJ (v1.47).

Strong GUS expression occurs during G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. (<b>F</b>) <i>CYCB1;1:GUS</i> expression in wild-type leaf at this stage is more abundant toward the base of the leaf and is comparatively reduced in the distal region. (<b>G</b>) In a similarly aged <i>35S:amiR-NGA</i> leaf <i>CYCB1;1:GUS</i> expression is likewise more abundant toward the base of the leaf but is more frequently observed in the distal domain than in wild-type (arrow).

(<b>I</b>) The distal region of a <i>35S:amiR-NGA</i> leaf showing higher levels of <i>CYCB1;1:GUS</i> expression than wild-type. Expression was quantified as follows: after GUS staining and dissection, three leaves of the total length ranging from 1200 to 1500 \u00b5m were photographed for each genotype. The upper half of each image, as exemplified in <b>F</b>-<b>G</b>, was analyzed. <i>CYCB1;1:GUS</i> expressing area was scored as a percentage of distal leaf area. Whereas 3.2% of the distal leaf area of wild-type constituted <i>CYCB1;1:GUS</i> expression, 9% of the distal region of <i>35S:amiR-NGA</i> leaves comprised <i>CYCB1;1:GUS</i> expression, suggesting that cell divisions in <i>35S:amiR-NGA</i> leaves persist longer. Cell size and cell division measurements show that <i>35S:amiR-NGA</i> plants with\u00a0a compromised expression of all four NGA genes have larger leaves consisting of smaller cells and that prolonged cell division occurs in the distal region of the <i>35S:amiR-NGA</i> leaf.

The index of dissected, older <i>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</i> leaf margins clearly matches that of initiating primordia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). This result is further supported by the\u00a0expression of markers that highlight continued cell division, distinguishing epidermal nuclei (<i>ATML1:H2B-mYFP</i>), epidermal plasma membrane (<i>ATML1:mCitrine-RCI2A</i>), general cell division (<i>CYCB1;1:GFP</i>), initiating trichomes (highlighted by <i>GL2:GFP</i>) and stomatal lineage proliferation (<i>TMM:GUS-GFP</i>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K,L</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>), which demonstrate ongoing leaf-primordium-like activity at the leaf margins. In initiating wild-type leaves, auxin flux, marked by PINFORMED1 (PIN1) expression, converges at the distal\u00a0tip and at serrations, where it inwardly canalizes leaf vascular development, before becoming restricted to proximal margins of older leaves (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bilsborough et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Scarpella et al., 2006</a>). Compared to wild-type leaves, in both <i>35S:amiR-NGA</i> and <i>35S:miR319a</i> individual knockdown leaves auxin flux persists longer at distal leaf margins. Strikingly, in the <i>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</i> combined knockdown leaves, auxin flux continues around the entire leaf margin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1O</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s9\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 9</a>). Auxin canalization and ongoing <i>de novo</i> vasculature morphogenesis at these margins is marked by expression of the provascular makers <i>ATHB8</i> and <i>MONOPTEROS</i> (<i>MP</i>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1M\u2013N</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s10\">10</a>).

However, we found that the cotyledon and/or leaf margins continue to grow in <i>cuc2 cuc3</i> and <i>cuc1 cuc2</i> mutants expressing the <i>35S:miR319a-amiR-NGA</i> transgene.

The respective adaxial, marginal and abaxial genes <i>PHABULOSA</i> (<i>PHB</i>), <i>PRS</i> and <i>KANADI1</i> (<i>KAN1</i>) are expressed in young, wild-type leaf primordia before diminishing in a basipetal fashion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C,E,G\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). At the margins of <i>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</i> leaves, <i>PHB</i>, <i>PRS</i> and <i>KAN1</i> gene expression continues indefinitely, with spatial relationships maintained, implying that in older leaves with reduced CIN-TCP and NGA activities, the collective interplay among these genes is sustained as established in initiating wild-type leaf primordia (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s11\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 11</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To test whether adaxial/abaxial tissue polarity and associated WOX activities are required for marginal leaf growth we examined the effects of mutations in these genes on indeterminate marginal growth. Semi-dominant <i>PHB</i> alleles produce two leaf types on the same plant: partially radialized leaves with distal lamina and completely radialized (adaxialized) leaves (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). In <i>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA phb-1d/+</i> plants, leaves with distal lamina exhibited ectopic marginal growth while radialized leaves did not, demonstrating that ongoing marginal growth first requires the\u00a0juxtaposition of polarity factors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). <i>PRS</i> and <i>WOX1</i> redundantly promote growth as an output of the abaxial/adaxial polarity program (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nakata et al., 2012</a>). The combined loss of NGA and CIN-TCP activities in <i>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</i> plants results in both <i>PRS</i> and <i>WOX1</i> expression occurring as an uninterrupted marginal band in older leaves (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1P</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s11\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 11</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s12\">12</a>). Notably, <i>prs wox1</i> double mutants suppressed the indeterminate marginal growth in <i>35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA</i> plants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K\u2013L</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Hence the ongoing leaf margin growth is dependent on both the polarity program and the leaf-specific <i>WOX</i> genes."

The lack of marginal growth in radialized <i>phb-1d/+</i> organs and its ectopic placement at discrete positions of the lamina when the adaxial/abaxial patterning is compromised argues for a major role of the polarity factors in marginal positioning of a leaf meristem that requires the intervening activity of\u00a0WOX genes. In turn, a negative feedback loop between the marginally restricted meristem and NGA/CIN-TCP activities may lead to the ephemeral nature of this meristem. In agreement, leaves of <i>FIL:WOX1</i> that are likely relieved from such feedback regulation, maintained a highly meristematic nature and failed to differentiate and expand when NGA and CIN-TCP activities were jointly reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>)."

This interpretation is consistent with classical morphological and anatomical studies in which the definition of the marginal meristem was extended to include the entire meristematic leaf primordium at very early stages of leaf development (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hagemann, 1970</a>). If a leaf primoridum is damaged or bifurcated at this stage, nearly complete regeneration of normal leaf morphology is possible (<a href=\"#bib24\">Goebel, 1902</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Figdor, 1906</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Snow and Snow, 1941</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sachs, 1969</a>). Subsequently, as the meristematic regions become restricted to the margins or portions of the margins, damage or bifurcation of the leaf primordium results in progressively more limited regenerative capacity (<a href=\"#bib65\">Snow and Snow, 1941</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sachs, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Figdor, 1926</a>). <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaves are argued to possess a basal meristem that remains transiently active after leaf initiation before transitioning to petiole development \u2014\u00a0a process regulated by the <i>BLADE-ON-PETIOLE</i> (<i>BOP</i>) genes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hepworth et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ichihashi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kuchen et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">Laux et al., 1996</a>).

We thus speculate that variations in lateral organ growth within an individual and among species reflect differential maintenance of meristem activity along the marginal and proximo-distal axes. Remarkable diversity in leaf shape can arise from growth variation along the margin including leaf lobing. Lobe formation in many species relies on leaf-specific activity of class 1 KNOX (KNOX1) genes, which the simple leaves of <i>Arabidopsis</i> lack (<a href=\"#bib54\">Piazza et al., 2010</a>). However, lobes can be mimicked by ectopic KNOX1 expression in <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaves. The radialized leaves of <i>phb-1d/+</i> plants, a <i>prs wox1</i> background and <i>NGA1</i> over-expression, all suppresses the KNOX1-induced lobing phenotype, indicating that an active marginal meristem is a prerequisite to respond to KNOX1 activity (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Sharing of genetic modules implies either common descent or co-option of modules to pattern novel structures. Since seed plant leaves evolved from ancestral shoot systems, common descent is plausible. In this scenario, the leaf meristem module has been modified from an ancestral shoot meristem module to include the leaf-specific <i>WOX1 and\u00a0PRS</i> paralogs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Nardmann and Werr, 2013</a>) that arose in a common ancestor of seed plants. Additional regulators such as the <i>YABBY</i> genes, which are instrumental in lamina growth and restrict activity of SAM factors (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sarojam et al., 2010</a>), and later acting factors limiting leaf meristem activity (i.e., CIN-TCP and NGA) were integrated into the leaf program. Growth suppressors modulating leaf meristem activity were recruited from genes of both ancient and recent origins \u2014 <i>CIN-TCP</i> genes are present in all land plants (<a href=\"#bib50\">Navaud et al., 2007</a>) whereas <i>NGA</i> genes evolved recently, perhaps within seed plants (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarez et al., 2009</a>). Thus the leaf marginal meristem genetic program may have been derived via elaboration of an ancestral shoot program, reflecting the derivation of the leaf from a modified shoot. The identification of such genetic framework provides a unification of how the entire seed plant shoot system is built from apical, vascular, cambial, and leaf meristems that are mechanistically similar. The evolution of seed plant leaves from an ancestral shoot system can be interpreted as evolving via the recruitment of regulatory mechanisms to suppress the morphogenetic potential of the leaf meristem."

The framing of the Introduction and other parts of the paper indicate that the data demonstrate the involvement of marginal meristems in leaf development, and that a longstanding issue is now resolved. Clearly there is proliferation at the leaf edges in the mutant-i.e., a marginal meristem-like proliferation can occur in the mutant background. But as noted below in the specific comments of reviewers, you could interpret the data as a broad failure of the mutant to exit an early leaf margin program of development and progress to the next stage of leaf blade development. Is this early leaf margin program of development really a marginal meristem? I.e., is it rigorously established that this early stage of development really has the attributes of a marginal meristem? For example, evidence that a bona fide meristem exists in the mutant situation could be that WOX genes are of central importance for the proliferation phenotype, which would be similar to what we know for root, shoot and cambium. Is the characterization of the prs wox1 double mutants sufficient to show this? There has been a Plant Cell paper on prs wox1 mutants (<a href=\"http://www.plantcell.org/content/24/2/519.long\">http://www.plantcell.org/content/24/2/519.long</a>); the markers used in this paper are mostly different from the ones in the current paper, and in our view, the authors of the current work do not sufficiently frame their results with respect to phenotypes and conclusions from the Plant Cell paper."

The distinction between a \"marginal\" and \"plate\" meristems has never been clear to me. The paper implies that cells at apex of the margin are not involved, unlike a shoot tip, but we can't find the evidence suggesting that they are only sub-marginal. In fact, it could be argued that loss of elongated epidermal cells from the margin is consistent with gain of meristem characters here. Similarly, might the contribution of cell layers be affected (e.g., might L1 cells divide periclinally at the margin)?"

However, some believe they have not been ruled out earlier in development \u2013 if you define a marginal meristem in terms of undifferentiated, dividing cells close the margin, then most of a small leaf primordium qualifies. The interpretation is therefore that reducing NGA and CIN-TCP activity reveals the existence of a marginal meristem that is normally transient, that this supports an origin of the leaf from a condensed shoot system and that gain of NGA and CIN-TCP activities might have been involved in the condensation."

Much of point 1 is discussed in the literature of the middle of last century, whereby a marginal meristem was defined as including both epidermal cells that divide only anticlinally (an thus producing only abaxial and adaxial epidermis), and sub- epidermal (sub-marginal) cells that divide both anticlinally and periclinally (producing all internal cell layers). The marginal meristem was thought to be restricted to only a few cells at the margin. The loss of differentiated marginal epidermal cells in the NGA/TCP loss-of- function lines is consistent with this view. The plate meristem was defined as being proximal to the margin, extending over a much larger spatial area than the marginal meristem."

We next argue that gradual differentiation imposed by leaf specific programs acts to spatially restrict this meristem to marginal and basal domain. Thus, the marginal leaf meristem does not represent a unique identity, but rather a specific stage during leaf development that can last for different periods in different plants as extensively described by Hagemann and Gleisberg in 1996."

In the NGA/TCP loss-of-function lines, this meristem continues unabated for the life of the plant, but in wild-type plants it is shut down early. Just as in the SAM or root, loss-of-function of the WOX genes results not in a complete loss of growth, but a failure to maintain a pluripotent stem cell population, e.g. wuschel mutants produce a few leaves but the failure to maintain a central zone results in an eventual loss of production of organs from the SAM. In the leaf, loss of wox1 and prs results in an analogous phenotype \u2014 production of a bit of leaf tissue but a failure to maintain continued marginal growth. Thus, prs wox1 mutations are epistatic to the NGA/TCP loss-of-function alleles. Further evidence of the role of these marginal cells comes from an experiment whereby the dimiR-NGA/TCP was driven with the PRS regulatory sequences, which also results in indeterminate meristematic growth at the leaf margin. While a major caveat may include inherent feedbacks, this experiment does suggest that the repression of WOX gene expression at the leaf margin is critical for whole leaf differentiation. Given our knowledge of hormone production in leaf margins, particularly auxin, this observation is not surprising."

This is a new supplemental figure where the miR319a, amiR-NGA and miR-319a-amiR-NGA are expressed under control of the PRS promoter. This is to respond to the reviewers request to see if we can tease out the functions of the genes at the margins versus more internal regions. The microRNAs expressed at the margins via PRS influence growth and give indeterminate leaves in PRS&gt;&gt;miR-319a-amiR-NGA leaves. Notably the internal tissues of PRS&gt;&gt;miR-319a-amiR-NGA leaves do not exhibit the expanded thickness of 35S:miR319a/35S:amiR-NGA leaves suggesting a possible role for the NGATHAs, CIN-TCPs away from the margins may be to regulate cell expansion."

Morphological and marker analyses in cotyledons with reduced CIN-TCP and NGA gene activities from the previous version.
