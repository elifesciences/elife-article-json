The experiments show that T-regulatory cells grown in nutrient-poor conditions in the laboratory activate a protective mechanism known as autophagy. This mechanism recycles damaged or nonessential structures within the cell into nutrients. The Notch receptor is needed to trigger autophagy at the right time and the loss of this receptor causes the cells to die when they are starved of nutrients."

Signaling through Notch1 is obligatory for acquisition of T-cell fate (<a href=\"#bib31\">Radtke et al., 1999</a>). However, Notch signaling is differentially activated during T-cell development and in mature T-cells, including the differentiation of induced Tregs (iTregs) from Foxp3<sup>-ve</sup> naive T-cell precursors (<a href=\"#bib31\">Radtke et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Laky et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Maekawa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yvon et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wolfer et al., 2001</a>). The transcription factor Foxp3 specifies Treg identity and unlike in induced (i)Tregs where Notch1 regulates Foxp3 expression in response to activation cues, in naturally arising Tregs, Foxp3 expression is developmentally regulated (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fontenot et al., 2003</a>). Interestingly, activated Tregs are also distinguished by non-nuclear Notch1 signaling (<a href=\"#bib27\">Perumalsamy et al., 2012</a>)."

In agreement with their central role in coordinating decisions of cell death and survival, mitochondria were a prominent cellular target, responsive to perturbations of the Notch-autophagy cascade. We validate these interactions by reconstituting the Notch-autophagy cascade in Notch1 deficient Tregs. We also show that Notch1 confers cytokine-independence via the activation of autophagy in T-effectors, which are derived from na\u00efve T-cells. The consequence of Notch activity in Treg physiology is assessed in two contexts: One, the suppression of antigen-induced T-cell proliferation and correction of defective glucose clearance in genetically obese mice using adoptive transfers of test Treg populations. Second, the characterization of inflammation and increased activation of T-cell subsets occurring in mice with <i>Notch1</i> ablated in the Foxp3 (Treg) lineage. Collectively, these findings suggest a hitherto unappreciated role for the (non-nuclear) Notch-autophagy axis in the regulation of natural Treg function."

These experiments tested for the involvement of non-nuclear, ligand-dependent Notch1 activity, shown earlier to promote Treg survival (<a href=\"#bib27\">Perumalsamy et al., 2012</a>). A pharmacological inhibitor of the enzyme \u03b3-secretase, (GS inhibitor)-X, inhibits cleavage (S3 cleavage post ligand binding) and release of NIC. Culturing Tregs with GSI-X abrogated survival following cytokine withdrawal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In GSI treated cells, immunestaining for Notch1 showed that that staining was restricted to the cell membrane, confirming that receptor cleavage is disrupted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Further, induction of LC3 puncta was not observed in Tregs cultured with GSI during cytokine withdrawal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), indicating that autophagy is not activated. Earlier work from the laboratory had identified a non-redundant role for the ligand Delta Like Ligand (DLL)-1 in Treg survival. Confirming ligand-dependence, ablation of DLL-1 in Tregs, compromised survival and induction of LC3 puncta in cells cultured without cytokine (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C and D</a>). Contrastingly, but in agreement with published analysis of NIC1 signaling in Tregs, both the induction of LC3 puncta or cytokine-independent survival in Tregs was unchanged following shRNA-mediated ablation of RBPJ-\u03ba, a co-factor of NIC transcription (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). The ablation of RBPJ-\u03ba attenuated expression of Hes1 a target of NIC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) confirming efficacy of shRNA ablation. Taken together, these data suggested that ligand dependent Notch1 activity was required for autophagy and regulation was independent of canonical Notch interactions, such as those requiring RBPJ-\u03ba (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</a>)."

Vps34 and Beclin are known to form multiple and dynamic cellular complexes, which are regulated by the phosphorylation of the proteins themselves as well their interacting partners (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kim et al., 2012</a>). Thus the exclusion of Vps34 from the NIC complex may indicates interactions with proteins (such as Beclin) whose functions may be regulated by Notch activity. The data do not rule out transient associations between NIC and Vps34. That NIC formed complexes with proteins regulating autophagy in Tregs, indicated a more direct role for Notch1 in the autophagic cascade, although the molecular regulation and dynamics of this interaction remains to be dissected."

In this assay, purified na\u00efve (OT-II) T-cells loaded with a fluorescent dye \u2013 chosen because it partitions into daughter cells following division - were injected into host mice, which are subsequently challenged with ovalbumin as OT-II cells respond to this antigen. The OT-II T-cells can be distinguished from host cells by antibody-mediated detection of the CD45.2 molecule on their cell surface (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Three days post antigen challenge lymph node cells are isolated from the host, cells are gated on CD45.2<sup>+</sup> and the CFSE profile scored in this group using two-color flow-cytometry. The distribution of CFSE loaded cells spans multiple dilutions of lower intensity, indicative of proliferation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Ei</a>), whereas in mice not challenged with antigen, CFSE will be detected at the highest intensity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>, filled histogram). Since functional Tregs suppress T-cell proliferation, co-injection of Tregs and CFSE loaded na\u00efve T-cells, results in reduced/no dilution of CFSE (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Eii</a>) following antigen challenge. Thus, the CFSE dilution in antigen-responsive T-cells in a co-injection (adoptive transfer) protocol indicates the percentage of T-cells proliferating in the absence or presence of Tregs. Additionally, by loading Tregs with CFSE and tracking transferred OT-II T-cells by the expression of CD45.2, it can be demonstrated that both the subsets localize to the same lymph node, thereby enabling this analysis (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>)."

Host mice were challenged with the appropriate antigen (mOVA), 15\u201318\u2009hr after receiving cells. Three days post challenge, cells were isolated from draining lymph nodes of host mice and analyzed for CFSE dilution in the gated CD45.2<sup>+</sup> subset donor OT-II T-cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, panel i). In mice co-injected with Tregs transfected with scrambled shRNA, proliferation of OT-II cells was expectedly blunted and CFSE fluorescence in OT-II cells detected at the highest intensity of CFSE indicating an undivided population (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> panel ii).

Thus, the suppressor assay in the culture dish appears to recapitulate a subset of the diverse cues present in vivo.

The assay tracks the clearance of glucose injected into the blood stream of obese mice, and builds on the observation that impaired glucose clearance (also referred to as glucose intolerance) is a feature of obesity (<a href=\"#bib38\">Winer et al., 2009</a>). In this context, the injection of Tregs has been shown to correct defects in the clearance of glucose, although protection is short-term and persists for 10\u201315 days (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cipolletta et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">Feuerer et al.,2009</a>).

Mice with a <i>Notch1</i> ablation, were born in reduced numbers (1:16 as against the expected 1:8 ratio), presented with features consistent with dysregulated immune function and some similarities with <i>Scurfy</i> mice, which lack Tregs because of a loss-of-function mutation in the <i>Foxp3</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fontenot et al., 2003</a>). <i>Foxp3-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox\u00a0</sup></i>mice (analyzed from 4\u20138 weeks of age) were viable, presented with enlarged lymph nodes and increased cellularity relative to <i>Cre</i>-negative littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Increased cellularity resulted from increased numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>low</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> (effector memory) and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>high</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup> (central memory) T-cell subsets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Changes in the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>high</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>+</sup> subsets, which are expressed on Tregs and are early markers of T-cell activation respectively, were inconsistent, showing small increases in number in some mice or remaining comparable to genetic controls in others (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). No striking changes were observed in B-cell and myeloid subsets (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Further, in <i>Foxp3-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox\u00a0</sup></i>mice, which had been injected with WT Tregs, seven days prior to analysis, lymph node inflammation and the number of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets in lymph nodes was substantially reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This suggested that defects in Treg function might contribute to the observed inflammation in <i>Foxp3-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox</sup></i> mice. In preliminary experiments, the adoptive transfer of <i>Notch1</i><sup>-/-\u00a0</sup>Tregs did not reduce lymphoid accumulation (not shown). Notably, several <i>Foxp3-Cre::Notch1<sup>lox/lox\u00a0</sup></i>mice were smaller in size than littermate controls, had shorter, roughened fur and developed crusting of skin around the eyes by 4\u20135 weeks (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). Nonetheless, Foxp3 expression, assessed by immunostaining in Tregs was comparable in mice of the different genotypes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). The analysis of <i>Notch1</i><sup>-/-\u00a0</sup>Tregs in functional assays of inflammation together with the phenotypes of mice with a deletion of <i>Notch1</i> in Tregs suggests an important role for the receptor in immune homeostasis."

The induction of cell death in Tregs in response to cytokine deprivation appeared to correlate with suppressor function in vivo with one exception. The loss of suppressor activity in <i>Notch1</i><sup>-/-\u00a0</sup>Tregs in vivo, did not agree with outcomes of suppressor assays in vitro, wherein Notch1 appeared to be dispensable for Treg suppression (<a href=\"#bib27\">Perumalsamy et al., 2012</a>). Based on the understanding of Notch activity in Tregs we speculate that <i>Notch1<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>Tregs suppress T-cell proliferation in vitro as concentrations of cytokines and growth factors that build up in the dish likely protect <i>Notch1</i><sup>-/-\u00a0</sup>Tregs from death. As Foxp3 levels are not compromised in these cells, this will allow suppressor activity. That the ablation of Vps34 compromised Treg activity in both in vivo and in vitro assays, is consistent with autophagy controlling Treg survival <i>and</i> playing a defining role in maintenance of functional identity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wei et al., 2016</a>), i.e. regulating Foxp3 expression. While we did not detect a loss in Foxp3 expression in the 24\u201348\u2009hr period following ablation of Vps34, the eventual loss of Foxp3 expression and compromised survival as shown by Wei, et al., may underlie defective suppressor activity observed in the 3\u20134 day duration suppressor assays."

Despite defects in <i>Notch1</i><sup>-/-</sup>Treg function, mice with an ablation of Notch1 in mature CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cells did not present overt inflammatory phenotypes, which likely reflect its role in tuning responses of effector T-cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Laky et al., 2015</a>).

The CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells thus isolated were confirmed to be ~95% Foxp3<sup>+</sup> by immune-staining followed by confocal microscopy based analysis across multiple experiments. Cells were activated (~2x10<sup>6</sup>/ml) by co-culturing with beads coated with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 (20ul/ ml; Invitrogen) in 24 well plates. After 48\u2009hr, beads were removed by magnetic separation, and activated Tregs continued in culture in 50% conditioned medium and IL-2 (2\u00a0ng/ml) (R&amp;D; Systems) or used in assays.

In other places, even simple sentences are difficult to understand. For example, in the Results section, the sentence states: \"We next assess if preventing the activation of autophagy was detrimental to cytokine-independent survival\". This sentence is difficult to interpret and perhaps could be more clearly stated as \"We asked whether autophagy is important for survival in the absence of cytokines\"."

A key difference from this study is that our investigation employed natural Tregs activated in vitro, whereas the Charbonnier group has characterized natural Tregs cells in circulation. The study by Jun Wei et al. (Nat Immunol., 2016, 17:277-286), mapsevents at the earlier stages of Treg activation to define a critical role for autophagy during differentiation of Tregs.

We posit that the inflammation observed in Foxp3Notch1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, results from a breakdown of tolerance and a response to antigens experienced in these conditions. Importantly, genetic (littermate) controls were indistinguishable from wild type mice arguing against overt infection. Interestingly, the phenotypes of autoimmunity reported in Atg7 deficient mice (Nat Immunol., 2016, 17:277-286), are aligned with our observations of lymphoid proliferation and increased numbers of recently activated or memory T-cells in Foxp3Notch1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The interaction between Notch and autophagy revealed in our experiments suggests an hitherto unappreciated for Notch signaling in the regulation of this process. Whether this interaction is conserved at all stages of Treg activation remains to be investigated."

Vps34 and Beclin are known to form multiple and dynamic cellular complexes, which are regulated by the phosphorylation of the proteins themselves as well their interacting partners (Kang et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2012). Thus the exclusion of Vps34 from the NIC complex reveals specific interactions with proteins (such as Beclin) whose functions may be regulated by Notch activity. The data also do not rule out transient associations between NIC and Vps34. The data support the evidence of Notch interactions with autophagy intermediates, but the functional significance of specific or dynamic complexes that include Notch remains to be investigated further."
