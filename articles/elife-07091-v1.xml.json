Wnt ligands trigger signaling by activating Frizzled receptors (FZDRs), which belong to the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily. However, the mechanisms of G protein activation in Wnt signaling remain controversial. In this study, we demonstrate that FZDRs activate G proteins and trigger non-canonical Wnt signaling via the Dishevelled-binding protein, Daple. Daple contains a G\u03b1-binding and activating (GBA) motif, which activates G\u03b1i proteins and an adjacent domain that directly binds FZDRs, thereby linking Wnt stimulation to G protein activation. This triggers non-canonical Wnt responses, that is, suppresses the \u03b2-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway and tumorigenesis, but enhances PI3K-Akt and Rac1 signals and tumor cell invasiveness. In colorectal cancers, Daple is suppressed during adenoma-to-carcinoma transformation and expressed later in metastasized tumor cells. Thus, Daple activates G\u03b1i and enhances non-canonical Wnt signaling by FZDRs, and its dysregulation can impact both tumor initiation and progression to metastasis."

Wnt ligands trigger signaling by activating Frizzled receptors (FZDRs), which belong to the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily. However, the mechanisms of G protein activation in Wnt signaling remain controversial. In this study, we demonstrate that FZDRs activate G proteins and trigger non-canonical Wnt signaling via the Dishevelled-binding protein, Daple. Daple contains a G\u03b1-binding and activating (GBA) motif, which activates G\u03b1i proteins and an adjacent domain that directly binds FZDRs, thereby linking Wnt stimulation to G protein activation. This triggers non-canonical Wnt responses, that is, suppresses the \u03b2-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway and tumorigenesis, but enhances PI3K-Akt and Rac1 signals and tumor cell invasiveness. In colorectal cancers, Daple is suppressed during adenoma-to-carcinoma transformation and expressed later in metastasized tumor cells. Thus, Daple activates G\u03b1i and enhances non-canonical Wnt signaling by FZDRs, and its dysregulation can impact both tumor initiation and progression to metastasis."

A system called Wnt signaling allows cells in different tissues to communicate. During Wnt signaling, one cell releases a protein called Wnt that then binds to a receptor protein known as Frizzled on the surface of another cell. This triggers a cascade of signaling events in the second cell, which leads to changes in the activity of particular genes. Wnt signaling is vital to many processes in cells, and any defects can cause cancer and other severe diseases."

Other Wnts, for example, Wnt5a deviate from this canonical paradigm, and trigger so-called non-canonical pathways (<a href=\"#bib61\">K\u00fchl et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Niehrs, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib137\">Winklbauer et al., 2001</a>). Among other events, these non-canonical pathways induce the elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and activation of the small G proteins RhoA and Rac1, which regulate polarized cell movements and the planar polarity of epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib110\">Sheldahl et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">K\u00fchl et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Mayor and Theveneau, 2014</a>).

These receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which classically activate trimeric G proteins. However, the interplay between FZDR and G proteins in Wnt signaling is very controversial\u2014on one hand, there is a wealth of evidence indicating that trimeric G proteins regulate Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib80\">Malbon, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Katanaev et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Liu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Schulte and Bryja, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Koval et al., 2011</a>). On the other hand, definitive evidence for the direct activation of trimeric G proteins by FZDR's is elusive. The experimental difficulties and controversies in the field have led to provocative speculations that FZDRs may not bind G proteins directly, but do so indirectly via other intermediates within the Wnt signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib107\">Schulte and Bryja, 2007</a>), but such intermediate \u2018linker\u2019 molecules have not been identified. Recent advances in the field of trimeric G protein signaling have important implications in this regard. It has become increasingly clear that the activity of trimeric G proteins is regulated by a plethora of accessory proteins (<a href=\"#bib112\">Siderovski and Willard, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Sato et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Blumer and Lanier, 2014</a>) beyond classical activation by GPCRs. Among these accessory proteins, a subset of proteins called non-receptor Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) are uniquely positioned to fulfill the role of an intermediate to trigger G protein signaling upon Wnt stimulation because they are cytoplasmic factors capable of activating G proteins (<a href=\"#bib121\">Tall et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Lanier, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Natochin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Lee and Dohlman, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Oner et al., 2013</a>)."

We demonstrate that a novel G protein regulatory motif enables Daple to couple G protein activation to FZDRs, which in turn initiates non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. We also demonstrate how bimodal dysregulation in Daple expression modulates non-canonical Wnt signaling during cancer progression."

We showed that GIV binds and activates G\u03b1 subunits of the Gi subfamily via its GBA motif and regulates signal transduction. GIV is one of the 3 members of the CCDC88 family, which have in common an N-terminal HOOK domain followed by a long coiled-coil region but are highly divergent in their C-terminal region (<a href=\"#bib65\">Le-Niculescu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Enomoto et al., 2006</a>): CCDC88b (aka GIPIE) completely lacks this C-terminal region, whereas the C-terminal region of CCDC88c (aka Daple) shows significant divergence (15% identity, 26% similarity) compared to CCDC88a's (i.e., GIV) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The divergence in the C-terminal sequence allows CCDC88 proteins to associate with different proteins and regulate diverse biological processes (<a href=\"#bib65\">Le-Niculescu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Enomoto et al., 2006</a>), for example, a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) is found exclusively in Daple, at its extreme C-terminus, which binds the PDZ domain of Dvl and regulates Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib98\">Oshita et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Kobayashi et al., 2005</a>). Despite these apparent sequence differences among CCDC88 family members, a more detailed analysis of the C-terminal sequences of GIV and Daple from different vertebrate species revealed a cryptic GBA motif in Daple localized within the otherwise highly divergent C-terminal region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This putative GBA motif (aa 1668\u20131683) in Daple shares a high degree of similarity to previously reported GBA motifs found in proteins (<a href=\"#bib34\">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2011b</a>) and synthetic peptides (<a href=\"#bib50\">Johnston et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Austin et al., 2008</a>) with GEF activity towards G\u03b1i proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). As a first step to investigate the functionality of this GBA motif, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments, which revealed that full-length endogenous Daple in HEK293 cells interacts with the trimeric G protein G\u03b1i3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We next investigated if the interaction between Daple and G proteins presents the biochemical properties previously reported for other GBA motif sequences, that is, they bind directly to the G protein with submicromolar to low-micromolar affinity when it is in the inactive but not active conformation (<a href=\"#bib121\">Tall et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ghosh et al., 2008</a>). Recombinant purified GST-G\u03b1i3 bound robustly to purified His-Daple CT (aa 1650\u20132028, containing the GBA motif) when loaded with GDP (inactive) but not when loaded with GDP/AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> or GTP\u03b3S (both mimic the GTP-bound active G protein) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Equivalent results were obtained when lysates of mammalian cells expressing full-length Daple were used in the pulldown assays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Binding of His-G\u03b1i3-GDP to GST-Daple CT was saturable, and fitting of the data to a one-site binding curve revealed a submicromolar equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd = 0.11 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5M, n = 4), indicating a slightly higher affinity of the G protein for Daple than for GIV (Kd = 0.24 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5M, n = 4) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>)."

We found that this is also the case for Daple because it interacts with G\u03b1i1, G\u03b1i2, and G\u03b1i3 (although binding to G\u03b1i2 is partially reduced compared to G\u03b1i1 and G\u03b1i3) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) but not with G\u03b1o (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Despite these biochemical properties shared with related GBA motifs, we found that binding of Daple to G\u03b1i has unique structural determinants that differentiate it from other proteins with a GBA motif, that is, GIV and Calnuc. We found that mutants of G\u03b1i3 that were previously shown (<a href=\"#bib33\">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2011b</a>) to be incapable of binding to GIV or Calnuc (i.e., W258F or K248M, respectively) retain their ability to bind Daple (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This result indicates that the Daple\u2013G\u03b1i3 interface has unique molecular features that provide specificity by making it different from other GBA motif-G protein interactions."

                                "text": "To gain insights into the interface between Daple and G\u03b1i proteins, we took advantage of the previously published atomic structure of KB-752, a synthetic GEF peptide similar to the GBA motif (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), in complex with G\u03b1i1 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Johnston et al., 2005</a>). We used this structure as a template to build a homology model of the complex between the GBA motif of Daple and G\u03b1i3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Our first prediction based on this model was that Daple would bind to a hydrophobic cleft on the G protein located between the switch II (SwII) region and the \u03b13 helix. This seemed to be the case because two molecules known to bind onto the SwII/\u03b13 cleft, that is, the synthetic GEF peptide KB-752 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and His-GIV-CT (aa 1660\u20131870, containing its GEF motif) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), competed with His-Daple-CT for binding to GST-G\u03b1i3. We further substantiated the identity of the binding pocket using site-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of our homology model suggested that a major molecular contact is established by the hydrophobic interaction between the aromatic residues W211 and F215 located in the SwII region of G\u03b1i3 and Daple's F1675 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Binding of His-Daple-CT to GST-G\u03b1i3 was dramatically impaired upon mutation of W211 or F215 to Alanine (Ala; A) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), indicating that these hydrophobic residues of the SwII/\u03b13 cleft serve as a docking site for Daple. Importantly, W211A and F215A mutations have been previously shown not to disturb the native biochemical properties of G\u03b1i proteins (<a href=\"#bib122\">Thomas et al., 2004</a>), and therefore, their inability to bind Daple is not a consequence of an overall defect in G protein folding or function. Furthermore, mutation of Daple's F1675, the residue in its GBA motif predicted to interact with W211 and F215 of the G protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) to Ala abolished GST-G\u03b1i3 binding to either recombinant His-Daple-CT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) or full-length myc-Daple expressed in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Equivalent results were obtained in co-IP experiments in that binding of full-length myc-Daple and G\u03b1i3 co-expressed in mammalian cells was dramatically impaired upon mutation of F1675 to A (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; henceforth referred to as FA). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Daple utilizes its GBA motif to bind onto the SwII/\u03b13 hydrophobic cleft of G\u03b1i3."

To this end, we analyzed activation of G\u03b1i in HeLa cells expressing Daple-WT or FA using an anti-G\u03b1i:GTP mAb that specifically recognizes G\u03b1i in a GTP-bound active conformation (<a href=\"#bib62\">Lane et al., 2008a</a>). Previous work by others (<a href=\"#bib62\">Lane et al., 2008a</a>) and by us (<a href=\"#bib76\">Lopez-Sanchez et al., 2014</a>) has demonstrated that this antibody can specifically recognize active G\u03b1i in cells. When we immunoprecipitated G\u03b1i from HeLa cells, active G\u03b1i3 was immunoprecipitated exclusively after Wnt5a stimulation in cells expressing Daple-WT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2M</a>), but not in those expressing Daple-FA. These results indicate that an intact GBA motif is essential for Daple to activate G\u03b1i3 after Wnt5a stimulation. To further substantiate this, we determined the intracellular levels of cAMP as a measure of the activity of adenylyl cyclase, which is directly inhibited by active G\u03b1i subunits. We found that Wnt5a stimulation suppressed cAMP levels by \u223c50% in HeLa cells expressing Daple-WT, but no such suppression occurred in cells expressing Daple-FA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2N</a>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Daple is a <i>bona fide</i> GEF that activates G\u03b1i proteins in vitro and in cells responding to Wnt5a via its GBA motif."

Comparative analysis of the crystal structure of the G\u03b1i1\u00b7\u03b2\u03b3 trimer and the homology model of Daple's GBA motif bound to G\u03b1i3 revealed that G\u03b2\u03b3 and Daple have overlapping binding sites on G\u03b1i subunits (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Based on this, we reasoned that binding of Daple to G\u03b1i will displace G\u03b2\u03b3 from trimeric G\u03b1i\u00b7\u03b2\u03b3 complexes. We found that is indeed the case because His-Daple-CT WT, but not the FA mutant (which cannot bind G\u03b1i), displaced G\u03b2\u03b3 from a pre-assembled complex with GST-G\u03b1i3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

We first carried out GST pulldown assays with recombinant His-G\u03b1i3 and the GST-tagged cytoplasmic tail of FZD7R. We found that G\u03b1i3 bound weakly to GST-FZD7R-CT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; lane 2); however, binding was increased \u223cfivefold in the presence of recombinant Daple-CT WT, but not the FA mutant. This raised the possibility that the ligand-dependent interaction between G\u03b1i and FZD7 we see in cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) is indirect and mediated by the GBA motif in Daple. Indeed, ligand-dependent recruitment of G\u03b1i3 to FZD7R occurred exclusively in cells expressing full-length Daple-WT (where GBA motif is intact), but not the FA mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Next, the spatiotemporal dynamics of ligand-dependent complex formation between FZD7R and G\u03b1i3 was analyzed in HEK293 cells by FRET imaging (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). We found that the probe-pair FZD7R-CFP and G\u03b1i3-YFP interact at the PM within 5 min after ligand stimulation (FRET efficiency = 0.25 \u00b1 0.06) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,I</a>). No such interaction was observed in starved cells (FRET efficiency = 0.04 \u00b1 0.01), demonstrating that Wnt5a triggers the assembly of complexes between ligand-activated FZD7R and G\u03b1i3 at the PM. Furthermore, ligand-dependent assembly of such complexes occurred in cells expressing Daple-WT, but not the FA mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J,K</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), further confirming that Daple serves as in intermediate protein that couples FZD7R to G\u03b1i3. Although the interaction between ligand-activated FZD7R and Daple does not require the GBA motif (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), the recruitment of G\u03b1i into the complex requires a functionally intact GBA to trigger the formation of FZD7R(active)-Daple-G\u03b1i complexes. Thus, two non-overlapping modules in-tandem within Daple's C-terminus cooperate to facilitate the assembly of FZD7R(active)-Daple-G\u03b1i ternary complexes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L</a>)\u2014(1) a GBA motif that binds G\u03b1i and (2) a stretch of C-terminus (aa 1681\u20132024) is essential for binding to FZD7R."

Furthermore, Dvl interferes with the engagement of Gi proteins with ligand-activated FZDRs (<a href=\"#bib54\">Kilander et al., 2014</a>), suggesting a possible interplay between Dvl and the FZDR-Daple-Gi signaling axis we define here. First, we investigated how the ligand-dependent Daple-FZD7R interaction affects Dvl's ability to bind Daple. We found that Daple co-immunoprecipitated with Dvl exclusively in starved cells and that such complexes were undetectable after stimulation with Wnt5a (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), indicating that the dissociation of Daple-Dvl complexes coincides with the assembly of Daple-FZD7R complexes we observed in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. Next, we investigated how Daple affects the interaction between Dvl and FZDR. We found that expression of Daple in HEK293 cells reduces Dvl association with FZD7R in pulldown (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and co-IP experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), suggesting that Daple and Dvl may compete with each other for binding to FZD7R. Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies confirmed that localization of Dvl at the PM in cells expressing FZD7R was reduced within 5 min after Wnt5a stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), which coincides with the ligand-dependent recruitment of Daple (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We found that Daple and Dvl actually compete for binding to FZD7R because increasing amounts of purified His-Daple-CT (1650\u20132028), but not a shorter fragment (His-Daple 1650\u20131880, which lacks the FZD7R-binding region) increased the formation of Daple-FZDR complexes and reduced DvlFZD7R complexes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies revealed, that in cells without Daple, stimulation with Wnt5a does not trigger the loss of Dvl from the PM observed in control cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), suggesting that the competition we observe in vitro (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) may occur also in cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Daple determines the relocalization of Dvl upon Wnt5a stimulation by displacing the latter from FZDRs."

Upon ligand stimulation, Dvl-Daple complexes dissociate and Daple is recruited to the cytoplasmic tails of activated receptors, Dvl is displaced from the receptor tail by Daple, Daple favors the assembly of receptor-G\u03b1i complexes and triggers the activation of G\u03b1i within these complexes. Activated G\u03b1i and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits trigger signaling via their respective downstream intermediates (Rac1, PI3K, and cAMP). Another major consequence of these signaling events is suppression of the canonical \u03b2-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling pathway, which regulates the transcription of Wnt target genes."

(<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>) Control (Luc shRNA) or Daple-depleted (Daple shRNA) HeLa cells were cotransfected with G\u03b1i1-YFP, G\u03b2-CFP, and untagged G\u03b3, serum starved overnight (0.2% FBS) and subsequently stimulated with either Wnt3 and analyzed for FRET by confocal microscopy. Representative freeze-frame images from live-cell movies are shown (<b>A</b>), which display intensities of acceptor emission due to FRET in each pixel. Activation of Gi was insignificant, as determined by continued interaction (i.e., continued FRET) between G\u03b1i1 and G\u03b21\u03b32 both before and after Wnt3 stimulation (compare t0 and t5) both in control (Luc shRNA) and in Daple-depleted HeLa cells.

Error bars representing mean \u00b1 S.D. of 5 randomly chosen ROIs at the PM per cell, from 2 to 3 cells per experiment, from three independent experiments. These results are in striking contrast to the findings after Wnt5a stimulation (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I\u2013L</a> in manuscript). (<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>) Control (Luc shRNA) or Daple-depleted (Daple shRNA) HeLa cells were serum-starved (0.2% FBS) and treated (+) or not (\u2212) with Wnt3 (<b>C</b>) or Wnt5a (<b>D</b>) for 15 min prior to lysis. Equal aliquots of lists were subjected to IP with antibodies that selectively recognize active G\u03b1i subunits in their GTP-bound state. Immune complexes (top) and lysates (bottom) were analyzed for active G\u03b1i3:GTP and total G\u03b1i3 by IB. Wnt5a robustly activates G\u03b1i3, and this activation is abolished upon Daple depletion, whereas Wnt3 marginally activates G\u03b1i3 and this activation is not diminished upon Daple depletion. (<b>E</b>) Myc-Daple is translocated to the PM after Wnt5a, but not after Wnt3 stimulation. HeLa cells were transfected with myc-tagged Daple-WT, serum starved overnight (0.2% FBS) and subsequently stimulated with either Wnt5a or Wnt3 as indicated. Cells were fixed at 5 min after ligand stimulation and analyzed for localization of myc-Daple (Green) by immunofluorescence. Myc-Daple was found in cytosolic distribution prior to ligand stimulation in starved cells. Upon stimulation with Wnt5a Daple was found to localize sharply at the PM. Upon stimulation with Wnt3 myc-Daple remained in cytosolic location. (<b>F</b>) Endogenous Daple is translocated to the PM after Wnt5a, but not after Wnt3 stimulation. HEK cells transfected with CFP-tagged FZD7R were serum starved for 24 hr (0% FBS), and subsequently stimulated with either Wnt5a or Wnt3 as indicated. Cells were fixed at 5 min after ligand stimulation and analyzed for localization of endogenous Daple by immunofluorescence. Daple was found in cytosolic distribution prior to ligand stimulation in starved cells (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Upon stimulation with Wnt3, Daple remained in cytosolic location, however, upon stimulation with Wnt5a Daple was found to localize at the PM, where it colocalized with FZD7R (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

Equal aliquots of cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed for \u03b2 Catenin, Daple, and tubulin by IB. \u03b2 Catenin was stabilized (increased, compare even lanes with odd lanes) in each condition tested, without significant differences between Daple-WT vs Daple-FA at any time points observed.

In in vitro competition assays with recombinant proteins, we found that binding between Daple and Dvl was reduced with increasing amounts of His-G\u03b1i3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). No such reduction was noted when the Daple-CT-WT was replaced by the GBA-deficient FA mutant (that cannot bind G proteins) in the above assays. These findings indicate that G\u03b1i3 competes with Dvl for binding to Daple-CT, and that an intact GBA motif is essential for such competition. Together, these results suggest that the G\u03b1i-Daple and Daple-FZD7R interactions we describe here have at least two major effects on the interplay between Daple, Dvl, and FZD7R: (1) Daple and Dvl compete for binding to the C-terminus of FZD7R and (2) G\u03b1i and Dvl compete for binding to the C-terminus of Daple. Consequently, stimulation with Wnt5a triggers the dissociation of Daple-Dvl and FZD7R-Dvl complexes and favors the assembly of FZD7R-Daple-G\u03b1i signaling complexes at the PM in detriment of FZD7R-Dvl complexes."

Prior studies have demonstrated that activation of G proteins downstream of FZDRs is sufficient for antagonistic suppression of \u03b2-catenin-dependent signaling (<a href=\"#bib114\">Slusarski et al., 1997a</a>, <a href=\"#bib115\">1997b</a>). Others have implicated binding of Dvl to FZDRs is required for the enhancement of the \u03b2-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway of signaling (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gao and Chen, 2010</a>). We asked if activation of G proteins via Daple's GBA motif may antagonize \u03b2-catenin stability/signaling. We found that HeLa cells without Daple (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>) or those expressing the GEF-deficient Daple FA mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>) had increased levels of \u03b2-catenin protein compared to respective controls, indicating that Daple and its GBA motif are required for maintenance of low levels of \u03b2-catenin, and that in their absence \u03b2-catenin is stabilized. Consistently, increased stability of \u03b2-catenin was also associated with enhanced transcription of downstream target genes SFRP-1, Osteopontin, and Axin-2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J\u2013L</a>). Similar results were obtained when we analyzed the \u03b2-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway in DLD1 colon cancer cells stably expressing Daple-WT or FA mutant (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) using 7-TGP, an eGFP expressing Wnt activity reporter construct (<a href=\"#bib29\">Fuerer and Nusse, 2010</a>). Wnt activity was enhanced in cells expressing Daple-FA, but not Daple-WT (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), consistent with our prior findings in HeLa cells. Finally, we found that Daple specifically functions within the non-canonical Wnt signaling cascade and not within the canonical Wnt pathway, for example, stimulation of the canonical Wnt pathway with Wnt3a did not require Daple to activate Gi (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>), did not trigger the recruitment of Daple to the PM (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2E,F</a>), and did not affect the stabilization of \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2G</a>). These results suggest that the repressive effects of Daple we observe on the \u03b2-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J\u2013L</a>) are likely due to enhancement of the antagonistic non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway."

We first analyzed the cellular phenotypes that are modulated by Wnt5a and non-canonical Wnt signaling during different stages of cancer progression (<a href=\"#bib83\">McDonald and Silver, 2009</a>). In the normal mucosa, this pathway serves as a tumor-suppressor, by antagonizing the canonical Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib125\">Torres et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">MacLeod et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib143\">Ying et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib144\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chien et al., 2009</a>), whereas in advanced tumors it triggers cell migration/invasion by enhancing PI3K-Akt and Rac1 pathways and the formation of actin stress fibers (<a href=\"#bib93\">Nishita et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib145\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>).

To determine if Daple can trigger cell invasion through basement membrane proteins, we carried out 3-D matrigel invasion assays. Non-invasive NIH3T3 cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Albini et al., 1987</a>) stably expressing Daple-WT, Daple-FA, or vector control were grown into tumor spheroids and subsequently analyzed for cell invasion through matrix (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). Enhanced invasion (as determined by the area of invasion; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) was detected exclusively in the presence of Daple-WT, but not in cells expressing control vector or Daple-FA, indicating that Daple is sufficient to trigger cell invasion, and that a functionally intact GBA motif is essential. Compared to cells expressing Daple-FA, those expressing Daple-WT had significantly higher expression of Lox-L3 and Vimentin, two genes commonly associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>), indicating that higher invasiveness was accompanied by an EMT gene signature."

For this, we used three cell lines: HeLa cell lines, the constitutively active Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells, and the DLD1 colorectal cancer cells in which transformation is driven by hyperactive \u03b2-catenin signaling in addition to active Ras mutations. We chose to study DLD1 colorectal cancer cells because Daple is virtually undetectable in these cells compared to normal colon (data not shown), thereby allowing us to reconstitute expression exogenously and analyze the effect of WT and mutant Daple constructs without significant interference due to the endogenous protein. Expression of Daple-WT reduced the number of colonies formed by Ras-transformed NIH3T3 in soft-agar by \u223c65% (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicating that Daple's GBA motif is required for suppressing neoplastic transformation. The mitotic index, as determined by the presence of phosphorylated Histone H3 in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib42\">Hans and Dimitrov, 2001</a>), was higher in HeLa cells expressing Daple-FA compared to those expressing Daple-WT (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), indicating that Daple's GBA motif suppresses mitosis. When we assessed the tumor-suppressive effect of Wnt5a on HeLa cells in anchorage-dependent tumor growth assays, we found that tumor growth was suppressed in the control cells, but such suppression was lost in cells depleted of endogenous Daple (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This loss of tumor-suppressive effect of Wnt5a was restored by expressing Daple-WT but not by expressing the Daple-FA mutant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), indicating that a functionally intact GBA motif in Daple is essential for Wnt5a to exert its tumor suppressive effects. Daple-WT also inhibited anchorage-independent tumor growth of DLD1 cells by \u223c50% (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013F</a>), and inhibited anchorage-dependent tumor growth of DLD1 cells by \u223c90% (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>), demonstrating that Daple suppresses cellular transformation and growth across all assays. This tumor suppressive effect was mediated via the GBA motif because, compared to Daple-WT, expression of Daple-FA not only failed to inhibit cell transformation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and growth (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,H</a>) but also enhanced oncogenicity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Noteworthy, expression of a Daple mutant that cannot bind Dvl (Daple-\u0394PBM) but has an intact GBA motif retained the tumor suppressive properties of Daple-WT across all assays, whereas a mutant that lacks both the GBA and the Dvl-binding PBM motifs (Daple-2M) mirrored the phenotype of the FA mutant, indicating that the G protein regulatory GBA motif, and not the Dvl-binding PBM motif is essential for the tumor suppressive function of Daple. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Daple inhibits cell transformation and proliferation during tumor growth, but enhances cell motility and cytoskeletal remodeling during invasion; both require the GBA motif, which regulates G protein activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I</a>)."

Modulation of G protein activity by Daple's GBA motif is a key determinant of cellular phenotype(s) triggered by Wnt5a. In cells expressing Daple-WT, a functionally intact GBA motif (+) can activate G\u03b1i, enhance PM-based motogenic signals (PI3K-Akt and Rac1 activation), trigger EMT and cell migration/invasion. In cells expression Daple-FA, without the functional GBA motif (\u2212) G protein remains inactive, non-canonical Wnt signaling is suppressed, which increases stability of \u03b2-catenin and upregulation of Wnt target genes, resulting in increased transformation, proliferation, and tumor cell growth."

Analysis of several publicly available microarray databases revealed expression of Daple mRNA was reduced by \u223ctwofold in adenocarcinomas of the colon or rectum compared to matched normals (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 1</a>). When we analyzed Daple mRNA in another cohort of patients by quantitative PCR (qPCR), we confirmed that Daple is indeed downregulated in cancers (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), but not in the precancerous advanced polyps (defined as any adenoma with &gt;25% villous features, or \u22651.0 cm in size, or high-grade dysplasia); the latter showed a modest upregulation in Daple mRNA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). This suggests that the suppression of Daple is fairly late during oncogenesis coinciding with late adenoma-to-cancer progression. Meta-analysis of various microarray databases at The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; <a href=\"http://www.cancergenome.nih.gov\">www.cancergenome.nih.gov</a>) further revealed that expression of Daple mRNA is significantly suppressed in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal tumors, which account for \u223c85% of all colorectal cancers and are characterized by the presence of chromosomal instability (CIN) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 2</a>), whereas tumors with high degree of microsatellite instability (MSI-high) express at levels similar to normal colon (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Among MSS tumors, the degree of suppression of Daple correlated with the degree of CIN (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Furthermore, as shown previously in the case of other tumor suppressors (<a href=\"#bib101\">Pino and Chung, 2010</a>), we found that suppression of Daple mRNA in the primary tumors at the time of diagnosis was associated with disease progression, as determined by formation of distant metastasis in a cohort of patients with stage II colorectal cancers (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Taken together, these results indicate that expression of Daple is frequently reduced during oncogenesis, that such reduction is more common in the setting of CIN, and that reduced expression of Daple in primary tumors may predict disease progression."

Microarray data from GSE <i>database</i> (PMID: 18843029, GSE: 10,715) were analyzed for Daple mRNA expression in peripheral blood samples of healthy subjects (n = 11) and of 121 patients with early (Dukes <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>) or late (Duke's <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>) stages of colorectal cancer.

No significant differences were observed in the CD45 levels between two groups (<i>not shown</i>). (<b>I</b>, <b>J</b>) High levels of Daple mRNA expression in CTCs are associated with poorer progression-free (PFS; <b>I</b>) and overall (OS; <b>J</b>) survival in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Optimal cut-off values for Daple mRNA expression were statistically derived (see detailed \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) to generate subgroups of patients with high- or low-expression levels.

Degree of upregulation (green) or downregulation (red) in Daple mRNA is indicated by increasing shades of each color during the normal-to-adenoma-to-carcinoma progression in the colon is shown. (<b>L</b>) Proposed model for how a bimodal dysregulation of tumor suppressor Daple, and resultant deregulation of non-canonical Wnt signaling may propel oncogenic progression in the colon. Daple's ability to modulate G proteins via its GBA motif exerts a potent tumor suppressive effect in the normal mucosa. Early during oncogenesis (top, from left to right), downregulation of Daple (marked by \u2018X\u2019) occurs at the step of adenoma to cancer conversion, in part by DNA copy loss (bottom) due to focal deletion affecting the long arm of Chr 14. Consequently, low expression of Daple mRNA and protein triggers transformation and tumor growth/progression. Later during cancer invasion, expression of Daple is triggered via unknown mechanisms, which favors (green arrow) tumor recurrence and prognosticates poor survival."

We provide biochemical and in-cellulo evidence for the presence of a GBA motif that activates G\u03b1i and an independent domain within the C-terminal region of Daple, which directly binds the cytoplasmic tail of FZDRs. Such a coexistence allows Daple to link G protein activation to ligand-activated FZDRs within ternary FZDR-Daple-G\u03b1i complexes at the PM. We also demonstrate that FZDRs and G\u03b1i come within close proximity of each other (\u223c10 nm based on FRET imaging studies) within these complexes, suggesting a direct interaction between them on the Daple platform. In cells without Daple, or in cells expressing a mutant in which the GBA motif is selectively disrupted, FZDRs and G proteins do not approach each other and G protein is not activated, demonstrating an obligatory role for Daple's GBA motif in the assembly of FZDR-G\u03b1i complexes. These findings provide a new perspective on the role of G proteins in Wnt signaling because previous work has widely debated the fundamental question whether the 7-TM FZDRs can directly bind and activate G proteins. Arguments that have favored the classification of FZDRs as GPCRs are supported by experimental evidence that FZDRs indeed signal via G proteins, for example, structure-based bioinformatic prediction, pertussis toxin sensitive signaling pathways, genetic linkage with G proteins, and ability to bind \u03b2-arrestin for subsequent internalization (<a href=\"#bib114\">Slusarski et al., 1997a</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Liu et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ahumada et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Katanaev et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gao and Wang, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Ma and Wang, 2006</a>). Arguments that refute such classification highlight the lack of direct experimental proof of G-protein interaction with FZDRs, and that most studies use experimental models (overexpressed receptors or gain-of-function), which do not necessarily implicate necessity (<a href=\"#bib107\">Schulte and Bryja, 2007</a>). Our work breaks the impasse in the field by the discovery of an alternative mechanism of G protein activation by FZDRs: we propose that the C-terminus of Daple is the long sought molecular linker that couples FZDRs to efficient G protein activation by virtue of its ability to simultaneously bind receptors and activate G proteins. However, that some FZDRs may directly couple with other G proteins under certain circumstances cannot be ruled out (see below)."

We demonstrated that Daple activates Gi via a signature sequence, that is, the GBA motif that allows proteins and synthetic peptides to exert GEF activity on G proteins and provides a structural basis for non-receptor mediated activation of G proteins (<a href=\"#bib50\">Johnston et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Austin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2011b</a>). Daple shares overall homology with GIV, the prototype GBA motif-containing protein, and both of them are classified as members of the CCDC88 family. Interestingly, the C-terminal domains of these two proteins, in which their conserved GBA motifs are located, share very little overall similarity. These observations suggest that Daple and GIV arose from a common ancestor protein and that the GBA function was selectively preserved, while the rest of the C-terminal domain diverged in evolution."

The GEF activity of Daple, that is, its ability to accelerate the exchange of nucleotide, is more robust than that previously reported for FZDRs in similar in vitro assays (\u223c2.5\u20133-fold activation compared to \u223c1.5-fold) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Koval and Katanaev, 2011</a>). Inefficient activation of G proteins by FZDRs (\u223c5\u201320% efficacy compared to that observed for a \u2018classical\u2019 GPCR, i.e., Adenosine 2B receptor) has also been documented in yeast (<a href=\"#bib90\">Nichols et al., 2013</a>), which lack homologues of Daple. Our studies measuring G protein activation in Daple-depleted cells or in cells without a functional GBA motif in Daple help establish an obligatory role of Daple as a <i>bona fide</i> G protein activator, which enables FZDRs to indirectly activate Gi to robust levels. These findings cannot rule out other possibilities, for example, that FZDRs may directly activate Gi to a lesser extent under certain circumstances, or that Daple and FZDRs may activate different subsets of G proteins. The latter possibility is exemplified by G\u03b1o, which has been most widely reported as a target for FZDRs (<a href=\"#bib73\">Liu et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib72\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Katanaev et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bikkavilli et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Katanaev and Buestorf, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Egger-Adam and Katanaev, 2010</a>) but not for Daple (this work). The marked preference of Daple for \u03b1-subunits of the Gi family is a common feature shared with previously described GBA proteins; Daple, GIV, Calnuc, NUCB2 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2011b</a>), or the synthetic peptides KB-752 and GSP (<a href=\"#bib50\">Johnston et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Austin et al., 2008</a>) can exquisitely distinguish between G\u03b1i and G\u03b1o proteins, despite their being closely related and sharing 75% sequence homology."

Daple can bind to two G\u03b1i3 mutants, W258F and K248M, that abolish binding to GIV and Calnuc, respectively. Moreover, we have previously shown (<a href=\"#bib33\">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2011b</a>) that these mutants are able to discriminate between GIV and Calnuc (K248M binds GIV, but not Calnuc, and W258F binds Calnuc, but not GIV), which further suggest that different GBA-G\u03b1i interactions have unique properties that impart a high degree of specificity. The validated homology models of these GBA-G\u03b1i interactions (<a href=\"#bib34\">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2011b</a>) offer some clues into the origin of such specificity: despite docking onto the SwII/\u03b13 hydrophobic cleft of G\u03b1i, all GBA-motif containing proteins make additional and unique contacts with G\u03b1i, which generate specificity for each GBA motif. We conclude that the Daple:G\u03b1i interface has unique features that distinguish it from GIV:G\u03b1i or Calnuc:G\u03b1i interfaces, and exploiting such structural specificity may help devise strategies to selectively target the Daple:G\u03b1i interface, and thereby, modulate Wnt signaling."

At the immediate post-receptor level, Daple competes with Dvl, the major signaling scaffold for Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gao and Chen, 2010</a>), for binding to FZDR, and recruits and activates G\u03b1i in close proximity to activated receptors at the PM. That Dvl and Daple/G\u03b1i complexes may compete for binding to FZDR is in keeping with others' findings that overexpression of Dvl interferes with the engagement of Gi proteins with ligand-activated FZDRs (<a href=\"#bib54\">Kilander et al., 2014</a>), and that Dvl is unlikely to directly link G proteins to FZDRs, as proposed by some (<a href=\"#bib107\">Schulte and Bryja, 2007</a>). Once recruited, Daple's GEF activity triggers Gi activation, which leads to inhibition of cellular cAMP via G\u03b1i:GTP and activation of non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways involved in cell motility (e.g., PI3K and Rac1) via \u2018free\u2019 G\u03b2\u03b3. The consequences of these signaling mechanism are enhanced formation of actin stress fibers, 2D-cell migration after wounding, 3D-invasion through basement membrane proteins, and upregulation of genes that trigger EMT; all phenotypes that have been previously attributed to enhancement of non-canonical Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib87\">Minami et al., 2010</a>). We also show that the FZD7R-Daple-Gi axis suppresses responses associated with tumorigenesis, for example, \u03b2-catenin/TCF/LEF signaling, oncogenic transformation, anchorage independent growth, and anchorage-dependent colony formation; all attributable to its ability to activate G proteins via its GBA motif. Because the FZDR-Daple-Gi axis specifically modulates non-canonical Wnt signals, but has no effect on canonical Wnt responses, we conclude that Daple suppresses the canonical \u03b2-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway primarily by enhancing the antagonistic non-canonical Wnt pathway (<a href=\"#bib125\">Torres et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">MacLeod et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib143\">Ying et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib144\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chien et al., 2009</a>). Although the mechanism(s) by which the non-canonical Wnt pathway inhibits the canonical \u03b2-catenin/TCF/LEF pathway remains unclear, and some have proposed that such decisions are made at the level of the receptors (<a href=\"#bib75\">Logan and Nusse, 2004</a>), how Daple-dependent G protein signaling in the vicinity of the receptors may affect this process remains unclear. Our finding that Daple binds preferentially to some FZDRs, and not others, could influence the decision of canonical vs non-canonical Wnt signaling, or alternatively, activation of G\u03b1i and inhibition of cellular cAMP by Daple could directly antagonize a previously described role of the adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA pathway in phosphorylating and stabilizing \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#bib44\">Hino et al., 2005</a>). Regardless of the mechanism(s) involved, activation of Gi and enhancement of non-canonical Wnt signaling are accompanied by the suppression of the canonical \u03b2-catenin pathway in cells expressing Daple-WT, which correlates with all the key anti-growth and anti-transformation phenotypes that define a tumor suppressor/anti-oncogene (<a href=\"#bib21\">Cooper, 2000</a>). Although it is possible that some of the effects of the FZDR-Daple-Gi axis in tumor suppression are mediated by the destabilization of \u03b2-catenin, further investigations are required to clarify this point. We conclude that the G protein regulatory function of Daple is essential for enhancing at least two major cellular phenotypes previously attributed to non-canonical Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib83\">McDonald and Silver, 2009</a>), suppression of cell transformation and growth, and enhancement of cell invasion. As for potential implications in other key cellular processes that are deregulated during cancer progression, it is noteworthy that non-canonical Wnt signaling has also been demonstrated to play a crucial role in planar cell polarity and asymmetric cell division in stem cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bentzinger et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">2013</a>). Several studies have shown that the Wnt7A/FZD7 pathway establishes front-rear cell polarity and directional migration of human myogenic progenitors and facilitate the extension of satellite stem cells, all by activating PI3K/Akt pathway and Rac1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bentzinger et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">2013</a>). Because one of the major roles of the FZDR-Daple-Gi axis is enhancement of PI3K and Rac1 activities, it is possible that this axis also aids in the establishment of cell polarity and/or the maintenance of stem-ness via enhancement of the non-canonical Wnt pathway. Further studies are required to determine if such is the case."

We describe that expression of Daple in CTCs correlated with an increased EMT signature, disease progression (growth of current metastasis or formation of new metastasis), and poorer survival. This bimodal dysregulation (suppressed first, expressed later) and bi-faceted role (tumor suppressor in the normal epithelium, but enhancer of tumor invasion in cancer cells) during cancer progression mirrors what was previously unequivocally documented for the non-canonical Wnt5a signaling (<a href=\"#bib83\">McDonald and Silver, 2009</a>)\u2014Wnt5a signaling is suppressed earlier to allow cellular transformation and tumor growth, and enhanced later during tumor invasion. However, molecular mechanisms for such bimodal deregulation of the bi-faceted non-canonical Wnt pathway remain poorly understood. Such phenomenon is not restricted to Daple or the Wnt pathway, because major signaling programs like the TGF\u03b2-SMAD pathway have also been shown to display similar bimodal deregulation and a bi-faceted role (<a href=\"#bib3\">Akhurst and Derynck, 2001</a>), and a similar phenomenon is observed in the case of Daple's closely related orthologue, GIV (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ghosh et al., 2010</a>): downregulation of GIV by alternative splicing triggered proliferation early during tumor growth, whereas an increase in GIV by transcriptional upregulation enhanced cell invasion later during oncogenesis. Because Daple serves as a <i>bona fide</i> enhancer of the non-canonical Wnt pathway, we conclude that upregulation or downregulation in Daple expression contributes, at least in part, to the bimodal deregulation of the Wnt5a signaling pathway observed in cancers."

                                "text": "We also demonstrate that the mechanism for downregulation of Daple in cancers follows typical tumor suppressor genetics during neoplastic transformation (<a href=\"#bib100\">Payne and Kemp, 2005</a>). Downregulation of Daple mRNA coincided with adenoma-to-carcinoma transition, and the frequency of such downregulation in the primary tumor directly correlated with the degree of CIN. A loss of copy number of Daple DNA, and consequent downregulation of gene expression and function was noted in the primary tumors, predominantly among the tumors with CIN. This pattern is in keeping with the well-documented role of CIN in generating loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and haploinsufficiency of other tumor suppressors (<a href=\"#bib119\">Sotillo et al., 2009</a>). In the case of Daple, such insufficiency is likely to increase the fitness of cells that have undergone such a LOH because depletion of Daple suppresses non-canonical Wnt signaling and allows unrestricted propagation of canonical Wnt pathways. Consequently, proliferation/growth is triggered, which enables these cells to rapidly outcompete the remaining population. Based on the location of ccdc88c (Daple gene) at a site on the long arm of Chr 14, which is known to be frequently deleted in a variety of cancers (<a href=\"#bib120\">Suzuki et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Hu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Rouault et al., 2012</a>), we conclude that tumors harboring a focal deletion at that site are in part driven by insufficient expression of the tumor suppressor Daple. Additional mechanisms, for example, alternative splicing may further contribute to oncogenesis via dysregulation of Daple expression, as described in a rare and fatal human developmental anomaly (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ekici et al., 2010</a>). This anomaly was attributed to deregulation of Wnt signaling due to a loss of Daple's 29th exon, which contains the G protein regulatory GBA motif. Although many other mechanisms may be involved, loss of Daple expression, or a selective loss of its G protein regulatory function has emerged as a final common pathway, which disrupts Daple-G\u03b1i axis of Wnt signaling and derails tissue homeostasis."

                                "text": "The precise molecular mechanism(s) that enhances Daple expression or function and consequently triggers an EMT signature and cell invasion during cancer progression remains unclear. Transcriptional compensation for loss of an allele (<a href=\"#bib41\">Guidi et al., 2004</a>) or gain-of-function mutations (<a href=\"#bib130\">van Oijen and Slootweg, 2000</a>) is possible mechanisms, as shown previously in the case of other tumors suppressors. In this regard, it is noteworthy that although Daple bound the cytoplasmic tails of several FZDRs to varying extent, the preference for FZD7R was striking and may provide some clues as to why/how Daple may enhance tumor progression. Although all FZDRs promiscuously interact with more than one of the many Wnt isoforms to activate canonical and/or non-canonical Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib55\">King et al., 2012</a>), FZD7 stands out as a receptor that functions at the cross-roads of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways in a unique way. FZD7R is a downstream target of \u03b2-catenin in cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Barker and Clevers, 2006</a>), and consequently, enhanced canonical Wnt signaling upregulates FZD7R expression during cancer progression. It has been proposed that such increased FZD7R expression due to aberrant canonical Wnt signals may serve as a positive forward-feedback mechanism to perpetuate Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, thus, facilitating colorectal cancer progression and metastasis. Because Daple appears to be upregulated during cancer invasion and in circulating cancer cells (and such upregulation is associated with worse prognosis) and enhances non-canonical Wnt signaling downstream of FZD7R, it is possible that Daple's functional interaction with this receptor further enhances prometastatic signaling via amplification of the non-canonical Wnt pathway, which synergizes with the previously proposed forward-feedback canonical Wnt signaling loop during cancer progression. We conclude that such preferential signaling downstream of FZD7R and the temporal profile of expression of Daple are well-poised to suppress or enhance non-canonical Wnt signaling and aid in different steps of tumor progression (see legend for <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8L</a>)."

These findings set a new paradigm for the long-debated mechanisms by which FZDRs are coupled to G protein activation. As a potent tumor suppressor with multiple intriguing domains, for example, the newly identified GBA and the Frizzled-binding domain, Daple presents many signaling interfaces that could be developed as targets for modulating Wnt signaling. Because its levels of expression in primary tumors, circulating cell-free transcripts and in CTCs may indicate tumor characteristics, Daple presents many avenues for further development as clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers."

It is because of this reason, NIH3T3 cells are widely used to study proteins that can trigger a gain in invasive properties (<a href=\"#bib68\">Leitner et al., 2011</a>). For the neoplastic transformation assays, we used Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells because this is the gold standard assay used to study the role of a gene/protein in tumor transformation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Egan et al., 1987</a>). The rationale for using NIH3T3 in both the above assays is further strengthened by the fact that they are highly transfectable (\u223c80% transfection efficiency with myc-Daple) and express Daple at very low-endogenous levels (as determined by IB and qPCR) compared to normal colonic epithelium.

Briefly, Superscript III based cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies) was carried out to preamplify a region within the coiled-coil domain of Daple to maximize posterior detection rates (TaqMan Preamp kit, Applied Biosystems). Preamplified samples were subsequently subjected to TaqMan real-time PCR amplification (Applied Biosystems) (probe numbers Hs00380245_m1 and Hs00325884_m1). Non-specific blood cells in the CTC-enriched isolates were accounted for by analyzing the expression of CD45 as a lymphoid cell marker (not present in cancer cells). All the results for Daple are normalized with the expression of CD45 (in all sample types). Briefly, the Ct value (coming from qPCRs) for Daple and CD45 are subtracted to 40 (maximum number of cycles in qPCR) to get an intuitive value (more value, more expression). Daple 40-ct values are normalized with those from CD45, afterwards."
