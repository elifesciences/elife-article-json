However, the mechanism by which illumination is coupled to rhabdomere turnover remains unclear. We find that photoreceptors contain a light-dependent phospholipase D (PLD) activity. During illumination, loss of PLD resulted in an enhanced reduction in rhabdomere size, accumulation of Rab7 positive, rhodopsin1-containing vesicles (RLVs) in the cell body and reduced rhodopsin protein. These phenotypes were associated with reduced levels of phosphatidic acid, the product of PLD activity and were rescued by reconstitution with catalytically active PLD. In wild-type photoreceptors, during illumination, enhanced PLD activity was sufficient to clear RLVs from the cell body by a process dependent on Arf1-GTP levels and retromer complex function. Thus, during illumination, PLD activity couples endocytosis of RLVs with their recycling to the plasma membrane thus maintaining plasma membrane size and composition."

However, the mechanism by which illumination is coupled to rhabdomere turnover remains unclear. We find that photoreceptors contain a light-dependent phospholipase D (PLD) activity. During illumination, loss of PLD resulted in an enhanced reduction in rhabdomere size, accumulation of Rab7 positive, rhodopsin1-containing vesicles (RLVs) in the cell body and reduced rhodopsin protein. These phenotypes were associated with reduced levels of phosphatidic acid, the product of PLD activity and were rescued by reconstitution with catalytically active PLD. In wild-type photoreceptors, during illumination, enhanced PLD activity was sufficient to clear RLVs from the cell body by a process dependent on Arf1-GTP levels and retromer complex function. Thus, during illumination, PLD activity couples endocytosis of RLVs with their recycling to the plasma membrane thus maintaining plasma membrane size and composition."

Rhodopsin is found in distinct patches on the membrane surrounding each of these \u201cphotoreceptor\u201d cells and the number of rhodopsin molecules present controls how sensitive the cell is to light. In humans, vitamin A deficiency or genetic defects can decrease the number of rhodopsin molecules on the membrane, leading to difficulty in seeing in dim light."

Exposure to normal levels of light triggers parts of the membranes of fly photoreceptor cells to detach and move into the interior of the cell. These internalized pieces of membrane have two possible fates: they can either be destroyed or recycled back to the cell surface. This membrane turnover adjusts the size of the membrane surrounding the cell and the number of rhodopsin molecules in it to regulate the cell\u2019s sensitivity to light. It is crucial that turnover is tightly regulated in order to maintain the integrity of the cell membrane. However, it is not clear how the process is regulated during light exposure."

The experiments show that an enzyme called phospholipase D is activated when photoreceptors are exposed to light. Active phospholipase D \u2013 which generates a molecule called phosphatidic acid \u2013 coordinates the internalization of pieces of membrane with the recycling of rhodopsin back to the cell surface. Thakur et al. generated fly mutants that lacked phospholipase D and in these animals the internalized rhodopsin was not transported back to the cell membrane. This caused the membrane to shrink in size and decreased the number of rhodopsin molecules in it. As a result, the photoreceptor cells became less sensitive to light."

This strategy is used regardless of the architecture of the photoreceptor. For example, in ciliary photoreceptors (e.g vertebrate rods), light passes along the outer segment that is stacked with membranous discs, whereas in insect photoreceptors, the plasma membrane is expanded to form actin-based microvilli; both these structures are packed with rhodopsin, and incident light is absorbed as it passes along them (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arendt, 2003</a>). The light-sensitive membranes of photoreceptors undergo stimulus-dependent turnover (<a href=\"#bib21\">LaVail, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">White and Lord, 1975</a>); such turnover will alter both membrane area and composition, thus regulating sensitivity to light [reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blest, 1988</a>)]. The importance of this process is underscored by the human disease Best\u2019s macular dystrophy, in which rod outer segment length and electroretinograms are altered during changes in ambient illumination, ultimately leading to macular degeneration (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abr\u00e0moff et al., 2013</a>). Despite the importance of this process, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate photosensitivemembrane turnover remains poorly understood."

Photons that are absorbed trigger G-protein-coupled phospholipase C (PLC) activity that culminates in the activation of the plasma membrane channels TRP and TRPL; the resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx triggers an electrical response to light (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hardie and Raghu, 2001</a>). Additionally, photon absorption by rhodopsin1 (Rh1) also triggers the rhodopsin cycle [reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib26\">Raghu et al., 2012</a>)]. Following photon absorption, Rh1 undergoes photoisomerization to meta-rhodopsin (M). M is phosphorylated at its C-terminus, binds \u03b2-arrestin and this complex is removed from the microvillar membrane via clathrin-dependent endocytosis to be either recycled back to the microvillar plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib32\">Wang et al., 2014</a>) or trafficked to the lysosomes for degradation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chinchore et al., 2009</a>)\u00a0[reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib34\">Xiong and Bellen, 2013</a>)]. Tight regulation of this process is critical for rhabdomere integrity during illumination as mutants defective in any of the several steps of the rhodopsin cycle undergo light-dependent collapse of the rhabdomere [reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib26\">Raghu et al., 2012</a>)]. However, the process that couples endocytosis of rhabdomere membrane to plasma membrane recycling remains poorly understood."

                        "text": "Phospholipase D (PLD) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (PC) to generate phosphatidic acid (PA). In yeast, loss of PLD (<i>spo14</i>) results in a sporulation defect, failure to synthesize PA (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rudge et al., 2001</a>) and accumulation of undocked membrane vesicles on the spindle pole body (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nakanishi et al., 2006</a>). The v-SNARE Spo20p binds PA in vitro (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nakanishi et al., 2004</a>) and is required to dock Spo20p to target membranes; in this setting, PA generated by PLD appears to regulate a vesicular transport process. The potential role of PA in controlling vesicular transport also arose from observations <i>in vitro</i> that Arf proteins, key regulators of vesicular transport, stimulate mammalian PLD activity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brown et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cockcroft et al., 1994</a>). Overexpression of PLD1 in a range of neuronal (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Vitale et al., 2001</a>) and non-neuronal cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Choi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cockcroft et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Huang et al., 2005</a>) suggests that PLD can regulate vesicular transport. A previous study showed that elevated PA levels during development of <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptors disrupts rhabdomere biogenesis with associated endomembrane defects (<a href=\"#bib25\">Raghu et al., 2009</a>) that were Arf1-dependent. However, the mechanism underlying the role of PLD in regulating membrane transport has remained unclear, and to date, no study in metazoans has demonstrated a role, if any, for endogenous PLD in regulating vesicular transport <i>in vivo</i>. In this study, we show that during illumination in <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptors, rhabdomere size is regulated through the turnover of apical plasma membrane via RLVs. We find that photoreceptors have a light-regulated PLD activity that is required to maintain PA levels during illumination and support apical membrane size. PLD works in coordination with retromer function and Arf1 activity to regulate apical membrane size during illumination. Thus, PLD is a key regulator of plasma membrane turnover during receptor activation and signaling in photoreceptors."

Under these conditions, control photoreceptors maintain normal structure; however, <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i> undergoes light-dependent retinal degeneration. The degeneration starts by day 5 post-eclosion and all six peripheral photoreceptors degenerate by day 14 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). This degeneration is strictly dependent on illumination as <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i> not exposed to light retains normal ultrastructure up to day 14 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Photoreceptor degeneration is underpinned by a collapse of the apical microvillar membrane as well as the accumulation of membranous whorls within the cell body (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Retinal degeneration was also seen in a trans-heterozygote combination of two independently isolated alleles <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i> and <i>dPLD<sup>3.3</sup></i> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure\u00a0supplement\u00a01A, B</a>).

The light-dependent degeneration was also seen when the <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i> allele was placed over a deficiency chromosome for the <i>dPLD</i> gene region; in <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup>/Df(2R)ED1612</i>, retinal degeneration was comparable and was no worse than in <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i> homozygotes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), suggesting that <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i> is a null allele.

It is reported that in <i>laza<sup>22</sup></i> photoreceptors, lacking Type II PA phosphatase activity, PA levels rise during exposure to light (<a href=\"#bib14\">Garcia-Murillas et al., 2006</a>). We generated double mutants <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup>;laza<sup>22\u00a0</sup></i>and studied retinal degeneration in these flies. We found that <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup>;laza<sup>22\u00a0</sup></i>photoreceptors did not undergo light dependent-degeneration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). To test if this was due to restoration of PA levels, we measured PA levels in all these genotypes. As previously reported, we found that PA levels were elevated in <i>laza<sup>22</sup></i>; importantly, the reduced levels of PA seen in <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i> was restored in <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup>;laza<sup>22</sup></i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). We also overexpressed <i>rdgA</i>, encoding the major diacylglycerol kinase\u00a0(DGK) activity in photoreceptors. Overexpression of <i>rdgA</i> has previously been shown to elevate PA levels without affecting retinal ultrastructure (<a href=\"#bib25\">Raghu et al., 2009</a>). When <i>rdgA</i> is overexpressed in <i>dPLD<sup>3.1\u00a0</sup></i>(<i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup>;Rh1&gt;rdgA</i>), retinal degeneration was completely rescued and the reduced PA levels seen in <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i> were reverted back to wild type levels (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

In order to uncover a potential <i>dPLD</i> generated pool of PA, we exploited <i>dGq<sup>1</sup></i> mutants in which the failure to activate PLC\u03b2 results in a suppression of PA production via DGK (<a href=\"#bib14\">Garcia-Murillas et al., 2006</a>).

To understand the mechanism underlying the increased RLV number in <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i>, we exploited the temperature-sensitive allele of dynamin, <i>shi<sup>ts1</sup></i>. At the permissive temperature of 18\u00b0C, where dynamin function is normal, we exposed flies to a 5-min pulse of bright white light to trigger Rh1 isomerization to M and trigger its endocytosis. Under these conditions, the number of RLVs generated in cells with and without PLD function was indistinguishable (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Following this, animals were rapidly shifted to 25\u00b0C, incubated for various time periods, retinae were fixed, processed and RLVs counted. Under these conditions, in <i>shi<sup>ts1</sup></i>, where there is no further ongoing endocytosis, RLV numbers fall rapidly, presumably reflecting the removal of previously endocytosed vesicles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). By contrast, in <i>shi<sup>ts1</sup>;dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i>, following the shift to 25\u00b0C post-illumination, there was no drop in RLV number with time implying a defect in mechanisms that remove RLVs from the cell body (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

In <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i> photoreceptors, the process of light-induced membrane turnover is exaggerated; these photoreceptors show larger reductions in rhabdomere volume and greater reductions in Rh1 levels than is seen in wild-type flies.

Thus ,dPLD represents an enzyme activity that couples the generation of RLVs by light-induced endocytosis to their removal from the cell body. It has previously been reported that the Rh1 that accumulates in Rab7 compartment is targeted for degradation, thus leading to retinal degeneration (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chinchore et al., 2009</a>). Accumulation of Rh1 in Rab7-positive endosomes may explain the progressive microvillar collapse and reduced Rh1 protein levels in the cell body of <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i>. Both, the microvillar degeneration and reduced PA levels of <i>dPLD<sup>3.1\u00a0</sup></i>retinae were rescued by a <i>dPLD</i> transgene with intact lipase activity and elevation of PA levels was sufficient to rescue this phenotype.

Sorting reactions in vesicular transport often involve a small GTPase working in conjunction with a lipid-metabolizing enzyme. Altering <i>garz</i> function, presumably altering Arf1-GTP levels, has three consequences: (i) in wild-type cells, enhancing <i>garz</i> levels results in fewer RLVs and blocks the rise in RLVs seen during light exposure. (ii) enhancing <i>garz</i> levels reduces RLV accumulation in <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i> (iii) enhancing <i>garz</i> levels suppresses degeneration in <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i> while depleting <i>garz</i> in wild-type flies results in light-dependent retinal degeneration with a time course similar to that seen in <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i>. Thus, an Arf1-GTP dependent step is required for both RLV turnover and maintaining apical domain size in photoreceptors. Our finding that the ability of <i>Rh1&gt;dPLD</i> to modulate RLV number requires intact <i>garz</i> function (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) is consistent with this model. These findings imply that Arf1-GTP levels positively regulate a step that enhances RLV recycling to the microvillar plasma membrane in the face of ongoing light-induced endocytosis, presumably through retromer complex activity. In support of this idea, we found that the ability of <i>Rh1&gt;garz</i> to reduce RLV numbers during illumination depends on intact retromer function (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). We propose, that during illumination, rhabdomere size is maintained by the balance between clathrin-dependent endocytosis generating RLVs and an Arf1-GTP dependent sorting event that recycles RLVs to the plasma membrane via retromer activity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). <i>dPLD</i>, specifically its product PA is likely able to balance these two reactions by coupling light-induced endocytosis to Arf1-dependent sorting of RLVs into the recycling pathway. Previous studies have identified proteins from brain cytosol that bind PA <i>in vitro</i> and are known to regulate membrane transport events; prominent among these was Arf1 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Manifava et al., 2001</a>) although the <i>in vivo</i> significance of this binding is unknown. Our findings that the biological activity of Arf1<sup>CA</sup> in photoreceptors requires intact <i>dPLD</i> activity and that the ability of increased <i>garz</i> (Arf1-GEF) levels to clear RLVs requires intact <i>dPLD</i> function suggests that Arf1 is a key target of PA generated by dPLD in mediating sorting and recycling of RLVs in photoreceptors. It has been reported that EHD1 an ATPase required to generate tubular recycling endosomes is recruited by MICAL-L1 and the BAR domain protein syndapin2 both of which bind PA (<a href=\"#bib15\">Giridharan et al., 2013</a>). It is possible that these proteins are also targets of PA generated by dPLD. In the absence of PA, RLV sorting into the recycling pathway is impaired in <i>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></i>, some fraction of the endocytosed RLVs accumulates in Rab7 endosomes and is targeted for degradation leading to the reduction in Rh1 levels. These reduced Rh1 levels likely account for the reduced light sensitivity of dPLD mutants reported both in this study as well as in a previous analysis (<a href=\"#bib20\">LaLonde et al., 2005</a>)."

At this location, dPLD might bind to the C-terminal tail of M either before or after it is endocytosed into RLV; binding of mammalian PLD1 has been reported to the C-terminal tail of several rhodopsin superfamily GPCRs including the 5-HT2<sub>a</sub>, muscarinic and opioid receptors [(<a href=\"#bib3\">Barclay et al., 2011</a>) and references therein]. It is possible that PA produced by dPLD bound to the C-terminus of Rh1 may then stimulate recycling to the apical membrane. Thus, the control of apical membrane turn over by dPLD during illumination may represent an example by which ligand bound GPCRs signal without a direct involvement for heterotrimeric G-protein activity. More generally\u00a0in the brain,neurons and glial cells express GPCRs (5-HT2a, mGluR and opioid receptors) of key functional importance. Controlling these GPCR numbers on the plasma membrane during receptor stimulation (of which rhodopsin turnover during illumination is a prototypical example) is of critical importance to brain function and mechanisms that regulate this process will likely be crucial for the understanding and treatment of neuropsychiatric syndromes."

Here phosphatidic acid generated by light-activated PLD (via a pathway independent of trimeric G protein activation) is proposed to activate Arf1 and this in turn regulates recycling of the rhodopsin back to the rhabdomere membrane. The significance of this work is that it provides the first confident description of a PLD phenotype in a multicellular eukaryote and in a quantifiable and powerful system of intense lipid signaling. The work is generally thorough, well-controlled and brings new perspective to a field of lipid signaling that badly needs it."

The Spo20 control experiment shows that the liposome binding of this protein is specific to PA (as is expected) and that it is concentration-dependent. However, you should examine dARF binding over the same range of concentration of PtdOH rather than showing one concentration in one Figure panel (8D) and another in the supplemental data. In addition, you should include a PtdSer control as well. Although one reviewer felt that the PtdOH binding data being omitted, the consensus was that you should perform the additional experiment as suggested above. This should be straightforward and it would lend biochemical support to your strong genetic/biological data."

The binding of at 70:30 is optimal for Spo2 and at 90:10 the binding is weak. The data in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a> shows binding at 90:10. What was the binding at different concentrations? I will leave it to the lipid biochemists to give it their expert evaluation but I am skeptical of the data. It looks too different from the positive control to be compelling. I would prefer the authors leave the issue of the protein binding to PA unresolved than presenting data of this quality."

While it would have been ideal to pin-point a clear target for PLD-generated PtdOH in regulating Arf or the retromer complex, the likelihood of multiple targets does make this potentially an unattainable result in the time frame allotted. The fact that Arf does bind PtdOH provides biochemistry that is at least consistent with the pathway laid out by the genetics. In summary, this is an important paper and I am satisfied with the revisions made."

However, it is also a challenging one given that there are dozens of proteins that have been shown to bind PA in vitro. In the context of the present study, Arf1, garz and retromer components are plausible protein targets to which PA might bind and exert its effects. Given the large number of proteins in the retromer complex it was difficult to decide on which ones to study. However we performed in vitro liposome based binding assays to test PA binding to endogenous <i>Drosophila</i> Arf1 and GARZ. We could not demonstrate binding of garz to PA containing liposomes (Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C). However, we were able to demonstrate weak binding of endogenous <i>Drosophila</i> Arf1 to PA containing liposomes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). The ability of Arf1 to bind to PA containing liposomes was weak in comparison to that of the well-known PA binding protein Spo20. Up to 30% PA was required to show good binding of Arf1 to PA containing liposomes. Together with our finding that the biological effects of expressing Arf1CA on photoreceptors required intact dPLD function (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), the in vitro binding assay suggests that Arf1 is a likely protein target of PA produced by PLD."
