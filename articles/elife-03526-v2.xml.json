Diversification of a single chemotaxis system could serve as an alternative, or even evolutionary stepping-stone, to switching between multiple systems. We hypothesized that mutations in gene regulation could lead to heritable control of chemotactic diversity. By simulating foraging and colonization of <i>E. coli</i> using a single-cell chemotaxis model, we found that different environments selected for different behaviors. The resulting trade-offs show that populations facing diverse environments would ideally diversify behaviors when time for navigation is limited. We show that advantageous diversity can arise from changes in the distribution of protein levels among individuals, which could occur through mutations in gene regulation. We propose experiments to test our prediction that chemotactic diversity in a clonal population could be a selectable trait that enables adaptation to environmental variability."

Diversification of a single chemotaxis system could serve as an alternative, or even evolutionary stepping-stone, to switching between multiple systems. We hypothesized that mutations in gene regulation could lead to heritable control of chemotactic diversity. By simulating foraging and colonization of <i>E. coli</i> using a single-cell chemotaxis model, we found that different environments selected for different behaviors. The resulting trade-offs show that populations facing diverse environments would ideally diversify behaviors when time for navigation is limited. We show that advantageous diversity can arise from changes in the distribution of protein levels among individuals, which could occur through mutations in gene regulation. We propose experiments to test our prediction that chemotactic diversity in a clonal population could be a selectable trait that enables adaptation to environmental variability."

The core of the network is a two-component signal transduction system that carries chemical information gathered by transmembrane receptors to flagellar motors responsible for cell propulsion. A second group of proteins allows the cells to physiologically adapt to changing background signal levels, enabling them to track signal gradients over many orders of magnitude. While different receptors allow cells to sense different signals, all signals are then processed through the same set of cytoplasmic proteins responsible for signal transduction and adaptation. This horizontal integration may impose conflicting demands on the regulation of these core decision-making components because signals can vary in time, space, and identity. In this study, we examine to what extent cell-to-cell variability in abundance of these core proteins may help resolve such conflicts."

Clockwise rotation tends to disrupt the bundle, interrupting runs with brief direction-changing tumbles. The fraction of time a motor spins clockwise, or clockwise bias, controls the frequency of tumbles and thus plays a central role in chemotactic behavior. Tumble frequency increases monotonically with clockwise bias until the latter reaches about 0.9, at which point cells tumble nearly twice a second and are essentially stationary (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alon et al., 1998</a>).

Various mechanisms can contribute to such variability, including noise in gene expression (<a href=\"#bib16\">Elowitz et al., 2002</a>). Random segregation of proteins during cell division probably plays a role as well (<a href=\"#bib22\">Huh and Paulsson, 2011</a>) and may impose a lower bound on minimum variability attainable (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lestas et al., 2010</a>). Chemotaxis genes are chromosomally organized in operons\u2014that is, expression of multiple genes are driven by common promoters. This genetic architecture ensures that noise in the activity of shared promoters will affect the expression of multiple genes in a correlated manner, conserving the ratios of proteins from cell to cell despite variations in total amounts (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lovdok et al., 2009</a>). Correlation in protein noise has been experimentally shown to be important in determining chemotactic performance (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lovdok et al., 2007</a>).

Due to the lack of quantitative information about the details of the natural environments of <i>E. coli</i> that would be relevant to chemotaxis, our goal is not the exact reconstruction of the distribution of challenges experienced by <i>E. coli</i> in the wild, but rather to use bacterial chemotaxis as a system to study the interactions between population diversity and environmental trade-offs. Although different signals are sensed by different receptors, the cell interprets all signals using the same set of proteins. Since we are interested in the relationship between cellular dynamics and the length- and time-scales of the environment, this allows us to simplify our study by focusing on different gradients of a single attractant type. Our findings should apply to different signal identities as well."

In this model, the abundance of each protein is lognormal-distributed and depends on a few parameters that determine the mean abundance and the extrinsic (correlated) and intrinsic (uncorrelated) noise in protein abundance (details of the model discussed further below) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Elowitz et al., 2002</a>).

In this paper we only consider clockwise bias values below \u223c0.9, because above this value cells can spend many seconds in the clockwise state (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alon et al., 1998</a>). During such long intervals, non-canonical swimming in the clockwise state can occur. In this case, the chemotactic response is inverted and cells tend to drift away from attractants (<a href=\"#bib27\">Khan et al., 1978</a>). This behavior is therefore maladaptive for the cell; however, it is only observed in mutant cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alon et al., 1998</a>).

An important ecological parameter in this situation is the characteristic distance between resources, which sets the typical signal length-scale a bacterium must navigate. When a source is close, the challenge might be to climb steep gradients and to stay near the source. In contrast, when the environment is sparse, the ability to explore and navigate shallow gradients may be more important. Another important ecological parameter is the characteristic time-scale of changes in the environment, which dictates the allotted time a bacterium has to navigate its environment. As this time becomes shorter (e.g. when bacteria must take advantage of nutrient patches in moving flows [<a href=\"#bib68\">Taylor and Stocker, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Celani and Vergassola, 2010</a>]) chemotactic performance becomes more important. For these reasons, we parameterized environments in terms of distances and times. The range of values was chosen such that at one extreme, cells begin at the source, and at the other, the distance and time requirements are so stringent that reaching the source is only possible by swimming randomly (i.e. pure diffusion)."

This occurs, for instance, upon lysis of a unicellular eukaryote (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blackburn et al., 1998</a>). The location of the parcel is unpredictable and could be close or far. Each cell in the simulation accumulated nutrient by collecting an amount proportional to the concentration at its position at every time-step. Performance was defined as the amount of nutrient acquired (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) within a certain time limit. For simplicity we assumed that consumption by an individual is small enough not to have an impact on the gradient itself. Feedback of populations onto the shape of the gradient certainly plays a role in many ecological scenarios and could be considered in this framework in the future."

We approximated the site as a persistent spherical zone with a non-depleting concentration of attractant. Performance was defined by minimizing the time to reach the site, equivalent to maximizing the reciprocal of the arrival time, before a global time limit, which may be determined ecologically by the carrying capacity of the site or the periodic purging of the area around the site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

For each phenotype and environment, 6000\u201330,000 replicate trajectories were averaged together to quantify performance as a function of phenotype and environment.

Successful cells had high clockwise bias, which curtails long runs, and short adaptation time, which mitigates large responses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These cells in a way are defeating chemotaxis and motility both: to stay rooted, they tumble constantly and have a fast adaptation time that reduces the duration of response. If chemotactic populations are preparing for unexpected types of environments but have uniformly turned on expression of chemotaxis and motility genes, cells with these phenotypes could potentially function as if those processes were turned off, without having to introduce a genetic on-off switch. Conversely, when a source appeared farther away, cells had to use longer runs to reach the expanding front of the gradient and long adaptation times to integrate the weaker signals at its tails (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). If time is further limited, this far-source effect is exaggerated (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

The dynamic range of CheY-P has a negligible effect on cell performance so long as it is sufficiently high as to ensure that the response of CheY-P to kinase activity is linear and does not saturate (<a href=\"#fig2s8\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 8</a>).

This becomes even more apparent if we plot the optimal phenotype as a function of source distance (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). These results are consistent with our recent study (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dufour et al., 2014</a>) that used an analytical model to predict the velocity of cells climbing static one-dimensional gradients and detailed the mechanistic basis of performance differences between phenotypes. There, we demonstrated a trade-off wherein steep gradients required fast adaptation time and high clockwise bias for optimal velocity, whereas shallow gradients required slow adaptation time and low clockwise bias. Our present simulations of ecological tasks show that this trade-off also exists in more complex chemotactic scenarios. The dependence of the optimal phenotype on the environment follows the same trend in the previous analytical model as it does in our current simulation results, wherein simulations of distant sources are similar to simple shallow gradients and nearer sources are analogous to steeper gradients."

Such features include the organization of the genes on the chromosome and the sequences of ribosomal binding sites (RBSs) and promoter regions. Selection for individuals with mutations in these features would give rise to adaptation of the distribution without changing highly-conserved network proteins. In our model of gene expression, such alterations were realized through changes in the levels of extrinsic and intrinsic noise and the mean expression level of each protein.

These outcomes could be measured by performing single cell phenotype analyses and by re-sequencing the operon.

This dependency is especially strong when time for navigation is limited.

Additionally, interactions with more than two environments are likely to occur and could be analyzed in the same way. Such cases will likely impose more constraints on navigation, giving rise to stronger trade-off problems. Increasing the number of phenotypic parameters would not necessarily alleviate these constraints, which would instead be primarily governed by the distance between the optimal phenotypes for these tasks in phenotypic parameter space."

Phages and recombination events can reorganize genes, changing intrinsic noise relative to extrinsic noise by altering expression correlation. Regulators of promoters can incur mutations that result in negative feedback repression to reduce promoter noise.

Different media and growth phases alter the expression levels of these proteins (<a href=\"#bib35\">Li and Hazelbauer, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Scott et al., 2010</a>) and will naturally change the distribution of phenotypes as well\u2014this could be a mechanism for separating protein levels required for chemotaxis from those better suited for growth. In this study, challenges and regrowth occurred in discrete sequential steps and there was no direct inheritance of phenotype. The relative importance of these features will depend on the relationship between their time-scales and those of the environmental challenges (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kussell and Leibler, 2005</a>). If the time-scale of environmental change is much slower than the time-scale of adaptation, for example, populations will adapt to their current environment rather than the statistics of environmental fluctuations."

Phenotypic diversification within a single system may bridge the gap between one system and many by allowing populations to adapt to greater environmental variation without developing a new biological module. Multicellular organisms also exhibit different motion strategies in their constituent cells, from the singular approach of human sperm to the different motility patterns of neutrophils as they navigate the body to sites of infection and capture invading organisms (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eisenbach and Lengeler, 2004</a>). Our framework could be used to investigate several open questions in such systems: How does behavioral diversity of single cells affect the fitness of the organism, and when is the diversification of a single cell type supplanted by the commitment of a new developmental cell lineage?"

Thus, while horizontal integration is beautifully economical and a ubiquitous feature of biological pathways, our study illustrates that it is also likely to introduce trade-offs by design."

Consideration of cells with CW bias above 0.9 is not relevant for our study because neither in measurements of wildtype cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Park et al., 2010</a>) (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for our fit to that data) nor in our optimized populations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) do we see more than 1% of cells with clockwise bias above 0.5. In experiments, cells with clockwise bias above 0.9 are only observed in mutants (e.g. CheB mutant) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alon et al., 1998</a>). In wildtype, negative feedback of the kinase CheA on CheB-P implies that even when CheY or CheR are highly over expressed the level of CheY-P is maintained low enough to avoid that deleterious regime of inverted chemotaxis. As a result we can rule out this effect for the current study."

Here, this variation arises solely from variability in protein levels, as these were the sole quantities that were varied between cells within a population.

This conservation shows that our model recapitulates and resolves a fundamental unexplained dichotomy in the chemotaxis pathway: population variability around the average is possible in addition to high robustness of the population average. Hence the pathway is sensitive to molecular noise at the single cell level, but robust at the population level. Finally, simulations of the population model to reproduce the experiment by Shimizu et al.
