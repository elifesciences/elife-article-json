The ability to recapitulate age-related characteristics of human neurons in culture will offer unprecedented opportunities to study the biological processes underlying neuronal aging. Here, we show that using a recently demonstrated microRNA-based cellular reprogramming approach, human fibroblasts from postnatal to near centenarian donors can be efficiently converted into neurons that maintain multiple age-associated signatures. Application of an epigenetic biomarker of aging (referred to as epigenetic clock) to DNA methylation data revealed that the epigenetic ages of fibroblasts were highly correlated with corresponding age estimates of reprogrammed neurons. Transcriptome and microRNA profiles reveal genes differentially expressed between young and old neurons. Further analyses of oxidative stress, DNA damage and telomere length exhibit the retention of age-associated cellular properties in converted neurons from corresponding fibroblasts. Our results collectively demonstrate the maintenance of age after neuronal conversion."

The ability to recapitulate age-related characteristics of human neurons in culture will offer unprecedented opportunities to study the biological processes underlying neuronal aging. Here, we show that using a recently demonstrated microRNA-based cellular reprogramming approach, human fibroblasts from postnatal to near centenarian donors can be efficiently converted into neurons that maintain multiple age-associated signatures. Application of an epigenetic biomarker of aging (referred to as epigenetic clock) to DNA methylation data revealed that the epigenetic ages of fibroblasts were highly correlated with corresponding age estimates of reprogrammed neurons. Transcriptome and microRNA profiles reveal genes differentially expressed between young and old neurons. Further analyses of oxidative stress, DNA damage and telomere length exhibit the retention of age-associated cellular properties in converted neurons from corresponding fibroblasts. Our results collectively demonstrate the maintenance of age after neuronal conversion."

These late-onset disorders can be difficult to study because it is rarely possible to collect diseased cells from patients.

These new brain cells will have the same genetic makeup as the patients they came from, but whether these converted cells would reflect the patient\u2019s age too remained to be determined."

The age of the cells was tested by looking at age-linked markers attached to their DNA known as an \u201cepigenetic clock\u201d. In addition, Huh et al. measured the age of the cells by examining the expression of genes altered with aging. Other factors examined included the amount of damaged DNA and the size of DNA regions called telomeres, which become shorter with age. Together, all of these indicated that the converted brain cells retain the age of the fibroblasts that they were made from."

However, because of the\u00a0inaccessibility to neurons from elderly individuals, studying these age-related cellular processes in human neurons remains a difficult task. Cellular reprogramming approaches have explored generating populations of human neurons by inducing pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from human fibroblasts and subsequent differentiation into neurons\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib50\">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Takahashi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hanna et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hu et al., 2010</a>). Importantly, this induction of pluripotency in adult fibroblasts reverts cellular age to an embryonic stage\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Lapasset et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Patterson et al., 2012</a>) which remains even after differentiation into neurons\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib42\">Patterson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Miller et al., 2013</a>). While this is useful for modeling early developmental phenotypes\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib27\">Lafaille et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2009</a>), iPSC-derived cells have been reported to be unsuitable in recapitulating phenotypes selectively observed in aged cells\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib37\">Mattson and Magnus, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Vera and Studer, 2015</a>). Recently, experimental manipulations to accelerate aging in iPSC-derived cells have been explored, for instance, by overexpressing progerin, a mutant form of lamin A observed in progeria syndrome, to force the detection of age-related pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Arbab et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cornacchia and Studer, 2015</a>)."

Because this neuronal conversion is direct and bypasses pluripotent/multipotent stem cell stages, we reasoned that miR-mediated directly reprogrammed neurons would retain the age signature of the original donor. To assess the cellular age, we used the epigenetic clock method, which is a highly accurate biomarker of age based on DNA methylation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib23\">Horvath, 2013</a>). Further, we evaluated age-associated signatures based on gene expression levels, miRNAs, and cellular readouts considered to be hallmarks of aging\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">L\u00f3pez-Ot\u00edn et al., 2013</a>). Our thorough investigation into multiple age-associated signatures collectively demonstrate the maintenance of cellular age of the original donor during neuronal conversion and strongly suggest that directly converted human neurons can be advantageous for studying age-related neuronal disorders."

We therefore elected to test our recently developed conversion approach that utilizes miR-9/9*-124 and transcription factors to robustly generate a highly enriched population of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) from the fibroblasts of donors of varying ages\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib46\">Richner et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Victor et al., 2014</a>). Fibroblast samples from donors ranging from 3 days to 96 years of age were collected and expanded to match population doubling level (PDL) to eliminate any confounding variability introduced by sequential passaging\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pazolli and Stewart, 2008</a>), then subsequently transduced with miR-9/9*-124 with CTIP2, DLX1/2, and MYT1L (CDM) following our established protocol\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib46\">Richner et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Victor et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Reprogrammed cells were then stained for neuronal markers, MAP2, TUBB3, NeuN and MSN markers, DARPP32 and GABA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>). MAP2 and TUBB3-positive reprogrammed neurons exhibiting extensive neurite outgrowth represented approximately 70\u201380% of the cell population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), demonstrating the consistency of reprogramming efficiency in all fibroblast samples. Neurons reprogrammed from young and old fibroblasts exhibited fast inward currents and action potentials in monocultures without necessitating coculturing with glial cells or primary neurons (n\u00a0=\u00a011) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In addition, the consistent upregulation of neuronal genes, including MAP2, NCAM, and voltage-gated sodium channels, and downregulation of fibroblast-associated genes were observed in reprogrammed neurons from both young and old cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest the consistent applicability of miRNA-based neuronal reprogramming in fibroblasts of all ages."

The epigenetic clock, which analyzes the methylation status of 353 specific CpG loci, has been shown to be a highly accurate age estimator that applies to all human organs, tissues, and cell types\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib23\">Horvath, 2013</a>). The epigenetic clock leads to an age estimate (in units of years) which is referred to as epigenetic age or DNA methylation (DNAm) age. We analyzed DNA methylation levels of neurons converted from 16 fibroblast samples aged three days to 96 years alongside 37 fibroblast samples aged three days to 94 years (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The actual chronological donor age was highly correlated with the estimated DNAm age of fibroblasts (correlation = 0.75) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and of reprogrammed neurons (correlation = 0.82) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Importantly, when the DNAm age of each reprogrammed neuron was compared to the DNAm age of the corresponding fibroblast, there was a near-perfect correlation (correlation = 0.91), which suggests that the epigenetic clock is unperturbed during miRNA-based neuronal reprogramming (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and supports the notion of age maintenance during direct neuronal conversion.

Interestingly, we detected fourteen microRNAs commonly regulated with age in both fibroblasts and reprogrammed neurons, including miR-10a, miR-497, and miR-195, whose expression increased with age (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Because microRNAs have been implicated as global regulators of aging-associated cellular processes\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Harries, 2014</a>) through repression of existing target transcripts\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">He and Hannon, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pasquinelli, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>), we reasoned that these age-upregulated microRNAs may target and repress classes of genes found to be downregulated in old reprogrammed neurons. Indeed, GO analysis of predicted targets amongst age-downregulated transcripts in reprogrammed neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) for miR-10a-5p and miR-497-5p revealed terms associated with age such as metabolism and cellular death and survival (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Our results suggest the potential role of miR-10a and miR-497 in regulating genes involved in cell death and survival, metabolic pathways, and DNA repair. While the exact role of these microRNAs in aging is unknown, miR-10a and miR-497 have been previously implicated in aging-associated cellular processes including inflammation, senescence, metabolism and telomerase activity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Kondo et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Qin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fang et al., 2010</a>). Importantly, the increased expression of miR-10a, miR-497 and miR-195 detected in reprogrammed neurons was also validated by qPCR to be concordantly upregulated in human striatum and cortex samples from old individuals in comparison to young individuals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These results further support the validity of reprogrammed neurons for detecting age-associated changes in microRNA network, mirroring changes observed in human brain."

Oxidative stress has been reported to increase with age, in part due to the\u00a0accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib25\">Keating, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Prigione et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Suhr et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cui et al., 2012</a>). FACS analysis of ROS levels using fluorescent marker MitoSOX\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib39\">Miller et al., 2013</a>) revealed that old reprogrammed neurons have increased ROS levels compared to young reprogrammed neurons, mirroring the observed age-associated differences of ROS levels in fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Moreover, reprogrammed neurons were analyzed by Comet Assay, a single-cell gel electrophoresis technique that assesses DNA damage accumulation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib47\">Singh et al., 1990</a>). Old reprogrammed neurons were found to have longer comet tail lengths, an age-associated property also observed in fibroblasts, that reflects more extensive DNA damage accumulation compared to young cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Additionally, neuronal conversion maintained the length of telomeres from starting fibroblast which is virtually unchanged (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), in contrast to the progressive increase in length commonly observed with iPSC reprogramming, where telomeres reach a plateau of around 12\u201314 kilobases after a few cellular passages\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Agarwal et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Batista et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Marion et al., 2009</a>).

In addition to the demonstration of age-associated transcriptomic changes reported previously\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib38\">Mertens et al., 2015</a>), our results provide novel insights into multiple key signatures associated with age\u2014 epigenetic, microRNA and cellular\u2014 that are consistently maintained in directly converted neurons. Because aging is a complex process affecting many hallmarks of a cell\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">L\u00f3pez-Ot\u00edn et al., 2013</a>), our assessment of a broad spectrum of age-related markers suggests that directly converted neurons may serve as an alternative model of neuronal aging to iPSC-derived neurons, whose erasure of multiple aging-associated signatures precludes it from adequately modeling, especially, late-onset diseases. Whereas, future studies may investigate whether additional aging marks are similarly conserved in reprogrammed neurons to model different facets of aging. While miR-9/9*-124-based reprogramming can directly convert fibroblasts with similar efficiency to neurons, we note that the older fibroblasts have lower replicative potential in a\u00a0culture. However, this does not impede in the conversion efficiency of old fibroblasts. MiRNA-mediated generation of aged neurons paves the road to direct conversion into specific neuronal subtypes to investigate the contribution of neuronal aging to late-onset neurodegenerative disorders."

Cells were washed three times with PBS, dissociated with 0.25% Trypsin, then stained with DAPI. If FACs was not conducted on the\u00a0same day, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were compared to untreated (unstained) fibroblast and reprogrammed neurons. Cell sorting was performed on a FACSCalibur and LsrFortessa (BD Biosciences), while quantification of the percent of the population of MitoSOX positive cells was performed using FlowJo X 10.0.7r2. Each plot on the graph represents an individual experiment with multiple reprogrammed neurons. Unpaired t-test analysis of 3 sets of experiments of reprogrammed neurons from young fibroblasts compared to reprogrammed neurons from old fibroblasts. Young samples included reprogrammed neurons from fibroblasts aged three days, five month, one year and two years, while old samples were from donors aged 86, 90, 91, 92A, and 92B years. Analyzed fibroblast samples include 1, 2, 91, 72, 74, and 94-year-old samples. P-values were calculated with the\u00a0student <i>t</i>-test."

They convincingly show that the reprogramming works with cells of a range of ages, showing good staining of neuron-specific markers, and impressive changes in gene expression patterns from a fibroblast pattern to a neuronal pattern. They use a variety of assays to support the interpretation that the conversion maintains the \"age\" of the donor cells. In general, the data support their conclusions well. They use a DNA methylation assay as an assay of \"epigenetic age\" and show a reasonable correlation between fibroblast age and epigenetic age as measured in the converted neurons."

The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that miRNA-derived neurons retain the age profile of their donors. Interestingly, fibroblasts from donors sampling a wide age range (from a few days old to 94 years old), after being reprogrammed into neurons retained the DNA methylation levels, telomere size, transcription profile, levels of DNA damage, etc. This result is in contrast to neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which reset their clock in terms of telomere size, gene expression profile, oxidative stress, etc."

The authors were thorough in testing all the important age markers and convincingly demonstrate the key point of the paper. However, this work is purely a cell characterization study and therefore only incremental (the actual miRNA conversion itself has been published in several articles before). More importantly, it has already been shown that fibroblasts reprogrammed into neurons (via a different route) retain the age-specific transcriptomic profile, see Mertens et al., Directly Reprogrammed Human Neurons Retain Aging-Associated Transcriptomic Signatures and Reveal Age-Related Nucleocytoplasmic Defects, Cell Stem Cell, 2015. This published paper has only casually been referenced. Along the same lines, in the Introduction, the study was motivated by the following sentence: \"Because this neuronal conversion is direct and bypasses pluripotent / multipotent stem cell stages, we reasoned that directly reprogrammed neurons would retain the age signature of the original donor.\" This statement makes it seem as if this phenomenon has not already been shown before."

They convincingly show that the reprogramming works with cells of a range of ages, showing good staining of neuron-specific markers, and impressive changes in gene expression patterns from a fibroblast pattern to a neuronal pattern. They use a variety of assays to support the interpretation that the conversion maintains the \"age\" of the donor cells. In general, the data support their conclusions well. They use a DNA methylation assay as an assay of \"epigenetic age\" and show a reasonable correlation between fibroblast age and epigenetic age as measured in the converted neurons.</i> "

After the cells are embedded in low melting-point agar, we incubate the coverslip in lysis buffer overnight, then we run it through gel electrophoresis to allow a voltage to run through. Each comet represents the DNA content of one cell and the more DNA damage that exists the further the DNA will travel, creating longer comets. Since we aren\u2019t loading DNA specifically and rather whole individual cells, it is unlikely that the differences in comet tail length are attributable to technique such as loading error. We additionally stained the cells with SYBR green and visualized the cells with the same exposure, gain, and fluorescent intensity.

This published paper has only casually been referenced. Along the same lines, in the Introduction, the study was motivated by the following sentence: \"Because this neuronal conversion is direct and bypasses pluripotent / multipotent stem cell stages, we reasoned that directly reprogrammed neurons would retain the age signature of the original donor.\" This statement makes it seem as if this phenomenon has not already been shown before.</i> "

We ensured that we provided proper references throughout the manuscript when we discuss transcriptome changes. However, transcriptome analysis is only a fraction of what we assessed in our study, and we respectively argue that our findings about epigenetic clock measurements and microRNA profiles (as well as cellular properties) are novel and important findings. Aging is a complex biological process and with the implication of utilizing directly converted human neurons to model late-onset diseases, it is important to characterize many hallmarks of aging to achieve a more comprehensive sense of the age status of the reprogrammed neurons, which has been accomplished in our study. The future goals in our lab are to investigate the contribution and role of age-regulated microRNAs in aging."
