Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are strongly induced in the liver by systemic infection and in the intestine by bacterial colonization, but their exact functions remain unclear. Here we show that mouse and human SAAs are retinol binding proteins. Mouse and human SAAs bound retinol with nanomolar affinity, were associated with retinol in vivo, and limited the bacterial burden in tissues after acute infection. We determined the crystal structure of mouse SAA3 at a resolution of 2 \u00c5, finding that it forms a tetramer with a hydrophobic binding pocket that can accommodate retinol. Our results thus identify SAAs as a family of microbe-inducible retinol binding proteins, reveal a unique protein architecture involved in retinol binding, and suggest how retinol is circulated during infection."

Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are strongly induced in the liver by systemic infection and in the intestine by bacterial colonization, but their exact functions remain unclear. Here we show that mouse and human SAAs are retinol binding proteins. Mouse and human SAAs bound retinol with nanomolar affinity, were associated with retinol in vivo, and limited the bacterial burden in tissues after acute infection. We determined the crystal structure of mouse SAA3 at a resolution of 2 \u00c5, finding that it forms a tetramer with a hydrophobic binding pocket that can accommodate retinol. Our results thus identify SAAs as a family of microbe-inducible retinol binding proteins, reveal a unique protein architecture involved in retinol binding, and suggest how retinol is circulated during infection."

However, treating the cells with retinol or the molecule it is broken down into\u2014called retinoic acid\u2014caused more SAAs to be made. Derebe, Zlatkov et al. also discovered that SAAs are associated with retinol in blood samples taken from mice infected with salmonella; and that both mouse and human SAAs bind tightly to retinol. Combined, this evidence suggests that SAAs are the retinol binding proteins that transport retinol during infections."

Retinol is derived from dietary vitamin A and can be converted enzymatically to retinoic acid, which complexes with nuclear receptors to regulate gene transcription programs in cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Germain et al., 2006</a>). In this way, retinol promotes the maturation of innate immune cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lawson and Berliner, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Stephensen, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Spencer et al., 2014</a>), governs the differentiation of adaptive immune cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mucida et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hall et al., 2011</a>), and facilitates the regeneration of epithelial barriers damaged by infection (<a href=\"#bib30\">Osanai et al., 2007</a>). A hallmark of vitamin A deficiency in humans is a markedly increased susceptibility to infection (<a href=\"#bib34a\">Sommer 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib40a\">Underwood, 2004</a>), underscoring the broad impact of retinol on immunity."

Despite the increased requirement for retinol, serum RBP is markedly reduced following microbial challenge (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rosales et al., 1996</a>), leaving open the question of how retinol is transported among tissues during infection."

SAAs are induced in intestinal epithelial cells by the microbiota (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ivanov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Reigstad et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Eckhardt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Reigstad and B\u00e4ckhed, 2010</a>), and have been implicated in promoting Th17 cell development in response to specific microbiota components (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ivanov et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, liver and serum SAAs are markedly elevated following systemic bacterial or viral infection (<a href=\"#bib26\">Meek and Benditt, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chiba et al., 2009</a>)."

Interestingly, SAAs have characteristics that suggest they could bind hydrophobic ligands. First, all SAAs are predicted to form amphipathic helices with a hydrophobic face that could interact with non-polar molecules (<a href=\"#bib37\">Stevens, 2004</a>). Second, SAAs circulate in the serum associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which transports lipid-bound lipoproteins amongst tissues (<a href=\"#bib45\">Whitehead et al., 1992</a>).

We demonstrate that SAA expression in mice requires dietary vitamin A, that mouse and human SAAs bind tightly to retinol, and that SAA recovered from serum following bacterial infection is associated with retinol. We find that <i>Saa1/2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, which harbor deletions of both the <i>Saa1</i> and <i>Saa2</i> genes, have higher bacterial burdens in spleen and liver following an acute bacterial infection, supporting an essential role for SAAs in the response to microbial challenge. Finally, we provide structural insight into the binding interaction by solving the mouse SAA3 crystal structure, which reveals a tetrameric assembly with a hydrophobic binding pocket that can accommodate retinol. These studies thus identify SAAs as a family of retinol binding proteins and reveal a new protein architecture supporting retinol binding. Our findings suggest that SAAs mediate retinol transport during microbial challenge and thus constitute a key component of the physiological response to infection."

Microarray analysis disclosed that mice fed a vitamin A-deficient diet exhibited lower abundances of serum amyloid A (<i>Saa</i>) 1 and 2 transcripts in the intestine as compared to mice fed a vitamin A-replete diet (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Real-time quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence analysis verified that expression of small intestinal SAA1, 2, and 3 was reduced in mice fed a vitamin A-deficient diet (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Liver expression of SAA1 and 2 was also reduced in mice fed a vitamin A-deficient diet, although the reduction in expression was less pronounced than in the intestine (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). This is likely because dietary vitamin A deficiency does not completely deplete stored retinoids in the liver (<a href=\"#bib22\">Liu and Gudas, 2005</a>). We also observed elevated expression of intestinal <i>Saa1</i> and <i>Saa2</i> following addition of retinol directly to the epithelial surface of small intestinal explants, and of liver <i>Saa1</i> and <i>Saa2</i> after intraperitoneal supplementation with retinoic acid (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These findings support the idea that retinoids directly impact <i>Saa</i> expression. Addition of retinol or retinoic acid to cultured HepG2 cells (a human liver cell line) enhanced expression of <i>SAA1</i> and <i>2</i> in the presence of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>), suggesting that the impact of dietary vitamin A on SAA expression is due to cell-intrinsic effects of retinoids. Collectively, these results show that full expression of SAAs in the intestine and liver requires dietary vitamin A."

We therefore measured retinoic acid binding using a modified fluorescence assay that monitored quenching of protein fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Titration of all<i>-trans</i> retinoic acid yielded K<sub>d</sub>s of 268 and 224 nM for retinoic acid binding to hSAA1 and mSAA3, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>), which are similar to binding affinities calculated for human RBP binding to retinoic acid (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cogan et al., 1976</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). There was weak binding of retinoic acid to mSAA1 and we were unable to calculate a K<sub>d</sub> for the interaction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). Thus, while hSAA1 and mSAA3 bind both retinol and retinoic acid, mSAA1 selectively binds retinol. mSAA1 also showed weak binding to other retinoids, including \u03b2-carotene and retinyl acetate, while hSAA1 bound these compounds with K<sub>d</sub>s of 497 and 347 nM, respectively, and mSAA3 bound \u03b2-carotene with a K<sub>d</sub> of 159 nM (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). All SAA isoforms bound weakly to retinyl palmitate (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Since long chain retinyl esters (such as retinyl palmitate) are the major form of stored retinoid in the liver (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vogel et al., 1999</a>), this suggests that SAAs do not transport retinoids for storage. Although a role for SAAs in cholesterol transport and metabolism has been proposed (<a href=\"#bib41\">van der Westhuyzen et al., 2005</a>), we found that cholesterol was unable to competitively inhibit retinol binding to SAAs (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>)."

Thus, the three-dimensional structures of CRBP and RBP proteins (<a href=\"#bib28\">Newcomer et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cowan et al., 1993</a>) provide no direct insight into the structural basis for retinol binding by SAAs. To understand how SAAs bind retinol, we therefore determined the three-dimensional structure of recombinant mSAA3 by X-ray crystallography. The protein was crystallized in a P6<sub>2</sub> space group with two subunits in the asymmetric unit, and the structure was determined to a resolution of 2 \u00c5 by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing using a selenomethionyl-derivatived crystal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The crystal structure reveals that mSAA3 is highly \u03b1-helical (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), as predicted on the basis of its primary sequence (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Stevens, 2004</a>). The structure is very similar to the recently determined structure of human SAA1.1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2014</a>), an isoform that has a marked tendency to form pathogenic amyloid fibrils (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yu et al., 2000</a>). Like the SAA1.1 structure, the mSAA3 structure consists of four \u03b1-helices, designated \u03b11-4 from the N- to the C-termini, forming a cone-shaped four-helix bundle with a comparatively longer \u03b11. The helices form two sets of antiparallel helices, \u03b11-\u03b12 and \u03b13-\u03b14, connected by a very short loop (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The monomer is stabilized by an extensive network of hydrogen bonding interactions among conserved residues and water molecules in the interior of the monomer. As in the SAA1.1 structure, the C-terminal tail wraps around the helix bundle making a number of hydrogen bonding interactions that add to monomer stability, underscoring the importance of the C-terminal tail."

Consistent with these findings, analysis of the mSAA3 crystal structure using the Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies (PDBePISA) server (<a href=\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/\">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/</a>) yielded a tetrameric quaternary structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). This is in contrast to the hexameric structure derived for SAA1.1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2014</a>). There are several potential reasons for the discrepancy in the oligomeric structures. First, it has been suggested that different SAAs can adopt different oligomeric states (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2011</a>). SAA1.1 was also observed to produce a \u223c43 kDa species in solution (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that SAA1.1 may in part adopt a tetrameric state. Second, SAA1.1 has a more hydrophobic N-terminus than mSAA3, which is thought to be a determinant of amyloidogenicity (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2014</a>). Third, the crystallized SAA1.1 protein retained the hexa-histidine tag (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2014</a>), which may have contributed to the difference in oligomeric state."

Thus, it requires a non-polar environment for transport among tissues and within cells. Structures of known retinol binding proteins, including serum RBP, indicate that these proteins consist mainly of \u03b2-sheet secondary structures forming a \u03b2-barrel tertiary structure, with the retinol molecule held in an interior non-polar binding pocket (<a href=\"#bib28\">Newcomer et al., 1984</a>). In contrast, mSAA3 is \u03b1-helical and oligomerizes to form a hollow, largely non-polar interior that could serve as a binding pocket for a non-polar small molecule (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We were unable to obtain mSAA3 crystals with the bound retinol ligand as retinol is highly unstable (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barua and Furr, 1998</a>) and the crystals required several weeks to grow. However, a ligand docking analysis using SwissDock (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grosdidier et al., 2011</a>) indicated that retinol can be docked in this hydrophobic pocket with favorable free energy (\u223c \u22127 kcal/mol) and FullFitness values (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zoete et al., 2010</a>) (\u223c \u22122400 kcal/mol) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013D</a>). Consistent with this prediction, introducing a Trp71Ala (W71A) mutation in the mSAA3 hydrophobic core reduced the affinity of mSAA3 for retinol (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Thus, the mSAA3 structure supports our biochemical data showing a retinol binding function for SAAs and explains how mSAA3 could bind retinol."

However, a prominent response to acute infection is the marked decline in serum RBP (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rosales et al., 1996</a>), which paradoxically occurs at a time of increased demand for retinol to support development of immunity and barrier defense. Thus, it has been unclear how retinol is transported among tissues following an acute microbial challenge."

SAA4 is 54\u201356% homologous to SAA1, 2, and 3, and retains the hydrophobic amino acids that are predicted to line the hydrophobic binding pocket in SAA3. Further, homology modeling using the mouse SAA3 structure and the mouse SAA4 sequences yields a SAA4 model with a highly similar predicted structure (alignment score of 0.1 and a Global Model Quality Estimate of 0.73). Thus, the possibility that SAA4 is a retinol binding protein that functions to transport retinol in healthy, non-infected animals will be a subject for future investigation."

Previous studies have suggested that SAAs promote Th17 cell development in response to specific components of the microbiota, such as segmented filamentous bacteria (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ivanov et al., 2009</a>). Consistent with a function for SAAs in retinol binding and transport, retinol/retinoic acid is required to elicit Th17 cell responses to infection and mucosal vaccination (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hall et al., 2011</a>). A key question is whether there are tissue-specific effects of intestinal epithelial SAAs, or whether the intestinal SAAs enter the circulation with bound retinol acquired directly from the diet. For example, intestinal epithelial SAAs could be involved in the direct delivery of retinol from epithelial cells to underlying immune cells in the lamina propria, or from epithelial cells to mucosal lymphoid tissues."

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500\u00d7<i>g</i> for 25 min at 4\u00b0C and re-suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidizole for mSAA1 and 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM imidazole, 15 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol for mSAA3). After sonication, decyl maltopyranoside (DM) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was added to a final concentration of 40 mM and incubated for \u223c3 hr at 4\u00b0C. The mixture was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7<i>g</i> for 30 min and the supernatant loaded onto a Ni<sup>2+</sup> metal affinity column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) pre-equilibriated with 4 mM DM in lysis buffer. Non-specific contaminants were washed away with 25 mM imidazole in DM buffer and the protein was eluted in DM buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. All subsequent buffers do not include detergent in order to completely remove detergent. The eluate was desalted with a HiTrap desalting column (GE Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) into a 200 mM NaCl buffer. Thrombin (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was then added (\u223c1 unit/1.2 mg protein) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Undigested protein was removed by passing the overnight digest over Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity matrix, collecting only the flow through. The eluate was concentrated in a 3 K cutoff Amicon Ultra centrifugal device (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on either a HiLoad Superdex 200 or a Superdex 75 (10/30) column (GE Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA), in 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8, 15 mM a \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 5% glycerol. For crystallization, mSAA3 was concentrated to \u223c3 mg/ml."

Samples were then vortexed 30 s and 5 ml of hexane per 1 ml sample was added. Samples were vortexed for another 30 s and centrifuged at 1,000\u00d7<i>g</i> for 5 min and the top organic phase was dried in a nitrogen evaporator (Organomation Associates, Berlin, MA). Samples were prepared the day before the assay and stored at 80\u00b0C. Standard solutions were resuspended in ethanol and prepared fresh for every use. Standard curves were generated by spiking retinol or retinoic acid into 1 ml of 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and processed as for serum samples. Samples were resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of acetonitrile before injection. Compound levels were monitored by LC-MS/MS on an AB/Sciex (Framingham, MA) 4000 Qtrap mass spectrometer coupled to a Shimadzu (Columbia, MD) Prominence LC after a 20 \u03bcl injection. The compounds were detected using electrospray ionization (ESI) with the mass spectrometer in MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) mode by following the precursor to fragment ion transition 269.2 \u2192 93.1 and 269.2 \u2192 119 for retinol (pos. mode; [M-H<sub>2</sub>O]<sup>+</sup>) and 301.2 \u2192 123.1 for retinoic acid (pos. mode; M+H<sup>+</sup>).

Over a total run time of 18 min, the following gradient was applied: 0 to 3 min 50% B; 3 to 10 min gradient to 100% B; 10 to 17 min 100% B; 17 to 18 min gradient to 50% B. Stoichiometries of the SAA-retinol association were determined by quantifying serum retinol and serum SAA. Total serum retinol was calculated based on peak areas from the mass spectrometer analysis in samples compared to a retinol standard curve. Serum SAA was quantified by Western blot analysis with anti-SAA antiserum and densitometry."

Immunol<i>.</i>, vol. 190, p. 2178-2187), which could explain the lowered abundance of granzyme transcripts (GzmA and GzmB) in the vitamin A-deficient mice. More interestingly, the array unexpectedly revealed that expression of three mucus-modifying glycosyltransferases (Fut2, Gcnt1, and B3galt5) is sensitive to dietary vitamin A, suggesting that vitamin A status could impact mucus glycan structure. The potential significance of the increased abundance of sodium:hydrogen antiporter (Slc9a3) transcripts is less apparent as there are no prior reports of its transcriptional regulation by retinoids. We have now added a comment about these findings to the legend of <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>."

When we challenge the <i>Saa1/2</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice orally with <i>S. typhimurium</i>, we detect no statistically significant differences in luminal colonization levels or dissemination to mucosal or systemic sites, as might be predicted by the presence of intestinal SAA3 in these mice. Ongoing work is focused on generating mice that lack all SAA isoforms, as these will likely produce better insight into the role of SAAs in immunity to mucosal infections."

SAA5 (now designated as mouse SAA4, and equivalent to SAA4 in humans) is expressed in the livers of uninfected mice and humans and secreted into the bloodstream at concentrations of \u223c50 ug/ml. This is well below the concentrations of &gt;1 mg/ml that are observed for SAA1 and SAA2 after acute infection, but similar to the serum concentrations of retinol binding protein in healthy individuals. SAA4 shows 54-56% homology to SAA1, 2, and 3, so it is more distantly related. However, it retains the hydrophobic amino acids that are predicted to line the hydrophobic binding pocket in SAA3. Further, we performed homology modeling using the mouse SAA3 structure and the mouse SAA4 sequence that yielded a SAA4 model with a highly similar predicted structure. We therefore predict that SAA4 is also a retinol binding protein. If so, it is possible that SAA4 functions in retinol transport in healthy, non-infected animals. We have added additional text discussing this point to the Discussion section."

Supporting this idea, elevated serum SAA levels have been observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (e.g., Arthritis Res 2, 142-144). We speculate that SAAs mediate retinol transport during such inflammatory states just as they do during infection, and plan to investigate this possibility in our future studies."
