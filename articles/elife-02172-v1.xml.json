Yet, this death process is silent, and it does not cause inflammation. The molecular mechanisms underlying anti-inflammatory nature of the apoptotic process remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that the culture supernatant of apoptotic cells activated the macrophages to express anti-inflammatory genes such as <i>Nr4a</i> and <i>Thbs1</i>. A high level of AMP accumulated in the apoptotic cell supernatant in a Pannexin1-dependent manner. A nucleotidase inhibitor and A2a adenosine receptor antagonist inhibited the apoptotic supernatant-induced gene expression, suggesting AMP was metabolized to adenosine by an ecto-5\u2019-nucleotidase expressed on macrophages, to activate the macrophage A2a adenosine receptor. Intraperitoneal injection of zymosan into <i>Adora2a-</i> or <i>Panx1-</i>deficient mice produced high, sustained levels of inflammatory mediators in the peritoneal lavage. These results indicated that AMP from apoptotic cells suppresses inflammation as a \u2018calm down\u2019 signal."

Yet, this death process is silent, and it does not cause inflammation. The molecular mechanisms underlying anti-inflammatory nature of the apoptotic process remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that the culture supernatant of apoptotic cells activated the macrophages to express anti-inflammatory genes such as <i>Nr4a</i> and <i>Thbs1</i>. A high level of AMP accumulated in the apoptotic cell supernatant in a Pannexin1-dependent manner. A nucleotidase inhibitor and A2a adenosine receptor antagonist inhibited the apoptotic supernatant-induced gene expression, suggesting AMP was metabolized to adenosine by an ecto-5\u2019-nucleotidase expressed on macrophages, to activate the macrophage A2a adenosine receptor. Intraperitoneal injection of zymosan into <i>Adora2a-</i> or <i>Panx1-</i>deficient mice produced high, sustained levels of inflammatory mediators in the peritoneal lavage. These results indicated that AMP from apoptotic cells suppresses inflammation as a \u2018calm down\u2019 signal."

PtdSer is a phospholipid that localizes to the inner leaflet of plasma membranes in healthy cells; however, when cells undergo apoptosis, it is exposed on the outer cell surface in a caspase-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fadok et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Leventis and Grinstein, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Suzuki et al., 2013</a>). Macrophages express membrane proteins that function as receptors for PtdSer (e.g., Tim-4, stabllin 2, and BAI1), or opsonins that bind to PtdSer (e.g. MFG-E8, Protein S, and Gas6) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nagata et al., 2010</a>).

Using <i>Thbs1</i> gene expression as a marker, the molecule responsible for the gene expression was identified as AMP. The overexpression of Pannexin 1 in apoptotic cells accelerated the accumulation of AMP in the culture supernatant of apoptotic cells, while a caspase-resistant form of Pannexin 1 inhibited the AMP accumulation. An inhibitor of ecto-5\u2032-nucleotidase blocked the AMP-induced activation of the <i>Thbs1</i> gene in macrophages, while macrophages from A2a adenosine receptor (<i>Adora2a</i>)-deficient mice did not respond to AMP. These results indicated that AMP from apoptotic cells was converted to adenosine by an ecto-5\u2032-nucleotidase on macrophages, and that the adenosine activated a set of genes in macrophages via the A2a adenosine receptor. Mice deficient in <i>Adora2a</i> or <i>Panx1</i> exhibited prolonged peritonitis following intraperitoneal zymosan injection, suggesting that the AMP released from apoptotic peritoneal cells exerted an anti-inflammatory effect by activating the A2a adenosine receptor."

To investigate this possibility, we examined the effect of the culture supernatant from apoptotic cells on macrophage gene expression. Mouse WR19L transformants expressing Fas (W3 cells) were treated with Fas ligand (FasL) for 30 min, washed, and then further incubated for 60 min. Following FasL treatment, more than 90% of the W3 cells were Annexin V positive, and only small percentage were positive for both Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that the majority of cells had undergone apoptosis but not necrosis. Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were then incubated for 1 hr with the supernatant of FasL-treated W3 cells, and subjected to microarray analysis. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, the mRNA levels of <i>N-myc (Mycn)</i>, <i>Nr4a</i> orphan nuclear receptor family members, <i>Egr</i> transcription factors (<i>Egr2</i> and <i>Egr3</i>), <i>Thrombospondin 1</i> (<i>Thbs1</i>), and <i>Il-1\u03b2</i> were 15- to 200-fold higher in the macrophages treated with apoptotic cell supernatant than in the control, untreated macrophages. A real-time RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the supernatants of apoptotic cells but not of healthy cells strongly induced the expression of <i>Nr4a1</i>, <i>Nr4a2,</i> and <i>Thbs1</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). When W3 cells were treated with FasL in the presence of Q-VD-OPh, a caspase inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib7\">Caserta et al., 2003</a>), the ability of the supernatant to upregulate the <i>Thbs1</i> gene was abrogated, indicating that the factor(s) responsible for upregulating <i>Thbs1</i> gene were generated in a caspase-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thbs1 and Nr4a are known to suppress inflammation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lopez-Dee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">McMorrow and Murphy, 2011</a>), and a danger signal such as ATP is unlikely to activate these genes."

To examine whether these events were involved in the apoptotic supernatant activity, the release of adenine nucleotides from apoptotic cells was followed over time. W3 cells were treated with FasL, and aliquots of the culture supernatant were collected at different time points and analyzed by LC-MS. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, healthy cells secreted low levels of AMP, whereas FasL-induced apoptosis caused a gradual increase of AMP in the supernatant. At 2 hr after the addition of FasL, the AMP level had increased to more than 4 \u03bcM in a culture of 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml. The concentration of ADP also increased, but was less pronounced compared with that of AMP. In contrast, at 2 hr the concentration of ATP was substantially lower, 40 nM or 40 pmoles per 10<sup>7</sup> cells. In various apoptosis systems, the intracellular ATP level is reported to remain high (<a href=\"#bib17\">Eguchi et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bossy-Wetzel et al., 1998</a>). However, the intracellular concentration of ATP in the FasL-treated W3 cells rapidly decreased, whereas the concentrations of ADP and AMP concomitantly increased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), suggesting that AMP was directly released from apoptotic cells. Exogenously added ATP was slowly degraded in the supernatant of FasL-treated W3 cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) providing additional support that AMP was released directly from the apoptotic cells, and not extracellularly converted from ATP. When mouse thymocytes in a culture of 1 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml were treated with FasL for 90 min to induce apoptosis in approximately 70% of the cells (8% were PI positive), the culture supernatant was found to contain 3.5 \u03bcM AMP, whereas the supernatant of healthy cells cultured for 1 hr contained approximately 0.2 \u03bcM AMP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Consistent with our finding using W3 cells, the levels of ATP and ADP in the FasL-treated thymocyte were 40 and 100 times lower than that of AMP, respectively. These results further suggest that AMP was directly released from primary thymocytes undergoing apoptosis."

(2010)</a> reported that Pannexin 1 is cleaved by caspase in apoptotic cells and mediates the release of ATP from these cells. Pannexins are a family of plasma membrane channel proteins consisting of 3 members (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baranova et al., 2004</a>). W3 cells and thymocytes expressed <i>Panx1</i>, but not <i>Panx2</i> or <i>Panx3</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A synthetic derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid (CBX, carbenoxolone), an inhibitor of Pannexin and Connexin channels (<a href=\"#bib14\">D\u2019Hondt et al., 2009</a>), inhibited the release of adenine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, and ATP) from FasL-treated W3 cells, whereas gadolinium chloride (GdCl<sub>3</sub>), an inhibitor of the maxi-anion channel, failed to inhibit their release from the apoptotic cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Mouse Pannexin 1 contains a caspase 3 recognition sequence (Asp-Ile-Ile-Asp) at amino acids 375 to 378. Therefore, we established W3 cells expressing wild-type or caspase-resistant Pannexin1 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, W3 transformants expressing wild-type Pannexin 1 released significantly higher levels of adenine nucleotides than the parental W3 cells upon FasL treatment. The caspase 3 recognition sequence of Pannexin 1 was then mutated to a caspase-resistant sequence (Ala-Ile-Ile-Ala). When W3 cells were transformed with the caspase-resistant form of Pannexin 1, the transformants completely lost their ability to release adenine nucleotides following FasL treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating that the caspase cleavage of Pannexin 1 was required for the release of adenine nucleotides. Co-culturing BMDM with FasL-treated W3 cells upregulated the <i>Thbs1</i> gene expression in BMDMs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), this was not observed when the W3 cells were transformed with the caspase-resistant form of pannexin1.

For instance, extracellular ATP regulates the microglial response to brain injury via P1 or P2 purinergic receptors (<a href=\"#bib15\">Davalos et al., 2005</a>), and adenosine modulates sleep\u2013wake cycles via A2a adenosine receptor (<a href=\"#bib53\">Urade et al., 2003</a>). Although the release of adenine nucleotides mainly occurs by exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pascual et al., 2005</a>), it is also mediated by transport via channel proteins. Connexins, which form gap junctions, can serve as hemichannels, and allow ATP to exit (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cotrina et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Spray et al., 2006</a>). Pannexins, which carry 4 transmembrane regions with intracellular N- and C-terminal tails, are structurally similar to connexins and also form hemichannels (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yen and Saier, 2007</a>). Various physiological and pathological stimuli such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx, shear stress, and apoptotic cell death, can cause Pannexin 1 channels to open, allowing the passage of molecules smaller than 1.0 kDa (<a href=\"#bib14\">D\u2019Hondt et al., 2009</a>). <a href=\"#bib9\">Chekeni et al.

The ATP concentration in healthy cells is approximately 10\u201350 times higher than that of AMP. However, when cells undergo apoptosis, ATP is quickly hydrolyzed to AMP, while its generating system is inactivated by caspases (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ricci et al., 2004</a>). The caspase-cleaved Pannexin channel also contributes to the cellular loss of ATP by allowing ATP to exit cells through the plasma membrane. Thus, the AMP found in apoptotic cell supernatants could have been extracellularly converted from ATP by E-NTPDase. However, the ability of apoptotic or healthy W3 cell supernatants to hydrolyze ATP was very low, suggesting that E-NTPDase was not responsible for the accumulation of AMP in the apoptotic cell supernatants. Thus, it is possible that AMP generated intracellularly in apoptotic cells was released from through these channels."

Since macrophages ingesting apoptotic cells produce TGF\u03b2 or IL-10 that inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines (<a href=\"#bib55\">Voll et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fadok et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lucas et al., 2006</a>), this interaction and/or engulfment was thought to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect. Furthermore, <a href=\"#bib29\">K\u00f6r\u00f6sk\u00e9nyi et al. (2011)</a> recently reported that macrophages engulfing apoptotic cells released adenosine to suppress inflammation. In contrast, we show here that apoptotic cells secrete AMP, which is converted to adenosine, resulting in macrophage activation via adenosine receptors, followed by the upregulation of <i>Thbs</i>1 and <i>Nr4a</i> gene expression. When the apoptotic cells could not release AMP due to the expression of caspase-resistant form of pannexin 1, the <i>Thbs1</i> gene expression was not up-regulated. Furthermore, the AMP released from the resident peritoneal macrophages engulfing apoptotic cells was significantly smaller than that released from apoptotic cells (HY, and SN, data not shown). These results suggest that the contribution of the interaction of apoptotic cells with macrophages to anti-inflammatory effect may not be great. Thbs1 is the major activator of TGF\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Crawford et al., 1998</a>), whereas Nr4a family members inhibit the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL-8, and IL-6 in macrophages (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bonta et al., 2006</a>), by recruiting a repressor complex to their promoter (<a href=\"#bib44\">Saijo et al., 2009</a>).

To address the above question, we treated the parental W3 and the W3 cell transformants expressing the caspase-resistant pannexin1, and co-cultured for 1 h with Bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDM). The Thbs1 gene expression in BMDM was then quantified by real-time PCR, and was found that BMDM co-cultured with the FasL-treated wild-type W3 cells strongly express Thbs1. But, this was not observed when BMDM was co-cultured with FasL-treated W3 cells expressing the caspase-resistant form of Pannexin 1. The result was shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> of the revised manuscript and explained."

The macrophages were thoroughly washed with medium to remove apoptotic cells, and cultured for 5 h. The AMP level increased in the supernatant was about 30 nM, corresponding to 30 pmoles per 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells. This value is significantly lower than that produced by apoptotic cells (7 nmols per 10<sup>7</sup> cells) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This point was briefly mentioned in the Discussion."
