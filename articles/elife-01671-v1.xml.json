We present FCS and STED experiments showing that dense membrane bound actin networks have severe influence on lipid phase separation. A minimal actin cortex was bound to a supported lipid bilayer via biotinylated lipid streptavidin complexes (pinning sites). In general, actin binding to ternary membranes prevented macroscopic liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domain formation, even at low temperature. Instead, depending on the type of pinning lipid, an actin correlated multi-domain pattern was observed. FCS measurements revealed hindered diffusion of lipids in the presence of an actin network. To explain our experimental findings, a new simulation model is proposed, in which the membrane composition, the membrane curvature, and the actin pinning sites are all coupled. Our results reveal a mechanism how cells may prevent macroscopic demixing of their membrane components, while at the same time regulate the local membrane composition."

We present FCS and STED experiments showing that dense membrane bound actin networks have severe influence on lipid phase separation. A minimal actin cortex was bound to a supported lipid bilayer via biotinylated lipid streptavidin complexes (pinning sites). In general, actin binding to ternary membranes prevented macroscopic liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domain formation, even at low temperature. Instead, depending on the type of pinning lipid, an actin correlated multi-domain pattern was observed. FCS measurements revealed hindered diffusion of lipids in the presence of an actin network. To explain our experimental findings, a new simulation model is proposed, in which the membrane composition, the membrane curvature, and the actin pinning sites are all coupled. Our results reveal a mechanism how cells may prevent macroscopic demixing of their membrane components, while at the same time regulate the local membrane composition."

The most prominent concept for membrane organization, the lipid raft theory, relates lipid phase separation (driven by interactions between cholesterol, sphingolipids, and saturated phospholipids) to membrane protein partitioning and regulation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Simons et al., 2011</a>). Consequently, understanding lipid phase separation in membranes is a topic of extreme interest. A convenient starting point is to envision the membrane as a two-dimensional (2D) fluid environment through which the various membrane components freely diffuse. This simple picture successfully captures ternary model membranes containing two phospholipid species and cholesterol. At low temperature, these systems macroscopically phase separate into liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) domains (<a href=\"#bib51\">Veatch and Keller, 2003</a>) and the nature of the transition is consistent with that of a 2D fluid (<a href=\"#bib17\">Honerkamp-Smith et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2009</a>). Similar behavior was observed in plasma membrane-derived vesicles (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baumgart et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sezgin et al., 2012</a>)."

For example, a remaining puzzle is that the Lo/Ld domains observed in model membranes grow macroscopic in size (micrometers), whereas lipid domains in plasma membrane are postulated to be tiny (nanometers) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lenne and Nicolas, 2009</a>). Additionally, the temperature <i>T</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> below which Lo/Ld domains start to form in plasma membrane derived vesicles is distinctly below T = 37\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sezgin et al., 2012</a>), and so its relevance at physiological temperature requires further justification. In the case of a free-standing membrane (i.e., in the absence of an actin cortex), experiments have shown that lipid domains at temperatures above <i>T</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> can be induced by crosslinking low abundant membrane constituents (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hammond et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lingwood et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, there are numerous theoretical proposals of how a finite domain size above <i>T</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> might be accounted for: vicinity of a critical point (<a href=\"#bib18\">Honerkamp-Smith et al., 2009</a>), hybrid lipids (<a href=\"#bib38\">Palmieri and Safran, 2013</a>), coupling between composition and membrane curvature (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schick, 2012</a>), electrostatic forces (<a href=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 2005</a>)."

The latter is a dense fiber network of actin and spectrin on the cytoplasmic side of the eukaryotic plasma membrane. This network is connected to the membrane via pinning sites, such as lipid-binding proteins, transmembrane proteins, or membrane-attached proteins (<a href=\"#bib22\">Janmey, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mangeat et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Janmey and Lindberg, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Saarikangas et al., 2010</a> ). This has led to the hypothesis of the membrane being laterally compartmentalized: the pinning sites structure the membrane into small compartments whose perimeters are defined by the underlying actin network (the so-called \u2018picket-fence\u2019 model). This picket-fence network then acts as a barrier to diffusion, which elegantly accounts for confined diffusion of lipids and proteins observed in a single molecule tracking experiments (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kusumi et al., 2005</a>). In a recent series of simulations, it was subsequently shown that a picket-fence network also acts as a barrier to macroscopic phase separation of lipids (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ehrig et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fischer and Vink, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Machta et al., 2011</a>). Instead, a stable mosaic of Lo and Ld domains is predicted, with a domain structure that strongly correlates to the actin fibers. Moreover, this mosaic structure already appears at physiological temperatures. These simulation findings are promising in view of the lipid raft hypothesis, since rafts are postulated to be small, as opposed to macroscopic."

Based on our results, we propose an extension of the picket-fence model by including a coupling of the local membrane curvature to the membrane composition. Computer simulations of this extended model show that the pinning effect of the actin network is dramatically enhanced by such a coupling. These results imply that even a low density of pinning sites can induce significant structuring of lipids and proteins in the plasma membrane."

Such ternary mixtures are routinely used to approximate the complex lipid composition of the eukaryotic plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dimova et al., 2006</a>). The phase diagram for this system in the absence of actin is well known (<a href=\"#bib51\">Veatch and Keller, 2003</a>). For a large range of compositions this system reveals macroscopic Lo/Ld phase coexistence below the transition temperature <i>T</i><sub><i>c</i></sub>, while above <i>T</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> they are homogenously mixed. The size, shape, and the exact phase transition temperature of Lo/Ld domains depend on the specific model membrane system used. Domains grow largest in unsupported membranes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Honigmann et al., 2010</a>), they are smaller in Mica supported membranes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jensen et al., 2007</a>) and are below the diffraction limit on glass-supported membranes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Honigmann et al., 2013</a>). Depending on the composition, the transition to the coexistence region can be first-order, or continuous passing through a critical point. In the present work, we choose a composition ratio of (DOPC:DPPC:cholesterol) = (35:35:30) mol%, including 1 mol% of a biotinylated lipid (DOPE-biotin) to eventually connect the membrane to an actin network. To facilitate high-resolution microscopy flat, single membranes of that mixture were prepared on a Mica support. After membrane preparation the sample was heated to T = 37\u00b0C for 15 min to equilibrate the bilayer in the mixed phase. At this stage, the connector protein streptavidin was bound to the biotinylated lipid (but not yet to actin). After this preparation the membrane was slowly cooled and the distribution of the red fluorescent Ld-marker (DPPE-KK114) was determined by superresolution STED imaging. Visual inspection of images revealed that, upon cooling, there is a well-defined temperature at which Lo/Ld domains became visible (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This temperature is around <i>T</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> \u2248 28\u00b0C and thus marks the transition between the mixed one-phase state at high temperature, and the low-temperature two-phase coexistence state. This phase transition temperature is close but slightly decreased compared to the reported value for lipid vesicles made of the same mixture (<i>T</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> \u2248 30\u00b0C [<a href=\"#bib53\">Veatch et al., 2004</a>]). At <i>T</i><sub><i>c</i></sub>, domains were constantly forming and re-forming, implying that the line tension is small, and so the transition is close to critical. The transition from a one-phase to a Lo/Ld separated two-phase membrane can be analyzed more quantitatively via the cumulant <i>U</i><sub>1</sub> of the images (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for definition). In the one-phase region, <i>U</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>\u03c0</i>/2, whereas for a two-phase system <i>U</i><sub>1</sub> = 1 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Binder, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fischer and Vink, 2011</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <i>U</i><sub>1</sub> markedly dropped toward unity below <i>T</i><sub><i>c</i></sub>. Once the membrane enters the two-phase region, domains were seen to coarsen within a couple of minutes. The typical domain size <i>R</i> was obtained from the radial distribution function <i>g</i>(<i>r</i>) of the images. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <i>R</i> increased rapidly at <i>T</i><sub><i>c</i></sub>, from &lt;75 nm to &gt;200 nm, and continued to grow into the near micrometer range as the temperature was lowered further. These findings are consistent with atomic force microscopy experiments (<a href=\"#bib5\">Connell et al., 2013</a>), where the transition was shown to be continuous as well. The observation that the domains do not fully coalesce at low temperature (as opposed to free-standing membranes) can be attributed to the interaction of the membrane with the mica support (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jensen et al., 2007</a>). Our data do not allow the nature of the transition to be unambiguously identified. We emphasize, however, that this does not affect the overall conclusions of our work. All that we require is that the system without actin reveals two-phase coexistence at low temperatures."

The resulting binding sites strongly attract the Ld phase with a partitioning value of Lo% = 10 for DOPE-biotin (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The actin fibers were stained with a green fluorescent phalloidin. After the actin meshwork was bound to the membrane, the temperature was again decreased, and the distributions of the Ld marker DPPE-KK114 and the actin were imaged simultaneously using (superresolution) STED and (diffraction limited) confocal microscopy, respectively. Visual inspection of images (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) revealed that, with actin, domains already appeared at T \u2248 37\u00b0C. The spatial domain structure, however, was very different compared to the actin-free case. We observed a partitioning of the membrane into compartments of Lo-enriched domains, separated by \u2018channels\u2019 of Ld-enriched domains. These channels were clearly correlated to the actin fibers (middle row), as shown in the overlay (lower row). This correlation was analyzed quantitatively via the Pearson measure (PCC), which is an estimate of the colocalization between the Ld domains and the actin fibers (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for definition). In general, a large value PCC&gt;0 indicates a pronounced overlay of structures, PCC = 0 indicates randomly distributed objects, whereas PCC&lt;0 represents inverted features (i.e., anti-correlations). We observed that PCC is largest at low temperature, implying that the correlation between Ld domains and actin is strongest there (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). However, PCC remains finite at high temperatures also, with a significant correlation up to our highest accessible temperatures of T = 37\u00b0C, which is a stunning 9\u00b0C above <i>T</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> of the actin-free membrane. For T &gt; 28\u00b0C, the decrease of PCC is approximately linear. This decrease was caused by an increasingly even partitioning of the Ld-marker, and not by a redistribution of Ld domains away from the actin fibers (as follows from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, where correlated domains remain clearly visible at T = 37\u00b0C). In contrast to the actin-free case, our data suggest that there is no phase transition associated with the formation of the domain structure: Neither the cumulant nor the domain size revealed any pronounced temperature dependence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Also the variation of PCC with temperature is entirely smooth, and does not indicate a transition either. Furthermore, in the presence of actin, the average domain size was significantly smaller, R \u2248 90 nm at most, and no coarsening was observed. Our conclusion is that the phase transition of the actin-free membrane is effectively eliminated by the actin network, in line with theoretical expectations (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fischer and Vink, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Machta et al., 2011</a>)."

                                "text": "To determine the lateral movement of lipids in the membrane in relation to the actin fibers, we applied scanning FCS (<a href=\"#bib7\">Digman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ries and Schwille, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Digman and Gratton, 2009</a>). We used the same system as described above, but now with a lower density of actin such that single fibers could be resolved by confocal microscopy. The temperature was set to T = 32\u00b0C, that is slightly above <i>T</i><sub><i>c</i></sub> of the actin-free membrane. As a control, we started with actin fibers on a single component DOPC membrane including 1 mol% DOPE-biotin (compare <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). A small circle (diameter d = 500 nm) was scanned over a single actin fiber, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>. For each position on the circle, the diffusion of the Ld-marker was determined by standard FCS analysis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2007</a>). The upper panel in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows the intensity of the Ld-marker (red) and of the actin marker (green) along the scan circle for the single component membrane (A). The intensity maximum of the green channel indicates the position of the actin fiber (corresponding to 0 and 180\u00b0), the intensity of the red channel shows the corresponding distribution of the Ld marker. In the single component membrane, the Ld marker was homogenously distributed. The lower panels of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows the decay of the autocorrelation function of the Ld marker measured along the scan circle, with the color representing the amplitude of the correlation. For the single component membrane, the autocorrelation analysis revealed no significant differences in mobility between areas with actin and without. Next, we used the same data to determine the diffusion of lipids across the scanning circle by calculating the pair-correlation function of \u2018opposing\u2019 pixels on the scanning circle, that is pixel pairs that are separated by a rotation of 180\u00b0 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cardarelli et al., 2012</a>). This correlation measures how long the probe on average needs to diffuse across the circle and is therefore more sensitive to detect diffusion barriers than the autocorrelation analysis of a single excitation spot. The resulting pair-correlation is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>. For the single component membrane, the amplitude and correlation time revealed no clear directional dependence. The average correlation time across the circle was \u03c4 \u2248 30 ms, indicating that the pinning of the actin filament imposed no significant diffusion barrier for lipids. These results are in agreement with point FCS measurements on single component membranes in the presence of increasing actin densities, which are reported in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>. Also here, the lateral diffusion was remarkably insensitive to the presence of actin."

To this end, we compared three biotinylated lipids with different partitioning values: DOPE-biotin (i.e., the same as used in the experiment of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) that partitions strongly into the Ld phase (Lo% = 11 \u00b1 2), DSPE-PEG-biotin that partitions predominantly in the Lo phase (Lo% = 78 \u00b1 7), and DPPE-biotin that partitions almost equally in both phases (but with a small preference toward the Lo phase, Lo% = 59 \u00b1 5). The experimental procedure to determine the Lo% is outlined in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, we show confocal images of the domain structure for the Ld-preferring pinning lipid DOPE-biotin. The figure confirms the previous experiment of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>: We again observe the formation of Ld domains along the actin fibers, as expressed by a positive Pearson coefficient PCC = 0.55 \u00b1 0.02. Pinning of the Lo-preferring lipid DSPE-PEG-biotin induced an \u2018inverted\u2019 domain structure, yielding a negative PCC = \u22120.37 \u00b1 0.04 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The binding of actin to DPPE-biotin did not result in a strong localization of lipid domains along the fibers, as manifested by a small \u2018but positive\u2019 PCC = 0.07 \u00b1 0.03 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The result of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> is surprising, since DPPE-biotin slightly prefers the Lo phase, and so a \u2018negative\u2019 PCC was expected. Notwithstanding that several mechanisms could be responsible for this (e.g., streptavidin binding to biotinylated lipids may induce lipid disorder by steric or electrostatic interactions with the membrane), it is interesting that a coupling between membrane composition and curvature also brings about this effect. To illustrate this point, we resort to computer simulations, where important parameters such as pinning density and phase partitioning of pinning sites can be systematically varied."

The first term describes the membrane elastic properties using the Helfrich form (<a href=\"#bib13\">Helfrich, 1973</a>), with bending rigidity <i>\u03ba</i>, and surface tension <i>\u03c3</i>, the second term describes the phase separation using a conserved order parameter Ising model; the third term couples the phases to the local membrane curvature. The strength of the curvature coupling is proportional to the product of <i>\u03ba</i> and the spontaneous curvature difference between Lo and Ld domains (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Since there is a substantial range in the experimentally reported values of <i>\u03ba</i> and <i>\u03c3</i>, a large uncertainty (about one order of magnitude) in the strength of the curvature coupling is implied (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schick, 2012</a>). For this reason, we allow the curvature coupling strength to be scaled by a (dimensionless) factor <i>g</i> in our analysis. The latter is defined such that, for <i>g &gt;</i> 0, regions of positive curvature favor unsaturated lipids, that is Ld domains. For <i>g</i> = 0 our model reduces to the one of <a href=\"#bib34\">Machta et al. (2011)</a>. In situations where curvature coupling is known to occur, one should restrict <i>g</i> to finite positive values. The influence of the actin network is incorporated via (immobile) pinning sites, which are distributed randomly along the actin fibers (linear pinning density <i>\u03c1</i><sub><i>p</i></sub>). At the pinning sites, there is a preferred energetic attraction to one of the lipid species (set by the Lo%). The pinning sites also locally fix the membrane height <i>h</i>, which we model by keeping <i>h</i> = 0 at these locations (we assume the actin network to lie in a flat plane, providing the reference from which the membrane height is measured). Additionally, there is a steric repulsion between the membrane and the actin: directly underneath the actin fibers, the membrane height is restricted to negative values <i>h &lt;</i> 0."

Interestingly, the corresponding experiment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) revealed a positive PCC, implying a weak alignment of Ld domains along the actin fibers instead. This contradiction can be rationalized, however, when one considers the membrane curvature. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, we show how the simulated PCC varies with the curvature coupling parameter <i>g</i>, using pinning density <i>\u03c1</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> = 0.1/nm, corresponding to 20% of the total actin network being pinned. The key observation is that, at <i>g</i> \u2248 20, the PCC changes sign and crosses the experimental value. We emphasize that the simulation data were not corrected for the optical point spread function (PSF) of the experiment; by artificially broadening the simulation images, lower values <i>g</i> \u223c 10 were obtained, precluding a precise determination. In addition, the value of <i>g</i>, where the PCC changes sign also depends on the pinning density: by increasing <i>\u03c1</i><sub><i>p</i></sub>, also <i>g</i> must increase to result in a positive PCC. In qualitative terms, the change of sign in the PCC reflects a competition between two effects: an energetic attraction between DPPE-biotin and saturated lipids, favoring alignment of Lo domains, vs a curvature-induced repulsion of these lipids away from the actin fibers. Due to the steric repulsion between the membrane and the actin fibers, the preferred curvature around the fibers is positive on average, thereby favoring Ld domains. At large <i>g</i>, the latter effect dominates, yielding a positive Pearson coefficient. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, we show a typical snapshot corresponding to <i>g</i> = 20 and <i>\u03c1</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> = 0.1/nm. In agreement with the experiment of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, we observe a structure of small domains. In contrast, by using <i>g</i> = 0, the domains grow to be much larger (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), contradicting the experimental observations."

Previous simulations corresponding to <i>g</i> = 0 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ehrig et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Machta et al., 2011</a>) required rather large pinning densities, <i>\u03c1</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> \u223c 0.2 \u2212 1.25/nm, in order to achieve this. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, we show a typical domain structure using DOPE-biotin pinning sites (Lo% = 11 \u00b1 2) at pinning density <i>\u03c1</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> = 0.1/nm in the absence of coupling to curvature (<i>g</i> = 0). <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> shows the corresponding snapshot in the presence of curvature coupling, using <i>g</i> = 20, which is the value of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a> where the PCC changed sign. To reproduce the experimentally observed domain structure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) at low pinning densities, curvature coupling is thus essential.

Note, however, that the experimental value likely presents an upper-bound, due to broadening by the PSF. The case of DSPE-PEG-biotin pinning sites (Lo% = 78 \u00b1 7) is considered in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,F</a>. Again, curvature coupling is required to reproduce the (now inverted) domain structure of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In the presence of curvature coupling, the length scale over which the effect of a pinning site propagates is thus enhanced dramatically. This is due to the elastic properties of the membrane: the bending rigidity and the surface tension define a length <i>\u03be</i><sub><i>h</i></sub> = (<i>\u03ba</i>/<i>\u03c3</i>)<sup>1/2</sup> (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schick, 2012</a>), which sets the scale over which the membrane height deformations propagate (for our model parameters <i>\u03be</i><sub><i>h</i></sub> \u223c 100 nm). When <i>g</i> &gt; 0, this scale couples to the composition, in which case a reduced pinning density already suffices to induce domain alignment. We emphasize that <i>\u03be</i><sub><i>h</i></sub> is essentially independent of temperature, and so it is not necessary for the membrane to be close to a critical point."

The application of our model system to a single component liquid-disordered membrane shows that actin has only a minor influence on the lateral distribution and dynamics of lipids (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, as well as <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). In contrast, under the same conditions using a ternary membrane, the effects are dramatic. In particular, by binding actin using pinning sites that attract the Ld phase, earlier simulation predictions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ehrig et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fischer and Vink, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Machta et al., 2011</a>) could finally be put to a stringent test. In agreement with these simulations, our experiments confirm the absence of macroscopic phase separation in the presence of actin. Additionally, our experiments revealed the alignment of Ld domains along the actin fibers, leading to a channel-like domain structure very similar to structures observed in simulations (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ehrig et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fischer and Vink, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Machta et al., 2011</a>). Finally, in agreement with the simulations of <a href=\"#bib34\">Machta et al. (2011)</a>, the enhanced diffusion of unsaturated lipids along the Ld channels, and the hindered diffusion of these lipids in directions perpendicular, was confirmed. These findings demonstrate that relatively simple simulation models are capable to capture key essentials of lateral membrane organization and dynamics."

The paradox is that, for the latter type of pinning site, one still observes alignment of Ld domains along the actin fibers, albeit weak. This indicates that there must be additional mechanisms at play\u2014beyond the level of the pinning-lipid energetic interaction\u2014playing a role in the lateral organization of the membrane. As possible candidate for such a mechanism, we considered the local membrane curvature, and a coupling of the latter to the lipid composition (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schick, 2012</a>). A simulation model that incorporates these ingredients is able to reproduce the experimentally observed alignment of Ld domains, even when the pinning sites themselves energetically favor the Lo phase. The physical explanation is that the actin network locally induces regions with non-zero average curvature. The coupling of the curvature to the composition then causes these regions to prefer certain types of lipids. Provided the coupling is strong enough, it can overcome the pinning-lipid energetic interaction, which is how we interpret the experimental result. An additional finding is that, in the presence of curvature coupling, the effect of a pinning site extends over a much greater distance (set by the elastic properties of the membrane). Hence, the pinning density can be much lower compared to models where such a coupling is absent. We emphasize once more that curvature coupling is not the only conceivable mechanism that could account for our experimental findings. However, a recent experimental study (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kaizuka and Groves, 2010</a>) of membrane phase separation using intermembrane junctions did uncover a very pronounced curvature coupling, making this a likely candidate."

Our experiments show that the type of lipid domain selected to be stabilized depends sensitively on the properties of the pinning species. A similar phenomenon, albeit on a larger scale, was observed by crosslinking GM1 with cholera toxin B (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hammond et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lingwood et al., 2008</a>). Since the stabilized phase is determined by the properties of the pinning species, cells could locally sort their membrane components in this way. Moreover, this sorting mechanism persists to physiological temperatures, that is above the temperature of phase separation. At the same time, the pinning sites would naturally prevent the plasma membrane from phase separating at low temperatures. In the presence of curvature coupling, these effects are enhanced. We note that the proposed curvature effect in our experiments was likely limited by the Mica support. However, since the energy cost of lipid extraction far exceeds that of membrane de-adhesion from the support (<a href=\"#bib16\">Helm et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lipowsky and Seifert, 1991</a>), we still expect some effect. In free-standing membranes, or in cell membranes, the curvature-coupling is anticipated to be stronger. The recent findings of <a href=\"#bib24\">Kaizuka and Groves (2010)</a> seem to support this view."

The actual temperature directly over the membrane was measured by a small thermo-sensor (P605, Pt100, Dostmann electronic GmbH, Wertheim-Reicholzheim, Germany)."

                                "text": "All experiments were performed on a confocal custom-built STED microscope whose main features are depicted in <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>. The confocal unit of the STED nanoscope consisted of an excitation and detection beam path. Two fiber-coupled pulsed laser diode operating at \u03bbexc = 635 nm and \u03bbexc = 485 nm with a pulse length of 80 ps (LDH-P-635; PicoQuant, Berlin, Germany) were used for excitation of the green and far red fluorescence respectively. After leaving the fiber, the excitation beams were expanded and focused into the sample using an oil immersion objective (HCXPLAPO 100x, NA = 1.4, Leica Microsystems). The fluorescence emitted by the sample was collected by the same objective lens and separated from the excitation light by a custom-designed dichroic mirror (AHF Analysentechnik, Tuebingen, Germany). In the following, the fluorescence was focused onto a multi-mode fiber splitter (Fiber Optic Network Technology, Surrey, Canada). The aperture of the fiber acted as a confocal pinhole of 0.78 of the diameter of the back-projected Airy disk. In addition, the fiber 50:50 split the fluorescence signal, which was then detected by two single-photon counting modules (APD, SPCM-AQR-13-FC, Perkin Elmer Optoelectronics, Fremont, CA). The detector signals were acquired by a single-photon-counting PC card (SPC 830, Becker&amp;Hickl;, Berlin, Germany). The confocal setup was extended by integrating a STED laser beam. A modelocked Titanium:Sapphire laser (Ti:Sa, MaiTai, Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, USA) acted as the STED laser emitting sub-picosecond pulses around \u03bbSTED = 780 nm with a repetition rate of 80 MHz. The pulses of the STED laser were stretched to 250\u2013350 ps by dispersion in a SF6 glass rod of 50 cm length and a 120 m long polarization maintaining single-mode fiber (PMS, OZ Optics, Ontario, CA). After the fiber, the STED beam passed through a polymeric phase plate (RPC Photonics, Rochester, NY), which introduced a linear helical phase ramp 0 \u2264 \u03a6 \u2264 2\u03c0 across the beam diameter. This wavefront modification gave rise to the doughnut-shaped focal intensity distribution featuring a central intensity zero. The temporal synchronization of the excitation and STED pulses was achieved by triggering the pulses of the excitation laser using the trigger signal from an internal photodiode inside the STED laser and a home-built electronic delay unit, which allowed a manual adjustment of the delay with a temporal resolution of 25 ps. The circular polarization of the STED and excitation laser light in the focal plane was maintained by a combination of a \u03bb/2 and \u03bb/4 retardation plates in both beam paths (B Halle, Berlin, Germany). Integration of a fast scanning unit enabled rapid scanning of the excitation and STED beam across the sample plane. A digital galvanometric two mirror-scanning unit (Yanus digital scan head; TILL Photonics, Gr\u00e4feling, Germany) was used for this purpose. The combination of an achromatic scan lens and a tube lens in a 4f-configuration (f = 50 mm and f = 240 mm, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) realized a stationary beam position in the back aperture of the objective, preventing peripheral darkening within the focal plane at large scan ranges, such as vignetting. The maximal frequency of the Yanus scanner depended on the scan amplitude and varied between 2 and 6 kHz for scan amplitudes up to 150 \u00b5m, respectively. The hardware and data acquisition was controlled by the software package ImSpector (<a href=\"http://www.imspector.de/\">http://www.imspector.de/</a>)."

As a measure of the domain size <i>R</i>, we used the criterion <i>g</i>(<i>R</i>) = 0.5 \u00d7 <i>g</i>(0). The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between the actin and the lipid channels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) was calculated as the covariance of both channels divided by the product of the standard deviations of both channels. For each temperature up to 5 images from different parts of the sample were analyzed. Vesicles on top of the supported bilayer (which were visible in the lipid channel as round bright structures) were excluded from the analysis."

The maximum of the PCF yields an estimate of how long the fluorescent probes on average need to diffuse from <i>i</i> to <i>j</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Digman and Gratton, 2009</a>). To avoid crosstalk between the two excitation spots, the distance between pairs (i.e., the diameter of the scanning orbit) was at least twice the size of the observation spot. In case of free Brownian diffusion, the PCF is homogenous around the scan orbit. In case the diffusion is hindered by obstacles, the maximum of the PCF is shifted to longer times, and its amplitude is decreased."

The authors use a biotin/streptavidin coupling approach to attach actin filaments to model membranes that are supported by a mica sheet. Model membranes consist of a lipid mixture with the propensity to show liquid ordered/liquid disordered phase coexistence. The authors show clear evidence for alignment of domains along actin fibers that might provide a reasonable mechanism for the regulation of cellular lipid phase domain size and distribution. The authors use a couple of cutting edge techniques for arriving at their conclusions, including two-point time correlation analysis of fluorescence fluctuations and diffraction limit breaking optical imaging. The findings of the manuscript are impressive and important. Nevertheless, I have several comments, the consideration of which might further improve the contribution."

Such an interaction may lead to irreversible bilayer disruption after membrane binding. The authors mention that significant correlation between spatial distribution of actin as well as domain distribution was found at a temperature as high as 37 degrees, but unless I have overlooked it there does not appear to be a description of at what temperature bilayers with bound actin actually become homogeneous. I am therefore wondering if the bilayer is irreversibly disrupted through actin/mica support interactions, or if the bilayer remains intact and reversibly responds to temperature changes."

The term Hx, described in the supplement, however, also contains the bending stiffness and the difference of spontaneous curvature among the two phases. I would like to point out that the product of bending stiffness and spontaneous curvature difference already is the coupling parameter connecting curvature and local composition. This interpretation is consistent with the existing literature on curvature/composition coupling in membranes. The parameter g thus seems to be a (somewhat arbitrary) amplification factor that allows to dial up the interaction strength to make experimental data consistent with the simulations. I am not sure what the physical justification for this amplification factor is? In the absence of providing a physical justification, I would be forced to interpret g as a fudge factor."

If a second membrane is present on top of the first bilayer, in the second membrane domains will appear already at higher temperatures and they will coalesce similar to free standing membranes.

We therefore can estimate the temperature where the membrane would appear completely homogenous on our microscope to be T\u0334 45\u00b0C. This is in agreement with the simulations of Machta et al.

Also, it is not expected that there is a clear temperature threshold where the membrane becomes homogenous in case of actin pinning, because this transition is smooth, e.g., contrast and size of the stabilized domains just decreases as the temperature increases (see Machta et al., <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

However, the number of membranes can be controlled by the concentration of lipids in the spin coating solution. We performed a concentration row and inspected the resulting membranes on our microscope to find the right concentration for our experiments. At a lipid concentration of 2g/l usually the whole mica surface is covered with a single membrane and occasionally patches of 2-3 membranes. At lower lipid concentrations patches with no membrane are present. At higher concentrations multilayers are formed. The patches at 2g/l can be removed by controlled rinsing with a pipette. We do this step directly on the microscope to have a feedback how the membrane responds to the rinsing."

Of course, to compare to experiments where curvature coupling is known to occur, one should restrict g to positive finite values, as the referee points out.
