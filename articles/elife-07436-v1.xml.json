However, recent studies in non-human primates have shown that neural activity does not simply represent muscle or movement parameters; instead, its temporal structure is well-described by a dynamical system where activity during movement evolves lawfully from an initial pre-movement state. In this study, we analyze neuronal ensemble activity in motor cortex in two clinical trial participants diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We find that activity in human motor cortex has similar dynamical structure to that of non-human primates, indicating that human motor cortex contains a similar underlying dynamical system for movement generation."

However, recent studies in non-human primates have shown that neural activity does not simply represent muscle or movement parameters; instead, its temporal structure is well-described by a dynamical system where activity during movement evolves lawfully from an initial pre-movement state. In this study, we analyze neuronal ensemble activity in motor cortex in two clinical trial participants diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We find that activity in human motor cortex has similar dynamical structure to that of non-human primates, indicating that human motor cortex contains a similar underlying dynamical system for movement generation."

Some scientists believe that individual neurons in motor cortex send direct messages that tell the muscles which direction to move in, how fast, and how forcefully. But other scientists suggest that this is not the case. Instead, they propose that neurons in motor cortex work together as part of a dynamic system to create rhythmic patterns of activity for movement. These rhythmic patterns then sum together to create the signals that muscles need to carry out the movements."

These studies showed what appears to be a rotating set of patterns in neuronal activity in the motor cortex during movement. Now, Pandarinath et al. have shown that a similar rotation of neuronal activity patterns occurs during movement in two human volunteers. The participants both had a disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (or ALS for short). This disease had nearly paralyzed their arms and legs because it causes a progressive loss of muscle control. In the experiments, the volunteers used their index fingers to try to move a computer cursor to a target using a touch pad."

The experiments uncovered a predictable series of patterns that started when the individual first thought about moving. These patterns progressed in a rotation as the movement was carried out. The rotation was not tied to the direction of the movements and would be completely unexpected if the individual neurons were simply acting as direct messengers."

Though motor cortex has been extensively studied over the past century (<a href=\"#bib11\">Lemon, 2008</a>), the complexity of these patterns remains poorly understood. Early work demonstrated that neural firing correlates with external variables such as movement direction (<a href=\"#bib5\">Georgopoulos et al., 1982</a>), and an ongoing debate centers on whether the firing patterns represent muscle or movement parameters (e.g., joint position, intended velocity, reach endpoint, muscle forces, and so on; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib8\">Kalaska, 2009</a>). A recent approach has been to ask, instead, whether these patterns of activity reflect an internal dynamical system across the population (<a href=\"#bib4\">Fetz, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Churchland and Shenoy, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Scott, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Churchland et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Graziano, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Shenoy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Kaufman et al., 2014</a>). In this view, the system's initial state is set by preparatory activity, and consistent rules govern how firing rates evolve over time across movement conditions, regardless of movement direction or other externally changing variables."

Furthermore, at the population level, the responses are well-described by a simple dynamical model in which the population response (the neural state) rotates with time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Churchland et al., 2012</a>).

Next, we performed principal components analysis (PCA) on the high-dimensional population data. We restricted the data to the top 6 PCs, that is, we only preserved the six response patterns most strongly present in the data. Finally, for this reduced-dimensional data set, we applied the jPCA method (<a href=\"#bib2\">Churchland et al., 2012</a>), which searches the data for 2-dimensional planes that capture the strongest rotational tendencies.

As with macaques, rotations were consistent across conditions and followed naturally from an initial pre-movement state. As mentioned above, and in contrast to the macaque study, both participants in this study had a diagnosis of ALS with resultant motor impairment. Participant T7's movements in particular were very limited and occurred with a long latency following target onset (detailed in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Both participants likely had substantial changes in motor cortex due to their disease progression; therefore, these results do not conclusively show that dynamical activity is present in healthy human motor cortex. However, given the finding that dynamical activity is prominent in motor cortex in people with abnormal motor function, and given the similarity of this activity to that of healthy non-human primates, the results strongly suggest the presence of dynamical activity in human motor cortex in general and may also hint at which aspects of motor cortical function are preserved despite the progression of a severe motor neuron disease."

Recent studies (Feldman et al., Society for Neuroscience, 2011, 2012; Pandarinath et al., Society for Neuroscience, 2013) have demonstrated that motor cortex is active during both overt and imagined movements. If the functional role of rotational dynamics is to serve as an oscillatory basis set for generating muscle activation patterns (e.g. electromyogram activity) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Churchland et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Sussillo et al., 2015</a>), then one might expect these dynamics to be absent during imagined movements, when the subject is specifically trying to avoid generating motor output. However, if activity during imagined movements serves as a mechanism for the \u2018covert rehearsal\u2019 of activity during overt movements, then dynamics might still be present (but might be, for example, orthogonal to patterns of activity that drive motor output). Future studies will attempt to directly address this question."

Finally, as with macaques, the presence of these rotations calls into question the prevailing model of motor cortical activity (i.e., that motor cortical firing patterns represent muscle or movement parameters) in favor of a dynamical systems perspective in humans as well."

In the \u2018center-out\u2019 task, participants controlled the position of a cursor on a computer screen by making physical movements with their fingers on a wireless touchpad (Magic Trackpad; Apple, Cupertino, CA). The cursor began in the center of the screen, and targets would appear in one of 8 locations on the periphery. Participants then acquired the targets by moving the cursor over the target and holding it over the target for 500 ms. In contrast to the prior macaque study (<a href=\"#bib2\">Churchland et al., 2012</a>), the target acquisition task used in this work did not include a delay period. Therefore, participants were free to move as soon as the target appeared. Participant T6 was not limited in her ability to span the workspace of the touchpad.

We agree, understanding whether ensemble activity exhibits rotational dynamics during imagined movements is a very interesting scientific question. More broadly, we are interested in discerning the cognitive and neurophysiological correlates of imagined or intended movements in people with tetraplegia, and are pursuing this topic as part of our ongoing research. However, we feel this is beyond the scope of the current work. We believe, and the reviewers seem to agree, that the importance of the current short report is the clinical translation of a key finding from non-human primate studies. In contrast, we don't have a good prediction, based on the prior work, for whether motor cortex should show dynamical activity during imagined movements."

However, if activity during imagined movements serves as a mechanism for the \u201ccovert rehearsal\u201d of activity during overt movements, then dynamics might still be present (but might be, for example, orthogonal to patterns of activity that drive motor output). Due to the complexity of this issue, and the necessity for dedicated experiments and controls, we feel this is better addressed in a follow-on study than in this short report."

Nonetheless, we certainly agree that it is important to state the ethical review process that preceded and continues to accompany this research. We have added a sentence to the main text clarifying that this protocol was approved by multiple institutional review boards and is performed under an Investigational Device Exemption granted by FDA. We have also clarified the Methods regarding this point, and to note that these data were not collected solely for this purpose, but were collected as part of a pilot clinical study testing the safety and feasibility of an intracortical neural interface system (BrainGate, <a href=\"http://www.braingate2.org\">www.braingate2.org</a>) for people with tetraplegia. As part of this carefully performed clinical research, research participants contribute enormously by testing evolving algorithms for closed-loop neural cursor control and by providing feedback on the communication and external device control interfaces being developed for use by people with tetraplegia. In addition, the ability to chronically record motor cortical neuronal ensembles in people\u2014for years at a time\u2014provides a simultaneous and unprecedented opportunity to pose questions and to learn about the human nervous system, not only for its fundamental scientific benefits, but directly toward harnessing that knowledge toward the creation of advanced neural interfaces for people with neurologic disease."
