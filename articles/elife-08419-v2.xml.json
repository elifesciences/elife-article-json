A mechanistic understanding of the molecular events underlying signaling, however, has been hampered by the lack of a high-resolution structural description of the extended array. Here, we report a novel reconstitution of the array, involving the receptor signaling domain, histidine kinase CheA, and adaptor protein CheW, as well as a density map of the core-signaling unit at 11.3 \u00c5 resolution, obtained by cryo-electron tomography and sub-tomogram averaging. Extracting key structural constraints from our density map, we computationally construct and refine an atomic model of the core array structure, exposing novel interfaces between the component proteins. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we further reveal a distinctive conformational change in CheA. Mutagenesis and chemical cross-linking experiments confirm the importance of the conformational dynamics of CheA for chemotactic function."

A mechanistic understanding of the molecular events underlying signaling, however, has been hampered by the lack of a high-resolution structural description of the extended array. Here, we report a novel reconstitution of the array, involving the receptor signaling domain, histidine kinase CheA, and adaptor protein CheW, as well as a density map of the core-signaling unit at 11.3 \u00c5 resolution, obtained by cryo-electron tomography and sub-tomogram averaging. Extracting key structural constraints from our density map, we computationally construct and refine an atomic model of the core array structure, exposing novel interfaces between the component proteins. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we further reveal a distinctive conformational change in CheA. Mutagenesis and chemical cross-linking experiments confirm the importance of the conformational dynamics of CheA for chemotactic function."

Though the topology and complexity of the protein networks employed in bacterial chemotaxis vary by species, each uses the histidine kinase CheA (component 1) and response regulator CheY (component 2) to set up an intracellular phosphorylation cascade that regulates the motile behavior of the cell (<a href=\"#bib50\">Szurmant and Ordal, 2004</a>). CheA, in particular, is a multi-domain protein, consisting of five separate and functionally distinct domains (P1-P5): P1-phosphoryl transfer domain, P2-substrate binding domain, P3-dimerization domain, P4-kinase domain and P5-regulatory domain. In addition to CheA and CheY, an expanded set of molecules assist in the mechanics of signal reception, transmission, and regulation. Specifically, bacteria utilize dedicated chemoreceptors (also known as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, MCPs) to recognize ambient chemicals and transmit mechanical signals across the cell membrane to affect CheA kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ortega et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Parkinson et al., 2015</a>). The adaptor protein CheW universally participates in the coupling of conformational changes within receptors to kinase regulation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Szurmant and Ordal, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu and Parkinson, 1989</a>). Bacteria, moreover, have evolved the ability to tune or adapt their chemotactic sensitivity to stimulus intensity, giving rise to short-term molecular memory and allowing an appropriate system response over wide ranges of chemical concentrations (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hazelbauer and Lai, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Parkinson et al., 2015</a>). In the case of the model organism, <i>Escherichia coli,</i> the adaptation mechanism involves the use of two enzymes, CheR and CheB, which reversibly modify specific residues in the receptor molecules (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hazelbauer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hazelbauer and Lai, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Goy et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ortega et al., 2013</a>)."

Through the computational synthesis of existing X-ray crystallography data and our new cryoET data, we have constructed an atomic model of the extended chemosensory array.

Inspired by the template-directed method to assemble functional signaling complexes on lipid vesicles (<a href=\"#bib36\">Montefusco et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shrout et al., 2003</a>), we designed a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA lipid containing monolayer system (<a href=\"#bib52\">Taylor et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Taylor and Taylor, 1999</a>) to reconstitute the two-dimensional (2D) arrays of signaling complexes for structural analysis. To this end, we expressed and purified to high homogeneity <i>E. coli</i> chemotaxis proteins: CheA, CheW, and a His-tagged cytoplasmic signaling domain of the wild-type (wt) Tar receptor (TarCF). His-tagged TarCF can be readily incorporated into the Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA lipid monolayers, seen as homogeneous particles in the EM micrographs of negatively stained specimen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Only in the presence of all three components (TarCF, CheA, and CheW) were ordered arrays evident (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), and even then, these microcrystalline 2D arrays were only formed under strictly constrained input ratios of the three components, a finding that is consistent with previous results indicating that the chemotactic function of the complex is diminished when one of the components is reduced or over-produced (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>). The optimal condition for array formation was established to be a mixture of TarCF, CheA and CheW with a molar ratio of 9:18:18 \u03bcM for TarCF:CheA:CheW in a lipid monolayer containing 2:1 DOPC:DOGS-NTA-Ni<sup>2+</sup> lipids (33% Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA lipid). Notably, the input molar ratio of the reconstitution mixture does not reflect the actual ratio of components incorporated into the monolayer, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>. The resulting arrays are organized in hexagonal lattices with 12 nm spacing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> inset, white arrow), resembling the arrays formed in native cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Briegel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2012</a>)."

Using cryoET, we collected and reconstructed, correcting for the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the microscope (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2006</a>), 20 tomograms of monolayers containing reconstituted core-signaling complex arrays. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) shows a typical raw tomographic slice (without CTF correction) of a reconstituted monolayer, illustrating patches of 2D lattices with information extending beyond 22\u2009\u00c5 (inset, arrow). By extracting and classifying CTF-corrected sub-tomograms, centered on each hexagon of receptor TODs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, yellow circle), we obtained two major classes of the receptor hexagons: one containing a trimer of core-signaling units (CheA<sub>2</sub>-trimer, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, cyan boxes) and one containing a hexamer of core-signaling units (CheA<sub>2</sub>-hexamer, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, orange box). By mapping the individual sub-tomograms from the above two classes onto the original contributing tomograms, we were able to extract the extended lattice organization of the subunits in the monolayer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), revealing an interlocking of the CheA<sub>2</sub>-trimer and CheA<sub>2</sub>-hexamer classes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) consistent with that seen in cellular tomograms (<a href=\"#bib6\">Briegel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2012</a>)."

A uniform distribution of in-plane orientations of the sub-tomograms and a relatively well sampled, out-of-plane angle enhanced the quality of the averaged density maps (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B&amp;C</a>).

To take the effect of the anisotropic resolution into account, we low-pass filtered the density map according to the FSC of the Fourier conical shells along various directions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Diebolder et al., 2015</a>). The resulting maps of the CheA<sub>2</sub>-trimer and CheA<sub>2</sub>-hexamer clearly delineate the density regions corresponding to the receptor, the CheA-P5/CheW ring at the receptor tip, and CheA kinase domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B&amp;C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and further display a number of new features. In particular, the individual receptor dimers are thoroughly resolved, allowing the kinase and CheW/receptor interactions to be isolated to a specific receptor dimer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). Moreover, the position of the previously unobserved four-helix bundle of the CheA-P3 dimerization domain is clearly discerned to run parallel to the receptor and is positioned close to CheW-interacting receptor dimers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). In addition, our maps dramatically refine the area of density projecting below the CheA-P5 domain, suggesting that the CheA-P4 kinase domain alone occupies this density region (<a href=\"#fig2 fig3\">Figure 2B, 3A</a>, and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>).

This finding is in contrast to the previously described pseudo six-fold symmetry of the CheA-P5/CheW ring (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li and Bayas, 2013</a>). Most importantly, the previously described \u2018empty hexagon\u2019 that is surrounded by six CheA-occupied hexagons (<a href=\"#bib6\">Briegel et al., 2012</a>) is not empty, but rather contains a well-ordered continuous ring of densities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) that we were able to unambiguously assign to individual CheW monomers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D&amp;E</a>). This ring of CheW, as previously speculated (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2012</a>), provides additional interactions that couple neighboring receptor TODs and strengthens the interlocking baseplate. Hence, our maps confirm the existence of the CheW ring and establish its participation in the structural foundation responsible for the ultra-stability of the chemosensory array (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Erbse and Falke, 2009</a>) and for the high cooperativity and extraordinary sensitivity measured in chemotaxis responses (<a href=\"#bib17\">Goldman et al., 2009</a>)."

                                "text": "The resolution of our cryoET data permitted the unambiguous assignment of distinct regions of density to specific protein components, enabling the construction of all-atom models of the chemosensory array substructures and extended lattice (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A schematic overview of the modeling procedures carried out in this study is provided in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a> with a more detailed discussion of these procedures located in the Methods section. Briefly, we first constructed models of the receptor TOD, CheA-P3P4 dimer, CheA-P5/CheW ring, and CheW-only ring, taking advantage of existing high-resolution X-ray structures from the thermophilic bacterium <i>Thermotoga maritima</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim and Yokota, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bilwes et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Park et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Li and Bayas, 2013</a>). We then heuristically-arranged, using a 12 nm lattice constant, the resulting component models to produce models of the CheA<sub>2</sub>-trimer and CheA<sub>2</sub>-hexamer subunits identified by sub-tomogram classification (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D&amp;E</a>). To further refine the key protein-protein interfaces within our atomic models, we adopted a dual MD-based strategy, utilizing both unbiased MD and electron-density-biased molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) simulations (<a href=\"#bib53\">Trabuco et al., 2008</a>). For the subject of our unbiased refinement simulations, we extracted from the CheA<sub>2</sub>-hexamer model a portion corresponding to the array unit cell, including six receptor TODs, three CheA dimers, and 12 CheW monomers all together arranged as three coupled core-signaling units (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, herein the 'unit-cell model'). For our density-biased refinement simulations, we focused our efforts on the CheA<sub>2</sub>-trimer model, owing to the higher-resolution of its associated density map, and hence, better resolved MDFF biasing forces. Because the CheA-P4 density is not as well defined as the other parts of the complex, likely due to its conformational flexibility, we carried out a rigid-body docking of the CheA-P4 domain, starting from 10,000 random angular orientations and up to 20\u00a0\u00c5 shifts from the center of the mass. This fitting exercise resulted in 23 classes separated by 3\u00b0 and 3\u00a0\u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), generating a metric for the goodness of fit of the P4 domain positioning. In addition to the class of 'best fit'(<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>, panel 1), one other class, in which P4 is flipped relative to the best fit, was seemingly structurally possible (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>, panel 5). However, compared to the best-fit class, this alternative class had a lower cross-correlation value, lower occupancy with only a third the number of contributing fits, and the positions of P4-N and C termini are reversed (flipped), making it hard to connect the P3 and P5 termini with short linkers. Thus, we have focused our efforts and resources on the highest ranking class of P4 position. It should be noted, though, that use of the alternative P4 positioning might produce considerably different MD trajectories. Solvation and ionization of the unit cell and CheA<sub>2</sub>-trimer models produced systems of size 1.25 million and 1.75 million atoms, respectively, which were subsequently energy minimized and equilibrated for 10 ns, as described in the Methods section. The unit-cell model was then subjected to an 80 ns unconstrained production simulation (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), while a 70 ns symmetry-constrained MDFF simulation was used to computationally bias the tertiary structure of the protein components within the CheA<sub>2</sub>-trimer model according to our 11.3\u2009\u00c5 CheA<sub>2</sub>-trimer density map (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

For succinctness, specific residues participating in the various protein-protein interfaces within the array have been listed in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>. In addition, the equilibrated model of the <i>T. maritima</i> TOD maintained the conserved trimer-forming contacts observed in the X-ray structure of the <i>E. coli</i> serine receptor (Tsr) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim and Yokota, 1999</a>) and revealed two additional trimer-stabilizing salt bridges, namely E387/R389 (conserved as E402/R404 in <i>E. coli</i> Tsr) and E351/R403 (structurally homologous to D363/R415 in <i>E. coli</i> Tsr) (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>).

An overview of the key MD simulations conducted in this study is given in <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>. The unit cell system contains the minimal set of components needed to represent the full receptor signaling array, which was made possible through the use of periodic boundary conditions to mimic the bulk symmetry of the chemosensory array, preventing the need to interpret potentially problematic effects due to unconstrained boundaries (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). We conducted a series of nine simulations of 450 ns each, using the equilibrated unit-cell model; additionally, we ran ten, 120 ns simulations of the equilibrated CheA<sub>2</sub>-trimer system for comparison with the unit-cell simulations. Intriguingly, our simulations of both models revealed an ensemble of distinct core-signaling unit conformations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4 B&amp;C</a>), including structures in which the associated CheA dimer displayed either an undipped conformation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, top) or dipped conformation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, bottom). In the latter case, the P4 domain of one CheA monomer adopted a 'dipped' state through rotations about the P3-P4 and P4-P5 flexible linkers, significantly affecting its contacts with neighboring receptor dimers and the P5 domain (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). As many biochemical, biophysical, and mutational studies have implicated dynamic structural changes within these regions of the core-signaling unit during the propagation of signals (<a href=\"#bib45\">Piasta et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Natale et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Briegel et al., 2013</a>), we systematically identified the distinct structural classes of core-signaling unit conformations present in our MD simulations and isolated them for comparative analysis. Specifically, we used the UPGMC hierarchical clustering method (<a href=\"#bib37\">M\u00fcllner, 2013</a>) to assign the conformations of the 27 core-signaling units sampled in our unit cell simulations (3 units/unit cell) to groups of similar structure based on their pairwise root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). Cross-examination of structures within the resulting core-signaling unit clusters revealed the formation of two new salt bridges stabilizing the 'dipped' state, namely R297/E397 (R265/E368 in <i>E.</i> coli) between the P3 and P4 domains and E390/R379 (E361/R394 in <i>E. coli</i>) between the P4 domain and nearby receptor tip (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, bottom). Moreover, to accommodate the reorientation of the P4 domain, the P3 dimerization bundle was observed to break the receptor contacts (D333/K390 and D345/R379) observed in the \u2018undipped\u2019 state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), suggesting that the mobility of the P3 bundle plays a key role in the conformational dynamics of the CheA dimer."

For this purpose, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to systematically derive, from the trajectory of a single dipping CheA dimer, a pseudo reaction coordinate by which to easily monitor the progression towards the 'dipped' conformation. A total of four 'dipping' events were observed in our unit cell simulations, as illustrated by projection of the conformations of the 27 CheA dimer time series onto the first principal component (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, top). Importantly, an additional two dipping events were observed in the 30 CheA dimers of the relatively shorter simulations of CheA<sub>2</sub>-trimer model (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), demonstrating that the ability of the conformational change to occur is not an artifact of the particular choice of CheA P4 positioning during modeling. Interestingly, the three <i>extended</i> 'dipping' events observed in the unit-cell simulations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; red, blue, and green traces) as well as the two events observed in the CheA<sub>2</sub>-trimer simulations were accompanied by the formation of the R297/E397 contact. Notably, this contact was not formed in the one <i>short</i> dipping event, which returned to the 'undipped' bulk state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; gold trace), suggesting that the R297/E397 contact may play a role in stabilizing the 'dipped' state. To further investigate the significance of the R297/E397 contact for the conformational dynamics of CheA, we launched nine additional unit cell simulations with an R297A mutation to prevent the potential formation of the R297/E397 salt bridge. Indeed, while two CheA dimers exhibited the dipping motion in these simulations, including one dimer that underwent two dips, the mutants quickly return to the bulk (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, bottom)."

Moreover, in vivo cross-linking and western blot analysis showed a high molecular weight band present only in the double cysteine mutant, suggesting the presence of species formed by cross-linking between CheA-P3 and Tsr (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We also examined cross-linking residue pairs that involve Tsr-R394 interactions with CheA, one in the 'undipped' state (CheA-E316C/Tsr-R394) and the other in the 'dipped' state (CheA-E361C/Tsr-R394). When Tsr-R394 is replaced by a cysteine or serine, either as a single mutant (cysless CheA/R394C, cysless CheA/R394S) or in the context of a double mutant (D316C/R394C, D316C/R394S, E361C/R394C, E361C/R394S), the chemotaxis function of <i>E. coli</i> is partially inhibited. On the other hand, the chemotactic ability of CheA-E361C as a single mutant (E361C/wt Tsr) is also partially inhibited, while CheA-D316C (E316C/wt Tsr) mutation bears no effect on the function (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Furthermore, the cross-linking pattern of both Tsr-R394 mutant pairs showed two high molecular weight bands corresponding to distinct cross-linked species, one with a disulfide formed between Tsr and CheA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, upper band, blue arrows) and the other with a disulfide between two Tsr molecules with the R394C mutation (lower band). Interestingly, the cross-linking of CheA-P4/Tsr (E361C/R394C) in the predicted 'dipped' conformation is much weaker than the cross-linking of CheA-P3/Tsr (D316C/R394C) in the 'undipped' state, though both involve the same R394 residue of Tsr (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). The lower cross-linking efficiency could be due to the relatively infrequent occurrence of the CheA 'dipped' conformation, and/or because the residues are further apart in a dominant conformation, suggesting that the CheA-P4 'dipped' conformation observed in silico may have been sampled within the native chemosensory complex of <i>E. coli</i>."

Indeed, substitution of the corresponding residue in <i>E. coli</i> (R265) with several amino acids of different properties (R265C/S/A/E) were all detrimental to the chemotactic function of <i>E. coli</i> as measured by the soft-agar assay, without affecting the cluster formation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since this residue is located at the N-terminus of the four-helix P3 dimerization motif, R265 could direct the P2-P3 linker away from the cis subunit and toward the trans subunit, thus anchoring CheA-P1P2 to CheA-P4\u2019 for trans-interaction and phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bilwes et al., 1999</a>). A more complete model of the core-signaling complex for <i>E. coli</i> may be necessary to fully interpret the drastic impact of this single CheA residue on the entire chemotactic machinery."

In this study, we identified, using MD simulations, a dipping motion of the CheA P4 domain, which was functionally characterized using swim assay and cross-linking experiments. While the role of the predicted conformational change in CheA is not immediately clarified in the preliminary biochemical experiments carried out here, our model highlights the importance of CheA dynamics for signaling and suggests that the dynamics of the P4 kinase domain, in particular, warrants special investigation. More importantly, the atomic model presented here, in general, provides improved knowledge of the positioning of the P3 and P4 domains, incorporates the presence of the CheW only ring, and identifies probable novel side-chain contacts within the extended chemosensory architecture. Further improving the resolution of our cryoET data to better than 8\u00a0\u00c5 using the novel lipid-monolayer system described above would allow generation of an atomic homology model of the <i>E. coli</i> chemosensory array, greatly facilitating the use of the wealth of existing biochemical and biophysical data and providing directly transferrable structural and dynamical predictions. We hope that the findings presented here will inspire further experimental and computational studies towards the elucidation of a complete mechanistic description of signal transduction and amplification within this truly impressive biological sensory apparatus."

Using the refined geometry parameters, the raw projections were centered and rotated so the tilt azimuth was coincident with the Y-axis using the IMOD 'newstack'function. These rotated stacks were corrected for the CTF with phase flipping, and volume reconstructions were made using SIRT as implemented in IMOD. These were calculated using a GPU, thereby removing an additional interpolation in the reconstruction step, by avoiding the use of cosine stretching of the input projections. Reconstructed volumes calculated from 20 SIRT iterations, providing higher contrast, were used for the initial cycles of sub-tomogram extraction and alignment, while those from 60 SIRT iterations were used for the final cycles."

In the case of the CheW ring model, the P5 domains of the CheA-P5/CheW ring model were exchanged with CheW monomers, using the dual-SH3-like fold shared between by CheA-P5 and CheW, to obtain an appropriate placement and orientation with respect to the neighboring monomers. <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a> schematically summarizes the modeling procedures described above.

Next, we made use of the CheA-P5/receptor interface from the ternary complex structure PDB 4JPB (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li and Bayas, 2013</a>) to model the CheW/receptor interface, assuming a receptor-binding mode homologous to that of CheA-P5.

Finally, CheA-P3,4 core component models were placed between adjacent TODs in accordance with the patterns observed in our density maps and joined to nearby ring-bound regulatory domains (P5) at the P4-P5 flexible linker.

The fractional variances accounted for by the top three modes were 41.8%, 31.1%, and 8.1% respectively. Subsequently, the three CheA dimers from each replica of the wild-type unit cell model (27 dimers total), R297A unit cell model (27 dimers total), and CheA<sub>2</sub>-trimer model (30 dimers total) simulations were extracted, aligned to the P5 domains, and projected on to the top principal component of the wild-type dip-exhibiting CheA dimer.

For the clustering analysis, we first extracted the three core-signaling units from each of the nine wild-type unit cell replica simulations, using 1500 frames/core-signaling unit for a total of 40,500 frames. The RMSD distance matrix was then computed using the \u2018rms_fit_trj\u2019 function from the MDAnalysis package.

All of the unit-cells are equivalently oriented relative to the electron beam and during tomography are tilted through a limited angular range. As is also the case in 2D electron-crystallography experiments, this results in a missing cone of information in the final structure. The resolution of the structure is therefore lower in Z than in X, Y. This situation cannot be avoided for a monolayer sample. This anisotropic resolution has multiple implications: it will lead to apparent smearing of the structure in Z; it will influence the ability to place the subunits into the map, and especially to determine their Z-position; it will affect the MDFF. The authors only quote a single resolution suggesting this effect may not be considered. What is the resolution in Z? Does this allow reliable positioning of the structural models in Z? How reliable is this positioning? How was the anisotropic resolution taken into account in MDFF?"

It is not clear to me how reliable these positions are. For example, the authors state that the four-helix bundle of the CheA-P3 bundle is clearly discerned to run parallel to the receptor. How clearly? Judging from the available supplementary movie, there is some room for varying this position, as there is for the position of the P5 domain, in particular in the Z direction. What is currently missing is an assessment of how reliable the subunit models are and how accurately the EM map determines their position and arrangement. Are any alternative arrangements possible? With what confidence can this arrangement be selected? How accurately can the domain positions and orientations be determined using an EM map of this resolution and these structural subunit models? How accurate do these initial positions need to be to interpret details after MDFF? One can imagine that with a 30 \u00c5 resolution structure, subsequent MDFF would not give a structure reliable to side-chain resolution, while with a 5 \u00c5 structure it would \u2013 what about at the resolution in this manuscript? In the end the authors go on to determine specific amino acid interactions and conformational changes, so it is important to clearly justify/demonstrate that this level of interpretation is reliable and unique given the input data."

This is an important issue because the EM data here alone determines the P4 position and it does not draw on crystal structures, such as most of the other interfaces. The conformation of P4 is also critical to the dynamics simulations that follow. The domain fitting was done reasonably, however; on viewing the density, one wonders if other positions are also nearly as compatible. For example, do the fits converge if different starting conformations are used? Could some metric be given with respect to the goodness of fit? Also on this point, it appears that the nucleotide-free form on the P4 domain was taken, both for the modeling and the dynamics. ATP binding substantially affects the conformation of a large loop on the P4 domain surface. Does ATP-bound P4 give a similar fit as the nucleotide-free form?"

It would be useful to know what percent of the eigenvalues are represented by the first component and how many vectors represent a majority of the total motion. Also, the authors focus on this one dipping transition; are there no other significant conformational changes? The arrays are of great interest in part due to their cooperative behavior; one might expect such simulations to reveal recoupling across core particles. There is also data that changes in the P5-receptor interfaces are associated with activation (Piasta et al. 2013). Are any such motions observed? This should be commented on."

Control sites would have to be investigated and relative rates of cross-linking determined, ideally for multiple positions. For example, the R394 self cross-link seems to form as readily as CheA-receptor cross-links. R394 self cross-links are not surprising given the symmetry in the trimers-of-dimers, nonetheless, these sites are ~15 \u00c5 apart. Furthermore, it is not clear why the N405 self cross-links also do not form, given that these residues are closer to each other than are copies of R394. The statement near the end of the second paragraph of the subsection \u201cBiochemical validation of CheA conformational change in <i>E. coli</i> cells\u201d is not accurate, given that the yields of the 394 self cross-links are quite different in the two experiments. Normalizing to this band, there is not much change between the 394/361 and 394/316 pairs. Even if the cross-linking is less for 316/394, it could mean that those resides are simply further apart in a dominant conformation or show reactivity differences (e.g. 405 vs. 394). There is also the question of what state the cells are in during cross-linking. The attractant serine is present during the experiment, but depending on the timing of the washes, the cells are likely adapted. How much of CheA is activated and how much is inhibited in these experiments? For only a few sites, as investigated here, it would be more powerful to detect an attractant depend effect on relative cross-linking of the reporters. As it stands, the cross-linking data primarily supports the general architecture, but does not make the dipping mechanism more compelling."

This should be explained in the text or figure legend. Do all the mutants form attractant rings at the migration fronts indicative of chemotaxis? Or do some just show spreading, a consequence of some CheA activation, but no regulation (pseudotaxis). Photographs of the swarm plates for key mutants (or those that show differences should be provided as figure supplements). Furthermore, simply measuring the swarm radius does not distinguish a mechanistic defect from an assembly defect. Can an assessment be made (perhaps using the reconstitution system) if the mutants form arrays like wt?"

This is not a valid argument for two reasons. Firstly because the angular coverage is not good \u2013 high tilt angles are clearly underrepresented relative to low tilt angles, and this will cause a resolution anisotropy (it is not completeness of coverage, but uniformity of coverage that determines resolution anisotropy). Secondly, at high tilt the monolayer sample is much thicker and the projections have lower signal to noise. High and low tilts do not contribute equivalently to the final structure. This will also cause resolution anisotropy. I reiterate my initial concern \u2013 that the resolution of the structure is expected to be lower in Z than in X and Y. In the response to reviewers the authors show some isosurfaces with simulated wedges. It is not possible to sensibly assess the extent of anisotropic resolution from such images, and anyway, fitting is not based on isosurfaces, but on density. I am not persuaded that resolution anisotropy can be largely disregarded as the authors suggest."

The authors have access to the raw data and do not seem to be concerned by this. In that case they need to help the reader to assess the reliability of the model. Ideally by providing a metric for the goodness of fit, but minimally by an honest appraisal of the caveats, clearly and openly discussing the reliability of the fit, where alternative positions are possible, and how this might influence the interpretation.

The one exception is the cross-linking studies. I still do not agree with the statement that \"Taken together, our cross-linking experiments suggest that the CheA-P4 \"dipped\" conformation observed in silico is indeed sampled within the native chemosensory complex of <i>E. coli</i>.\" The inference here is that the cross-linking data supports the dipped conformation as a relevant state of the arrays. It may well be, but, the cross-linking data does not provide strong support for this supposition. Again, the only band to report on the dipped conformation (361/394) is quite weak, much weaker than the self 394-394 band. It's not uncommon to see some cross-linking between residues that are in proximity. In fact, I would be surprised if no cross-linking was observed, even if only the undipped conformation was represented. The authors can lean more on their mutagenesis data to support the dipped conformation, but I don't think the cross-linking makes the case."

All of the unit-cells are equivalently oriented relative to the electron beam and during tomography are tilted through a limited angular range. As is also the case in 2D electron-crystallography experiments, this results in a missing cone of information in the final structure. The resolution of the structure is therefore lower in Z than in X, Y. This situation cannot be avoided for a monolayer sample. This anisotropic resolution has multiple implications: it will lead to apparent smearing of the structure in Z; it will influence the ability to place the subunits into the map, and especially to determine their Z-position; it will affect the MDFF. The authors only quote a single resolution suggesting this effect may not be considered. What is the resolution in Z? Does this allow reliable positioning of the structural models in Z?

Nevertheless, this resolution places tight constraints on the overall positioning and tertiary structure of the proteins involved. In addition, we would like to highlight that the proteins were not docked into the EM map in one-by-one but rather heuristically-constructed, full subunit pieces were docked to best preserve known interfaces (e.g., receptors within receptor TOD from 1QU7, CheA-P5/CheW interfaces from 4JPB, receptor/CheW and receptor/CheA-P5 from NMR, etc.). Assuming the correctness of these previously-characterized interfaces, no other global arrangements are possible.

This flexibility arises from the use of the chemically-based MD force field, which adds much additional information to help refine the model\u2019s side chain orientations and interactions during the fitting procedure. Unfortunately, there currently are no robust methods for assessing the \u201caccuracy\u201d (that is, how closely the model matches the \u201ctrue\u201d structure) of a model derived via the fitting of high-resolution structures into lower-resolution EM maps, especially those with resolution lower than 8 \u00c5.

Rather, validation of the reliability of a model may still be given in terms of its \u201cprecision\u201d, that is the qualitative reproducibility of the model\u2019s key predictions. Importantly, we subsequently carried out extensive, <i>all-atom</i> MD simulations on multiple models and using many independent simulations and demonstrated that the key discovery of this study, namely the dipping conformational dynamics of the CheA kinase domain, is reproduced in multiple simulations of both heuristically- and MDFF-derived models.

For example, one could imagine the interaction being related to a Class I model given the spatial relationship with this pair and R354/E392 examined in a recent NMR study. On the other hand, it could also be that the rearrangement of P4 is important to bring into register binding sites for P1 in support of a class II model, or some combination of the two.

We did not observe any additional stabilized dipping events in the wild-type simulations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, top). Moreover, in the R297A mutant simulations, one of the dipping CheA P4s underwent an additional dip-return event (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, bottom), further closing the gap between the sheer number of dipping events observed in the two models. Hence, in light of the new data, we agree with the reviewer that our proposal that the R297/E397 contact may help promote the dipping conformation change is not well supported. We have removed this notion from the main text. On the other hand, our suggestion that the R297/E397 contact may help stabilize the dipping conformation seems to be reinforced by our extended simulations. In particular, in the wild-type simulations, the three (of the four total) dipping CheA dimers in which the R297/E397 contact was formed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, top, red, blue, green traces) maintain this conformation, while the dimer that did not form the R297/E397 contact (yellow trace) returned to the bulk. In addition, both dipping CheA dimers in the R297A mutant simulations, which are of course unable to from the R297/E397 salt bridge, quickly return to the bulk (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, bottom, red, blue traces), including the P4 domain, which undergoes two dip-return events (blue trace). Hence, we feel the suggestion of the stabilizing nature of the R297/E397 contact is reasonable in light of the comparative in silicodata.

Firstly because the angular coverage is not good \u2013 high tilt angles are clearly underrepresented relative to low tilt angles, and this will cause a resolution anisotropy (it is not completeness of coverage, but uniformity of coverage that determines resolution anisotropy). Secondly, at high tilt the monolayer sample is much thicker and the projections have lower signal to noise. High and low tilts do not contribute equivalently to the final structure. This will also cause resolution anisotropy. I reiterate my initial concern \u2013 that the resolution of the structure is expected to be lower in Z than in X and Y. In the response to reviewers the authors show some isosurfaces with simulated wedges. It is not possible to sensibly assess the extent of anisotropic resolution from such images, and anyway, fitting is not based on isosurfaces, but on density. I am not persuaded that resolution anisotropy can be largely disregarded as the authors suggest.This is not an unusual problem and it should not be difficult for the authors to address this issue better. They should be clear in the manuscript that there is resolution anisotropy and make an attempt to measure its extent (previous publications have used for example FSC within cones or 3DSSR to assess anisotropic resolution). The potential effect of this on fitting and MDFF should then be considered. Ideally, this would be taken into account during simulation, but the authors will probably consider this too much work.

From the authors response to reviewers it sounds like the position is not well defined, but that different positions still undergo dipping motions. I am still concerned that the orientation of P4 is not well defined by the EM map, that the starting orientation is critical to the MDFF analysis, and that this influences the interpretation of the dipping motion. The authors have access to the raw data and do not seem to be concerned by this. In that case they need to help the reader to assess the reliability of the model. Ideally by providing a metric for the goodness of fit, but minimally by an honest appraisal of the caveats, clearly and openly discussing the reliability of the fit, where alternative positions are possible, and how this might influence the interpretation. This should be in the main text of the manuscript.</i>"

We fit the CheA-P4 domain via rigid-body transformations starting from 10,000 random angular orientations and up to 20\u00c5 shifts from the center of the mass, to generate a metric for the goodness of fit. This fitting resulted in 23 distinct classes (separated by 3\u00b0 and 3\u00c5), as shown in <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 5A</a>. The class of best fit (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 5B</a>, panel 1, with highest cross correlation and highest number of contributing fit) is similar to the MDFF model (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 5B</a>, Panel 10 with overlay). In addition to the best fit, one other possible fit is #5 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 5B</a>, panel 5), given the proximity of the N and C termini of P4 to the P3 and P5 domain. This fit is less probable compared to the best fit, considering that it has a lower cross-correlation value, a much lower occupancy with ~ 1/3 the number of contributing fits, and the positions of P4-N and C termini are reversed (flipped), making it hard to connect the P3 and P5 termini with short linkers. In the revised manuscript, we have included the fitting metric and a discussion on the possible alternative P4 positions that might influence the interpretation (subsection \u201cAll-atom model of the <i>T. maritima</i> chemosensory array\u201d, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

It may well be, but, the cross-linking data does not provide strong support for this supposition. Again, the only band to report on the dipped conformation (361/394) is quite weak, much weaker than the self 394-394 band. It's not uncommon to see some cross-linking between residues that are in proximity. In fact, I would be surprised if no cross-linking was observed, even if only the undipped conformation was represented. The authors can lean more on their mutagenesis data to support the dipped conformation, but I don't think the cross-linking makes the case.</i>"
