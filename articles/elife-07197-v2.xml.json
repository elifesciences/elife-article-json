To test whether exosomal RNAs also contribute to changes in gene expression in recipient cells, and whether mutant <i>KRAS</i> might regulate the composition of secreted microRNAs (miRNAs), we compared small RNAs of cells and matched exosomes from isogenic CRC cell lines differing only in <i>KRAS</i> status. We show that exosomal profiles are distinct from cellular profiles, and mutant exosomes cluster separately from wild-type <i>KRAS</i> exosomes. <i>miR-10b</i> was selectively increased in wild-type exosomes, while <i>miR-100</i> was increased in mutant exosomes. Neutral sphingomyelinase inhibition caused accumulation of <i>miR-100</i> only in mutant cells, suggesting <i>KRAS</i>-dependent miRNA export. In Transwell co-culture experiments, mutant donor cells conferred <i>miR-100</i>-mediated target repression in wild-type-recipient cells. These findings suggest that extracellular miRNAs can function in target cells and uncover a potential new mode of action for mutant <i>KRAS</i> in CRC."

To test whether exosomal RNAs also contribute to changes in gene expression in recipient cells, and whether mutant <i>KRAS</i> might regulate the composition of secreted microRNAs (miRNAs), we compared small RNAs of cells and matched exosomes from isogenic CRC cell lines differing only in <i>KRAS</i> status. We show that exosomal profiles are distinct from cellular profiles, and mutant exosomes cluster separately from wild-type <i>KRAS</i> exosomes. <i>miR-10b</i> was selectively increased in wild-type exosomes, while <i>miR-100</i> was increased in mutant exosomes. Neutral sphingomyelinase inhibition caused accumulation of <i>miR-100</i> only in mutant cells, suggesting <i>KRAS</i>-dependent miRNA export. In Transwell co-culture experiments, mutant donor cells conferred <i>miR-100</i>-mediated target repression in wild-type-recipient cells. These findings suggest that extracellular miRNAs can function in target cells and uncover a potential new mode of action for mutant <i>KRAS</i> in CRC."

One example of these non-coding RNAs is a class of small RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs), which are predicted to target more than 60% of protein-coding genes and can control which proteins are made."

Mature miRNAs are 21\u201323 nucleotides in length and bind to target mRNAs to inhibit their expression (<a href=\"#bib37\">Krol et al., 2010</a>). Because miRNAs imperfectly pair with their mRNA targets, they can potentially regulate hundreds of transcripts within a genome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bartel and Chen, 2004</a>). However, individual miRNAs exhibit exquisite tissue-specific patterns of expression (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wienholds et al., 2005</a>), control cell fate decisions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alvarez-Garcia and Miska, 2005</a>), and are often aberrantly expressed in human cancers (<a href=\"#bib59\">Thomson et al., 2006</a>), affording possible disease-specific signatures with diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic potential (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Volinia et al., 2006</a>)."

Given the potential of cancer-derived secreted RNAs to modulate the tumor microenvironment, elucidation of the potential mechanisms for selective sorting of cargo into exosomes is critical to understanding extracellular signaling by RNA. <i>KRAS</i> mutations occur in approximately 34\u201345% of colon cancers (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wong and Cunningham, 2008</a>). We have previously shown that exosomes from mutant <i>KRAS</i> colorectal cancer (CRC) cells can be transferred to wild-type cells to induce cell growth and migration (<a href=\"#bib30\">Higginbotham et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Demory Beckler et al., 2013</a>). Compared to exosomes derived from isogenically matched wild-type cells, exosomes derived from mutant <i>KRAS</i> cells contain dramatically different protein cargo (<a href=\"#bib18\">Demory Beckler et al., 2013</a>). Here, we show that <i>KRAS</i> status also prominently affects the miRNA profile in cells and their corresponding exosomes. Exosomal miRNA profiles are distinct from cellular miRNA patterns, and exosomal miRNA profiles are better predictors of <i>KRAS</i> status than cellular miRNA profiles. Furthermore, we show that cellular trafficking of miRNAs is sensitive to neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) inhibition in mutant, but not wild type, <i>KRAS</i> cells and that transfer of miRNAs between cells can functionally alter gene expression in recipient cells."

However, the small RNA read distribution from exosomes was much broader with many reads smaller than 22 nucleotides in length (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Given that these reads map to RNAs other than known miRNAs, these data suggest that a large proportion of small exosomal RNA reads is derived from processing of other RNAs, in addition to post-transcriptionally modified miRNA reads that are apparently subject to editing, trimming, and/or tailing (<a href=\"#bib35\">Koppers-Lalic et al., 2014</a>). Consistent with this, when read identity was restricted to miRNAs by mapping back to known miRNA hairpin sequences, the length distribution of mappable reads was nearly identical between cells and exosomes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

The miRNA profiles from the three cell lines all clustered close to one another indicating that overall miRNA expression profiles are fairly similar among the different cell types (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In marked contrast, PC analysis revealed that exosomal miRNA profiles clearly segregate according to <i>KRAS</i> status (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Relatively, minor differences between cellular miRNA expression profiles become much more prominent when comparing exosomal miRNA patterns (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

                                "text": "Although little is understood regarding the molecular mechanisms for packaging exosomal miRNAs, recent evidence suggests that the secretion of miRNAs in exosomes is dependent on ceramide via its production by neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase 2) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kosaka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mittelbrunn et al., 2011</a>). Inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis by treatment with a nSMase inhibitor impaired exosomal miRNA release, apparently due to decreased formation of miRNA-containing exosomes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kosaka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mittelbrunn et al., 2011</a>). To test the role of nSMase in miRNA secretion in our system, we treated CRC cells with the nSMase inhibitor, GW4869. We determined the effect of this inhibitor on <i>miR-10b</i> since it is preferentially found in wild-type <i>KRAS</i> DKs-8 exosomes, <i>miR-100</i> since it is preferentially found in mutant <i>KRAS</i> DKO-1 and DLD-1 exosomes, and <i>miR-320</i> which sorts into exosomes regardless of <i>KRAS</i> status. For <i>miR-10b</i>, we did not observe significant changes in its cellular levels after treatment with GW4869 in either wild-type <i>KRAS</i> DKs-8 or mutant <i>KRAS</i> DKO-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In contrast, inhibition of nSMase caused a \u223cthreefold increase in intracellular levels of <i>miR-100</i> in mutant <i>KRAS</i> DKO-1 cells but remained unchanged in wild-type DKs-8 <i>KRAS</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B,C</a>). Similarly, <i>miR-320</i> levels were found to increase (\u223c2.5 fold) only in GW4869-treated mutant <i>KRAS</i> DKO-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These data are most consistent with the hypothesis that impaired ceramide synthesis alters cellular accumulation of miRNAs dependent on mutant <i>KRAS</i> and suggest that multiple biogenic routes exist for miRNA secretion."

Our finding that <i>miR-10b</i> is preferentially enriched in wild-type <i>KRAS</i>-derived exosomes, while <i>miR-100</i> is enriched in mutant <i>KRAS</i>-derived exosomes raises interesting questions regarding how they are selected for secretion. <i>miR-10b</i> and <i>miR-100</i> are both part of the <i>miR-10/100</i> family and differ by only one base in the seed region, allowing regulation of distinct sets of target mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tehler et al., 2011</a>). Whether the accumulation or export of these miRNAs is a result or a consequence of oncogenic signaling remains unknown. Preventing the export or retention of certain miRNAs, such as <i>miR-100 and miR-10b,</i> may serve a therapeutic role in reversing the tumorigenic effects seen with aberrant miRNA expression."

This could reflect a mechanism by cells to selectively export miRNAs so as to maintain specific growth or gene expression states. This is consistent with a recent report that found that the cellular levels of <i>miR-218-5p</i> could be maintained, despite changes in the abundance of its target, likely through a \u2018miRNA relocation effect\u2019 where unbound miRNAs that are in excess have the potential to be sorted to exosomes (<a href=\"#bib56\">Squadrito et al., 2014</a>). Another mechanism may be through sequence-specific motifs that direct miRNA trafficking by interaction with specific chaperone proteins (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bolukbasi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</a>). Although we did not find any globally significant motif overrepresented in exosomal miRNAs, we cannot rule out that individual miRNAs might undergo sequence-specific export. <i>miR-320</i> family members all contain the GGAG motif that has been proposed to serve as an exosomal targeting signal (<a href=\"#bib62\">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</a>). We found that members of the <i>miR-320</i> family are preferentially enriched in exosomes independent of <i>KRAS</i> status; however, the GGAG sequence was not found in other miRNAs that are targeted to exosomes. It has been reported that the biogenesis of <i>miR-320</i> family members occurs by a non-canonical pathway that requires neither Drosha (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chong et al., 2010</a>) nor XPO5 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Xie et al., 2013</a>). Instead, the 5\u2032 ends contain a 7-methyl guanosine cap that facilitates nuclear\u2013cytoplasmic transport through XPO1 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Xie et al., 2013</a>). XPO1 is present in DKO-1, DKs-8, and DLD-1 exosomes as detected by mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#bib18\">Demory Beckler et al., 2013</a>). It will be interesting to investigate whether alternate processing pathways and associated biogenic machinery contribute to the heterogeneity of EV cargo and affect miRNA secretion."

In certain contexts, the addition of non-templated uridine residues to cognate miRNAs accelerates miRNA turnover (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baccarini et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wei et al., 2012</a>). Thus, it is possible that the stability/half-life of a miRNA affects whether it is retained or secreted. While the exact functional significance of 3\u2032-end modifications of miRNAs detected in both cells and exosomes remains to be determined, it could be that differential export of \u2018tagged\u2019 miRNAs could allow cells to export specific miRNAs. However, the lack of any apparent motif upon global analysis of miRNAs enriched in exosomes, coupled to the finding that even untagged miRNAs are differentially exported, suggests multiple strategies for loading of miRNAs into EVs, and that not all EVs and exosomes contain identical cargo. This further implies that different cell types secrete a heterogeneous population of vesicles. Although the biological relevance of these findings remains to be determined, the specific sorting of miRNAs into exosomes may enable cancer cells to discard tumor-suppressive miRNAs so as to increase their oncogenic potential or perhaps modulate gene expression in neighboring and distant cells to promote tumorigenesis. In support of this hypothesis, <i>miR-100</i>, which we found to be enriched in mutant <i>KRAS</i> exosomes, was found to down-regulate LGR5 in CRC cells and thereby inhibit migration and invasion of such cells (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>).

Thus, although <i>miR-100</i> can function as a tumor suppressor under normal conditions, augmenting its levels, for example, by EV uptake, could potentially promote EMT. In this regard, the role of <i>miR-100</i> in tumorigenesis would be twofold, where its secretion in exosomes could function to maintain low-intracellular levels within mutant cells, while inducing EMT in wild-type-recipient cells. Along these lines, <i>miR-100</i> is part of the <i>miR-125b/let-7a-2/miR-100</i> cluster that is transcribed and expressed coordinately (<a href=\"#bib20\">Emmrich et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, in malignant colonic tissues from individuals with CRC, <i>miR-100</i> levels were significantly decreased while <i>let-7a</i> levels were strongly upregulated (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tarasov et al., 2014</a>). Based on our finding that there is differential accumulation of individual miRNAs within this cluster between mutant <i>KRAS</i> cells and exosomes, it will be interesting to determine whether cancer cells down-regulate specific miRNAs by active secretion, while simultaneously maintaining the levels of other miRNAs transcribed within the same cluster."

In support of this, it was recently shown that in exosomes from breast cancer cells, CD43 mediates the accumulation of Dicer (<a href=\"#bib44\">Melo et al., 2014</a>). These exosomes also contain other RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) proteins and pre-miRNAs, indicating that miRNA processing can occur in exosomes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Melo et al., 2014</a>). These components were absent in exosomes derived from normal cells. It remains to be determined whether components of the RISC-loading complex assemble within endosomes before their secretion as exosomes or by the fusion of exosomes containing heterogeneous cargo after they are secreted. The observation that cells can selectively release miRNAs and also release a heterogeneous population of vesicles raises the possibility that differential release of miRNAs is associated with different classes of exosomes and microvesicles."

The results of our Transwell co-culture experiments are most consistent with extracellular transfer of specific miRNAs to alter expression of reporter constructs. Nevertheless, the level of exosomal transfer that is needed to alter recipient cell gene expression in vivo remains an open question. Our finding that mutant <i>KRAS</i> protein can be functionally transferred in exosomes indicates that the full effect of exosomes on recipient cells can be due to a combination of both RNA delivery and protein-based signaling (<a href=\"#bib30\">Higginbotham et al., 2011</a>). This could include activation of Toll-like receptors with possible downstream effects following nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells or mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fabbri et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). The complexity of <i>miR-100</i> function in the tumor microenvironment underscores this argument by its potential for inhibiting mTOR expression which is required for proliferation of <i>Apc</i>-deficient tumors in mouse models (<a href=\"#bib22\">Faller et al., 2015</a>). In tumors where some cells have incurred activating mutations in <i>KRAS</i>, while others have not, <i>miR-100</i> could accumulate in wild-type <i>KRAS</i> tumor cells through exosomal transfer, inhibiting mTOR and cell growth. Conversely, <i>miR-100</i> could be secreted from mutant <i>KRAS</i> cells giving them a growth advantage. In this way, exosomal transfer of miRNAs might act to select for cells carrying specific tumor driver mutations. Our studies have direct implications for CRC and, together with other studies, indicate that delivery of exosomes to recipient cells can induce cell migration, inflammation, immune responses, angiogenesis, invasion, pre-metastatic niche formation, and metastasis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kahlert and Kalluri, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boelens et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Melo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Costa-Silva et al., 2015</a>)."

Remaining reads were trimmed 1 bp from the 3\u2032 end and remapped to hairpin sequences. The remapping process was repeated 10 times. Finally, all mapped reads were collected for further analysis."

This is not unexpected and is central to controversies in the field as to the stoichiometry and function of secreted RNA. Indeed, we think this is the key question moving forward because experimental proof of transfer can be difficult. Many studies successfully showing RNA transfer utilized experiments where nonphysiological concentrations of purified exosomes were added to recipient cells (see manuscript references). Evidence of transfer has also been demonstrated between immune cells that can remain opposed to one another for hours facilitating exRNA transfer but making it very difficult to precisely quantify the level of transfer (Mittelbrunn et al., Nature Communications 2:282, Ekstrom et al. JEV 1:18389, Montecalvo et al. Blood 119: 756). In our experiments, we chose to use Transwell co-culture experiments to resemble a more physiological system and also to test functional miRNA transfer with reporter constructs. We observed a \u223c60-65% decrease with perfect sites and a \u223c40% decrease with a wild-type mTOR 3\u2019 UTR. Analysis of <i>miR-100</i> levels in recipient cells showed an approximate 34 % increase in <i>miR-100</i> levels compared to cells cultured in the absence of donor cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). The increase in <i>miR-100</i> levels is supported by precise copy number calculations that show that there are 329 molecules of <i>miR-100</i> per ng of total input RNA in cells grown in the absence of donor cells and those numbers increase to 443 molecules of <i>miR-100</i> in the presence of donor cells (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 2</a>)."

There are two issues. First, one has to account for the concentration of a specific miRNA and second, the concentration of all target mRNAs in specific cells and/or at specific developmental time points. The fact that there have been about 11 different published target prediction algorithms speaks to the fact that we do not yet know precisely how to identify mRNA targets, nor do we know the exact set of rules that govern pairing and repression. Seed pairing is clearly important (Lewis et al. Cell 115: 787; Brennecke et al. PLos Biol 3: e85; Grimson, Mol Cell 27: 91; Lewis et al. Cell 120: 15; Krek et al. Nat Gen 37: 495) but there are lots of examples where imperfect seed sequences are robustly silenced (Li et al. NAR 36: 4277; Didiano and Hobert, NSMB 13: 849). Identifying bona fide targets requires experimental validation; in silico prediction is just a starting point with many false positive and negatives. Thus, knowing the exact concentration of target mRNAs and extending that to determine whether a miRNA is low abundance or not is not trivial. An historical example is <i>lsy6</i> in <i>C. elegans</i> which cannot be detected in sequencing approaches because it is so low abundance in worms, yet it controls the formation of left/right asymmetry between two neurons and regulates <i>cog-1</i> through a non-canonical binding sequence (Johnston and Hobert, Nature 426: 845). The effects of <i>lsy6</i> manifest themselves as part of a downstream network that is put in play by initial miRNA regulation, nicely illustrating the point that time and place matters. Our work on the role of miRNAs during vertebrate development has also identified numerous miRNAs that are not highly abundant but whose disruption leads to specific developmental defects (Flynt et al. Nat Gen 39: 259; Li et al. Dev 138: 1817; Thatcher et al. PNAS 105: 18384). Interestingly, we often find that non-canonical targets are the key targets even though we always begin our search using seed-based algorithms. Beyond our own work, perhaps the best example arguing against abundance and functional activity is <i>miR-33</i> which is expressed at approximately 30-40 copies per liver cell compared to <i>miR-122</i> which has about 3 million copies per liver cell. Despite the numbers, modest antagonism of <i>miR-33</i> down to about 15-20 copies per cell is enough to disrupt cholesterol metabolism and rescue atherosclerosis in mice (Najafi-Shoushtari et al. Science 328: 1566, Rayner et al. Science 328: 1570, Rayner et al. JCI 121: 2921, Rayner Nature 478: 404). Another good example is <i>miR-802</i> which is not even in the top 100 miRNAs as far as abundance in liver, yet it controls glucose homeostasis and type II diabetes (Kornfeld et al. Nature 494: 111). The Mendel lab had a nice paper using overexpression of <i>miR-26</i> in transgenic mice to try to resolve why <i>miR-26</i> can act as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene in intestinal tumors. After overexpression, global analysis (GSEA) of likely mRNA targets identified numerous targets that were repressed by greater than 1.5. However, a known target of <i>miR-26</i> (EZH2) did not show up in their analysis yet they, and others, showed that <i>miR-26</i> regulates EZH2 (Zeitels et al. Genes and Dev 28: 2585). Lastly, <i>miR-206</i> was identified as one of several low abundance miRNAs that play key roles in colon cancer (Parasramka et al. Clin Epigenetics 4:16)."

This provided the necessary proof of principle to try targeting an endogenous gene which was observed using the mTOR 3\u2019 UTR. The binding sites in the mTOR 3\u2019 UTR are typical miRNA binding sites with imperfect pairing so that repression is via miRNA-based mechanisms. Even with imperfect pairing, we were still able to observe silencing albeit less than when perfect sites were used. Further, mutation of the sites derepressed silencing. Three perfect sites were used (as opposed to one perfect site) because the endogenous mTOR 3\u2019UTR also contains three <i>miR-100</i> sites. Having three perfect sites rather than one would actually underestimate the strength of Luc repression due to <i>miR-100</i> transfer."

In contrast to the statement by the reviewers, <i>miR-10b</i> is actually more abundant than <i>miR-100</i> or <i>miR-320</i> so levels do not appear to determine whether a miRNA is sphingomyelinase dependent or not. Overall, our findings are less about abundance and more about biogenesis and export of miRNA from cells. Controversy remains as to the varying roles of ESCRTs versus ceramide so it was important for us to demonstrate what we observe with our cells. As summarized in the Discussion, it seems that cell context is important and unifying conclusions are not yet possible for ceramide dependence."
