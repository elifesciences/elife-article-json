                    "text": "Human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that maintains extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis through the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion. It functions as a disulfide-tethered homodimer composed of three main domains, the Venus Flytrap module, cysteine-rich domain, and seven-helix transmembrane region. Here, we present the crystal structures of the entire extracellular domain of CaSR in the resting and active conformations. We provide direct evidence that L-amino acids are agonists of the receptor. In the active structure, L-Trp occupies the orthosteric agonist-binding site at the interdomain cleft and is primarily responsible for inducing extracellular domain closure to initiate receptor activation. Our structures reveal multiple binding sites for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions. Both ions are crucial for structural integrity of the receptor. While Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions stabilize the active state, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions reinforce the inactive conformation. The activation mechanism of CaSR involves the formation of a novel dimer interface between subunits."

                    "text": "Human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that maintains extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis through the regulation of parathyroid hormone secretion. It functions as a disulfide-tethered homodimer composed of three main domains, the Venus Flytrap module, cysteine-rich domain, and seven-helix transmembrane region. Here, we present the crystal structures of the entire extracellular domain of CaSR in the resting and active conformations. We provide direct evidence that L-amino acids are agonists of the receptor. In the active structure, L-Trp occupies the orthosteric agonist-binding site at the interdomain cleft and is primarily responsible for inducing extracellular domain closure to initiate receptor activation. Our structures reveal multiple binding sites for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions. Both ions are crucial for structural integrity of the receptor. While Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions stabilize the active state, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions reinforce the inactive conformation. The activation mechanism of CaSR involves the formation of a novel dimer interface between subunits."

Form I was crystallized in the absence and presence of 2\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and form II in the presence of 10\u2009mM L-Trp and 10\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

L-Trp facilitates extracellular domain closure of CaSR by contacting both LB1 and LB2 domains of the VFT module (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The interactions between CaSR ECD and L-Trp are primarily mediated by hydrogen bonds. (1) The carboxylic acid group of L-Trp forms hydrogen bonds through both oxygen atoms with LB1 residues S147, A168, and S170. (2) The backbone nitrogen of L-Trp is hydrogen-bonded to A168 and S170 of LB1 domain. (3) The indole nitrogen of L-Trp forms two hydrogen bonds with E297 of LB2 domain. (4) L-Trp is engaged in hydrophobic contacts with both LB1 and LB2 residues including W70, T145, Y218, and A298. The extensive contacts between backbone atoms of L-Trp and the receptor suggest that other amino acids may bind to CaSR in a similar fashion to induce domain closure."

CaSR ECD exhibited binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]-L-Trp in the absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Isotope dilution of [<sup>3</sup>H]-L-Trp with nonradioactive L-Trp led to a displacement of [<sup>3</sup>H]-L-Trp in a concentration-dependent manner. The addition of 2\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased the amount of L-Trp bound to CaSR ECD at any given concentration, suggesting that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances L-Trp binding, possibly by affecting the L-Trp-binding affinity and kinetics of CaSR. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of L-Trp (IC<sub>50</sub>, concentration at which 50% displacement of [<sup>3</sup>H]-L-Trp was observed) was approximately 2\u2009mM regardless of whether the experiment was performed in the absence (2.11 \u00b1 0.72\u2009mM) or presence (2.04 \u00b1 0.10\u2009mM) of 2\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Nevertheless, the binding affinity of L-Trp to CaSR ECD with and without Ca<sup>2+</sup> may still differ as it depends on the concentration and binding affinity of the radiolabeled ligand.

L-Trp, the amino acid used in this study, fits the role of an orthosteric agonist for CaSR. (1) It binds at the interdomain crevice of the VFT module, the canonical agonist-binding site for class C GPCRs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Geng et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kunishima et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Muto et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tsuchiya et al., 2002</a>). (2) L-Trp shares a common receptor-binding mode with the endogenous agonists of mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor, which are also amino acids or their analogs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Geng et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kunishima et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Muto et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tsuchiya et al., 2002</a>). The residues involved in agonist recognition are located at the same positions in the structures of these receptors (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For example, a conserved serine residue is responsible for securing the carboxylate of L-Trp, glutamate and GABA in CaSR (S147), mGluRs (S165) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kunishima et al., 2000</a>) and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (S130) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Geng et al., 2013</a>), respectively. (3) L-Trp interacts with both LB1 and LB2 domains to facilitate extracellular domain closure, a crucial first step during CaSR activation. In contrast, no Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is found at the putative orthosteric agonist-binding site to induce domain closure. (4) Mutations of L-Trp-binding residues completely blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced IP accumulation and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization (<a href=\"#bib63\">Silve et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Zhang et al., 2002</a>), indicating that L-Trp is required for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated receptor response. (6) L-Trp directly activates CaSR-mediated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>."

First, it maintains the structural integrity of CaSR, as manifested by the importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site 2 for receptor function. Second, it is directly involved in receptor activation. Specifically, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion at site 4 stabilizes the unique homodimer interface between membrane-proximal LB2 and CR domains in the active state. Third, Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances L-Trp binding to CaSR ECD, possibly by reinforcing the L-Trp bound and active conformation of the receptor. Furthermore, the actions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and amino acids on CaSR are inter-dependent. While the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> above a threshold level is required for amino-acid-mediated CaSR activation, amino acids increase the sensitivity of the receptor toward Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Taken together, we conclude that amino acids and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are indeed co-agonists of CaSR, acting jointly to trigger receptor activation."

It is possible that amino acids are present in cell culture media and extracellular fluid at sufficient concentration to prime the receptor to respond to increasing concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We have obtained crystals of CaSR ECD in the absence of any additional amino acids. Nevertheless, the structure showed a stretch of continuous density in the interdomain cleft that may belong to an endogenous ligand (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Table 1\u2014source data 2</a>). Despite multiple attempts, we have not been able to identify the structure of this endogenous ligand through mass spectrometry. In light of the L-Trp-bound CaSR ECD structure, we reason that the endogenous ligand may be an amino acid or even a mixture of amino acids. In the inactive structure, the endogenous ligand was likely removed by citrate buffer (pH 5.5) during enzymatic deglycosylation."

First, the anion at site 2 is required for structural stability of the receptor. Second, the anions at sites 1 and 3 appear to stabilize the inactive conformation. Binding of anions at these sites prevent favorable interactions across the interdomain cleft that promote VFT closure. Third, the presence of anion decreases CaSR-mediated IP accumulation. Therefore, these anions may exert a negative modulatory effect on CaSR activity."

This would drive CaSR toward its active-state conformation. Our hypothesis would predict that polycations with higher number of positive charges will be more effective agonists.

First, agonist causes VFT closure in all three receptor systems of CaSR, mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor. Second, receptor activation requires the association of membrane-proximal domains. For CaSR, this involves the formation of a novel homodimer interface between the LB2 and CR domains. For GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor, which lacks the CR region, agonist leads to the formation of a large heterodimer interface between the LB2 domains (<a href=\"#bib18\">Geng et al., 2013</a>). Similarly for mGluRs, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies indicate that the LB2 domains of mGluRs come into proximity to stabilize the active state (<a href=\"#bib69\">Vafabakhsh et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, disulfide crosslinking experiments of mGluR demonstrate that a precise association between the CR domains is sufficient for full receptor activation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2011</a>). Third, agonist binding is accompanied by a decrease in separation between the C-terminal ends of extracellular domains. This will likely result in rearrangement of the transmembrane domain dimer for receptor activation. Indeed, FRET and crosslinking studies have detected movement between interacting transmembrane domains of mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor upon activation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Matsushita et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Tateyama et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Xue et al., 2015</a>). In conclusion, agonist-induced VFT closure that leads to the specific association of membrane-proximal domains is a common mechanism shared by all class C GPCRs during ligand-dependent receptor activation."

A two-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) axis was identified from the self-rotation function. Polyalanine models generated from the individual LB1 and LB2 domains of mGluR3 ECD structure (<a href=\"#bib42\">Muto et al., 2007</a>) (PDB code: 2E4U) were used as search probes to locate the VFT modules of both CaSR ECD molecules in the crystal. After phase improvement by two-fold NCS-averaging, additional density appeared for the CR domain of CaSR ECD. A complete model of the CaSR ECD homodimer was developed through a succession of manual fittings and iterative refinement. The final model contained the CaSR ECD residues 20\u2013119, 135\u2013359 and 393\u2013598 in one protomer, and residues 22\u2013122, 136\u2013360 and 392\u2013602 in the other protomer. Each protomer contained eight intrasubunit disulfide bridges. Electron density was visible for carbohydrate residues (N-acetyl-glucosamine) attached to Asn90, Asn287, Asn488, Asn541 of one protomer, and Asn541 of its dimer partner. Finally, each protomer was also bound to one L-Trp ligand, four Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, and two PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions were identified by anomalous difference Fourier maps calculated using data collected at a wavelength of 1.7712\u2009\u00c5. We modeled PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> as the anions in the CaSR ECD structure because they were major components of the crystallization solution. The anomalous scattering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 1.75\u2009\u00c5 has been used successfully to identify the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites in a voltage-gated calcium channel (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tang et al., 2014</a>).

The final model for a single protomer contained CaSR ECD residues 21\u2013130 and 136\u2013603. In addition to the eight intrasubunit disulfide linkages within each protomer, the inter-subunit disulfide bond formed by C129 was ordered in the form I CaSR ECD crystal structure.

This assay quantifies the accumulation of inositol 1-monophosphate (IP<sub>1</sub>), a degradation product of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) that is stable in the presence of LiCl. Briefly, HEK293\u2009T/17 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant full-length CaSR plasmids.

The IP1 produced by cells upon activation of CaSR competes with IP1 coupled to the dye d2 for binding to the anti-IP1 antibody.

The fluorescence data was acquired at 620 and 665 nm using an EnVision plate reader (Perkin Elmer, USA) after laser excitation at 320 nm. The FRET signal was calculated as the fluorescence ratio (665 nm/620 nm). Basal activity was determined in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation.

Increasing concentrations of non-radioactive L-Trp were added to compete for receptor binding in the presence of 0\u2009mM or 2\u2009mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Each reaction was also performed in the presence of 60\u2009mM non-radioactive L-Trp for background correction. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 1\u00a0hr\u00a0to reach equilibrium. The plates were then counted in a Microbeta counter (PerkinElmer, USA). Data were analyzed using the non-linear regression algorithms in Prism (GraphPad)."

Based on the structural information available for the same receptor family (class C GPCRs), the authors propose that these two conformations represent inactive and active states of the receptor. They provide a detailed comparison of both structures to highlight the rearrangement of the ECDs that is necessary for receptor activation. Of note, this is the first structure in the class C family in which the cystein rich domain (CRD) adopt such a conformation in an agonist bound condition. This structure nicely fits the crosslinking data obtained for the metabotropic glutamate receptors in living cells and thus validate the ECD activation model of class C GPCR possessing a CRD domain: an interdomain movement triggered by VFT closure which positions the CRDs in close proximity."

The binding site for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a main agonist, was different from the canonical ligand binding sites identified in other class C GPCRs, such as mGluR and GABABR. It is noteworthy that this canonical site in CaSR was occupied by L-tryptophan, a putative co-agonist. These features concerning about binding sites and the proposed activation mechanism of CaSR is unique, in comparison to other class C GPCRs. Therefore, this paper will contribute to facilitate the understanding of physiological and biophysical properties of CaSR and class C GPCR. The authors also identified the putative binding sites for PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, and suggested that PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> is an antagonist of CaSR for the first time."

How the function results provided in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> is a mutation G55E that results in a significantly increase of EC50 for IP accumulation and intracellular calcium response. Why have such big alteration of activity for a replacement of another carbonyl oxygen? Since calcium interaction is largely electrostatic, it would make sense to test the mutational effect D234A. The provided mutational studies of I181 m, T100I, and N102I all have significantly reduced maximal amplitudes in both IP and intracellular calcium activities in addition to increased EC50. These results suggest that the surface expression of the mutated protein variants are largely reduced. Thus, the effect for these residues in calcium binding cannot be unambiguously revealed.

Given our structural observation that Ca<sup>2+</sup> stabilizes the active conformation of the receptor, we agree that Ca<sup>2+</sup> would most likely enhance the binding affinity of L-Trp since the interaction of L-Trp with an active receptor is expected to be more extensive than with an inactive receptor. In an active receptor, L-Trp would contact both the LB1 and LB2 domains. L-Trp may still bind to the open cleft in an inactive receptor, but its interaction with the receptor will be limited to the LB1 domain, which would result in lower affinity.
