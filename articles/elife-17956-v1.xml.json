In <i>Primula</i> (primroses), heterostyly is controlled by the <i>S</i>-locus supergene that determines the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between the two morphs. However, the identities of the component genes remain unknown. Here, we identify the <i>Primula CYP734A50</i> gene, encoding a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, as the <i>G</i> locus that determines the style-length dimorphism. <i>CYP734A50</i> is only present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, it is specifically expressed in S-morph styles, and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. The gene arose by a duplication specific to the Primulaceae lineage and shows an accelerated rate of molecular evolution. Thus, our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the <i>Primula</i> style-length dimorphism and begin to shed light on the evolution of the <i>S</i>-locus as a prime model for a complex plant supergene."

In <i>Primula</i> (primroses), heterostyly is controlled by the <i>S</i>-locus supergene that determines the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between the two morphs. However, the identities of the component genes remain unknown. Here, we identify the <i>Primula CYP734A50</i> gene, encoding a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, as the <i>G</i> locus that determines the style-length dimorphism. <i>CYP734A50</i> is only present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, it is specifically expressed in S-morph styles, and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. The gene arose by a duplication specific to the Primulaceae lineage and shows an accelerated rate of molecular evolution. Thus, our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the <i>Primula</i> style-length dimorphism and begin to shed light on the evolution of the <i>S</i>-locus as a prime model for a complex plant supergene."

Primrose pollen is carried by insects and the different lengths of the styles and stamens make it more likely that pollen from a pin flower will land on the stigma of a thrum flower instead of a pin flower (and vice versa)."

The gene is only present in the plants that have thrum flowers across a wide range of primrose species and genetic mutations that inactivate the gene in these plants result in flowers with longer styles. <i>CYP734A50</i> encodes an enzyme that breaks down plant hormones called brassinosteroids, which normally promote growth. Treating thrum flowers with brassinosteroids increased the length of the styles. Future challenges are to identify the other genes that are responsible for producing pin and thrum flowers and to understand how this group of genes evolved."

Individuals of heterostylous species belong to two or three morphs with reciprocal reproductive-organ arrangement and intra-morph incompatibility (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barrett, 2002</a>). Since Darwin\u2019s seminal book on <i>The different forms of flowers on plants of the same species</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Darwin, 1877</a>), <i>Primula</i> (primroses) has been the prime model for studying heterostyly (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barrett, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gilmartin, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Weller, 2009</a>). Heterostyly in <i>Primula</i> is controlled by the <i>S</i>-locus supergene that likely comprises five tightly linked genes, determining style length (the so-called <i>G</i> locus), anther height, pollen size and male and female intra-morph\u00a0incompatibility (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ernst, 1936</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lewis and Jones, 1992</a>). The S-morph haplotype carries dominant alleles at all loci, resulting in short styles due to reduced cell elongation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Webster and Gilmartin, 2006</a>) and anthers at the mouth of the flower; the L-morph haplotype carries the recessive alleles, causing long styles and low anthers. S-morphs are heterozygous for the two haplotypes, and L-morphs homozygous recessive; the absence of homozygotes for the S-morph haplotype likely results from a recessive lethal mutation on this haplotype (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kurian and Richards, 1997</a>). Efficient fertilization is only possible in inter-morph crosses. A candidate for a causal distyly gene has been described from <i>Fagopyrum</i> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yasui et al., 2012</a>); also, <i>S-</i>locus linked sequences have been identified from <i>Primula</i> and <i>Turnera</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Labonne and Shore, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Labonne et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nowak et al., 2015</a>). However, in <i>Primula</i> no causal distyly gene has been isolated, and no plausible mechanistic explanation for style length dimorphism is available in any species, hampering progress in understanding the evolution of the <i>S</i>-locus supergene."

Candidates for the <i>G</i> locus were selected based on stronger expression in S-morph styles than S-morph corollas and both organs in L-morphs; this identified 11 genes, seven of which were almost exclusively expressed in S-morphs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). We focussed on transcript DN148700_c0_g1, encoding CYP734A50 as a member of the cytochrome P450 CYP734A-family that degrade brassinosteroids (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ohnishi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Thornton et al., 2011</a>), a class of plant hormones promoting cell elongation. No reads mapping to <i>CYP734A50</i> were detected in L-morph samples (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). RT-PCR confirmed specific expression in styles of S-morphs of <i>P. veris</i> and the closely related <i>P. vulgaris</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Genotyping <i>P. veris</i> and <i>P. vulgaris</i> individuals indicated that the gene was present in each of 154 <i>P. veris</i> S-morphs from a natural population exhibiting very short linkage disequilibrium close to the <i>S</i>-locus (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nowak et al., 2015</a>), while none of the five exons could be amplified in any of 151\u2009L-morph plants; the same was seen in 41\u2009S- and 40\u2009L-morph plants of <i>P. vulgaris</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A public genome-sequencing dataset of <i>P. vulgaris</i> contained essentially no reads mapping to <i>CYP734A50</i> from L-morph samples; in S-morph samples, the read coverage of <i>CYP734A50</i> exons was only half as deep as for a related <i>CYP</i> gene (see below) (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Together, these observations indicate that the hemizygous <i>CYP734A50</i> locus is only present on the S-morph haplotype in strict linkage to the dominant <i>G</i> allele."

Thus, the same causal genes should co-segregate with morph phenotypes in all heterostylous <i>Primula</i> species. To test this for <i>CYP734A50</i>, we sequenced style transcriptomes of the distantly related <i>P. forbesii</i> S- and L-morphs (divergence time <i>P. veris</i> \u2013 <i>P. forbesii</i> ~20\u201325 Mya [<a href=\"#bib11\">de Vos et al., 2014</a>]).

Thus, the presence/absence polymorphism of <i>CYP734A50</i> has been maintained as a trans-specific polymorphism in strict linkage with the <i>G</i> locus over more than 20 million years of evolution, indicating that it is under strong balancing selection, as predicted for a causal heterostyly locus (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mast and Conti, 2006</a>)."

Classic models predict that long homostyles originate via recombination in the <i>S</i> locus affecting both the <i>G</i> and the linked female-compatibility locus, hence they are self-compatible (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barrett, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lewis and Jones, 1992</a>); by contrast, in self-incompatible long homostyles only the <i>G</i> locus should be affected by mutation or recombination (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, in <i>Primula</i> sect. <i>Aleuritia</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mast et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Richards, 2003</a>), <i>CYP734A50</i> was present in all tested S-, but none of the L-morphs of the heterostylous <i>P. frondosa (n\u00a0</i>=\u00a05 each) and <i>P. farinosa (n\u00a0</i>=\u00a05 each), and in none of the long-homostylous <i>P. scotica (n\u00a0</i>=\u00a08) and <i>P. halleri (n\u00a0</i>=\u00a09) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure\u00a02\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Similarly in <i>Primula</i> sect. <i>Primula, CYP734A50</i> was present in all S-, but none of the L-morphs of the heterostylous <i>P. elatior (n\u00a0</i>=\u00a015 each) and <i>P. juliae (n\u00a0</i>=\u00a02 each), nor in the homostylous <i>P. grandis (n\u00a0</i>=\u00a011) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure\u00a02\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Our <i>P. forbesii</i> population included self-compatible long homostyles; as expected, none of these (<i>n\u00a0</i>=\u00a06) contained the <i>CYP734A50</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Natural <i>P. vulgaris</i> populations including long-homostyles occur in two regions in southern England (<a href=\"#bib8\">Crosby, 1940</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">1949</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Unexpectedly, the <i>CYP734A50</i> locus was present in all tested long homostyles and in the S-morphs, but in none of the L-morphs from both regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). However, quantitative RT-PCR on RNA from styles of the three morphs indicated strongly reduced <i>CYP734A50</i> expression in the long homostyles compared to S-morphs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This suggests that a promoter mutation or epigenetic silencing of <i>CYP734A50</i> is responsible for the long-style phenotype, providing an alternative route to the formation of self-compatible long homostyles in nature (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We newly identified long-homostylous, yet apparently self-incompatible mutants from commercially grown <i>P. vulgaris</i> and <i>P. x pruhoniciana</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Exon 4 of <i>CYP734A50</i> was deleted in both, and no full-length transcript could be detected in the <i>P. vulgaris</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Lastly, we used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to downregulate <i>CYP734A50</i> expression in <i>P. forbesii</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Two treated S-morph individuals showed reduced <i>CYP734A50</i> expression and formed longer styles than mock-treated or virus-treated S-morphs with unaffected <i>CYP734A50</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). When the <i>P. veris</i> gene was overexpressed in tobacco, leaf and stem growth were not reduced as seen for other <i>CYP734A</i> family members (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ohnishi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Thornton et al., 2011</a>), likely reflecting the considerable sequence divergence of the <i>P. veris</i> CYP734A50 protein (see below); this mirrors the failure of certain mouse <i>SRY</i> alleles to induce correct male development in a different genetic background (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albrecht et al., 2003</a>). Thus, the <i>CYP734A50</i> presence/absence polymorphism strictly cosegregates with the morph type in all heterostylous species sampled across the <i>Primula</i> phylogeny, and the gene is absent or inactivated in all seven cases of derived long homostyly. Together with the VIGS results, this strongly supports the conclusion that <i>CYP734A50</i> is the <i>G</i> locus of the <i>Primula</i> heterostyly supergene that determines the style-length polymorphism."

A molecular phylogeny of angiosperm CYP734A proteins found in sequenced genomes indicated that <i>CYP734A50</i> arose via a gene duplication specific to the <i>Primula</i> lineage (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Like the male sex-determining gene <i>SRY</i> in mammals (<a href=\"#bib35\">O'Neill and O'Neill, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tucker and Lundrigan, 1995</a>), a causal heterostyly gene present on only one of the two homologous chromosomes in a non-recombining region should be subject to two opposing effects. The effective population size for such a gene is approximately one fourth that of unlinked diploid genes, resulting in reduced efficacy of selection and stronger drift, including the accumulation of repetitive elements (<a href=\"#bib46\">Uyenoyama, 2005</a>); at the same time, purifying selection should maintain the function of the gene. Indeed, the four introns of <i>P. veris CYP734A50</i> were exceptionally long and contained multiple transposon-derived repetitive sequences (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Comparing <i>P. veris</i> and <i>P. forbesii CYP734A50</i> gave a Ka/Ks ratio of 0.56, considerably higher than that of <i>CYP734A51</i> at 0.31. This difference was entirely due to a higher rate of non-synonymous substitutions for <i>CYP734A50</i> (p&lt;0.01), while the rate of synonymous substitutions was indistinguishable (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Similarly, Tajima\u2019s relative rate test indicated that CYP734A50 had accumulated significantly more amino-acid exchanges than CYP734A51 since their duplication (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We used branch-site tests 1 and 2 developed by <a href=\"#bib51\">Zhang et al., 2005</a> on the subtree shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> to determine whether this was likely due to relaxed constraints or to positive selection on <i>CYP734A50</i> genes. No evidence for positive selection was found for the <i>CYP734A50</i> branches or the branch separating the two <i>CYP734A50</i> genes from their <i>CYP734A51</i> paralogues based on likelihood ratio test 2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>). By contrast, relaxed constraints were supported for the <i>PfoCYP734A50</i> branch by test 1 (orange branch in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). While rigorously ruling out positive selection would likely require sequences of the paralogues from more <i>Primula</i> species, based on the above results we favour the explanation that the faster rate of molecular evolution of CYP734A50 proteins is due to a reduced efficacy of purifying selection as predicted by theory."

Evolutionarily, <i>CYP734A50</i> arose via a lineage-specific gene duplication and presumably gain of style-specific expression. Two main models have been proposed to explain the evolutionary origin of distyly. While they differ in the sequence of events, assuming either that morphological features evolved first (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lloyd and Webb, 1992</a>) or that intra-morph incompatibility arose first (<a href=\"#bib7\">Charlesworth and Charlesworth, 1979</a>), they both postulate that the first morphological change was the reduction of style length by a dominant mutation. The proposed duplication and gain of style-specific expression of <i>CYP734A50</i> in the ancestor of the Primulaceae likely represents this dominant style-shortening mutation. As such, <i>CYP734A50</i> is a rare example of an identified causal locus in a supergene underlying an adaptive polymorphism (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schwander et al., 2014</a>) that opens the way for understanding the evolutionary origin of the <i>Primula S</i>-locus as an iconic case of a complex supergene."

The number of replicates performed is indicated in the respective figure legends. No data points were excluded. Trait values in the BL treatment and VIGS experiment departed from normality in some groups, based on a Shapiro-Wilk-test; also, variance were unequal between some of the groups. Student's <i>t</i>-test is robust to deviations from normality when sample sizes are large (n\u00a0&gt;\u00a025) and comparable between the groups, both of which is the case here, and when using a two-sided test (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sawilowsky and Blair, 1992</a>); also a correction for unequal variances is available. We therefore compared style lengths and anther heights of BL-treated to mock-treated groups using a two-sided t-test assuming unequal variances. Similarly, we compared style lengths and anther heights of VIGS-treated S-morph plants with mock-treated S-morph plants, and untreated S-morph plants with mock-treated S-morph plants using a two-sided t-test assuming unequal variances. The Bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple testing."

Basically, they were looking for presence-absence signs of gene expression in tissue-specific RNAseq experiments.

Subsequently, they could show that the presence-absence of the pertinent <i>CYP734A50</i> gene holds up in S- and L-morphs across several primula species as well as mutant lines, and follow up physiological assays support a direct role of <i>CYP734A50</i> in the phenotype. Thus, despite the absence of a classic genetic linkage analysis, the identity of <i>CYP734A50</i> as the causal locus has solid support from cross-species/variety mapping.

This phenomenon, termed distyly, has only evolved once in this genus, although it has also evolved independently in other taxa. The authors used differential expression to identify a candidate gene, <i>CYP734A50</i>, that is only expressed in S-morphs. This cytochrome P450 is involved in degrading brassinosteroids, a class of hormones often associated with cell elongation. The authors further demonstrate that 1) style-specific expression of the gene is associated with the S-morph phenotype of multiple <i>Primula</i> species, 2) the presence/absence of the locus specifically segregrates with the S-morph phenotype in multiple species, 3) suppression of activity lengthens styles, 4) presence of activity results in lower brassinosteroid concentrations, 5) application of excess brassinosteroids can rescue the short style phenotype, and 6) presence/absence of the locus correlates with cell length. The data are clearly presented and discussed. I think that this is a really lovely paper that addresses a classic question in plant genetics and pollination biology. I have no suggestions for major revisions."

The gene, <i>CYP734A50</i>, degrades brassinosteroids, which promote cell elongation. Absence of this gene leads to short short-styled individuals; indeed, the gene was found only in short-styled individuals of several species of the genus <i>Primula</i>, and estimates of transcript read coverage were consistent with the gene being hemizygous in short-styled individuals. Also consistent with the inference that <i>CYP734A50</i> is indeed the gene responsible for style length in <i>Primula</i> is the fact that it was absent not only in typical long-styled individuals, but also in long homostyled individuals of <i>P. forbesii</i> or <i>P. grandis</i> (though interestingly not in those of <i>P. vulgaris</i>, suggesting that homostyly in the latter may have evolved via a different route). Virus-induced gene silencing of <i>CYP734A50</i> showed reduced expression of the gene in short-styled plants, and the development of longer styles. Moreover, the brassinosteroid castasterone, which is degraded by <i>CYP734A50</i>, was present in L-morph but not S-morph styles. I am not qualified to comment on many of the methodological details behind these aspects of the study, but the case made by the authors seems convincing on the whole, and I found the study exciting. It is also very well written."
