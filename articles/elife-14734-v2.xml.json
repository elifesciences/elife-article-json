However, in the clinic, <i>TP53</i> mutation status does not accurately predict cancer progression. Here we report, based on clinical analysis corroborated with experimental data, that the p53 isoform \u0394133p53\u03b2 promotes cancer cell invasion, regardless of <i>TP53</i> mutation status. \u0394133p53\u03b2 increases risk of cancer recurrence and death in breast cancer patients. Furthermore \u0394133p53\u03b2 is critical to define invasiveness in a panel of breast and colon cell lines, expressing WT or mutant <i>TP53</i>. Endogenous mutant \u0394133p53\u03b2 depletion prevents invasiveness without affecting mutant full-length p53 protein expression. Mechanistically WT and mutant \u0394133p53\u03b2 induces EMT. Our findings provide explanations to 2 long-lasting and important clinical conundrums: how WT <i>TP53</i> can promote cancer cell invasion and reciprocally why mutant <i>TP53</i> gene does not systematically induce cancer progression."

However, in the clinic, <i>TP53</i> mutation status does not accurately predict cancer progression. Here we report, based on clinical analysis corroborated with experimental data, that the p53 isoform \u0394133p53\u03b2 promotes cancer cell invasion, regardless of <i>TP53</i> mutation status. \u0394133p53\u03b2 increases risk of cancer recurrence and death in breast cancer patients. Furthermore \u0394133p53\u03b2 is critical to define invasiveness in a panel of breast and colon cell lines, expressing WT or mutant <i>TP53</i>. Endogenous mutant \u0394133p53\u03b2 depletion prevents invasiveness without affecting mutant full-length p53 protein expression. Mechanistically WT and mutant \u0394133p53\u03b2 induces EMT. Our findings provide explanations to 2 long-lasting and important clinical conundrums: how WT <i>TP53</i> can promote cancer cell invasion and reciprocally why mutant <i>TP53</i> gene does not systematically induce cancer progression."

Recent whole cancer genome sequencing studies have conclusively established that the tumor suppressor gene, <i>TP53,</i> is the most frequently mutated gene in a wide range of cancer types. In tumors expressing wild-type (WT) <i>TP53</i> gene, numerous experimental and clinical data have shown that viruses or cellular oncogene proteins target the p53 pathway, promoting abnormal cell proliferation. Altogether these data strongly suggest that defects in <i>TP53</i> tumor suppressor activity are a compulsory step to cancer formation. In addition, ample data have also demonstrated that <i>TP53</i> gene, whether WT or mutant, has a paramount biological and clinical role in response to cancer treatment (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brosh and Rotter, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Do et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jackson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Muller et al., 2009</a>)."

The difference between MCF7 cells and the two MDA-MB-231 cell lines may result from their <i>TP53</i> status, since mutant TAp53\u03b1 protein can activate cell migration, invasion and metastasis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gadea et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Muller et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Roger et al., 2010</a>). However, the difference in invasion between the two MDA-MB-231 cell types expressing the same mutant <i>TP53</i> gene suggests the presence of another mechanism activated in the D3H2LN variant cell line.

By quantitative real-time-PCR (RT-qPCR) using primers and probe (TaqMan) specific of the different subclasses of <i>TP53</i> mRNA variants TAp53, \u0394133 and alpha, beta and gamma (intron-9 splice variants) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Khoury et al., 2013</a>), we found that whereas the two cell lines expressed similar levels of TAp53 and alpha <i>TP53</i> mRNA variants, the more invasive MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN expressed higher levels of \u0394133p53, beta and gamma mRNA variants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We confirmed, by western blotting, the highest expression level of p53 protein isoforms in MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells by using a sheep polyclonal anti-p53 antibody (Sapu), which recognizes each p53 protein isoform with high specificity (<a href=\"#bib30\">Marcel et al., 2013</a>).

In agreement with the RT-qPCR data, TAp53\u03b1 protein expression is similar between MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN, while all the other p53 protein isoforms, notably \u2206133p53\u03b2 are expressed at higher levels in MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN. This suggests that the enhanced invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN is not due to variation of mutant TAp53\u03b1 protein expression level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, all lanes compare b to a)."

We assessed knockdown efficacy by RT-qPCR and western blotting using the Sapu and KJC8 antibodies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Importantly, depletion of \u0394133 or \u03b2 p53 variants (by transfection of si133-1, si133-2 or si\u03b2) significantly decreased the invasiveness of mutant <i>TP53</i> MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells without altering the expression of mutant TAp53\u03b1 protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). However, depletion of all p53 isoforms except \u0394133p53 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) by siTA did not change the invasive activity of MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells, indicating that the simultaneous depletion of all TAp53 (including mutant TAp53\u03b1) did not impair MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cell invasion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figures supplement 1A</a>). To confirm the role of the \u0394133p53\u03b2 isoform in promoting invasion potential, we re-introduced a si-resistant \u0394133p53\u03b2-R280K isoform in MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells in which all \u0394133p53 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) isoforms had been knocked down with si133-1 or si133-2. As expected, expression of the si133-1- and si133-2- resistant \u0394133p53\u03b2-R280K rescued invasion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Similarly, \u0394133p53\u03b2-R280K expression rescued invasion when cells were depleted of all \u03b2 isoforms by si\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We then compared the\u00a0effects of \u0394133p53\u03b1-R280K, \u0394133p53\u03b2-R280K and \u0394133p53\u03b3-R280K isoforms on cell invasion. As the siRNAs si133-1 and si133-2 specifically target the 5\u2019UTR of all \u0394133 mRNAs, we tested their respective contribution to the invasive phenotype by re-introducing each of them in MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells in which all \u0394133p53 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) isoforms had been knocked down with si133-1 or si133-2. All three mutant \u0394133p53 isoforms rescued invasion in cells depleted of \u2206133p53 variants, with \u0394133p53\u03b2-R280K conferring the highest invasive activity compared to \u0394133p53\u03b1-R280K or \u0394133p53\u03b3-R280K (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These results indicate that mutant \u0394133p53 isoforms, notably the \u0394133p53\u03b2 variant, are sufficient to promote invasion in mutant <i>TP53</i> MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells, consistently with an active role for \u0394133p53\u03b2 isoform in cancer progression."

Interestingly, depletion of mutant \u0394133 or \u03b2 p53 isoforms reversed mesenchymal traits of MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells, by inducing a significant induction of E-Cadherin protein expression and a marked decrease in Vimentin expression, particularly in cells transfected with si\u03b2.

The cell lines used were derived from the\u00a0primary colorectal carcinoma (CRC): HCT116 (WT <i>TP53</i>) and SW480 (mutant p53R273H), and from metastatic tumors: LoVo (WT <i>TP53</i>), SW620 (mutant p53R273H) and CoLo205 (mutant p53, Y103 del27bp). Of note, the SW620 cell line was derived from a metastasis of the primary tumor from which the SW480 cell line was derived one year earlier. Compared to cells derived from primary colon tumors, metastasis-derived cell lines expressing WT or mutant <i>TP53</i> exhibited a higher ability to invade Matrigel (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and had no E-Cadherin at cell-cell junctions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Of note, although the SW620 and SW480 cell lines have a mutated <i>TP53</i> gene (R273H) and come from the same patient, only SW620 are highly invasive, indicating that the\u00a0expression of mutant TAp53\u03b1-R273H protein is not sufficient to explain invasive activities. We thus measured \u0394133p53 mRNA expression by RT-qPCR (Taqman) and found it significantly higher in the invasive cell lines whether they express WT or mutant <i>TP53</i> gene, i.e. LoVo, SW620 and CoLo205, as compared with HCT116 and SW480 cell lines (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), in agreement with the results obtained in the breast cancer cell lines. To confirm the role of \u0394133p53 isoforms in cell invasion, we knocked-down these isoforms in mutant <i>TP53</i> SW620, or WT <i>TP53</i> LoVo CRC cells by using si133-1 and si133-2, which led to a significant decrease invasive capacity in both cell lines (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figures supplement 1A and B</a>). As expected, re-introduction of si133-1-resistant WT \u0394133p53\u03b2 rescued invasiveness of LoVo cells depleted of \u0394133p53 isoforms by si133-1 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figures supplement 1C and D</a>). This indicates that \u0394133p53 isoforms, notably \u0394133p53\u03b2, regulate invasion, irrespectively of <i>TP53</i> mutation status."

We observed two populations of cells, cohesive epithelial cells adherent to the glass and rounded cells loosely attached on top of cohesive cells. GFP-tagged \u0394133p53\u03b2 expression elicited a significant increase of rounded cells with dynamic bleb-like structures on their surface (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> as control). While recording, we noticed that some GFP-\u0394133p53\u03b2 -positive cohesive adherent cells detached progressively from the substratum, became rounded (white arrowhead, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and migrated (white arrow, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis showed that blebbing cells were alive and were not undergoing apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The number of blebbing cells was 25 times greater than the number of adherent cells in HCT116 cells transfected with \u0394133p53\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Similar rounded and detached cells were obtained using myc-tagged isoforms, ruling out any role of GFP in the observed phenotype (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Since loss of adhesive structures and concomitant acquisition of a rounded-blebbing movement are hallmarks of epithelial-amoeboid transition (EAT), a derivative of EMT which produce highly invasive cells, we further confirmed the EAT-like phenotype of \u0394133p53\u03b2-expressing cells by measuring E-cadherin and \u03b21-integrin levels, as the loss of both is a marker of EAT (<a href=\"#bib15\">Friedl and Wolf, 2003</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,E</a>-cadherin and \u03b21-integrin, expressed at high levels in adherent cohesive cells, were barely detected in blebbing cells, implying they had experienced EAT. \u0394133p53\u03b2 also enhanced cell migration and invasion, since its expression in HCT116 cells elicited a two-fold increase in migration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) in uncoated transwell chambers and conferred a 5 times higher invasive capacity in Matrigel (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) compared to GFP-only-transfected controls."

We therefore next investigated whether we could modify EMT/EAT features in WT <i>TP53</i> CRC cells that endogenously express high levels of \u0394133p53\u03b2. The WT <i>TP53</i> colon carcinoma LoVo cells are strongly invasive and endogenously highly express \u0394133p53 isoforms at the mRNA and protein levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a>). Knockdown of \u0394133p53 isoforms in LoVo cells remarkably decreased 3-D cell scattering, a process which shares cellular features reminiscent of cells undergoing <i>EMT/EAT</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). To investigate the impact of p53 isoforms-mediated cell scattering on the process of migration, we performed wound-healing assay. LoVo transduced with control shNS progressively detached and migrated as individual cells (arrows, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). LoVo depleted of \u0394133p53 isoforms still remain cohesive and migrate very slowly into the gap. In this case, some rare clusters of cells leave the cohesive epithelium to enter into the gap (arrowheads, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Interestingly, the cluster of cells remains compact and cells move collectively, but with a reduced velocity compared to individual migrating cells with unaffected \u2206133p53 expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">3</a>).

Consistently, <i>TP53</i> mutation is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers and its mutation status is associated with poor clinical outcome. Any cancer treatments change cell homeostasis and therefore trigger <i>TP53</i>-mediated cell responses. It is currently impossible to accurately predict response to cancer treatment in the clinic because of the large variety of <i>TP53</i>-mediated cell responses.

First, we observed that the invasive activity of MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells is positively correlated to the \u0394133p53 mRNA expression level. This was also observed in a panel of WT or mutant <i>TP53</i> colon cancer cell lines. In mutant <i>TP53</i> MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN breast cancer cells, depletion of endogenous mutant \u0394133p53 isoforms reduces cell invasion, despite unaltered and strong expression of mutant full-length p53 (TAp53\u03b1) protein. Re-introduction of si-133-resistant mutant \u0394133p53\u03b1-R280K, \u0394133p53\u03b2-R280K or \u0394133p53\u03b3-R280K in MDA-MB-231D3H2LN cells depleted of \u0394133p53 isoforms restores their invasive phenotype, with mutant \u0394133p53\u03b2-R280K being significantly the most potent. Importantly, depletion of the p53 protein isoforms with siTA that targets only the p53 proteins containing the transactivation domains (i.e TAp53\u03b1, TAp53\u03b2, TAp53\u03b3, \u039440p53\u03b1, \u039440p53\u03b2, \u039440p53\u03b3) without altering expression of \u0394133p53 isoform did not change the invasive activity of MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN.

However, expression of the mutant TAp53\u03b1 is not sufficient to explain why the triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and its highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN derived clone have different invasive activity while they both express the same mutant <i>TP53</i>-R280K gene. MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells showed a significantly higher invasiveness as compared to parental MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN expressed higher levels of \u0394133p53 mRNA variants and proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>).

Although SW480 and SW620 cells express the same mutant <i>TP53</i>-R273H gene, SW480 cells are far less invasive than the SW620 cells. Interestingly, SW480 cells express much less \u0394133p53 mRNAs than the SW620 cells. Importantly, depletion of endogenous \u0394133p53 isoforms from SW620 cells reduces cell invasion, despite unaltered and strong expression of mutant TAp53\u03b1 protein.

After several washes in TBS/Tween, membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Ig antibodies linked to HRP. Membranes were developed with ECL according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All scanned autoradiographs were quantified using AIDA/2D densitometry software."

Cells were transfected as monolayers before trypsinization and plating in 2% FCS-containing media on top of a thick layer (around 500\u2009\u03bcm) of Matrigel contained within the upper chamber of a Transwell. Controls were left untreated. The upper and lower chambers were then filled with, respectively, 2% FCS- containing media and media with 10% FCS, thus establishing a soluble gradient of chemo-attractant that permits cell invasion throughout the Matrigel. Cells were allowed to invade at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> through the gel before fixing for 15\u2009min in 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells that had invaded through the Matrigel were detected on the lower side of the filter by GFP fluorescence and counted. Six fields of the filter were counted and each assay was performed at least three times in triplicate for each condition."
