Many prokaryotes, archea, unicellular eukaryotes, and plants use a recently discovered family of F<sup>\u2212</sup> exporter proteins to lower cytoplasmic F<sup>\u2212</sup> levels to counteract the anion\u2019s toxicity. We show here that these \u2018Fluc\u2019 proteins, purified and reconstituted in liposomes and planar phospholipid bilayers, form constitutively open anion channels with extreme selectivity for F<sup>\u2212</sup> over Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>. The active channel is a dimer of identical or homologous subunits arranged in antiparallel transmembrane orientation. This dual-topology assembly has not previously been seen in ion channels but is known in multidrug transporters of the SMR family, and is suggestive of an evolutionary antecedent of the inverted repeats found within the subunits of many membrane transport proteins."

Two Fluc polypeptides associate to form a channel in the cell membrane, and Stockbridge et al. show that these two subunits are arranged in an antiparallel formation. Although this architecture is unprecedented among ion channels, it has been observed in carrier proteins in a range of organisms, and may indicate that Fluc proteins offer an evolutionary model for many carrier proteins."

This ubiquitous inorganic xenobiotic inhibits two enzymes essential for glycolytic metabolism and nucleic acid synthesis: enolase and pyrophosphatase (<a href=\"#bib18\">Marquis et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Samygina et al., 2007</a>). Accordingly, many unicellular organisms, as well as green plants, use F<sup>\u2212</sup> exporter proteins in their cell membranes to keep cytoplasmic F<sup>\u2212</sup> concentration low, thereby minimizing the anion\u2019s toxic effects (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Stockbridge et al., 2012</a>). Two separate, phylogenetically unrelated families of F<sup>\u2212</sup> exporters are now known: CLC<sup>F</sup>-type F<sup>\u2212</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters, a subclass of the widespread CLC superfamily of anion-transport proteins, and a group of small membrane proteins known as the \u2018crcB\u2019 family or, as we rename them here (to avoid confusion with the CLCs), the \u2018Fluc\u2019 family. Fluc proteins are widespread among unicellular organisms. Deletion of the single Fluc gene in <i>Escherichia coli</i> produces hypersensitivity to F<sup>\u2212</sup>, and this growth-phenotype may be rescued by F<sup>\u2212</sup> exporter genes from a variety of bacterial species (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Stockbridge et al., 2012</a>). By expressing, purifying, and functionally reconstituting several bacterial Fluc homologs, we demonstrate that these are highly selective F<sup>\u2212</sup>-conducting ion channels constructed as dimers of identical or homologous membrane-embedded domains arranged in an inverted-topology fashion. This type of molecular architecture is unprecedented among ion channels but is reminiscent of the dual-topology construction of small multidrug transporters (<a href=\"#bib24\">Rapp et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Schuldiner, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Morrison et al., 2012</a>) and of the inverted structural repeats appearing in many membrane transport proteins (<a href=\"#bib6\">Forrest et al., 2010</a>)."

A survey of 47 bacterial Flucs yielded several biochemically and electrophysiologically tractable homologues, nicknamed here Ec2, Bpe, La1, La2 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>); we also examine several fused constructs in which La1 and La2 are joined together in tandem into single polypeptides.

Liposomes were reconstituted under \u2018Poisson-dilution\u2019 conditions, that is, with Ec2 or Bpe at protein densities so low that 30\u201350% of the liposomes are devoid of protein, and most of the protein-containing liposomes carry only a single functional unit (<a href=\"#bib33\">Walden et al., 2007</a>). The liposomes were loaded with 150 mM each of KF and KCl and suspended in iso-osmotic solution containing 1 mM KF and KCl along with 300 mM K-isethionate (2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, a membrane-impermeant monovalent anion). Valinomycin (Vln), a K<sup>+</sup> ionophore, was then added to start the efflux by allowing the anions to move down their gradients. After protein-catalyzed ion efflux had reached completion, detergent was added to disrupt all the liposomes and reveal the protein-free fraction. Two striking results are apparent from the F<sup>\u2212</sup> and Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> efflux kinetics (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). First, the proteoliposomes are selectively permeable to F<sup>\u2212</sup>; Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> efflux is undetectable on this timescale, and similar experiments in the absence of F<sup>\u2212</sup> recapitulate this lack of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> transport. Second, Fluc-mediated F<sup>\u2212</sup> efflux is so fast that an initial rate measurement is precluded by the 1-s dead-time of the stirred-cuvette system. An estimate based on a 35-nm liposome radius leads to a lower limit of \u223c30,000 s<sup>\u22121</sup> for the single-Fluc transport rate. Since this is substantially higher than turnover of any conformational-cycle based membrane transporter (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jayaram et al., 2008</a>), it intimates that Fluc might be a F<sup>\u2212</sup> channel."

Initial experiments aimed at maximizing the electrical signal used liposomes with high protein density, 10\u201350 Fluc copies per liposome. When fused into planar bilayers, these liposomes evoke a robust increase in bilayer conductance in discrete steps (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), each of which reports a single liposome inserting its packet of ion-conducting proteins. The heterogeneity in step-size reflects the wide distribution of liposome size (<a href=\"#bib21\">Miller and Racker, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Accardi et al., 2004</a>). After a few minutes, liposomes are perfused away to stabilize the bilayer conductance, thereby allowing examination of its properties. We applied a series of pulses to voltages from \u2212100 mV to +150 mV and recorded the resulting currents to determine current-voltage (I\u2013V) relations under various ionic conditions. As shown in the inset to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, recorded in the presence of a salt gradient (300 mM NaF//30 mM NaF), the current appears as a \u2018leak\u2019 without any time- or voltage-dependent gating over a wide voltage range. The Fluc-mediated conductance is ideally selective for F<sup>\u2212</sup> over Na<sup>+</sup>, as seen from the zero-current voltage (reversal potential) of 53 mV, indistinguishable from the Nernst potential for F<sup>\u2212</sup> in the eightfold ionic activity gradient. High selectivity is further illustrated by the I\u2013V relation under bi-ionic conditions (300 mM NaF//300 mM NaCl), whose high reversal potential (119 mV) sets a lower limit of \u223c100 on the F<sup>\u2212</sup>/Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> permeability ratio."

Most of these insertion-steps are 1.8 pA under these conditions, equivalent to 7 pS, while a minority (&lt;20%) are 30\u201350% of this main step-size (illustrated in the third trace). The current shows occasional discrete fluctuations of two types: subsecond-timescale closing events and rare millisecond-timescale excursions to a substate of 50\u201360% of the main-state amplitude. The \u2018full-open\u2019 state persists &gt;95% of the time at all voltages (\u2212200 mV to +200 mV). Its high open probability further shows itself in an extended recording with three channels in the bilayer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, red trace) and from the amplitude histogram of a typical single channel (right panel lower histogram). These channels display voltage-independent, anion-selective characteristics in harmony with the macroscopic currents reported above, and their appearance is strictly dependent on reconstituting Fluc protein into the liposomes. Accordingly, we conclude that these unitary current-steps reflect activity of single Fluc proteins, with single-molecule turnover of \u223c10<sup>7</sup> F<sup>\u2212</sup> ions/sec at \u2212200 mV, a rate typical for ion channels and three to four orders of magnitude higher than the fastest known transporters. Thus, Fluc-Ec2 is a highly F<sup>\u2212</sup>-selective channel, a protein with a transmembrane pore through which F<sup>\u2212</sup> ion moves thermodynamically downhill by electrodiffusion."

Since an ion channel pore formed on a dimer axis is unprecedented, we also assessed Fluc\u2019s oligomeric state in its native habitat, the lipid bilayer. For this, we prepared Fluc-Bpe for single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) photobleaching experiments (<a href=\"#bib31\">Tombola et al., 2008</a>) by labeling a unique cysteine mutant, R29C, with Cy5-maleimide and reconstituting the protein at a very low density to favor single-channel liposomes. Upon illumination of these liposomes immobilized on a glass surface, the covalently attached fluorophores bleach in several minutes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), mostly in single and double steps (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Given the measured labeling efficiency (72%), the preponderance of single- and double-bleach events is fully consistent with a dimer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Fewer than 5% bleach in three or four steps, consistent with co-localization of the liposomes, but not with trimeric or tetrameric architecture for the channel. The same conclusion was obtained in a second dataset using a different Bpe mutant, T3C (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The twin Flucs possess abundantly charged loops; for one of the pair, a positive charge bias resides on the N- and C-termini and loop 2, while its homologous partner exhibits a converse bias, with excess positive charge on loops 1 and 3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Thus, according to the positive-inside rule for charge distribution in bacterial membrane proteins, (<a href=\"#bib32\">von Heijne, 1989</a>) one of the twins is predicted to insert into the membrane with the termini in the cytoplasm, and the second should be oppositely oriented. In striking contrast, the singletons display relatively balanced charge distributions on either face. In a genomic analysis of small membrane proteins, including Fluc, Rapp and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib24\">Rapp et al., 2006</a>) proposed that a balanced Arg+Lys distribution in loops indicates dual-topology oligomeric construction, in which subunits insert randomly in both transmembrane orientations, and those of opposite orientations associate together (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Do singletons like Ec2 and Bpe find partners in the membrane from a pool of randomly oriented Flucs to form inverted-topology homodimers? Do the fraternal Flucs find their homologous companions oppositely oriented in the membrane? A strong indication of antiparallel assembly appears in eukaryotic Fluc genomes. These genes all code for a pair of homologous Fluc sequences within a single open reading frame, and the linker connecting them contains a predicted TM helix (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This \u2018inversion linker\u2019 would force the second Fluc domain to adopt a transmembrane topology upside down with respect to the first. These genomic characteristics of Fluc channels constitute compelling evidence for dual-topology construction, but since no previously known ion channels are built in this way, experimental support is needed to test such sequence-based suggestions."

Even though the Ec2 subunit contains four amino groups, the dimer cannot be cross-linked by glutaraldehyde (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Since these amines are all located on the same face of the protein\u2014in loop 2 and both termini\u2014glutaraldehyde would be expected to cross-link a conventional parallel dimer but not an antiparallel dimer. With an additional lysine substituted on the opposite face, in loop 1 (R25K) or loop 3 (N95K), glutaraldehyde treatment now leads to the appearance of a dimer band on the PAGE gel (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Similarly, lysine-less Bpe is not cross-linked by glutaraldehyde, despite its solvent-accessible N-terminal amino group. Single lysine mutations on the side opposite to the N-terminus, in loop 1 (R29K) or loop 3 (R95K), beget a cross-linked dimer (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), whereas solvent-accessible lysines on loops 2 (R68K), on the C-terminus (R130K), or on both do not (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These results are in natural harmony with antiparallel orientation and are difficult to understand in terms of a parallel-topology dimer, but do not by themselves provide rigorous proof."

We expressed several constructs in which La1 and La2 are fused together with linkers designed to force the two domains into parallel or antiparallel orientations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). For the antiparallel construct, Laf-TM, the domains are linked with a non-dimerizing glycophorin-A TM helix (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lemmon et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Fleming et al., 1997</a>). Guided by eukaryotic Fluc sequences, we made loop 4 long and hydrophilic (18 residues), and loop 5 short (8 residues). The domains of the parallel constructs, LapA and LapB, are connected by hydrophilic linkers of 14 or 26 residues, respectively. All three fused constructs were expressed, purified, and reconstituted into liposomes, Laf-TM giving the best yield and chromatographic monodispersity (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Both parallel constructs have minimal transport activity, as shown for LapA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

This result strongly implies that functional Fluc channels are built with the two 4-TM subunits or domains in antiparallel transmembrane topology, an arrangement that prohibits axial symmetry along the pore (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

However, Fluc channels can work to effectively expel F<sup>\u2212</sup> in two ways. First, the negative membrane potential maintained by many classes of metabolizing cells tilts the anion\u2019s equilibrium towards expulsion. Second, the high pK<sub>a</sub> of HF (\u223c3.4), anomalous among haloacids, dictates that in weakly acidic environments, a significant amount of extracellular HF is present (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2012</a>). This membrane-permeant acid readily enters the cell and dissociates at the higher cytoplasmic pH. F<sup>\u2212</sup> would therefore accumulate far above its extracellular concentration if no conductive pathway for the anion were present in the membrane, but a passive F<sup>\u2212</sup> channel would undermine this weak-acid accumulation effect."

Liposome flux experiments establish a far more dramatic F<sup>\u2212</sup>/Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> selectivity than the 100-fold lower limit set by electrical recording. Anion-efflux assays measure Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> turnover &lt;30 ions/s, while in the same assays with F<sup>\u2212</sup>, unitary turnover rates exceed 30,000 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, and direct single-channel recording yields a turnover of 10<sup>6</sup>\u201310<sup>7</sup> F<sup>\u2212</sup>/sec. These values conservatively put F<sup>\u2212</sup>/Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> selectivity &gt;10<sup>4</sup>-fold, the highest value known between close analogs for any ion channel. It is this formidable selectivity that allows a bacterium or yeast to express a constitutively open F<sup>\u2212</sup> channel in its energy-coupling membrane while avoiding a massive Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> conductance that would otherwise catastrophically collapse its membrane potential. High ion selectivity requires that F<sup>\u2212</sup> be largely desolvated as it passes through the Fluc channel (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hille, 2001</a>), an energetically demanding step (&gt;100 kcal/mol) that has been an obstacle to the development of F<sup>\u2212</sup>-selective small-molecule ligands (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cametti and Rissanen, 2009</a>).

We are obliged to point out, however, that Fluc\u2019s high open probability precludes a definitive conclusion that the observed single-channel currents are mediated by a single pore rather than two in parallel, especially in light of the infrequent subconductance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

Oppositely oriented repeats within subunits are rare in ion channels, and so it is unclear whether this architecture provides particular mechanistic advantages for Flucs. The inverted structural repeats of transporters almost certainly evolved from gene duplication and subsequent fusion of sequences coding for dimeric proteins with an odd number of TM helices (<a href=\"#bib35\">Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Forrest and Rudnick, 2009</a>). The Fluc family obligingly provides examples in modern genomes of all stages along such an evolutionary pathway, including duplicated gene-pairs in bacteria and fused homologues in eukaryotes. Fusion of the latter genes must have required evolutionary gymnastics to capture a TM helix as an inversion linker for maintaining antiparallel topology of subunits with an even number of membrane crossings."

A liposome sample containing 300 mM KF, 25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7 was diluted 200-fold into 2 ml of a degassed isotonic solution containing 300 mM K- or Na-isethionate, 25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7 in a stirred cuvette, and efflux was initiated by 1 \u03bcM Vln. Water efflux maintaining osmotic balance leads to time-dependent shrinking and flattening of the initially spherical liposomes, accompanied by a \u223c10% increase in 90\u00b0 light scattering (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jin et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Stockbridge et al., 2012</a>). After transport was complete, p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazine (FCCP) was added to the cuvette, effectively making the protein-free liposomes specifically permeable to F<sup>\u2212</sup> to provide a quantitative measurement of the fraction of liposomes, f<sub>0</sub>, free of Fluc channels. For Poisson-dump experiments, data were collected for proteins from four independent preparations of CLC-ec1 and Fluc-Ec2, and two independent preparations of Fluc-Bpe, Fluc-Laf, Fluc-LapA, and Fluc-LapB."

Liposomes (0.5 \u03bcl added to the cis solution) were fused into the bilayer, with 300 mM or 30 mM NaF, 15 mM Mops-NaOH pH 7, in the cis or trans chamber respectively, trans defined as electrical ground. Ionic conditions for recording were established by perfusion of either chamber. Macroscopic I\u2013V relations were determined with families of voltage pulses (0.5\u20131 s) from a holding potential of zero to command-voltages from \u2212100 to +150 mV in 10-mV increments. Current output from a Axopatch 200A amplifier was low-pass filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2 kHz in pCLAMP software. Voltages were corrected for junction potential, &lt;3 mV. Signals for single-channel analysis were subsequently filtered digitally at 100 Hz."

M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University. Briefly, purified protein was passed over a Superdex-75 SEC column equilibrated in 400 mM NaF, 10 mM MES pH 6.5, 5 mM DM and coupled in-line with light scattering, refractive index, and UV detectors. Ovalbumin, transferase, bovine serum albumin, and carbonic anhydrase were used as standards. The molecular mass was determined in two ways: by the three-detector method (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hayashi et al., 1989</a>), and from light scattering intensity at several angles (ASTRA software, Wyatt Technology Corp.)."

Liposomes were diluted \u223c10<sup>5</sup>-fold in reconstitution buffer, and loaded into the flow chamber, where they spontaneously adhere to the glass surface. The fluorescence from each liposome was measured using a custom through-objective TIRF microscope built for single molecule detection (<a href=\"#bib8\">Friedman et al., 2006</a>). Cy5 fluorescence was measured by illuminating the sample with a helium-neon 633 nm laser (75 \u00b5W power) and collecting the emitted light through a 633 nm long-pass filter (1 s per frame). Each spot was centered inside a 3 \u00d7 3 pixel area using linear interpolation and drift-correction, and the intensity was integrated over the duration of the experiment."

This interesting and novel paper from the Miller lab reports the discovery and characterization of a new class of fluoride-conducting ion channels. These channels, referred to as \u201cFluc\u201d, were found as a family of membrane proteins under the control of an F<sup>-</sup>-sensing riboswitch. Here, the Miller lab expressed and purified several homologs, and find that they mediate dissipative and highly selective F<sup>-</sup> fluxes in liposomes and lipid bilayer membranes. Single channel events present themselves when liposomes containing low concentrations of Fluc proteins are fused to lipid bilayers, conclusively revealing the functional classification of these proteins. Simple labeling experiments sketch out a likely transmembrane topology. Several lines of evidence point to a dimeric functional unit, including crosslinking, \u201cpoisson-dump\u201d assays, and single-molecule photobleaching. Surprisingly, the protein appears to form antiparallel dimers, as has been recently described for the multidrug transporter EmrE but for few, if any, other native membrane proteins. The work is thorough and rigorous, and the arguments are strong and convincing."
