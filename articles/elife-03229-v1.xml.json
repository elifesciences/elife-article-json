To dissect the chemical signals and the genes mediating this association, we investigated the effect of an oriental beetle sex pheromone on the development and behavior of the nematode <i>Pristionchus pacificus</i>. We found that while the beetle pheromone is attractive to <i>P. pacificus</i> adults, the pheromone arrests embryo development, paralyzes J2 larva, and inhibits exit of dauer larvae. To uncover the mechanism that regulate insect pheromone sensitivity, a newly identified mutant, <i>Ppa-obi-1</i>, is used to reveal the molecular links between altered attraction toward the beetle pheromone, as well as hypersensitivity to its paralyzing effects. <i>Ppa-obi-1</i> encodes lipid-binding domains and reaches its highest expression in various cell types, including the amphid neuron sheath and excretory cells. Our data suggests that the beetle host pheromone may be a species-specific volatile synomone that coevolved with necromeny."
