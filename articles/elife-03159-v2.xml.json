                    "text": "Endocannabinoids are recently recognized regulators of brain development, but molecular effectors downstream of type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R)-activation remain incompletely understood. We report atypical coupling of neuronal CB1Rs, after activation by endo- or exocannabinoids such as the marijuana component \u2206<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol, to heterotrimeric G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> proteins that triggers rapid and reversible non-muscle myosin II (NM II) dependent contraction of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, through a Rho-GTPase and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). This induces rapid neuronal remodeling, such as retraction of neurites and axonal growth cones, elevated neuronal rigidity, and reshaping of somatodendritic morphology. Chronic pharmacological inhibition of NM II prevents cannabinoid-induced reduction of dendritic development in vitro and leads, similarly to blockade of endocannabinoid action, to excessive growth of corticofugal axons into the sub-ventricular zone in vivo. Our results suggest that CB1R can rapidly transform the neuronal cytoskeleton through actomyosin contractility, resulting in cellular remodeling events ultimately able to affect the brain architecture and wiring."

We report atypical coupling of neuronal CB1Rs, after activation by endo- or exocannabinoids such as the marijuana component \u2206<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol, to heterotrimeric G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> proteins that triggers rapid and reversible non-muscle myosin II (NM II) dependent contraction of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, through a Rho-GTPase and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). This induces rapid neuronal remodeling, such as retraction of neurites and axonal growth cones, elevated neuronal rigidity, and reshaping of somatodendritic morphology. Chronic pharmacological inhibition of NM II prevents cannabinoid-induced reduction of dendritic development in vitro and leads, similarly to blockade of endocannabinoid action, to excessive growth of corticofugal axons into the sub-ventricular zone in vivo. Our results suggest that CB1R can rapidly transform the neuronal cytoskeleton through actomyosin contractility, resulting in cellular remodeling events ultimately able to affect the brain architecture and wiring."

In both the embryonic and adult brains, eCB action is predominantly mediated by CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs), which is one of the most highly expressed neuronal G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), known to couple to G<sub>i/o</sub> heterotrimeric proteins (<a href=\"#bib21\">Howlett, 2005</a>), but the molecular mechanisms by which CB1R shapes developing neurons remain mostly unknown. The exact role of eCBs in shaping the neuronal architecture is also under debate, since several reports indicate neurite retraction, while others found the induction of neurite outgrowth following CB1R activation (review in <a href=\"#bib14\">Gaffuri et al., 2012</a>). Likewise, currently it is difficult to reconcile the locally repulsive effects of eCBs, reported at axonal growth cones (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berghuis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Argaw et al., 2011</a>), and their role of mediating efficient directional axonal growth and shaping well-fasciculated axonal tracts (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mulder et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Vitalis et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Watson et al., 2008</a>)."

                        "text": "During neuronal development, an elaborate balance of positive and negative regulators is necessary to establish precise neuronal structure. This structure is stabilized by the cytoskeleton, which, similar to non-neuronal cells, is composed of two major polymers, the highly plastic filamentous-actin (F-actin) and the more stable microtubule (MT) networks. Actin filaments are often cross-linked to a molecular motor protein, the non-muscle myosin II (NM II), whose contractile properties further endow the actomyosin network with highly dynamic control of cell behavior and architecture (<a href=\"#bib50\">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</a>). The cytoskeleton is mainly regulated by Rho-like GTPases that control a wide variety of effector mechanisms such as actin polymerization and branching, actomyosin contractility, focal adhesions, microtubule dynamics, and membrane transport (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kaibuchi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hall and Lalli, 2010</a>). Downstream protein kinases such as the Rho-associated, coiled coil-containing kinase (ROCK) are the key activator proteins of these convergent-signaling pathways. Interestingly, ROCK is associated with particular CB1R-induced phenotypes. In CB1R-over-expressing B103 cells, the endocannabinoid anandamide induces cell rounding via ROCK (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ishii and Chun, 2002</a>), and CB1R activation results in RhoA- and ROCK-dependent repulsion of growth cones of cultured hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berghuis et al., 2007</a>), but neither the coupling mechanism of CB1R to ROCK nor the cytoskeletal targets downstream of CB1R-activated ROCK are identified yet. Since Rho-activated effectors operate over a large range of spatial and temporal scales, understanding of eCB-mediated structural plasticity requires the identification of the precise spatial and temporal dynamics of CB1R-mediated cytoskeletal modifications."

We expressed, in addition to LifeAct-mCherry, a GFP-tagged version of End-binding protein 3 (EB3-eGFP), which binds to endogenous microtubule (MT) plus ends without changing MT growth parameters and thus allows the visualization of MT structure and dynamics (<a href=\"#bib44\">Stepanova et al., 2003</a>). Indeed, MTs in the entire neuron were labeled in green, with many bright comet-like fluorescent dashes in all the neuronal compartments, moving randomly in the cell body and directionally in axons and distal dendrites, representing dynamic MT plus ends (<a href=\"#bib44\">Stepanova et al., 2003</a>). During 100 nM WIN-induced retraction the dynamics of the two main cytoskeletal polymers, F-actin and MTs, was remarkably different (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). A significant portion of F-actin redistributed in the first 2\u20134 min after stimulation from its original location in growth cones into a more homogenous cable-like pattern on the distal axonal shaft (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, MTs bent during the same time frame forming periodic local loops (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,A\u2019,B</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) before finally consolidating into a homogenously labeled retraction bulb. The F-actin cables (bundles of F-actin filaments, which are not separately resolved here by diffraction-limited microscopy), often co-localized with regions displaying periodic bends in MTs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B'</a>), suggesting that an F-actin-related force pulls strongly enough to bend MTs. This effect was not the result of the over-expression of the cytoskeletal markers EB3-eGFP or LifeAct-mCherry, since we could observe similar periodic MT bends, detected by post hoc immunohistochemistry, in neurons not expressing these markers (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

                                "text": "A likely candidate for the generation of such rapid F-actin-related force, which is capable of bending microtubules, is non-muscle myosin II (NM II), an ATPase protein with actin cross-linking and contractile properties, which is activated by the phosphorylation of its regulatory light chain. The two main activators of NM II are myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and ROCK, the latter being already known to participate in CB1R-induced cytoskeletal modifications (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ishii and Chun, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berghuis et al., 2007</a>). This raises the possibility that ROCK- and/or MLCK-induced NM II contractility is responsible for the force-generation reported above. In order to directly investigate the implication of NM II, we pre-incubated neurons, for 20 min before WIN stimulation, with the highly selective NM II ATPase inhibitor blebbistatin (25 \u00b5M) that blocks NM II in an actin-detached state without perturbing F-actin polymerization (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kovacs et al., 2004</a>). Blebbistatin pre-treatment induced substantial morphological changes of the growth cone, which continued to move forward in a rather disorganized fashion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), typically transforming the growth cone lamellipodia into several dynamically advancing filopodia, as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rosner et al., 2007</a>).

First, we showed that NMII-dependent growth cone contraction is not a result of CB1R over-expression, since treatment with blebbistatin (25 \u00b5M) or the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 \u00b5M) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) significantly inhibited endogenous CB1R-induced retraction of growth cones, previously presented on <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>, in neurons transfected only with LifeAct-mCherry and EB3-eGFP. Then we used neurons expressing Flag-CB1R-eCFP, LifeAct-mCherry, and EB3-eGFP, our high-throughput experimental read-out, to characterize in detail the molecular mechanism of CB1R-induced actomyosin contractility. The amplitude of WIN-mediated retraction was significantly reduced by pre-treatment with the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase (1 \u00b5g/ml, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 \u00b5M) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), but not by the MLCK-specific inhibitor ML-7 (30 \u00b5M) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Treatment with the inactive (R)-(+)-blebbistatin (25 \u00b5M) stereoisomer was ineffective (data not shown). The implication of neuronal NM II was further confirmed by siRNA knock-down of endogenous NM IIA and NM IIB (<a href=\"#bib36\">Miserey-Lenkei et al., 2010</a>), which resulted in significant reduction of WIN-mediated contractility as compared to control (anti-luciferase) siRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>)."

Notably, treatment with pertussis toxin (100 ng/\u00b5l), a specific inhibitor of G<sub>i/o</sub> heterotrimeric proteins, which are generally considered as the main signaling pathway of CB1Rs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Howlett, 2005</a>), did not decrease significantly cannabinoid-induced growth cone retraction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), similarly to a previously reported finding for ROCK-mediated induced cell rounding after anandamide treatment (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ishii and Chun, 2002</a>). Another family of heterotrimeric G-proteins, G<sub>12/</sub>G<sub>13</sub>, may mediate rapid growth cone collapse, neurite retraction, and cell rounding in neuronal cell lines in response to certain GPCR agonists such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Katoh et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kranenburg et al., 1999</a>). Therefore, we inactivated endogenous G<sub>12/</sub>G<sub>13</sub> proteins in our hippocampal neuronal cultures by using two pools of 4 different siRNAs directed against rat G<sub>12</sub>- or G<sub>13</sub>-alpha proteins, respectively. Used separately, neither pool decreased WIN-induced growth cone retraction as compared to control (anti-luciferase) siRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). However, when we combined together 2 siRNAs of each pool, each resulting mixed pools efficiently inhibited WIN-mediated contractility (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). These results show that the presence of either G<sub>12</sub> or G<sub>13</sub> is necessary and sufficient for CB1R-induced actomyosin contraction."

In organotypic slices prepared from the offspring between postnatal day 4 and 6 (P4\u2013P6), numerous corticofugal F-actin-rich growth cones from layer II\u2013III pyramidal neurons could be visualized by video microscopy at 48 hr after slice preparation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Application of 1 \u00b5M WIN resulted in significant retraction of growth cones (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>) through activation of CB1R since this effect could be prevented by pre-treatment with 5 \u00b5M AM281 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This retraction displayed slower kinetics ex vivo than in vitro (compare to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) probably due to limited diffusion of the highly hydrophobic WIN into the slice and/or into differences in adhesive and mechanistic properties within the organotypic brain slice. Previously, we have shown that at around P5, cortical projection neurons still express CB1R, albeit at lower levels than at birth (<a href=\"#bib51\">Vitalis et al., 2008</a>), thus we have replicated these experiments by expressing only the cytoskeletal markers EB3-eGFP and LifeAct-mCherry. WIN-mediated activation of endogenous CB1Rs typically led to arrest or retraction of numerous growth cones (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,E</a>). The relatively mild averaged effect is probably due to the variable level of endogenous CB1R expression in these neurons. Importantly, pre-treatment with blebbistatin (25 \u00b5M) efficiently blocked this effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>)."

The mouse neuroblastoma-derived Neuro2A cell line, a widely used model of neuronal physiology, presents simpler morphology than primary hippocampal neurons, enabling high-resolution quantitative measure of cellular structure and biomechanical characteristics. The Neuro2A cells grow neurites in culture, and we observed that F-actin accumulates in the shaft and extremity of these neurites as well as in highly dynamic filopodia and in patches of the cell cortex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). CB1R-eGFP showed a characteristic distribution between the plasma membrane and endosomes, as described previously in various non-polarized cell-types (<a href=\"#bib31\">Leterrier et al., 2004</a>). Treatment with 100 nM WIN resulted in rapid rounding of the cell body and in retraction of neurites, leaving behind retraction-fiber-like remnants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). F-actin was reorganized and accumulated at the end of the retraction bulb and under the plasma membrane of the cell body. This WIN-induced cell rounding could be blocked by blebbistatin treatment (25 \u00b5M) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), suggesting that the observed rapid morphological changes are due to a CB1R-induced general contraction of the actomyosin cell cortex, which is the association of plasma membrane lipids and the underlying actin filament network."

When combined, these two effects result in an overall increase of cell cortex rigidity or stiffness (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stewart et al., 2010</a>), while local and temporary detachment of the plasma membrane from the actomyosin cortex results in characteristic blebbing (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cunningham, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Charras et al., 2008</a>). Marked cell rounding, F-actin reorganization, and the presence of retraction fibers suggested that an analogous intracellular mechanism might be implicated in the above-reported cannabinoid-induced reorganization of the Neuro2A cells.

Averaged AFM measurements in force mode with a 1-\u00b5m spherical bead attached to the cantilever (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) indicated that the stiffness (Young's modulus) of unstimulated individual cells was approximately 300 Pa, close to values reported in acutely isolated hippocampal glial cells and neurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lu et al., 2006</a>). For this series of experiments, cells were grown on uncoated plastic, a highly adhesive substrate, in order to minimize the displacement of Neuro2A cells during the measurement. WIN stimulation led to an overall rapid and transient increase of cell stiffness at different locations on the same cell, with the exception of the trailing edge (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C4</a>). As the contribution of the underlying coverslip was significant in neurites (compare ordinate scale of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C1</a> with <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C2\u20134</a>), in the following experiments we have centered our force measurements on the cell bodies, corresponding to the positions 2 and 3 on <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>. The important transient WIN-induced increase in cell stiffness was absent during incubation with vehicle solution and could be prevented by pre-treatment with blebbistatin (25 \u00b5M) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), showing that activation of NM II is necessary to induce the measured changes."

After CB1R agonist application, the cell changed shape drastically, acquiring a more spherical morphology.

Similarly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of CB1R leads to more complex somatodendritic morphology in septal cholinergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib27\">Keimpema et al., 2013</a>). These data suggest that, in addition to axons, where CB1Rs are naturally targeted through transcytotic targeting (<a href=\"#bib32\">Leterrier et al., 2006</a>), the transitory presence of CB1Rs on the somatodendritic membrane may allow efficient coupling to growth inhibitory signaling pathways. It was reported that increased NM II activity, through constitutively active MLCK or RhoA, decreases both the length and number of neurites and, consequently, delays or abolishes the development of neuronal polarity in cultured hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kollins et al., 2009</a>).

CB1R acts through heterotrimeric G<sub>12/</sub>G<sub>13</sub> proteins, Rho GTPase, and ROCK to induce the contractile interaction of NM II with F-actin. This contraction triggers the retraction of the actin-rich growth cone of the most distal 60\u201370 \u00b5m of the axon in cultured hippocampal neurons and in cortical neurons in organotypic slices. Pharmacological inhibition of either CB1Rs or NM II during brain development leads to excessive growth of corticofugal axons in vivo, suggesting that CB1R-induced actomyosin contractility is necessary for the correct pathfinding by mediating their repulsion from the sub-ventricular zone. This contractile behavior is not limited to the growth cone since CB1R-induced actomyosin contraction leads to neurite retraction, cell rounding, and a significant elevation in cell rigidity in the Neuro2A cells. Similarly, in the somatodendritic region of cultured hippocampal neurons, distal regions of dendrites retract while proximal parts broaden. Finally, ROCK and NM II mediate the inhibitory effect of chronic CB1R activation on dendrite development, by increasing the natural contractile tone of neurons."

In neurons, NM II is also involved in diverse aspects of cell movement, such as neuronal migration and the structural organization and efficient extension of the growth cone, which requires an intricate balance between dynein, microtubules, actin, and different myosin II isoforms (<a href=\"#bib49\">Vallee et al., 2009</a>). Remarkably, previous in vitro results have shown that NM II is important for turning in response to boundaries of substrate-bound laminin-1 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Turney and Bridgman, 2005</a>) and that pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing of NM II leads to disorganization of the growth cone, allowing rapid axon extension over inhibitory substrates (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hur et al., 2011</a>). In the present study, we report a comparable in vivo effect, by showing that blebbistatin treatment leads to elevated axonal invasion of the embryonic sub-ventricular zone (SVZ). This territory, which is populated by proliferating neuronal progenitors, is typically avoided by corticofugal axons during their progression towards sub-cortical target zones. To our knowledge, these results show for the first time the existence of NM II-mediated axonal repulsion in vivo, suggesting that mobilization of NM II participates in the correct guidance of corticofugal axonal projections. Since pharmacological CB1R blockade has similar effects to NM II inhibition (i.e., excessive axonal growth), a likely scenario suggests that the endocannabinoid 2-AG, whose synthesizing enzyme DAGL\u03b1 is specifically expressed at high levels by proliferating progenitor cells of the SVZ (<a href=\"#bib17\">Goncalves et al., 2008</a>), acts through CB1Rs to repulse invading corticofugal axons through NM II-mediated growth cone retraction."

This NM II-dependent contraction leads to the characteristic periodic bending of microtubules. This particular phenotype was similarly observed during strong NM II-mediated retraction in DRG neurons after the activation of the LPA receptor (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bouquet et al., 2007</a>) or after treatment with Sema 3A (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gallo et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wylie and Chantler, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gallo, 2006</a>;).

Basal cell-autonomous or paracrine activation of CB1Rs would yield relatively weak tonic inhibition of growth in the majority of developmental settings in all neuronal sub-regions where F-actin is present. Local growth-promoting effectors at the growth cone, such as the self-amplifying autocrine promoter BDNF (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cheng et al., 2011</a>) or netrin-1 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Argaw et al., 2011</a>), may locally surmount this weak negative tone. The resulting \u2018channeling\u2019 effect of widespread CB1R-mediated weak inhibition would help the neuron to focus its resources to a limited amount of growth locations, leading to more efficient polarized growth. Such weak inhibition may serve also to coordinated guidance of axonal fascicles in the brain where moderate production of eCBs by nearby axons would be used as a repulsion cue that helps axons to grow straightly towards their target. However, when growth cones reach a region highly enriched with eCBs, such as the sub-ventricular zone, enhanced eCB signaling could result in growth cone arrest, repulsion, or collapse, efficiently steering out CB1R-expressing axons from these areas. Finally, CB1R-induced actomyosin contractility may also contribute to establish functionally adequate somatodendritic morphology, acting as a negative regulator of dendritic growth."

The authors use a series of pharmacological or gene-silencing manipulations in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo to show that activation of CB1Rs leads to leads to changes in the neuronal cytoskeleton in retraction events that require myosin ii, rock and Galpha12/13. They nicely show through in vivo experiments that manipulation of CB1Rs and myosin ii retraction pathway they characterized in vitro may be required for extension of growth cones to their appropriate location within the developing cortex. Moreover, they elegantly use AFM to corroborate that changes in their pathway lead to predictable alterations in tension of the actin rich cortex in the Neuro2A cell system."

Endocannabinoids and their receptors (e.g. CB1R) have been already demonstrated to be involved in growth cone repulsion and directional guidance. The authors investigate further the mechanistic cytoskeletal process involving CB1R activation and growth cone retraction. By combining over-expression of CB1R in dissociated hippocampal neurons and pharmacological experiments, the authors claim that CB1R-actvivation results in rapid retraction of actin-rich growth cone domains through MLCK/ROCK-mediated NM II activation. Overall, the impact of the results would be significantly improved if they addressed the following points:"
