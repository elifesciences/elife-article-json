In fact, to do this the brain must process a lot of complex information."

This is a form of population coding: that is, it involves many neurons firing in response to a given visual image, rather than just one neuron firing. Neurons with gain field coding represent both the location of objects on the retina and the angle of gaze (i.e., where we are looking in space). From this information, computational models have shown that the location of objects in space can be calculated (<a href=\"#bib6\">Pouget and Sejnowski, 1997</a>). However, for this mechanism to work effectively, the angle of gaze must be reliably represented and rapidly updated after an eye movement. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Arnulf Graf and Richard Andersen of the California Institute of Technology show that the neural population code for eye movements and eye position in a region of the brain called the parietal cortex is accurate, and is updated rapidly when eye movements are planned and executed (<a href=\"#bib4\">Graf and Andersen, 2014</a>)."

Therefore, eye movements were made in darkness and the planned movement had to be remembered by the monkey. The task also separated the direction of the eye movement from the position of the eye before and after the movement. This allowed Graf and Andersen to examine, unambiguously, whether information in the neural population code was representing either\u2014or both\u2014current and future eye position signals."

This finding builds on existing evidence that eye position can be decoded from area LIP before and after a saccade to a visual target (<a href=\"#bib5\">Morris et al., 2013</a>)."

(<a href=\"#bib8\">Xu et al., 2012</a>), Graf and Andersen show that population coding of the post saccadic eye position signal was updated quickly after the saccade target was shown. There are two possible reasons for the discrepancies between these studies. First, Xu et al. assumed that eye position information could be characterised by a number called the gain field index. Xu et al. also only examined single neurons. Even though individual neurons represent fixation location and eye movements, different combinations of eye positions and target locations can cause some neurons to respond in the same way. However, looking at a population of neurons removes this ambiguity so that it is clear what the neurons are actually responding to\u2014and this can be achieved with decoding analyses (<a href=\"#bib2\">Georgopoulos et al., 1986</a>)."

Distributed representations can be non-intuitive\u2014but they are the way the brain represents and processes information. Graf and Anderson illustrate the use of decoding to extract information from a distributed representation across a population of neurons, and show that this approach can resolve debates about neural coding. This study also points to the importance of recording from large neural populations when investigating how complex tasks are performed, so the space in which population coding applies is fully explored."
