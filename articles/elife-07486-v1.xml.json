The requirements for these signals, however, vary from dispensable to essential in different infections. We examined the underlying mechanisms of this differential T cell costimulation dependence and found that the viral context determined the dependence on CD28/B7-mediated costimulation for expansion of naive and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicating that the requirement for costimulatory signals is not imprinted. Notably, related to the high-level costimulatory molecule expression induced by LCMV, CD28/B7-mediated costimulation was dispensable for accumulation of LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells because of redundancy with the costimulatory pathways induced by TNF receptor family members (i.e. CD27, OX40, and 4-1BB). Type I IFN signaling in viral-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is slightly redundant with costimulatory signals. These results highlight that pathogen-specific conditions differentially and uniquely dictate the utilization of costimulatory pathways allowing shaping of effector and memory antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses."
