The essential mechanistic role of Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis in this reaction is still incompletely understood. Here, we show that although Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis is essential to initiate DNA replication, it is not essential for MCM loading. Using purified proteins, an ATPase-defective Cdc6 mutant \u2018Cdc6-E224Q\u2019 promoted MCM loading on DNA. Cdc6-E224Q also promoted MCM binding at origins in vivo but cells remained blocked in G1-phase. If after loading MCM, Cdc6-E224Q was degraded, cells entered an apparently normal S-phase and replicated DNA, a phenotype seen with two additional Cdc6 ATPase-defective mutants. Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis is therefore required for Cdc6 disengagement from the pre-RC after helicase loading to advance subsequent steps in helicase activation in vivo."

The essential mechanistic role of Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis in this reaction is still incompletely understood. Here, we show that although Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis is essential to initiate DNA replication, it is not essential for MCM loading. Using purified proteins, an ATPase-defective Cdc6 mutant \u2018Cdc6-E224Q\u2019 promoted MCM loading on DNA. Cdc6-E224Q also promoted MCM binding at origins in vivo but cells remained blocked in G1-phase. If after loading MCM, Cdc6-E224Q was degraded, cells entered an apparently normal S-phase and replicated DNA, a phenotype seen with two additional Cdc6 ATPase-defective mutants. Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis is therefore required for Cdc6 disengagement from the pre-RC after helicase loading to advance subsequent steps in helicase activation in vivo."

The process of copying the DNA requires a group or \u2018complex\u2019 of proteins called the MCM helicase complex that binds to this double-stranded DNA molecule. MCM then separates the two DNA strands to allow the production of new DNA strands in a process that uses the original strands as templates. After copying, the two resulting DNA double helices each have one of the original strands and one new strand."

These experiments show that normal Cdc6 enzymes detach from the MCM complex after the energy is used to allow DNA copying and cell division to proceed. However, the mutant Cdc6 enzymes remain stuck to the complex, which blocks DNA copying. In cells, if the mutant Cdc6 enzymes are deliberately destroyed after the MCM complex binds to DNA, DNA copying proceeds normally. This implies that Cdc6 inhibits MCM activity as long it remains bound to the complex."

An inactive MCM (mini-chromosome maintenance) double hexamer is first loaded on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in late M- to early G1-phase and then activated in a subsequent step that requires conserved protein kinases (<a href=\"#bib18\">Labib, 2010</a>). Cdc6 is a AAA+ ATPase family member that binds ORC (origin recognition complex), and together these proteins function as an MCM \u2018helicase loader\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Liang et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cocker et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Neuwald et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wendler et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Duderstadt and Berger, 2013</a>). Since the weakly hydrolyzed ATP-\u03b3-S analogue traps an OCCM complex on DNA containing ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1 and a single hexamer of MCM (all six MCM subunits are also AAA+ proteins), double hexamer loading requires ATP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sun et al., 2013</a>). Following MCM complex loading, Cdt1 and Cdc6 disengage from the pre-RC to allow additional protein loading complexes to activate the MCM helicase (<a href=\"#bib42\">Yardimci and Walter, 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "The AAA+ family shares multiple conserved motifs, including Walker A and B motifs that promote ATP binding and hydrolysis, as well as sensor 1 and 2 motifs that help couple changes in ATP/ADP occupancy with protein conformational changes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wendler et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Duderstadt and Berger, 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Early mutational analysis of the Walker A motif agreed that budding yeast Cdc6 must bind ATP to execute its essential function (<a href=\"#bib25\">Perkins and Diffley, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Wang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Weinreich et al., 1999</a>). However, there have been conflicting reports on the role of Cdc6 ATPase activity in pre-RC assembly and yeast viability. Two different mutants altering the Walker B motif (required for ATP hydrolysis) gave opposite phenotypes: a Cdc6-E224G mutant was lethal and acted as a dominant negative mutant when overexpressed (<a href=\"#bib25\">Perkins and Diffley, 1998</a>), but a double Cdc6-D223A, E224A mutant was viable suggesting the Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis might not be required for its essential function (<a href=\"#bib39\">Weinreich et al., 1999</a>). A Walker B DExx&gt;AAxx mutant in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> Cdc6 (Cdc18) was also shown to be viable (<a href=\"#bib21\">Liu et al., 2000</a>). A polar residue in the sensor 1 motif at the tip of the \u03b24-strand (corresponding to N263 in budding yeast Cdc6) is also required for ATP hydrolysis in various AAA+ proteins (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wendler et al., 2012</a>). Mutation of Cdc6 N263 to A has been reported to result in normal growth at 24\u00b0C and no growth at 37\u00b0C in one study (<a href=\"#bib31\">Schepers and Diffley, 2001</a>) but was lethal at 30\u00b0C in another (<a href=\"#bib36\">Takahashi et al., 2002</a>). Alanine mutation of the Cdc6 sensor 2 arginine (R332) had a modest effect on growth, suggesting it does not perform an essential role (<a href=\"#bib31\">Schepers and Diffley, 2001</a>), but mutation of R332 to E was lethal (<a href=\"#bib36\">Takahashi et al., 2002</a>). Lastly, AAA+ members typically form multisubunit protein assemblies and an \u2018R-finger\u2019 residue in one subunit can stimulate ATP hydrolysis in an adjacent subunit. The R-finger is named for an analogous arginine first discovered in the Ras GTPase-activating protein, p120<sup>GAP</sup> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Scheffzek et al., 1997</a>). However, a triple alanine mutant spanning the budding yeast Cdc6 R-finger (R274) gave no growth phenotype (<a href=\"#bib31\">Schepers and Diffley, 2001</a>), suggesting that the Cdc6 R-finger is not required for stimulating either ORC or MCM ATPase activity."

Furthermore, since the requirement for Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis can be bypassed by degrading Cdc6 ATPase defective proteins after MCM loading, ATP hydrolysis is likely instead required to disengage Cdc6 from the pre-RC (presumably an ORC-Cdc6-MCM intermediate) to allow subsequent steps in MCM helicase activation."

An alanine scan across the yeast Cdc6 Walker B motif revealed that only the E224A mutation caused inviability (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, top panel). Mutation of E224 to G (<a href=\"#bib25\">Perkins and Diffley, 1998</a>), L, or Q also caused inviability (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, middle panel). The other single alanine mutants with the Walker B motif exhibited nearly wild type growth over a wide temperature range (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Expression of plasmid-borne <i>cdc6-E224G</i>, <i>-A</i>, <i>-L</i>, and <i>-Q</i> mutants from the Cdc6 promoter showed that all mutants were dominant negative for growth in otherwise wild-type yeast cells, with the E224Q mutant having the greatest effect (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, all double and triple mutant combinations that changed the preceding aspartate D223 together with E224A or E224Q restored viability, including a triple mutant that removed all acidic residues from the Cdc6 DEMD Walker B motif (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, bottom panel). The growth properties of the double and triple mutants were surprisingly robust with the exception of the triple alanine mutants, \u2018AAAD\u2019, \u2018AAMA\u2019, and \u2018AEAA\u2019, which were temperature sensitive at 37\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The results of the mutational scan are summarized in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>. These data show that Cdc6 E224 is the only residue in the Walker B motif required for viability. Furthermore, the relative ease with which the requirement for the E224 catalytic residue could be bypassed by the intragenic suppressor mutations suggested that ATP hydrolysis might not be mechanistically coupled to MCM loading."

ORC, Cdc6 (wild type or mutant), Cdt1, and MCM were incubated at 24\u00b0C with replication origin-containing plasmid DNA linked to magnetic beads and then washed under low salt conditions. This allows detection of proteins specifically bound to origin DNA. Wild type and both mutant Cdc6 proteins bound to ORC and promoted binding of MCM to DNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, low salt). Interestingly, the E224Q mutant had a higher amount of Cdt1 bound than the wild type or Cdc6-NQ complex, as reported for a Cdc6-E224G mutant (<a href=\"#bib27\">Randell et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fernandez-Cid et al., 2013</a>), suggesting build up of an intermediate Cdt1-containing complex prior to dhMCM (double hexamer MCM) loading. \u2018Loaded\u2019 dhMCM that encircles dsDNA is resistant to a 0.5 M high salt wash but ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1 and any MCM proteins that are merely \u2018associated\u2019 with DNA are not. Both mutant Cdc6 proteins were capable of loading MCM protein, albeit less efficiently than wild-type Cdc6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, high salt). The increased Cdt1 retention in low salt by Cdc6-E224Q was also seen in reactions treated with a more stringent (0.3 M K acetate) low salt wash (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In addition, Cdc6-E224Q protein was retained within the low salt complex but wild-type Cdc6 and the Cdc6-NQ protein were significantly less stable (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, Cdc6 is marked with an arrowhead). Cdc6-E224G is also defective in dissociating from the pre-RC relative to wild-type Cdc6 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Coster et al., 2014</a>). Cdc6 ATP binding is required for interaction with ORC and for pre-RC assembly (<a href=\"#bib25\">Perkins and Diffley, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Weinreich et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Speck et al., 2005</a>) and since Cdc6-E224Q and Cdc6-NQ proteins formed similar pre-RC complexes to wild-type Cdc6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>, low salt), they are not defective in ATP binding."

Therefore, Cdc6-E224Q does not prevent MCM ATPase activity, which might be sufficient to support double hexamer loading. Recent experiments using multiple ATP binding and ATPase-defective MCM mutants in yeast support the model that MCM ATPase activity is necessary for efficient double hexamer loading (<a href=\"#bib7\">Coster et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kang et al., 2014</a>)."

This structural organization is identical to the double hexamer loaded by the wild-type ORC-Cdc6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). As mentioned previously, ATP-\u03b3-S traps a normally transient ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1-MCM (OCCM) intermediate on the DNA with a single MCM hexamer encircling dsDNA but with a small gap in the hexamer at the Mcm2-Mcm5 interface (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bochman and Schwacha, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Costa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Samel et al., 2014</a>). OCCM complexes are not seen with wild-type proteins in ATP, since ATP hydrolysis quickly promotes Cdt1 release to give a \u2018OCM\u2019 intermediate complex and then double hexamer loading (<a href=\"#bib42\">Yardimci and Walter, 2014</a>). Both negative staining-EM and cryo-EM revealed a heterogeneous mixture of OCCM and OCM complexes formed with the Cdc6-E224Q protein in the presence of ATP (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) that were not seen with wild-type Cdc6. These data also suggest that Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis promotes Cdc6 and Cdt1 release from the pre-RC (<a href=\"#bib33\">Speck et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fernandez-Cid et al., 2013</a>) since these OCCM and OCM reaction intermediates accumulate with the Cdc6-E224Q mutant. Taken together, the biochemical data show that the Cdc6-E224Q protein lacks ATPase activity, is defective in Cdc6 release from the pre-RC, but can promote dhMCM loading onto DNA."

Cdc6 is an unstable protein (t1/2 \u2264 5 min) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Piatti et al., 1995</a>) and so we expected that glucose addition (which strongly represses any further Cdc6 expression) would be followed by the disappearance of Cdc6 protein. Cells were synchronized similarly as in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, except after release from the G2/M block in galactose at 37\u00b0C, glucose was added 90 min later to repress the Gal1 promoter (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). When no additional <i>CDC6</i> allele was expressed after the mitotic release, cells arrested with a 1C DNA content for the duration of the experiment and at later time points some cells had a sub-G1 DNA content (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, leftmost time course), indicative of the reductional mitosis seen in the absence of <i>CDC6</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Piatti et al., 1995</a>). When wild-type Cdc6 was expressed, cells progressed into G1 and S-phase quickly between the 90- and 120-min time points. When wild-type Cdc6 expression was repressed by glucose addition at t = 120, Cdc6 protein gradually disappeared (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and cells cycled approximately once more during the experiment. In contrast, if Cdc6-E224Q was continually expressed, cells arrested in G1-phase after release from the G2/M block and remained arrested (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, asterisks). As a control, continual expression of wild-type Cdc6 or the Cdc6-NQ protein from the Gal1 promoter did not cause a G1 arrest (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) as published previously for wild-type Cdc6 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Perkins and Diffley, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Schepers and Diffley, 2001</a>). Remarkably, if Cdc6-E224Q expression was instead repressed 90 min after release (t = 120), the protein was rapidly eliminated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, bottom), and these cells entered a single round of DNA replication as indicated by the substantial S-phase population 30 min after glucose addition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, rightmost time course). This could only occur if a large number of replication origins initiated DNA replication following Cdc6-E224Q removal."

Mutation of charged residues to alanine in the conserved box VIII of AAA+ proteins including the R332 sensor 2 residue also gave no noticeable growth phenotype.

Using purified proteins, Cdc6 ATPase activity is not essential for MCM loading in vitro (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; and [<a href=\"#bib7\">Coster et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kang et al., 2014</a>]) or in vivo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) but is required for initiating DNA replication (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4, 5</a>). Since degradation of the ATPase defective Cdc6-E224Q, Cdc6-E224G and Cdc6-N263A mutant proteins after MCM loading promotes DNA replication (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4, 5</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), Cdc6 ATPase activity is required for Cdc6 release from the pre-RC, that is, an ORC-Cdc6 intermediate complex engaged with MCM (see model in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). So, Cdc6 activity is not required after MCM loading other than for its removal from the helicase-loading complex. Since we did not trap an intermediate complex with ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1 and MCM double hexamer in vitro, we cannot conclude whether MCM hexamers are loaded in tandem, from two separate OCCM structures, or as a double hexamer. Since Cdc6-E224Q is defective for ATP hydrolysis and suppresses ORC ATP hydrolysis in the ORC-Cdc6-DNA context (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), it appears that MCM ATP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) can drive the reaction forward in vitro to give double hexamer formation, albeit less efficiently that with wild-type Cdc6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). However, since blocking Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis in vivo prevents subsequent MCM activation, this suggests that the in vitro reactions do not capture some essential aspect of this reaction. For instance, the dhMCM engaged with ORC-Cdc6-E224Q may be much more stable on origins within chromatin in yeast, which have a small 125-bp nucleosome-free region on average (<a href=\"#bib10\">Eaton et al., 2010</a>)."

All of these intragenic suppressors also mutate the first aspartic acid residue indicating that the presence of this D223 residue blocks Cdc6 activity in vivo when Cdc6 cannot hydrolyze ATP. The NQMD mutation did not restore Cdc6 ATPase activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This simplest explanation for the bypass phenotype is that a conformational change within the Cdc6-NQ mutant compensated for the loss of ATPase activity. This is supported by the fact that the AAMD, AAMA, AAAD mutants grew poorly but the NQMD and NQMN mutants, which have quite different substitutions at the \u2018DE\u2019 residues, grew very robustly at all temperatures (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It is well established that ATP hydrolysis by AAA+ family members leads to conformational changes within these proteins, which drive the reactions forward, and this conformational change is communicated by residues in close proximity to the ATP/ADP binding pocket (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hanson and Whiteheart, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wendler et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Duderstadt and Berger, 2013</a>)."

We suggest this is not its primary role in vivo since blocking a quality control function for the Cdc6 ATPase (i.e., ejecting incompletely assembled MCM hexamers or MCM-Cdt1 heptamers that bind the ORC-Cdc6 loader before loading onto dsDNA) should not give rise to a lethal phenotype. The hexameric replicative helicase structure and loading mechanisms have been honed over a long evolutionary history to be highly efficient (<a href=\"#bib13\">Forsburg, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bae et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Slaymaker and Chen, 2012</a>) and probably very few errors occur in vivo. Our data strongly suggest that the essential role of the Cdc6 ATPase is to disengage Cdc6 from the pre-RC after MCM is loaded. Interestingly, this role of the Cdc6 ATPase in initiating DNA replication is similar to bacterial helicase loaders: the AAA+ <i>Escherichia coli</i> helicase loader DnaC does not require ATP hydrolysis to load the hexameric DnaB helicase at <i>oriC</i>\u2014but DnaC ATP hydrolysis leads to DnaC disassembly and release from a DnaC\u2013DnaB complex that actually inhibits DnaB helicase activity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Davey et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</a>). Our data therefore reveal a broad conservation of replicative helicase loading mechanisms across kingdoms, which can hopefully be further elucidated by crystallographic or other biophysical methods using wild type and mutant helicase loading complexes."

To get more particles in each image, we added a thin continuous carbon on top of the commercially available lacey carbon grids (SPI #3830C-MB). We coated a very thin carbon layer on freshly cleaved mica using an Edwards Auto 306 evaporator, floated the thin carbon film off the mica surface onto water surface, then lowered the water level to deposit the carbon film on lacey grids. We glow-discharged the dried grids in a PELCO easiGlow before applying 3 \u00b5l sample onto the surface. After blotting for 5 s, we plunged the grid into liquefied ethane to get vitrified sample in the FEI Vitrobot, keeping the sample chamber temperature at 11\u00b0C, relative humidity 90%, and offset position of \u22121 mm. For negative stain EM grids preparation, we first glow-discharged the carbon-coated EM grids in PELCO easiGlow, applied 3 \u00b5l sample, blotted the grids with a piece of filter paper, applied one drop of 1% uranyl acetate solution, waited about 30 s, blotted and applied another drop of stain solution, waited about 1 min, then blotted to nearly but not completely dry, and left a thin layer of stain solution on the grid for air drying."
