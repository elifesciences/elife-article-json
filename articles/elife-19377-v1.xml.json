A traditional, centuries-old rice agro-system of the Yuanyang terraces was used as a model to show that virulence effectors of the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzaeh</i> play a key role in its specialization on locally grown indica or japonica local rice subspecies. Our results have indicated that major differences in several components of basal immunity and effector-triggered immunity of the japonica and indica rice varieties are associated with specialization of <i>M. oryzae</i>. These differences thus play a key role in determining <i>M. oryzae</i> host specificity and may limit the spread of the pathogen within the Yuanyang agro-system. Specifically, the AVR-Pia effector has been identified as a possible determinant of the specialization of <i>M. oryzae</i> to local japonica rice."

A traditional, centuries-old rice agro-system of the Yuanyang terraces was used as a model to show that virulence effectors of the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzaeh</i> play a key role in its specialization on locally grown indica or japonica local rice subspecies. Our results have indicated that major differences in several components of basal immunity and effector-triggered immunity of the japonica and indica rice varieties are associated with specialization of <i>M. oryzae</i>. These differences thus play a key role in determining <i>M. oryzae</i> host specificity and may limit the spread of the pathogen within the Yuanyang agro-system. Specifically, the AVR-Pia effector has been identified as a possible determinant of the specialization of <i>M. oryzae</i> to local japonica rice."

For centuries, farmers and plant breeders have selected for these resistance genes when trying to breed crops that are more resistant to disease. However, over time, disease-causing microbes have lost effectors, which means that several resistance genes have rapidly become ineffective."

Some of these varieties had a strong first line of defense and few resistance genes, while others relied much more on resistance genes to protect themselves again the rice blast fungus. Liao, Huang et al. found that growing rice varieties with such different immune systems forces some of the rice blast fungi to accumulate effector proteins to combat the first line of defense, whereas other fungi had to get rid of these effectors to avoid being recognized by the major resistance genes. These two forces led to the evolution of two specialized populations of fungi that can infect specific rice varieties but not others. This means that the fungi cannot spread in the landscape, and so the fields of rice become resistant as a whole."

                        "text": "Understanding the mechanisms determining host range of plant pathogens is crucial for disease management strategies, phytosanitary regulations and policies. The recurrent emergence of new pathogen lineages specialized to novel plant species or newly bred resistant varieties is a major limitation to agricultural production, and there is tremendous interest in developing sustainable strategies to prevent pathogen emergence and spread (<a href=\"#bib30\">McDonald, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Giraud et al., 2010</a>). Finding durable methods of controlling the host range of pathogens requires the understanding of the molecular and physiological determinants of pathogen variation in fitness across space and hosts (<a href=\"#bib43\">Williams, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barrett et al., 2008</a>). Before the advent of molecular genetic methods, classical studies in plant pathology have documented patterns of pathogen fitness on different hosts, including pathogenicity (the capacity to infect) and virulence (the quantity of symptoms) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Johnson, 1961</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nadler, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brown, 1994</a>). Variations in pathogen fitness have been repeatedly investigated for numerous agricultural pathosystems using controlled cross-inoculation experiments or inoculation on series of differential hosts. Numerous studies have reported evidence for pathogen local adaptation, where local pathogens have a greater average fitness on their local hosts than immigrants (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kaltz and Shykoff, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Laine and Barr\u00e8s, 2013</a>). Higher pathogen fitness on hosts living in the same habitat is consistent with evolutionary theory, which predicts that parasites should be ahead of their hosts in the co-evolutionary race due to their higher mutation rates, shorter generation times and huge populations sizes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gandon and Michalakis, 2002</a>). Trade-offs among pathogen fitness traits (e.g. between pathogenicity and transmission success rate) are also frequently invoked in theoretical models to explain the maintenance of variation in pathogenicity and resistance (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown and Tellier, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Laine and Tellier, 2008</a>). However, although it is important to elucidate the origin and maintenance of variations in pathogen fitness on different hosts for developing durable means of controlling disease, most current understanding is still largely based on theoretical predictions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown and Tellier, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Laine and Tellier, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Schulze-Lefert and Panstruga, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Thrall et al., 2015</a>). Thus there is a lack of studies investigating the molecular or physiological bases of variation in pathogen fitness across pathogen populations, especially in fungi (<a href=\"#bib33\">Poppe et al., 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "Our current knowledge about the genetic basis of fungal pathogen specialization determining host range is mainly based on comparative genomics and functional analyses of candidate genes. These studies revealed the pivotal role of effector proteins that are secreted during infection and target cellular processes of the host to promote infection. In plant pathogenic fungi, the most prominent class of effectors are small secreted proteins. They are believed to be mostly involved in the suppression of host immunity and in particular so-called pattern-triggered immunity activated by conserved microbial molecular patterns, such as fungal cell wall components (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lo Presti et al., 2015</a>). Comparative genomics have revealed distinct repertoires of effectors between related pathogens specialized on different hosts. This suggests that variation in the composition of pathogen effector repertoires contributes to variation in pathogen fitness on different hosts (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib36\">Schulze-Lefert and Panstruga, 2011</a>]). In the case of <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> for instance, pathogenicity toward rice was correlated with the presence of certain effectors (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chiapello et al., 2015</a>). The role of variation in pathogen effector repertoires in pathogen specialization is supported by the fact that dispensable, lineage-specific chromosomes containing effectors appear to control adaptation to hosts in a number of fungal plant pathogens (e.g. [<a href=\"#bib29\">Ma et al., 2010</a>]). In the rice blast fungus <i>M. oryzae,</i> the role of effectors in specialization is supported by circumstantial evidence stemming from the comparisons of isolates specialized to rice and Setaria millet. While the effector-coding gene <i>AVR1-CO39</i> was absent from rice-infecting isolates, transgenic expression of <i>AVR1-CO39</i> rendered rice isolates non-pathogenic onto rice carrying the appropriate immune receptor (<a href=\"#bib11\">Couch et al., 2005</a>). Similar situations have been reported for the <i>PWL2</i> gene that prevents pathogenicity on weeping lovegrass (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sweigard et al., 1995</a>) and the <i>Pwt3</i> and <i>Pwt4</i> genes that prevent pathogenicity on wheat (<a href=\"#bib39\">Takabayashi et al., 2002</a>). Thus, whereas the role of effectors in pathogenicity has been demonstrated in several cases (for review [<a href=\"#bib2\">Asai and Shirasu, 2015</a>]), their role in variations in host range among pathogen populations remains largely unknown. In some cases, certain effectors can be recognized by plant immune receptors (often called resistance proteins), leading to the activation of the so-called effector-triggered immunity. The effectors revealed by their activity rendering some isolates non-pathogenic (\u2018avirulent\u2019) on some hosts represent a sub-category later called <i>Avr</i>-effectors (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jones and Dangl, 2006</a>). The strong and specific resistance level conferred by effector-triggered immunity contrasts with basal immunity which is weak and not specific and relies on a combination of different mechanisms like constitutive expression of defense genes and pattern-triggered immunity (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lo Presti et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Vergne et al., 2010</a>). The respective roles of effector-triggered and basal immune responses in pathogen host range variations have yet to be investigated."

Four major lineages of <i>M. oryzae</i> causing rice blast can be distinguished on a worldwide scale (<a href=\"#bib35\">Saleh et al., 2014</a>). The rice - <i>M. oryzae</i> pathosystem is particularly well-suited for studying specialization to the host since a large number of effectors and resistance (<i>Pi</i>) genes coding for immune receptors have been cloned and basal immunity is now well-understood (<a href=\"#bib3\">Azizi et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, large-scale cross-inoculation experiments of a collection of rice varieties with a collection of rice blast samples representing the worldwide diversity revealed patterns of pathogen fitness that suggest the existence of specialization to hosts in this pathosystem (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gallet et al., 2016</a>). Strains originating from japonica rice infected most japonica varieties but could not infect indica varieties whereas strains derived from indica rice infected indica and japonica varieties in controlled conditions. Inoculation onto varieties containing different <i>Pi</i> resistance genes suggested an important role of these genes in the observed patterns of pathogenicity. This is due to the fact that strains originating from japonica hosts were able to overcome less resistance genes than strains originating from indica hosts. However, conclusions regarding the determinants of host range and pathogen specialization were hindered by the fact that the plants and fungal isolates tested had not been collected at the same sites, and were not actively involved in co-evolutionary interactions."

First, we showed that pathogen populations are specialized to indica and japonica rice varieties. Next, we investigated the role of plant immunity in shaping variations in pathogen fitness and the contribution of effectors to this pattern. We discovered that specialization of <i>M. oryzae</i> isolates to japonica and indica varieties grown in Yuanyang is correlated with, respectively, the deployment of a large number of <i>Avr</i>-effectors in japonica-borne isolates (i.e. effectors triggering complete resistance in some plant genotypes) and a large depletion of Avr-effectors in indica-borne isolates. These contrasting effector repertoires mirror the significant immunity differences between japonica and indica local varieties. We provide further evidence that the <i>AVR-Pia</i> effector is possibly a key player in the pattern of specialization to indica or japonica rice varieties observed."

Lesions caused by JB isolates had a drastically reduced brown halo, a phenotype that is associated with resistance and correlated with the production of reactive oxygen species (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hayashi et al., 2016</a>). This indicated that JB isolates may have the capacity to inhibit this important component of basal immunity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jones and Dangl, 2006</a>). This also suggested that IB isolates may face high basal immunity in Yuanyang japonica varieties. To test this hypothesis, we first evaluated basal immunity conferring partial protection in the absence of major resistance genes and relying on a combination of several different molecular processes such as preformed defense (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vergne et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Delteil et al., 2012</a>) and pattern-triggered immunity (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lo Presti et al., 2015</a>). We inoculated four broadly infecting isolates that harbor few <i>Avr</i>-effectors (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gallet et al., 2016</a>) to evaluate resistance under conditions that minimize effector-triggered immunity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vergne et al., 2010</a>). This analysis showed that japonica varieties from Yuanyang are more resistant than indica varieties (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), comparable to the level observed in Nipponbare, which is renowned for its elevated basal immunity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vergne et al., 2010</a>)."

When measuring the expression of 16 <i>PR</i> genes and 12 genes involved in resistance signaling that are frequently co-regulated with defense genes (see list in <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), more than half of the genes (16/28) and more than two thirds of the <i>PR</i> genes (11/16) showed higher constitutive expression in Yuanyang varieties compared to Nipponbare renowned for its elevated constitutive defense (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vergne et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), with the Huang Pi Nuo variety showing the strongest constitutive expression of defense-related markers (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

Indeed a large effector complement may have the capacity to dampen basal immunity down to the low level found in immune-deficient plants. We thus tested the capacity of Yuanyang isolates with different numbers of <i>Avr</i>-effectors to infect the <i>cebip</i> mutant, defective in mounting chitin pattern-triggered immunity and showing reduced basal immunity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Delteil et al., 2012</a>). As previously described, the immuno-depressed plants were less resistant than wild type plants. However, this reduced resistance was only observed with isolates containing a small <i>Avr</i>-effector complement but not with JB isolates containing a large <i>Avr</i>-effector complement (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results indicate that basal immunity has a strong negative impact on the virulence of isolates harboring a relatively limited set of <i>Avr</i>-effectors but not of isolates with a large <i>Avr</i>-effector arsenal. Overall, our findings hence validate the hypothesis that the <i>Avr</i>-effector complement in JB isolates is critical for dampening the basal immunity of Yuanyang japonica rice."

Since numerous effectors in JB isolates could have redundant functions, we reasoned that deleting <i>AVR-Pia</i> or <i>AVR-Pii</i> from these isolates may not strongly affect virulence. We therefore decided to test the role of these effectors by transferring them into the AVR depleted strain Guy11 (26). Only <i>AVR-Pia</i> showed significant effects (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) that were further confirmed by comparing three independent transgenic strains expressing <i>AVR-Pia</i> and three independent strains containing the empty vector on several japonica rice varieties (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Two key parameters of virulence, the percentage of susceptible lesions and the surface of individual lesions, were significantly higher for the <i>AVR-Pia</i> transgenic strain and the effect of <i>AVR-Pia</i> was most significant on the Yuanyang variety Huang Pi Nuo. This indicates that <i>AVR-Pia</i> makes a significant contribution to the virulence of <i>M. oryzae</i> on this particular japonica variety, potentially by interfering with cellular host processes important for infection. However, <i>AVR-Pia</i> alone was not sufficient to increase virulence on the Nuo Gu japonica variety, as expected due to the strong inducibility of pattern-triggered immunity in this variety (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

Most notably, previous studies suffered from the use of fungal isolates and plant genotypes that were un-paired, i.e. not obtained from the same plant or area. This therefore did not allow the clear detection of the differential adaptation of pathogens to their local hosts. In our study, we used a large collection of isolates (&gt;200) and their paired rice hosts to investigate the specialization of <i>M. oryzae</i> to the host genotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The population of <i>M. oryzae</i> in the traditional agro-system of the Yuanyang terraces is highly diverse and structured (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a>). In particular, there is strong genetic differentiation between isolates from rice host plants belonging to the indica or the japonica subspecies (IB and JB isolates respectively). Interestingly, IB isolates that were rarely sampled on japonica rice in the field were pathogenic on japonica varieties from the Yuanyang terraces or other origins in controlled conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, they showed reduced virulence on japonica rice that was only detected when quantitative differences were recorded in infection experiments under controlled conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This reduced virulence of the IB isolates may explain their exclusion from japonica rice in the Yuanyang agro-system. Recently, it has been shown that isolates of <i>Pyrenophora teres</i> f. <i>teres</i> cause\u00a0~9% more lesions on their local barley hosts than immigrants (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rau et al., 2015</a>), a value similar to what we observe (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Contrasting with the pattern uncovered for IB isolates, JB isolates were non-pathogenic on indica varieties under controlled conditions and are largely excluded from such hosts in the field. Therefore, we found clear evidence that, in the Yuanyang terraces, <i>M. oryzae</i> isolates are specialized to indica or japonica hosts and that fitness differences on these hosts correlates with genetic differentiation, indicating that there is local, host-driven adaptation in the rice-<i>M. oryzae</i> pathosystem. The situation observed in the Yuanyang agro-system is reminiscent of what has been described for several natural ecosystems (for review [<a href=\"#bib16\">Greischar and Koskella, 2007</a>]) and represents one of the very few examples known thus far of specialization of a pathogen to its host in an agro-system."

We demonstrated that the Japonica varieties from the Yuanyang terraces harbor an elevated basal immunity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 3</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3s7\">7</a>) but a low content in major resistance (<i>Pi)</i> genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The larger effector repertoire of Japonica-infecting isolates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) could enable them to overcome the elevated basal immunity in Yuanyang japonica varieties (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In parallel, the relatively larger effector complement of JB isolates would lead to a strong fitness cost on Yuanyang indica varieties (e.g. <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) that contain a large set of <i>Pi</i> genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), with many effectors acting as <i>Avr</i>-effectors (i.e. effectors triggering complete resistance in plant genotypes carrying a <i>Pi</i> genes that recognize them). By contrast, indica-infecting isolates lack multiple effectors, including <i>Avr-</i>effectors, and are therefore able to escape detection by matching <i>Pi</i> genes in indica varieties. However, the lack of these effectors induces a strong fitness cost on japonica varieties (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) that have a higher level of basal immunity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This model explains why japonica rice varieties, which represent only 2% of the rice grown in Yuanyang, are almost exclusively infected by the particular type of JB isolates and not by the IB isolates that are very much dominating in terms of population size and are able, at least under controlled conditions, to infect japonica rice. In their description of a unifying concept for non-host resistance, host range and pathogen speciation, Schulze-Lefert and Panstruga (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schulze-Lefert and Panstruga, 2011</a>) proposed that pattern-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity both contribute to non-host resistance, while effector-triggered immunity was proposed to mainly drive host range, i.e. the range of host genotypes that can be infected within a given host species. Our results suggest that several components of basal immunity (including pattern-triggered immunity and constitutive expression of defense) are also important determinants of host range in an agronomical context. Basal immunity in japonica leads to the accumulation of effectors that are detrimental on indica since varieties of this latter rice subspecies display strong effector-triggered immunity thanks to their extended repertoires of immune receptors for <i>Avr</i>-effectors."

                                "text": "Effectors, fitness cost and differential adaptation are linked in different theoretical models <a href=\"#bib15\">Giraud et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Laine and Barr\u00e8s, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barrett et al., 2009</a>] and references therein). On the one hand, positive and negative fitness costs of effectors were demonstrated in rare field studies involving the fungus <i>Leptosphaeria maculans</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">2010</a>) or the bacterium <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Vera Cruz et al., 2000</a>). Under controlled conditions, a reduced number of \u2018avirulence\u2019 activities had a significant negative impact on fitness as in the case of <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> infecting potato (<a href=\"#bib31\">Montarry et al., 2010</a>). This is similar to what we observe with IB isolates that lost many <i>Avr</i>-effectors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), probably to become infectious on indica varieties. At the same time, this loss of <i>Avr</i>-effectors may negatively impact fitness on japonica rice on which larger repertoires of <i>Avr</i>-effectors are required (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). On the other hand, fitness cost and specialization have been observed in many instances (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib24\">Laine and Barr\u00e8s, 2013</a>]). By contrast, there are yet only few cases demonstrating the relationship between effector suites and specialization in plants or in animals. In plants, a major support for the relationship between effector content and specialization to host plants comes from experiments where the transfer of an entire mobile chromosome harboring effectors could convert a non-pathogenic strain of <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> into a pathogen of tomato (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ma et al., 2010</a>). In animals, a convincing example was provided in the case of the transfer of an effector from <i>Coxiella burnetii</i> that could extend host cell range of <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">L\u00fchrmann et al., 2010</a>). Our data suggest that the JB isolates have a characteristic effector suite (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) that is required for specialization to japonica rice in Yuanyang (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Our data also suggests that, amongst them, <i>AVR-Pia</i> is a major determinant of specialization to either indica or japonica rice subspecies found in the Yuanyang terraces. Indeed we show that (i) the sole presence of <i>AVR-Pia</i> increases several fitness parameters (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) on the japonica rice Huang Pi Nuo that has elevated basal immunity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and (ii) that <i>AVR-Pia</i> is present in almost all JB isolates and absent from IB isolates (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Additional experiments, such as mutating <i>AVR-Pia</i> in JB isolates, could provide further insights into the role of this gene in differential adaptation to indica and japonica varieties. To our knowledge this is also the first report in <i>M. oryzae</i> of an <i>Avr</i>-effector demonstrated to confer increased fitness. Interestingly, despite the gain of fitness provided by <i>AVR-Pia</i> on some japonica variety, this gene was lost at a high frequency in <i>M. oryzae</i> strains at the worldwide level (<a href=\"#bib44\">Yoshida et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cesari et al., 2013</a>). This suggests that the <i>Pia</i> resistance gene was in the past widely distributed and therefore counter-selected strains harboring <i>AVR-Pia</i>. The findings reported here allowed us to propose a model describing the molecular underpinnings of the specialization of <i>M. oryzae</i> to japonica and indica varieties in Yuanyang. Our work will form the basis of testable hypotheses to determine whether the molecular mechanisms described by our model represent fundamental features of the specialization of <i>M. oryzae</i> to indica and japonica rice subspecies and in other pathosystems."

In their pioneer work showing that mixtures can produce resistance, Zhu et al. (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhu et al., 2000</a>) reported a field situation where inter-cropping rice varieties dramatically reduced blast severity levels. Quite interestingly, this work involved a japonica variety (including Huang Pi Nuo, a.k.a Huang Ke Nuo) and two modern hybrid indica varieties (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zhu et al., 2004</a>). We propose that part of the observed reduction of disease in this seminal work could be due to mechanisms similar to the ones uncovered in the Yuanyang terraces. The different types of resistance factors deployed may have been exposed to specialized pathogen populations, whose reduced virulence on their non-native alternate hosts would have reduced the global disease burden."

The originality of this study is that they studied paired fungus/cultivars. They surprisingly discovered a highly structured pathogen population and went to investigate why IB (Indica-borne) isolates do not infect japonica cultivars. They propose that japonica cultivars have fewer <i>Pi</i> resistance genes and more elevated levels of basal resistance. Pathogen strains that carry fewer effectors are less competitive on japonica cultivars since they cannot overcome the higher levels of basal resistance. They ascribed the effect to primarily one effector <i>Avr-Pia</i>, which can enhance virulence levels. The work is original and important, but some of the key findings are not fully supported by data."
