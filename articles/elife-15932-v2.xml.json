                    "text": "Type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) are widely expressed in the vertebrate retina, but the role of endocannabinoids in vision is not fully understood. Here, we identified a novel mechanism underlying a CB1R-mediated increase in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) intrinsic excitability acting through AMPK-dependent inhibition of NKCC1 activity. Clomeleon imaging and patch clamp recordings revealed that inhibition of NKCC1 downstream of CB1R activation reduces intracellular Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> levels in RGCs, hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential. We confirmed that such hyperpolarization enhances RGC action potential firing in response to subsequent depolarization, consistent with the increased intrinsic excitability of RGCs observed with CB1R activation. Using a dot avoidance assay in freely swimming <i>Xenopus</i> tadpoles, we demonstrate that CB1R activation markedly improves visual contrast sensitivity under low-light conditions. These results highlight a role for endocannabinoids in vision and present a novel mechanism for cannabinoid modulation of neuronal activity through Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> regulation."

Here, we identified a novel mechanism underlying a CB1R-mediated increase in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) intrinsic excitability acting through AMPK-dependent inhibition of NKCC1 activity. Clomeleon imaging and patch clamp recordings revealed that inhibition of NKCC1 downstream of CB1R activation reduces intracellular Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> levels in RGCs, hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential. We confirmed that such hyperpolarization enhances RGC action potential firing in response to subsequent depolarization, consistent with the increased intrinsic excitability of RGCs observed with CB1R activation. Using a dot avoidance assay in freely swimming <i>Xenopus</i> tadpoles, we demonstrate that CB1R activation markedly improves visual contrast sensitivity under low-light conditions. These results highlight a role for endocannabinoids in vision and present a novel mechanism for cannabinoid modulation of neuronal activity through Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> regulation."

In the retina, high levels of type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R), as well as the eCB production and degradation machinery, have been found in all vertebrate models tested, and within nearly all retinal cell types throughout development and adulthood (<a href=\"#bib59\">Straiker et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yazulla, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zabouri et al., 2011</a>). Although eCB modulation of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> conductances, typically resulting in the downregulation of neurotransmitter release, has been demonstrated at multiple stages of retinal processing from photoreceptors to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fan and Yazulla, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lalonde et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Middleton and Protti, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yazulla et al., 2000</a>), these observations have not been directly linked to specific perceptual outcomes. On the other hand, cannabis consumption in humans has been reported to positively modulate contrast discrimination (<a href=\"#bib53\">Russo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">West, 1991</a>). Given the overall importance of eCB signaling in modulating neuronal activity, we set out to test whether retinal eCB signaling impacts visual function, and if so, by what modes of action."

Exploiting the strengths of this model, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which eCB signaling increases the intrinsic excitability of RGCs through AMPK-dependent inhibition of the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> co-transporter 1 (NKCC1). NKCC1 inhibition causes a reduction in intracellular Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> levels, which enhances tonic glycinergic currents and hyperpolarizes the resting membrane potential in RGCs. We show that membrane hyperpolarization actually makes RGCs fire more spikes in response to subsequent stimulation. Accordingly, we found that activation of CB1Rs produces a marked reduction of the contrast threshold needed to trigger a visually evoked escape behavior by tadpoles under dim light conditions, consistent with enhanced visual perception."

We examined the retinae of <i>Xenopus</i> tadpoles, and found intense CB1R immunoreactivity (CB1R-IR) in the outer and inner plexiform layers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a,b</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with reports in other species (<a href=\"#bib47\">Middleton and Protti, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yazulla et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zabouri et al., 2011</a>).

Using Isl2b:GFP transgenic frogs, in which expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the retina is restricted to RGCs, we found CB1R-IR associated with GFP-positive RGCs in histological sections (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>) and in overnight dissociated retinal cultures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). These data show that CB1R-IR is present at multiple levels, including in RGCs within the retina of the tadpole, consistent with a role for the eCB system in early visual processing."

To assess whether endogenous cannabinoids produced by the retina can generate this effect in the absence of exogenous ligand, we applied URB597 (2 \u00b5M), a selective inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the enzyme that degrades the eCB anandamide (AEA). URB597 treatment caused elevated spiking rates in response to light-ON (before: 22.8 \u00b1 5.3\u2009Hz, after: 31.3 \u00b1 6.6\u2009Hz, n = 10, p=0.049) and light-OFF stimulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1c,f</a>; before: 51.0 \u00b1 7.0\u2009Hz; after: 61.7 \u00b1 10.3\u2009Hz, n = 10, p=0.031), suggesting that AEA synthesized in the retina is able to modulate visual responses."

We first performed electroretinogram (ERG) recordings in the isolated eye preparation to test if WIN 55,212-2 application modulated responses in the outer layers of the retina (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>). ERGs revealed visual responses of various non-spiking cell types in the outer retina, including photoreceptors (a-wave), ON-center bipolar cells (b-wave) and OFF-center bipolar cells (d-wave). Visual stimulation produced stable ERG responses that were generally more robust for light-OFF stimuli, consistent with previous reports in the <i>Xenopus</i> visual system (<a href=\"#bib23\">Engert et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zhang et al., 2000</a>).

Similarly, CB1Rs at inhibitory amacrine presynaptic contacts could alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to modulate the\u00a0release of GABA or glycine. Such effects would go undetected in ERG recordings but would alter the spiking output of RGCs. To test these possibilities, we used retinal electroporation to express the genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter GCaMP6s in bipolar and amacrine cells to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in vivo at their presynaptic terminals in response to light flashes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a\u2013i</a>).

Previous studies have identified the regulation of [Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]<sub>i\u00a0</sub>levels by NKCC1 activity as a mechanism mediating inhibitory plasticity in immature hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balena and Woodin, 2008</a>). NKCC1 and KCC2 are co-expressed in RGCs in fish retina (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dmitriev et al., 2007</a>), and we were able to detect both mRNAs in stage 45 <i>Xenopus</i> retina (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4i</a>). Perfusion of the selective NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide (10 \u00b5M) alone was sufficient to increase the firing rates of RGCs in response to light, mimicking the effect of CB1R activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g</a>, n = 10, p=0.025). Subsequent addition of WIN 55,212-2 in the presence of bumetanide produced no additional increase in RGC firing rate (n = 10, p=0.224). Furthermore, WIN 55,212-2 application (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a>, n = 9, p=0.012) occluded the increase in RGC firing rate produced by adding bumetanide (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a>, n = 9, p=0.224 vs. WIN alone).

In mammals, the WNK-activated Sterile-20 (Ste20)-related Proline/Alanine-rich Kinase (SPAK) and Oxidative Stress-Response Kinase 1 (OSR1) have been shown to stimulate human NKCC1 through phosphorylation at T203, T207, T212 and T217 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Darman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Richardson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Vitari et al., 2006</a>), whereas AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) inhibits NKCC1 by phosphorylation at S77\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Fraser et al., 2014</a>). We examined the involvement of these regulatory molecules by performing western blotting on retina homogenates from animals treated with WIN 55,212-2. WIN 55,212-2 application produced a striking increase in the levels of phosphorylated SPAK/OSR1, indicating its activation downstream of the CB1R (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4j,k</a>); however, this was not accompanied by an increase in phospho-NKCC1<sup>T212/T217</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1i</a>). Thus, SPAK/OSR1, although activated, appears not to phosphorylate and activate NKCC1 under these conditions. Moreover, our physiology data would have predicted <i>decreased</i> NKCC1 activity. We therefore wondered whether AMPK activation might be suppressing NKCC1 function. Because no phospho-specific antibody against the AMPK site S77 on NKCC1 is available, we instead tested this hypothesis functionally by using the selective AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin. We found that dorsomorphin (10 \u00b5M) reversed the effects of WIN 55,212-2, reducing RGCs spiking rate in response to light-OFF flashes (before: 37.5 \u00b1 6.3\u2009Hz, after: 22.9 \u00b1 2.6\u2009Hz, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4l</a>, n = 10, p=0.0095, paired t-test). These results indicate that CB1R signaling inhibits NKCC1 through the activation of AMPK."

Clomeleon-expressing RGCs, bipolar cells, amacrine cells and M\u00fcller glia were identified based on morphology and location.

We tested this prediction by performing gramicidin-perforated patch recordings on dissociated cultured RGCs. To identify RGCs in dissociated retinal cultures, we used Isl2b:EGFP transgenic tadpoles that express GFP in RGCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6g</a>). Application of WIN 55,212-2 significantly hyperpolarized RGCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6h</a>, uncorrected for liquid junction potential; n = 6, p=0.004, paired t-test). This shift was prevented in the presence of AM-251 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6i</a>, n = 6, p=0.14, one-way RM ANOVA). This experiment not only confirms that CB1R activation can hyperpolarize RGCs, but the fact that it does so in isolated cells, shows that this effect does not depend on cannabinoid actions on other cells in the retina."

RGCs are known to decrease their excitability following a period of depolarization and firing through the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels as a way of extending their dynamic range\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib39\">Kim and Rieke, 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Weick and Demb, 2011</a>). Hyperpolarization, by facilitating recovery from inactivation, may therefore increase the intrinsic excitability of RGCs. We examined whether a brief hyperpolarizing pre-pulse could indeed enhance the excitability of Xenopus RGCs\u00a0in vivo. During whole-cell current-clamp recordings from RGCs, a pre-pulse of 100 ms hyperpolarizing or depolarizing current (range: \u2212100 to +80\u2009pA) was injected, and 25 ms later a 100 ms depolarizing test pulse (200\u2009pA) was applied (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6j</a>). The number of spikes evoked by the test pulse was substantially elevated following hyperpolarizing pre-pulses, whereas it decreased after depolarizing pre-pulses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6k</a>). The 25 ms interval between pre-pulse and test pulse facilitated spike counting, but the effect was also evident in experiments where the test pulse followed immediately after the pre-pulse."

We therefore measured the extracellular RGC response to stimulation of a small central visual subfield (8\u00a0degrees) by presenting a 1 s light-OFF test stimulus every 10 s, and attempted to modulate the response by introducing a sustained increase in the luminance of the far surrounding peripheral field for 100 s as the conditioning stimulation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a,b</a>).

The difference in the peak amplitude before and after WIN 55,212-2 application could no longer be detected (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d</a>, 100 \u00b1 11% baseline, n = 7, p=0.999). This indicates that the cannabinoid-mediated enhancement of retinotectal EPSC amplitude is due to increased retinal excitability and the resulting recruitment of more RGCs when stimulating in the eye, rather than to changes at the retinotectal synapses or in properties of the neurons within the optic tectum (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1c\u2013h</a>)."

                                "text": "Taken together, these data suggest a model in which activation of CB1Rs on RGCs should enhance their excitability enough to recruit RGCs to fire action potentials in response to visual stimulation of subfields that were previously sub-threshold. This should manifest as an enlargement of input receptive field (RF) sizes in tectal neurons, which receive convergent inputs from many RGCs. To test this prediction, we examined whether RFs of tectal neurons were expanded by WIN 55,212-2 treatment. Immediately after establishing stable in vivoamphotericin-perforated patches onto tectal neurons in intact tadpoles, the objective of the electrophysiology microscope was reoriented to project a 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07 grid of rectangular subfields directly onto the photoreceptor layer of the eye contralateral to the cell being recorded. Each subfield was then repeatedly stimulated in random sequence with a light-OFF stimulus while recording compound synaptic currents from tectal cells held at \u221260 mV (<a href=\"#bib23\">Engert et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tao and Poo, 2005</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8e</a>). An example of one RF mapping experiment is shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8f\u2013g</a>. WIN 55,212-2 application produced a significant increase in tectal RF size (127.6 \u00b1 9.4% baseline, n = 5, p=0.042, one-sample t-test) and in the total charge evoked (140.3 \u00b1 14.2% baseline, n = 5, p=0.047) across all responsive subfields (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8f\u2013h</a>). These results show that activation of retinal CB1Rs increases the size and strength of tectal RFs, most likely through the recruitment of responses from initially subthreshold RGC inputs."

We created video-tracking software to automatically track tadpole and dot movements and quantify escape responses over a range of brightness and contrast conditions in control or drug-containing media. Videos of up to 8 animals at a time, swimming in a Petri dish positioned over a computer monitor were collected for each trial (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8i,j</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). A potential dot avoidance event was counted whenever a moving dot came within 5\u2009mm of a tadpole. A successful avoidance event was logged whenever swimming velocity changed by at least 24\u2009mm s<sup>\u22121</sup> within 0.25\u2009s of initial encounter. During an initial 3\u2009min pre-test period, a uniform field was displayed to calculate false-positive response probabilities for the tadpoles by measuring escape 'responses' to 'invisible dots' presented by the software as isoluminant to background, and during the subsequent 5\u2009min test period, dots (4\u2009mm diameter) with lower luminance than the background, moving in random directions were displayed on the monitor while the software tracked each tadpole for escape responses (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8j</a>). Importantly, WIN 55,212-2 treatment did not impair basic motor coordination. The mean velocities of swimming tadpoles when not interacting with dots was indistinguishable between control and WIN 55,212-2-treated groups, indicating that the drug did not alter the rhythms or coordination underlying swimming behavior (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8k</a>, n = 24, p=0.491, two-way RM ANOVA with Holm-Sidak posttest). However, we did find that WIN 55,212-2-treated tadpoles swam significantly faster when executing escape behaviors (n = 24, p&lt;0.001), highlighting the caveat that higher-order circuitry was likely also affected by the drug treatments."

When dark dots were presented under photopic conditions (overall luminance of the field = 190\u2009cd m<sup>\u22122</sup>), control tadpoles and WIN 55,212-2-treated tadpoles did not differ in their avoidance response rates to dots having a luminance 190, 150 and 90\u2009cd m<sup>\u22122</sup> darker than background. All elicited significantly more escapes than the false-positive rate measured during the pre-test periods. The faintest dots, which differed from background by only 16\u2009cd m<sup>\u22122</sup>, did not elicit a significant reaction (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8l</a>). Under mesopic light conditions (overall luminance of the field = 0.65\u2009cd m<sup>\u22122</sup>) control animals responded only at chance levels to all stimuli tested. Remarkably, WIN 55,212-2-treated tadpoles successfully avoided a significant fraction of dots with luminance differences to the background as small as 0.22\u2009cd m<sup>\u22122</sup> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8m</a>, n = 24, p=0.003, <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">3</a>).

The effects of URB597 were abolished by the CB1R inverse agonist AM-251 (5 \u00b5M), indicating that the drug was indeed acting by elevating endogenous cannabinoids (n = 24, p&lt;0.001)."

Although our observation of increased escape velocities suggests that the effects of WIN 55,212-2 were not limited to the retina, the finding that drug-treated tadpoles exhibited superior detection of mesopic, but not photopic, visual stimuli, strongly argues for a retinal site of action. It is therefore highly likely that the enhanced excitability of RGCs by CB1R activation which we first report here, also contributes to this remarkable improvement in the visual detection of dim objects."

In neurons, Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> levels are primarily controlled by the interplay of the inward NKCC1 and outward KCC2 cation-Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> co-transporters, which are modulated by phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Darman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">de Los Heros et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Delpire and Austin, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Garz\u00f3n-Muvdi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rinehart et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Song et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wenz et al., 2009</a>). Activation of human NKCC1 requires phosphorylation at T217 by SPAK family members downstream of WNK1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Darman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Vitari et al., 2006</a>). It had previously been reported that AMPK activation can result in the inhibition of human NKCC1 through phosphorylation at S77, as well as suppression of T217 phosphorylation by SPAK (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fraser et al., 2014</a>). In our study, we have provided evidence that CB1R-mediated down-regulation of [Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. in RGCs is dependent upon the AMPK pathway."

Although tonic glycinergic inhibition has been well studied in the spinal cord and hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib69\">Xu and Gong, 2010</a>), our study is one of the first to suggest a role for tonic inhibition by strychnine-sensitive GlyRs in the retina. We also found evidence from calcium imaging of bipolar cell terminals for their regulation by cannabinoid signaling (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b\u2013e</a>) and observed that synaptic excitation and inhibition evoked by visual stimuli are reduced in response to CB1R activation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3m\u2013p</a>). While a reduction in synaptic inhibition could potentially contribute to the cannabinoid-dependent enhancement of RGC firing that we detected, it is unlikely to fully account for this phenomenon for three reasons. First, the primary effect that we observed was a specific decrease in RGC [Cl]<sub>i</sub> leading to membrane hyperpolarization. This should enhance inhibitory driving force rather than decrease it and therefore is more consistent with our model that tonic pre-hyperpolarization helps prime the cell to fire more robustly to subsequent depolarization, which we demonstrated can occur in RGCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6j,k</a>). Second, the fact that direct, instantaneous electrical stimulation of RGCs with an electrode in the RGC layer, which entirely bypasses upstream retinal circuitry, still resulted in a strychnine-sensitive enhancement of retinotectal EPSCs by CB1R activation is strongly indicative of direct tonic changes in RGC excitability. Third, when measuring evoked firing rates of RGCs, we did not find that pharmacological blockade of GABA-A receptors or GlyRs increased the excitability of RGCs. To the contrary, the fact that inhibition of NKCC1 or blockade of GlyRs completely eliminated the CB1R-dependent enhancement of RGC firing rates, taken together with Clomeleon imaging data showing that [Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is selectively altered in RGCs argues that direct, cell-autonomous changes in RGC excitability rather than modulation of upstream synaptic transmission constituted the primary mechanism underlying the increased firing in response to visual stimulation. The CB1R-mediated reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in bipolar cell terminals seems more likely to impact vision by attenuating the signal from the outer retina to RGCs as has been well-documented in other species (<a href=\"#bib47\">Middleton and Protti, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Straiker et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yazulla et al., 2000</a>)."

The change in slope of the E<sub>Gly</sub> I-V curve upon WIN 55,212-2 perfusion, apparent in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a>, may provide further support for this idea. GlyR modulation could act synergistically with the augmentation of tonic inhibition via the changes in [Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]<sub>i</sub> that we demonstrated to enhance intrinsic excitability of RGCs. On the other hand, it would counter any mechanism that relied on synaptic disinhibition. A direct enhancement of GlyRs by cannabinoids might account for why strychnine, but not gabazine, was most effective at preventing the effects of WIN 55,212-2 on RGC excitability."

Suppression of HVA Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents has been reported in dissociated rat RGCs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lalonde et al., 2006</a>). Interestingly, RGCs are known to express both the synthetic (NAPE-PLD) and degradative (FAAH) enzymes for AEA (<a href=\"#bib46\">Maione et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yazulla et al., 1999</a>), suggesting they also may be a source of eCBs. In support of this idea, the CB1R-dependent reduction in synaptic drive from bipolar and amacrine interneurons can be induced by direct RGC membrane depolarization (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). Based on our present data, we propose that AEA release additionally acts in an auto- or paracrine manner to enhance RGC excitability. Opposing actions on bipolar cell terminals and RGCs may serve a useful role to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of visual responses by maintaining a vigorous retinal output while attenuating excessive synaptic noise from the outer retina (<a href=\"#bib30\">Grimes et al., 2014</a>). This may explain our finding that CB1R activation dramatically improved behavioral responses to dark moving cues near absolute threshold for visual detection."

This is reminiscent of the so-called \u2018Westheimer effect\u2019 where detection sensitivity for a small test flash at the center of a background disk improves as the background disk increases in size, an effect shown in humans (<a href=\"#bib67\">Westheimer, 1965</a>) and lower vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burkhardt, 1974</a>). The sensitization component of this effect generally has been explained based on the antagonistic center and surround regions of the RGC RF, such that progressive stimulation in the surround decreases net excitation. However, important limitations to this model exist (<a href=\"#bib24\">Essock et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sinai et al., 1999</a>) and recent research has revealed that sensitization to temporal contrast changes can last for seconds in individual regions of the RGC surround field and may therefore mediate a predictive function (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kastner and Baccus, 2013</a>). The CB1R-dependent sensitization of mesopic RGC responses that we report here can persist for minutes, but appears to require prolonged stimulation in the periphery to produce the eCBs that induce it. This mechanism may be beneficial as a means of optimizing RGC signal-to-noise ratios during the initial period of dark adaptation before photoreceptors obtain maximum sensitivity."

ERGs were amplified using an extracellular amplifier (A-M Systems 1800,\u00a0Sequim, WA) set to 1000x gain, and low-pass filtered at 300\u2009Hz. The ERG traces and action potentials were analyzed by using custom-written software in IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics). ERG recordings were verified by application of L-AP4 (50 \u00b5M), which selectively blocks transmission between photoreceptors and ON-bipolar cells in the retina, and fully suppressed the b-wave as expected (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The lens was gently removed from one eye to expose the retina. The skin on the head was cut, and the brain was opened along the midline for tectal recording. For recordings, the tadpole was fixed to a PDMS insert in the recording chamber with insect pins. The tadpole was constantly perfused with fresh external solution, and all experiments were performed at the room temperature.

The same size patch pipette was used for extracellular RGC stimulation except that it was filled with external solution. For optic chiasm stimulation experiments, the brain was dissected out into external solution, filleted flat by transecting the dorsal midline and pinned to a Sylgard base in a recording perfusion chamber. A custom-bent 25\u2009mm cluster electrode (FHC, Maine) was positioned onto the optic chiasm through which constant current electrical stimulation was delivered using a stimulus isolation unit (AMPI, Israel). Test pulses to evoke retinotectal EPSCs were applied every 30\u2009s in voltage clamp. Recordings were acquired with a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and Clampex software (Molecular\u00a0Devices). Signals were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz. Input resistance (0.5\u20131 GOhm) and series resistance (30\u201370 MOhm) were monitored continuously during recordings. Data were accepted for analysis only if the series resistance and input resistance remained relatively constant (&lt;20% change) throughout the experiment. Cells were held at a holding potential of \u221260 mV. To measure visual receptive fields of tectal neurons, visual stimuli were presented on an 800 \u00d7 600 pixel, 9 \u00d7 12\u2009mm SVGA 3D OLED-XL color microdisplay (eMagin,\u00a0Hopewell Junction, NY) mounted in place of one microscope eyepiece using a custom built frame. The image was then focused onto the photoreceptor layer of the retina through the microscope objective. The screen displayed a 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07 pixel array, each pixel (30\u00a0\u00b5m square) of which independently turned off for 200 ms in random order at 0.067\u00a0Hz to drive receptive field OFF stimulation.

For each experiment, eight animals at a time were filmed using a digital camcorder (SONY HDR-CX250B), while the screen displayed dark moving dot stimuli (10\u00a0mm dia., 2 cm s<sup>\u22121</sup>) following a ballistic random walker trajectory\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib48\">Molin\u00e0s-Mata et al., 1996</a>). A pre-test period of 3\u2009min, with dots having the same luminance as the background (invisible dots) was used to establish the frequency of random chance false positive dot avoidance behaviors. During the test period, lasting 5\u2009min, the screen displayed either a white background of high intensity (photopic, 190 \u00b1 4.2\u2009cd m<sup>\u22122</sup>) or of low intensity (mesopic, 0.65 \u00b1 0.05\u2009cd m<sup>\u22122</sup>), with dark dots of different luminances for each trial. Custom MATLAB 'Tadtracker' code (available for download at <a href=\"http://ruthazerlab.mcgill.ca/local.htm\">http://ruthazerlab.mcgill.ca/local.htm</a>) was created to track each tadpole independently in the recorded videos and measure their reactions by correlating their locations, relative to the dots, with changes in their swimming speed to the dot coordinates. Tadpole positions were calculated based on image contrast to background with the software always identifying the eight objects fitting the criteria for a tadpole based on size and interpolation of previous and subsequent positions, and excluding the positions of known moving dot stimuli. Velocities were measured between each frame at 30\u2009Hz video rate and then Gaussian smoothed to reduce the effects of noise on the tracking. A potential dot avoidance event was counted whenever a dot came within 5\u2009mm of a tadpole. A successful avoidance event was logged if swimming velocity changed by at least 24\u2009mm s<sup>\u22121</sup> within 0.25\u2009s of initial encounter. This threshold was determined empirically based on the acquisition frame-rate and baseline rates of tadpole movement as one which unambiguously constituted a reaction to the visual environment. We noted that histograms of tadpole swimming speeds showed a dual power law distribution ranging from 0 to 200\u2009mm s<sup>\u22121</sup> with a critical point at 24\u2009mm s<sup>\u22121</sup>."

The authors show that CB1 receptors are expressed in the <i>Xenopus</i> tadpole retina, including ganglion cells, and that CB1 receptor activation by exogenous or endogenous ligands enhances light-evoked spike responses in ganglion cells. Enhanced responses are not observed in bipolar or amacrine cells, indicating an effect on ganglion cells. The enhancement requires glycine receptor-mediated inhibition and is mimicked and occluded by blockade of the chloride transporter NKCC1. They go on to show that CB1 inhibits NKCC1 via AMP-dependent kinase. This reduction in NKCC1 activity lowers intracellular chloride, hyperpolarizing the ganglion cell membrane potential. The authors argue that this hyperpolarization actually enhances spiking response to light stimulation by reducing sodium channel inactivation. They show that CB1 activation regulates light-evoked firing in ganglion cells, enhances responses and broadens receptive fields in the tectum and enhances visually evoked behavioral responses under low light conditions. The experiments are cleanly performed and clearly presented. This is an excellent paper."

CB1 receptor activation causes a ~25% increase in light-evoked spike responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and hyperpolarizes the resting membrane potential from -42 mV to -53 mV (perforated patch recordings, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). According to the authors' theory, these data would predict that a similar 11 mV hyperpolarization of the membrane potential would decrease sodium channel inactivation and increase (perhaps by 25%) spiking elicited by a depolarizing current step. The authors show that pre-hyperpolarizing the membrane leads to increased spikes in response to a test current step (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>), but this experiment does not really test the idea as well as it could. First, the hyperpolarizing pre-steps cause a much greater change in membrane potential than that caused by CB1 activation (admittedly, these larger hyperpolarizations also cause larger changes in spiking). Also, there is a 25-ms interval between the end of the hyperpolarizing pre-pulse and the test step, and it's not clear how much change in inactivation occurs during this interval. It would seem more direct to hyperpolarize the membrane potential by 11 mV from rest with a long step, then immediately apply the test pulse to see if the spike response is enhanced 25% relative to the response with no pre-step. In addition, a voltage clamp experiment could be employed to show that, in these cells, sodium channel inactivation is substantially greater at -42 mV compared to -53 mV substantially reduces sodium channel inactivation. This second result is certainly expected, would not show causation, and may not be required; the first experiment (a modification of the protocol shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>) is not necessarily critical but would strengthen the argument considerably."

If the CB1R effects are produced by changes in E_Cl within RGCs, then one might expect to see effects when suppressing either GABA or glycine receptors, as both receptors activate chloride channels in RGCs. This issue is addressed in the Discussion, and it is suggested that CB1Rs have direct, specific effects on glycine but not GABA receptors. No data is presented to support this suggestion. Doesn't this explanation also imply that the major effect of CB1R activation is via receptor modulation rather than changes in internal [Cl]?</i> "

Because any changes in intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> must overcome the Cl<sup>-</sup> loading by the whole-cell recording pipette, this method does not directly demonstrate the changes in intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> levels that would occur in intact cells, but rather reveals the activation of Cl<sup>-</sup> transporters that underlie these changes. We demonstrate that CB1R activation produces a leftward shift in the I-V curve that mimics that produced by directly inhibiting NKCC1 with bumetanide.
