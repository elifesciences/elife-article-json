Here we present a novel computational framework for modeling microbial ecosystems, which combines genome-based model construction with statistical analysis and calibration to experimental data. Using this framework, we examined the dynamics of a community of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains that emerged in laboratory evolution experiments, during which an ancestral strain diversified into two coexisting ecotypes. We constructed a microbial community model comprising the ancestral and the evolved strains, which we calibrated using separate monoculture experiments. Simulations reproduced the successional dynamics in the evolution experiments, and pathway activation patterns observed in microarray transcript profiles. Our approach yielded detailed insights into the metabolic processes that drove bacterial diversification, involving acetate cross-feeding and competition for organic carbon and oxygen. Our framework provides a missing link towards a data-driven mechanistic microbial ecology."

For example, glucose catabolism to carbon dioxide or methane is a multi-step process often involving several organisms that indirectly exchange intermediate products through their environment (<a href=\"#bib55\">Stams, 1994</a>). Microbial communities are thus complex systems comprising several interacting components that cannot be fully understood in isolation. In fact, metabolic interdependencies between organisms are at least partially responsible for our current inability to culture the great majority of prokaryotes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schink and Stams, 2006</a>).

Recent work indicates that multiple cell models can be combined to understand microbial community metabolism and population dynamics (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stolyar et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Klitgord and Segr\u00e8, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zengler and Palsson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chiu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Harcombe et al., 2014</a>).

Experiments and monitoring of environmental samples could provide valuable data to calibrate microbial community models, for example, via statistical parameter estimation, but appropriate tools are lacking. So far, the standard approach has been to obtain each parameter through laborious specific measurements or from the available literature, or to manually adjust parameters to match observations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mahadevan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chiu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Harcombe et al., 2014</a>).

MCM is designed for modeling multi-species microbial communities, in which the metabolism and growth of individual cell species is predicted using genome-based metabolic models. Cells in the community interact in a dynamical environment in which metabolite concentrations and other environmental variables influence, and are influenced by, microbial metabolism. Unknown model parameters can be automatically calibrated (fitted) using experimental data such as cell densities, nutrient concentrations or rate measurements. To demonstrate the potential of MCM, we modeled a bacterial community that has emerged from in vitro evolution experiments, during which an ancestral strain repeatedly diversified into two distinct ecotypes. Experiments with microbes have an established tradition as model systems for understanding ecological and evolutionary processes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Elena and Lenski, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kassen and Rainey, 2004</a>). We show that the predictions derived from MCM are in very good agreement with the outcomes of several monoculture and coculture experiments. While the experimental results described below have been found over the course of several years (<a href=\"#bib20\">Friesen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Spencer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Le Gac et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Herron and Doebeli, 2013</a>), it is only now that a mechanistic model has managed to unify them in a clear, unambiguous and synergistic manner. The analysis presented here thus provides strong credence to a large body of experimental work that was done in our lab over the course of roughly a decade."

The reaction rates and metabolite exchange rates (i.e. the metabolism) of each cell are assumed to depend on its metabolic potential as well as on the current environmental conditions, such as metabolite concentrations.

The chemical state of cells is assumed to be steady, leading to stoichiometric constraints that need to be satisfied for any particular combination of intracellular reaction rates. Reaction rates, on the other hand, are limited due to finite enzyme capacities. Metabolite uptake/export rates can also be limited due to finite diffusion rates or limited transmembrane transporter efficiency. For example, uptake rates can be Monod-like functions of substrate concentrations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mahadevan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Harcombe et al., 2014</a>). Taken together, cell-metabolic potential, stoichiometric consistency, reaction rate limits and transport rate limits define the constraints of a linear optimization problem for each cell species at each point in time. The optimized biosynthesis rate is translated into a cell production rate by dividing by the cell's mass, thus defining the species' population growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Biosynthesis has been experimentally verified as an objective for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burgard and Maranas, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gianchandani et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Harcombe et al., 2013</a>). The assumption of maximized biosynthesis is less valid for genetically engineered organisms or those exposed to environments that are radically different from the environments that shaped their evolution (<a href=\"#bib51\">Segr\u00e8 et al., 2002</a>). Despite its limitations, FBA has greatly contributed to the understanding of several genome-scale metabolic networks and metabolic interactions between cells (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stolyar et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Klitgord and Segr\u00e8, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Orth et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Freilich et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chiu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Harcombe et al., 2014</a>). One advantage of FBA models over full biochemical cell models is their independence of intracellular kinetics and gene regulation, which limits the number of required parameters to stoichiometric coefficients and uptake kinetics."

                                "text": "The combination of FBA with a varying environmental metabolite pool, as implemented by MCM, is known as dynamic flux balance analysis (DFBA) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mahadevan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chiu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Harcombe et al., 2014</a>). In contrast to conventional FBA, DFBA models are dynamical because cell densities and environmental metabolite concentrations both change with time, and the rate of change of each cell density and metabolite concentration depends on the current cell densities and metabolite concentrations (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mahadevan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Harcombe et al., 2014</a>). Because metabolites can be depleted or produced by several cell species, the environmental metabolite pool mediates the metabolic interactions between cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schink and Stams, 2006</a>). For example, oxygen uptake rates might depend on environmental oxygen concentrations, which in turn are reduced by cellular respiration. Similarly, cells might excrete acetate as a byproduct of glucose catabolism, which then becomes available to other cells. The metabolic optimization of individual cells striving for maximal growth, while modifying their environment, leads to non-trivial community dynamics that can include competition, cooperation and exploitation. The cell-centric nature of DFBA differs fundamentally from other flux balance analyses of microbial communities that assume an optimization of a community-wide objective such as total biomass synthesis (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stolyar et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Klitgord and Segr\u00e8, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zomorrodi and Maranas, 2012</a>). Such an assumption is at least questionable from an evolutionary perspective and likely not appropriate for communities comprising several species (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mitri and Foster, 2013</a>)."

For example, <a href=\"#bib25\">Harcombe et al. (2014)</a> designed a computational tool (COMETS) based on DFBA, which was able to accurately predict equilibrium compositions of mixed bacterial cultures grown on petri dishes. However, COMETS offers limited model versatility in terms of uptake and reaction kinetics and only has few environmental feedback mechanisms (namely, varying extracellular metabolite concentrations). Furthermore, it assumes complete knowledge of all required model parameters and provides no generic statistical model analysis. Hence, while COMETS sets an important precedent, considerable work is still needed to make DFBA a practical approach in microbial ecosystem modeling. MCM extends Harcombe et al.'s framework to more versatile microbial ecological models that include arbitrary reaction kinetics (e.g., subject to product-inhibition) as well as dynamical environmental variables (e.g., pH) that influence, and are influenced by, microbial metabolism. In addition, MCM supports cell models in which internal molecules act as dynamical constraints that further restrict the FBA solution space, for example to account for post-transcriptional regulation or delays in enzyme synthesis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blazier and Papin, 2012</a>). These so called regulatory FBA models have been shown to improve the fidelity of conventional FBA models for <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Covert et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Covert and Palsson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Covert et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Herrg\u00e5rd et al., 2006</a>), however their application to microbial communities remains untested. MCM can statistically evaluate models against data, analyze their sensitivity to varying parameters (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cariboni et al., 2007</a>), and estimate the uncertainty of model predictions in the face of stochasticity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hammersley and Handscomb, 1964</a>). Perhaps most importantly, MCM can automatically calibrate unknown model parameters to data, for example obtained from monoculture experiments (as demonstrated below), from bioreactor experiments involving multiple species (<a href=\"#bib38\">Louca and Doebeli, 2015</a>) or from environmental samples of unculturable communities (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; see the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and the Supplement for details). MCM can thus be used to understand the dynamics of realistic microbial ecosystems, ranging from the soil or groundwater to mixed laboratory cultures and bioreactors."

When grown in monoculture with the same medium composition, all three strains exhibit diauxic growth curves with a fast glucose-driven growth phase followed by slower growth on acetate. However, the three strains differ in their efficiencies to catabolize glucose and acetate: Strain SS (slow switcher) is a better glucose utilizer when compared to strain A, and the depletion of glucose only leads to a slow switch to acetate consumption. On the other hand, the FS (fast switcher) strain has evolved to be a better acetate utilizer, initiating acetate consumption at higher remnant glucose concentrations than strains A and SS. This acetate specialization is based on a tradeoff in the citric acid cycle and comes at the cost of being a less competitive glucose consumer."

The specialization of the SS and FS types on glucose and acetate, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), enables their long-term coexistence on glucose-acetate enriched medium through frequency dependent competition (<a href=\"#bib20\">Friesen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Le Gac et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Herron and Doebeli, 2013</a>).

This periodic acetate cross-feeding is an evolutionarily emergent property of the microbial community (<a href=\"#bib59\">Treves et al., 1998</a>). The temporary production of acetate by the SS type is consistent with previous SS-FS coculture experiments, which revealed slightly increased acetate concentrations towards the end of the SS exponential growth phase (<a href=\"#bib53\">Spencer et al., 2007</a>).

Shortly after dilution into fresh medium, the exponential growth of the SS type on glucose leads to a rapid drop of oxygen to nanomolar concentrations. Despite oxygen diffusion into the medium, oxygen remains at sub-saturation levels for several more hours because the slow-growing acetate-consuming FS cells still consume oxygen after the growth of SS cells has halted. Differences in SS and FS growth rates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,E</a>) thus mitigate competition for oxygen through temporal niche separation. Hence, oxygen likely plays an important role in the metabolic diversification, as previously hypothesized by <a href=\"#bib37\">Le Gac et al. (2008)</a>.

Furthermore, the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate (<i>ppc</i>), the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate (<i>pyk</i>) and the decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (<i>pdh</i>), linking the glycolysis pathway to the citric acid cycle, are all upregulated in the SS type when compared to the FS type. Similar differences in pathway activation also exist during early exponential growth in monoculture (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), because FS grows partly on acetate and SS excretes acetate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,J</a>). Previous microarray profiles of mRNA concentrations during exponential growth in monocultures (<a href=\"#bib37\">Le Gac et al., 2008</a>) found an upregulation of acetate consumption genes in FS and acetate excretion genes in SS compared to A, qualitatively confirming our predictions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Interestingly, our simulations suggest a significant downregulation of glucose catabolism (<i>pyk</i>, <i>pdh</i> and <i>ppc</i>) in FS compared to A, which contradicts the transcript profiles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). However, mRNA was harvested from well-aerated flasks, while the monoculture experiments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and evolution experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) were performed in test tubes where oxygen can become limiting (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andersen and von Meyenburg, 1980</a>). Oxygen becomes particularly scarce in the FS tubes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a>) and temporarily limits glucose catabolism, which would explain the strong downregulation not reflected in the transcript profiles (<a href=\"#bib37\">Le Gac et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, while broad pathway activation patterns could be qualitatively reproduced in our system, this might be harder in other cases due to post-transcriptional regulation or post-translational modifications (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blazier and Papin, 2012</a>)."

Experiments with SS-FS batch cocultures revealed that the SS type quickly dominates over the FS type, when restricted to the first glucose-rich season through frequent dilution into fresh growth medium. Reciprocally, when SS and FS are grown in solution resembling the second glucose-depleted acetate-rich season, the FS type quickly dominates over the SS type (<a href=\"#bib53\">Spencer et al., 2007</a>). Accordingly, in a full batch cycle the relative SS cell density has been shown to culminate within 4\u20138 hr and to gradually decrease afterwards (<a href=\"#bib20\">Friesen et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), in consistence with our simulations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

In particular, no information from co-culture experiments was used in the setup of the microbial community model, and thus there was no a priori knowledge about what the emergent community dynamics would be. Hence, our work conceptually produced non-trivial predictions that could be compared to experimental observations, although all experiments had already been performed."

In particular, our model allowed quantitative predictions for the metabolic fluxes for each strain in coculture, revealing temporary cross-feeding as an emergent property of the evolved community (<a href=\"#bib59\">Treves et al., 1998</a>). Cross-feeding, conventionally seen as a beneficial interaction (<a href=\"#bib44\">Morris et al., 2013</a>), thus emerged as a form of niche segregation driven by competition for organic carbon and oxygen. Because both evolved types prefer glucose whenever available at high concentrations, but exchange acetate under oxygen limitation, the community constantly switches between competitive and beneficial interactions. Natural microbial populations might thus also oscillate between negative and positive interactions, for example depending on oxygen levels. Our findings also support previous suggestions that microbial evolution can be driven by deterministic ecological processes (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wood et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Oxman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Herron and Doebeli, 2013</a>). In this case, the observed diversification is due to competition for limiting resources whose use is constrained by basic metabolic tradeoffs. Other instances of ecological diversification in microbial evolution experiments, for example as reported by <a href=\"#bib48\">Plucain et al. (2014)</a>, might be explained using a similar approach."

Our framework thus provides a starting point for designing microbial communities with particular metabolic properties, such as optimized catabolic performance. While MCM is designed for genome-based metabolic models, it can also accommodate conventional functional group models. In these models, different ecological functions such as photosynthesis, heterotrophy or nitrification are performed by distinct populations whose metabolic activity is determined, for example, by Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics and whose growth is described by simple substrate-biomass yield factors (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hood et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Reed et al., 2014</a>). Hence, natural microbial communities could be modeled even if annotated genomes are not available for each member species. While functional group models general require fewer parameters, their calibration remains a challenge (<a href=\"#bib47\">Panikov and Sizova, 1996</a>). In MCM, model calibration becomes analogous to coefficient estimation in conventional multivariate regression, and can be used to estimate poorly known parameters such as stoichiometric coefficients, growth kinetics or extracellular transport coefficients (MCM user manual, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, section 12). To our knowledge, no existing comparable framework offers the flexibility combined with the statistical functionality of MCM. In view of the increasing availability of genome-scale metabolic models (<a href=\"#bib17\">Feist et al., 2008</a>), our work provides a missing link to a predictive and synthetic microbial ecology."

This versatility allows for the incorporation of complex environmental feedbacks, such as host immune responses in gut microbiota (<a href=\"#bib32\">Karlsson et al., 2011</a>). Metabolite uptake and export rate limits can be arbitrary functions of metabolite concentrations or environmental variables. Similar interdependencies are possible for reaction rate limits, thus allowing the inclusion of inhibitory or regulatory mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib11\">Covert et al., 2008</a>). Metabolite concentrations can be explicitly specified, for example, using measured time series, or depend dynamically on microbial export and other external fluxes. Effects of phage predation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jensen et al., 2006</a>), reaction energetics (<a href=\"#bib49\">Reed et al., 2014</a>) or stochastic environments can also be incorporated."

Metabolic activity statistics (e.g., <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>) facilitate the identification of metabolic interactions such as cross-feeding (<a href=\"#bib44\">Morris et al., 2013</a>).

Symbolic parameters can represent, for example, stoichiometric coefficients, gene copy numbers, cell life expectancies, half-saturation constants or environmental variables. The inclusion of symbolic parameters enables a high-level analysis of microbial communities: For example, MCM can automatically calibrate (fit) unknown symbolic parameters to time series using maximum\u2013likelihood parameter estimation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eliason, 1993</a>). The likelihood of the data, given a particular parameter choice, is calculated by assuming a mixed deterministic-stochastic model in which the deterministic part is given by the model predictions, and the stochastic part is given by normally distributed errors. The likelihood is minimized using an iterative optimization algorithm involving step-wise parameter adjustments and repeated simulations. Other fitting algorithms are also available, such as maximization of the average coefficient of determination (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>), which is equivalent to weighted least-squares fitting. Because MCM can calibrate unknown measurement units, raw uncalibrated data (e.g., optical cell densities with no calibration to colony forming units, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) can also be used."

In general, fitted parameters need not be directly connected to the data used for calibration, as long as a change in the parameters influences the predictions that are being compared to the data. While this is a general principle of parameter estimation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tarantola, 2005</a>), in practice the uncertainty of calibrated parameters (e.g., in terms of confidence intervals) increases when their influence on the \u2018goodness of fit\u2019 is weaker. Moreover, alternative parameter combinations can sometimes yield a comparable match to the data, especially if multiple parameters influence the same variables (inverse problem degeneracy). Local fitting optima can be detected through repeated randomly seeded calibrations (see next section), and overfitting can be partially avoided by keeping the number of free parameters at a bare minimum. Nevertheless, in certain cases good knowledge of the system or previous literature may be required to identify the most plausible calibrations. Finally, we emphasize that MCM is, after all, merely a framework enabling the construction, calibration and analysis of microbial community models. MCM models are thus limited by the same caveats and assumptions as other constraint-based metabolic models (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blazier and Papin, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Antoniewicz, 2013</a>) and any predictions made by MCM should be subject to similar scrutiny."

What have we learned? From the point of view of this biological system, this paper provided yet another piece of data to the many already existing that the niche for FS emerges after the SS rise in frequency, but does not go to fixation. This has been known for quite a while, but it is nice to see the model agree with this finding. The calibration of individual genome scale models prior to studying communities seems a nice addition to existing frameworks, in fact one that should become a standard approach, whenever possible, for ecosystem-level modeling. The modeling and calibration software developed by the authors seems very well documented."

We would like to see a comparison of predicted metabolic and population dynamics with experimental coculture dynamics. There are no new experiments to test any predicted effect of perturbations. To at least test that FS can't invade alone is totally easy. Presumably one could also find an acetate concentration that would have been high enough to obviate the need for SS to come first (or a shorter duration or larger dilution that would have left enough acetate by the time of the transfer to have had the same effect). Another major prediction \u2013 that was pretty cool \u2013 is that acetate is excreted during a short window of time. This would be an excellent experiment to validate the model's predictions. Finally, you have to actually <i>show</i> us the comparison of predicted fluxes and mRNA that is supposed to be such a great fit. If it really is that good, we'd be rather impressed, for there is a huge literature about how this is not the case."

I am not sure how, for example, COMETS of the Segre group could have predicted the spatial-temporal dynamics in microbial communities if they had not somehow calibrated their model. Only after I talked to an expert did I realize that usually parameter choice is done through looking for values in literature, which leaves a few tunable parameters. Then, parameters are adjusted manually to fit experimental dynamics. This is because some of these parameters may not be directly measured experimentally. A thoughtful discussion on this will be helpful."

Also: is the fitted ATP maintenance the value for the non-growth associated maintenance, or the coefficients of growth-associated maintenance? Second, it would important for readers to know whether the solutions found by the fitting algorithm are unique, and how sensitive the result are to parameter precision. Sensitivity analyses are discussed in the user manual, and seem to have been applied to a different microbial community. I think it would be particularly important to know whether the main result of stable coexistence is sensitive to the choice of fitted parameters."

This is a central tenet of Metabolic Control Analysis, and has been well documented and commented upon by folks such as Dan Fraenkel (2003, Current Opinion in Microbiology) and Hans Westerhoff (Rossell et al., 2006. PNAS). This possibility must be addressed to make the reader aware that there should never be the assumption that flux is proportionally related to enzyme levels for all enzymes. If that were so, every enzyme would have a control coefficient of 1, which is absolutely impossible because the sum of control coefficients from the entire cell is 1."

At the very least, acknowledge where this is so, and use it as an opportunity to more precisely say where this goes above and beyond. For example, I like the inherent fitting of data and perhaps more could be made of exactly how this works.

These modeling results provide very strong credence to a large body of experimental work that was done in our lab over the course of roughly a decade.\u201d I think that a slightly expanded version of this text would help orient the broad readership towards understanding why their example is interesting (in addition to the fact that it works)."

I am referring in particular to the last paragraph in the subsection \u201cModel\u201d, which is quite problematic in a number of ways. For example, regulation (both allosteric and transcriptional) in FBA models is notoriously a very tricky, overall unresolved problem. MCM has the potentially useful feature of allowing users to set rules to limit fluxes as a function of other parameters. This feature, described in one page in the user manual, is oversold in the main text as a capacity of MCM to include regulation. Similarly superficial is the description of the inclusion of phages in the model. Again, this is described shortly in the user manual with no justification or testing. All these features are unnecessarily used as a way of contrasting MCM with previous software, leading to unjustified conclusions, e.g. that COMETS \u201coffers limited model versatility in terms of uptake kinetics\u201d (COMETS does allow different parameters for different molecules and organisms, even if parameters were chosen to be equal in the specific simulations presented in the COMETS paper), that COMETS \u201cseems limited to Petri dishes\u201d, whereas \u201cMCM can be used to understand the dynamics of realistic microbial communities, ranging from the soil or groundwater to artificial communities and bioreactors\u201d. Both COMETS and MCM, after all, were based on the same underlying modeling framework, and tested on laboratory systems. I think the authors should definitely mention (with added accuracy) \u2013 perhaps in the Discussion \u2013 the additional features of their software that are not described and tested in detail in the main text. At the same time, I think they should limit their claims of major innovation to the components that are actually tested and presented in detail. The capacity to perform calibration on individual organisms, followed by proof of predictive capacity of the global dynamics on a highly interesting system is elegant and brilliant, and I think it is unnecessarily weakened by these other dubious claims."

This calibration yields the parameters that we used to characterize each of the three strains (ancestor, SS and FS). We then put these three calibrated strains into an artificial MCM community, which predicted emergent dynamics of the microbial community. Because the model strains were calibrated in monoculture, there was no guarantee as to what these emergent dynamics would be. Our main result is that in fact, the emergent dynamics very closely correspond to those that had previously been found in a series of co-culture experiments. Thus, conceptually our model yielded predictions that were borne out by experiments, albeit experiments that had already been performed. Nevertheless, the editors' and reviewers' suggestion for a more extensive experimental validation is well taken, and we have now expanded that part of the manuscript."

I am referring in particular to the last paragraph in the subsection \u201cModel\u201d, which is quite problematic in a number of ways. For example, regulation (both allosteric and transcriptional) in FBA models is notoriously a very tricky, overall unresolved problem. MCM has the potentially useful feature of allowing users to set rules to limit fluxes as a function of other parameters. This feature, described in one page in the user manual, is oversold in the main text as a capacity of MCM to include regulation. Similarly superficial is the description of the inclusion of phages in the model. Again, this is described shortly in the user manual with no justification or testing. All these features are unnecessarily used as a way of contrasting MCM with previous software, leading to unjustified conclusions, e.g. that COMETS \u201coffers limited model versatility in terms of uptake kinetics\u201d (COMETS does allow different parameters for different molecules and organisms, even if parameters were chosen to be equal in the specific simulations presented in the COMETS paper), that COMETS \u201cseems limited to Petri dishes\u201d, whereas \u201cMCM can be used to understand the dynamics of realistic microbial communities, ranging from the soil or groundwater to artificial communities and bioreactors\u201d. Both COMETS and MCM, after all, were based on the same underlying modeling framework, and tested on laboratory systems. I think the authors should definitely mention (with added accuracy) \u2013 perhaps in the Discussion \u2013 the additional features of their software that are not described and tested in detail in the main text. At the same time, I think they should limit their claims of major innovation to the components that are actually tested and presented in detail. The capacity to perform calibration on individual organisms, followed by proof of predictive capacity of the global dynamics on a highly interesting system is elegant and brilliant, and I think it is unnecessarily weakened by these other dubious claims</i>."
