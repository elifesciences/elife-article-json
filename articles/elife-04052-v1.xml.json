Whether imp\u03b2 or RanGTP regulate the permeability of the NPC itself has been unknown. Here, we identify a stable pool of imp\u03b2 at the NPC. A subpopulation of this pool is rapidly turned-over by RanGTP, likely at Nup153. Imp\u03b2, but not transportin-1 (TRN1), alters the pore's permeability in a Ran-dependent manner, suggesting that imp\u03b2 is a functional component of the NPC. Upon reduction of Nup153 levels, inert cargos more readily equilibrate across the NPC yet active transport is impaired. When purified imp\u03b2 or TRN1 are mixed with Nup153 in vitro, higher-order, multivalent complexes form. RanGTP dissolves the imp\u03b2\u2022Nup153 complexes but not those of TRN1\u2022Nup153. We propose that imp\u03b2 and Nup153 interact at the NPC's nuclear face to form a Ran-regulated mesh that modulates NPC permeability."
