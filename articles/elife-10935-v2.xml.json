Excess light chains are in equilibrium between dimers and less stable monomers which can undergo irreversible aggregation to the amyloid state. The dimers therefore must disassociate into monomers prior to forming amyloid fibrils. Here we identify ligands that inhibit amyloid formation by stabilizing the Mcg light chain variable domain dimer and shifting the equilibrium away from the amyloid-prone monomer."

Excess light chains are in equilibrium between dimers and less stable monomers which can undergo irreversible aggregation to the amyloid state. The dimers therefore must disassociate into monomers prior to forming amyloid fibrils. Here we identify ligands that inhibit amyloid formation by stabilizing the Mcg light chain variable domain dimer and shifting the equilibrium away from the amyloid-prone monomer."

These deposits show common structural and biochemical characteristics, including non-covalent self-complementary fibrils, resistance to proteolysis, insolubility in aqueous solution, binding of thioflavin dye, and generation of a cross-\u03b2 X-ray diffraction pattern. The spine of amyloid fibrils, termed a\u00a0'steric zipper,' is built by paired \u03b2-sheets with interdigitating side chains and serves as the scaffold for fibril extension. The inter-strand and inter-sheet distances give rise to a characteristic cross-\u03b2 X-ray diffraction pattern of two perpendicular reflections at ~4.8 and ~10\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Geddes et al., 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hobbs, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sipe and Cohen, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nelson et al., 2005</a>). Formation of a steric zipper requires the presence of a discrete peptide segment with an amino acid sequence capable of forming a self-complimentary propagating structure. Such segments are commonly found as integral parts of globular proteins and trigger aggregation into amyloid fibrils only upon exposure to solvent through full or partial denaturation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nelson et al., 2005</a>)."

Systemic AL amyloidosis is characterized by overexpression of monoclonal LCs, which are able to form homo-dimers. Despite renal clearance of excess protein, the full-length LCs or their fragments still form amyloid fibril deposits in patients\u2019 tissues, most frequently in the heart and kidneys, which result in organ failure (<a href=\"#bib20\">Falk et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Buxbaum, 1986</a>).

The cavity between the two V<sub>L</sub> domains in Mcg is capable of binding a wide array of ligands, including synthetic organic molecules and peptides, which form contacts with the side chains of the dimer cavity. The cavity spans most of the 24\u2009\u00c5-long dimer interface; it is cylindrically shaped and can be considered to constitute three sites: A, B and C (<a href=\"#bib17\">Edmundson et al., 1984</a>). Based on the geometry of the dimer with some deviation from the original nomenclature by Edmundson <i>et al.,</i> we designate side chains of residues Y34, Y93, D97 and F99 on one side of the cylindrical cavity as the 'A-site,' S36, Y51, E52, S91 and F101 as the 'B-site,' and Y38, Q40, V48 and Y89 as the 'C-site' (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Some ligands bind the cavity in a sequential manner without a distinct preference for one of the sites. For example, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid binds in either the A or C-sites and can migrate between them, whereas fluorescein binds to both sites with partial occupancy. Other molecules, such as menadione, preferentially bind to only one of the sites (<a href=\"#bib17\">Edmundson et al., 1984</a>). Regardless of binding location, this demonstrates the dimer cavity is capable of accommodating various hydrophobic and aromatic ligands."

A similar approach was used to design therapies for transthyretin-related amyloidosis by stabilizing the tetrameric state of the protein (<a href=\"#bib39\">Miroy et al., 1996</a>). Initial screening for ligands that hinder V<sub>L</sub> amyloid formation revealed four ligands showing this effect, with methylene blue as the strongest binding ligand.

One of the molecules from our screen, epigallocatechin gallate, was recently suggested to hinder the formation of amyloid fibrils, yet in our experiments it did not show any effect (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pelaez-Aguilar et al., 2015</a>)."

The crystal structure of Mcg with methylene blue shows binding at the A-site of the V<sub>L</sub> dimer cavity and coordination by the side chains of residues Y34, Y93, D97 and F99. The crystal belongs to space\u00a0group P2<sub>1</sub> with one dimer per asymmetric unit, and the symmetry between the two V<sub>L</sub> domains of Mcg is broken by the presence of a sulfate ion bound to only one of the V<sub>L</sub> domains (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis of the soluble quaternary state indicates the dimer as the most prevalent form of the complex versus monomer without a bound ligand (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brumshtein et al., 2014</a>). We also observed a small fraction of oligomers with molecular weights larger than dimers, as confirmed by the meniscus depletion experiment. The meniscus depletion distributes quaternary states along the path length of the sample cell during analytical centrifugation, thus verifying which state accounts for the deviation in apparent molecular weight. The most significant outcome is the complete absence of soluble monomer in complex with the ligand, which verifies our conjecture that the ligands bind and stabilize dimers. In the case of sulfasalazine, to confirm binding specifically to soluble dimers, the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments identified dimers as the only quaternary state of the ligand-bound complex."

The three experimental findings are: cooperative binding of methylene blue as measured by equilibrium dialysis, binding of the ligand to the A-site in the crystal structure, and the absence of monomeric V<sub>L</sub> in complex with ligand. Taken together, these observations indicate that the secondary binding site of methylene blue may not be available in the crystalline state, but available in solution. Secondary binding to either the B or C-sites may require conformational changes that are less favorable in crystals or induce the higher-order assembly of complexes larger than dimers."

Therefore, the equivalence of the two sulfasalazine ligands in the crystal explains why only one disassociation constant was measured by means of equilibrium dialysis. The crystal structure shows that each of the sulfasalazine ligands occupy all three A-B-C-sites simultaneously; each ligand binds to the A and B-sites on one of the V<sub>L</sub>s composing the dimer, while C-site binding is on the symmetry-related V<sub>L</sub>.

The light chain variable domain dimer dissociates, misfolds and aggregates driving degenerative disease phenotypes. Thus, the authors screened a library of small molecules previously implicated to bind at the variable domain dimer interface. Analysis of electron micrographs and thioflavin T assays reveals that increasing the concentration of methylene blue or sulfasalazine hinders the formation of light chain aggregation. Two ligands bind to each dimer, methylene blue binding with positive cooperativity, whereas sulfasalazine binds non-cooperatively. Analytical ultracentrifugation is consistent with ligand binding to and stabilization of the dimer. In the crystal structure only one molecule of methylene blue binds / dimer vs. two molecules of sulfasalazine / dimer. While these two ligands do not bind tightly enough to become drug candidates, they convincingly demonstrate proof-of-principle that molecules that bind to the non-amyloidogenic variable domain light chain dimer prevent light chain aggregation driving light chain amyloidosis. This data provides the incentive for a commercial organization to make a non-amyloidogenic light chain dimer stabilizer."
