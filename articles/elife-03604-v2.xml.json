CNTs also play a crucial role in the uptake of nucleoside-derived drugs, including anticancer and antiviral agents. Understanding how CNTs recognize and import their substrates could not only lead to a better understanding of nucleoside-related biological processes but also the design of nucleoside-derived drugs that can better reach their targets. Here, we present a combination of X-ray crystallographic and equilibrium-binding studies probing the molecular origins of nucleoside and nucleoside drug selectivity of a CNT from <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. We then used this information in chemically modifying an anticancer drug so that it is better transported by and selective for a single human CNT subtype. This work provides proof of principle for utilizing transporter structural and functional information for the design of compounds that enter cells more efficiently and selectively."

CNTs also play a crucial role in the uptake of nucleoside-derived drugs, including anticancer and antiviral agents. Understanding how CNTs recognize and import their substrates could not only lead to a better understanding of nucleoside-related biological processes but also the design of nucleoside-derived drugs that can better reach their targets. Here, we present a combination of X-ray crystallographic and equilibrium-binding studies probing the molecular origins of nucleoside and nucleoside drug selectivity of a CNT from <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. We then used this information in chemically modifying an anticancer drug so that it is better transported by and selective for a single human CNT subtype. This work provides proof of principle for utilizing transporter structural and functional information for the design of compounds that enter cells more efficiently and selectively."

Johnson et al. have now revealed the three-dimensional structure of one nucleoside transporter protein bound to different nucleosides and nucleoside-derived chemicals, including three anti-cancer drugs and one anti-viral drug. Some of these chemicals were shown to bind more strongly to the transporter protein than others, and examining the three-dimensional structures revealed that the different chemicals interacted with slightly different amino acids in the transporter protein."

This provides proof of principle that information about the structure and function of a transporter protein can help to redesign chemicals such that they can enter cells more efficiently, and to tailor them for transport by specific transporters. A similar approach may in the future allow researchers to design new nucleoside-derived drugs that are better at getting inside specific cells and, as such, provide effective treatments against cancers and viral infections."

Furthermore, nucleoside analogs have clinical applications as anticancer and antiviral drugs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Damaraju et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jordheim and Dumontet, 2007</a>). Because of their immense biological and clinical importance, efficient entry of nucleosides and their analogs into the cell is crucial to human health and disease. Cellular entry is accomplished by a class of membrane proteins known as nucleoside transporters (NTs). There are two types of NTs in humans: concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs) and equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs). CNTs utilize the energy of ion gradients to actively transport nucleosides into the cell against their concentration gradients while ENTs transport nucleosides down their chemical gradients without the requirement of any additional energy source (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gray et al., 2004b</a>)."

Both NT families possess subtype-dependent nucleoside specificities and tissue distributions, while CNTs are more highly subtype-specific for their substrates and distributions than ENTs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gray et al., 2004b</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Paproski et al., 2013</a>). As a result, different NT subtypes are responsible for the transport of different types of nucleosides and nucleoside drugs, and expression levels of different NTs can predict how patients with certain types of cancer and viral infection will respond to nucleoside-drug treatment (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mackey et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Farre et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Spratlin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gray et al., 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Damaraju et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Marechal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rabascio et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bhutia et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Doehring et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fukao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rau et al., 2013</a>). Since there are three different isoforms of human CNTs (hCNT1-3) that possess differing nucleoside and nucleoside-drug specificities and tissue distributions, greater knowledge of the molecular origins of nucleoside selectivity by CNTs could potentially lead to better-tailored nucleoside drug delivery as well as a better understanding of CNT-mediated physiological processes."

Several SLC families are of particular clinical interest because of their roles in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schlessinger et al., 2013</a>). The recent determination of the structures of several SLC transporters has advanced our understanding of the inner workings of these transporters and expanded the applicability of structure-based ligand discovery using computational methods (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">He et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Newstead et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Johnson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pedersen et al., 2013</a>).

Furthermore, the modified compound now possesses subtype-specific transport among human CNTs. Follow-up structural and mutational studies revealed the origin of subtype-specificity of the modified compound. Not only do our studies illuminate the structural basis of nucleoside selectivity by CNTs but they also provide proof of principle for utilizing membrane transporter structures for the design of drugs with more selective delivery (<a href=\"#bib19\">Han and Amidon, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Majumdar et al., 2004</a>)."

We measured the affinity of vcCNT for 3-methyluridine, which contains a methyl group at this position that blocks the water-mediated interaction, and we found that it significantly decreased the binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 520 \u03bcM, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The purine nucleoside adenosine and the antiviral guanosine analog ribavirin also possess similarly weaker binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 470 and 1530 \u03bcM, respectively). To examine the structural basis of the reduced affinity, we solved the crystal structures of vcCNT-7C8C bound to adenosine (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and ribavirin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The structures reveal that the bulky purine base displaces the water observed in the uridine structure while maintaining similar modes of ribose binding, corroborating the idea that the reduced affinities of adenosine and ribavirin are due to the loss of the water-mediated interactions and highlighting the importance of the water coordinated by Thr 155 and Glu 156 in nucleoside recognition by CNTs."

We also solved the crystal structure of vcCNT-7C8C bound to 5-fluorouridine (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The structure shows that the modified uracil base still fits into the nucleoside-binding site without any structural rearrangements of the protein. To understand the origin of enhanced affinity by the addition of fluorine at the C5 position, we compared the binding affinity of 5-fluorouridine to other C5-substituted uridine analogs with differing electronegativities and atomic radii (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Fluorine is highly electronegative (3.98 on the Pauling scale) and relatively small (1.47 \u00c5 radius). When another highly electronegative but slightly larger halogen, chlorine (3.16, 1.75 \u00c5), is substituted at the C5 position, a similar K<sub>D</sub> is observed (14 \u03bcM). However, when the large, weakly electronegative substituent iodine (2.66, 1.98 \u00c5) or a methyl group (2.55, 2.00 \u00c5) is added, we observe an increase in K<sub>D</sub> (\u223c60 \u03bcM). In short, we observed an increase in affinity with smaller, highly electronegative substituents but a decrease in affinity with larger, less electronegative substituents. What structural feature could account for the differing affinities of these compounds?"

To examine the role of Phe 366 in nucleoside recognition, we mutated this residue and performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. We found that the requirement for Phe at this position is strict, as mutation of this residue to alanine or tyrosine or tryptophan results in significantly decreased binding affinity for uridine while not affecting the stability significantly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

                                "text": "Amino acid residues that interact with the ribose in the vcCNT structure (Glu 332, Asn 368, and Ser 371) are invariant between hCNTs and vcCNT. To probe these interactions, we measured K<sub>D</sub>s for deoxyuridines from which each of the ribose hydroxyls have been removed. Both 3\u2032- and 5\u2032-deoxyuridine yielded K<sub>D</sub> values greater than 2800 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), while the binding affinity for 2\u2032-deoxyuridine is not as drastically affected (K<sub>D</sub> = 170 \u03bcM). Several anticancer nucleoside analog drugs contain modifications at the C2\u2032 position of the ribose. Gemcitabine, for example, is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms bonded to C2\u2032. The measured K<sub>D</sub> of gemcitabine for vcCNT (K<sub>D</sub> = 1370 \u03bcM) is \u223c22-fold higher than that for cytidine (K<sub>D</sub> = 61 \u03bcM) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To understand the structural basis of this significant reduction in binding affinity associated with the fluorine substitutions, we solved the crystal structure of vcCNT-7C8C bound to gemcitabine (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In the uridine-bound structure, a CH\u2013\u03c0 interaction was observed between the C2\u2032 hydrogen and Phe 366 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In order for vcCNT to accommodate for the bulkier fluorine atom on the other epimeric position of C2\u2032, which creates steric interference and electrostatic repulsion with the \u03c0 electrons of Phe 366, both Phe 366 and TM7b (including Ser 371) move slightly away from the nucleoside with respect to the uridine-bound structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Furthermore, the ribose of the gemcitabine is reoriented with respect to the other nucleoside-bound structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In addition to the steric and electrostatic disruption of the ribose-binding site, fluorine is a poor substitute for a hydroxyl as a hydrogen-bond acceptor and thus provides a less favorable interaction of the ribose with Ser 371 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Howard et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dunitz and Taylor, 1997</a>). To further test the importance of the epimeric position of the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of the ribose, we attempted to measure the K<sub>D</sub> of another anticancer cytidine analog known as cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) which has its 2\u2032-hydroxyl flipped up above the ribose ring (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Cytarabine displayed no measurable binding when titrated into vcCNT (K<sub>D</sub> &gt; 3000 \u03bcM). Interestingly, consistent with our observation with vcCNT, hCNTs show no significant binding and transport of cytarabine (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clarke et al., 2006</a>). Taken together, these results reveal that the interactions of both the nucleobase and the ribose with Phe 366 and the interactions of the ribose with TM7 are critical for nucleoside recognition by CNTs, which explains the intolerance of CNTs for substituents at the other epimeric position of C2\u2032 of nucleosides."

Because many nucleoside drugs contain modifications at the ribose (e.g., gemcitabine, AZT, and cytarabine), their apparent affinities for hCNTs are low (<a href=\"#bib15\">Graham et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Clarke et al., 2006</a>). We wondered whether this loss of affinity due to ribose modification could be compensated for by modification of the nucleobase. We synthesized a gemcitabine analog with the fluorescent nucleobase of pyrrolo-cytidine, which we now refer to as pyrrolo-gemcitabine (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We measured its binding affinity for vcCNT using the fluorescence-anisotropy assay and found that the K<sub>D</sub> decreased by \u223c60-fold to 24 \u03bcM, suggesting that nucleobase interactions and ribose interactions are additive."

It is known that hCNT1, hCNT3, and hENT1 are the main NTs that transport gemcitabine (<a href=\"#bib33\">Marechal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bhutia et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Damaraju et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Paproski et al., 2013</a>). To detect nucleoside transport by hCNTs, we turned to two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiological recording. Because hCNTs are Na<sup>+</sup>-nucleoside symporters, one can measure the current generated by the Na<sup>+</sup> transport that is coupled with nucleoside transport. We injected <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes with mRNA coding for each of the hCNTs and measured inward Na<sup>+</sup> currents elicited by the addition of different nucleosides to the extracellular side. Addition of 200 \u03bcM gemcitabine to hCNT3-expressing oocytes induced Na<sup>+</sup> currents (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, the same amount of pyrrolo-gemcitabine had almost no effect. The lack of Na<sup>+</sup> current upon addition of pyrrolo-gemcitabine can either mean that hCNT3 is unable to bind the modified compound or hCNT3 binds but cannot transport the modified compound. To resolve this issue, a mixture of equal concentrations of both compounds was added and a reduction of Na<sup>+</sup> current was observed, suggesting that hCNT3 binds to but does not transport pyrrolo-gemcitabine. In contrast, 200 \u03bcM pyrrolo-gemcitabine elicited \u223csevenfold higher total charge uptake than gemcitabine for hCNT1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). hCNT2 transported neither compound (data not shown). Although both hCNT1 and hCNT3 can transport pyrimidines, by modifying the pyrimidine nucleobase of gemcitabine we have created a subtype-specific nucleoside analog with enhanced transportability by hCNT1."

Since the nucleoside-binding site of vcCNT is highly homologous to hCNTs, we generated models of the hCNT1 and hCNT3 nucleo-pockets by swapping out these residues in the vcCNT-pyrrolo-cytidine structure. The structural models of hCNT1 and hCNT3 suggest changes in the overall structure of the nucleo-pocket (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). In particular, the nucleo-pocket of the hCNT1 model does not have a large enough cavity to accommodate the pyrrole ring, and the opening to the intracellular solution is larger due to the smaller side chain on TM6. In the paradigm of the alternating-access mechanism of sodium-coupled symporters (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krishnamurthy et al., 2009</a>), substrate release is achieved by the transition from the inward-facing occluded to the inward-facing open state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Because the structure of vcCNT adopts an inward-facing occluded conformation where TM6, including Leu 259, serves as part of the gate (<a href=\"#bib24\">Johnson et al., 2012</a>), the hCNT1 model suggests that the additional pyrrole group may destabilize the inward-occluded state and facilitate the transition to the inward-open state. In contrast, the additional pyrrole group may stabilize the inward-occluded state of hCNT3 and slow the transition into the inward-open state. Our hypothesis predicts that changing the structure of the nucleo-pocket in the inward-facing state would affect nucleoside transport by hCNTs. Consistent with our prediction, mutation of Val 375 and Leu 446 of hCNT3 to mimic the nucleo-pocket of hCNT1 leads to an increase in transport of pyrrolo-gemcitabine (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Furthermore, mutation of Leu 353 and Val 424 of hCNT1 to mimic the nucleo-pocket of hCNT3 leads to a decrease in transport of pyrrolo-gemcitabine (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>)."

Two helical hairpins (HP1 and HP2) and two unwound helices (TM4 and TM7), related by twofold pseudo-symmetry, create a bowl-shaped nucleoside-binding site at the center of the transport domain of vcCNT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). The interactions with the nucleobase are mainly formed with HP1 and TM4b, and the interactions with the ribose are mainly formed with HP2 and TM7b (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). At the base of the bowl-shaped nucleoside-binding site, Phe 366 interacts with both the nucleobase and the ribose through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 and CH\u2013\u03c0 interactions, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Three features make the architecture of the nucleoside-binding site of vcCNT particularly interesting: (1) the twofold pseudo-symmetry of the binding site that is divided in nucleobase and ribose binding on either side of the symmetry axis; (2) an aromatic ring at the base of the bowl that interacts with both the nucleobase and the ribose; (3) the localization of most of the protein\u2013nucleoside interactions to one side of the nucleoside. These features of the nucleoside-binding site lead to the following questions: What are the energetics of the nucleobase and ribose interactions? What is the role of Phe 366? Why are the interactions with the nucleoside localized to the concave side of the bowl?"

However, while disruption of the nucleobase interactions can have significant effects, the nucleobase can also be modified to improve binding. It is worth noting that our equilibrium-binding studies of vcCNT translate well to hCNT function. For example, we showed that the interaction between the C3\u2032 ribose hydroxyl group and Ser 371 on TM7b is important in vcCNT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C and 4A</a>). Consistent with our observation, the hCNT1S546P variant is non-functional (Ser 546 in hCNT1 is equivalent to Ser 371 in vcCNT) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cano-Soldado et al., 2012</a>). Another important finding of our studies is that interactions with the nucleobase and ribose can be additive, and thus the loss of binding energy from modification of part of the nucleoside can be compensated for by the gain of energy from modification of another part of the nucleoside. Therefore, if a nucleoside drug contains a chemical modification necessary for its pharmacological function that hampers its recognition by CNTs, a compensatory chemical modification can be made so that the drug can still be recognized by CNTs."

The nucleoside-bound structures of vcCNT help to shed light upon the structural basis of the importance of this residue. Notably, Phe 366 is the only residue within the nucleoside-binding site that forms interactions with both portions of the nucleoside. Furthermore, all of the other binding-site residues on HP1, HP2, TM4b, and TM7b interact from the same side of the nucleoside as Phe 366, forming the shape of a bowl around the nucleoside with Phe 366 serving as its base. As a result, the nucleoside rests on the face of Phe 366, likely helping to orient the nucleoside so that it may form all of the other interactions within the binding site. Although \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 and CH\u2013\u03c0 interactions are generally weak, they can provide significant interaction energies depending on the circumstance (<a href=\"#bib55\">Waters, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nishio, 2011</a>). The importance of Phe 366 is demonstrated by the changes in affinity of C5-substituted uridine analogs for vcCNT by altering the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction with the nucleobase and the significant reduction of affinity of C2\u2032-substituted nucleoside drugs via disruption of the CH\u2013\u03c0 interaction with the ribose. Furthermore, ITC experiments with Phe 366 mutants revealed the stringent requirement for phenylalanine at this position, as even replacement with tyrosine resulted in a significant loss of binding affinity for uridine. Taken together, we propose that the role of Phe 366 is to position the nucleoside for effective binding thus serving as a \u2018selectivity ring\u2019."

Several other nucleoside-binding proteins bind to their substrates by sandwiching the nucleobase between aromatic residues (<a href=\"#bib52\">Suzuki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Monecke et al., 2014</a>). The utilization of a bowl-shaped binding site for a transporter makes practical sense as the substrate must be able to bind to and dissociate readily from the binding site in order for efficient transport to occur. We previously proposed that the transport domain undergoes a rigid-body motion while the scaffold domain, including TM6, remains static during the transition from the outward-occluded to the inward-occluded conformational state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Johnson et al., 2012</a>). In the inward-occluded conformation, TM6 (including Leu 259) is located on top of the bowl, serving as part of the intracellular gate and partially occluding the nucleoside from dissociating into the cytoplasm. Portions of HP1 and TM7b form the rest of the intracellular gate and may move slightly during the transition from the inward-occluded to the inward-open conformational state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), allowing the nucleoside to exit from the top of the bowl."

One exception is the interaction between the methylpyrrole ring of pyrrolo-cytidine with the nucleo-pocket, which is likely to preferentially interact with the inward-occluded conformation because of the involvement of part of the scaffold domain (TM6, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5B and 6C</a>), which we expect to be immobile during the conformational change. While both conformations should be represented when the transporter is solubilized in detergent micelles, we anticipate that our structural and equilibrium-binding data revealed most of the amino acid residues that are important for nucleoside recognition. Consistent with our hypothesis, amino acid residues that were shown to be important from our inward-conformation-based binding studies in detergent have also been shown to be important for the binding and transport of nucleosides by human CNTs in several cell-based mutational studies (<a href=\"#bib30\">Loewen et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yao et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Slugoski et al., 2009</a>).

Furthermore, our electrophysiological studies show that it is not only transported more efficiently by hCNT1, but it is also selectively transported by hCNT1. Our structural models of hCNT1 and hCNT3 allowed us to hypothesize that the subtype-specific differences in the structures of the nucleo-pocket in the inward-facing-occluded conformation give rise to the subtype-selectivity of the modified compound. The results of the mutational studies of the nucleo-pockets in hCNTs are consistent with this hypothesis. Although we do not know whether the modification of gemcitabine affects the outward conformation due to the lack of a structure of the outward-facing conformation, our studies suggest that destabilization of the inward-facing-occluded step would facilitate the release of the pyrrolo-gemcitabine. Conversely, stabilization of the outward-facing-occluded step would facilitate the capture of the substrate. Taken together, if one has knowledge of both the outward- and inward-facing conformations of the transporter, it might be possible, at least in principle, to modify a compound to bind to both conformations with differential affinities, which may improve its transportability and selectivity. Prior to our studies, the presence of the nucleo-pocket structure was unknown. Although our study with pyrrolo-gemcitabine serves merely as proof of concept, it is conceivable that the nucleo-pocket structure can be utilized in the design of nucleoside-derived drugs or prodrugs that can be specifically targeted only to cell types that express hCNT1 since expression levels of hCNT1 are closely related to the responsiveness of many different types of normal or cancer cells to chemotherapy treatment (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lane et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Naito et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rabascio et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bhutia et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Choi, 2012</a>)."

This concept has broad applications to many SLC transporters that are involved in ADME since many families such as SLC21, SLC22, and SLC29 possess subtype-dependent drug specificities and/or tissue distributions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baldwin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Koepsell and Endou, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hagenbuch and Stieger, 2013</a>)."

Cells were discarded if resting membrane potentials were unstable or more positive than \u221230 mV. Oocyte membrane potentials were clamped at \u221290 mV for holding potentials to measure transporter-generated currents. All data are shown as means \u00b1 SEM."

Its structure was previously determined at high resolution by the same group. The binding mode of ligand analogues to an inward-facing conformation of the protein was investigated by X-ray crystallography. The data is of high quality and of sufficient resolution to analyze interactions. Next to the crystallographic studies, the binding affinity to the detergent solubilized protein was quantified by a competition assay with a fluorescent ligand and by isothermal titration calorimetry. Taken together the data provides detailed insight into the structural and energetic determinants of the interaction."

On the basis of our vcCNT structure and structural and biophysical studies of related transporters, we previously hypothesized that transport is achieved by a rigid-body motion of the transport domain that maintains similar structures for both the inward- and outward-occluded conformations, and thus the interactions with the nucleoside are similar in both conformations. Our hypothesis is in line with recent studies done by the Boudker group that show that Glt<sub>Ph</sub> samples both conformations with equal probability and the affinities of both conformations are similar in detergent micelles. Thus we assume that most interactions that we showed to be important using nucleoside analogs have effects in both conformations. We think that one exception is the interaction between the methylpyrrole ring of pyrrolo-cytidine with the nucleopocket, which must affect the inward-occluded conformation preferentially because of the involvement of part of the static scaffold domain (TM6). Consistent with our assumption, several mutational studies done on human CNTs show that most of the residues that we believe are important in the inward-facing conformation are also important for the binding and transport of nucleosides. Further structural and biophysical studies of the outward-occluded conformation and associated conformational dynamics will help test our hypothesis."

One exception is the interaction between the methylpyrrole ring of pyrrolo-cytidine with the nucleopocket, which is likely to preferentially interact with the inward-occluded conformation because of the involvement of part of the scaffold domain (TM6, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and 6C</a>), which we expect to be immobile during the conformational change. While both conformations should be represented when the transporter is solubilized in detergent micelles, we anticipate that our structural and equilibrium-binding data revealed most of the amino acid residues that are important for nucleoside recognition. Consistent with our hypothesis, amino acid residues that were shown to be important from our inward-conformation-based binding studies in detergent have also been shown to be important for the binding and transport of nucleosides by human CNTs in several cell-based mutational studies. Further structural and biophysical studies probing the outward-facing state will help us to develop a complete understanding of the principles of nucleoside recognition by CNTs.\u201d"

Conversely, there is a clinical study showing that expression levels of hCNT3 are important for the survival of pancreatic cancer patients with a specific type of gemcitabine treatment, suggesting that an hCNT3-specific gemcitabine derivative could also be effective in this specific case."
