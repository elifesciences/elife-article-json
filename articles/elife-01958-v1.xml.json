Identifying new suppressors of the pathway is important for finding new therapeutic strategies. In this study, we show that <i>MUL1</i> suppresses <i>PINK1</i> or <i>parkin</i> mutant phenotypes in <i>Drosophila</i>. The suppression is achieved through the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Mitofusin, which itself causes <i>PINK1/parkin</i> mutant-like toxicity when overexpressed. We further show that removing <i>MUL1</i> in <i>PINK1</i> or <i>parkin</i> loss-of-function mutant aggravates phenotypes caused by loss of either gene alone, leading to lethality in flies and degeneration in mouse cortical neurons. Together, these observations show that <i>MUL1</i> acts in parallel to the <i>PINK1/parkin</i> pathway on a shared target <i>mitofusin</i> to maintain mitochondrial integrity. The <i>MUL1</i> pathway compensates for loss of <i>PINK1/parkin</i> in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals and is a promising therapeutic target for PD."

In this study, we show that <i>MUL1</i> suppresses <i>PINK1</i> or <i>parkin</i> mutant phenotypes in <i>Drosophila</i>. The suppression is achieved through the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Mitofusin, which itself causes <i>PINK1/parkin</i> mutant-like toxicity when overexpressed. We further show that removing <i>MUL1</i> in <i>PINK1</i> or <i>parkin</i> loss-of-function mutant aggravates phenotypes caused by loss of either gene alone, leading to lethality in flies and degeneration in mouse cortical neurons. Together, these observations show that <i>MUL1</i> acts in parallel to the <i>PINK1/parkin</i> pathway on a shared target <i>mitofusin</i> to maintain mitochondrial integrity. The <i>MUL1</i> pathway compensates for loss of <i>PINK1/parkin</i> in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals and is a promising therapeutic target for PD."

Mutations in PINK1, a mitochondria-localized serine\u2013threonine kinase, and Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, lead to autosomal recessive forms of the disease (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kitada et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Valente et al., 2004</a>). Genetic studies in <i>Drosophila</i> first demonstrated that <i>PINK1</i> and <i>parkin</i> act in the same genetic pathway, with <i>PINK1</i> positively regulating <i>parkin</i>, to regulate mitochondrial integrity and function (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clark et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Park et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yang et al., 2006</a>). Mitochondrial morphology is maintained by a balance between two opposing actions, mitochondrial fusion that is promoted by <i>mitofusin (mfn)</i> and mitochondrial fission that is controlled by <i>Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chan, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</a>). Genetic studies in <i>Drosophila</i> have shown that downregulation of <i>mfn</i> or overexpression of <i>drp1</i> suppresses multiple phenotypes associated with lack of <i>PINK1</i> or <i>parkin,</i> including defects in mitochondrial integrity, cell death, tissue health, and flight ability (<a href=\"#bib15\">Deng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Poole et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yang et al., 2008</a>).

Accumulation of mitochondrial damage can result in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. This leads to recruitment of Parkin to the depolarized mitochondria, ultimately resulting in autophagic degradation of these mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib42\">Narendra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ding et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gegg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Geisler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Matsuda et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Narendra et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Okatsu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tanaka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Vives-Bauza et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chan et al., 2011</a>).

An important step during this process is Parkin-dependent ubiquitination of Mfn and other substrates, followed by their proteasome-dependent degradation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tanaka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chan et al., 2011</a>). Relevant to PD, <i>PINK1</i> and <i>parkin</i> mutant fibroblasts from PD patients also show deregulation of mitochondrial dynamics and modest defects in the clearance of mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rakovic et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2013</a>)."

These physical interactions are specific to MUL1 and Mfn rather than the tags utilized (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To assay ubiquitination, Flag-tagged Mfn was expressed in S2 cells exposed to dsRNA targeting <i>MUL1</i> or <i>parkin</i> in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In control cells, highly ubiquitinated Mfn was observed. When cells were treated with two different dsRNAs against <i>MUL1</i>, ubiquitinated Mfn levels were dramatically reduced, similar to those observed in <i>parkin</i> RNAi-treated cells, which serve as a positive control. Finally, we observed that the increased Mfn levels seen in the <i>PINK1</i> mutant flies were reduced when <i>MUL1</i> was overexpressed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), strengthening our argument that MUL1 suppresses <i>PINK1</i> mutant phenotypes through reduction of Mfn levels.

Alternatively, <i>MUL1</i> could function in a parallel pathway to <i>PINK1/Parkin</i>, but with action on a common target such as Mfn. Characterization of double null mutants provides an effective way of distinguishing these possibilities. If <i>MUL1</i> functions in the same pathway as <i>PINK1</i>, double null mutants of <i>PINK1</i> and <i>MUL1</i> would be expected to show the same phenotype as the single mutant alone, as is observed in the case of <i>PINK1 parkin</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clark et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Park et al., 2006</a>). Conversely, if <i>MUL1</i> and <i>PINK1/parkin</i> act in parallel pathways, the phenotypes of double null mutants may be stronger than those of single mutants."

                                "text": "We generated <i>PINK1 MUL1</i> and <i>parkin MUL1</i> double mutants<i>.</i> Several lines of evidence show that double mutants have significantly enhanced phenotypes as compared to those of single mutants alone. First, <i>PINK1 MUL1</i> and <i>parkin MUL1</i> double null mutants show a high frequency of pupal lethality as compared with single mutants (data not shown), while double null mutants of <i>PINK1 parkin</i> have the same level of viability as single mutants (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clark et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Park et al., 2006</a>). Second, a thoracic indentation observed in <i>PINK1</i> or <i>parkin</i> null mutants is much more severe in <i>PINK1 MUL1</i> and <i>parkin MUL1</i> double null mutants. In contrast, <i>PINK1 parkin</i> double null mutants show the same degree of thoracic indentation as <i>PINK1</i> or <i>parkin</i> single mutants alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013G</a>). Third, at the cellular level, <i>PINK1 MUL1</i> and <i>parkin MUL1</i> double null mutants have highly elongated and interconnected mitochondria, as determined using anti-mitochondrial ATPase antibodies. These mitochondrial phenotypes are very different from those of <i>PINK1</i>, <i>parkin</i>, or <i>MUL1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I\u2013O</a>). <i>PINK1 parkin</i> double null mutants show similar mitochondrial morphology phenotypes as <i>PINK1</i> or <i>parkin</i> single mutants alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5O</a> vs <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J,M</a>). Fourth, ATP levels in <i>parkin MUL1</i> double null mutants were further reduced compared to those of <i>parkin</i> or <i>MUL1</i> single null mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Q</a>). Fifth, the ability of <i>parkin</i> overexpression to rescue <i>PINK1</i> mutants is not dependent on <i>MUL1</i>, and <i>MUL1</i> overexpression can still suppress <i>PINK1</i> mutants in the absence of <i>parkin</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Sixth, knockdown of both <i>MUL1</i> and <i>parkin</i> in S2 cells further reduces Mfn ubiquitination below levels seen with knockdown of <i>MUL1</i> or <i>parkin</i> alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5R</a>). Seventh, <i>PINK1 MUL1</i> and <i>parkin MUL1</i> double null mutants have higher Mfn levels as compared to single null mutants of <i>MUL1</i>, <i>PINK1</i>, or <i>parkin</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Finally, knockdown of <i>mfn</i> in the background of <i>parkin MUL1</i> double mutants almost completely rescues the thoracic indentation and mitochondrial phenotypes of <i>parkin MUL1</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,P</a>). These genetic observations, in combination with biochemical findings that MUL1 physically interacts with Mfn, and that loss of <i>MUL1</i> results in decreased ubiquitination of endogenous Mfn and increased Mfn levels, indicate that <i>MUL1</i> acts in parallel to the <i>PINK1/parkin</i> pathway to regulate a common target Mfn."

Wild-type, <i>MUL1</i> knockout, and <i>PINK1</i> knockout (as a control) HeLa cells were transfected with YFP-Parkin and treated with DMSO or antimycin A for indicated time. In wild-type, without antimycin A treatment, Parkin mainly localizes in the cytosol (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). However, following antimycin A treatment for 3 hrs, most Parkin was translocated to the mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,D</a>). After 24 hrs of antimycin A treatment, Parkin was found dispersed in the cytosol and mitochondria were no longer observed, indicating that mitophagy had occurred (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,E</a>). To ensure there was no delay in mitophagy, we also assayed cells that were treated with antimycin A for 6, 12, 16 and 20 hrs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>, data not shown). In all cells, mitophagy was observed at least 16 hrs after antimycin A treatment.

The mechanism of this suppression is unique in that <i>MUL1</i> does not act on <i>PINK1</i> or <i>parkin</i>, nor does it function as a downstream target. Rather, <i>MUL1</i> acts by suppressing <i>mfn</i> in parallel to the <i>PINK1/parkin</i> pathway (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). <i>mfn</i> is crucial for actions downstream of <i>PINK1/parkin</i> to maintain mitochondrial function and tissue health (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), as overexpression of <i>mfn</i> leads to pathology similar to lack of <i>PINK1/parkin</i> function. We hypothesize that the increase in the Mfn level needs to reach a threshold, such as that observed in the <i>PINK1/parkin</i> mutant backgrounds, but not in the <i>MUL1</i> null background, in order for overt muscle cell degeneration to occur (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Biochemically, MUL1 binds to Mfn, and loss of <i>MUL1</i> results in decreased ubiquitination of Mfn and increased Mfn levels. These observations suggest that MUL1 may directly ubiquitinate Mfn, leading to its degradation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>)<i>.</i> Alternatively, MUL1 may act via an intermediary that promotes Mfn ubiquitination and degradation. In <i>Drosophila</i>, overexpression of <i>MUL1</i> almost completely suppresses all aspects of the <i>PINK1/parkin</i> null phenotypes. Thus, treatments that manipulate <i>MUL1</i> expression or activity may have potential as therapeutics strategies."

In mammalian cells, upon mitochondrial damage (CCCP or antimycin A treatment), PINK1 is stabilized onto the mitochondrial OM of damaged mitochondria, with its kinase domain facing the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib68\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>). PINK1 recruits Parkin onto the OM, either through direct phosphorylation or indirect interaction with other proteins (not depicted here) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jin and Youle, 2012</a>). Parkin then ubiquitinates multiple substrates on the OM, including Mfn. MUL1, a mitochondrial OM-anchored ligase with its RNF domain facing the cytosol, also mediates ubiquitination of Mitofusin. (<b>B</b>) The <i>PINK1/parkin</i> pathway and <i>MUL1</i> act in parallel to regulate <i>mfn</i>, and maintain mitochondrial function and tissue health. Reducing either <i>PINK1/parkin</i> or <i>MUL1</i> leads to increased levels of Mfn. Significant elevation of Mfn leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and tissue damage, similar to what is observed in <i>PINK1/parkin</i> mutants. Loss of both <i>PINK1/parkin</i> and <i>MUL1</i> leads to significantly higher Mfn levels, associated with severe mitochondrial dysfunction and tissue damage.

Removal of <i>MUL1</i> in the <i>PINK1</i> or <i>parkin</i> null background significantly aggravates the phenotypes due to lack of <i>PINK1 or parkin</i> alone.

In addition, while <i>parkin</i> KO mature mouse cortical neurons or <i>MUL1</i> knockdown neurons show only mild neuronal phenotypes, neurons with <i>parkin</i> KO and <i>MUL1</i> KD show significantly diminished mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction. They also show neurodegeneration-like phenotypes including axonal and dendritic fragmentation, and reduced mitochondrial distribution along processes.

Mfn is localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>) and is a key molecule that regulates mitochondrial fusion in response to various cellular processes. Due to its importance, the level of Mfn is expected to be tightly regulated, and this may require several E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases that respond to different stimuli (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gegg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Park et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Leboucher et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lokireddy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Anton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fu et al., 2013</a>). In the case of mitochondrial damage, Parkin translocates to depolarized mitochondria before it degrades Mfn (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), thus preventing damaged mitochondria from fusing with healthy ones. As an E3 ligase anchored on the OM (<a href=\"#bib38\">Li et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), MUL1 is constantly present in the vicinity of Mfn, thus mediating Mfn clearance either constitutively or in a regulated manner in response to different stress signals. It is also possible that multiple E3 ligases work in a concerted way to ensure constant Mfn levels. In our study, CHX treatment leads to the stabilization of Mfn levels in HeLa cells lack of <i>MUL1</i>. However, steady-state Mfn levels in these cells are not strongly affected. This may result from the existence of other pathways for Mfn regulation, such as direct transcriptional feedback regulation on Mfn expression, activities of deubquitinases, and additional E3 ligases. Similar considerations may explain the viability and apparently mild phenotypes of <i>MUL1</i> mutant flies. More severe phenotypes may be uncovered in flies lacking <i>MUL1</i> in response to specific stresses that cannot be buffered by other components."

To monitor mitophagy, this study measured mitochondrial DNA content and emission of a mitochondrial fluorescent protein that changes color in an acidic environment such as the lysosome (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lokireddy et al., 2012</a>). However, since these methods do not directly visualize mitochondrial fate, it is possible that the observations may reflect early signs of mitochondrial dysfunction or turnover of the indicator protein, rather than clearance of the mitochondria. Also, it is unknown whether <i>MUL1</i> interacts with the <i>PINK1/parkin</i> pathway to regulate the mitochondrial clearance. Our results show that overexpression or lack of <i>MUL1</i> does not affect Parkin-mediated mitophagy induced by mitochondrial damage in HeLa cells. This further strengthens our hypothesis that <i>MUL1</i> acts in <i>PINK1/parkin</i>-independent pathway for regulating mitochondrial quality control."

In this regard, it is worth noting that MUL1 forms a complex with VPS35 and VPS26 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Braschi et al., 2010</a>). Since mutations in <i>VPS35</i> have been identified in multiple PD families (<a href=\"#bib62\">Vilarino-Guell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Zimprich et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kumar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lesage et al., 2012</a>), it will be particularly interesting to determine if PD-associated mutations in <i>VPS35</i> have effects on <i>MUL1</i>-dependent degradation of Mfn. Finally, our observation that overexpression of <i>mfn</i> alone is sufficient to recapitulate key phenotypes associated with loss of <i>PINK1</i> or <i>parkin</i> suggests that inhibition of <i>mfn</i> may have important therapeutic potential for PD."

Dissection of embryonic mouse brains and isolation of cortical neurons and plating were designed to be very quick with minimal enzymatic, mechanical, chemical, and oxidative damage, as described by <a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al. (2012)</a>. Cortices were dissected from E18-19 mouse embryos. Cortical neurons were dissociated by papain (Worthington) and plated on glial beds at a density of 50,000 cells per cm<sup>2</sup> on polyornithine (Sigma) and Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated coverslips. Neurons were grown overnight in plating medium (5% FBS, insulin, glutamate, G5, 1 x B27 and beta-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 100 x L-glutamine in Neurobasal (Invitrogen). Starting at DIV2, cultures were maintained in conditioned medium with half-feed changes of neuronal feed (1 \u00d7 B27, 100 \u00d7 L-glutamine and beta-mercaptoethanol in Neurobasal) every 3 days. Neurons were transfected with various constructs at DIV7-8 using calcium phosphate and processed for immunocytochemistry 72 hr (DIV10-11) post transfection."

Fixed cultures were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS with 1% BSA and 0.05% saponin at 4\u00b0C overnight. Cells were washed four times with PBS at RT for 5 min each, incubated with secondary fluorescent antibodies at 1:400 dilution in PBS with 1% BSA and 0.05% saponin for 60 min, re-washed with PBS, and then mounted with Fluoro-Gel anti-fade mounting medium (EMS) for imaging. Sources of antibodies are as follow: polyclonal antibodies against TOM20 (Santa Cruz), MUL1 (Sigma), Mfn2 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); monoclonal antibodies against MAP2 (Millipore), GAPDH (Research Diagnostic, Hackensack, NJ), CytC (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA); Alexafluor 546 and 633-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Confocal images were obtained using an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 microscope, oil immersion 63X objective (NA-1.45) with sequential-acquisition settings. Images were acquired using the same settings below saturation at a resolution of 1024X1024 pixels (12 bit). Z stacks were acquired using a step size of 0.37 \u00b5m from top to bottom, and brightest point projections were made. For quantification, data were obtained from at least three independent experiments and the number of cells used for quantification is indicated in the figures. All statistical analyses were performed using One-way or Two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test and are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM."

Five to six sections were taken from the top-to-bottom of the specimen and brightest point projections were made. Morphometric measurements were performed using NIH ImageJ. Measured data were imported into Excel software for analysis. The thresholds in all images were set to similar levels. Fluorescence intensity of TMRE was expressed in corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) values. The mean intensity of TMRE in the soma of each group was normalized as a percentile ratio relative to that in WT cells expressing scrambled shRNA.

Furthermore, <i>Mul1</i> loss exacerbates the phenotype of Parkin loss. The loss of <i>Mul1</i> is clearly shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> to make the loss of <i>Parkin/Pink1</i> mutant flies worse, which indicates they work by different mechanisms. However, this is not surprising \u2013 many mutations in flies will cause stress by different paths and exacerbate one another's phenotype. Therefore, the key issue is whether or not both <i>Mul1</i> and <i>Parkin</i> function by inducing the ubiquitination and elimination of mitofusin. <i>Mul1</i> decreases the expression level of Mfn1 but this may be indirect and cell free experiments could conclusively show <i>Mul1</i> ubiquitinates Mfn. However, cell free experiments seems to be beyond the scope of this manuscript. Why would increased Mfn level lead to the mitochondrial and cellular defects? Is this through decreased mitophagy? If not mitophagy what? MUL1 is not likely expressed simply to statically reduce the steady state level of Mfn. How MUL1 is regulated and why and when it ubiquitinates MFn (if it is direct) remains unexplored. Although there are clearly mysteries here, this is a very thorough genetic study with intriguing conclusions in need of only minor corrections."

In the present manuscript, Yun et al. uncover a parallel pathway to PINK1/parkin acting through MUL1. Both pathways converge on a shared target mitofusin to maintain mitochondrial integrity in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals. Recently, MUL1 was identified as a novel regulator of mitochondrial fission by activation of Drp1 through sumolyation and degradation of MFN1 and MFN2 through ubiquitination. In this manuscript the authors provide genetic evidence that MUL1 is required for mitofusin turnover in <i>Drosophila</i> and human cell lines. Moreover, MUL1 overexpression can suppress phenotypes associated with pink and parkin mutants through mitofusin degradation, suggesting a compensatory role for MUL1. As <i>Pink1/Parkin</i> also ubiquitinate mitofusin, they decided to test if MUL1 and <i>Pink1/Parkin</i> act in the same pathway. Double mutant of MUL1 with either <i>PINK1</i> or <i>parkin</i> have a more severe phenotype than the single mutants, which suggests that MUL1 and <i>Pink1/Parkin</i> act in parallel pathways.

We have made repeated attempts to carry out this experiment in mammalian cells, using both anti-MUL1 and anti-Mitofusin antibodies. However, we have not been able to detect consistent binding between the endogenous proteins. It is possible that the interaction is too weak or transient, and that it therefore evades detection in our system, even though we can detect interactions between the two proteins when both are overexpressed."

While this state of affairs is not ideal, and it is not our preferred form of rebuttal, it does highlight what may be a general difficulty in detecting interactions between endogenous Mfn and other proteins. This has not prevented people in the field, including us, from concluding that Parkin binds to Mfn."
