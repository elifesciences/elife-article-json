In                    Huntington's disease (HD) action suppression is impaired, resembling the effects                    of STN lesioning or inactivation. To explore this potential linkage, the STN was                    studied in BAC transgenic and Q175 knock-in mouse models of HD. At &lt; 2 and 6                    months of age autonomous STN activity was impaired due to activation of                        K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. STN neurons exhibited prolonged NMDA                    receptor-mediated synaptic currents, caused by a deficit in glutamate uptake,                    and elevated mitochondrial oxidant stress, which was ameliorated by NMDA                    receptor antagonism. STN activity was rescued by NMDA receptor antagonism or                    breakdown of hydrogen peroxide. At 12 months of age approximately 30% of STN                    neurons were lost, as in HD. Together these data argue that dysfunction within                    the STN is an early feature of HD that may contribute to its expression and                    course."
