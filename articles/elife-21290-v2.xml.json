We determined the structure of supercomplex I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>1</sub> from bovine heart mitochondria by cryo-EM at 9 \u00c5 resolution. Most protein-protein contacts between complex I, III and IV in the membrane are mediated by supernumerary subunits. Of the two Rieske iron-sulfur cluster domains in the complex III dimer, one is resolved, indicating that this domain is immobile and unable to transfer electrons. The central position of the active complex III monomer between complex I and IV in the respirasome is optimal for accepting reduced quinone from complex I over a short diffusion distance of 11 nm, and delivering reduced cytochrome <i>c</i> to complex IV. The functional asymmetry of complex III provides strong evidence for directed electron flow from complex I to complex IV through the active complex III monomer in the mammalian supercomplex."

We determined the structure of supercomplex I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>1</sub> from bovine heart mitochondria by cryo-EM at 9 \u00c5 resolution. Most protein-protein contacts between complex I, III and IV in the membrane are mediated by supernumerary subunits. Of the two Rieske iron-sulfur cluster domains in the complex III dimer, one is resolved, indicating that this domain is immobile and unable to transfer electrons. The central position of the active complex III monomer between complex I and IV in the respirasome is optimal for accepting reduced quinone from complex I over a short diffusion distance of 11 nm, and delivering reduced cytochrome <i>c</i> to complex IV. The functional asymmetry of complex III provides strong evidence for directed electron flow from complex I to complex IV through the active complex III monomer in the mammalian supercomplex."

Their central role is to provide energy to the cell in the form of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. The mitochondrial respiratory chain consists of four complexes (I\u2013IV), which transfer electrons from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen. A part of the energy gained in electron transfer is used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The resulting proton gradient is utilized by the mitochondrial ATP synthase to generate ATP. The respiratory chain complexes reside mostly, if not entirely, in the mitochondrial cristae (<a href=\"#bib30\">K\u00fchlbrandt, 2015</a>), which are deep invaginations of the inner membrane into the matrix."

Mammalian complex I comprises 44 different subunits, including two copies of subunit SDAP, and therefore consists of a total of 45 subunits (<a href=\"#bib62\">Vinothkumar et al., 2014</a>). The 14 core subunits are conserved from prokaryotes to mammals (<a href=\"#bib63\">Walker, 1992</a>). The characteristic L-shape of complex I arises from the association of three different units. The dehydrogenase and hydrogenase-like units constitute the matrix arm and are responsible for the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sazanov and Hinchliffe, 2006</a>). As a third unit, the membrane-embedded transporter assembly pumps four protons from the matrix to the cristae lumen per catalytic cycle (<a href=\"#bib18\">Galkin and Terenetskaya, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Leif et al., 1995</a>). Succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, or complex II, is the only complex in the electron transfer chain that does not translocate protons, but merely feeds electrons into the process. The cytochrome <i>bc</i><sub>1</sub> complex (complex III) is a symmetrical dimer, with cytochrome <i>b</i>, the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> as core subunits (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yang and Trumpower, 1986</a>). The Rieske subunit extends across both monomers, stabilizing the dimer that is essential for function. In mammals, complex III contains a total of 11 subunits per monomer, of which eight are supernumerary (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sch\u00e4gger et al., 1986</a>). Complex III transfers electrons from ubiquinone to cytochrome <i>c</i>, a small soluble electron carrier protein in the cristae lumen. Finally, cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase, also known as complex IV, transfers electrons from cytochrome <i>c</i> and catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Mammalian complex IV has three core subunits (COX1, COX2 and COX3) and 14 subunits in total (<a href=\"#bib4\">Balsa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kadenbach et al., 1983</a>)."

For many years it was assumed that the respiratory chain complexes exist as separate units in the fluid lipid bilayer of the inner membrane and interact by random collision (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hackenbrock et al., 1986</a>). The discovery of supercomplexes by blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) after solubilization with mild detergents (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sch\u00e4gger and Pfeiffer, 2000</a>) gave rise to the plasticity model, which postulates that respiratory complexes can exist both free in the membrane and as larger supramolecular entities (<a href=\"#bib2\">Acin-Perez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">D'Aurelio et al., 2006</a>). Since then, several stoichiometric supercomplexes have been identified, amongst which the respirasome (supercomplex I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>1</sub>) is the most prominent. The respirasome contains all components required to transfer electrons from NADH to molecular oxygen (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sch\u00e4gger and Pfeiffer, 2000</a>)."

At the functional level, advantages due to partitioning of the quinol pool and substrate channeling have been postulated and are supported by several independent studies (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bianchi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013</a>). Other results are inconsistent with a partitioning of the quinol pool (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blaza et al., 2014</a>). A reduction in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated as side products of electron transfer reactions in the respiratory chain has also been suggested as a possible role (<a href=\"#bib40\">Maranzana et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Panov et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Seelert et al., 2009</a>). From the point of view of protein structure, supercomplexes have been proposed to confer stability to complex I or assist in its assembly (<a href=\"#bib41\">Marques et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Sch\u00e4gger et al., 2004</a>). In line with this, a model for the generation of supercomplexes was proposed, where the assembly of catalytic subunits of the complex I NADH:dehydrogenase module occurs at a late stage to activate the supercomplexes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Moreno-Lastres et al., 2012</a>). However, recent complexome profiling studies failed to detect supercomplexes containing immature complex I, suggesting that the respirasome forms by association of fully assembled component complexes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guerrero-Castillo et al., 2016</a>)."

The secondary loss of complex I upon impaired expression of complexes III and IV has been taken to mean that complex I stability depends on physical interaction with other complexes in the respiratory chain, since pharmacological inhibition was not sufficient to reduce complex I levels to the same extent (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acin-Perez et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Diaz et al., 2006</a>). Recent studies suggest however that low levels of cytochrome <i>bc</i><sub>1</sub> and cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (as well as cytochrome <i>c</i>) result in an accumulation of reduced quinone, which would trigger reverse electron transfer (RET) and generation of superoxide by complex I. This could result in oxidative damage and complex I degradation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guaras et al., 2016</a>). When ROS production by RET was inhibited, complex I levels were restored (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guaras et al., 2016</a>)."

However, the map resolution was insufficient to fit the component complexes precisely, or to detect new functionally relevant features. Moreover, the recently published high-resolution cryo-EM structures of bovine complex I (<a href=\"#bib62\">Vinothkumar et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhu et al., 2016</a>) contribute to a comprehensive view of the respirasome.

Classes 1 and 2 are related by a 25\u00b0 rigid-body rotation of the whole complex III dimer relative to complex I, around an axis roughly perpendicular to the membrane plane. This rotation breaks the protein-protein contacts of complex III with complexes I and IV observed in class 1. The particles that cluster in class 2 therefore appear to represent a different form of the respirasome. There were no significant new interactions between complex III and complexes I and IV in this class, implying that it may be less stable. In class 2, the matrix arm of complex I has moved away from the center of the supercomplex by a rotation of 3\u20134\u00b0 around an axis parallel to the membrane (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Structures of active and deactive states of complex I have been recently presented, which differ by a similar movement of the matrix arm (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhu et al., 2016</a>). Class 2 may thus represent a subpopulation of the supercomplex in which complex I is in the deactive state. Alternatively, class 2 may result from rearrangement or destabilization of the supercomplex during purification. The mutual arrangement of complexes I and III in class 3 is the same as in class 1, confirming that the interaction between these two proteins is sufficiently stable to fix them in this specific conformation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>)."

While these classes might reflect a partial loss of this module during purification or cryo-EM grid preparation, we cannot rule out the possibility that they represent biologically relevant assembly, disassembly or recycling intermediates of the respirasome. A recent study of respirasome biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib45\">Moreno-Lastres et al., 2012</a>) has suggested that supercomplexes form by association of individual subunits of the respiratory complexes or their intermediate assemblies, rather than from the fully assembled respiratory chain complexes. The incorporation of the NADH:dehydrogenase module of complex I has been presented as the final step in the assembly process (<a href=\"#bib45\">Moreno-Lastres et al., 2012</a>). The study reported a significant delay in the integration of the 51\u2009kDa subunit in this module, which is one of the core subunits of the N-catalytic unit of complex I. These observations are in agreement with our 8.1\u2009\u00c5 global average (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>), in which the density for the 51\u2009kDa subunit is weak and could explain why the NADH:dehydrogenase module is absent in several of the 3D class averages (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The iron-sulfur domain is the active part of the Rieske protein subunit of the <i>bc</i><sub>1</sub> complex that carries electrons from the Q<sub>P</sub> site via its iron-sulfur cluster to heme <i>c</i><sub>1</sub>, where they are picked up by the small, soluble cytochrome <i>c</i> protein for transfer to complex IV (<a href=\"#bib30\">K\u00fchlbrandt, 2015</a>). Interestingly, the iron-sulfur domain that bridges the gap in the electron transfer path between the hemes of one complex III monomer belongs to the Rieske protein of the opposite monomer. In order to transfer electrons to <i>c</i><sub>1</sub>, the iron-sulfur domain has to move on a hinge by 10\u201315\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Iwata et al., 1998</a>). Such a movement would make the iron-sulfur domain invisible in a 9\u2009\u00c5 map. The hinge movement of the iron-sulfur domain is essential for function since when it is blocked, no electrons are transferred to cytochrome <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Darrouzet et al., 2000</a>). The fact that one of the two iron-sulfur domains in the supercomplex is resolved means that one of the two complex III monomers is inactive. The inactive monomer is the one in contact with the well-defined iron-sulfur domain. This monomer is exposed to the lipid bilayer on most of its periphery, except for the hydrophobic surface area that is involved in complex III dimer formation. The active monomer near the disordered iron-sulfur domain is surrounded by complex I, complex IV and the inactive complex III monomer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

At present we do not know what constrains the movement of one of the two iron sulfur domains in the supercomplex.

In single particle cryo-EM conformational changes are not subject to such contacts. Therefore, in the absence of inhibitors, and in light of the known mechanism of electron transfer, a cryo-EM map of complex III should reveal two equally unresolved iron-sulfur domains, as a result of averaging particles in different states. In our map, only one iron-sulfur domain is unresolved, and hence active. The observed asymmetry is thus incompatible with an alternating activation of the two complex III monomers and implies that each monomer has a different function. Our data suggest that in the respirasome, the central monomer of complex III preferentially catalyzes quinol oxidation. As electrons can equilibrate rapidly between the two <i>b</i><sub>L</sub> hemes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Castellani et al., 2010</a>), quinone reduction may occur in either monomer, although it is possible that the distal monomer has no function, except as a scaffold."

The shortest distance between the two sites is about 11 nm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The quinol oxidation site of the inactive monomer is on the far side of the dimer, at a distance of at least 18 nm from the complex I site, assuming that the quinol cannot pass through the complex III dimer. A quinol diffusing through the lipid bilayer from complex I to complex III would thus encounter the active monomer first. The linear arrangement of complex I, the active complex III monomer and complex IV in the respirasome seems to be particularly favourable for efficient substrate and electron transfer. Significantly, only one of the complex III monomers is well-placed to accept reduced quinol from complex I, which may explain why only this monomer is active. Substrate channeling within the respirasome has been extensively debated. Results inconsistent with the existence of distinct quinone pools and substrate channeling have been reported (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blaza et al., 2014</a>), but substrate channeling between complexes I and III is supported by most studies of metabolic flux control (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bianchi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013</a>) and in recent reviews discussing the results of Blaza et al (<a href=\"#bib17\">Enr\u00edquez, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lenaz et al., 2016</a>).

These studies used mitochondria from porcine or ovine, rather than bovine, heart. The ovine complex I has been described as being particularly stable and suitable for structural studies (<a href=\"#bib36\">Letts et al., 2016a</a>) and the same most likely holds true for supercomplexes. At resolutions of 5\u20136\u2009\u00c5, both structures corroborate most of the protein-protein contacts we observe in the bovine complex. Several additional subunits were found to participate in the stabilization of the supercomplex, which were not clearly visible at our map resolution. A detailed comparison is possible only for the ovine complex, since neither the map nor the coordinates of the porcine supercomplex have been released."

The two states are referred to as the tight and loose conformation. The tight conformation of the ovine complex is essentially identical to class 1 of the bovine respirasome, but the arrangement of component complexes in the loose state differs considerably from our class 2. In the bovine respirasome, complex III rotates by 25\u00b0 relative to complex I, while the position of complex IV remains unchanged. In contrast, in the loose ovine respirasome, complex IV swings away from complex III. Complex III rotates in the same direction as in our class 2, but to a lesser extent. In both the bovine and the ovine respirasome, interactions between complex III and IV are disrupted in these minor classes. In the case of the ovine complex, the proportion of particles in the loose state was found to increase with time (<a href=\"#bib37\">Letts et al., 2016b</a>). This suggests that the loose state of the ovine respirasome and our class 2 of the bovine complex result from incipient denaturation during and after purification. The differences observed between these two classes most likely reflect different degrees of respirasome instability, which may be species-specific, or due to differences in supercomplex purification."

Therefore neither of the two other structures shows a mobile and therefore catalytically active Rieske protein, as we observe in the bovine respirasome. Letts et al propose that due to the close proximity between complex IV and the Rieske protein of the outer monomer of complex III, the iron-sulfur domain of the outer complex III monomer cannot undergo the conformational changes required for electron transfer. This is consistent with our findings, although neither structure shows any direct protein-protein contacts that would inhibit domain movements. Letts et al conclude that quinone oxidation is likely to take place in the central complex III monomer. This agrees with our model, which is however based on firm experimental evidence of an unresolved, and hence mobile, iron-sulfur domain. Letts et al also propose that quinone reduction in complex III should be catalyzed by the distal monomer; however the respirasome structures provide no evidence for this. Further studies should clarify the exact transfer path of electrons and quinol substrates through the mammalian respirasome."

The ordered structure of one of the two iron-sulfur domains in the complex III dimer indicates that, contrary to expectation, one of the two electron transfer pathways in complex III is always active, whereas the other monomer is inactive. The active complex III monomer is in a pivotal position between the quinol binding site of complex I and the cytochrome <i>c</i> binding site of complex IV, and hence for directed electron flow through the respirasome. Far from being a random collection of close-packed respiratory chain complexes, the mitochondrial respirasome has not only a clear role for the long-term stability of its component complexes, in particular complex I, but also in optimizing electron flow in cellular respiration."

Its principal conclusion concerns a functional asymmetry: one of the iron-sulfur clusters is docked in such a way that electrons cannot be transferred, because the distance to the partner is too great. The authors conclude that one of the two is inactive. The structure is well determined at the stated resolution, but two structures at much higher resolution appeared after this manuscript was submitted. The reviewers request a revised manuscript that places the current conclusions in the context of those reports. In particular, the authors should address the likelihood of a different interpretation \u2013 some sort of alternating access model in which only one subunit can access the transfer site at a time, while the other docks in the observed, autoinhibited position. That is, the statement that the resolved Rieske center is immobile and therefore not functional is one possibility, but just because it has a fixed orientation in this structure of the inactive respirasome does not mean it cannot move in the active respirasome."

The historical origin of this proposal is as follows: in 2004 two groups independently proposed that CI stability was compromised in the absence of CIII (Acin-Perez et al., 2004 &amp; Sch\u00e4gger et al. 2004). Latter, the group of Carlos Moraes demonstrated that ablation of CIV or cyt <i>c</i>, also compromised the stability of CI (Diaz et al. 2006- Mol Cell Biol 26, 4872-4881 &amp; Vempati, et al. 2009. J. Biol. Chem. 284, 4383-4391). More recently it was demonstrated that CI can be assembled functionally in the absence of CIII, CIV or cyt <i>c</i> by recovering the re-oxidation of CoQ (Guar\u00e1s, 2016. Cell Reports 15, 197-209). This series of reports led to the conclusion that assembly of the individual respiratory complexes can proceed independently and requires neither the presence of other complexes nor interaction with them. In line with this conclusion, kinetic analysis showed that the formation of complexes happened before the formation of supercomplexes (Ac\u00edn-Per\u00e9z et al. 2008. Mol. Cell 32, 529-539). This result does not preclude, however, that incomplete CI or CIII could interact with other complexes and form supercomplexes, as reported by several groups (Marques, I., 2007. Eukaryotic Cell 6, 2391-2405). In 2012 it was proposed that the assembly of the NADH-DH module of CI require that formation of a non-functional respirasome between partially assembled CI with CIII and CIV (Moreno-Lastres et al. 2012. Cell Metab.15, 324-335). This proposal contradicted that of (Ac\u00edn-Per\u00e9z et al. 2008. Mol. Cell 32, 529-539). A very recent reevaluation concluded that CI, CIII and CIV are fully assembled before they associate into supercomplexes, refuting the proposal by Moreno-Lastres (Guerrero-Castillo S, Baertling F, Kownatzki D., Wessels H.J., Arnold S., Brandt U. and Nijtmans L. 2016. Cell Metab, in press)."

The authors should be aware that different detergents generate different micelles containing the SCs and modify their electrophoretic motility. In this sense <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> does not help very much, since CIV is not detected in the first dimension in some of the samples (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) while it is detected in others (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and in the second dimension almost all the CIV seemed to be present as free complex. In addition, the authors find I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub> by cryo-electron microscopy analysis in sufficient quantity to propose its structure (subsection \u201cDefined protein-protein contacts\u201d, first paragraph). They justify that observation by assuming that I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub> is an artefact generated in vitro by cleavage of I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>2</sub> (in the second paragraph of the aforementioned subsection). This could be the explanation, but it is also possible that they co-purified both, but their detergent did not resolve them in a gel. In fact, they do not report the observation of free CIV that has to be present if the cleavage happened after purification. Finally, if the authors are interested in identifying properly the different components of the bands obtained with the new detergent they should use immunodetection approaches rather than Coomassie staining. There are good antibodies for that purpose."

Contrary to the argument given for the unexpected observation of I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub> without IV, they do not consider these new classes as an artefact of the manipulation. Rather they propose that represent intermediates of supercomplex assembly, potentially in agreement with those postulated by Moreno-Lastres et al. (subsection \u201cConformational and compositional variability\u201d, last paragraph). The model of for the assembly of CI and SCs proposed by Moreno-Lastres has been questioned, however (see above). Moreover, two different groups proposed that CI damage occurred under natural conditions at the NADH:DH module, and that this can be replaced without the elimination of the rest of the complex (Lazarou, et al. 2007. Mol Cell Biol 27, 4228-4237. Dieteren, et al. 2012 J. Biol. Chem 287, 41851-41860). If so, the observed structures could also be consistent with the prediction of Lazarou and Dieteren and might have come from degradation rather than as assembly intermediates. The data in this manuscript cannot determine whether those structures are natural or artefactual and whether they might represent intermediates of synthesis or degradation. The reviewer's suggestion is to present either all the potential alternative explanations or to simply remove the discussion of the nature of this structures. In particular, the suggestion that complex III acts as an assembly factor for CI (subsection \u201cSupercomplex assembly, complex I stability and human health\u201d, first paragraph) is not justified by the results presented nor by most of the recent literature."

The linear arrangement of complex I, the active complex III monomer and complex IV in the respirasome seems to be particularly favourable for efficient substrate and electron transfer.\" This is confusing, because the statements appear to be contradictory. On the one hand, the authors propose that the respirasome has a particular defined structure that favors oxidization of quinol not only the by CIII incorporated into the respirasome but also by a defined monomer. In the other, they state that this does not imply a kind of channeling. The reviewer believes that their proposed model entails preferential reduction of the ubiquinol within the respirasome rather than a more stochastic picture."

The historical origin of this proposal is as follows: in 2004 two groups independently proposed that CI stability was compromised in the absence of CIII (Acin-Perez et al., 2004 &amp; Sch\u00e4gger et al. 2004). Latter, the group of Carlos Moraes demonstrated that ablation of CIV or cyt c, also compromised the stability of CI (Diaz et al. 2006- Mol Cell Biol 26, 4872-4881 &amp; Vempati, et al. 2009. J. Biol. Chem. 284, 4383-4391). More recently it was demonstrated that CI can be assembled functionally in the absence of CIII, CIV or cyt c by recovering the re-oxidation of CoQ (Guar\u00e1s, 2016. Cell Reports 15, 197-209). This series of reports led to the conclusion that assembly of the individual respiratory complexes can proceed independently and requires neither the presence of other complexes nor interaction with them. In line with this conclusion, kinetic analysis showed that the formation of complexes happened before the formation of supercomplexes (Ac\u00edn-Per\u00e9z et al. 2008. Mol. Cell 32, 529-539). This result does not preclude, however, that incomplete CI or CIII could interact with other complexes and form supercomplexes, as reported by several groups (Marques, I., 2007. Eukaryotic Cell 6, 2391-2405). In 2012 it was proposed that the assembly of the NADH-DH module of CI require that formation of a non-functional respirasome between partially assembled CI with CIII and CIV (Moreno-Lastres et al. 2012. Cell Metab.15, 324-335). This proposal contradicted that of (Ac\u00edn-Per\u00e9z et al. 2008. Mol. Cell 32, 529-539). A very recent reevaluation concluded that CI, CIII and CIV are fully assembled before they associate into supercomplexes, refuting the proposal by Moreno-Lastres (Guerrero-Castillo S, Baertling F, Kownatzki D., Wessels H.J., Arnold S., Brandt U. and Nijtmans L. 2016.

Mol Cell Biol 27, 4228-4237. Dieteren, et al. 2012 J. Biol. Chem 287, 41851-41860). If so, the observed structures could also be consistent with the predicition of Lazarou and Dieteren and might have come from degradation rather than as assembly intermediates. The data in this manuscript cannot determine whether those structures are natural or artefactual and whether they might represent intermediates of synthesis or degradation. The reviewer's suggestion is to present either all the potential alternative explanations or to simply remove the discussion of the nature of this structures.
