To dissect Pol II dynamics in mouse ES cells, we inhibited Pol II transcription at either initiation or promoter-proximal pause escape with Triptolide or Flavopiridol, and tracked Pol II kinetically using GRO-seq. Both inhibitors block transcription of more than 95% of genes, showing that pause escape, like initiation, is a ubiquitous and crucial step within the transcription cycle. Moreover, paused Pol II is relatively stable, as evidenced from half-life measurements at \u223c3200 genes. Finally, tracking the progression of Pol II after drug treatment establishes Pol II elongation rates at over 1000 genes. Notably, Pol II accelerates dramatically while transcribing through genes, but slows at exons. Furthermore, intergenic variance in elongation rates is substantial, and is influenced by a positive effect of H3K79me2 and negative effects of exon density and CG content within genes."

To dissect Pol II dynamics in mouse ES cells, we inhibited Pol II transcription at either initiation or promoter-proximal pause escape with Triptolide or Flavopiridol, and tracked Pol II kinetically using GRO-seq. Both inhibitors block transcription of more than 95% of genes, showing that pause escape, like initiation, is a ubiquitous and crucial step within the transcription cycle. Moreover, paused Pol II is relatively stable, as evidenced from half-life measurements at \u223c3200 genes. Finally, tracking the progression of Pol II after drug treatment establishes Pol II elongation rates at over 1000 genes. Notably, Pol II accelerates dramatically while transcribing through genes, but slows at exons. Furthermore, intergenic variance in elongation rates is substantial, and is influenced by a positive effect of H3K79me2 and negative effects of exon density and CG content within genes."

Transcription rates were, however, shown to vary between different genes\u2014highly active genes are transcribed faster. Transcription rates also varied within individual genes, with the enzyme accelerating as it moves along the gene.

After initiation of Pol II, transcription regulation is mediated mostly by the dynamics of Pol II elongation. For example, +20 to 100 nts downstream of the transcription start site (TSS), Pol II can be slowed down and paused by negative elongation factor (NELF), DRB-sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) and core promoter components (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman and Lis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kwak et al., 2013</a>). The escape of Pol II from the paused state into productive elongation can be rate-limiting, and is dependent on the positive elongation factor P-TEFb, which consists of the Cdk9 kinase and CyclinT1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marshall et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lis et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ni et al., 2008</a>). P-TEFb is recruited directly or indirectly to the paused Pol II complex by transcription activators, where it phosphorylates the C-Terminal domain (CTD), as well as DSIF and NELF, transforming DSIF into a positive elongation factor and evicting NELF (<a href=\"#bib46\">Peterlin and Price, 2006</a>). P-TEFb appears to be both necessary and sufficient for paused Pol II escape into productive elongation; blocking P-TEFb kinase activity with the drug flavopiridol (FP) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chao and Price, 2001</a>) in <i>Drosophila</i> causes an increase of promoter proximal Pol II at the majority of genes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Henriques et al., 2013</a>). The accumulation of paused Pol II has been proposed to be the result of rapid rounds of termination and re-initiation, creating a highly dynamic Pol II peak at the promoter proximal region (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brannan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Davidson et al., 2012</a>). However, paused Pol II in <i>Drosophila</i> seems remarkably stable as shown by extensive kinetic and in vivo analysis at the <i>Drosophila Hsp70</i> locus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Buckley et al., 2014</a>) and by estimation of decay rates of over a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> genes by blocking TFIIH helicase activity, and thereby initiation, with the drug triptolide (Trp) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Henriques et al., 2013</a>). Thus, <i>Drosophila</i> Pol II transcription can be regulated by the promoter proximal, stable pausing and by transcription factor-controlled entry of paused Pol II into productive elongation in <i>Drosophila</i>."

Expressed genes without a peak of paused Pol II in one cell type, may acquire pausing in another (<a href=\"#bib39\">Min et al., 2011</a>), indicating that genes have the potential of becoming regulated by promoter proximal pausing even when a promoter proximal Pol II peak is absent.

Genic features that could potentially influence elongation rates are often, but not exclusively, associated with exons. Examples are histone modifications around exons and within the gene body (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kolasinska-Zwierz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schor et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schwartz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Saint-Andr\u00e9 et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schor et al., 2013</a>), nucleosome occupancy (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schwartz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tilgner et al., 2009</a>), GC content of both intronic and exonic DNA (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schwartz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Amit et al., 2012</a>), and DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Maunakea et al., 2013</a>).

Indeed, transcription with a slow mutant of Pol II promotes alternative splicing in human and yeast cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Howe et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">de la Mata et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">de la Mata et al., 2010</a>)."

Despite observations of Pol II accumulation at exons, three studies that directly measured elongation rates at multiple genes could not clearly demonstrate a correlation between exons and elongation rate (<a href=\"#bib58\">Singh and Padgett, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Brody et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Danko et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, although in vitro studies clearly show the effect of nucleosomes and histone modifications on elongation rate (<a href=\"#bib45\">Orphanides et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hodges et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bintu et al., 2012</a>), the in vivo consequences of chromatin on elongation rate are less understood, primarily because of the inability to measure elongation rates at many genes simultaneously. Previous studies have measured elongation rates ranging from 1 to 4 kb/min at individual genes in various organisms (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ardehali and Lis, 2009</a>). Recently, elongation rates for over 160 genes were measured simultaneously by following the induction wave of Pol II after estradiol or TNF-alpha treatment (<a href=\"#bib16\">Danko et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, this study showed a broad range of elongation rates between and within cell types, suggesting that the control of elongation rate may be used to regulate transcription and co-transcriptional processes. Thus far, elongation rates have only been measured in rapidly inducible genes, which limits the analytical power to reveal the associations to various features of transcription. Therefore, it is critical to expand the number of elongation rates measured simultaneously in vivo, to allow systematic analysis of the correlation between exons, chromatin and elongation rate."

While FP blocks escape of paused Pol II, elongating Pol II can still clear the gene, and both changes can easily be followed by the sensitive and transcription orientation specific GRO-seq assay. We definitively show that P-TEFb is required for paused Pol II to escape into a productive elongation, providing a platform for transcription regulatory input on the early elongation rate, even for genes not previously known to be paused, confirming and extending earlier results using ChIP-seq of Pol II (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rahl et al., 2010</a>). Similarly, use of Trp to block Pol II initiation and entry to the pause, allows kinetic analysis of paused Pol II stability on nearly 3200 genes, showing that paused Pol II has a relatively long half-life and excluding rapid termination mechanisms as a major factor of Pol II regulation at the promoter. Furthermore, inhibition of Pol II gene body entry causes a \u2018wave\u2019 of elongating Pol II that, when assayed as a function of time after FP or Trp addition, allows measurement of elongation rates at over 1000 genes simultaneously, and over different regions within genes. We show that Pol II elongation rates increase within the gene body, suggesting a gradual maturation of the elongation complex as it progresses through the gene. In addition, we analyzed elongation rate variation as a function of a large number of genic and chromatin characteristics. Elongation rates correlate negatively with exon density and CpG content and methylation, and positively with active transcription mark H3K79me2. Overall, we can explain \u223c30% of the gene-by-gene variation in elongation rates. Our study of the dynamics of Pol II shows that elongation rate is highly dynamic at all genes, both at the promoter proximal region and within the gene body."

To identify all genes dependent on P-TEFb, we inhibited P-TEFb kinase activity with the drug FP. For comparison, we also inhibited pre-initiation complex formation with Trp. We isolated replicates of nuclei from untreated mESCs and cells treated for 2, 5, 12.5, 25 and 50 min with 300 nM FP, as well as nuclei treated for 12.5, 25, and 50 min with 500 nM Trp (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and performed GRO-seq with these nuclei (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). To minimize off-target and secondary effects, we first determined the minimum concentrations of FP and Trp required to clear Pol II from the <i>ActB</i> gene body using ChIP-qPCR with an antibody to total Pol II (not shown), and then used these concentrations, which were at the lower spectrum compared to previous studies (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chao and Price, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rahl et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Titov et al., 2011</a>), in our genome-wide analyses.

Both drugs work rapidly, as gene body density near the TSS approaches background levels within 12.5 min. The rapid drug action and immediate measurements thereafter minimize the possibility of major secondary effects within the short timeframe of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Furthermore, as the FP and Trp dependent block of Pol II entry into the gene persists, elongating Pol II forms \u2018inhibition waves\u2019 that are very similar between treatments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>, lower panels). Downstream of these inhibition waves, Pol II density levels remain equal throughout the time course, indicating that elongating Pol II in the gene body is not affected (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Conversely, the two drugs have opposite effects at the promoter proximal region. The composite paused Pol II peak increases after FP treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>), but disappears after Trp treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). These results confirm that Trp blocks transcription initiation and causes the time dependent clearing of Pol II from the promoter and gene body, while FP\u2019s prominent effect is to block escape from the pause, causing a time dependent gene body clearance but enhanced promoter proximal Pol II pausing."

To extend this result to mammals, we quantified changes in Pol II distribution near the TSS after FP treatment and compared it to the effects of Trp treatment. We selected the top 75% actively transcribed genes that are over 3.5 kb in length and well resolved (n = 6380, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and generated heat-maps of the Pol II density \u00b1 2 kb around the TSSs of each gene before and after 50 min of drug treatment on the sense or antisense strand (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The antisense strand shows the presence of upstream divergent transcription, a well-documented feature of mammalian promoters (<a href=\"#bib15\">Core et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Seila et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Flynn et al., 2011</a>). While Trp causes a reduction in the promoter and downstream regions of the annotated gene (sense strand), and the upstream divergent region (antisense strand) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), FP inhibition causes the opposite effect on the promoter regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Pol II density in the gene body is decreased after FP treatment, but Pol II increases in promoter proximal and divergent regions at the majority of genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). These results indicate that FP generally allows newly recruited Pol II to enter into early elongation and pausing, but blocks the entry into productive elongation. While a smaller fraction (\u223c20%) of genes displayed an unexpected decrease in paused and divergent Pol II peaks (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), these genes generally display lower levels of pausing and gene body transcription (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This suggests that FP can reduce initiation or increase termination of weakly paused and less active genes, either directly or indirectly. Generally, the change in Pol II promoter density after FP inhibition correlates positively with the preexisting level of pausing and productive transcription of a gene (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), suggesting that efficient initiation is a prerequisite for an FP-induced increase in paused Pol II."

Pausing indexes (PI) are the ratio between gene body and promoter proximal Pol II density, and the change in PI has therefore no Fisher Exact p-value associated with it. PI\u2019s are increased or decreased when the ratio between untreated and treated PI\u2019s is greater or smaller then 1, respectively."

We calculated decay rates of Pol II after Trp treatment using a first order exponential decay model, and found high confidence decay rates for 3181 genes (standard deviation &lt;0.5 times the decay rate) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>).

The average Pol II inhibition wave travels at identical rates after either Trp or FP treatment, indicating that inhibition of P-TEFb or off-target effects of FP are unlikely to have significant effects on elongation rates downstream of the promoter proximal region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Although the HMM did not always derive transition points for each timepoint of drug treatment within genes, the average transition points of genes with detectable inhibition waves at three time-points behaved identically to the average of the genes where the HMM derived only one or two transition points (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

The gradient of RNA density from the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 splice sites (SS) of the intron, normalized for gene expression by dividing intronic reads with the average read counts near the 3\u2032 end of the introns, reflects the time Pol II spends during elongation along the intron. Slow Pol II will take longer to transcribe an intron, accumulating more RNA-seq reads prior to splicing and degradation, and resulting in a steep intronic RNA-seq read gradient. Fast Pol II will spend less time in an intron, reaching the 3\u2032 SS and subsequent splicing and degradation of intronic RNA faster, resulting in a flatter intronic read pattern and a lower slope (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

The maturation could be caused by the stochastic accumulation of elongation factors to the Pol II complex, or by gradual stochastic loss of pausing factors. Indeed, pausing negatively correlates with mid elongation rates, while late elongation rates are not affected (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>), suggesting that pausing delays the maturation of Pol II. Furthermore, ChIP-seq composite profiles of total Pol II and of Ser5 or Ser2 phosphorylated CTD (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rahl et al., 2010</a>) show that Pol II Ser2 phosphorylation, which is a product of P-TEFb activity and other kinases (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bartkowiak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Devaiah et al., 2012</a>) and presumably coincides with the loss of NELF and DSIF pausing activity, increases gradually within the gene body within the same region as the acceleration of the elongation complex (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3E,F</a>).

However, the average GRO-seq density shows a decrease as the Pol II travels into the body of the gene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>, top panels). The decreasing pattern of gene body Pol II density in itself could be explained by the gradual termination of Pol II (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, top; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), but alternatively, an accelerating Pol II could on its own produce a decreasing gene body Pol II density (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, bottom; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Thirdly, a mixed model can be envisioned where a decrease in termination and acceleration go hand in hand as Pol II progresses in the gene body (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mason and Struhl, 2005</a>). The directly measured elongation rates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) can be used to assess the degree to which termination and acceleration models contribute to the observed Pol II density decrease. If there is no loss of Pol II through termination, then Pol II density should be inversely proportional to the elongation rate. Therefore, comparing the inverse of the measured elongation rates (<i>v</i><sup>\u22121</sup>) with the Pol II density (<i>D</i>) can be used to determine which model of Pol II elongation is more probable (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). On average, the inverse of the elongation rate (<i>v</i><sup>\u22121</sup>) does not fall below the density plot (<i>D</i>) in the gene body region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) where the rates are measured (starting from the average 5 min transition point 2.3 kb downstream of TSS).

Thus, deviation from a log\u2013log slope of 1 in a correlation plot between steady state mRNA levels as measured by RNA-seq and GRO-seq density (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) could potentially be explained by differences in elongation rates. Interestingly, genes that are relatively highly expressed show a slope of 1.8 indicating that mRNA level is not a simple function of GRO-seq density for these genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). We observed a modest correlation between elongation rate and GRO-seq (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), indicating that highly active genes have faster elongation rates and produce more mRNA, in agreement with a previous analysis of a smaller set of inducible genes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Danko et al., 2013</a>)."

In contrast, when plotting the production rates, that is the mid elongation rates multiplied by the corresponding GRO-seq densities, vs mRNA level, the slope is reduced to 1.6 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>), indicating that elongation rate can partially explain the divergence between Pol II density and the mRNA level at highly transcribed genes.

Therefore, we plotted the mean elongation rates of genes based on the number of exons within the average region that Pol II travels between 12.5 and 25 min FP (7.5\u201330 kb) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, left). Interestingly, the striking negative linear correlation between the number of exons and the elongation rates suggests that Pol II slows whenever it encounters an exon. To quantify the delay per exon, we plotted the exon density within the transition region of each gene against the elongation rate, and added a direct linear regression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, right, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Addition of an exon within the three regions, in which early, mid, and late elongation rates were derived, results in average delays of 37, 31 or 23 s respectively. Thus, the co-transcriptional delay of Pol II at exons is striking and might be linked to coupled splicing events. Interestingly, the delay is somewhat less in downstream regions of the gene body when Pol II is more fully phosphorylated (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>) and is generally elongating faster (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."

Interestingly, nucleosomes can be barriers to Pol II elongation and cause transient pauses to delay the Pol II traversal (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hodges et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bintu et al., 2012</a>). Therefore we explored the nucleosome occupancy as a function of elongation rates, and found that the nucleosome free region (NFR) is wider in genes with faster elongation rates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, right); the fastest gene group is shifted approximately 2 nucleosomes downstream compared to the slowest genes. This shows that a more nucleosome-free promoter architecture correlates positively with elongation rates, and implicates an intrinsic component of Pol II rate is determined in the earliest stages of transcription."

Interestingly, the top 20 6-mer sequences associated with slower elongation rates were enriched for repeats of CG dinucleotides (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, left). Moreover, we found a modest negative correlation between the CG density and the elongation rates in individual genes (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), opposite of the effect CG content has at the promoter. Interestingly, while elongation rates seems to be positively related to the NFR and GC content at promoters, elongation rate correlates negatively with CG content within the gene body (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, right panel) and is unaffected by nucleosome occupancy (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

Many of these are tightly linked to each other; the first intron length is related to H3K79me2 mark and directly linked to the exon density; CpG methylation and H3K36me3 is enriched specifically in exons. To ascertain the primary from secondary determinants of the elongation rates, we used a multivariate regression analysis. For individual genes, each feature was scaled to a rank-order based z-score to assume a Gaussian distribution, making different metric types comparable. We then iteratively assessed how combinations of the features fit to the linear model, and determined the association network with our elongation rate measurements."

All of these features are significantly associated with the elongation rates, the exon density having the strongest correlation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To find which of the features can have an independent effect on elongation rates, we examined how much of the correlation between each feature and the elongation rates could be explained by another feature (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). For example, the correlation between elongation rates and intron 1 length, gene body H3K36me3, and H3K4me1 can be explained almost entirely by the exon density alone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), since they do not show correlation with the residual of the elongation rates after fitting to the exon density model (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, gene body H3K79me2 and gene body CpG features cannot be explained mostly by exon density (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Likewise, H3K79me2 and CpG content have independent components from each other, while CpG methylation is tightly associated with CpG content (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These tight associations between exon density and intron 1 lengths, and between CpG count and methylation are also shown by principal component analysis (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), which also reveals the contribution of less major factors such as cohesin and the promoter architecture characterized by unmethylated CpG islands and the NFR. Therefore, the multivariate model progressively explains more of the variances and shows better fits when CpG content, exon density, and H3K79me2 are combined to explain elongation rate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Addition of more factors only slightly increases the variance explained by the model of elongation rates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, right panel), indicating that CpG content, exon density and H3K79me2 are the main modulators of elongation rate. While CpG content is likely to exert effects throughout the gene, H3K79me2 is mostly enriched within exon and intron 1, indicating that this histone modification is beneficial to elongation early in the gene, while the elongation complex is still accelerating. Together, multiple interactions of chromatin and gene features together impact elongation rate, and provide a first comprehensive examination of the regulation of elongation rate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

While transcription elongation rates often seem to be taken for granted, we show that elongation rates are surprisingly diverse, both at the promoter proximal region, within the gene body, and between genes. We definitively show that all genes have the potential of being regulated at the promoter proximal pause site, as all initiated Pol II undergoes a P-TEFb dependent step of escape into productive elongation. Furthermore, we find that the average half-life of paused Pol II is 7 min, indicating that Pol II pausing is remarkably stable, and not the consequence of fast, repeated rounds of initiation and termination. Finally, we measured elongation rates ranging from 0.5 to 4 kb/min at \u223c1000 genes and within different regions of genes. Strikingly, Pol II accelerates as it transcribes through the gene body, and a large amount of variation in elongation rates occurs between genes, and is associated with chromatin and exon density. Overall, we are able to predict \u223c30% of the intergenic variation in elongation rates with just three features, exon density, CpG content and methylation, and H3K79me2, providing a first quantitative assessment of how elongation rates are affected by gene structure."

However, not all active genes show signs of promoter proximal accumulation of paused Pol II in mES cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Min et al., 2011</a>, this study). Clearly, this accumulation of Pol II depends on both the rate with which pause complex is formed (the transcription initiation rate) and its rate of escape to elongation. Some transcription factors stimulate the formation of paused Pol II, others recruit P-TEFb directly or indirectly to facilitate the escape of paused Pol II, while others do both (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blau et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rahl et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Danko et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Li and Gilmour, 2013</a>). The balance of these factors at promoters, together with pausing factors that stabilize Pol II (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yamaguchi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kwak et al., 2013</a>) determine the relative accumulation paused Pol II. As we (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and others (<a href=\"#bib26\">Henriques et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Buckley et al., 2014</a>) have shown, pausing of Pol II is remarkably stable at many genes, indicating that termination does not have a great effect on promoter proximal Pol II levels. This stably-paused Pol II may help maintain accessibility of the promoter to regulatory factors that tune transcriptional output by simply changing the escape rate of paused Pol II into the body of the gene. Indeed, heat shock has recently been shown both optically and biochemically to increase the escape of paused Pol II into the gene body at the <i>Drosophila Hsp70</i> locus without decreasing termination of paused Pol II, arguing against a role for termination in the regulation of the accumulation and escape of paused Pol II."

Indeed, this is what we observe for the majority of genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). However, a small fraction of poorly expressed and weakly paused genes show a reduction in paused Pol II after FP treatment. We speculate that transcription initiation, Pol II pausing, and escape into productive elongation are not necessarily uncoupled processes for all genes. Instead, disruption of pausing dynamics by FP may feed back on transcription initiation and decrease the formation of paused Pol II. Other observations support a cross-talk of pausing and initiation. Depletion of Nelf can decrease expression of a subset of genes, indicative of a dependency of initiation on pausing, in this case through the maintenance of nucleosome free promoters by paused Pol II (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gilchrist et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, precise mapping of Pol II reveals that core promoter elements appear to contribute to stronger and more promoter proximal pausing in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kwak et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Venters and Pugh, 2013</a>). Overall, the specific inhibitors used in this manuscript inhibit either initiation or pause escape seemingly with few secondary effects, as the Pol II inhibition profile within gene bodies is remarkably similar after either drug treatment. Nonetheless, perturbations of one process could possibly have effects on the other, at least for some genes."

Exonic features such as CpG methylation, H3K36me3 and H3K4me1 could work synergistically to establish a transient slow down at exons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Although we demonstrate that Pol II slows down at exons, presumably to facilitate splicing, we could not determine whether a slowly transcribing Pol II increases inclusion of exons. Although rates of elongation have been shown to influence splicing outcomes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Howe et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">de la Mata et al., 2003</a>), the effects on specific genes, we suggest, will be governed by competing processes such as rates of splicing complex assembly, RNA secondary and tertiary structure formation, and regulatory factor binding. While our data cannot on its own assess the outcomes on alternative splicing of such competing and cooperating processes, our observed slow down of transcription at exons supports the general view that Pol II elongation rates are coupled to splicing at all exons."

The bins sizes are 500 bp, 1 kb, 2 kb, and 5 kb respectively for analyzing 5 min, 12.5 min, 25 min and 50 min time points. These sizes were selected so that each gene will have approximately 30\u201340 bins throughout the gene body regions, which was the optimal number for the HMM results. For each gene, the ratios in individual bins were internally normalized, by dividing by the average ratios of the last five bins at the 3\u2032 ends. These bins are considered as the Markov process as the observations (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). For efficient HMM calculation, the normalized ratios were digitized, ranging from 0 to 2.0, with a step size of 0.05. Therefore, each binned position can have 40 observed states of the read ratio, and the probability of each state follows a binominal distribution of <i>B</i>(<i>n</i>, <i>e</i>), where <i>n</i> = 20 and <i>e</i> is the emission probability. We assumed two hidden states, \u2018inhibition affected\u2019 and \u2018inhibition unaffected\u2019, with two emission probabilities <i>e</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>e</i><sub>2</sub>.

The Baum-Welch algorithm is used to estimate the transition and emission probabilities, by iterative calculations until the probabilities converge. If the iteration is over 200 cycles without convergence, we dropped the gene from further analysis. The transition point is calculated from these probabilities."

In essence, the paper is simple, using GRO-seq to map Pol II on a genome-wide scale under conditions where transcriptional initiation or Pol II pausing are blocked by drugs (triptolide and flavopiridol, respectively). Of course, the validity of the study hinges on the specificity of the drugs, but both appear quite specific. Many conclusions of this paper have essentially been made previously; e.g., pausing as a general feature of Pol II transcription in mammals and other (but not all) organisms; stability of paused Pol II; gene-specific elongation rates; increased elongation speed at more distal position; effect of exons. However, what is particularly important about this paper is that it addresses all these fundamentally important issues in the most comprehensive, genome-wide form, and it doesn't use unusual inducing conditions. In addition, the use of the intronic RNA-seq data as a way of obtaining drug-independent data to support the conclusions is clever. Some of these important issues have been controversial or unclear in the literature, and the results here are as definitive as one could expect. So, while one could question whether the paper is truly novel, it represents a significant advance on a very important subject. The paper is generally well written, although some of the specific results and figures take some time to understand what has been really done."

The main results provide strong support for numerous earlier studies arguing that elongation rates can vary significantly between genes, slow down through exonic regions, and correlates with CpG content and chromatin modifications like H3K79 methylation, while contradicting the idea that paused RNAPII complexes are rapidly terminated and replaced. The application of this technique to mouse stem cells is novel and well justified and will enrich existing datasets that for further studies seeking to correlate elongation rates with specific genic and epigenetic features."

However, as the Mason &amp; Struhl paper suggests, perturbation of either elongation rate or processivity by treating with 6-AU, or inactivation of an elongation factor could result in patterns of elongation rate and Pol II density as proposed by the mixed model."

Trp blocks XPB helicase function, which is a vastly different mechanism of transcription inhibition compared to FP inhibition, and not likely to have similar potential off-target effects of FP.

Extrinsic factors comprise the genic features within the gene body that don\u2019t directly interact with Pol II, but that do exert an effect on its elongation rate, such as histone modifications and exons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

We used these elongation rates for two reasons: 1. This is the biggest group of elongation rates, providing the greatest statistical power, and 2. We only used elongation rates measured between these two timepoints for all genes to minimize the variation of intrinsic acceleration of Pol II in these genes. The average transition points after 12.5 or 25 min drug treatment are 7 and 30 kb respectively, which often coincides with the H3K79me2 enrichment with the first exon and intron. After exon 2, we saw a significant drop in H3K79me2 levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), but this is often outside the region were elongation rates are measured. Therefore, H3K79me2 has a positive effect on elongation rate early in the gene independently of the intrinsic acceleration. Downstream of the 25 min transition point, the intrinsic acceleration of Pol II has completed, and additional positive effects on elongation rate by H3K79me2 may no longer be needed."

However, one study has previously shown that mouse endogenous retrovirus can trigger premature Pol II termination in the gene body (Jingfeng Li et al. 2012). Therefore, we made use of this information to answer two questions. First we asked whether the dynamics of promoter proximal Pol II is influenced on the potential Drosha target genes. Second is whether the Pol II termination is a general mechanism, taking place on sites with endogenous retrovirus sequences."

This is similar to the post poly-A accumulation of Pol II (black empty triangles). One possibility is that this Pol II accumulation originates from novel transcription initiation at the highly repeated region of the IAP LTR element. However, the fact that the accumulation of Pol II at this region is not resolved by FP treatment shows that the initiation site is distant, likely the promoter of the Polr1a gene, not a site inside the IAP LTR element. Although the precise mechanism cannot be determined for now, we believe this could be a case of microprocessor dependent Pol II termination specifically happening at this site."

In this paper, Tee et al. find, among other interesting results, that Erk2 kinase activity replaces TFIIH function at a number of developmental lineage genes, as tested by looking in mESCs at the effects of 30 min of 1 \u00b5M Trp treatment on developmental and mESC specific genes with ChIP-qPCR on the Ser5 phosphorylated CTD of Pol II. Interestingly, developmental genes were unaffected by Trp treatment, indicating a TFIIH independent initiation mechanism. We were unable to find the datasets generated for this paper (the reported SRA accession number SPR028688 did not retrieve any data in various databases), making it difficult to assess the Erk kinase, Ercc3 and Ser5 and total Pol II ChIP-seq data ourselves. Therefore, we used the Ser5, Ser2 and N-terminal Pol II ChIP-seq datasets generated by Rahl et al. (Cell, 2010), as well as our own GRO-seq datasets, before and after 25 min Trp treatment to best mimic the 30 min Trp treatment used by Tee et al., to look at the patterns of expression of the genes insensitive to Trp. Surprisingly, we could not reproduce the results reported by Tee et al. All actively transcribed genes reported as being insensitive to Trp treatment by Tee et al. were clearly inhibited by 25 min Trp treatment in our study, or not actively transcribed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 2</a> and data not shown)."

Thus, strain and growth condition differences could result in variation in gene expression. Indicative of this potential difference in gene expression, in our study and that of the Young lab, the Trp insensitive developmental genes were far less transcribed in V6.5 mESCs compared to the control genes Klf2 and Trim28 (transcribed \u223c10 x higher as measured by ChIP- and GRO-seq, note the y-axes for each browser shot). In contrast, the level of transcription for these genes as measured by Pol II-Ser5 ChIP-qPCR in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> of Tee et al. appears within the same order of magnitude for both control and Trp insensitive developmental genes, indicating that these genes are similarly active in the mESCs used in their experiment."
