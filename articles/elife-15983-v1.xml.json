Several molecules involved in cell interaction control collective migration, but what their precise role is and how is their expression finely tuned to orchestrate the different steps of the process is poorly understood. Here we show that the timely and threshold expression of the Netrin receptor Frazzled triggers the initiation of glia migration in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing. Frazzled expression is induced by the Glide/Gcm transcription factor in a dose dependent manner. Thus, the glial determinant also regulates the efficiency of collective migration. NetrinB but not NetrinA serves as a chemoattractant and Unc5 contributes as a repellant Netrin receptor for glia migration. Our model includes strict spatial localization of a ligand, a cell autonomously acting receptor and a fate determinant that act coordinately to direct glia towards their final destination."
