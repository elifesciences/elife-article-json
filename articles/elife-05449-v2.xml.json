                    "text": "Huntington's disease (HD) represents an important model for neurodegenerative disorders and proteinopathies. It is mainly caused by cytotoxicity of the mutant huntingtin protein (Htt) with an expanded polyQ stretch. While Htt is ubiquitously expressed, HD is characterized by selective neurodegeneration of the striatum. Here we report a striatal-enriched orphan G protein-coupled receptor(GPCR) Gpr52 as a stabilizer of Htt in vitro and in vivo. Gpr52 modulates Htt via cAMP-dependent but PKA independent mechanisms. <i>Gpr52</i> is located within an intron of <i>Rabgap1l</i>, which exhibits epistatic effects on Gpr52-mediated modulation of Htt levels by inhibiting its substrate <i>Rab39B</i>, which co-localizes with Htt and translocates Htt to the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, reducing Gpr52 suppresses HD phenotypes in both patient iPS-derived neurons and in vivo <i>Drosophila</i> HD models. Thus, our discovery reveals modulation of Htt levels by a striatal-enriched GPCR via its GPCR function, providing insights into the selective neurodegeneration and potential treatment strategies."

It is mainly caused by cytotoxicity of the mutant huntingtin protein (Htt) with an expanded polyQ stretch. While Htt is ubiquitously expressed, HD is characterized by selective neurodegeneration of the striatum. Here we report a striatal-enriched orphan G protein-coupled receptor(GPCR) Gpr52 as a stabilizer of Htt in vitro and in vivo. Gpr52 modulates Htt via cAMP-dependent but PKA independent mechanisms. <i>Gpr52</i> is located within an intron of <i>Rabgap1l</i>, which exhibits epistatic effects on Gpr52-mediated modulation of Htt levels by inhibiting its substrate <i>Rab39B</i>, which co-localizes with Htt and translocates Htt to the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, reducing Gpr52 suppresses HD phenotypes in both patient iPS-derived neurons and in vivo <i>Drosophila</i> HD models. Thus, our discovery reveals modulation of Htt levels by a striatal-enriched GPCR via its GPCR function, providing insights into the selective neurodegeneration and potential treatment strategies."

The protein, which is called Gpr52, is a receptor located within the outer membrane of neurons, particularly those in the striatum. Reducing the levels of this protein reduced the amount of mutant huntingtin protein that was able to accumulate inside cells grown in culture. Moreover, mice that were genetically engineered to possess a mutant <i>huntingtin</i> gene, but only a single copy of the gene for Gpr52, accumulated less mutant huntingtin in the striatum than mice with two copies of the Gpr52 gene."

Encouragingly, when genetic techniques were used to reduce Gpr52 synthesis in a fruit fly model of Huntington's disease, the treated flies showed fewer movement impairments than flies that had not been treated. In addition, reduced levels of Gpr52 were observed to lead to dramatic protective effects in neurons derived from the stem cells of a patient with Huntington's disease."

Such a treatment would be the first to target the causal mechanism behind Huntington's disease, rather than simply addressing the symptoms. The strategy could also be relevant to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders in which death of neurons is triggered by abnormal accumulation or aggregation of proteins."

Many similarities appear in these diseases, such as selective loss of neurons in certain brain regions and accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins (<a href=\"#bib36\">Soto, 2003</a>). In order to study these fundamental features and find treatment strategies of these diseases, Huntington's disease (HD) is often used as an important model because of its clear genetics (<a href=\"#bib39\">The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993</a>), which facilitates establishment of genetic models as well as early diagnosis. The major cause of HD is the cytotoxicity of the mutant Htt protein (mHtt) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rubinsztein and Carmichael, 2003</a>), which is expressed throughout the brain and peripheral tissues, but elicits selective neurodegeneration of the corpus striatum and lesser damage to the cerebral cortex in HD patients (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cowan and Raymond, 2006</a>). This selectivity is likely contributed, at least partially, by striatal-enriched modulators of mHtt toxicity and stability (<a href=\"#bib37\">Subramaniam et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tsvetkov et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with this idea, the neuronal longevity correlates with mHtt turnover, which is slower in striatal than in cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tsvetkov et al., 2013</a>), suggesting expression of striatal-enriched mHtt stabilizers. Discovery of such stabilizers may help understanding the selective pathology of HD."

Consistently, detected by both western-blots and Homogenous Time-Resolved F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (HTRF) assays (<a href=\"#bib43\">Weiss et al., 2009</a>), knocking-down Gpr52 significantly reduces Htt in these cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The effect is relatively specific, because levels of loading control proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 2</a>) and another polyQ protein ataxin3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) remain unchanged. The Htt lowering is not caused by antibody binding artifacts or Htt cleavage, as multiple antibodies detect comparable reduction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 2</a>) and there is no obvious increase of possible Htt fragments of lower molecular weights that may account for the lowering of the full length protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We further tested different biochemical fractions of the lysates including P1, P2 and S2, representing the crude nuclear fraction, the membrane/organelle fraction, and the cytosolic soluble fractions, respectively (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kegel et al., 2005</a>).

Consistent with this, the intracellular cAMP level is reduced by knocking-down Gpr52 (by 15.6 \u00b1 2.5 nM, 35.8 \u00b1 2.5 nM and 21.1 \u00b1 3.1 nM, respectively; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), suggesting some levels of constitutive activity. Uncovering the possible involvement of this cAMP reduction in lowering Htt is critical, because it determines whether we can target Gpr52's GPCR function to lower Htt. Thus, we tested the effect of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, which increases intracellular cAMP levels (by 54.8 \u00b1 5.7 nM; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Treatment of forskolin completely inhibits the Htt reduction caused by the Gpr52 knock-down (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <i>left</i> panel, lane 5 and 6 compared to lane 1 and 2; <i>Bar plot</i>), suggesting that the reduction of cAMP is required for the Gpr52 mediated Htt modulation. The canonical cAMP sensor is protein kinase A (PKA) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Meinkoth et al., 1993</a>). To test possible PKA-dependence, we treated the cells with Rp-cAMP, a non-hydrolysable cAMP analog that does not activate PKA (<a href=\"#bib30\">Rothermel and Parker Botelho, 1988</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Rp-cAMP completely inhibits the Gpr52's effect on Htt levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <i>middle</i> panel, lane 5 and 6 compared to lane 1 and 2; <i>bar plot</i>), indicating that the Htt reduction by knocking-down Gpr52 is mediated via a PKA-independent sensor of cAMP levels. Note that Rp-cAMP was applied at 1 \u00b5M, which is much lower than the <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> value for Rp-cAMP's inhibition of PKA (<a href=\"#bib30\">Rothermel and Parker Botelho, 1988</a>) and thus should not influence the PKA activity. Similarly, another cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2\u2032-O-Me-cAMP that does not activate PKA (<a href=\"#bib8\">Enserink et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) completely abolishes the Htt reduction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; <i>Bar plot</i>) as well. In contrast, the PKA inhibitor H89 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Takuma and Ichida, 1994</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and a PKA-specific agonist 6-Bnz-cAMP (<a href=\"#bib3\">Christensen et al., 2003</a>) fail to inhibit the Htt reduction by Gpr52 knock-down (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), confirming the PKA-independence. Finally, the hydrolysable cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP has little effect on the Gpr52 mediated Htt reduction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <i>middle</i> panel, lane 3 and 4 compared to lane 1 and 2; <i>bar plot</i>), whereas the non-hydrolysable cAMP analogs 8-pCPT-2\u2032-O-Me-cAMP and Rp-cAMP block the Gpr52's effect entirely (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), indicating that a sustained increase of the cAMP level is needed to abolish the Gpr52's effect."

Thus, Gpr52 may function via a PKA-independent and cAMP-dependent signaling mechanism by activating GEFs. The reported small GTPases downstream of these GEFs are Rap1 and Rap2, and thus we tested their potential involvement by dominant negative and constitutively active Rap proteins (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fu et al., 2007</a>). None of these showed obvious effects on the Htt lowering by Gpr52 knock-down (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting novel mechanisms potentially involving other GEFs and/or small GTPases, which is suggested in other models as well (<a href=\"#bib6\">Emery and Eiden, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kuwayama et al., 2013</a>). Given that the major function of small GTPases is trafficking, we tested potential Htt translocation events upon treatments of PKA-insensitive analogs Rp-cAMP or 8-pCPT-2\u2032-O-Me cAMP, and found that they lead to Htt enrichment at the perinuclear regions and co-localization with the endoplasmic reticulumn (ER) marker (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

The \u2018co-localization\u2019 of <i>Gpr52</i> and <i>Rabgap1l</i> in the genome might facilitate co-regulations of their expressions in certain cell types, so that they can balance each other's function in regulating Htt levels. Consistent with this hypothesis, knocking-down Rabgap1l increases Htt levels (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and blunts the Gpr52's effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, Htt lowering drops from 60.3 \u00b1 7.1% to 6.3 \u00b1 7.7%).

Gpr52 is enriched in the D2 neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Komatsu et al., 2014</a>), which are amongst the earliest affected in HD (<a href=\"#bib29\">Raymond et al., 2011</a>), possibly reflecting their susceptibility to mHtt due to expression of Gpr52. Further evidence needs to be obtained to reveal whether Gpr52 is one of the major causes of the regional specificity. For example, Gpr52 could be exogenously expressed in other brain regions in HD in vivo models to see if the regional specificity of neurodegeneration is shifted."

Our data confirm that the sustained lowering of cAMP is required for GPCR-mediated lowering of endogenous soluble full-length Htt through PKA-independent mechanisms. It is intriguing why other striatal GPCRs, such as dopamine receptors, were not identified as Htt modulators by our screenings. There are several major possibilities besides a random missing of these targets. First, in the knock-down screen that we performed, the GPCRs need to have a certain level of constitutive basal activity in order to be identified as hits. Second, a sustained change of cAMP is required to modulate Htt levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), and this may not be achieved by knocking-down many of the GPCRs in absence of agonists. Gpr52 may have a relatively high endogenous activity in the striatal cells, enabling it to provide a significant contribution to the endogenous cAMP levels. Alternatively, the endogenous Gpr52 ligand might be present at a certain level under endogenous conditions, and ligand is predicted to be fatty acids (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kakarala and Jamil, 2014</a>). Finally, cAMP may only be a required part of the mechanism, while other signaling pathway or the receptor itself may contribute as well."

This functional link is validated not only by the epistatic effects of Rabgap1l on Gpr52 mediated modulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), but also confirmed by the involvement of Rab39B (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), the substrate of Rabgap1l (<a href=\"#bib13\">Itoh et al., 2006</a>). To our knowledge, this is so far the only pair of intronic and host genes showing functional links. The shared genomic locus of <i>Gpr52</i> and <i>Rabgapl1</i> may facilitate their balance in modulating Htt levels via co-regulated expression in certain cell types. For example, they may share the same enhancer regions or transcription factors in striatal cells. Alternatively, <i>Gpr52</i> mRNA might be cleaved and processed from the intron of <i>Rabgap1l</i> pre-RNA, possibly in a similar way as the biogenesis of intronic lncRNAs that have been recently identified (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>).

A pair of TALEN constructs for Gpr52 knockout were cloned into a mammalian expression vector pCMV-TALEN and capped, polyA-tailed mRNA for injection were produced using the Ambion mMessage mMachine kit. The knockout mice were produced by microinjecting TALEN mRNAs into fertilized eggs from C57BL/6 strain. The knockout allele has been sequence validated to have eight missing base pairs (GAATGTGT, 57\u201364 of the ORF), causing a frameshift and an early stop (sequencing primers, forward: 5\u2032-agccaaagctgcaaactccct-3\u2032; reverse: 5\u2032-gaaccaagcaggtaactccaacg-3\u2032). The mRNA transcribed from targeted allele with frameshift undergoes nonsense-mediated decay. The mice were back-crossed to the wild-type background for five generations before crossing to the HD mice (with the same genetic background) or performing other experiments. The mouse experiments were carried out following the general guidelines published by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. The Animal Care and Use Committee of the School of Medicine at Fudan University approved the protocol used in animal experiments (Approval #20140904).

Purified cAMP provided by the kit was diluted into different concentrations to plot the standard curve. The slope of the standard curve was utilized to determine the cAMP concentration change per unit change of the signal. For PKA activity measurement, compounds diluted in Opti-MEM at indicated concentrations were directly added into 384 well plates, and then the experiments were performed following manufacture's instruction."

The supernatants were then loaded and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for western blots. For fractionation experiments that extract Htt proteins at different fractions, the cell lysates are fractionated into P1, P2 and S2 fractions according to the previously described protocol (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kegel et al., 2005</a>). Briefly, cell homogenates made in the homogenate buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA plus 1\u00d7 Complete Protease Inhibitor) were centrifuged at 2000\u00d7<i>g</i> to obtain the crude nuclear pellet (P1) and the postnuclear supernatant (S1). S1 was then centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7<i>g</i> to obtain the membrane pellet (P2) and the cytosolic fraction (S2). The P1 and P2 pellets were then washed with the homogenate buffer and resuspended in 1\u00d7 PBS buffer with 2% SDS by sonication on ice for 10 s. Equal amount (10\u201320 \u03bcg of total proteins) of each fraction was loaded in each lane for western-blots. For detection of the Gpr52 protein, the cells are lysed in 2% Fos-choline-14 in 1\u00d7 PBS to extract the membrane proteins. For mouse brain samples, all mice striatum and cortex tissues protein extracts were obtained in the following ice-cold extraction buffer: 50mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4, 250mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA.Na<sub>2</sub>, 1% Triton-100 with 1\u00d7 Complete Protease Inhibitor, and then homogenized by electric homogenizer.

Similar technical difficulties have been also reported by others (<a href=\"#bib17\">Komatsu et al., 2014</a>). All secondary antibodies were used at 1:5000.
