Human TLS involves the conjugation of ubiquitin to PCNA clamps encircling damaged DNA and the role of this post-translational modification is under scrutiny. A widely-accepted model purports that ubiquitinated PCNA recruits TLS polymerases such as pol \u03b7 to sites of DNA damage where they may also displace a blocked replicative polymerase. We provide extensive quantitative evidence that the binding of pol \u03b7 to PCNA and the ensuing TLS are both independent of PCNA ubiquitination. Rather, the unique properties of pols \u03b7 and \u03b4 are attuned to promote an efficient and passive exchange of polymerases during TLS on the lagging strand."
