In contrast to the extensive studies of feeding, its obligate counterpart, defecation, has received much less attention until recently. In this study, we report our characterizations of the defecation behavior of <i>Drosophila</i> larvae and its neural basis. <i>Drosophila</i> larvae display defecation cycles of stereotypic frequency, involving sequential contraction of hindgut and anal sphincter. The defecation behavior requires two groups of motor neurons that innervate hindgut and anal sphincter, respectively, and can excite gut muscles directly. These two groups of motor neurons fire sequentially with the same periodicity as the defecation behavior, as revealed by in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Moreover, we identified a single mechanosensitive sensory neuron that innervates the anal slit and senses the opening of the intestine terminus. This anus sensory neuron relies on the TRP channel NOMPC but not on INACTIVE, NANCHUNG, or PIEZO for mechanotransduction."

In contrast to the extensive studies of feeding, its obligate counterpart, defecation, has received much less attention until recently. In this study, we report our characterizations of the defecation behavior of <i>Drosophila</i> larvae and its neural basis. <i>Drosophila</i> larvae display defecation cycles of stereotypic frequency, involving sequential contraction of hindgut and anal sphincter. The defecation behavior requires two groups of motor neurons that innervate hindgut and anal sphincter, respectively, and can excite gut muscles directly. These two groups of motor neurons fire sequentially with the same periodicity as the defecation behavior, as revealed by in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Moreover, we identified a single mechanosensitive sensory neuron that innervates the anal slit and senses the opening of the intestine terminus. This anus sensory neuron relies on the TRP channel NOMPC but not on INACTIVE, NANCHUNG, or PIEZO for mechanotransduction."

At the posterior end of the hindgut is anal sphincter, which has a layer of thick sphincter muscles and a much narrower canal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Murakami and Shiotsuki, 2001</a>). Because the <i>Drosophila</i> larval body wall is transparent, contractions of the hindgut and anal sphincter can be monitored in vivo. Fluorescent markers, expressed with a hindgut-specific byn-Gal4 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Johansen et al., 2003</a>), allowed visualization of contractions of the larval hindgut and anus sphincter in whole-mount of living larvae (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The defecation behavior consists of sequential contractions of the posterior hindgut and anal sphincter in a very stereotypical manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>), leading to opening of the anal slit to expel feces out of the lumen. This defecation process is repeated every 38 s at 25\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). To demonstrate those gut movements triggered defecation, we fed the larvae with yeast laced with blue food dye and video taped their defecation cycle. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, each sequential contraction of hindgut and anus sphincter triggered a defecation cycle to expel feces out of the body."

Since the axons that innervate the hindgut are from the most posterior pair of the axon bundles in the ventral nerve cord (VNC), the cell bodies of the neurons that innervate the hindgut and anal sphincter are most likely in the terminal segments of the VNC. We identified two groups of neurons, labeled by PDF-Gal4 and HGN1-Gal4 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nassel et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Edgecomb et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Renn et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Landgraf et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cognigni et al., 2011</a>), which innervate the posterior hindgut and anal sphincter, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>). These neurons have their cell bodies in the terminal segments of VNC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) and send their axons along the midline of the ventral body wall to the posterior end of the larva, where they enter the hindgut. Within the hindgut, the HGN1 axons extend posteriorly to the anus sphincter surface to form dense arborizations over the muscles, while the PDF axons arborize over the posterior two-third of the hindgut with refined branches (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013H</a>). The PDF and HGN1 neurons are glutamatergic, as they could be labeled with antibody staining against <i>Drosophila</i> vGlut (<a href=\"#bib8\">Daniels et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K,L</a>). The axonal branches of PDF neurons on the hindgut can also be labeled with vGlut-Gal4 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mahr and Aberle, 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that they are likely glutamatergic motor neurons. The labeled neurons in both cases have their axon terminals in close proximity of the gut muscles and form abundant bouton structures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I,J</a>). These results suggest that PDF and HGN1 neurons, which are likely motor neurons, might play a role in regulating hindgut contractions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1M</a>)."

Illumination of the larval VNC with blue light caused a dramatic increase of EJPs in the anus sphincter muscles in the larva with ChR2 expression in the HGN1 neurons but not in the control animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>), providing evidence for HGN1 innervation of sphincter muscles. The PDF neurons have been previously shown to promote visceral muscle contractions (<a href=\"#bib43\">Talsma et al., 2012</a>). Activation of PDF neurons expressing ChR2 with blue light also triggered a dramatic increase of EJPs in the anus sphincter muscles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>), indicating that PDF neurons also play a role in regulating anal sphincter contractions, although PDF neurons do not directly form synapse with these muscles. This light-induced activation was absent in UAS or Gal4 control larvae and dependent on retinal, which is the chromosphere for ChR2 channels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>)."

Silencing the HGN1 neurons did not significantly alter the interval of anus sphincter opening (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Conceivably the peristaltic hindgut movements driven by PDF neuronal activity could have generated sufficient pressure to force open the anus sphincter. Indeed, silencing both the PDF neurons and HGN1 neurons caused the larva to display barely any hindgut movement over 5 min thus rendering it difficult to estimate the defecation interval, in contrast to the nearly eight cycles of contraction over 5 min\u2014corresponding to a defecation interval of 38 s\u2014in control animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

Green fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP) has been developed as a technique to indicate synaptic connection of two neurons, each expressing one component of the split GFP (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feinberg et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gordon and Scott, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gong et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Han et al., 2012</a>). We expressed the two GFP components separately in PDF neurons and HGN1 neurons by using two different binary expression systems, PDF-LexA and HGN1-Gal4. An intense GFP signal was observed in the area where the processes of these two groups of neurons overlap (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>), while neither PDF neuron nor HGN1 neuron expressing one part of the split GFP of GRASP generated any fluorescent signals by itself (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that a functional connection might exist between PDF and HGN1 neurons. By labeling the PDF neurons simultaneously with the dendritic RFP marker DenMark and the axonal GFP marker sytGFP, we found that the PDF neurons send their axons to the area where their processes overlap with HGN1 neuron dendrites (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

The dendritic arborization (da) neurons are primary sensory neurons, which cover the entire body wall of a <i>Drosophila</i> larva. They are important for sensing chemical, thermal, light, and mechanical stimulations (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tracey et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Xiang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yan et al., 2013</a>). In the vicinity of the anal slit, we found a specialized PPK-Gal4-labeled neuron. The cell body of this neuron resides on the anterior side of the anal slit, and its dendritic arbors surround the entire anal slit (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The majority of its dendrites forms a thin layer of arbors and covers the body wall around the anal slit (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). There are also some arborizations extending along the anus sphincter (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The axon of this sensory neuron joins the nerve bundle that includes the axons of other da neurons and projects to the terminal segment of the VNC."

We found that the defecation rhythm remains normal in the <i>iav</i>, <i>nan</i>, and <i>piezo</i> mutants. However, the defecation interval in the <i>nompC</i> mutants was significantly increased (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). NOMPC is a TRPN channel essential for adult hearing and larval gentle touch (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gong et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yan et al., 2013</a>). We found that NOMPC is highly expressed all over the dendrites and soma of the ASN, as revealed by staining with antibody against the NOMPC protein (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), raising the possibility that it might play a role in ASN sensing of radial stretch. Indeed, we found that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response is absent in the ASN of <i>nompC</i> null mutant larvae (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). This defect could be rescued by expressing wild-type NOMPC in the ASN with PPK-Gal4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>, <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). Our study thus identified a new role of the NOMPC channel, namely for sensing redial stretch of the intestinal terminus. NANCHUNG (NAN) and INACTIVE (IAV), two other TRP channels that often work in concert with NOMPC in other sensory neurons, are thought to form heterodimers and function in the mechanotransduction in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gong et al., 2004</a>). We also tested the role of IAV in the ASN's stretch sensing. We found the ASN of <i>iav</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> mutant larvae exhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> response comparable to that in the wild-type larvae (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>), suggesting that IAV is not required for the mechanotransduction of ASN."

In addition, we found a single sensory neuron that could sense the opening of the anal slit and send feedback to the motor neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Studies of <i>C. elegans</i> as a model system have investigated the defecation circuit (<a href=\"#bib44\">Thomas, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Avery and Thomas, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Branicky and Hekimi, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kwan et al., 2008</a>). Studies of the adult fly have identified neurons regulating defecation behaviors subject to dietary and reproductive modulation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cognigni et al., 2011</a>). In this study of the defecation behavior in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae, we have identified not only the motor neurons innervating gut muscles but also a sensory neuron strategically located to sense radial stretch during defecation and provide feedback to the central nervous system."

However, at the larval stage, the motor neurons and gut muscles as well as the sensory neuron responding to anus movement, all show very robust rhythmic activities. Given that feeding and defecation are dominant behaviors for third-instar larvae, conceivably robust rhythmic feeding and defecation behaviors may facilitate their nutrition intake and waste expulsion. In contrast, adult flies will likely encounter more complex environments and may need to conduct their defection behaviors in a more controllable manner."

Interestingly, the ASN could be labeled by both class III da neuronal marker and class IV da neuronal maker, raising the question whether it might have the dual functions to sense different stimuli.

The two motor neurons appear to be functionally connected, possibly involving synaptic connections between them, although we cannot exclude the possibility of multiple neurons being engaged in their functional connections. It remains to be determined as to how they are entrained with this rhythmic firing pattern, and whether it involves a central pattern generator upstream of PDF neurons. Interestingly, PDF is a peptide that has important roles in multiple neuropeptide signaling pathways in the fruit fly (<a href=\"#bib37\">Renn et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2013</a>); it would be interesting to test whether this neuropeptide also plays a role in the regulation of defecation behaviors by PDF neurons in the VNC. It is also of interest to explore possible contributions of indirect effects of PDF over muscle contraction, such as an influence of tracheal branching in the hindgut that may affect muscle contractions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Linneweber et al., 2014</a>). Recently, a study has suggested a novel role of HGN1 neurons in regulating the long-term food intake behaviors of adult flies (<a href=\"#bib34\">Olds and Xu, 2014</a>). In our study we found that HGN1 neurons control the rhythmic pattern of larval defecation. These two studies suggest that <i>Drosophila</i> HGN1 neurons at different developmental stages might have multiple functions in regulating feeding and defecation behaviors."

It remains an open question as to the extent of similarity of the mechanisms that control the gut movements. Diseases such as Hirschsprung's disease and anorectal malformation with failure to pass meconium (<a href=\"#bib28\">Loening-Baucke and Kimura, 1999</a>) are caused by developmental abnormality related to the gut and its innervation. Several genes and specific regions on the chromosomes have been shown or suggested to be associated with Hirschsprung's disease. Mutations in two human genes could lead to the absence of certain nerve cells in the colon (<a href=\"#bib36\">Puri and Shinkai, 2004</a>). With the powerful genetic tools, further study of the <i>Drosophila</i> larval gut rhythmicity and its neural modulation will help us identify evolutionarily conserved features as well as strategies that may have been adopted by different organisms for their fitness."

Cells were used for recording if the R<sub>m</sub> value was greater than 500 M\u03a9 and the membrane potential value was lower than \u221250 mV. A small constant hyperpolarizing current was injected during recording, immediately after break-in, to bring the membrane potential of neurons to approximately \u221260 mV. Cells were held at \u221260 mV in voltage-clamp mode for EPSC recordings. Signals were acquired with an Axon-700B multiclamp amplifier and were digitized at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz using a 1322A D-A converter. Data were analyzed using Clampex 9.0 software (Molecular Devices)."

The paper has three main topics in the results; characterisation of the defecation motor programme, characterisation of three neuronal populations which control hind-gut muscle contractions and identification and characterisation of a neuronal TRP channel involved in mechanosensory feedback. Some of the data is of high quality (e.g. calcium imaging experiments) and the potential finding of a mechanosensitive neuron involved in the process is novel and potentially interesting. The work could have wider implications for understanding defecation and the generation of rhythmic behaviour, but there are substantial concerns with the paper as it stands."

In particular, Cognigni et al developed a method that allows quantification of diuresis, enteric function, and food intake, and showed complex dietary and reproductive modulation of some of these features. The characterisation of the neuronal circuitry underlying defecation per se is useful but linking to the above features is of broader interest and should be attempted. Furthermore, contrary to what the authors state, only one of the three neuronal populations that they \u201cidentify\u201d is novel in this context, given that: 1) The PDF neurons have been previously shown not only to innervate the hindgut (Nassel et al J Comp Neurol 1993, <a href=\"#bib43\">Talsma et al 2012</a> PNAS), and also to promote visceral muscle contractions (Talsma et al PNAS 2012), and 2) The RN2 neurons have also been shown to innervate the hindgut and to regulate faecal output (Cognigni et al Cell Metab 2011, line referred to as HGN1-Gal4).

The experiments suggested below are achievable in a reasonable timeframe of about three months if the authors have the tools to manipulate those neurons with cellular resolution (all three drivers are much more broadly expressed so the observed behavioural effects, if any, could be secondary to interfering with all those other neurons). Substantial points are elaborated and listed below."

The authors infer, but never show, effects of these neurons on defecation based on their effects on hindgut muscle contractions. Defecation rate could be subject to additional layers of neuronal control involving both visceral and somatic muscles, so the authors would need to show that these neurons do regulate defecation by, for example, using Fluoropoo (Cognigni et al Cell Metab 2011) if it works in larvae or by loading larval guts with dye-supplemented yeast and then recording defecation rate on unlabelled yeast. Related to this, the authors often make statements about defecation \u201crhythms/cycles\u201d akin to those reported in C. elegans. These are based, as far as one can tell, on the rhythmic Ca2+ oscillations observed in resting PDF and RN2 neurons. However, the muscle recordings are not particularly rhythmic in resting conditions, and no evidence for rhythmic defecation events has been provided. For example, the pattern of EJPs shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> is described as rhythmic, however whilst it looks sporadic it does not look overtly rhythmic, analysis should be performed to support this statement and in support of a correlation between hind-gut contraction and defecation itself. Previously published data (Edgecomb J Exp Biol 1994 and Cognigni et al Cell Metab 2011) argues against a robust rhythm at least in adults, where defecation rate is regulated by both environmental (e.g. dietary content) and internal (e.g. reproductive) state. Thus, the conditions in which rhythmic defecation is observed should be precisely described."

If the two measurements are the same thing, which one would hope, then the data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a> should be presented using the same measure, i.e. either both should be period in seconds or both should be defecation per period.

Importantly, PDF has been shown to regulate tracheal branching in the hindgut, which could also affect muscle contractions (Linneweber et al Cell 2014). In the GoF muscle physiology experiments, no \u201craw\u201d data has been provided for PDF neurons, and different experiments seem to have been conducted for the two neuronal populations. Only one control seems to have been used for the ChR2 experiments \u2013 several are normally required (+/- all-trans retinal, Gal4 and UAS parental controls).

Similarly activation of PDF by ChR2 would be expected to give rise to anal sphincter EJPs. Another expectation is that inactivation of PDF may result in no Ca2+ signals in RN2, this could be tested by combining available reagents.

These correlate to the opening of the anus and activity in PDF and RN2, however no functional test of the hypothesis that ASN activation lies downstream of PDF, RN2 and anal opening is shown. One experiment would be to show that inactivation of PDF results in a loss of Ca2+ signals in ASN. A more positive experiment would be to show that activation of RN2 (using ChR2 or dTRPA1) in turn activates ASN. The feedback experiments use a very indirect test of feedback onto PDF and/or RN2, EJPs in the anal sphincter muscles. This may be acting through ASN-PDF-RN2-anal sphincter muscle series. However there are other explanations, in particular it does not rule out other routes of ASN feedback onto the anal sphincter muscles. It would be much better to test the effect of ASN activity more directly on PDF. For example do NOMPC mutants have changes in PDF Ca2+ signals, which are alleviated by NOMPC rescue in ASN? Does ablation of ASN change PDF calcium signals? Even better would be activation of ASN and direct measurement of signals in PDF. This would add significant weight to the argument that ASN is a functional modify of PDF properties."

These correlate to the opening of the anus and activity in PDF and RN2, however no functional test of the hypothesis that ASN activation lies downstream of PDF, RN2 and anal opening is shown. One experiment would be to show that inactivation of PDF results in a loss of Ca2+ signals in ASN. A more positive experiment would be to show that activation of RN2 (using ChR2 or dTRPA1) in turn activates ASN. The feedback experiments use a very indirect test of feedback onto PDF and/or RN2, EJPs in the anal sphincter muscles. This may be acting through ASN-PDF-RN2-anal sphincter muscle series. However there are other explanations, in particular it does not rule out other routes of ASN feedback onto the anal sphincter muscles. It would be much better to test the effect of ASN activity more directly on PDF. For example do NOMPC mutants have changes in PDF Ca2+ signals, which are alleviated by NOMPC rescue in ASN? Does ablation of ASN change PDF calcium signals? Even better would be activation of ASN and direct measurement of signals in PDF. This would add significant weight to the argument that ASN is a functional modify of PDF properties</i>."
