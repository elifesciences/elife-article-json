Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of this process and currently, both VEGF and its receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and Neuropilin1 (NRP1), are targeted in therapeutic strategies for vascular disease and cancer. NRP1 is essential for vascular morphogenesis, but how NRP1 functions to guide vascular development has not been completely elucidated. Here, we generated a mouse line harboring a point mutation in the endogenous Nrp1 locus that selectively abolishes VEGF-NRP1 binding <i>(Nrp1<sup>VEGF-</sup>). Nrp1<sup>VEGF-</sup></i> mutants survive to adulthood with normal vasculature revealing that NRP1 functions independent of VEGF-NRP1 binding during developmental angiogenesis. Moreover, we found that <i>Nrp1</i>-deficient vessels have reduced VEGFR2 surface expression in vivo demonstrating that NRP1 regulates its co-receptor, VEGFR2. Given the resources invested in NRP1 targeted anti-angiogenesis therapies, our results will be integral for developing strategies to re-build vasculature in disease."
