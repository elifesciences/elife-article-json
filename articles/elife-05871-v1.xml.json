Several components of the cardiac injury microenvironment have been identified, yet no factor on its own is known to stimulate overt myocardial hyperplasia in a mature, uninjured animal. In this study, we find evidence that Neuregulin1 (Nrg1), previously shown to have mitogenic effects on mammalian cardiomyocytes, is sharply induced in perivascular cells after injury to the adult zebrafish heart. Inhibition of Erbb2, an Nrg1 co-receptor, disrupts cardiomyocyte proliferation in response to injury, whereas myocardial Nrg1 overexpression enhances this proliferation. In uninjured zebrafish, the reactivation of Nrg1 expression induces cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation, overt muscle hyperplasia, epicardial activation, increased vascularization, and causes cardiomegaly through persistent addition of wall myocardium. Our findings identify Nrg1 as a potent, induced mitogen for the endogenous adult heart regeneration program."

Several components of the cardiac injury microenvironment have been identified, yet no factor on its own is known to stimulate overt myocardial hyperplasia in a mature, uninjured animal. In this study, we find evidence that Neuregulin1 (Nrg1), previously shown to have mitogenic effects on mammalian cardiomyocytes, is sharply induced in perivascular cells after injury to the adult zebrafish heart. Inhibition of Erbb2, an Nrg1 co-receptor, disrupts cardiomyocyte proliferation in response to injury, whereas myocardial Nrg1 overexpression enhances this proliferation. In uninjured zebrafish, the reactivation of Nrg1 expression induces cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation, overt muscle hyperplasia, epicardial activation, increased vascularization, and causes cardiomegaly through persistent addition of wall myocardium. Our findings identify Nrg1 as a potent, induced mitogen for the endogenous adult heart regeneration program."

Gemberling et al. investigated the role of this protein in the regeneration of the heart in adult zebrafish. The experiments show that when the heart is injured, the gene encoding the Nrg1 protein is switched on in cells of the outer layer of the heart wall. When Nrg1 is deliberately activated in uninjured adult zebrafish hearts, it causes the muscle cells to divide, leading to many new layers of heart muscle forming over the course of several weeks. Along with promoting cell division, Nrg1 also makes the heart muscle cells return to an immature state more like stem cells."

In developing zebrafish or mouse embryos, Nrg1 signaling is critical for cardiac myofiber trabeculation. Mice mutant in Nrg1, or in its receptors ErbB2 or ErbB4, die at mid-gestation, or later with cardiac-restricted mutations, from thin ventricular walls and aberrant trabeculation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gassmann et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Meyer and Birchmeier, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, different forms of Nrg1 peptides have been delivered to adult animals, with various effects on the cardiovascular system. Nrg1 delivery to embryonic mouse cardiac explants or embryonic rat cardiomyocytes increased their proliferation in culture (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zhao et al., 1998</a>), and Nrg1 treatment of cultured adult mouse cardiomyocytes or systemic injection into adult mice induced cardiomyocyte proliferation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bersell et al., 2009</a>). Although the proliferative increases in this latter study were relatively small, the authors also found evidence that Nrg1 injection improves cardiac repair after MI. Nrg1 has reported effects on cell survival, metabolism, angiogenesis, and myofiber structure in addition to cardiomyocyte proliferation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Parodi and Kuhn, 2014</a>), influences that are possibly reflected by functional improvement after Nrg1 infusion in congestive heart failure patients (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jabbour et al., 2011</a>)."

Indeed, a recent study argued that Nrg1 delivery to adult mice has no effects on cardiomyocyte proliferation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reuter et al., 2014</a>). To address this, we examined the role Nrg1 might play in the strong, endogenous regenerative response of the adult zebrafish heart. We find that zebrafish <i>nrg1</i> is upregulated in perivascular cells following cardiac injury, and that blockade of Nrg1 signaling inhibits injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Most strikingly, transgenic reactivation of Nrg1 expression in the absence of cardiac injury stimulated many hallmarks of cardiac regeneration and markedly enhanced ventricular size. These findings implicate Nrg1 as a key mitogenic node between injury and the endogenous heart regeneration program."

The ventricular wall thickened by \u223c76% at 7 dpt compared to controls, by \u223c265% at 14 dpt, and by \u223c459% after 30 days of overexpression (n = 8\u201311; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013E</a>). To test the extent to which cellular hypertrophy contributes to this wall thickening, we assessed the size and numbers of cardiomyocytes, which are predominantly mononuclear in adult zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wills et al., 2008</a>). We found large increases in the number of cardiomyocyte nuclei within the ventricular wall after 14 days of <i>nrg1</i> expression, and no evidence for increased cardiomyocyte size (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). Thus, most or all of the effects of <i>nrg1</i> reactivation are hyperplastic. Such an extreme hyperplastic response to a single factor, which we term Nrg1-induced cardiac hyperplasia (iCH) for brevity, was unexpected from the published body of literature."

First, to reveal the spatiotemporal growth patterns of cardiogenesis, we coupled iCH with multicolor clonal analysis. The cortical muscle in the ventricular wall typically forms from a small number of large cardiomyocyte clones. These clones expand laterally on the ventricular surface and largely retain discernable boundaries through adulthood (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gupta and Poss, 2012</a>). By contrast, regeneration of resected muscle occurs through roughly uniform proliferation by many cardiomyocytes near the injury site, generating a mixed conglomeration of small clones in the restored ventricular wall (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gupta et al., 2013</a>). We induced <i>nrg1</i> expression simultaneously with permanent multicolor labeling in 5 weeks post-fertilization (wpf) juvenile animals, around the time of the initial emergence of cortical muscle. iCH caused ectopic wall thickening by 10 wpf, with obvious clone mixing and clone growth in the Z-plane away from the lumen (14/14 iCH, 0/11 controls; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013F</a>).

After partial ventricular resection, cardiomyocytes near the injury activate regulatory sequences of the embryonic cardiogenic transcription factor <i>gata4</i>, before dividing to create new muscle (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kikuchi et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, Gata4 activity is essential for regeneration of this muscle (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gupta et al., 2013</a>). Using a transgenic reporter strain, we found that 7 days of iCH in mature adults induced <i>gata4:EGFP</i> expression in the outermost layer of cortical muscle (9/10 iCH, 1/11 controls; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G,H</a>). Additionally, by coupling iCH with a transgenic reporter visualizing cardiomyocyte Actinin3 localization, we found that cortical muscle displayed reduced <i>cmlc2</i> expression and poorly organized sarcomeres (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8M\u2013P</a>). These observations together suggest a reduction in the contractile program that is indicative of dedifferentiation. iCH also activated myocardial expression of <i>tgf\u03b23</i>, which was implicated previously in regeneration (4/5 iCH, 0/5 controls; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I,J</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chablais and Jazwinska, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Choi et al., 2013</a>). We examined other cardiac cells types for their response to iCH. Retinoic acid synthesis in endocardial and epicardial cells is induced by myocardial injury, where RA signaling is essential, but not sufficient, for cardiomyocyte proliferation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kikuchi et al., 2011b</a>). Fibronectin (Fn) synthesis is also activated in the epicardium by injury and is an essential extracellular matrix (ECM) component of regeneration (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Both <i>raldh2</i> and <i>fn1</i> were induced in the epicardium by 7 days of iCH (7 of 9 iCH, 0 of 10 controls for each marker) consistent with the presence of a regenerative program (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K,L,Q,R</a>). Along with epicardial marker induction, 7\u201314 days of iCH induced expansion of the epicardial layer that is reminiscent of that observed during regeneration (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lepilina et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wang et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8S,T</a>). Finally, we assessed myocardial vascularization, which occurs concomitantly with injury-induced regeneration (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lepilina et al., 2006</a>). The adult zebrafish ventricle typically has a thin muscular wall penetrated with vessels, but 30 days of iCH stimulated formation of major vascular network throughout the expanded ventricular wall (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8U,V</a>). After 6 months of iCH, many large coronary vessels were evident in the ventricle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Together, this analysis indicates that expression of a single molecule, Nrg1, is sufficient to induce and maintain critical aspects of the heart regeneration program that encompass several cell types."

Thus, the primary cellular target of Nrg1 is likely to be cardiomyocytes. Nrg1 effects additionally involve organizing a tissue microenvironment that includes expression of additional mitogenic factors, ECM regulation, and vascular perfusion. This recruitment of various non-myocyte cell types is likely to be an endogenous role of Nrg1, given that it is also known to stimulate vascularization after ischemic injury in the hindlimb and is capable of inducing expression of ECM components in fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hedhli et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kim et al., 2012</a>).

These distinct experimental delivery methods could result in markedly different Nrg1 doses, target cells, and target receptor responses. It will be critical to define the mechanisms by which Nrg1 is induced by injury in zebrafish and restricted in the absence of trauma, as well as downstream Nrg1 targets in the regeneration program. Such investigation of the endogenous regulation of Nrg1 after cardiac injury can help guide methodology to optimize its delivery and impact on heart regeneration in mammals."

Doppler parameters were measured using the Vevo2100 Cardiac Package by taking the average measurement of three consecutive contractions. Velocity time integral (VTI) and VTI*HR were used as measures of cardiac performance and output. Cardiac output could not be formally calculated, as outflow tract (OFT) diameter could not be directly measured by echocardiography. However, OFT diameter was not significantly different between experimental groups when measured in tissue sections (data not shown).

They show that neuregulin is upregulated after injury and that and pharmacological blockage reduces cardiomyocyte proliferation after heart resection whereas transgenically induced overexpression results in a higher proliferative index. Interestingly, overexpression of Nrg1 under normal conditions demonstrates its \u201csufficiency\u201d to initiate expansion of the cardiomyocyte population in the absence of injury. This results in induction of cell behaviors and gene expression reminiscent of regenerative cardiomyocytes and a continuous expansion of the cortical heart muscle layer."

First, Nrg1 is required for embryonic development, which makes global Nrg1 null mutants unavailable for adult regeneration experiments. Thus a genetic loss-of-function experiment requires the creation of a conditional allele. As of now there are no reports in zebrafish of the successful generation of a conditional loss-of-function allele. It is important to introduce inducible gene deletion technology to highly regenerative systems like zebrafish, axolotl, and planarians, and we are actively working with others in the field on this. However, as this would take at least one year to complete and test, we are unable to provide the analysis here."

Experiments to address cell-type specificity are actively being pursued in the laboratory and are an important next step, but are at least a year from completion due to the generation of numerous new transgenic lines to address these questions. Published reports show that Nrg1 can induce proliferation in cultured cardiomyocytes, suggesting that the effect is direct on cardiomyocytes. Current technology would allow us to express an activated form of the Erbb4 receptor specifically in cardiomyocytes, yet any downstream effect could be due to activation of Nrg1- or non-Nrg1-mediated pathways. Questions of cell type- specific activation or necessity in Nrg1-mediated enhancement of cardiomyocyte proliferation are important; yet as indicated above, attempts to acquire these secondary supportive data by the creation of novel tools would substantially delay our reporting the striking effects of Nrg1. This is current controversy over whether Nrg1 has mitogenic effects in the adult heart, amplified even more by a recent paper challenging this view published in December during the review of our manuscript (<a href=\"#bib35\">Reuter et al., 2014</a>, PLoS One, 9(12): e115871). Therefore, we feel it is critical to report our primary findings as soon as possible without these new tools and supportive data."
