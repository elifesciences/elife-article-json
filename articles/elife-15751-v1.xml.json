Here we describe an assay to measure neuronal GIRK2 activity as a function of membrane-anchored G protein concentration. Using this assay we show that four G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits bind cooperatively to open GIRK2, and that intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> - which enters neurons during action potentials - further amplifies opening mostly by increasing G\u03b2\u03b3 affinity. A Na<sup>+</sup> amplification function is characterized and used to estimate the concentration of G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits that appear in the membrane of mouse dopamine neurons when GABAB receptors are stimulated. We conclude that GIRK2, through its dual responsiveness to G\u03b2\u03b3 and Na<sup>+</sup>, mediates a form of neuronal inhibition that is amplifiable in the setting of excess electrical activity."
