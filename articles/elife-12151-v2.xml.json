                    "text": "Communication between pre- and postsynaptic cells promotes the initial organization of synaptic specializations, but subsequent synaptic stabilization requires transcriptional regulation. Here we show that fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF22), a target-derived presynaptic organizer in the mouse hippocampus, induces the expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) for the stabilization of presynaptic terminals. FGF22 is released from CA3 pyramidal neurons and organizes the differentiation of excitatory nerve terminals formed onto them. Local application of FGF22 on the axons of dentate granule cells (DGCs), which are presynaptic to CA3 pyramidal neurons, induces IGF2 in the DGCs. IGF2, in turn, localizes to DGC presynaptic terminals and stabilizes them in an activity-dependent manner. IGF2 application rescues presynaptic defects of <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></i> cultures. IGF2 is dispensable for the initial presynaptic differentiation, but is required for the following presynaptic stabilization both in vitro and in vivo. These results reveal a novel feedback signal that is critical for the activity-dependent stabilization of presynaptic terminals in the mammalian hippocampus."

Here we show that fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF22), a target-derived presynaptic organizer in the mouse hippocampus, induces the expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) for the stabilization of presynaptic terminals. FGF22 is released from CA3 pyramidal neurons and organizes the differentiation of excitatory nerve terminals formed onto them. Local application of FGF22 on the axons of dentate granule cells (DGCs), which are presynaptic to CA3 pyramidal neurons, induces IGF2 in the DGCs. IGF2, in turn, localizes to DGC presynaptic terminals and stabilizes them in an activity-dependent manner. IGF2 application rescues presynaptic defects of <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></i> cultures. IGF2 is dispensable for the initial presynaptic differentiation, but is required for the following presynaptic stabilization both in vitro and in vivo. These results reveal a novel feedback signal that is critical for the activity-dependent stabilization of presynaptic terminals in the mammalian hippocampus."

One gene in particular, which encodes a protein called insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), was much less expressed in mice that lack FGF22 compared to normal mice. Further experiments revealed that only active nerve cells transport IGF2 to synapses, and that IGF2 helps to stabilize these structures. By contrast, IGF2 is not required for synapse to initially form. This indicates that FGF22 controls both the formation and stabilization of synapses, and that it controls the first stage directly, and the second stage indirectly via its effects on IGF2 expression."

Proper synapse formation is critical for appropriate brain function; aberrant synaptic connectivity may result in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as autism, Fragile X syndrome, epilepsy, and schizophrenia (<a href=\"#bib9\">Banerjee et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Casillas-Espinosa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lisman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pfeiffer and Huber, 2009</a>). Synapse formation begins with target recognition by axons, which is followed by synaptic differentiation at the contact sites. Synaptic differentiation is regulated by signals that are exchanged between pre- and postsynaptic sites. Various target-derived presynaptic organizers, such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), WNTs, neurotrophins, neuroligins, Ephs/ephrins, SynCAMs, netrin-G ligands (NGLs), and signal regulatory proteins (SIRPs) are shown to promote local differentiation of presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#bib22\">Darabid et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fox and Umemori, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Henriquez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Johnson-Venkatesh and Umemori, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Regehr et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Salinas, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Shen and Scheiffele, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Siddiqui and Craig, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Toth et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Zweifel et al., 2005</a>)."

Presynaptic stabilization has been shown to require gene expression. At the <i>Drosophila</i> larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a retrograde signal initiated by glass bottom boat (Gbb), the <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of bone morphogenic protein (BMP), controls presynaptic growth and stabilization through transcriptional regulation in motor neurons. During this process, Gbb and its receptor are internalized and transported from the nerve terminal to the cell body as a retrograde signal. This signal then activates a transcription factor, Mothers against decapentaplegic (Mad) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aberle et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Marqu\u00e9s et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McCabe et al., 2003</a>). Activated Mad regulates transcription of genes including <i>Trio</i> and <i>dfmr1</i> (fly homolog of FMR1). Trio and dFMR1 play critical roles in modulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics and stabilizing microtubules in the presynaptic motor neurons, leading to presynaptic growth and stabilization (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ball et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nahm et al., 2013</a>). In the mammalian brain, changes in gene expression, as a consequence of axon\u2013dendrite contacts, are also likely to contribute to presynaptic stabilization. For example, expression of genes encoding vesicle proteins increases soon after synaptogenesis begins, and neurons synthesize different isoforms of vesicle proteins before and after their axons contact targets (<a href=\"#bib12\">Campagna et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lou and Bixby, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Plunkett et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</a>).

FGF22-dependent presynaptic differentiation requires two FGF receptors (FGFRs), FGFR2b and FGFR1b, in dentate granule cells (DGCs), the major presynaptic neurons for CA3 pyramidal neurons, and the downstream signaling molecules FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2) and PI-3 kinase (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dabrowski et al., 2015</a>). Signals mediated by FRS2 and PI-3 kinase are known to regulate gene expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that FGF22 signaling eventually regulates gene expression and that those FGF22-induced molecules, in turn, contribute to the stabilization of presynaptic terminals."

We find that i) target-derived FGF22 signaling induces the expression of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (<i>Igf2</i>) gene in DGCs, ii) IGF2 then localizes to presynaptic terminals of DGCs and stabilizes them, iii) the transportation of IGF2 to the presynaptic terminal is activity-dependent, and iv) IGF2 is not required for the initial presynaptic differentiation, but is required for subsequent presynaptic stabilization both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, FGF22 is a target-derived molecule not only organizing local, initial presynaptic differentiation, but also regulating IGF2 expression in the presynaptic neurons. IGF2, in turn, contributes to presynaptic stabilization in an activity-dependent manner. Our results reveal a novel feedback signal that is critical for the activity-dependent stabilization of presynaptic terminals in the mammalian brain."

We hypothesized that in the hippocampus, the excitatory presynaptic organizer FGF22 would activate gene expression in the presynaptic neurons for the stabilization of presynaptic terminals. We focused on genes expressed in DGCs, because they provide a major excitatory input to CA3 pyramidal neurons, and their presynaptic differentiation is dependent on FGF22\u2013FGFR signaling (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dabrowski et al., 2015</a>). In the hippocampus, synapse formation starts in the first postnatal week and finishes by postnatal day 28 (P28) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Danglot et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Steward and Falk, 1991</a>). Presynaptic defects in <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>mice begin to appear as early as P8 and are evident at P14 (<a href=\"#bib71\">Terauchi et al., 2010</a>). To identify FGF22-regulated genes, we dissected P14 DGCs and compared gene expression profiles between wild-type (WT) and <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>mice. Microarray analysis revealed several genes that are downregulated in <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>DGCs relative to controls (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). One of the most significantly downregulated genes was <i>Igf2</i>. This down-regulation was confirmed by RT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), qPCR (<i>Igf2</i> was decreased to 53.1 \u00b1 12.2% in <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>mice relative to WT mice), and in situ hybridization. In situ hybridization experiments showed that at P14, and not at P7, expression of <i>Igf2</i> mRNA was decreased in DGCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013D</a>). It was not decreased in other hippocampal cells such as CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013D</a>). Interestingly, <i>Igf2</i> expression was clearly decreased in the inner layer of <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>DGCs, where relatively immature DGCs are located (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Aguilar-Arredondo et al., 2015</a>)."

DGCs were identified with a marker, Prox1 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Iwano et al., 2012</a>). In our hippocampal culture, initial formation of glutamatergic synapses starts from ~3 days in vitro (3DIV), followed by activity-dependent synapse maturation from ~8DIV to ~12DIV (<a href=\"#bib71\">Terauchi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Toth et al., 2013</a>).

                                "text": "Synapse formation can be separated into two stages: the initial synaptic differentiation stage and the synapse maturation stage. Initial synaptic differentiation is usually regarded as an activity-independent step, while synaptic maturation, including synaptic growth, elimination, and stabilization, is influenced by neural activity. Our previous report identified that activity-dependent refinement of DGC\u2013CA3 connections begins at ~P15 (<a href=\"#bib80\">Yasuda et al., 2011</a>), which is around when we observed decreased IGF2 expression in <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></i>\u00a0mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Thus, we next asked whether IGF2 expression, IGF2 localization, and/or IGF2 function for synaptogenesis require neural activity. With FGF22 treatment, IGF2 expression increased in the soma of cultured DGCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). Blockade of neural activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX) did not disturb the ability of FGF22 to increase IGF2 expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). We then examined the effect of TTX on presynaptic localization of IGF2. We found that TTX treatment reduced the clustering and synaptic localization of IGF2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C and D</a>). Finally, we assessed the requirement of neural activity in IGF2 function to induce presynaptic development. IGF2 overexpression increased synaptophysin-YFP accumulation in cultured DGCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E and F</a>). This increase was completely blocked by TTX treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E and F</a>). These results indicate that neural activity is not required for FGF22 to induce IGF2 expression, but is necessary for IGF2 to localize to and organize development of presynaptic terminals. To confirm that the activity of presynaptic neurons is critical for the localization and function of IGF2, we suppressed intrinsic neuronal excitability of DGCs by sparsely transfecting the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.1, in culture (<a href=\"#bib37\">Johnson-Venkatesh et al, 2015</a>). Similarly to the results with TTX, Kir2.1 expression in DGCs decreased the synaptic localization of IGF2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G and H</a>) and completely blocked the synaptogenic function of IGF2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I and J</a>). These results indicate that intrinsic neuronal excitability of DGCs is required for the presynaptic localization of IGF2 and its synaptogenic function."

Our previous analysis showed that in CA3 of <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>mice, synaptic connections are made, but synaptic vesicles fail to appropriately accumulate to the presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#bib71\">Terauchi et al., 2010</a>). In <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup> </i>cultures, the accumulation of glutamatergic synaptic vesicles, as assessed by the number and size of VGLUT1 (vesicular glutamate transporter 1) puncta, onto dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons is specifically impaired (<a href=\"#bib71\">Terauchi et al., 2010</a>; also see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We examined whether application of IGF2 could rescue the defects in synaptic vesicle accumulation in <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></i>\u00a0cultures. In WT cultures, bath application of IGF2 increased the clustering of glutamatergic synaptic vesicles on the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons at 13DIV (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>); consistent with this result, IGF2 overexpression increased synaptophysin-YFP puncta in DGCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E and F</a>). In <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>cultures, IGF2 application rescued the defects in VGLUT1 accumulation: the restored number and size of VGLUT1 puncta were comparable to those seen in IGF2-treated WT cultures (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). IGF2 treatment, as well as deficiency of FGF22, did not alter the clustering of VGAT (vesicular GABA transporter; a marker of GABAergic synaptic vesicles) on the dendrite of CA3 pyramidal neurons, indicating that IGF2 and FGF22 are not involved in inhibitory presynaptic development on CA3 pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In addition, IGF2 treatment and loss of FGF22 did not change the accumulation of postsynaptic markers, PSD95 (glutamatergic) and gephyrin (GABAergic), associated with CA3 pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C and D</a>). Altogether, IGF2 specifically rescues excitatory presynaptic defects in <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></i>\u00a0neurons, suggesting that IGF2 is a mediator of FGF22 signaling to promote excitatory presynaptic development on the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons."

Defects in excitatory synapse formation are observed in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice as early as P8, an early stage of synapse formation (<a href=\"#bib71\">Terauchi et al., 2010</a>). Meanwhile, decreased IGF2 expression was observed in <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice at P14, but not at P7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), and the effects of IGF2 on presynaptic development is activity-dependent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013F</a>). These results raise the possibility that IGF2 contributes to FGF22-dependent presynaptic development in a stage-specific manner: IGF2 is not required during the initial stage but is required during the following stage of synapse formation, i.e., activity-dependent synapse stabilization. To test this possibility, we employed an shRNA knockdown approach (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) to silence the expression of IGF2 in DGCs from 1DIV by using two independent shRNA plasmids. Knockdown of IGF2 did not apparently alter the morphology of DGCs (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We assessed synaptic vesicle (synaptophysin-YFP) accumulation in response to FGF22 in the axons of IGF2-knockdown DGCs (from 1DIV) during the initial presynaptic differentiation (6DIV) and subsequent presynaptic stabilization (12DIV) stages. At 6DIV, we did not observe any differences between IGF2-knockdown and control DGCs: the basal levels of synaptophysin-YFP accumulation were not different, and IGF2-knockdown DGCs still responded to FGF22 treatment to increase the accumulation of synaptophysin-YFP (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and B</a>). On the other hand, at 12DIV, the number and size of synaptophysin-YFP puncta were significantly decreased in IGF2-knockdown DGCs compared to those in controls (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C and D</a>). In addition, IGF2-knockdown DGCs no longer show FGF22-dependent increases in the accumulation of synaptophysin-YFP (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C and D</a>). These results suggest that IGF2 is not necessary for the initial presynaptic differentiation induced by FGF22, but is required for a later stage of presynaptic development. To confirm the role of IGF2 in the late stage of presynaptic development, we knocked down IGF2 from 6DIV and assessed presynaptic development at 12DIV. IGF2 knockdown from 6DIV decreased the number and size of presynaptic terminals (as assessed by synaptophysin-YFP accumulation) and blocked the synaptogenic effects of FGF22 at 12DIV (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E and F</a>), suggesting that IGF2 is indeed critical for the later stage of presynaptic stabilization."

In contrast, in the mammalian brain, such feedback pathways for presynaptic stabilization had not been identified.

                                "text": "An important next question is how IGF2 stabilizes presynaptic terminals. IGF2, which often acts as an autocrine factor (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pollak et al., 2004</a>), mediates its functions mainly via IGF2 receptor (IGF2R) as well as via IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fernandez and Torres-Aleman, 2012</a>). In neurons, both receptors are used to mediate IGF2 signal and participate in various physiological functions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Agis-Balboa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Schmeisser et al., 2012</a>). We showed that IGF2 is secreted and tethered on the surface of presynaptic terminals of DGCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). IGF2R (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement1</a>) and IGF1R (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gazit et al., 2016</a>) are also localized at presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that IGF2 is secreted from the presynaptic terminal and binds to IGF2R/IGF1R, which is also localized at the presynaptic terminal, so that IGF2 acts locally in an autocrine manner for its effects. Yet, we cannot exclude the possibility that IGF2 may also act as a global presynaptic organizer if IGF2 is released from the presynaptic terminal. IGF1R is a receptor tyrosine kinase, which may regulate local translation, and IGF2R is known to signal through G proteins, which may ultimately affect calcium homeostasis. Calcium homeostasis and local translation of synaptic proteins, as well as regulation of cytoskeletal structures like Trio may all contribute to IGF2-dependent presynaptic stabilization."

It has been proposed that active synapses are stabilized and inactive ones are destabilized (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lichtman and Colman, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ruthazer and Cline, 2004</a>). Various forms of activity are involved: in most cases, synaptic transmission and synaptic competition are considered critical for synapse refinement (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lichtman and Colman, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Waites et al., 2005</a>). In addition, intrinsic activity also plays critical roles in synapse development (<a href=\"#bib37\">Johnson-Venkatesh et al., 2015</a>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which intrinsic activity contributes to synapse stabilization during development are largely unknown. We found that IGF2's function in synaptic stabilization requires intrinsic neuronal activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). IGF2 is not transported to presynaptic terminals when intrinsic neuronal excitability of DGCs is suppressed. Thus, our results reveal that IGF2 is a mediator of intrinsic activity-dependent presynaptic stabilization. Since IGF2's effects are for the stabilization of synaptic vesicles but not for the initial recruitment of synaptic vesicles (which is carried out by FGF22), it is reasonable that TTX/Kir2.1 did not affect synaptic vesicle transportation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

Neural activity also modulates phosphorylation of the C terminal domain of KIF3A, which affects loading of N-cadherin containing cargos and contributes to the maintenance of homeostatic synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ichinose et al., 2015</a>).

Thus, in addition to transportation, secretion of IGF2 at presynaptic sites might also be controlled by neural activity. If this is the case, one may speculate that activity blockade would increase the intracellular IGF2 levels. However, we did not observe an increase in the intracellular IGF2 levels, probably because neural activity is also critical for IGF2 transportation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

IGF2 also contributes to adult neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bracko et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ouchi et al., 2013</a>). For neuronal development, IGF2 leads to nerve sprouting (<a href=\"#bib14\">Caroni and Grandes, 1990</a>), neurite outgrowth (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jeong et al., 2013</a>), as well as spine maturation in cultured hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib65\">Schmeisser et al., 2012</a>).

FGF22-dependent IGF2 expression was observed in young, calretinin-positive DGCs, but not in mature, calbindin-positive DGCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). Specific responsiveness of calretinin-positive DGCs to FGF22 appears to be linked to the developmental stage. Calretinin-positive DGCs elongate axons to CA3 and contact CA3 pyramidal neurons to form synapses (<a href=\"#bib6\">Aguilar-Arredondo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ming and Song, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Yasuda et al., 2011</a>). Thus, around that stage, DGCs may become more responsive to FGF22. Our results are consistent with the idea that IGF2 is induced by CA3-derived FGF22 when DGC axons contact with their target dendrites. The data from CA3-selective <i>Fgf22</i> knockout mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and the local FGF22 application experiments, in which IGF2 was induced by axonal application of FGF22 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2013I</a>), further support this idea. Our results also suggest that IGF2 is not critical for initial synaptic differentiation, because no defects were found in the absence of IGF2 at 6DIV in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>) or P8 in vivo (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). However, it is important for the later stages of synapse development: after 6DIV in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>) and P14 in vivo (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), when neural activity influences synapse formation (<a href=\"#bib73\">Toth et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Yasuda et al., 2011</a>). As IGF2 effects are activity dependent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), we propose that IGF2, induced by target-derived FGF22, is mainly important for the stages of activity-dependent synapse stabilization."

CA3 pyramidal neurons, which release FGF22, receive excitatory synaptic inputs from collateral/associational CA3 pyramidal neurons and stellate cells in the entorhinal cortex, in addition to inputs from DGCs (<a href=\"#bib75\">Urban et al., 2001</a>). However, CA3 neurons do not respond to FGF22 to induce IGF2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Since <i>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice show defects in excitatory synapse formation both in the SL (where DGC to CA3 synapses are located) as well as SR (where CA3 to CA3 synapses are located) (<a href=\"#bib71\">Terauchi et al., 2010</a>), the lack of IGF2 induction in CA3 neurons indicates that IGF2 is a unique target of FGF22 specifically in differentiating DGCs. It is possible that CA3 neurons express genes other than IGF2 in an FGF22-dependent manner for presynaptic stabilization. If so, different types of presynaptic neurons might process FGF22 signaling through their own transcription regulation to promote neuron type-specific presynaptic stabilization."

Neuroligins in cerebellar Purkinje cells have a role in the formation of climbing fiber synapses, but not parallel-fiber synapses (<a href=\"#bib81\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Cadherin-9 is involved in the formation and differentiation of DGC\u2013CA3 synapses, but not CA3\u2013CA3 synapses (<a href=\"#bib78\">Williams et al., 2011</a>). Neuroligin2 regulates inhibitory synaptic function in a pathway-specific manner (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gibson et al., 2009</a>). Thus, it appears that there are input specific synaptic organizers that cooperate to establish precise networks in the brain. Our work on IGF2, which is specific to DGC\u2013CA3 synapses, would add an example of how our brain utilizes specific molecules to emerge synapse specificity."

Our preliminary screen suggests that FGF22 and FGF7 may regulate distinct molecules in excitatory (DGCs) vs. inhibitory neurons for synapse stabilization, because <i>Igf2</i> was not identified as a target gene of FGF7."

The authors previously showed that target-derived FGF22 promoted presynaptic differentiation of excitatory synapses between dentate gyrus granule cells (DGCs) and CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus (Terauchi et al., Nature 2010). They also showed that another target-derived factor, SIRP\u03b1, regulated synapse maturation of DGCs during postnatal weeks 2-4 (Toth et al., Nat Neurosci 2013). In this manuscript, the authors report decreased IGF2 expression in calretinin-positive DGCs in total and CA3-specific FGF22-null mice in vivo, and that bath and local application of FGF22 induced expression of IGF2 specifically in calretinin-positive immature DGCs in vitro. Overexpressed IGF2-EGFP localized to DGC axons in an activity-dependent manner and promoted presynaptic differentiation, as measured by accumulation of synaptophysin-YFP. In addition, treatment with IGF2 restored excitatory presynapse differentiation in FGF22-null CA3 neurons in vitro without changes in postsynaptic markers. FGF22-dependent accumulation of synaptophysin-YFP in cultured wild-type DGCs required IGF2 only after 6DIV. Finally, excitatory synapses were reduced in IGF2-null calretinin-positive DGCs in vivo. From these data, authors conclude that target-derived FGF2 induces expression of IGF2, which is critical for the activity-dependent stabilization of DGC presynaptic terminals on CA3 neurons. It has not been clear whether and how target-derived molecules control gene transcription and stabilization of presynaptic terminals in the mammalian CNS. This study that sheds light on the novel role of FGF22-induced IGF2 in activity-dependent stabilization of presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus. However, several key issues need to be addressed to support the authors' claim."

As the same authors classified previously (Toth et al., Nat Neurosci 2013), three different stages of synapse development can be defined for DGC-CA3 synapses: P0-P14, initial synapse differentiation; P15-P29, synapse maturation; P30-P44, synapse maintenance. In most experiments, authors examined the effect of IGF2 at 10DIV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>) or 13DIV (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Indeed, IGF2 is highly expressed in calretinin-positive DGCs, which mostly correspond to neurons born 3-17.5 days ago (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Thus, IGF2 appears to be a molecule that regulates initial synapse \"differentiation\" after FGF22. The authors claim that IGF2 is dispensable for initial presynaptic differentiation, but critical for presynaptic stabilization based on <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. However, in this experiment, FGF22 was applied to hippocampal neurons transfected with shRNA against IGF2 at 1DIV and examined at 6DIV or 12DIV. FGF22-induced synaptophysin accumulation was observed in neurons fixed at 6DIV, but not those at 12DIV. However, prolonged knockdown of IGF2 could have non-specific effects on neurons, such as reduction of synaptic vesicles and reduced expression of FGF receptors. To examine the role of IGF2 at later synapse developmental stages, the authors need to knockdown IGF2 at later time points."

However, IGF2 immunoreactivity remained unaffected in calbindin-positive DGCs in FGF22-null mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), indicating that IGF2 can be expressed in an FGF-independent manner. Many questions remain unanswered here. What determines the specific responsiveness of calretinin-positive DGCs to FGF22? How is IGF2 expressed in calbindin-positive DGCs in FGF22-null mice? What roles does IGF2 play in calbindin-positive DGCs? Why do DGCs express IGF2 by two different pathways (i.e., FGF22-dependent and independent) at different developmental stages? The authors need to provide some explanations. In most of the vitro experiments, the authors examined the roles of IGF2 on presynaptic differentiation in prox1-positive DGCs, which includes many calretinin-negative DGCs. Considering that FGF22-induced IGF2 expression was specifically observed in calretinin-positive DGCs, the authors need to focus on these cells, or at least show what percentage of their cultured neurons corresponds to calretinin-positive DGCs."

First, it is unclear where and how IGF2 is located on presynaptic sites. Is overexpressed IGF2-EGFP localized on the surface of presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)? If so, depending on where and how IGF2 is released, IGF2 should not be considered as a local, but a global, presynaptic organizer. Second, it is unclear where and how neuronal activity is required for the effect of IGF2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). If IGF2 is secreted by neuronal activity as the authors suggest in the Discussion, why didn\u2019t tetrodotoxin (TTX) treatment increase intracellular IGF2 levels? IGF2 may be transported to presynaptic terminals by neuronal activity, but why didn\u2019t TTX treatment affect transport of synaptic vesicles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>)? Neuronal activity may affect the exocytosis/endocytosis ratio or stabilization of IGF2 in axons. It is also possible that TTX treatment for 7 days from 1DIV may change expression of various genes that affect axon branching and expression of IGF2 receptors. Changes in postsynaptic neuronal activity may also contribute to presynaptic accumulation of synaptophsyin-YFP by some other mechanisms. These issues require further clarification and discussion."

The authors need to show that mossy fiber-evoked EPSC(P)s are specifically affected in IGF2-null mice. In addition, changes in presynaptic differentiation should be assessed by paired-pulse stimulation of specific input fibers. Electron microscopic analyses of pre- and postsynaptic structures of DGC-CA3 synapses in IGF2-null mice would also strengthen the authors' argument."

As the same authors classified previously (Toth et al., Nat Neurosci 2013), three different stages of synapse development can be defined for DGC-CA3 synapses: P0-P14, initial synapse differentiation; P15-P29, synapse maturation; P30-P44, synapse maintenance. In most experiments, authors examined the effect of IGF2 at 10DIV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>) or 13DIV (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Indeed, IGF2 is highly expressed in calretinin-positive DGCs, which mostly correspond to neurons born 3-17.5 days ago (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Thus, IGF2 appears to be a molecule that regulates initial synapse \"differentiation\" after FGF22. The authors claim that IGF2 is dispensable for initial presynaptic differentiation, but critical for presynaptic stabilization based on <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. However, in this experiment, FGF22 was applied to hippocampal neurons transfected with shRNA against IGF2 at 1DIV and examined at 6DIV or 12DIV. FGF22-induced synaptophysin accumulation was observed in neurons fixed at 6DIV, but not those at 12DIV. However, prolonged knockdown of IGF2 could have non-specific effects on neurons, such as reduction of synaptic vesicles and reduced expression of FGF receptors. To examine the role of IGF2 at later synapse developmental stages, the authors need to knockdown IGF2 at later time points.</i> We appreciate the comment. In our previous papers, we have defined the stages of synapse development based on its dependence on neural activity: in the hippocampus, synapse development from P0 to ~P14 is not apparently influenced by neural activity (\"initial synapse differentiation\"), but that from ~P14 to ~P28 is regulated by activity, where we found that activity-dependent synapse maturation (e.g., mediated by SIRP; Toth et al., 2013) and activity-dependent synapse elimination (Yasuda et al., 2011) take place. Because the effects of IGF2 are dependent on neural activity, we proposed that IGF2 is critical for \"synapse maturation/stabilization\" in the manuscript. As suggested, we have further examined the role of IGF2 at later stages of synapse development both in vitro and in vivo."

Since IGF2 knockdown from DIV1-DIV6 did not affect presynaptic terminals or synaptogenic effects of FGF22 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and B</a>), our result suggests that IGF2 is indeed critical for a later stage of synapse development (after DIV6).
