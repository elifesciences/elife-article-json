Indeed, it is established that the ubiquitously expressed JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms regulate energy expenditure and insulin resistance. However, the role of the neuron-specific isoform JNK3 is unclear. Here we demonstrate that JNK3 deficiency causes hyperphagia selectively in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. JNK3 deficiency in neurons that express the leptin receptor LEPRb was sufficient to cause HFD-dependent hyperphagia. Studies of sub-groups of leptin-responsive neurons demonstrated that JNK3 deficiency in AgRP neurons, but not POMC neurons, was sufficient to cause the hyperphagic response. These effects of JNK3 deficiency were associated with enhanced excitatory signaling by AgRP neurons in HFD-fed mice. JNK3 therefore provides a mechanism that contributes to homeostatic regulation of energy balance in response to metabolic stress."

Indeed, it is established that the ubiquitously expressed JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms regulate energy expenditure and insulin resistance. However, the role of the neuron-specific isoform JNK3 is unclear. Here we demonstrate that JNK3 deficiency causes hyperphagia selectively in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. JNK3 deficiency in neurons that express the leptin receptor LEPRb was sufficient to cause HFD-dependent hyperphagia. Studies of sub-groups of leptin-responsive neurons demonstrated that JNK3 deficiency in AgRP neurons, but not POMC neurons, was sufficient to cause the hyperphagic response. These effects of JNK3 deficiency were associated with enhanced excitatory signaling by AgRP neurons in HFD-fed mice. JNK3 therefore provides a mechanism that contributes to homeostatic regulation of energy balance in response to metabolic stress."

Mice that lacked JNK3 ate far more food and gained more weight on a high fat diet than normal mice. However, JNK3 played no role in food consumption when mice were fed a standard chow diet. Treating normal mice with leptin \u2013 an appetite-suppressing hormone \u2013 caused them to lose weight, but did not affect mice that lacked JNK3."

Similarly, sustained positive energy balance caused by hyperphagia results in obesity associated with severe metabolic disorders (e.g. type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hepatitis, neurodegeneration and cancer) that represent leading causes of morbidity and mortality (<a href=\"#bib21\">Flegal et al., 2013</a>).

AgRP neurons in the ARC mediate orexigenic signals, including neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that project to POMC neurons in the ARC and to secondary response neurons in many brain regions, including the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. In contrast, POMC neurons mediate anorexigenic signals, including cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived \u03b1-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH). POMC neurons project to many brain areas, including the PVN and LH in the hypothalamus where \u03b1-MSH acts as an agonist of the melanocortin receptors MC3R and MC4R on secondary response neurons to inhibit feeding and increase energy expenditure. Importantly, this action of \u03b1-MSH is antagonized by AgRP. Moreover, POMC neurons receive inhibitory GABAergic input from AgRP neurons. Consequently, AgRP and POMC neurons act together to balance food consumption, energy expenditure and nutrient homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cone, 2005</a>)."

Thus, leptin activates POMC neurons (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cowley et al., 2001</a>) and inhibits AgRP neurons (<a href=\"#bib48\">Takahashi and Cone, 2005</a>) leading to reduced food consumption and increased energy expenditure.

Leptin can act directly on AgRP and POMC neurons, but leptin can also act on other neurons in several brain sub-regions, including mid-brain and brainstem nuclei (<a href=\"#bib47\">Scott et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Patterson et al., 2011</a>). Control of leptin signaling in these neurons is important for maintaining energy balance. For example, obesity causes an increase in the blood concentration of leptin, most likely because of increased adipose tissue mass. The increased leptin concentration can lead to tachyphylaxis and suppression of the anorexigenic actions of leptin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Frederich et al., 1995</a>). This mechanism enables homeostatic regulation of feeding behavior in response to metabolic stress. Whether this mechanism represents \u201cleptin resistance\u201d is unclear (<a href=\"#bib36\">Myers et al., 2010</a>) because some biochemical aspects of leptin signaling are maintained in the obese state (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ottaway et al., 2015</a>). A requirement for leptin signaling may reflect the role of the leptin-stimulated JAK2-STAT3 pathway to increase expression of the negative regulator SOCS3 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allison and Myers, 2014</a>). Negative regulation of leptin signaling may also involve the tyrosine phosphatases PTPN1 and PTPN2 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bence et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Loh et al., 2011</a>), reactive oxygen species (<a href=\"#bib19\">Diano et al., 2011</a>), the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ozcan et al., 2009</a>), autophagy (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kaushik et al., 2011</a>), and low-grade inflammation (<a href=\"#bib17\">de Git and Adan, 2015</a>)."

However, loss-of-function studies have not identified a role for JNK in the control of food consumption. Here we demonstrate that the neuronal isoform JNK3 (encoded by the <i>Mapk10</i> gene) plays a key role in the maintenance of energy balance during consumption of a high fat diet (HFD) by promoting leptin signaling. <i>Mapk10</i> gene ablation studies identify AgRP neurons as a site of JNK3 function.

We therefore examined miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) of AgRP neurons in the ARC of WT and <i>Mapk10<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. This analysis demonstrated that JNK3 deficiency caused no change in mIPSC frequency or amplitude in CD-fed and HFD-fed mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a>). Similarly, JNK3 deficiency caused no change in mEPSC frequency or amplitude in CD-fed mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013H</a>). In contrast, HFD-fed JNK3-deficient mice demonstrated increased mEPSC amplitudes in the absence of changes in mEPSC frequency (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013H</a>). Studies using the selective antagonist DNQX demonstrated that these mEPSC currents were mediated by AMPA receptors in AgRP neurons (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</a>). Together, these data indicate that JNK3 deficiency leads to altered excitatory transmission onto AgRP neurons compared to WT mice when fed a HFD.

Since JNK1 and JNK2 are expressed ubiquitously, the expression of JNK3 by neurons means that these cells express all three JNK isoforms (<a href=\"#bib16\">Davis, 2000</a>). To examine the role of JNK in neurons, the effects of ablation of the three genes that encode JNK (<i>Mapk8, Mapk9</i>, and <i>Mapk10</i>) in neurons have been examined. This analysis demonstrated that compound JNK-deficiency caused markedly increased survival responses associated with increased autophagy (<a href=\"#bib56\">Xu et al., 2011</a>). Roles for individual JNK isoforms in neurons have also been studied (<a href=\"#bib12\">Coffey, 2014</a>). JNK1 and, to some extent JNK2, are constitutively activated and are primarily localized to axons and dendrites (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coffey et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Oliva et al., 2006</a>) where they play a major role in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and axonal/dendritic morphology (<a href=\"#bib12\">Coffey, 2014</a>). In contrast, JNK3 exhibits low basal activity and is activated in the nucleus when neurons are exposed to stress (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yang et al., 1997</a>).

The mechanism of JNK3 function requires metabolic stress (e.g. feeding a HFD) to cause JNK3 activation. This distinguishes the JNK3 deficiency phenotype from other negative regulators of leptin signaling. Thus, JNK3 deficiency does not cause hyperphagia when mice are fed a chow diet, but JNK3 deficiency does cause hyperphagia when mice are fed a HFD. In contrast, PTPN1-deficiency causes hypophagia on both CD and HFD (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bence et al., 2006</a>). This analysis indicates that JNK3 is not required for fine-tuning leptin receptor signaling, but JNK3 is essential for determining the leptin signaling response during exposure to metabolic stress. JNK3 therefore serves a key role in the establishment of the set-point for the threshold of leptin signaling that controls feeding behavior in response to metabolic stress."

Our recordings measured glutamatergic transmission from all inputs to AgRP neurons and demonstrated an increase in mEPSC amplitude, but not frequency, from HFD-fed JNK3-deficient mice compared with HFD-fed control mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This observation is consistent with a possible postsynaptic function of JNK3 in AgRP neurons whereby JNK3 affects AMPA and/or NMDA receptor activity within these neurons. Interestingly, glutamatergic input to AgRP neurons stimulates feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Previous studies have established functional connections between the JNK signaling pathway and glutamatergic receptor signaling in neurons. For example, the JNK scaffold proteins JIP1/2 can regulate NMDA receptor signaling (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kennedy et al., 2007</a>) and AMPA receptor phosphorylation by JNK regulates AMPA receptor function and trafficking (<a href=\"#bib49\">Thomas et al., 2008</a>). Further studies are required to identify the complete spectrum of JNK3 targets in AgRP neurons. Nevertheless, since an increased AMPA response was detected in JNK3-deficient AgRP neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</a>), we conclude that JNK-mediated AMPA receptor regulation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Thomas et al., 2008</a>) may contribute to the hyperphagic phenotype of HFD-fed JNK3-deficient mice."

This function of JNK3 to regulate feeding behavior differs from the roles of JNK1/JNK2 to regulate energy expenditure and insulin resistance (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sabio and Davis, 2010</a>). These conclusions are based on loss-of-function studies. A contrasting conclusion has been reported based on gain-of-function studies using transgenic expression of a MKK7-JNK1 fusion protein (that mimics constitutively activated JNK1) in AgRP neurons that causes a small increase in food consumption by CD-fed mice (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tsaousidou et al., 2014</a>). Since JNK1-deficient (<i>Mapk8<sup>-/-</sup></i>) mice do not exhibit altered feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sabio et al., 2008</a>) and endogenous JNK1 is constitutively activated in neurons (<a href=\"#bib12\">Coffey, 2014</a>), it is unclear why transgenic over-expression of an activated <i>Mapk8</i> allele (encoding a MKK7-JNK1 fusion protein) in WT mice would cause a small change in feeding behavior. However, the pro-apoptotic function of this activated <i>Mapk8</i> allele (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lei et al., 2002</a>) may cause defects in hypothalamic neuronal circuits that contribute to the reported phenotype. On balance, we favor the conclusion that JNK1 and JNK2 do not influence feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sabio and Davis, 2010</a>), but JNK3 promotes leptin-mediated suppression of HFD feeding behavior (when JNK3 is activated), but not CD feeding behavior (when JNK3 is inactive)."

However, this study demonstrates that JNK3 inhibition causes HFD-dependent hyperphagia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). This represents a potential problem for drug therapy. While JNK1/2 inhibition may be therapeutically beneficial, hyperphagia may therefore result from JNK3 inhibition. Consequently, the most effective drug strategy for the treatment of pre-diabetes may require a small molecule that inhibits JNK1/2, but not JNK3."

The obesity is associated with elevated leptin, elevated insulin, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and many other parameters associated with obesity. The most important contribution is their systematic demonstration that the phenotype of global KO of the gene encoding JNK3 is replicated quite well by KO only in AgRP neurons. The authors go on to explore how loss of JNK3 function in AgRP neurons might lead to the hyperphagic obese phenotype, but those studies are less compelling."

They attribute this hypo-sensitivity to a reduced level of Lepr mRNA (about half normal). They show that phospho-cJun (transcription factor) normally binds to an AP1 site in the promoter of Lepr gene and hence the lack of phosphorylation of c-Jun could impair transcription of Lepr gene. There are two problems with this analysis: (a) The Lepr mRNA (rather than protein) measurements were made in hypothalamic samples, not in AgRP neurons where it is relevant. (b) Complete loss of Lepr in AgRP neurons has a relatively small effect on obesity and heterozygous Lepr db/+ mice (with half the normal level of Lepr mRNA) do not become more obese on a HFD than WT mice. Thus, it seems unlikely that reduced levels of LepR account for the obesity observed in this JNK3 KO model."

They show that mEPSCs amplitude in AgRP neurons is enhanced in slices, suggestive of enhanced excitatory signaling within AgRP neurons. If this enhanced excitability extends to in vivo situation, then that could drive the hyperphagia and ultimately the obesity. Thus, I suggest that the authors do whatever they can to demonstrate that AgRP neurons are hyperactive in vivo. First they need to demonstrate that the mice are hyperphagic <i>before</i> they become obese. The experiment in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> was performed after there was already a difference in body weight. A pair-feeding experiment would also be useful to demonstrate that the obesity is due to hyperphagia. Looking for markers of enhanced neuronal activity in AgRP neurons (e.g. Fos) might also be revealing. However, the ultimate experiment would be to use in vivo recording or calcium imaging of AgRP neurons \u2013 techniques that are available to this group."

They show that the loss of the neuronally expressed JNK3 is associated with increased obesity due to increased food consumption. This is brought about by the elimination of JNK3 in leptin receptor expressing neurons. They narrow this down further by doing an AgRP-specific elimination and compare that to a POMC neuronal-specific elimination. They demonstrate hyperphagia to be present in only Agrp-specific nulls for JNK3. They go on to demonstrate that this is in fact due at least in part due to reduced leptin receptor expression on AgRP-neurons. All of this happens exclusively in the context of high fat diet exposure."

Overall, the metabolic studies convincingly show that JNK3 deficiency increases HFD-induced weight gain, hyperphagia, adipose hypertrophy, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. The logical set of cell-type-selective JNK3 deletions provides compelling evidence that JNK3 actions specifically in AgRP neurons are necessary to reduce HFD-induced weight gain.

It is important to know that mIPSCs don't also increase and how the deletion affects basal regulation of POMC neurons. In Figure 7, the overall JNK3 knockout was used and thus, it is not possible to determine if leptin receptor expression is also reduced in POMC cells or rather, if maybe POMC cells do not express JNK3 or require JNK3 to bolster leptin sensitivity. In my opinion, these last 2 experiments do not need to be included to support the conclusions made, but if they are included, they need to be done more thoroughly so that they can be better interpreted."

The obesity is associated with elevated leptin, elevated insulin, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and many other parameters associated with obesity. The most important contribution is their systematic demonstration that the phenotype of global KO of the gene encoding JNK3 is replicated quite well by KO only in AgRP neurons. The authors go on to explore how loss of JNK3 function in AgRP neurons might lead to the hyperphagic obese phenotype, but those studies are less compelling. 1) The authors show that leptin receptors can be activated (phosphorylated) in the JNK3 KO but the dose-response is apparently shifted \u2013 LepR is fully activated (phosphorylated) with 2.5 mg/kg leptin but only partially activated with 0.1 mg/kg (Figure 7B). They attribute this hypo-sensitivity to a reduced level of Lepr mRNA (about half normal). They show that phospho-cJun (transcription factor) normally binds to an AP1 site in the promoter of Lepr gene and hence the lack of phosphorylation of c-Jun could impair transcription of Lepr gene. There are two problems with this analysis: (a) The Lepr mRNA (rather than protein) measurements were made in hypothalamic samples, not in AgRP neurons where it is relevant. (b) Complete loss of Lepr in AgRP neurons has a relatively small effect on obesity and heterozygous Lepr db/+ mice (with half the normal level of Lepr mRNA) do not become more obese on a HFD than WT mice. Thus, it seems unlikely that reduced levels of LepR account for the obesity observed in this JNK3 KO model.</i>"

If this enhanced excitability extends to in vivo situation, then that could drive the hyperphagia and ultimately the obesity.

The experiment in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> was performed after there was already a difference in body weight. A pair-feeding experiment would also be useful to demonstrate that the obesity is due to hyperphagia.

In Figure 7, the overall JNK3 knockout was used and thus, it is not possible to determine if leptin receptor expression is also reduced in POMC cells or rather, if maybe POMC cells do not express JNK3 or require JNK3 to bolster leptin sensitivity.
