We report here an analysis of its direct transcriptional program using Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq). Shortly after MDM2 inhibition by Nutlin-3, low levels of p53 rapidly activate \u223c200 genes, most of them not previously established as direct targets. This immediate response involves all canonical p53 effector pathways, including apoptosis. Comparative global analysis of RNA synthesis vs steady state levels revealed that microarray profiling fails to identify low abundance transcripts directly activated by p53. Interestingly, p53 represses a subset of its activation targets before MDM2 inhibition. GRO-seq uncovered a plethora of gene-specific regulatory features affecting key survival and apoptotic genes within the p53 network. p53 regulates hundreds of enhancer-derived RNAs. Strikingly, direct p53 targets harbor pre-activated enhancers highly transcribed in p53 null cells. Altogether, these results enable the study of many uncharacterized p53 target genes and unexpected regulatory mechanisms."

We report here an analysis of its direct transcriptional program using Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq). Shortly after MDM2 inhibition by Nutlin-3, low levels of p53 rapidly activate \u223c200 genes, most of them not previously established as direct targets. This immediate response involves all canonical p53 effector pathways, including apoptosis. Comparative global analysis of RNA synthesis vs steady state levels revealed that microarray profiling fails to identify low abundance transcripts directly activated by p53. Interestingly, p53 represses a subset of its activation targets before MDM2 inhibition. GRO-seq uncovered a plethora of gene-specific regulatory features affecting key survival and apoptotic genes within the p53 network. p53 regulates hundreds of enhancer-derived RNAs. Strikingly, direct p53 targets harbor pre-activated enhancers highly transcribed in p53 null cells. Altogether, these results enable the study of many uncharacterized p53 target genes and unexpected regulatory mechanisms."

In the absence of activating signals, p53 is repressed by the oncoproteins MDM2 and MDM4. MDM2 masks the transactivation domain of p53 and is also an E3 ligase that targets p53 for degradation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Momand et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Oliner et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kubbutat et al., 1997</a>). MDM4 lacks E3 ligase activity, but represses p53 transactivation potential (<a href=\"#bib35\">Riemenschneider et al., 1999</a>). Diverse signaling pathways converge on the p53/MDM2/MDM4 complex to release p53 from its repressors and enable it to regulate transcription of downstream target genes involved in cellular responses such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, autophagy, DNA repair and central metabolism (<a href=\"#bib45\">Vousden and Prives, 2009</a>). p53 is inactivated in virtually all human cancers, either by mutations in its DNA binding domain or MDM2/MDM4 overexpression. Significant advances have been made to develop p53-based targeted therapies (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brown et al., 2009</a>). One class of small molecules targets the interaction between p53 and its repressors, thus bypassing the need of stress signaling to trigger p53 activation. For example, Nutlin-3, the first-in-class compound, binds to the hydrophobic pocket in MDM2 required for binding to p53, thus acting as a competitive inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib44\">Vassilev et al., 2004</a>). A second class of molecules binds to mutant p53 and partially restores its wild type function (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brown et al., 2009</a>). As these compounds enter clinical trials, their efficacy is limited by the fact that p53 activation leads to cancer cell death only in specific scenarios. Thus, there is a clear need to understand how these molecules modulate p53 function and how cell fate choice upon p53 activation is defined. A missing piece in this effort is a definitive elucidation of the direct p53 transcriptome."

The protein domains required for DNA binding and transactivation are well characterized, as well as its DNA response elements (p53REs) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Laptenko and Prives, 2006</a>). A recent comprehensive survey of the literature identified \u223c120 genes for which direct regulation has been established (<a href=\"#bib36\">Riley et al., 2008</a>), but a comprehensive analysis of p53-regulated RNAs is still missing. Up to this point, the global p53 transcriptional response has been investigated with techniques that measure steady state RNA levels, mostly microarray profiling. These methods require long time points to observe a significant change in the expression of p53-regulated RNAs, which confounds direct vs indirect effects, and additional experiments are required to ascertain direct transcriptional regulation. A popular approach has been to cross-reference microarray data with p53 binding data derived from ChIP-seq assays. Meta-analysis of four recent papers using this strategy indicates that p53 may directly activate &gt;1200 genes, yet only 26 of these genes were commonly activated in all four studies (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nikulenkov et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Menendez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Schlereth et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2013</a>) (see later, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It is unclear to what extent this lack of overlap is due to methodological differences and/or cell type-specific differences in direct p53 action vs post-transcriptional regulation."

Using Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Core et al., 2008</a>), we ascertained direct regulation by using a short time point of Nutlin-3 treatment in isogenic cell lines with or without p53. Strikingly, Nutlin leads to p53-dependent transcriptional activation of hundreds of genomic loci prior to any significant increase in total p53 levels, thus highlighting the critical role of MDM2 in masking the p53 transactivation domain. Comparative global analysis of RNA synthesis by GRO-seq vs RNA steady state levels by microarray revealed that many p53 target genes transcribed at low levels are missed by microarray experiments. Strikingly, p53 represses the basal expression of a subset of its target genes before MDM2 inhibition. GRO-seq uncovered many gene-specific transcriptional events affecting key survival and apoptotic genes within the network, including the occurrence of bidirectional promoters (both overlapping and non-overlapping), clustered transactivation and various forms of antisense transcription. GRO-seq revealed widespread activation of enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs) arising from p53REs. Interestingly, direct p53 target genes harbor \u2018pre-activated\u2019 p53REs, as defined by the strong production of eRNAs in the isogenic p53 null cells. These results elucidate novel p53-regulated RNAs as well as gene-specific regulatory events within the p53 network and pave the road for a myriad of future mechanistic studies."

                                "text": "In order to study the direct transcriptional response upon p53 activation, we performed GRO-seq in isogenic HCT116 p53 +/+ and p53 \u2212/\u2212 cell lines. After several hours of treatment with 10 \u03bcM Nutlin-3a (referred hereto as Nutlin), only p53 +/+ cells undergo cell cycle arrest and display induction of many known p53 target genes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tovar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Henry et al., 2012</a>). Using GRO-seq, we investigated the effects of Nutlin vs vehicle (DMSO) in both cell lines under conditions of exponential cell proliferation, when p53 levels are low and cell cultures display virtually no signs of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. To minimize the possibility of measuring indirect effects, we chose a 1 hr time point of Nutlin treatment. Typical GRO-seq results are shown for two well-characterized p53 target genes, <i>CDKN1A</i> (<i>p21</i>) and <i>TP53I3</i> (<i>PIG3</i>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">el-Deiry et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Polyak et al., 1997</a>), which display significant increase in GRO-seq signals upon Nutlin treatment only in HCT116 p53 +/+ cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, respectively). Not surprisingly, Q-RT-PCR demonstrates that the steady state expression of the CDKN1A and TP53I3 mRNAs does not increase at the 1 hr time point as used for GRO-seq (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In fact, a significant increase in the steady state levels of both mRNAs requires several hours of p53 activation. Furthermore, Western blot analysis shows that 1 hr of Nutlin treatment does not increase total p53 or p21 protein levels to a significant degree (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Analysis of cell cycle progression using BrdU incorporation assays shows no signs of cell cycle arrest at the 1 hr time point, but a clear reduction in S phase cells is evident at 12 hr only in the p53 +/+ cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Overall, these observations indicate that our GRO-seq analysis using a 1 hr time point of p53 activation would largely preclude secondary effects driven by well-established direct p53 target genes, such as <i>CDKN1A</i> and <i>TP53I3</i>, thus enabling the identification of the direct p53 transcriptome."

                                "text": "Next, we used the DESeq algorithm (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anders and Huber, 2010</a>) to identify annotated gene loci whose transcription is significantly changed upon Nutlin treatment (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). Using a cut-off of adjusted <i>p(a)</i> &lt;0.1, we identified 198 gene loci whose transcription is significantly induced upon Nutlin treatment in p53 +/+ cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). This analysis identified only four gene loci whose transcription was diminished in the p53 +/+ cells (<i>FLVCR2</i>, <i>NR4A3</i>, <i>RELB</i> and <i>EGR1</i>); however, none of these genes showed reductions in steady state mRNA levels upon prolonged p53 activation (see later, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The specificity of Nutlin is demonstrated by the negligible changes observed in p53 \u2212/\u2212 cells, where our analysis identified 5 induced and 2 repressed genes, all of which have less than 1.5-fold changes and none of which was among those differentially transcribed in p53 +/+ cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). From this point forth, we focused on the 198 genes activated in the p53 +/+ cells, which we considered to be the direct p53 transcriptional program in this cell type. The notion that these genes are indeed direct p53 targets is reinforced by the observation that most of them (176 out of 198) show an increase in transcription as early as 30 min after Nutlin addition to the cell culture (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Of these 198 genes, 55 were known validated direct p53 targets, 66 were targets predicted by one or more published microarray/ChIP-seq studies, and 77 are putative novel direct p53 targets (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, a comprehensive annotation of these genes is provided in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Q-RT-PCR validation showed that novel genes are induced at a 12 hr time point of Nutlin treatment at the mRNA steady state level to a degree comparable to those genes predicted by published microarray/ChIP-seq studies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Furthermore, 12 out of the 14 novel p53 target genes tested are also induced at the mRNA steady state level when using doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging agent that activates p53 via stress signaling cascades (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lowe et al., 1994</a>), thus revealing that transactivation of most novel genes is not unique to pharmacological inhibition of MDM2 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Finally, we investigated whether activation of novel p53 targets can also be observed at the protein level. Indeed, Western blot analysis demonstrates protein induction for the novel genes GRIN2C, PTCDH4 and RINL (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Thus, our GRO-seq experiment clearly expands the universe of direct p53 target genes, paving the road for mechanistic studies investigating the function of these genes in the p53 network."

                                "text": "Although it is known that MDM2 represses p53 by both masking its transactivation domain and also targeting it for degradation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Momand et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Oliner et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kubbutat et al., 1997</a>), it has been difficult to dissect to what extent each mechanism contributes to repression of p53 target genes in diverse functional categories. Studies employing steady state mRNA measurements concluded that prolonged p53 activation and/or higher levels of cellular p53 were required for activation of apoptotic genes, some of which display delayed kinetics of induction at the mRNA steady state level as compared to cell cycle arrest genes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhao et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Szak et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Espinosa et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Das et al., 2007</a>). However, GRO-seq demonstrates that a 1 hr time point of Nutlin treatment induces transcription of genes in every major pathway downstream of p53 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The observation that key survival and apoptotic genes (e.g., <i>CDKN1A</i>, <i>TP53I3</i>) show greater than sixfold increase in transcription at a time point preceding a proportional increase in total p53 levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), suggests that the mere unmasking of the p53 transactivation domain suffices to activate a multifaceted transcriptional program. To further test this notion, we performed flow cytometry analyses using a monoclonal antibody (DO-1) that recognizes an epitope in the p53 N-terminal transactivation domain 1 (TAD1) that overlaps with the MDM2-binding surface competed by Nutlin (<a href=\"#bib32\">Picksley et al., 1994</a>). In fact, the DO-1 antibody competes the p53-MDM2 interaction in vitro in analogous fashion to Nutlin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cohen et al., 1998</a>). Under the denaturing conditions of a Western Blot assay, where p53-MDM2 complexes are fully disrupted, this antibody shows no significant increase in total p53 levels at the 1 hr time point of Nutlin treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). However, we posited that DO-1 reactivity should increase significantly upon Nutlin treatment under the fixed conditions employed in flow cytometry. Expectedly, flow cytometry quantitation shows that, even before Nutlin treatment, p53 +/+ cells have significantly more DO-1 reactivity than p53 \u2212/\u2212 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The functional importance of this \u2018basal p53 activity\u2019 will be investigated later in this report (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Interestingly, the p53 +/+ cell population shifts to significantly higher DO-1 reactivity at the 1 hr time point, as predicted by epitope unmasking. A further increase is observed at 12 hr of Nutlin treatment, when total p53 levels have risen considerably as measured by Western blots (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,F</a>). Finally, since GRO-seq is a population average experiment, we performed immunofluorescence assays to test if our GRO-seq results could be explained by massive p53 accumulation in just a few outlier cells within the population at the 1 hr time point. However, these experiments discarded the notion of outlier cells: although \u223c3% cells show high p53 staining at the 1 hr time point, this number is not significantly different than observed in control p53 +/+ cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G,H</a>)."

For example, we noted that the canonical p53 target gene <i>GADD45A</i> fell in this group<i>,</i> as its transcription was mildly induced at 1 hr and thus fell below our statistical cut-off.

The mechanism of p53-mediated gene repression remains debated in the field. Multiple independent ChIP-seq studies concur in that p53 binds weakly and very distally to those gene loci whose mRNAs are downregulated at the steady state level, and that the p53REs found at these sites match poorly to the consensus DNA sequence (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nikulenkov et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Menendez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Schlereth et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Using seven different available global ChIP datasets derived from HCT116 and two other cell lines, we created a collection of high confidence p53 binding events to analyze p53 binding in the vicinity of the various gene groups (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Nearly 40% of the 198 genes induced by GRO-seq harbor a p53 binding event within 25 kb, significantly more than expected from random occurrence (p<i>=</i>1e\u221248, Hypergeometric test) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Among the genes induced by microarray only, nearly 15% harbored p53 binding within 25 kb, still significantly more than expected by chance (p=8e\u221211), which suggests that some of these genes may be true direct targets activated at later time points. Most importantly, genes considered as repressed by the microarray profiling show little p53 binding within 25 kb, barely above what is expected by chance (p=3e\u22122), suggesting that the repression observed is largely indirect."

Of note, GRO-seq identified 5 miRNAs directly transactivated by p53 (miR-1204, miR-3189, miR-34a, miR4679-1 and miR-4692, see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Most prominent among these is miR-34a, a well characterized p53-inducible miRNA known to mediate indirect repression by p53 at late time points. In fact, we found that nearly 72% of genes repressed in our microarray by Nutlin were previously shown by others (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lal et al., 2011</a>) to be downregulated upon overexpression of miR-34a in HCT116 cells (p&lt;2.2e\u221216, Hypergeometric test, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). A recent report demonstrated that p21 and E2F4, a transcriptional repressor of S-phase genes acting coordinately with co-repressors of the RB family, are required for the downregulation of many genes previously characterized as \u2018direct\u2019 targets of p53 repression (<a href=\"#bib2\">Benson et al., 2013</a>). In agreement with these published findings, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the genes repressed in our microarray experiment revealed that the top three regulators affecting these genes are indeed E2F4 (p=1.02e\u221281, Fisher's Exact Test), CDKN1A (p=8.21e\u221262) and RB (p=8.12e\u221260) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Altogether, these data indicate that most gene repression observed in our system is likely to be indirect, either via miRNAs, such as miR-34a, and/or the p21&gt;RB&gt;E2F4 axis (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Of note, GRO-seq also identified the transcriptional repressor PRDM1 (BLIMP1) as a direct target of p53 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yan et al., 2007</a>), revealing yet another possible mechanism for indirect gene repression downstream of p53. However, IPA did not identify PRDM1 as a top regulator of genes repressed in the microarray study (not shown)."

                                "text": "Given that 72 genes were identified as activated only by GRO-seq, we further investigated the possible reasons for this result. Analysis of absolute signals generated by the GRO-seq (fpkm) vs microarray (mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) experiments generated several important insights (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). First of all, robust p53 target genes such as <i>CDKN1A</i> and <i>GDF15</i> show strong increases in both platforms. When these results are expressed as fold induction, a strong correlation between transcriptional output and steady state levels is evident for these genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). However, transcriptional output often does not correlate with steady state mRNA levels. For example, while the <i>BTG2</i> locus has a greater transcriptional output upon p53 activation than the <i>MDM2</i>, <i>PTP4A1</i>, <i>AMZ2</i> and <i>CCNG1</i> loci, its steady state mRNA levels are much lower, likely due to post-transcriptional repression of <i>BTG2</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This would explain why a small group of \u2018GRO-seq only' genes, including known p53 targets such as <i>PTP4A1</i> and <i>CCNG1,</i> are not called by the microarray experiments: they display very high basal steady state levels, which do not increase significantly despite clear transcriptional induction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, most \u2018GRO-seq only\u2019 genes belong to a different category, as marked by their very low levels of transcription and steady state mRNA expression. Genes like <i>CDC42BPG</i>, <i>ADAMTS7</i> and <i>LRP1</i> are clearly induced at the transcriptional level but show no apparent increase in the microarray signals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Remarkably, the induction of these mRNAs upon p53 activation is evident by Q-RT-PCR at the time point of the microarray experiment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In fact, when microarray-derived signals are displayed for the various gene sets, the \u2018GRO-seq only\u2019 group shows very significant lower expression as compared to all other groups (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Altogether, we conclude that microarray profiling is not sensitive enough to detect these low abundance transcripts, which could explain why several published ChIP-seq/microarray studies failed to identify these genes as direct p53 targets. Alternatively, it is possible that p53 binds to these genes from very distal sites outside of the arbitrary window defined during bioinformatics analysis of ChIP-seq data. To discern among these possibilities, we analyzed ChIP-seq data in search of high confidence p53 binding events in the vicinity of several novel genes identified by GRO-seq, and evaluated p53 binding using standard ChIP assays. Indeed, we detected clear p53 binding to all p53REs tested at these novel p53 targets (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Of note, p53 binds to proximal regions at the <i>CDC42BPG</i> and <i>LRP1</i> loci (+1373 bp and \u2212694 bp relative to transcription start site [TSS], respectively), indicating that these genes could have been missed in previous studies due to the low abundance of their transcripts. In contrast, p53 binds to very distal sites (i.e., &gt;30 kb from the TSS) at the <i>ADAMTS7</i>, <i>TOB1</i>, <i>ASS1</i> and <i>CEP85L</i> loci (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that these genes would have been missed as direct targets when setting an arbitrary &lt;30 kb window during ChIP-seq analysis. In summary, GRO-seq enables the identification of novel direct p53 target genes due both to its increased sensitivity and the fact that it does not require proximal p53 binding to ascertain direct regulation."

This was first recorded for <i>CDKN1A</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tang et al., 1998</a>), and it is confirmed by our GRO-seq analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, compare 2.6 to 5.7 fpkm in the Control tracks). To investigate whether this is a general phenomenon we analyzed the basal transcription of all p53-activated genes in control p53 +/+ vs p53 \u2212/\u2212 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Interestingly, p53 status exerts differential effects among its target genes prior to MDM2 inhibition with Nutlin. While many genes show the same behavior as <i>CDKN1A</i> (e.g., <i>GDF15</i>, <i>DDB2</i>, labeled green throughout <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), another group shows decreased transcription in the presence of MDM2-bound p53 (e.g., <i>PTP4A1</i>, <i>HES2</i>, <i>GJB5,</i> labeled red throughout <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Genome browser views illustrating this phenomena are provided for <i>GDF15</i> and <i>PTP4A1</i> in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>. The differential behavior of RNAPII at these gene loci is also observed in ChIP assays using antibodies against the Serine 5- and Serine 2-phosphorylated forms of the RBP1 C-terminal domain repeats, which mark initiating and elongating RNAPII complexes, respectively (S5P- and S2P-RNAPII, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Whereas the \u2018basally activated\u2019 <i>GDF15</i> locus displays higher GRO-seq and RNAPII ChIP signals in untreated p53 +/+ cells, the \u2018basally repressed\u2019 <i>PTP4A1</i> locus shows lower signals in the presence of MDM2-p53 complexes. Such differential effects among p53 target genes have a clear impact on their absolute level of transcription upon MDM2 inhibition: whereas those whose basal activity was increased ranked among the most differentially transcribed between Nutlin-treated p53 +/+ and p53 \u2212/\u2212 cells (top of the heatmap in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>); those basally repressed are virtually no different in expression between Nutlin-treated p53 +/+ and p53 \u2212/\u2212 cells (bottom of the heatmap in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Importantly, Q-RT-PCR shows that the differential effects of p53 on the basal transcription of its targets are generally translated into differences in mRNA steady level (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP experiments for p53 and MDM2 under conditions matching the GRO-seq experiment. For the p53 ChIP, we employed the monoclonal antibody DO-1 that recognizes the p53 TAD1 and whose reactivity should increase upon displacement of MDM2 by Nutlin. Importantly, ChIP assays show a significant amount of chromatin-bound p53 above background levels at the p53REs in the <i>CDKN1A</i> locus (basally activated), and the <i>PTP4A1</i> and <i>HES2</i> loci (basally repressed), even before Nutlin treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Of note, the DO-1 ChIP signals increase upon Nutlin treatment, as expected from epitope unmasking. ChIP assays also detect MDM2 chromatin binding above background levels at these three p53REs, with signals decreasing upon Nutlin treatment, as expected by the competitive action of this molecule (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Of note, although Nutlin disrupts the interaction between the p53 N-terminus and the hydrophobic pocket in the N-terminal domain of MDM2, a second molecular interaction occurs between the p53 C-terminus and the MDM2 N-terminus that is not competed by Nutlin in vitro (<a href=\"#bib34\">Poyurovsky et al., 2010</a>), which may explain why the MDM2 signal is not completely abrogated upon a short time point of Nutlin treatment.

More specifically, we hypothesized that genes that are basally transactivated by p53 would be more highly expressed in p53 WT cells than transrepressed genes. Oncomine analysis of 598 cancer cell lines not treated with p53-activating agents revealed that many genes that are \u2018basally activated\u2019 in HCT116 cells such as <i>CDKN1A</i>, <i>DDB2</i> and <i>GDF15</i> indeed show significantly higher mRNA expression in WT p53 cell lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). In contrast, the \u2018basally repressed\u2019 gene <i>GJB5</i> shows significantly higher expression in mutant p53 cell lines. When all 12,624 genes in the Oncomine analysis are ranked according to their relative expression in WT p53 over mutant p53 cell lines, many genes whose basal transcription is upregulated by p53 in HCT116 cells appear at the top of this ranking (e.g., <i>CDKN1A</i>, <i>DDB2</i> and <i>GDF15</i>, ranked 2, 4 and 62, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

Collectivelly, the direct p53 targets identified by GRO-seq are enriched toward the top of the ranking, which is revealed in a Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In contrast, genes induced only in the microarray platform (i.e., mostly indirect targets) do not show strong enrichment in a GSEA analysis. When the relative basal transcription between HCT116 p53 +/+ and p53 \u2212/\u2212 cells is plotted against the relative mRNA expression in p53 WT vs p53 mutant cell lines, it is apparent that many \u2018basally activated\u2019 genes are more highly expressed in p53 WT cells (green dots in the upper right quadrant in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

For example, \u223c20-fold more RNA is produced from the <i>CDKN1A</i> locus than from the <i>BBC3</i> locus encoding the BH3-only protein PUMA. The most potently transcribed apoptotic gene is <i>TP53I3</i> (<i>PIG3</i>), yet its transcriptional output is still 3.4-fold lower than <i>CDKN1A</i>. Based on measurements of steady state RNA levels, it was observed that apoptotic genes such as <i>TP53I3</i> and <i>FAS</i> are induced with a slower kinetics than <i>CDKN1A</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Szak et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Espinosa et al., 2003</a>). However, GRO-seq suggests that this is not due to a slower kinetics of RNAPII transactivation, but rather to a lower transcriptional output from the apoptotic loci. Although both <i>CDKN1A</i> and <i>TP53I3</i> display similar transcriptional induction within 1 hr of Nutlin treatment (7.4 and 6.07 fold induction, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), the <i>TP53I3</i> mRNA takes longer to display increased accumulation over basal levels (see Q-RT-PCR in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Szak et al., 2001</a>). Thus, differences in mRNA induction kinetics between gene classes could be explained from differential amounts of RNA synthesis. To investigate how much of the differential transcriptional output is due to p53 action vs p53-autonomous mechanisms, we analyzed the activity of these gene loci in p53 \u2212/\u2212 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Several important observations arise from this analysis. First, the basal activity of the <i>CDKN1A</i> locus is higher than most pro-apoptotic genes even in p53 \u2212/\u2212 cells, which agrees with previous studies revealing the action of strong core promoter elements at this locus (<a href=\"#bib10\">Espinosa and Emerson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Morachis et al., 2010</a>). However, the pro-apoptotic genes <i>TRAF4</i> and <i>AEN</i> are exceptions to this trend, as they display higher basal activity in p53 \u2212/\u2212 than <i>CDKN1A</i> and most pro-survival genes. Second, p53 action reinforces the distinction between the two classes by leading to \u2018super-activation\u2019 (i.e., greater than fivefold) of the survival genes <i>CDKN1A</i>, <i>GDF15</i>, <i>BTG2</i> and <i>MDM2</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Although select apoptotic genes such as <i>TP53I3</i>, <i>PHLDA3</i> and <i>FAS</i> also undergo super-activation, this does not suffice to override their overall lower transcriptional output. In sum, as a group, survival genes tend to be transcribed at a higher extent than apoptotic genes, which is due to a combination of p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms."

                                "text": "Next, we investigated whether RNAPII pausing exerted gene-specific effects within the p53 transcriptional program. Using ChIP assays, we previously reported that the <i>CDKN1A</i> promoter carries significantly higher levels of promoter-bound RNAPII than the apoptotic genes <i>TP53I3</i>, <i>TNFRSF10B</i>, <i>BBC3</i> and <i>FAS</i> prior to p53 activation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Espinosa et al., 2003</a>). GRO-seq confirms that the promoters of survival genes, including <i>CDKN1A</i>, indeed carry more transcriptionally engaged RNAPII than the promoters of apoptotic genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>); however, there was no obvious correlation between the amount of active RNAPII over the promoter and the degree of transcriptional output or induction. RNAPII pausing was proposed to modulate the timing of signal-induced gene expression, such as during the cellular response to LPS, where primary response genes were found to carry more paused RNAPII than secondary response genes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hargreaves et al., 2009</a>). However, others found that RNAPII pausing is not necessary for rapid gene induction (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hah et al., 2011</a>). To investigate this issue more thoroughly within the p53 network, we performed an analysis of pausing indices as previously described (<a href=\"#bib7\">Core et al., 2008</a>). This exercise revealed that although p53 target genes vary widely in their pausing indexes, there is no obvious correlation between pausing and the degree of transcriptional induction at the 1 hr time point of Nutlin treatment (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). For example, the <i>POLH</i> gene, which shows a very high pausing index, displays a lower fold induction and overall lower transcriptional output than the <i>PHLDA3</i> gene, which shows little signs of RNAPII pausing (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Thus, RNAPII pausing is not a pre-requisite for rapid induction within the p53 transcriptional program. The first GRO-seq analysis in human cells revealed widespread divergent transcription at most active promoters (<a href=\"#bib7\">Core et al., 2008</a>). We observed that the degree of divergence is highly variable across promoters of p53 target genes. For example, the <i>DRAM1</i> promoter displays more divergent transcription than sense transcription (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), yet divergent transcription is minor at gene loci such as <i>CDKN1A</i> or <i>DDB2</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, respectively). Using a \u2018divergence index\u2019, which evaluates the ratio of productive (sense) vs divergent transcription, we ranked p53 target genes from high to low promoter divergence, which revealed that there is no correlation between divergence and fold induction (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, divergence of RNAPII in the unproductive direction does not obviously affect p53 transactivation of its target genes."

Instead, GRO-seq analysis revealed many instances of potential for gene-specific regulation at key loci. For example, the <i>APAF1</i> gene<i>,</i> encoding a core component of the apoptosome, is activated from a non-overlapping bidirectional promoter with the <i>IKBIP</i> gene, where the two start sites are less than 280 bp apart (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The <i>FAS</i> gene, which encodes a death receptor involved in p53-dependent apoptosis<i>,</i> is transcribed from a bidirectional overlapping promoter with the <i>ACTA2</i> gene, where the start site of one gene resides within the first exon of the other gene, with the two transcription units overlapping for \u223c850 bp (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Several p53 target genes are organized in clusters, where a group of genes within a chromatin domain are concurrently upregulated. One example is the <i>TNFRS10</i> cluster encoding the pro-apoptotic TRAIL receptors DR4 (<i>TNFRSF10A)</i> and DR5/Killer (<i>TNFRSF10B</i>), as well as the counteracting decoy receptors DCR1 (<i>TNFRSF10C)</i> and DCR2 (<i>TNFRSF10D</i>) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Another interesting feature revealed by GRO-seq is the presence of significant intragenic antisense transcription at many p53 target genes. In many cases such antisense transcription can be attributed to eRNAs produced from intronic p53 enhancers (see later, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>); however, antisense transcription often originates from an overlapping transcriptional unit that is neither derived from a p53 binding event nor induced by p53. One example of this scenario is the pro-survival p53 target gene <i>GPR87</i>, which is embedded within an intron of <i>MED12L</i>, which is not a p53 target (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Thus, our GRO-seq dataset paves the way for many future mechanistic studies aimed at deciphering the impact of these gene-specific events in the regulation of p53 target genes and the cellular outcome upon p53 activation."

First, we asked what fraction of sites in each category is transcriptionally active in the four experimental conditions. This revealed that \u223c40% of distal sites and those not associated with p53 targets are transcriptionally active in p53 \u2212/\u2212 cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). The number increases to \u223c60% in p53 +/+ cells, likely revealing the action of basal p53 levels, as observed for the <i>DRAM1</i> locus. Expectedly, Nutlin leads to further increase in the fraction of active enhancers only in p53 +/+ cells. When the analysis is restricted to those p53REs within 25 kb of a direct p53 target, the fraction that are transcribed in p53 \u2212/\u2212 cells increases to \u223c70%, and nearly all of them are transcriptionally active in Nutlin-treated p53 +/+ cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Thus, eRNAs are a hallmark of active p53 binding sites. We next investigated whether there are differences across p53 binding events found in the various locations in terms of eRNA activation and overall expression. A fold induction analysis shows that p53 stimulates eRNA transcription to a similar degree regardless of location (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). This result counters the notion that p53 acts as transcriptional repressor from distal sites by a mechanism described as \u2018enhancer interference\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, the absolute amount of eRNA produced varies greatly with location (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). First, eRNA transcription is much weaker from distal sites relative to proximal sites (p=1.28e\u221212 for Nutlin-treated p53 +/+ cells). This could be explained by more efficient communication between enhancers and promoters when in closer proximity. Second, eRNA transcription is significantly higher from proximal sites associated with direct p53 target genes. Strikingly, this difference is already evident in p53 \u2212/\u2212 cells (p=1e\u221210). Thus, a distinctive feature between direct p53 target genes and those genes proximal to bound p53REs but not activated is the strength of eRNA production in the absence of p53. In other words, p53 seems to activate gene expression at genomic locations carrying \u2018primed\u2019, pre-activated enhancers, likely revealing the action of pioneer factors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

In particular, it is unclear which p53 target genes contribute to tumor suppression in various contexts. A thorough analysis of the literature up to 2008 revealed \u223c120 direct p53 target genes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Riley et al., 2008</a>). Since then, genomics experiments using microarrays and ChIP-seq suggest thousands of p53 targets, but very few genes were commonly identified by multiple studies (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nikulenkov et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Menendez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Schlereth et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). The lack of overlap between these reports could be due to the fact that they employed different cell types and somewhat different experimental platforms. However, measurements of RNA steady state levels may produce a misleading view of direct p53 action, as they confound direct vs indirect effects. Thus, it is possible that cell type-specific secondary effects and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms strongly qualify the direct transcriptional response in different cell types. Ascertaining direct p53 action by the mere presence of a p53 binding event within an arbitrary distance to a putative target gene is an imprecise exercise, as p53 may act directly from very distal sites outside of this arbitrary cutoff (leading to false negatives) and because many proximal p53 binding events may be unproductive (leading to false positives). Because of these caveats, we investigated direct transcriptional regulation by p53 using GRO-seq."

Because MDM2 functions as an E3 ligase targeting p53 for degradation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kubbutat et al., 1997</a>), there was no guarantee that the low basal levels of p53 present in a proliferating cell culture would suffice to induce transcription of its target genes. Importantly, ChIP assays demonstrate that p53 and MDM2 occupy p53REs in proliferating cells and that MDM2 binding is decreased upon Nutlin treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These observations emphasize the role of MDM2 as a transcriptional repressor by masking of the p53 transactivation domains (<a href=\"#bib31\">Oliner et al., 1993</a>), but do not negate the importance of p53 degradation as a repressive mechanism, as it is possible that increased p53 levels are required for activation of target genes at later time points. Our results contrast the notion that apoptotic genes require higher levels of p53 for transactivation or that they are transcriptionally induced at later time points, highlighting instead the \u2018primed\u2019 nature of a multifunctional p53 transcriptional response. Furthermore, this confirms that the failure of many cell types to undergo apoptosis upon Nutlin treatment is not due to a defect in transactivation of key apoptotic genes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Henry et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sullivan et al., 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "Although p53 action leads to massive gene repression at a global scale over time, it is unclear how much of these effects are direct vs indirect. Previous genomics experiments identified dozens of genes that are both bound by p53 within a certain arbitrary distance and whose steady state RNA levels decrease at late time points (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nikulenkov et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Menendez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Schlereth et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). However, meta-analysis of these reports failed to identify a single gene commonly repressed in more than one study (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Recent work showed that p21 is both necessary and sufficient to downregulate many genes commonly described as direct targets of p53 repression, mostly acting via E2F4 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Benson et al., 2013</a>). Other cell cycle inhibitory pathways may also converge on E2F4 repressive complexes, such as the p53-inducible miRNA miR-34a, which targets the mRNAs encoding G1-S cyclins (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lal et al., 2011</a>). Our data supports the notion that most repression downstream of p53 activation is indirect. First, MDM2 inhibition by 1 hr Nutlin treatment identified only four repressed genes, none of which showed repression at the steady state levels. In contrast, a microarray experiment at 12 hr showed hundreds of downregulated genes. Analysis of this gene set strongly supports the notion that E2F4, p21, RB and miR-34a largely mediate their repression (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E</a>)."

                        "text": "Interestingly, GRO-seq analysis of p53 null cells revealed that p53-MDM2 complexes might directly repress transcription at a subset of p53 targets. These genes are downregulated in the presence of MDM2-bound p53 but then activated by Nutlin. These results reveal that basal amounts of p53 found in proliferating cells create an uneven landscape among its transactivation targets, pre-activating some and repressing others. Mechanistically, p53-MDM2 complexes may directly repress transcription due to the inhibitory effects of MDM2 on components of the Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC). Early work by Tjian et al. using in vitro transcription assays demonstrated a dual mechanism of transcription inhibition by MDM2 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Thut et al., 1997</a>). Their biochemical assays demonstrated that MDM2 not only masks the p53 transactivation domain, but that it also represses transcription when tethered to DNA by a GAL4 DNA binding domain. They identified an inhibitory domain in MDM2 that binds to the PIC components TBP and TFIIE, and hypothesized that MDM2 could repress transcription by targeting the basal transcription machinery. Our GRO-seq results identify specific p53 targets where this mechanism could be taking place and ChIP experiments using p53 and MDM2 antibodies confirm binding of both proteins to the p53REs at these loci. In agreement with these results, others have previously demonstrated that in proliferating cells MDM2 binds to p53REs in a p53-dependent manner, and that MDM2 recruitment to chromatin can be disrupted by Nutlin or DNA damaging agents (<a href=\"#bib48\">White et al., 2006</a>). Also, excess MDM2 was shown to exert uneven repressive effects on the expression of p53 target genes, independently of effects on p53 levels or chromatin binding (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ohkubo et al., 2006</a>). Altogether, these data support the arising notion that MDM2 works as a gene-specific co-regulator of p53 target genes by mechanisms other than mere p53 inhibition (<a href=\"#bib3\">Biderman et al., 2012</a>)."

Our GRO-seq analysis reinforced the notion that <i>CDKN1A,</i> a key mediator of arrest, differs from key apoptotic genes in several aspects. <i>CDKN1A</i> has outstanding transcriptional output among p53 target genes, which is partly due to the fact that its promoter drives substantial p53-independent transcription, but also due to potent p53-dependent transactivation. In vitro transcription assays demonstrated the <i>CDKN1A</i> core promoter initiates transcription more rapidly and effectively than the <i>FAS</i> core promoter (<a href=\"#bib28\">Morachis et al., 2010</a>), and GRO-seq confirms that <i>FAS</i> has weaker transcriptional output than <i>CDKN1A</i>. However, our GRO-seq analysis failed to identify a uniform criterion discriminating between the most well studied survival and apoptotic genes. To the contrary, GRO-seq revealed that each individual p53 target gene is subject to various layers of gene-specific regulatory mechanisms, including but not restricted to differential levels of p53-independent transcription, p53 transactivation potential, RNAPII pausing, promoter divergence, extragenic vs intragenic eRNAs, overlapping promoters, clustered activation and antisense transcription."

We interpret this result as the action of unknown pioneering factors acting at these putative enhancers prior to p53 signaling, which would establish enhancer-promoter communication and ready these genes for further transactivation by p53 or other stimulus-induced transcription factors. This notion is supported by a recent analysis of eRNAs at three distal p53 binding sites, which were shown to be involved in long range chromatin loops independently of p53 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Melo et al., 2013</a>). This model also agrees with a recent report showing that TNF-responsive enhancers are in physical contact with their target promoters prior to TNF signaling (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jin et al., 2013</a>). Thus, it is likely that the p53 transcriptional program is qualified by the action of lineage-specific factors that prepare a subset of p53 enhancers in a cell type-specific manner."

The assays covered three cell lines (HCT116, U20S, MCF7) and 6 different conditions (untreated, Nutlin, 5FU, RITA, ActD, Etoposide). First, all samples were lifted over to hg19 coordinates. Second, a file was created that contained all sites from each experiment and the sites were then sorted and merged using BedTools (2.16.1). This created a list of 106,600 total sites, only 1481 of which were found in 5/7 datasets."

All gene lists are provided in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>. Genes bound by p53 and upregulated (339) or downregulated (8) upon Nutlin treatment in MCF7 cells were obtained from Tables S7 and S10 of the Nikulenkov et al paper. Genes bound by p53 and upregulated or downregulated by either Nutlin or Doxorubicin treatment in U2OS cells were obtained from Supplemental Dataset 3, (file: nar-00620-v-2013-File011), of the Menendez et al paper. We removed from the analysis of \u2018p53 activated genes\u2019 those that were repressed by Nutlin or Doxorubicin, keeping only those that were either activated by both drugs or activated by one drug and unchanged with the other. Genes bound by p53 and upregulated or downregulated upon p53 overexpression in SAOS2 cells were obtained from Table S1 of the Schlereth et al paper. We removed from this list duplicate gene entries. Genes bound by p53 and upregulated or downregulated upon p53 overexpression in HCT116 p53 \u2212/\u2212 cells were obtained from Table S3 and Table S5 of the Wang et al paper.

Then sites were removed if overlapped with an annotated refseq gene on the same strand (160,604 stranded-sites left after removal). The number of reads covering each remaining site were counted using coveragebed and fpkm calculate for each site. To create a list of high confidence p53 binding sites we could use for analyses of eRNAs we used only sites that were bound in five of the seven ChIP experiments used above (2283 stranded-sites, 1454 sites). We then divided these sites into three categories. Distal sites (more than 25 kb from any annotated refseq gene) (992 stranded-sites, 496 sites); proximal to non-target gene sites (less than or equal to 25 kb from a gene i.e. not a GRO-seq target, 1187 stranded-sites, 555 sites with only one strand, 316 sites with both strands); and sites near p53 target genes (less than or equal to 25 kb from a gene i.e. a GRO-seq target, 104 stranded-sites, 70 sites with only one strand, 17 sites with both strands). We then determined a percent of the sites that are active by the same method used in <a href=\"#bib7\">Core et al. (2008)</a>. Briefly, background was set at 3% of the reads. We estimate the probability of observing at least N reads in an interval of length L using a Poisson distribution. If the probability was above 0.01 the site was called transcriptionally active. For each site, if either of the two strands was transcriptionally active (logical or) the site was counted as active therefore for the <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>, n = 496, 496, 496, 496, 871, 871, 871, 871, 87, 87, 87, 87. For <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> we wanted to include information from both strands when available so stranded-sites were used to determine the fpkm of each site, therefore n = 992, 992, 992, 992, 1187, 1187, 1187, 1187, 104, 104, 104, 104. Similarly, for <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F</a> we included all stranded-sites but for each comparison we had to remove any sites in a given sample that had 0 reads, therefore n = 323, 602, 566, 897, 83, 100."

Real-time PCR was carried out on ChIP-enriched DNA against a standard curve of genomic DNA, with amplicons tiling across the locus. Enrichment values for each amplicon were calculated as percentage of the amplicon with maximum signal for each antibody or expressed as equivalents of gDNA in nanograms. For MDM2 ChIPs a modified RIPA pH 7.4 buffer was used (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.025% SDS, 50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, protease/phosphatase inhibitors)."

Even though these genes are considered 'direct' targets from GRO-seq analysis after nutlin treatment, it is unclear whether they have evidence of p53 binding this small subset of genes, and since this is not an immediate knockdown experiment, should the authors consider secondary effects as they did in the first part of the paper? To support a direct role for p53 in repressing these promoters, the authors could ask whether p53 and/or MDM2 are at these basally regulated promoters by performing ChIP-qPCR or by using published ChIP-seq data."

First of all, the immunofluorescence discards the notion of \u2018jackpot\u2019 cells: although \u223c3% cells show high p53 staining at the 1 hour time point of Nutlin treatment, this number is not significantly different from that observed in control p53 +/+ cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1G\u2013H</a>)."

                    "text": "The greater question behind this comment is: how could we observe such drastic transactivation of p53 target genes at 1 hour of Nutlin treatment without any noticeable increase in total p53 levels? Although it is well established that MDM2 represses p53 both by masking its transactivation domain and by targeting it for degradation, the contribution of each mechanism to the regulation of p53 target genes has been very difficult to tease out experimentally. This is not a trivial issue, because previous studies employing steady state mRNA measurements concluded that prolonged p53 activation and higher p53 levels were differentially required for activation of apoptotic genes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Das et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Espinosa et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Szak et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhao et al., 2000</a>). However, GRO-seq demonstrates that a 1 hour time point of Nutlin treatment induces transcription of genes in every major pathway downstream of p53 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1 G</a>). The observation that key survival (e.g. p21) and apoptotic genes (e.g. PIG3) show &gt;6-fold increase in transcription at a time point preceding a proportional increase in total p53 levels as measured by Western blot, indicates that the mere unmasking of the p53 transactivation domain suffices to activate a multifaceted transcriptional program."

In fact, DO-1 is able to compete the p53-MDM2 interaction in vitro (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cohen et al., 1998</a>), in analogous fashion to Nutlin. Under the denaturing conditions of a Western Blot assay, where the p53-MDM2 complexes are fully disrupted, this antibody reveals no significant increase in total p53 levels at 1 hour Nutlin treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). However, we posited that DO-1 reactivity should increase significantly upon Nutlin treatment under the fixed conditions employed in flow cytometry. Flow cytometry quantitation shows that, even before Nutlin treatment, p53 +/+ cells have significantly more DO-1 reactivity than p53 -/- cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The functional importance of this \u2018basal p53 activity\u2019 is investigated at length later in our report (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Interestingly, the p53 +/+ cell population shifts to significantly higher DO-1 reactivity at the 1 hour time point, as expected from epitope unmasking. A further increase is observed at 12 hours of Nutlin treatment, when total p53 levels have risen considerably as measured by Western blots (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,G</a>)."

[\u2026] Of note, although Nutlin disrupts the interaction between the p53 N-terminus and the hydrophobic pocket in the N-terminal domain of MDM2, a second molecular interaction occurs between the p53 C-terminus and the MDM2 N-terminus that is not competed by Nutlin in vitro (<a href=\"#bib34\">Poyurovsky et al., 2010</a>), which may explain why the MDM2 signal is not completely abrogated upon a short time point of Nutlin treatment.

In the manuscript we also show that another large fraction of the repression can be explained by upregulation of miR-34a, a p53-inducible miRNA detected by GRO-seq as a primary target. Analysis of our \u2018repressed\u2019 gene set led to the observation that up to 72% of them are downregulated in this same cell type upon miR-34a overexpression. Therefore, two direct targets or p53 transactivation (CDKN1A and miR-34a) can drive most of the indirect gene repression seen at a late time point by microarrays."
