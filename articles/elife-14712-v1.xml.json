Here we show that cell-cell contact-dependent type VI secretion (T6S) toxin-immunity systems are among those activated by quorum sensing in <i>B. thailandensis</i>. We also demonstrate that T6S is required to constrain proliferation of quorum sensing mutants in colony cocultures of a BtaR1 quorum-sensing signal receptor mutant and its parent. However, the BtaR1 mutant is not constrained by and outcompetes its parent in broth coculture, presumably because no cell contact occurs and there is a metabolic cost associated with quorum sensing gene activation. The increased fitness of the wild type over the BtaR1 mutant during agar surface growth is dependent on an intact T6SS-1 apparatus. Thus, quorum sensing activates <i>B. thailandensis</i> T6SS-1 growth inhibition and this control serves to police and constrain quorum-sensing mutants. This work defines a novel role for T6SSs in intraspecies mutant control."

We also demonstrate that T6S is required to constrain proliferation of quorum sensing mutants in colony cocultures of a BtaR1 quorum-sensing signal receptor mutant and its parent. However, the BtaR1 mutant is not constrained by and outcompetes its parent in broth coculture, presumably because no cell contact occurs and there is a metabolic cost associated with quorum sensing gene activation. The increased fitness of the wild type over the BtaR1 mutant during agar surface growth is dependent on an intact T6SS-1 apparatus. Thus, quorum sensing activates <i>B. thailandensis</i> T6SS-1 growth inhibition and this control serves to police and constrain quorum-sensing mutants. This work defines a novel role for T6SSs in intraspecies mutant control."

These experiments showed that chemical signals released by the cooperative bacteria cause them to produce both toxins and proteins that protect against these toxins. This allows the cooperative cells to poison cheaters that they come in contact with, while suffering no ill effects themselves. This allows the cooperative bacteria, via the signaling chemicals, to police cheats and reward only other cooperative bacteria. The next step will be to determine if other types of bacteria also use this policing strategy and to identify more pairs of genes that contribute to protecting the benefits of cooperation."

A well-studied type of QS common to a number of Proteobacteria species is mediated by acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals. AHLs are made by members of the LuxI family of signal synthases. The AHLs can diffuse in and out of cells. At sufficient cell densities, the AHLs accumulate to concentrations needed for expression of specific genes by binding signal receptors of the LuxR family of transcriptional regulators (for reviews of QS see (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fuqua et al., 1996</a>)). In some bacterial species, QS controls just a few genes and in others it controls hundreds of genes. Genes for production of secreted or excreted products are overrepresented in AHL quorum sensing regulons. These extracellular products have at least in some cases been shown to serve as public goods. Any member of a group can benefit from the public good regardless of whether that individual has contributed its share of the good (<a href=\"#bib30\">West et al., 2006</a>). There is a metabolic cost associated with QS and QS-activation of gene expression. QS control of public goods has been studied in some detail in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Because QS activates production of extracellular proteases, QS signal receptor mutants have a fitness advantage over the wild type when growth is on milk protein as the sole carbon and energy source (<a href=\"#bib8\">Diggle et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Sandoz et al., 2007</a>). The receptor mutant fitness advantage presents a conundrum; how is QS-mediated cooperation preserved?"

In <i>P. aeruginosa,</i> three mechanisms of QS cheater restraint have been demonstrated. The first is a direct benefit-based strategy called metabolic constraint (<a href=\"#bib21\">Schuster et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dandekar et al., 2012</a>); Quorum sensing activates genes coding for public goods (such as extracellular proteases), as well as a limited set of privately utilized goods (such as a hydrolase that allows producing cells to utilize adenosine). When cells are supplied with both casein and adenosine, QS signal receptor (LasR) mutant cheats are penalized and constrained (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dandekar et al., 2012</a>). A second mechanism has been called metabolic prudence (<a href=\"#bib31\">Xavier et al., 2011</a>) where the QS-controlled public good is only made when it\u2019s production is not costly. Metabolic prudence minimizes the cost of cooperation. Recently, a mechanism whereby <i>P. aeruginosa</i> cooperators punish or police cheats has been described. QS competent cooperators produce cyanide and are more resistant to cyanide than QS mutant cheats, and thus the cooperators can constrain cheats by slowing their growth with cyanide (<a href=\"#bib29\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). The <i>P. aeruginosa</i> policing is a rare example of this sort of activity in bacteria, and because cyanide production and resistance has some semblance to a toxin-immunity-like mechanism we hypothesis that QS activation of toxin-immunity systems might have some generality as a policing mechanism where QS bacteria can control QS mutants."

Together, the QS systems control hundreds of genes. The BtaR1-I1 regulon appears to be the largest as BtaR1 regulates &gt;150 genes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Majerczyk et al., 2014</a>). We queried the transcriptomics data and discovered that expression of several genes shown to encode Type VI secretion system (T6SS) substrates, including characterized toxins and their cognate immunity or antitoxin genes, are activated by QS. Expression of a toxin and its antitoxin results in a toxin-resistant producer cell, which can deliver toxins via the secretion apparatus via cell-cell contact to a sensitive cell thereby inhibiting growth of the sensitive cell (<a href=\"#bib19\">Russell et al., 2014</a>). We show that T6S provides wild-type <i>B. thailandensis</i> with an ability to constrain BtaR1 mutants in a contact-dependent manner. This supports the hypothesis that QS activation of toxin-immunity systems can serve as a policing mechanism to control QS mutants growing among QS competent wild-type cells. Our findings also reveal yet another role for T6S in bacteria. T6S has been shown to provide a competitive interspecies or interstrain advantage, and some T6Ss have been shown to play a role in bacterial virulence (<a href=\"#bib22\">Schwarz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">2014</a>). Here we describe intraspecific control of QS mutants. This provides a rationale for why T6S toxin and immunity genes might be under QS control."

Cell contact is minimal during growth in broth but does occur when cells are grown on a solid agar surface. This led us to ask if QS controls contact-dependent growth inhibition systems. We previously reported that QS-1 activated the contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) system encoded by the <i>cdiAIB</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Majerczyk et al., 2014</a>). However, CDI does not limit the outgrowth of the BtaR1<sup>-</sup> mutant during agar-grown cocultures. We next asked whether QS regulates other contact-dependent growth inhibitory factors. <i>B. thailandensis</i> contains five different T6SSs, at least one of which is used for interspecies competition (T6SS-1) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Schwarz et al., 2010</a>). The T6SS-1 comprises a pathway that delivers effector proteins to neighboring cells upon direct cell contact. Some T6SS-1 effectors have been characterized and are toxic (<a href=\"#bib19\">Russell et al., 2014</a>). <i>B. thailandensis</i> is immune to the toxins because it produces cognate immunity proteins (<a href=\"#bib19\">Russell et al., 2014</a>). We asked if the T6SS-1 was under QS-control by querying <i>B. thailandensis</i> QS transcriptomics data (<a href=\"#bib15\">Majerczyk et al., 2014</a>) for genes for the T6SS-1 apparatus or for previously identified substrates (<a href=\"#bib17\">Russell et al., 2012</a>). Although genes for the T6SS-1 apparatus are not QS-controlled, we observed that QS activates nine genes for T6SS-1 substrates, as well as an additional eight that are either adjacent to a substrate gene, fall within the same gene cluster, or include a putative T6SS-1 immunity gene (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

T6Ss occur in many species of Proteobacteria where they can provide an advantage over competing species (see <a href=\"#bib19\">Russell et al., 2014</a> for review). We note that in other organisms including, <i>Pectobacterium atrosepticum</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Liu et al., 2008</a>), <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Lesic et al., 2009</a>), <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Khajanchi et al., 2009),</a>\u00a0<i>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>), <i>Chromobacterium violaceum</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Stauff and Bassler, 2011</a>), <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Zheng et al., 2010</a>), <i>Vibrio alginolyticus</i>, (<a href=\"#bib24\">Sheng et al., 2012</a>), and <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Wang et al., 2013</a>), QS regulates genes for the T6S apparatus (not the effector and immunity factors as we describe for <i>B. thailandensis</i>). We suspect QS regulation of the T6S apparatus might play a role in policing QS mutants during polymicrobial competitions or in other scenarios where T6S might benefit the producing cell. Furthermore, we note that other types of toxin-antitoxin systems have been reported to be under control of other non-AHL-mediated quorum sensing systems, for example the <i>E. coli mazEF</i> encoded toxin-antitoxin genes are controlled by a linear pentapeptide quorum sensing signal (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kolodkin-Gal et al., 2007</a>)."

The BtaR2-BtaI2 and BtaR3-BtaI3 QS systems do not appear to carry this large cost. We describe a mechanism by which wild-type populations can mitigate the cost of BtaR1-BtaI1 gene regulation by hindering the growth of QS mutants via regulation of cell-contact-dependent toxin and immunity proteins. This is a form of microbial policing; QS-proficient bacteria are outcompeted in populations of signal blind non-cooperators in the absence of the T6S cell-contact growth inhibition system. It is interesting that BtaR1 also promotes aggregation of cells under some conditions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chandler et al., 2009</a>). One can imagine that this system brings cells into close proximity where they can resist infiltration by other strains and species while at the same time protect themselves against social deviant BtaR1 mutant bacteria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

ES16 (ES15 <i>glmS2 attn7::Km</i>; Tp<sup>R</sup>, Km<sup>R</sup>) was then made by transforming ES15 with pTNS2 and pUC18T-mini-Tn7T-<i>km.</i> We used PCR to confirm that the antibiotic resistance markers and complementation construct were inserted at the <i>attn7</i> site near <i>glmS1</i> or <i>glmS2</i> in all of the constructs.."

We sampled cultures every hour and determined cell numbers by plate counting. For competition experiments we used inocula from overnight cultures at a ratio of 99:1 as indicated. As above, the starting optical densities were 0.05 in a volume of 15\u2009mL in a 125-mL flask. Abundances of each strain were determined by plate counting on selective media."

The solid surface-grown cocultures were incubated at 30\u00b0C and the liquid-grown cocultures were incubated with shaking at 37\u00b0C to minimize aggregation. At 24\u2009hr intervals cells were harvested, counted and used to inoculate a new broth or plate. Colonies on plates were scraped from the agar surface, suspended in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and subjected to water bath sonication for 10\u2009min to disrupt aggregates. The cells in phosphate buffer were diluted to an optical density of 0.2. Twenty \u03bcl of the density-adjusted cell suspension was spotted onto an agar plate for another round of competition. Bacteria grown in broth were similarly diluted and 20\u2009\u03bcL of the density adjusted cell suspension was inoculated into a test tube with 4\u2009mL broth. At each transfer cells of each of the competing strains were enumerated by selective plate counting."

This ambiguity could be addressed by ectopic expression of immunity gene(s) linked to these toxins (Tle1/Tli1 and paralogs) together with competition experiments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1 &amp; 2B</a>). If it turns out that this experiment is not straightforward, the authors should comment on what they have tried.</i> We agree with the reviewer. The data demonstrate \u201cT6S plays a role in Bt \u201cpolicing\u201d of QS-defective mutants, but it remains unknown which QS-controlled T6 effector and immunity factors are responsible for this policing activity.\u201d Based on our current understanding of T6S and delivery of toxins to other bacteria we assume there are several secreted effectors involved in policing. This is the complication that led us away from the suggested experiments."

Of these 17 QS-controlled factors, only the activities of <i>tle1</i>and <i>tli1</i> have been characterized. For the others that are uncharacterized, we do not know which are truly toxins and which have cognate immunity factors."

We decided against this approach because there are so many other (uncharacterized) toxin/immunity factors in the TSS-1 system. We would need to ectopically and constitutively express all QS-controlled T6S immunity factors and in doing so we would compromise the experiment by putting a heavy burden on the expressing strain. At the very least this sort of experiment would be technically challenging and require an enormous effort."

We believe the CFU/mL data are important as they show the phase of bacterial growth. This is relevant as QS-controlled processes are regulated in a cell density-dependent manner and most are induced as cells enter post-exponential phase.
