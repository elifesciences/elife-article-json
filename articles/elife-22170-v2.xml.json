Here we address the effects of the developmental transcription factor orthopedia (Otp) on hypothalamic development and function. We show that developmental mutations in the zebrafish paralogous gene <i>otpa</i> but not <i>otpb</i> affect both stress response and social preference. These behavioral phenotypes were associated with developmental alterations in oxytocinergic (OXT) neurons. Thus, <i>otpa</i> and <i>otpb</i> differentially regulate neuropeptide switching in a newly identified subset of OXT neurons that co-express the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Single-cell analysis revealed that these neurons project mostly to the hindbrain and spinal cord. Ablation of this neuronal subset specifically reduced adult social preference without affecting stress behavior, thereby uncoupling the contribution of a specific OXT cluster to social behavior from the general <i>otpa<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> deficits. Our findings reveal a new role for Otp in controlling developmental neuropeptide balance in a discrete OXT circuit whose disrupted development affects social behavior."

Here we address the effects of the developmental transcription factor orthopedia (Otp) on hypothalamic development and function. We show that developmental mutations in the zebrafish paralogous gene <i>otpa</i> but not <i>otpb</i> affect both stress response and social preference. These behavioral phenotypes were associated with developmental alterations in oxytocinergic (OXT) neurons. Thus, <i>otpa</i> and <i>otpb</i> differentially regulate neuropeptide switching in a newly identified subset of OXT neurons that co-express the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Single-cell analysis revealed that these neurons project mostly to the hindbrain and spinal cord. Ablation of this neuronal subset specifically reduced adult social preference without affecting stress behavior, thereby uncoupling the contribution of a specific OXT cluster to social behavior from the general <i>otpa<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> deficits. Our findings reveal a new role for Otp in controlling developmental neuropeptide balance in a discrete OXT circuit whose disrupted development affects social behavior."

Hypothalamus regulated processes include proper responses to anxiogenic and to social stimuli, which affect the animal\u2019s fitness. The development of the circuitry underlying hypothalamic functions is a highly complex process, which relies on orchestrated expression of transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib50\">Puelles and Rubenstein, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dom\u00ednguez et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Machluf et al., 2011</a>). In humans, defects in hypothalamic development may lead to pathology (<a href=\"#bib11\">Caqueret et al., 2005</a>). In particular, developmental disruptions of the oxytocin (OXT) system have been implicated in many pathological conditions, including autism and Prader-Willi syndrome, which are associated with impaired responses to stressful, social and metabolic stimuli (<a href=\"#bib3\">Atasoy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Swaab et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lerer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Thompson et al., 2011</a>)."

In this regards, relatively minor changes in gene expression during development may affect hypothalamic oxytocinergic (OXT-ergic) outputs. Such developmental variations in expression levels of OXT and/or its cognate receptor are not necessarily lethal; however, they may disrupt both physiological and psychological responses such as stress and social behaviors (<a href=\"#bib37\">King et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bosch et al., 2005</a>). Similarly, genetic variations in the V1a receptor for arginine-vasopressin (AVP), which often functionally synergizes with or antagonizes OXT signaling, are associated with changes in personality features in chimpanzees as well as pair bonding behavior in humans (<a href=\"#bib73\">Walum et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hopkins et al., 2012</a>)."

Works of several labs including ours have focused on the homeodomain transcription factor orthopedia (Otp), which is essential for proper hypothalamic differentiation. Otp is important for the development of hypothalamic neurons, including OXT neurons in mouse (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acampora et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wang and Lufkin, 2000</a>) and fish (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eaton et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blechman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ryu et al., 2007</a>). In addition to its effect on hypothalamic development, zebrafish Otp mutants display impaired behavioral response to homeostatic challenges such as adaptation to novel environment as well as dark-induced photokinesis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amir-Zilberstein et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fernandes et al., 2012</a>). Given the role of Otp in the development of OXT neurons and the established role of OXT in the regulation of social behavior across vertebrates, it is expected that Otp may not only be involved in the stress response but also to have a developmental effect on social behavior."

We show that <i>otpa,</i> but not <i>otpb</i>, mutants display anxiety-like and social-related defects. Subsequently we demonstrated that the two <i>otp</i> genes differentially regulate the expression of OXT (a.k.a. isotocin in fish) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in a newly identified OXT neuronal cluster. Finally, we show that these OXT cells, which project mainly to the hindbrain and spinal cord, are associated with the modulation of social behavior, but not with the response to stressful stimuli."

Zebrafish express two paralogous genes, namely <i>otpa</i> and <i>otpb</i>, whose expression patterns largely overlap. Thus, adult fish with a single mutation in either gene are viable and fertile (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ryu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fernandes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amir-Zilberstein et al., 2012</a>). To examine the consequences of developmental mutations of both <i>otpa</i> and <i>otpb</i> on adult physiology, we tested the behavioral responses of these mutant fish to stressful and social challenges. These challenges are known to trigger evolutionarily conserved behaviors that depend on normal hypothalamic development (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biran et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Szarek et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carter, 2003</a>)."

The open field paradigm is a standard anxiety-like behavioral test in rodents that has been adapted to zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib13\">Champagne et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nunes et al., 2016</a>). In this test adult zebrafish are transferred to a novel circular arena where time spent near the walls (thigmotaxis) is taken as an anxiety-like behavior, since anxiolytic drugs can shift this preference (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cachat et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kalueff et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Schn\u00f6rr et al., 2012</a>). We examined the location and velocity of the fish during the whole trial (10 min). Upon introduction into the novel environment, wild type fish displayed a preference to remain in the center of the arena swimming at a relatively low speed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Over time, these fish gradually swam towards the walls and increased their swimming velocity until they reached a steady-state average distance of 1\u20132 cm from the walls, with an average speed of\u00a0~10 cm/sec. <i>otpb<sup>\u2212/\u2212\u00a0</sup></i>mutants displayed similar swimming patterns to those of wild type fish (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). In contrast to both, the <i>otpa<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mutant displayed significantly unusual swimming patterns (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Throughout the test, <i>otpa<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> fish tended to freeze more, spent most of the time near the center of the arena, and their average speed did not increase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Notably, no difference was observed in the locomotor activity of <i>otpa</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mutants versus wild types or <i>otpb<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> when tested in their home tank environment. This indicates that the open field phenotype is not due to motor deficits and suggests a context-dependent behavior of the mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). These results indicate that <i>otpa<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> but not <i>otpb<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mutants display aberrant response to an open field consistent with the previously established role of Otpa in stress adaptation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amir-Zilberstein et al., 2012</a>)."

This test has been widely used to measure zebrafish sociality, by quantifying the zebrafish preference to associate with a shoal, i.e. to swim next to a group of conspecifics (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fernandes et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Engeszer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nunes et al., 2016</a>). For that, we have devised a behavioral arena of three compartments separated by transparent barriers, in which the focal fish can choose to either roam the large part of the arena or swim near the two other compartments. One compartment contained a group of four fish (i.e. shoal), and the region of interest next to it was termed the \u2018social zone\u2019. The second compartment was empty and the adjacent region of interest was termed the \u2018non-social\u2019 zone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Upon introduction to the main compartment, both wild type and <i>otpb<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mutant fish rapidly entered the \u2018social zone\u2019 and spent a substantial portion of their time next to the shoal compartment rather than in the \u2018non-social zone\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>). In comparison, <i>otpa<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mutants spent significantly less time in the \u2018social zone\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Given the result of the open field <i>otpa</i> mutants might be less likely to enter the social zone due to increased anxiety. To address this, we analyzed the number of entries into the social zone as well as the habituation to the preference arena as measured by the distance moved and speed over time. We found no significant difference in all three parameters between wild type and <i>otpa</i> mutant animals (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We conclude that <i>otpa</i> mutants display normal habituation to the VMSP arena as well as exploration of the social zone."

We had previously generated a transgenic oxt:EGFP reporter [<i>Tg(oxt:egfp)</i>], which faithfully represents the endogenous expression of <i>oxt</i> mRNA and protein (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blechman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gutnick et al., 2011</a>). We noticed the existence of a small cluster of EGFP-expressing cells in the PT of the <i>Tg(oxt:egfp)</i> reporter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), whose anatomical location and arrangement resembled the presumably ectopic OXT cells observed in the <i>otpa<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mutant. We therefore crossed <i>Tg(oxt:egfp)</i> with <i>otpa<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> zebrafish and examined whether the ectopic OXT-positive neurons co-localized with transgenic EGFP-positive neurons. Indeed, the EGFP-positive cells in the PT expressed high levels of <i>oxt</i> mRNA in the <i>otpa<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> but not in wild type animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,F</a>)."

These PT OXT neurons are visible in the transgenic reporter probably due to the absence of a genomic repressor element in the reporter. To test this hypothesis, we used a highly sensitive fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) method (<a href=\"#bib47\">Orjalo et al., 2011</a>). The approach is based on a set of FISH probes comprising multiple oligonucleotides with different sequences and fluorescent labels, which collectively bind along the same target transcript to produce a signal of single-molecules. Using this method, the expression of <i>oxt</i> mRNA in PT neurons could be detected in wild type animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013I</a>). Furthermore, wild type embryos that were subjected to in situ hybridization with a DIG-labeled <i>oxt</i> probe followed by long incubation with the NBT/BCIP colorimetric substrate also revealed low level of <i>oxt</i> mRNA in PT neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Moreover, we found that the PT OXT neurons express the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Because OXT neurons are distinguished by the presence of somatodendritic autoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib25\">Freund-Mercier and Stoeckel, 1995</a>), this finding evidences that the seemingly ectopic cells we uncovered by combining the <i>otpa</i> mutant with a transgenic OXT reporter are <i>bona fide</i> OXT neurons."

We observed that the larval PT OXT neurons were intermingled with the pear-shaped tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic neurons (a.k.a group no. 2) that have been well characterized in both larval and adult diencephalon (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rink and Wullimann, 2002</a>). We therefore used TH immunoreactivity as an anatomical landmark to localize the PT OXT neurons in the adult periventricular PT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Our results indicate no major difference in cell size between the NPO and PT OXT groups in the larvae. However, in the adult brain, the PT OXT neurons were similar in their size to the anterior parvocellular preoptic nucleus and were significantly smaller than the known zebrafish magnocellular and gigantocellular neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."

However, analysis of dozens of hypothalamic markers, including transcription factors and neuropeptides, failed to detect differential gene expression between the NPO and PT OXT neurons. During the analysis, we noticed that as reported in mammals (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sawchenko et al., 1984</a>) and zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib31\">Herget and Ryu, 2015</a>), a subset of zebrafish OXT neurons co-express both OXT and the stress neurohormone CRH (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Therefore, we analyzed the expression of <i>crh</i> mRNA in OXT neurons in <i>otpa</i> and <i>otpb</i> mutants. In wild type embryos, approximately 7\u201310% of OXT neurons in both the NPO and PT clusters co-expressed <i>crh</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>). <i>otpa<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mutants, however, displayed an increase in <i>crh</i>-positive OXT neurons in the NPO and a decrease in the PT OXT neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,E,G,H</a>). Moreover, similar analysis of <i>crh</i>-positive OXT neurons in the <i>otpb<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mutant indicated a positive trend for Otpb regulation of <i>crh</i> expression in the PT clusters of OXT neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,H</a>). Notably, previous studies have shown that the total number of CRH+ neurons is not affected in either <i>otpa</i> or <i>otpb</i> mutants reinforcing the notion that the Otp paralogs regulate the balance between <i>crh</i> and <i>oxt</i> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fernandes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amir-Zilberstein et al., 2012</a>)."

Thus, Otpa has opposite effects on the expression of <i>oxt</i> and <i>crh</i> in a subset of OXT neurons residing in the PT and NPO. Otpb, on the other hand, positively regulates these neuropeptides in the PT and has a redundant effect on <i>oxt</i> expression in the NPO.

To explore how specific neuro-developmental changes in hypothalamic OXT neurons might affect behavioral functions, we focused on the PT OXT neuronal cluster for several reasons. First, the predominant <i>otpa<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mutant phenotype, i.e. ectopic OXT expression, was observed in these neurons. Second, unlike the dual central and peripheral (i.e. neurohypophyseal) connections made by the NPO OXT neurons, PT OXT neurons display a prevalent hindbrain and spinal cord projection pattern.

Yet, the exact mechanisms by which developmental factors affect hypothalamic functions are largely unknown. In the present study we link between a critical neuroendocrine transcription factor controlling a discrete neuronal circuit and long-term developmental influence on adult behavior. The evolutionarily conserved transcription factor Otp is essential for the development of hypothalamic neurons and its embryonic knockout in mammals leads to early postpartum lethality (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acampora et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wang and Lufkin, 2000</a>). Taking advantage of the viability and fertility of zebrafish with a single mutation in either of the two paralogous genes, <i>otpa</i> and <i>otpb</i> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fernandes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amir-Zilberstein et al., 2012</a>), we examined the consequences of developmental mutations in Otp proteins on adult physiological functions. Our analysis reveals defects in anxiety- and social-related behavioral responses in adult mutants, which were associated with Otp-dependent developmental neuropeptide switching in a subset of spinal cord-projecting parvocellular OXT neurons. Specific ablation of this OXT cluster at embryonic stage resulted in reduced shoaling behavior, phenocopying the social deficits of the <i>otpa</i> mutant fish. Our study identifies a new role for Otp in regulating developmental neuropeptides switching in a discrete OXT neuronal circuit, whose developmental perturbation influences adult social behavior."

The stimuli were randomized in these two compartments, to avoid a side bias. After an acclimatization period, the focal fish was released from the start box and allowed to explore the arena, and its behavior was video-recorded for 9 min for subsequent analysis. All compartments were separated by sealed transparent partitions, avoiding the access to olfactory stimuli. The time spent by the focal fish close (less that one body length) to each compartment (termed social zone or non-social\u00a0zone) was quantified and taken as a measure of social preference."

The two paralogues appear to have redundant roles on the regulation of Oxt expression in the neurosecretory portion of OXT neurons in the NPO. However, Otpa mutants revealed a novel group of OXT neurons in the posterior tuberculum (PT) that had not been previously described. Oxt is upregulated in Otpa mutants compared to WT and Otpa mutants, revealing a unique role of the Otpa paralogue in suppressing Oxt expression in these cells. Interestingly, Otpa appears to be involved in neuropeptide switching in both NPO and PT, albeit in opposite directions. Otpa mutants have more Oxt/CRF co-expression in the NPO, but less co-expression in the PT. Notably, they report that the neurons mediating this effect are neurons that project to the brainstem and spinal cord. They used single cell analysis to reveal that the PT OXT neurons primarily project to the hindbrain and brainstem. Ablation of the PT OXT neurons developmentally resulted in reduced shoaling behavior but did not affect anxiety behaviors."
