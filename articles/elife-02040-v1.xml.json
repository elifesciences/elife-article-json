How any cell actually senses its own size remains poorly understood. The fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> are rod-shaped cells that grow to \u223c14 \u00b5m in length before entering mitosis. In this study, we provide evidence that these cells sense their surface area as part of this size control mechanism. We show that cells enter mitosis at a certain surface area, as opposed to a certain volume or length. A peripheral membrane protein kinase cdr2p has properties of a dose-dependent \u2018sizer\u2019 that controls mitotic entry. As cells grow, the local cdr2p concentration in nodes at the medial cortex accumulates as a measure of cell surface area. Our findings, which challenge a previously proposed pom1p gradient model, lead to a new model in which cells sense their size by using cdr2p to probe the surface area over the whole cell and relay this information to the medial cortex."

How any cell actually senses its own size remains poorly understood. The fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> are rod-shaped cells that grow to \u223c14 \u00b5m in length before entering mitosis. In this study, we provide evidence that these cells sense their surface area as part of this size control mechanism. We show that cells enter mitosis at a certain surface area, as opposed to a certain volume or length. A peripheral membrane protein kinase cdr2p has properties of a dose-dependent \u2018sizer\u2019 that controls mitotic entry. As cells grow, the local cdr2p concentration in nodes at the medial cortex accumulates as a measure of cell surface area. Our findings, which challenge a previously proposed pom1p gradient model, lead to a new model in which cells sense their size by using cdr2p to probe the surface area over the whole cell and relay this information to the medial cortex."

Individual molecules of cdr2p come together to from clusters called nodes on the cell membrane. As the cell grows larger, more and more cdr2p proteins accumulate in these nodes, which are found in a band around the middle of the cell. When the cells reaches a critical cell size, the increased concentration of cdr2p at these nodes may help to trigger the start of cell division."

Genetic analyses in fission yeast have identified a pathway of conserved protein kinases for cell size control: the DYRK kinase pom1p is an inhibitor of the SAD family kinase cdr2p, which inhibits wee1p, which in turn inhibits the cell division kinase cdk1p (<a href=\"#bib35\">Russell and Nurse, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Breeding et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Moseley et al., 2009</a>). Loss of function of <i>pom1</i> and <i>wee1</i> leads to abnormally short cells, whereas loss of function of <i>cdr2</i> leads to abnormally long ones. Interestingly, these factors largely localize to different sites in the cell. Pom1p localizes in cortical gradients emanating from cell tips (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bahler and Pringle, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Padte et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hachet et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Saunders et al., 2012</a>).

Pom1p cortical gradients exhibit large cell-to-cell variability in intensity and distribution, fluctuate over time in individual cells, and show little consistent change with cell length (<a href=\"#bib36\">Saunders et al., 2012</a>). This variability, plus a short decay length relative to cell length, led us to question whether these gradients can function reliably as \u2018rulers\u2019. One of the key predictions of the gradient-based model is that pom1p levels decrease on the medial cortex as cells grow. We measured pom1p concentration in a 3-\u00b5m region along the medial cortex, where cdr2p nodes are located. Using time-averaged data (reducing fluctuations in the gradient over time [<a href=\"#bib36\">Saunders et al., 2012</a>]), we detected low but measurable intensities (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, measurements of pom1-tomato at the medial cortex showed no detectable decrease with cell length in a population of cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), or in individual cells imaged over time (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). These cortical measurements improve on previously reported pom1p measurements that integrate intensities over the whole cell (<a href=\"#bib23\">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Moseley et al., 2009</a>), which have artifacts stemming from the normal exclusion of pom1p from the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib36\">Saunders et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2,3</a>)."

(2009)</a> and <a href=\"#bib23\">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean (2009)</a> showed, in contrast to what we see, that pom1p levels in the middle of the cell decrease with cell length. In the measurements of these papers, pom1p fluorescence in the whole cell was collapsed onto a single line. This method of image analysis differs from our approach of measuring pom1p intensity only on the cortex, where the gradient distribution is shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. We plotted measurements of pom1p in the middle of the cell as a function of cell length using different methods and data sets. The data from Moseley et al. (Figure S12 of that publication) is presented here (after normalization to the value for cells with length &lt;8.5 \u03bcm) as the black bars. We found a similar trend using the same whole cell analysis on our own images of pom1-tomato cells (blue bars), n &gt; 20 in each binning of cell lengths. pom1p is detectable at a low constant level all through the cytoplasm, but is not detectable in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib36\">Saunders et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Therefore, we tested whether this difference between whole cell and cortical measurements may be due to lack of pom1p in the nucleus. We adjusted for the effect of the nucleus by filling the nucleus with the average cytoplasmic pom1p intensity in silico. This adjustment largely abrogated the length-dependent decrease of pom1p intensity (red bars). We speculate that the decrease seen in the whole cell measurements may be due to the slightly larger size of the nucleus in larger cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Neumann and Nurse, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, the decrease seen in the previous publications may (partially) be an artifact of including cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence in addition to the cortical distribution. Strain used: FC2054.

The cortical area containing the nodes also increased slightly with cell length, but the relative change was less than for the cdr2-GFP intensity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Morrell et al., 2004</a>). Measurement of cdr2-GFP intensity within a 3-\u03bcm wide region of the medial cortex showed directly that the local cdr2p concentration in this region rises approximately twofold as cells grow through interphase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This increase was confirmed in time-lapse analyses of individual cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>)."

Cdr2p was expressed from an <i>nmt81</i> promoter, regulated by thiamine in the media. Mild cdr2p overexpression in the absence of thiamine (estimated 1.6-fold) caused cells to divide at abnormally short cell lengths. Consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib7\">Breeding et al., 1998</a>), higher levels of overexpression caused cytokinesis defects and accumulation of longer cells. Conversely, decreased cdr2p expression led cells to divide at much longer lengths, similar to a <i>cdr2</i> null strain (<a href=\"#bib28\">Morrell et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Moseley et al., 2009</a>). Thus, cdr2p is a dose-dependent regulator of cell size and mitotic entry (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The persistence of cdr2-GFP in cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide showed that the majority of cdr2p is highly stable in interphase cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Together, these findings suggest that as the cell grows, cdr2p is a stable protein that is synthesized to maintain a constant concentration in the whole cell, and accumulates at the medial cortex, where it promotes mitotic entry in a concentration-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

To test these possibilities, we examined cdr2p behavior in cells arrested for cell growth upon treatment with an actin inhibitor Latrunculin A (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ayscough et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chang, 1999</a>). Levels of a simple timer should continue to increase over time, even without cell growth, while a sizer would not increase without cell growth. Latrunculin A-treated cells exhibited no growth and no increase in cdr2-GFP levels at nodes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Next, we compared cdr2p in cells growing at different rates. We used <i>for3\u0394</i> (formin) mutants, which are defective in cell polarity regulation and exhibit highly variable growth rates (<a href=\"#bib16\">Feierbach and Chang, 2001</a>). This mutant allowed us to measure cells in the same microscope field with identical genotype and growth conditions, but with over twofold varying growth rates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Based on our experiments, this model postulates that: (1) the concentration of cdr2p in the cytoplasm is homogeneous and changes only slightly with cell length (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>); (2) cytoplasmic cdr2p molecules can bind all over the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), and subsequently move rapidly by diffusion on the cortex; (3) cortical cdr2p molecules can transition to associate with a nodal region on the medial cortex. Note that the details of the formation and growth of individual nodes are beyond the scope of the model. Rather, we simply model the overall number of cdr2p molecules in the nodal region. (4) Both cortical and nodal cdr2p can then unbind and return cdr2p to the cytoplasm; (5) cytoplasmic cdr2p can then diffuse rapidly before rebinding to the membrane. As the timescale of cell growth (hours) is much slower than the timescale of the cdr2p dynamics (minutes, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), we assumed that the molecular system is, at any given time, effectively in steady state. This steady-state assumption is also consistent with experimental findings that cdr2p levels at nodes are stable over time when cells are not growing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). This model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) was implemented by two mass-action equations for cortical and nodal cdr2p, and solved analytically (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

The simplicity of the model allowed us to clarify the two key elements important for this area sensing. The first is that the area of the nodal region must not scale proportionally with the total cell membrane area as the cell size increases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We then have one process (cdr2p membrane association) that scales proportionally with cell area, with a second process (uptake of cortical cdr2p into the nodes), which does not. The second key element is that the nodal region receives information via cdr2p about the entire surface area of the cell. In this model, cdr2p needs to be able bind the membrane long enough to move on the membrane to reach the nodal region. The outcome is then a rising cdr2p nodal density with increasing cell area. Using the experimentally determined nodal/cortical areas, and with other parameters measured/constrained from our experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we fitted the cdr2p density in the medial nodes as a function of cell length to that measured experimentally, with good results (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Note that wild-type <i>S. pombe</i> cells are rod-shaped and have an approximately constant width, so that surface area and cell length are proportional to one another. A more sophisticated version of the same underlying model, including spatially varying cdr2p on the cortex, generated similar results (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013F</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

The underlying area-sensing mechanism was nevertheless conserved in this alternative model, with similar key elements as discussed above (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

To experimentally test if cdr2p scales with surface area or volume, we analyzed cdr2p levels in <i>S. pombe</i> mutants with different widths, so that surface area and volume are uncoupled. Rga2p and rga4p are Rho-GAPs involved in regulation of cell polarity and width (<a href=\"#bib14\">Das et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Villar-Tajadura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kelly and Nurse, 2011</a>); <i>rga2</i>\u0394 mutants are thinner while <i>rga4</i>\u0394 mutants are fatter than wild type (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

Conversely, in considering cells of similar volume but with a range of different surface areas, cdr2-GFP nodal intensity correlated with surface area and not volume (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). These results thus suggest that nodal cdr2p scales with cell surface area, in agreement with the predictions of the mathematical models."

We measured cell length, surface area and volume in wild-type, <i>rga2</i>\u0394 and <i>rga4</i>\u0394 strains in dividing cells; these dimensions are indicative of the size of the cells at entry into mitosis. These cells with different shapes entered mitosis with more similar cell surface areas but differing cell volumes and lengths (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). All three strains exhibited average surface areas of 150 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> \u00b1 8 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>, while the average volumes varied from 120 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> to 150 \u00b5m<sup>3</sup> and average lengths from 11 \u00b5m to 15 \u00b5m. A more rigorous analysis based on Jensen\u2013Shannon distances (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019) showed quantitatively that the distributions of surface area were more similar than those for volume or length. These findings suggest that cells monitor their size at the G2/M transition by measuring their surface area."

In <i>pom1\u0394</i> mutants, cdr2p is thought to be somehow more \u2018active\u2019 and promotes division at slightly shorter cell lengths than wild type (<a href=\"#bib23\">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Moseley et al., 2009</a>). In <i>pom1\u0394</i> cells, cdr2-GFP is spread in dots throughout much of the cortex, except for the growing cell tip (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Celton-Morizur et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Padte et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Moseley et al., 2009</a>). The total amount of cdr2p in the cell was similar in wild-type and <i>pom1\u0394</i> mutant cells over a range of cell lengths (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Cortical profiles showed that in <i>pom1\u0394</i> cells, cdr2p was still enriched over the medial cortex and that the non-growing end had levels roughly half that of the medial region (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). The fraction of cdr2p that is cortical and the area of nodal cdr2p were both substantially increased in <i>pom1\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). Interestingly, the increase of cortical cdr2p with cell length was similar in <i>pom1</i>\u0394 vs wild-type cells, but the curve was shifted slightly upwards (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). In contrast, in the medial cortical region, cdr2p levels were lower than wildtype (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). A simple interpretation is that cdr2p is able to signal to promote entry into mitosis from nodes on non-medial sites in this mutant. However, another factor to consider is that cdr2p kinase activity may also be altered in these cells. Time-lapse imaging showed that cdr2p nodes are more motile in <i>pom1\u0394</i> cells than in WT (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1, 3</a>), suggesting a defect in the anchoring of these nodes in the membrane. At the growing end, there are also the dim cortical motile cdr2p dots, similar to those present at cell ends in WT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Thus, pom1p affects the distribution and mobility of cdr2p nodes."

We provide evidence that cells sense a critical cell size by measuring cell surface area rather than, for example, cell volume or absolute length, a mechanism that could function regardless of the cell shape. As the cell grows, the concentration of cdr2p at the medial cortex increases. We have developed models explaining how cdr2p probes the surface area of the cell, and conveys this information to the medial cortex. There, cdr2p may signal to cell cycle regulators located on the nearby spindle pole body and nucleus (see below). When the cell reaches a critical size, cdr2p at the nodes may reach a critical local concentration that promotes mitotic entry."

This size-sensing model shares elements with a proposed microtubule length control mechanism termed the \u2018antenna model\u2019. In the microtubule model, longer microtubules bind more motor proteins, which then accumulate at the microtubule end in a length-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib39\">Varga et al., 2006</a>). In the cell size sensing case, the whole surface area of the plasma membrane may be regarded as an \u2018antenna\u2019. Similar to the microtubule model, the property of cdr2p to first bind to the plasma membrane \u2018antenna\u2019 (as opposed to merely binding the nodes directly) is critical for this mechanism to read out cell size. This membrane cdr2p must then transit to the nodal region, where the cdr2p nodal density serves as a read-out of cell area. Although cdr2p may not exhibit directed motor-driven movements, this movement can still occur by diffusion along the membrane. We also considered an alternative model, where cdr2p is modified on the membrane, but after unbinding is able to diffuse through the cytoplasm to the nodes. The modification allows information about membrane area to be preserved in the cytoplasm, from where it can be relayed to the nodes (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Furthermore, as the amount of nodal cdr2p reflects cell size rather than time, we postulate that the system is effectively in a dynamic steady state at a given cell size, with fast cdr2p dynamics compared to the timescales of cell growth."

Previously proposed mechanisms have been based upon nuclear concentration or the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of a sizer, but in many cell types (including fission yeast), nuclear volume also increases as cells grow (<a href=\"#bib31\">Neumann and Nurse, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Second, we speculate that medial cortical placement of nodes surrounding the medial nucleus may allow cdr2p to communicate its local concentration to presumed targets such as wee1p and cdk1p on the nucleus. Although wee1p can be observed at some nodes upon overexpression (<a href=\"#bib29\">Moseley et al., 2009</a>), its localization in late G2-phase is clear in the nucleus, and at the spindle pole body (SPB) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Masuda et al., 2011</a>), a structure on the nuclear envelope situated close (often &lt;0.5 \u03bcm) to the nodes. Cdk1/cyclin B and polo kinase are also located at the SPB and nucleus (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alfa et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Masuda et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Grallert et al., 2013</a>). Potentially, the SPB could detect local gradients of cdr2p (or other molecules) emanating from nearby cortical nodes. However, as a simple cdr2p concentration gradient in the cytoplasm is expected to be very shallow (due to rapid diffusion), it is likely that additional layers of regulation such as through phosphorylation states or diffusion barriers would be needed to generate suitably steep gradients. The potential importance of the geometric relationship between the nodes and SPB/nucleus remains to be tested."

                        "text": "The localization of these nodes to the medial cortical region involves multiple inputs. One important contributor is pom1p. Although pom1p clearly regulates cdr2p function and phosphorylation, our data indicate that the pom1p gradient distribution may not be the primary size sensing mechanism as previously proposed. Indeed, our data are consistent with a recent report that size correction still occurs in <i>pom1\u0394</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wood and Nurse, 2013</a>). Rather, a primary role of pom1p may be to ensure the medial localization of nodes. Thus, pom1p may affect cdr2p nodes in part by affecting distribution and general properties (such as its mobility in the membrane) of the nodes. Recent studies (published while this work was in press) suggest that cdr2p activity is also regulated by phosphorylation by pom1p and ssp1p protein kinases (<a href=\"#bib6a\">Bhatia et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14a\">Deng et al., 2014</a>). Another important factor in cdr2p localization is likely to be the nucleus that is situated in the cell interior with roughly the same width as the nodal region. Studies on mid1p, another component of the nodes, suggest that the nucleus governs dynamic nodal localization, in a mechanism that may involve nuclear shuttling (<a href=\"#bib33\">Paoletti and Chang, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Daga and Chang, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Almonacid et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, the organization of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum also influences nodal stability and localization (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>). There are also likely to be additional (or alternative) inputs into size control (<a href=\"#bib12\">Coudreuse and Nurse, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Navarro and Nurse, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wood and Nurse, 2013</a>). Additional cell size regulators include the cell tip protein nif1p (<a href=\"#bib23\">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wood and Nurse, 2013</a>), and skb1p, which localizes to cortical patches distinct from the nodes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Deng and Moseley, 2013</a>). Cells expressing a cdk1p\u2013cyclinB fusion still exhibit apparently near-normal size control in the absence of wee1p/mik1p or cdk1p-tyrosine phosphorylation control (<a href=\"#bib12\">Coudreuse and Nurse, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Navarro and Nurse, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wood and Nurse, 2013</a>), suggesting the existence of controls that are entirely independent of cdk1\u2013tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, this simple cdr2p-based mechanism is likely to be a core component of a larger network responsible for cell size control."

The rate of change in nodal cdr2p intensity with time was also calculated by a least squares linear fitting. In both the cases, the error on the fit was found for each cell. To test whether a positive correlation between growth and cdr2p accumulation rates was robust, we performed numerical simulations using the distributions of the measured rates, and their errors, to create in silico data. Corresponding to each pair of values in the measured data set, we created a new in silico pair by drawing from Gaussian distributions with widths given by the measured errors in growth rate and cdr2p accumulation rate. We then performed a linear least squares fitting on each in silico data set to find the level of correlation and test whether it was greater than zero\u2014that is whether a positive correlation existed between cdr2p accumulation rate and cell growth rate. Repeating this process 10<sup>6</sup> times, we found a probability of \u223c0.0005 that a positive correlation would be absent. Hence, our conclusion of a positive correlation between the cdr2p accumulation rate and cell growth rate is robust.

Cell perimeters were manually traced, with the mean surface area, A<sub>cor</sub> and mean volume, V, calculated in Matlab assuming radial symmetry around the long axis of the cell (as the cross-section of fission yeast cells are nearly circular).

The range of \u00b1 10\u201320% was taken to ensure we had enough cells included for statistical significance (between 24 and 32 cells), but that the range was reasonably constrained.

To sense cell area we require one process, which here is the association of cdr2p anywhere onto the membrane, to scale proportionally with cell area.

The value of \u03bd is also not important for the behavior of <i>\u03c1</i><sub><i>nod</i></sub> (see above), though we use a value of \u03bd = 0.5 s<sup>\u22121</sup> to ensure low levels of cortical cdr2p, as observed experimentally. We again use the FRAP data to estimate <i>\u03b7</i> = 5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>. Since <i>\u03c1</i><sub><i>nod</i></sub> = <i>(\u03b1/\u03b7) \u03c1</i><sup><i>*</i></sup><sub><i>cyt</i></sub>, we take <i>\u03b1</i> = 0.5 \u00b5ms<sup>\u22121</sup> so that the concentration of modified cdr2p in the nodal region is relatively large compared to that in the cytoplasm (required since there is no observed scaling of cytoplasmic cdr2p concentration with cell length). Further, we use a low rate of spontaneous modification loss \u00b5 = 0.03 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, so that the lifetime of modified, cytoplasmic cdr2p is relatively long.

One process, the unbinding of cortical cdr2p can occur from anywhere on the membrane, and so scales proportionally with cell area. However, a second process, in this case the uptake of modified, cytoplasmic cdr2p into the nodes, occurs over a region whose area does not scale proportionally with the total cell area as the cell grows. The outcome is again a density (for both <i>\u03c1</i><sup><i>*</i></sup><sub><i>cyt</i></sub> and <i>\u03c1</i><sub><i>nod</i></sub>) that scales with total cell membrane area. The presence of the modified form of cdr2p is vital, so that information about membrane area can be protected and relayed to the nodes without being lost into the general cytoplasmic cdr2p population, which does not show size scaling characteristics (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

As the <i>pom1</i>\u0394 experiments demonstrate, without pom1p acting as a tip inhibitor for cdr2p, nodal cdr2p can form in an extended part of the cell, with such cells observed to divide at shorter lengths. Conversely, in pom1p mutants where pom1p is mistargeted all over the plasma membrane, cdr2p does not form localized regions of high nodal concentration, with such cells dividing at longer lengths. Therefore, pom1p appears to play an important role in defining the region of nodal cdr2p accumulation, without which the cdr2p-dependent control of cell length is perturbed. Accordingly, pom1p is implicitly included in the model by defining a spatially limited region that can be occupied by the cdr2p nodes."

Two previous papers from the Moseley/Nurse and Martin labs proposed a model for how <i>S. pombe</i> measures size. The model is based on the observed spatial separation of two antagonistic regulators of cell size (Cdr2 and Pom1). Cdr2 promotes mitotic entry and localizes to medial cortical nodes and Pom1 antagonizes Cdr2 and localizes in a gradient emanating from cell tips. The model proposes that increase in cell length causes reduction in medial Pom1 and activation of Cdr2/mitotic entry. This manuscript challenges the existing model by showing that the concentration of Pom1 at the medial cortex does not change as cells elongate. Based on their data showing that the concentration of Cdr2 at nodes increases with cell size (even though the overall concentration of the protein does not change significantly) the authors propose that cells \u201cmeasure\u201d size through levels of medial Cdr2. A mathematical model is described to explain the size dependent increase in Cdr2 node concentration. Central to this model is the assumption that Cdr2 must first load onto the membrane from where it can laterally diffuse to medial nodes and be incorporated into node structures. In this way, the concentration of Cdr2 in medial nodes would depend on the surface area of the cell."

Thus I think that for the manuscript to constitute a major advance, there needs to be some test of the model. Listed below are several questions I have about the model and potential ways to test it."

The fission yeast <i>S. pombe</i> has a regular rod shape and divides at a reproducible cell length and a constant cell diameter. Combined with other advantages as a model system, the fission yeast is one of the best systems to study the molecular mechanisms of cell-size control. Previous studies have proposed an elegant and simple model for the regulation of cell size: Pom1 polar gradient and Cdr2 kinase-based interphase nodes work together to control mitotic entry and cell size. One line of key evidence of the model is that the Pom1 polar gradient has highest concentration at the cell pole and lowest concentration in cell middle, which decreases as cells grow. When cells reach a certain length, Pom1 gradient cannot inhibit Cdr2 kinase activity in the nodes, then Cdk1 kinase becomes active and cells enter mitosis."

The authors suggest that Cdr2 localization at the medial cortex could generate a concentration gradient that extends to the SPB where the Cdr2 target Wee1 resides. As Cdr2 medial concentration increases with cell elongation, it is proposed that the Cdr2 concentration at the SPB would increase until it is sufficient to inactivate Wee1. I have some concern about this idea because cytoplasmic gradients are likely to be very steep given the high rates of diffusion. Given that the authors know both the Cdr2 concentration at the medial cortex and the turnover rate they could calculate how steep the gradient from the cortex is likely to be and whether the concentration of Cdr2 around the SPB would actually change significantly as cells elongate.

Cdr2 promotes mitotic entry and localizes to medial cortical nodes and Pom1 antagonizes Cdr2 and localizes in a gradient emanating from cell tips. The model proposes that increase in cell length causes reduction in medial Pom1 and activation of Cdr2/mitotic entry. This manuscript challenges the existing model by showing that the concentration of Pom1 at the medial cortex does not change as cells elongate. Based on their data showing that the concentration of Cdr2 at nodes increases with cell size (even though the overall concentration of the protein does not change significantly) the authors propose that cells \u201cmeasure\u201d size through levels of medial Cdr2. A mathematical model is described to explain the size dependent increase in Cdr2 node concentration.

The maximum intensity measurements make sense when the nodes are considered as point sources on the cortex. The sum projections take into account the cytoplasmic and out of focus information that are less relevant here. Therefore, sum projections are considerably noisier than maximum intensity projections. The important point is that the same increasing trend in Cdr2 density is found using all the different approaches. In general, we analyzed data using both maximum and sum projections to confirm that our results were not significantly altered by the choice of method. For the reasons stated above, we typically show the results from maximum intensity projections, although we do use sum projections in measurements of whole cell intensities. We emphasize that our key conclusions are replicable with different analysis methods."

The node number might seem smaller than previous counts, because we used a thresholding approach to count the bright, mature nodes in an objective automated manner. By eye, there are many smaller nodes that are missed in this analysis, but it is difficult to objectively count their number. By eye, we can discern around 60-70, as previously reported (originally by our lab). However, we preferred the automated method to measure the increase in the number of nodes (rather than the absolute number), as the analysis is objective and easier to perform in a large number of cells."

The authors suggest that Cdr2 localization at the medial cortex could generate a concentration gradient that extends to the SPB where the Cdr2 target Wee1 resides. As Cdr2 medial concentration increases with cell elongation, it is proposed that the Cdr2 concentration at the SPB would increase until it is sufficient to inactivate Wee1. I have some concern about this idea because cytoplasmic gradients are likely to be very steep given the high rates of diffusion. Given that the authors know both the Cdr2 concentration at the medial cortex and the turnover rate they could calculate how steep the gradient from the cortex is likely to be and whether the concentration of Cdr2 around the SPB would actually change significantly as cells elongate. This would at least say whether this notion made sense. If so, it would be interesting (in future studies) to examine mutants that caused the SPB to be positioned further away from the cell cortex to see if this changed the timing of mitotic entry</i>."

With \u223c3000 cdr2p molecules in the nodes, the total rate of cdr2p molecules released from all the nodes is \u223c10 s<sup>-1</sup>. Assuming a reasonable diffusion constant, it would take only \u223c10s for a cdr2p molecule to diffuse across the cell, before becoming homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm. Hence, the number of molecules making up the entire cytoplasmic gradient would only be about 100. This is a very low number in comparison with the overall number of cytoplasmic cdr2p molecules, making for a very shallow gradient. Moreover, the localized SPB would only be able to sample a fraction of these gradient molecules, which would increase the noise still further. Thus, it is unlikely that this simplest mechanism based on sensing the number of freely diffusing cdr2p molecules emitted by the nodes would work."
