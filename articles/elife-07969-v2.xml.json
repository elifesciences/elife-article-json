However, the mapping between influenza transmission in ferrets and in humans is unsubstantiated. We address this gap by compiling and analyzing 240 estimates of influenza transmission in ferrets and humans. We demonstrate that estimates of ferret secondary attack rate (SAR) explain 66% of the variation in human SAR estimates at the subtype level. Further analysis shows that ferret transmission experiments have potential to identify influenza viruses of concern for epidemic spread in humans, though small sample sizes and biological uncertainties prevent definitive classification of human transmissibility. Thus, ferret transmission experiments provide valid predictions of pandemic potential of novel influenza strains, though results should continue to be corroborated by targeted virological and epidemiological research."

However, the mapping between influenza transmission in ferrets and in humans is unsubstantiated. We address this gap by compiling and analyzing 240 estimates of influenza transmission in ferrets and humans. We demonstrate that estimates of ferret secondary attack rate (SAR) explain 66% of the variation in human SAR estimates at the subtype level. Further analysis shows that ferret transmission experiments have potential to identify influenza viruses of concern for epidemic spread in humans, though small sample sizes and biological uncertainties prevent definitive classification of human transmissibility. Thus, ferret transmission experiments provide valid predictions of pandemic potential of novel influenza strains, though results should continue to be corroborated by targeted virological and epidemiological research."

Now, Buhnerkempe, Gostic et al. have compared the results of 240 ferret and human studies that aimed to assess how easily strains of influenza spread. Specifically, the studies looked at how often a healthy ferret or human became ill when exposed to an animal or human infected with a particular strain of influenza."

But Buhnerkempe, Gostic et al. caution that ferret studies are not always accurate, partly because they involve small numbers of animals, which can skew the results. There also needs to be more effort to standardize the procedures and measurements used in ferret studies."

Although characterizing human transmissibility of emerging influenza viruses is a perpetual challenge, animal models are often used to characterize transmission among mammals, which can be viewed implicitly as a preliminary screen for pandemic potential in humans. Ferrets are the preferred animal model for influenza transmission studies because clinical signs, pathogenesis and sialic acid distribution are similar in ferrets and humans (<a href=\"#bib33\">Maher and DeStefano, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shinya et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bouvier and Lowen, 2010</a>).

With the U.S. government halting funding and calling for a voluntary moratorium and period of review on such experiments as of October 2014 (<a href=\"#bib57\">White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, 2014</a>), groups on all sides of the debate have issued renewed calls for studies on the link between influenza transmissibility in ferrets and in humans (<a href=\"#bib35\">Morens et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lipsitch, 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Casadevall and Imperiale, 2014</a>).

Using logistic regression, we identified ranges of ferret SAR that characterize supercritical and subcritical influenza viruses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Ferret respiratory droplet SAR was a significant predictor of the probability that a virus is supercritical or subcritical in humans (p &lt; 0.0001; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). By accounting for the uncertainty in this relationship, we identified ranges of ferret SAR that indicate a high probability of strains being identified as supercritical or subcritical (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). However, a range of intermediate ferret SAR values yielded equivocal results (i.e. the 95% confidence interval for classification included a classification probability of 0.5). Direct contact transmission was also a significant predictor of supercritical or subcritical transmission in humans (p = 0.01; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Information theoretic model comparisons showed marginal support for a bivariate model using both respiratory droplet and direct contact transmission data (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Considering the bivariate distribution of SAR estimates, however, it is clear that respiratory droplet SAR has the potential for greater specificity in predicting supercritical transmission (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Binomial uncertainties in ferret SAR data can be substantial, as ethical and logistic considerations limit sample sizes in these experiments (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nishiura et al., 2013</a>). By re-fitting our logistic regression model to 1000 simulated datasets generated by binomial re-sampling of each data point, we found that the relationship between ferret SAR and a supercritical classification is quite robust to this uncertainty (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, while our analysis was fairly insensitive to binomial uncertainty within the aggregate data, attempts to classify SAR estimates from any individual experiment will be more sensitive to binomial uncertainty. For example, we applied our model to the most transmissible strains from two recent GOF studies on H5N1 avian influenza (<a href=\"#bib20\">Imai et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Herfst et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). All three strains had a ferret SAR that fell into the supercritical range, but the confidence intervals for the SAR estimates overlapped with the subcritical and/or equivocal ranges, preventing definitive classification (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Similarly, we found that studies on 1918 pandemic H1N1, a known pandemic strain, had ferret SAR estimates indicative of supercritical transmission, but again wide confidence intervals overlapped the subcritical and equivocal ranges (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). SAR estimates for H7N9, known to be subcritical in humans, spanned the supercritical, subcritical, and equivocal ranges (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Even if results across all ferret respiratory droplet trials for H7N9 were aggregated into a single SAR estimate (representing 42 ferrets in all), we found an equivocal classification of human transmission pattern (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Consequently, care must be taken to avoid over-interpreting the results of ferret transmission studies."

In all analyses, including comparisons of sensitivity and false positive rate of various classification thresholds (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), we found that respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets was a better indicator of transmission in humans than direct contact transmission.

In particular, it is vital to standardize experimental design in order to reduce noise and strengthen inference, beginning with establishing standard definitions of transmission for ferret experiments (i.e. viral titers in nasal washes vs serologic evidence). Discord between viral isolation and antibody data within a single experiment highlights this need and shows that serologic data is often a more sensitive metric of pathogen exposure (<a href=\"#SD2-data SD3-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2, 3</a>). It has been questioned whether seroconversion always reflects a productive viral infection, but recent imaging studies indicate that seroconversion can detect infections that manifest deep in the respiratory tract, which would be missed by nasal wash measurements (<a href=\"#bib22\">Karlsson et al., 2015</a>). Although all of our results were robust to the choice of transmission definition (\u2018Results\u2019 not shown), defining transmission by viral isolation alone slightly increased predictive power for direct contact experiments, and slightly decreased predictive power for respiratory droplet experiments (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Ultimately, this suggests that transmission should be assessed using both serological and viral data to aid in comparisons across experiment types, while allowing for exploration of exposure vs active infection. Dosing protocols can also vary widely across and within studies, in terms of viral titer and volume and even incompatible units. Standardized dosing protocols could reduce variability in ferret SAR estimates substantially. Additional data on time to infection, clinical signs, and mechanistic insights such as receptor binding affinities, none of which are systematically collected under standard protocols, could add value to ferret studies by giving additional power to differentiate among influenza viruses and subtypes with similar transmission outcomes."

Our results show that ferret experiments provide a tool with relatively high sensitivity and specificity for identifying strains that may be supercritical in humans (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Based on current scientific knowledge, risk screening might also incorporate high-throughput virologic and genetic screens used to identify isolates of concern by looking for genetic changes associated with altered binding affinities and other markers of transmission in mammals (<a href=\"#bib42\">Russell et al., 2012</a>). Ultimately, however, human transmission is a complex and partially understood phenotype that is difficult to predict using these initial screens (<a href=\"#bib43\">Russell et al., 2014</a>). Ferrets can provide a potential link between underlying virologic and genetic changes and potential transmissibility in humans. Future analyses should attempt to simultaneously incorporate data on the presence of specific mutations (e.g., PB2-K627E, <a href=\"#bib51\">Van Hoeven et al., 2009</a>) and virologic factors (e.g., binding to \u03b12-6 sialic acid glycans, <a href=\"#bib2\">Belser et al., 2008</a>) into the present analysis of ferret transmissibility to determine if these genetic and virologic screens provide additional information on human transmission not captured by ferrets alone."

As a first assessment of the effect of within-subtype variation, we re-ran our analyses in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> for a broader dataset including H5N1 and H7N9 strains isolated from avian hosts (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 4</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Additional data on consensus viral sequences within human outbreaks are needed to relate human SAR estimates more specifically to isolates tested in ferrets and clarify the effect of within-subtype variation on predicted human transmission behavior. In the absence of these data, our analysis represents a new null model against which deviations within subtypes can be measured to identify strains that can provide additional information on the molecular features associated with transmissible phenotypes in ferrets and/or humans."

Our results at least partially assuage these concerns. In spite of the substantial variation we observed within H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes, our results show that, statistically, isolates more transmissible in ferrets are more likely to be capable of sustained transmission in humans. Yet our data also demonstrate that the ferret transmission model is fallible: for H7N9, an emerging virus of great concern, ferret transmission experiments sometimes yield results that obviously contradict observed patterns in humans. These results are anomalous within the general mapping of ferret transmissibility to human transmissibility and thus, as mentioned previously, may present an opportunity to gain new insight into the molecular drivers of this complex phenotype. However, when screening emerging influenza viruses for pandemic potential, both false negatives and false positives have important consequences for health policy decisions. The deviations of H7N9 from the general correlation between human and ferret transmissibility underscore the importance of corroborating transmission estimates from the ferret model with other lines of evidence. The ultimate evidence to corroborate human transmission comes from epidemiological patterns of infection in humans. For a true pandemic influenza virus, however, such data are likely to come too late, highlighting the need for reliable methods to provide early warning on strains with pandemic potential."

Given the continued use of ferrets in other areas of influenza research (e.g., vaccine development), this finding enhances the broad value of ferret experiments. However, given pragmatic limitations on sample sizes in ferret studies, uncertainties in ferret SAR estimates are likely to limit the operational utility of these guidelines. This coupled with the biological complexities underlying transmissibility suggests that, at this time, ferret transmission data provide a valuable but imperfect correlate of human transmissibility, and further evidence is needed to assess whether other lines of evidence can improve this predictive capacity."

Ad hoc SAR estimates are obtained by taking the ratio of infected household contacts over total household contacts. This method is widely used, but may overestimate SAR, as it assumes each household experiences only one disease introduction (the index case) and ignores the possibility of multiple household exposures to an exogenous reservoir (<a href=\"#bib32\">Longini et al., 1982</a>). Meanwhile, maximum likelihood procedures for SAR estimation use statistical models to simultaneously estimate the probability of secondary transmission within a household (SAR) and the probability of infection from the community (or other source). Thus, these estimates attempt to correct for the possibility of multiple introductions from an exogenous source (<a href=\"#bib31\">Longini and Koopman, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Longini et al., 1982</a>). However, even these estimates can be strongly skewed by the inclusion or exclusion of specific clusters, especially early in an outbreak when data is limited (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aditama et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, variation in existing, population-level immunity to specific strains, and the use of different case ascertainment methods in specific studies also inevitably skew estimates made using either procedure. Because each method has unique biases and limitations, we used published estimates of SAR based on either method, or calculated an ad hoc SAR estimate ourselves from data on the total and infected number of household contacts in an outbreak. Human SAR estimates are only considered in our initial regression analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), so they do not influence our classification model (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."

Thus, our data set contained a total of 81 respiratory droplet (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>) and 76 direct contact transmission trials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 3</a>)."

We also excluded data from studies of zoonotic strains where prior contact with potential livestock or wildlife reservoirs was noted for multiple contacts, thus hindering the distinction between primary and secondary cases. In order to represent a broad range of human SAR estimates, we included both prospective and retrospective household studies that either provided an explicit SAR estimate or reported data sufficient to calculate a SAR. This yielded a total of 83 estimates of human SAR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Because human SAR estimates are not typically made for individual isolates, the comparison was done at the subtype level using the mean value of all estimates belonging to a subtype. For ferret experiments, we used a weighted mean by subtype, where the weights were given by the number of ferrets used in each experiment; for human estimates, we used the simple mean by subtype. The potential uncertainty in subtype mean SAR was large, especially for human SAR, where several emerging subtypes (i.e. H7N3, H9N2, H7N7, and H7N2) only had one or two estimates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To allow for this uncertainty, we used a weighted linear regression with model weights given by the number of human SAR estimates."

This was calculated by comparing the more transmissible and less transmissible of each of the subtypes, taking the minimum SAR estimate for the more transmissible subtype and the maximum SAR estimate for the less transmissible subtype, and counting the number of estimates for both subtypes that fell within this range of overlap (normalized by the total number of estimates for both subtypes). This yielded a measure between 0 and 1, where zero indicated that the ranges of observed SAR estimates for two subtypes were completely distinct and one indicated that the ranges completely overlapped, rendering the subtypes indistinguishable on the basis of SAR."

H1N1, H3N2, pH1N1, and H2N2 are supercritical subtypes with sustained transmission among humans; H7N2, H7N7, H9N2, and H7N3 are subcritical subtypes with weak transmission among humans. This grouping suggests there may be potential to use ferret SAR estimates for broader functional classification of viruses with or without pandemic potential. However, two subtypes of concern, H7N9 and H5N1 (both known to be subcritical in humans), were anomalies within the natural clusters we observed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>: H7N9 clustered with supercritical subtypes, while H5N1 was weakly associated with both groups. We interpreted this as important biological variation within the group of subcritical subtypes, but considering the overarching interest in predicting whether particular subtypes might have pandemic potential, for our further analyses we chose to group subtypes according to their observed transmission pattern in humans (i.e. supercritical\u2014H1N1, H3N2, pH1N1, H2N2 and subcritical\u2014H7N3, H9N2, H7N7, H7N2, H5N1, H7N9)."

Ferret SAR estimates that corresponded to a high probability of an isolate being classified as supercritical or subcritical (i.e. low probability of being supercritical) were determined by calculating 95% confidence intervals for the predicted model fit and identifying the ranges where these confidence intervals were either wholly above (supercritical) or wholly below (subcritical) a value of 0.5 (representing a random guess of supercritical or not). The sensitivity and specificity of various thresholds in ferret SAR were also assessed (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

This has notable bearing on the direct contact transmissibility analysis of this study, as viruses which transmit poorly by respiratory droplets are often able to lead to low-level seroconversion of na\u00efve ferrets when placed in direct contact. If you are counting these low-level seroconversions as true virus transmission events, it is not surprising that the data regarding SAR from direct contact transmission exhibits greater variability and less statistical weight. You should disclose more fully this potential caveat in your analysis and interpretation of direct contact ferret transmission SAR."

So the questions that arise are: conditional on being considered high-enough risk to merit ferret studies, what additional value do the ferret studies add? Should we really be doing ferret studies first? If so, what should be the means of follow-up?"

This has several implications. First, not everyone will note the subtlety but it probably affects the results of the study (it might have looked different if bird isolates tested in ferrets had been included). Second, it highlights the point that subtype is not an ideal level of aggregation, though it is needed for the reasons you discuss. Third, it emphasizes the ambiguity of the assessment of pandemic potential. If a strain that is nontransmissible in ferrets can change in possibly a single human passage into one that is, which readout in the ferrets gives the better estimate of pandemic potential?"
