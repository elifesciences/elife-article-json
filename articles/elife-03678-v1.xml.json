Recently, however, a team of researchers led by Sjors Scheres of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) and Yigong Shi of Tsinghua University showed that cryo-EM can also be used for smaller, asymmetrical membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib10\">Lu et al., 2014</a>). They did this by working out the structure of an enzyme called the human \u03b3-secretase complex at a resolution of 4.5 \u00c5: this enzyme cleaves a variety of proteins within cells, and if it does not work properly, the end result can be Alzheimer's disease. The ordered regions of this complex have a molecular mass of 170 kilodaltons (kDa), which was previously thought to be too small for cryo-EM, even when the latest direct electron detectors were being used. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Scheres describes the methods that have made this breakthrough possible (<a href=\"#bib13\">Scheres, 2014</a>)."

Instead, a thin film (ideally not much thicker than the molecule itself) of an aqueous solution is rapidly frozen on a support grid\u2014so rapidly that the water has no time to crystallize. The vitrified sample is then placed in the high vacuum of the electron microscope, where it is cooled with liquid nitrogen to \u2212180\u00b0C. Projection images of multiple copies of the molecule, suspended in random orientations in the vitrified film, are recorded with a beam of 200 kV or 300 kV electrons, and the structure of the molecule is determined by combining the projection images into a 3D molecular volume in a computer."

This works better for larger particles that are more easily visible, and therefore there is a lower size limit in cryo-EM, which until now was thought to be around 300 kDa. However, it should be noted that, with perfect images, theoretical considerations (<a href=\"#bib6\">Henderson, 1995</a>) indicate a lower size limit of 38 kDa."

Low contrast is the inevitable consequence of the fact that all biological objects and their components\u2014proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids\u2014are radiation-sensitive. In order to determine their structures in atomic detail, as is necessary to understand how they function in the cell, only very low electron doses can be applied. Exposures above a critical limit break covalent bonds irreversibly, destroying the very detail we want to know about."

However, much larger movements usually occur when the electron beam hits a biological specimen, possibly due to the release of stresses that result from the sample and the gird and film that support it all having different thermal expansion coefficients. Electron irradiation breaks covalent bonds and creates gas molecules (such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and methane) that push through the ice to escape. These unavoidable beam-induced movements have made it extremely difficult to collect high-resolution electron micrographs of biological macromolecules in the past."

The new direct electron detectors are both more sensitive and much faster than conventional media. Instead of a single, second-long exposure, they record movies at a rate of many frames per second. Successive movie frames are compared in order to detect any movements on the \u00c5 scale. Once the movements of the particles have been traced, they can be reversed in the computer. The movie frames are then added up to give one much sharper, motion-corrected image."

A program suite based on maximum likelihood and prior knowledge (such as a reference volume) about the structure to be determined (<a href=\"#bib12\">Scheres, 2012</a>) has taken the field by storm. The new software works largely without user intervention and provides objective resolution criteria that have quickly become the \u2018gold standard\u2019 in cryo-EM. Standardized validation procedures make results more reliable (<a href=\"#bib11\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>) and produce clearer maps by helping to avoid over-fitted noise (<a href=\"#bib14\">Scheres and Chen, 2012</a>) that has bedeviled many of the previously published single-particle cryo-EM structures. Powerful classification schemes separate different molecules (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amunts et al., 2014</a>) or distinct structural states of the same molecule (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fernandez et al., 2013</a>) that may be simultaneously present in one field of view.

This has resulted in the structure of the \u03b3-secretase complex at 4.5 \u00c5 resolution (from 144,000 particles), and also in significant improvements of several other structures.
