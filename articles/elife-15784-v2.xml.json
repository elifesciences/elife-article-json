                    "text": "Myelin is best known for its role in increasing the conduction velocity and metabolic efficiency of long-range excitatory axons. Accordingly, the myelin observed in neocortical gray matter is thought to mostly ensheath excitatory axons connecting to subcortical regions and distant cortical areas. Using independent analyses of light and electron microscopy data from mouse neocortex, we show that a surprisingly large fraction of cortical myelin (half the myelin in layer 2/3 and a quarter in layer 4) ensheathes axons of inhibitory neurons, specifically of parvalbumin-positive basket cells. This myelin differs significantly from that of excitatory axons in distribution and protein composition. Myelin on inhibitory axons is unlikely to meaningfully hasten the arrival of spikes at their pre-synaptic terminals, due to the patchy distribution and short path-lengths observed. Our results thus highlight the need for exploring alternative roles for myelin in neocortical circuits."

This correlation is influenced by antibody characteristics, but also the size of targets, with smaller targets displaying larger spatial variability from section to section. This could explain the lower R for NF-H which labels axons, as some axons can be very thin (&lt;100 nm). The comparison with an antibody against an <i>overlapping antigen</i> is a test for the specificity of staining. The following comparisons were done: MBP/PLP, GABA/GAD2, PV/GABA, NFHch/NFHr, \u03b1Tub/ac \u03b1Tub. The lower coefficients for GABA/GAD2 and PV/GABA reflect the fact that GAD2 and PV are present in only a subset of GABA containing structures. Another test for specificity is the comparison with an antibody against a spatially <i>exclusive antigen</i>. Values of R around 0 are expected in this case. MBP and PLP (present in the myelin sheath) were each compared with GABA (inside inhibitory neurons); GABA and PV (inhibitory neurons) were compared with VGluT1 (excitatory neurons); NFH, \u03b1Tub and ac \u03b1Tub (all predominantly neuronal) with glutamine synthetase (glial). And finally, all antibodies were compared with DAPI to control for background <i>nuclear</i> staining."

Accordingly, the myelin observed in neocortical gray matter is thought to mostly ensheath excitatory axons connecting to subcortical regions and distant cortical areas. Using independent analyses of light and electron microscopy data from mouse neocortex, we show that a surprisingly large fraction of cortical myelin (half the myelin in layer 2/3 and a quarter in layer 4) ensheathes axons of inhibitory neurons, specifically of parvalbumin-positive basket cells. This myelin differs significantly from that of excitatory axons in distribution and protein composition. Myelin on inhibitory axons is unlikely to meaningfully hasten the arrival of spikes at their pre-synaptic terminals, due to the patchy distribution and short path-lengths observed. Our results thus highlight the need for exploring alternative roles for myelin in neocortical circuits."

This correlation is influenced by antibody characteristics, but also the size of targets, with smaller targets displaying larger spatial variability from section to section. This could explain the lower R for NF-H which labels axons, as some axons can be very thin (&lt;100 nm). The comparison with an antibody against an <i>overlapping antigen</i> is a test for the specificity of staining. The following comparisons were done: MBP/PLP, GABA/GAD2, PV/GABA, NFHch/NFHr, \u03b1Tub/ac \u03b1Tub. The lower coefficients for GABA/GAD2 and PV/GABA reflect the fact that GAD2 and PV are present in only a subset of GABA containing structures. Another test for specificity is the comparison with an antibody against a spatially <i>exclusive antigen</i>. Values of R around 0 are expected in this case. MBP and PLP (present in the myelin sheath) were each compared with GABA (inside inhibitory neurons); GABA and PV (inhibitory neurons) were compared with VGluT1 (excitatory neurons); NFH, \u03b1Tub and ac \u03b1Tub (all predominantly neuronal) with glutamine synthetase (glial). And finally, all antibodies were compared with DAPI to control for background <i>nuclear</i> staining."

The axons of the central nervous system (CNS) connecting distant brain areas are typically wrapped in myelin, as are the axons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that connect the CNS to all skeletal muscles and many sensory neurons. Pathologies of myelinated axons are associated with numerous neurological disorders (<a href=\"#bib32\">Fields, 2008</a>) and are fundamental to several, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) (<a href=\"#bib101\">Popescu and Lucchinetti, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Calabrese et al., 2015</a>), neuromyelitis optica (<a href=\"#bib120\">Wingerchuk et al., 2015</a>), and leukodystrophies (<a href=\"#bib45\">Gordon et al., 2014</a>)."

Recent findings have cast myelination as a dynamic process playing an active role in normal neural circuit function and plasticity. For example, adult-born oligodendrocytes (the myelin-producing cells of the CNS) contribute new myelin to axons in an ongoing fashion (<a href=\"#bib123\">Young et al., 2013</a>), increased neuronal activity results in more myelination (<a href=\"#bib42\">Gibson et al., 2014</a>), and myelin remodeling in the CNS is required for motor skill acquisition (<a href=\"#bib88\">McKenzie et al., 2014</a>).

Excitatory pyramidal neurons in cortex are known to be a main source of long-range myelinated axons connecting the two cortical hemispheres or targeting subcortical structures. Foundational EM-based studies of individual Golgi- or dye-filled neurons (<a href=\"#bib70\">Kisv\u00e1rday et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Martin and Whitteridge, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Peters and Proskauer, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib112\">Tam\u00e1s et al., 1997</a>) have revealed that the local axon collaterals of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons may also be myelinated. However, population surveys of the distribution of myelin on the axonal arbor of individual neocortical neurons have been difficult to undertake with traditional methods. Golgi labeling of neurons halts where the axon first enters a myelin sheath (<a href=\"#bib99\">Peters and Proskauer, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">DeFelipe et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Fair\u00e9n et al., 1977</a>), and bulk labeling of myelin reveals a laminar patterned thicket (<a href=\"#bib95\">Nieuwenhuys, 2013</a>), rather than individual neuronal arbors."

Myelin tracing in large EM datasets has revealed that myelination of the axons of pyramidal neurons in cortex is distinct from the known myelination patterns in subcortical white matter, and also differs between cortical layers (<a href=\"#bib115\">Tomassy et al., 2014</a>). About 10\u201320% of neocortical neurons are inhibitory and some of these neurons may also have myelinated axons. For example, labeling of individual neocortical neurons during in vivo electrophysiological recording, followed by light-level reconstruction and electron microscopy (EM) of selected sub-arbors, has revealed that inhibitory neurons may be myelinated (<a href=\"#bib26\">DeFelipe et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Somogyi et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Kisvarday et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib114\">Thomson et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib112\">Tam\u00e1s et al., 1997</a>). Complementary immunohistochemical studies have shown that parvalbumin-positive (i.e., putative inhibitory [<a href=\"#bib106\">Rudy et al., 2011</a>]) axons may be myelinated (<a href=\"#bib86\">McGee et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chung and Deisseroth, 2013</a>). Given that cortical interneuron types are implicated in distinct circuit functions (<a href=\"#bib68\">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</a>) and have distinct behavioral correlates (<a href=\"#bib73\">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</a>), these results raise several important questions regarding the organization of neocortical neuronal networks: how widespread is inhibitory axon myelination? Is it specific to certain interneuron subtypes? Does inhibitory axon myelin differ from excitatory axon myelin at the molecular level?"

We find that an unexpectedly large proportion of myelinated axons in cortex arise from a specific subtype of inhibitory neuron: the parvalbumin-positive (PV+) basket cell. These PV+ axons are especially prominent in the middle cortical layers. They constitute about half of all myelinated axons in layers 2/3, and a quarter of myelinated axons in layer 4. We also find that the inhibitory myelinated axons in cortical gray matter differ from the excitatory myelinated axons in many respects, such as their structural organization, cytoskeletal content, and myelin protein composition. Taken together, the abundance and cell-type selectivity of neocortical myelinated inhibitory axons described here raise fundamental questions about the role of myelination both in normal function and in disease."

Array tomography (AT) is based on digital reconstruction of images acquired from arrays of serial ultrathin sections (70 nm) attached to coverslips and imaged with different modalities, such as immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The use of ultrathin sections allows the unambiguous light level identification of individual myelinated axons even in regions with high myelin density (e.g., subcortical white matter), while the possibility of applying multiple immunofluorescent markers (10 or more) enables the molecular characterization of these axons. Conjugate SEM further reveals the underlying ultrastructure. TEMCA-based volume electron microscopy uses an array of high-speed cameras to efficiently image large numbers of serial ultrathin (40\u201350 nm) sections. The resulting image volumes are of sufficient size and resolution that the densely packed and intertwined axons and dendrites of the brain neuropil can be traced over relatively long distances, and the synaptic connections between them can be discerned. With this form of EM, all membranes and synapses are labeled, enabling neuronal structure and connectivity to be sampled in an unbiased fashion. Additional evidence was also obtained using immunohistochemical labeling of brain slices from transgenic mice expressing fluorophores in salient inhibitory interneuron subtypes. The EM and AT studies were initiated and conducted independently in two different laboratories and data were pooled once the complementary nature of the findings were ascertained (Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods)."

The abundance of myelin proteins, such as myelin basic protein (MBP), and the size of myelinated axons (&gt;200 nm in diameter) make them an ideal target for immunofluorescence detection (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The ultrathin AT sections provide easy access of the antibodies against MBP and do not require lipid extraction. Conjugate light-electron AT confirms that immunofluorescence for MBP precisely outlines the myelinated sheaths of axons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Overall, the MBP immunolabel is of high quality as evidenced by the consistency of the signal from section to section (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), and the low background (mean gray value of 248 \u00b1 6 a.u. on resin and 279 \u00b1 2 a.u. on nuclei, vs 5754 \u00b1 226 a.u. on myelin, mean and standard error). In addition, the use of ultrathin sections ensures that antigens can be detected equally well within myelinated and unmyelinated portions of the axon. For example, in our AT experiments GABA and PV immunostaining within axons is not affected by myelination (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>, 3), in contrast to preembedding immunocytochemistry where myelinated portions of axons are much more weakly stained (<a href=\"#bib97\">Pawelzik et al., 2002</a>)."

Immunostaining for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA reveals that a surprisingly large number of myelinated axons throughout cortex contain GABA, including more than 45% of myelinated axons in layers 2/3 (48.1 \u00b1 3.2%, mean \u00b1 standard error, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Layers 4 and 5 exhibit similar numbers of GABA myelinated axons as layers 2/3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), but the deeper layers contain larger numbers of non-GABA myelinated axons, presumably of projecting pyramidal cells.

This dataset was of sufficient size and resolution that both myelinated and unmyelinated axons could be traced over hundreds of microns, allowing them to be categorized on the basis of their synaptic ultrastructure as inhibitory or excitatory. A section from near the middle of the EM volume was selected, and all the myelin profiles from the center portion of this section were annotated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Each of these myelinated 'seeds' (e.g. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,E</a>) was used as a starting point for further tracing of the myelinated axon through the EM volume. Along their length, a majority of the traced axons unmyelinated and made a number of synapses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,F</a>). Axons were classified according to the appearance of the pre- and postsynaptic densities of the synapses they made, using the classical definitions for asymmetrical (excitatory) and symmetrical (inhibitory) synapses (<a href=\"#bib21\">Colonnier, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Peters et al., 1991</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,G</a>).

About half of them contain parvalbumin (PV), a calcium buffering protein. Array tomography (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) revealed that nearly all GABA myelinated axons (97.9 \u00b1 0.8%, mean \u00b1 st.error from 3 animals) are immunopositive for parvalbumin and therefore originate from PV interneurons. Correspondingly, in the examined cortical AT volumes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>), examples of PV and GABA-positive cell bodies forming myelinated axons are seen in layers 2/3, 4 and 5. Blind to the AT results, we conducted independent experiments in three mice expressing the fluorescent protein tdTomato driven by Cre expression in PV neurons (<i>Pvalb-ires-Cre;Ai9</i>) (<a href=\"#bib113\">Taniguchi et al., 2011</a>). Confocal imaging of 40\u2009\u03bcm thick Vibratome slices from these mice immunostained with MBP corroborated the AT findings by showing that about half (53 \u00b1 12%) of the myelinated axons in layer 2/3 of somatosensory cortex contain tdTomato and, therefore, PV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). Similar experiments were also performed on mice expressing tdTomato from SOM-Cre or VIP-Cre driver lines (<i>Sst-ires-Cre;Ai9</i>, and <i>Vip-ires-Cre;Ai9</i>) (<a href=\"#bib113\">Taniguchi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Madisen et al., 2010</a>). After careful inspection of selected subareas, no myelinated axons containing reporter for the non-PV cortical interneurons vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a>) could be observed. A small fraction (4.4%) of somatostatin (SOM)-positive myelinated axons were observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H\u2013J</a>); however, the transgenic reporter line used was recently found to have a small but consistent false-positive expression pattern, wherein up to 10% of Cre-expressing neurons are SOM-negative and PV-positive when examined by immunohistochemistry (<a href=\"#bib58\">Hu et al., 2013</a>). At least some of the SOM-positive myelinated axon profiles we observe therefore may be false positives which actually express PV, not SOM; and some may be true positives, consistent with the AT data, which show that ~2% of GABA myelinated profiles are PV negative. Regardless, the data obtained from the three Cre-lines support the conclusion that the great preponderance of myelinated inhibitory axon profiles in layer 2/3 arise from parvalbumin-positive axons."

Because these different cell types are known to have distinct axonal morphology and targets, we traced the postsynaptic targets of inhibitory myelinated axons in layer 2/3 from the volume EM data set in an effort to understand their originating cell type (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The postsynaptic targets were identified as inhibitory or excitatory according to previously described ultrastructural criteria (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bock et al., 2011</a>) (Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Briefly, postsynaptic dendrites were classified as inhibitory if they were largely aspinous and densely coated with asymmetric (excitatory) synapses (e.g. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013F</a>), while they were classified as excitatory if they were spiny and received fewer shaft excitatory synapses. Excitatory somata were distinguished from inhibitory somata based on cell shape, the presence of a large apical dendrite, and the absence of asymmetric contacts on the soma. For each synapse, the postsynaptic compartmental location and class (excitatory or inhibitory) was tabulated (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), and postsynaptic class was used to color-code the synapses along the reconstructed axonal fragments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>)."

Basket cells and chandelier cells can readily be distinguished by their morphology and synaptic targets. When the axons from multiple basket cells are labeled and examined at the light level, they form \u2018baskets\u2019 of synapses around neuronal somata, hence the name (<a href=\"#bib71\">Kisv\u00e1rday, 1992</a>). Chandelier cells have an axonal arbor which resembles a chandelier, with vertically oriented axonal cartridges that almost exclusively form synapses onto the axon initial segments of pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib109\">Somogyi et al., 1982</a>). Less than 2% of the inhibitory myelinated axons in our volume electron microscopy dataset were found to make contacts on axon initial segments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In addition, the few axonal arbors that were seen contacting axon initial segments did not have the characteristic appearance of chandelier cell axons and made single contacts with axonal initial segments, instead of several (typically 3\u20135 for chandelier cells) synapses in a row (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Therefore we can exclude the possibility that the myelinated inhibitory axons arise from chandelier cells. The great preponderance (93%) of postsynaptic targets of myelinated inhibitory axons in layer 2/3 of cortex were excitatory, likewise eliminating the possibility that these axons originated from the arbors of the known parvalbumin-positive long-range inhibitory afferents to cortex, all of which selectively target inhibitory neurons (<a href=\"#bib34\">Freund and Guly\u00e1s, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Gritti et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Henny and Jones, 2008</a>)."

Although neocortical basket cells are best known for their synapses with cell bodies, a large (but variable) fraction of their synapses are with dendritic shafts and spines (<a href=\"#bib110\">Somogyi et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Kisvarday et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib112\">Tam\u00e1s et al., 1997</a>). Consistent with past surveys of basket cell synaptic targets, we found that 13% of the postsynaptic targets of the myelinated inhibitory axons were with somata, 49% were onto excitatory dendritic shafts, and 30% were onto dendritic spines (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Thus, we conclude that the majority of myelinated inhibitory axons belong to the intracortical axons of parvalbumin containing basket cells."

All of the axonal arbors that were traced back to the cell body in our volume EM dataset (n=8) had the same general appearance: a central core of partially myelinated axons (whose unmyelinated stretches rarely made synapses), from which emerged unmyelinated branches forming numerous synapses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5A,C</a>).

Using a deconvolved array tomography dataset with MBP and GABA immunofluorescence, we found that the average myelin thickness was 0.13 \u00b1 0.002\u2009\u03bcm for both GABA and non-GABA axons (mean \u00b1 standard error, n=163 GABA and 238 non-GABA axons from layers 4 and 5, p=0.88, Mann-Whitney U Test) and it did not correlate with axon thickness (R=0.008; n=163 GABA and 238 non-GABA axons from layers 4 and 5). Greater axon diameters not accompanied by changes in myelin thickness result in the g-ratio increasing as a function of axon diameter (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>).

While the average PLP immunofluorescence was very similar in both types of axons (2229 \u00b1 60 a.u. vs 2282 \u00b1 40 a.u., for GABA and non-GABA axons respectively; mean \u00b1 standard error, n=254 GABA axons and 489 non-GABA, p=0.2713, Mann-Whitney U Test, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>), GABA myelinated axons had almost 20% higher MBP immunofluorescence (5263 \u00b1 117 a.u. vs. 4486 \u00b1 63 a.u., mean \u00b1 standard error, n=254 GABA axons and 489 non-GABA, p&lt;0.0001, Mann-Whitney U Test). This difference in MBP content was not related to the thickness of the axons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>).

Nodes of Ranvier were excluded and only non-myelinated stretches longer than 4\u2009\u03bcm were considered. This analysis revealed several interesting differences (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). First, the cytoskeletal composition of axons is indeed related to the presence of GABA. Both the myelinated and the unmyelinated regions of the GABA axons have higher neurofilament content and lower microtubule content compared to non-GABA axons. There are also significant differences in cytoskeletal content between the different regions of GABA axons, where myelinated portions have higher neurofilament and lower microtubule content compared to the unmyelinated portions of the same axons. While excitatory axons show similar trends of differences in cytoskeletal composition depending on myelination, the differences are more pronounced for GABA axons, especially regarding neurofilament content."

Based on cellular morphology and postsynaptic targets, other PV-expressing neuron types were essentially ruled out, and we found minimal evidence for the myelination of non-PV inhibitory axons. Although this cell-type-specificity of axon myelination was unexpected, especially since myelin has generally been thought to ensheath long-range axons of excitatory neurons, it is nevertheless consistent with earlier observations of individual myelinated inhibitory axons, including basket cell axons (<a href=\"#bib99\">Peters and Proskauer, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">DeFelipe et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Somogyi et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Keller and White, 1987</a>)."

Work based on each method was initiated independently and in parallel, and initial annotation and analysis was performed blind to preliminary results arising from the other method. The results from AT and volume EM were complementary. The AT data spanned all cortical laminae and revealed that many myelinated axons in mouse somatosensory cortex (almost half of layer 2/3, and a quarter of layer 4 myelinated axons) contain the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Practically all of these GABA axons also contain PV. AT-based comparison of GABA and nonGABA myelinated axons revealed several important differences. The nodes of Ranvier and the internodes are significantly shorter on GABA axons. In addition, AT multiplex imaging detected molecular differences, such as an enrichment of MBP in the myelin of GABA axons, as well as a high neurofilament and low microtubule content of their cytoskeleton."

Ultrastructural analysis also allowed us to deduce which of the two PV-expressing subtypes in neocortex was myelinated, by revealing that the myelinated axons\u2019 postsynaptic targets were largely non-axonal, instead targeting the dendrites and somata of pyramidal cells. This finding ruled out PV-positive chandelier cells (which synapse onto axons), and strongly suggested that the other predominant PV subtype, basket cells, is the myelinated subtype. PV basket cells comprise about half of all neocortical interneurons (<a href=\"#bib83\">Markram et al., 2004</a>).

However, the lack of PV immunostaining in some myelinated axons may reflect limitations of immunodetection rather than proving that these axons are PV-negative. Furthermore, the SOM-Cre-line used in this study was found to have a small but consistent false-positive expression pattern, where Cre is expressed in neurons that immunohistochemically are somatostatin-negative but PV-positive (<a href=\"#bib58\">Hu et al., 2013</a>). Although additional studies of somatostatin-positive interneurons, as well as other inhibitory interneuron subtypes, will be needed to resolve this issue, we believe it does not materially affect our finding that the great preponderance of myelinated inhibitory axon profiles in layer 2/3 arise from parvalbumin positive basket cells."

Myelinated axon profiles were traced until they exited the myelin sheath and formed a sufficient number of synapses to categorize the axon as excitatory or inhibitory, at which point tracing was halted (except in two cases, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>, where the entire arbor within the 450 \u00d7 350 \u00d7 50\u2009\u03bcm EM volume was traced). The result was a set of axon fragments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) that cannot be positively identified according to morphological type. Their identification as arising from basket cells is based on a combination of immunolabeling results (that myelinated inhibitory axons are nearly always PV+) with the identification of the fragments\u2019 post-synaptic targets as being almost entirely non-axonal (so the axons do not arise from chandelier cells, the other PV+ cell type besides basket cells). Ideally, direct confirmation of this deduction would also be obtained from complete volume EM axonal arbor reconstructions and subsequent confirmation of morphological type. However, the additional tracing effort to achieve this would be substantial (<a href=\"#bib53\">Helmstaedter, 2013</a>), and, perhaps more importantly, such an investment might better be made in a larger cortical EM volume (e.g [<a href=\"#bib74\">Lee et al., 2016</a>]), so that a greater fraction of each neuron\u2019s axonal arbor could be reconstructed. Such an approach would also permit assessment of whether all PV-containing basket cells have myelinated axons. Considering the functional and morphological heterogeneity of PV basket cells (<a href=\"#bib65\">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib118\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Li and Huntsman, 2014</a>), it is possible that some subtypes preferentially form myelinated axons."

The majority of myelinated inhibitory axons in our study contact dendritic shafts (53%) and spines (32%), and only 13% of the targets are cell bodies. These proportions are similar to those found in a study in rat frontal cortex of four individually filled fast-spiking basket cells, which made on average 53% of synapses onto dendritic shafts, 29% onto spines, and 18% onto cell bodies (<a href=\"#bib66\">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1998</a>). However, the four cells showed wide variability in the proportion of their somatic targets, which ranged between 4% and 35%. Studies in cat neocortex also reveal a wide variability between individual basket cells (between 20% and 69% of synapses targeting somata) (<a href=\"#bib110\">Somogyi et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Kisvarday et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib112\">Tam\u00e1s et al., 1997</a>). These findings in neocortex contrast with measurements in hippocampus, where more than 50% of the synaptic targets of PV basket cells are cell bodies, and dendritic spines are only occasionally targeted (<a href=\"#bib108\">Seress and Ribak, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Guly\u00e1s et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Halasy et al., 1996</a>).

This variability is consistent with a recent study in mouse visual cortex which found wide variation between individual animals in the fraction of synapses made onto inhibitory interneurons by layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bopp et al., 2014</a>). Overall, the anatomical literature briefly described above shows that the post-synaptic targets of a given cell type can vary widely between species, brain regions, animals, and individual neurons.

Rather, the presence of myelin may be due to the unique cellular properties and circuit functions (<a href=\"#bib59\">Hu et al., 2014</a>) of PV basket cells. Nearly all cortical PV basket cells are fast-spiking (<a href=\"#bib65\">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Gibson et al., 1999</a>), and fast-spiking neurons have very high tonic activity compared to other cell types in cortex (<a href=\"#bib41\">Gentet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Hofer et al., 2011</a>) \u2014 they generate long trains of action potentials with very high frequency (&gt;100\u2009Hz) (<a href=\"#bib65\">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Gibson et al., 1999</a>). Fast-spiking cells exhibit a number of biophysical specializations that enable high firing rates but incur an increased energy cost per action potential (<a href=\"#bib60\">Hu and Jonas, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Carter and Bean, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Hasenstaub et al., 2010</a>). Axonal myelination could help with these high energy demands in two ways: first, myelin is known to improve the energy efficiency of action potential propagation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Hartline and Colman, 2007</a>). Secondly, myelin can provide metabolic support to the axon by supplying lactate as an energy source (<a href=\"#bib104\">Rinholm et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">F\u00fcnfschilling et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Morrison et al., 2013</a>). Thus, myelin could reduce the basket cells\u2019 metabolic needs and provide an additional external energy supply from oligodendrocytes."

Could basket-cell myelin hasten the delivery of synaptic input to their postsynaptic targets to an extent that would be functionally relevant? No estimates of conduction velocities of cortical myelinated PV axons exist in the literature; however, in young (~P30) mice, PV axon conduction velocities of ~0.5\u2009m/s have been recorded (<a href=\"#bib18\">Casale et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Li et al., 2014</a>). The majority of PV axons at this age are most likely unmyelinated, since cortical myelination is not complete until much later (after P60) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barrera et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Mengler et al., 2014</a>). Using this conduction velocity estimate, an unmyelinated PV axon would conduct a spike in 0.4 ms to synapses located 200\u2009\u03bcm away, which was the typical path length from cell body to proximal synapses in our EM-based reconstructions. Thus, any reduction in the spike arrival time to proximal synapses due to myelination will inevitably be in the sub-millisecond range, likely too small a difference to affect post-synaptic dendritic integration or spike-timing-dependent plasticity, given the much slower timescales of those functions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Dan and Poo, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Feldman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</a>). However, spike time arrival differences on a sub-millisecond timescale might affect the magnitude of coordinated oscillations (<a href=\"#bib96\">Pajevic et al., 2014</a>), which are a known circuit role of basket cells."

It is possible that these dynamics may differ between the myelin wrapping inhibitory and excitatory axons. This could be due to differences arising from local interactions between oligodendrocytic processes and individual axons, or from a possible allocation of distinct oligodendrocytes (or oligodendrocyte subtypes [<a href=\"#bib116\">Tomassy et al., 2016</a>]) to axons of inhibitory or excitatory neurons (<a href=\"#bib24\">de Hoz and Simons, 2015</a>)."

It is likely that other differences in the protein or lipid content of myelin exist, considering the accumulating evidence for CNS oligodendrocyte heterogeneity (<a href=\"#bib116\">Tomassy et al., 2016</a>). Characterizing these differences as a function of neuronal type will be an important aspect of future studies."

To identify the same structures in images from both acquisition systems, DAPI fluorescence images were histogram-normalized to make the spatial structure in both the dim autofluorescence and brighter DAPI fluorescence equally apparent. This is useful because variations in the dim autofluorescence correspond to ultrastructural features visible in the electron microscope, such as large dendrites, mitochondria, and myelin. Bright DAPI fluorescence corresponds to the ultrastructurally identified heterochromatin in cell nuclei. Several corresponding features (4\u20136) in the DAPI images and the EM images were used to fit a similarity transformation (rigid rotation plus uniform scaling). This transformation was automatically applied to the other light microscopy images. Our image reconstruction tools are all available at smithlabsoftware.googlecode.com."

Most volumes comprised of approximately 60 serial sections (range of 43 to 81 sections) and included all cortical layers. For each layer, a field of view of approximately 135 by 130\u2009\u03bcm was analyzed. Immunofluorescence measurements were performed on raw images using FIJI. MBP immunofluorescence was used to define regions of interest (ROI), which were either the myelin sheath for measurements of MBP and PLP signal, or the axon under the myelin sheath for measurement of axonal immunofluorescence for GABA, PV, and cytoskeletal proteins. The mean gray value of immunolabels was compared between GABA and nonGABA axons from the same coverslip, using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U Test. Axons were classified as GABA positive or PV positive based on an empirically determined threshold for each experiment, as shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The distribution of GABA immunofluorescence showed a peak of low immunofluorescence corresponding to background, followed by a clearly defined second broad peak corresponding to GABA immunopositive axons. PV immunofluorescence exhibited a less clear separation between the background and immunofluorescence peaks, however, as expected the great majority of GABA immunonegative axons were also classified as immunonegative for PV. With the thresholds set in the example of <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, only 3.1% of GABA negative axons were classified as PV positive, and 1.7% of GABA positive axons were classified as PV negative.

The images were obtained by transmission electron microscopy of serial thin sections, resulting in a ~10 TB dataset comprised of ~4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 45 nm voxels. To sample a subset of myelinated axons in the volume systematically, a section near the center of the image volume was selected, and all myelinated axon profiles were annotated in TrakEM2 with \u2018seed\u2019 points for further tracing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Myelinated profiles near the edge of the imaged area were not seeded, to reduce the probability of the axon exiting the volume without making synapses. To categorize each myelinated axon as arising from an inhibitory or excitatory neuron, each seed was manually traced into the EM volume until the axon lost its myelin sheath and formed at least two synapses. The synapses were categorized as inhibitory or excitatory depending on whether the pre- and postsynaptic densities were symmetric (equal in thickness) or asymmetric (with a thicker postsynaptic density), respectively. Occasionally, individual synapses could not be definitively characterized as symmetric or asymmetric. This occurred most often when the section plane was oblique or parallel to the plane of the synapse. In these cases, tracing was continued until sufficient additional synapses were reached to make a definitive determination of axon type. This work was performed prior to the tracers\u2019 knowledge that the array tomography work existed.

The authors show that a significant proportion of cortical myelin ensheathes axons of inhibitory neurons and that the vast majority of myelinated inhibitory axons belong to a specific interneuron subtype, the PV-positive basket cell. While early publications in cats and macaques demonstrated myelinated axons in basket cells, this study generalizes these findings to mice and provides additional quantification of postsynaptic partners, myelin distribution and composition in PV-expressing neurons. The study will be of great interest to readers in multiple disciplines and provides information relevant for future physiological studies of activity-dependent myelination and de-/re-myelination of grey matter in various neurodegenerative disorders."

The ultrathin 70 nm sections used in AT likely provide superior access to the MBP antigen in the myelin; additionally, the freeze-substitution approach to tissue preparation aids in the preservation of the antigen<sup>1,2</sup>. To further illustrate the high quality of the MBP immunofluorescence in AT, we have now added a panel to <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, showing a higher magnification view of MBP immunofluorescence, and a supplemental image stack of raw images of serial sections through mouse cortex immunostained for MBP (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

As can be seen in <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, MBP immunofluorescence around individual axons is present as a clear and uniform outline, which is consistent from section to section.

However, in the cases where a myelinated inhibitory axon was traced back to a cell body in the AT and EM data sets, we noted that the axon \u201cbecomes myelinated soon after exiting the cell body (usually within 20-50 \u03bcm)\u201d (subsection \u201cInhibitory neurons exhibit a distinct pattern of myelination\u201d), consistent with myelination commencing shortly after the axon initial segment.

Although array tomography could be used to address this topic in future studies, for example by adding an oligodendrocyte marker to visualize these cells alongside markers for myelin (MBP) and axonal type (GABA, PV), it is in our opinion a significantly different research focus from the one described in this article.

For this analysis, we identified individual axons that contained both a myelinated and a non-myelinated portion within the dataset volume. Nodes of Ranvier were excluded and only non-myelinated stretches longer than 4 \u00b5m were considered. This analysis revealed several interesting differences. First, as the reviewers suggested, there are indeed cytoskeletal differences that are related to the inhibitory vs. excitatory distinctions. Both the myelinated and the unmyelinated regions of the inhibitory axons have higher neurofilament content and lower microtubule content compared to excitatory axons. In addition, however, there are also statistically significant differences in the cytoskeletal content between the different regions of PV+ axons, where myelinated portions have higher neurofilament and lower microtubule content compared to the unmyelinated portions of the same axons. While excitatory axons show similar trends of differences in cytoskeletal composition depending on myelination, the differences are more pronounced for PV+ axons, in particular for neurofilament content."
