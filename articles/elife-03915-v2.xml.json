We found that Msi genes are rarely mutated but frequently overexpressed in human cancers and are associated with an epithelial-luminal cell state. Using ribosome profiling and RNA-seq analysis, we found that Msi proteins regulate translation of genes implicated in epithelial cell biology and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and promote an epithelial splicing pattern. Overexpression of Msi proteins inhibited the translation of Jagged1, a factor required for EMT, and repressed EMT in cell culture and in mammary gland <i>in vivo</i>. Knockdown of Msis in epithelial cancer cells promoted loss of epithelial identity. Our results show that mammalian Msi proteins contribute to an epithelial gene expression program in neural and mammary cell types."

We found that Msi genes are rarely mutated but frequently overexpressed in human cancers and are associated with an epithelial-luminal cell state. Using ribosome profiling and RNA-seq analysis, we found that Msi proteins regulate translation of genes implicated in epithelial cell biology and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and promote an epithelial splicing pattern. Overexpression of Msi proteins inhibited the translation of Jagged1, a factor required for EMT, and repressed EMT in cell culture and in mammary gland <i>in vivo</i>. Knockdown of Msis in epithelial cancer cells promoted loss of epithelial identity. Our results show that mammalian Msi proteins contribute to an epithelial gene expression program in neural and mammary cell types."

Furthermore, many of the genes normally used in epithelial cells were switched off. In comparison, artificially increasing the levels of Musashi proteins halted the movement of mesenchymal cells and led to increased levels of genes used in epithelial cells, as if they were reverting to epithelial cells. Therefore, it appears that the Musashi proteins prevent epithelial cells from developing mesenchymal properties."

This affects how often these proteins can be made from the RNA molecules.

The Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is one such transition, which is essential in development and is thought to be co-opted by tumor cells undergoing metastasis (<a href=\"#bib34\">Polyak and Weinberg, 2009</a>). Much work on cell state transitions in both the stem cell and cancer biology fields has focused on the roles that transcription factors play in driving these transitions (<a href=\"#bib34\">Polyak and Weinberg, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lee and Young, 2013</a>), such as the induction of EMT by ectopic expression of the transcription factors Snail, Slug, or Twist (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mani et al., 2008</a>)."

The epithelial specific regulatory protein (ESRP) family of RBPs are RNA splicing factors with epithelial tissue-specific expression whose ectopic expression can partially reverse EMT (<a href=\"#bib46\">Warzecha et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shapiro et al., 2011</a>). RBPs have also been implicated in other cell state transitions, such as reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which have the essential characteristics of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). For example, overexpression of the translational regulator and microRNA processing factor Lin28 along with three transcription factors is sufficient to reprogram somatic cells (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yu et al., 2007</a>). The Muscleblind-like (Mbnl) family of RBPs promote differentiation by repressing an ESC-specific alternative splicing program, and inhibition of Mbnls promotes cellular reprogramming (<a href=\"#bib10\">Han et al., 2013</a>). For ESRP, Lin28, and Mbnl proteins, the developmental or cell-type-specific expression pattern of the protein provided clues to their functions in the maintenance of epithelial, stem cell, or differentiated cell state."

To determine whether Msi genes are generally upregulated in human cancers, we analyzed RNA-Seq data from five cancer types for which matched tumor-control pairs were available. In these matched designs, a pair of RNA samples was obtained in parallel from a single patient's tumor and healthy tissue-matched biopsy, thus minimizing the contribution of individual genetic variation to expression differences. We observed that <i>Msi1</i> was upregulated in at least 40% of breast, lung, and prostate tumors, while <i>Msi2</i> was upregulated in at least 50% of breast and prostate tumors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, top). Overall, <i>Msi1</i> or <i>Msi2</i> were significantly upregulated in matched tumor-control pairs for 3 of the 5 cancer types, compared to control pairs. Kidney tumors showed the opposite expression pattern, with <i>Msi1</i> and <i>Msi2</i> downregulated in a majority of tumors and rarely upregulated, and in thyroid cancer neither <i>Msi1</i> nor <i>Msi2</i> showed a strong bias towards up- or down-regulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, top). In breast tumors, a bimodal distribution of <i>Msi1</i> expression was observed, with a roughly even split between up- and down-regulation of <i>Msi1</i>, consistent with the idea that <i>Msi1</i> upregulation might be specific to a subtype of breast tumors. The bimodality of <i>Msi1</i> expression was not seen when comparing control pairs, so is not explained by general variability in <i>Msi1</i> levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, bottom, solid vs dotted lines)."

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of matched tumor and control samples produced a nearly perfect separation of tumors from control samples, rather than clustering by patient/genome of origin (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

Expression of Fibronectin (<i>Fn1</i>), Vimentin (<i>Vim</i>), and Jagged1 (<i>Jag1</i>), which are associated with the basal/mesenchymal state (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yamamoto et al., 2013</a>), had the opposite pattern, showing strong enrichment in basal over luminal lines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right panel).

For each 6mer, the \u2018R value\u2019 was defined as the occurrence frequency in libraries derived from MSI1-bound RNAs divided by the corresponding frequency in the input RNA library, and 6mer \u2018enrichment\u2019 was defined as the maximum R value observed across all protein concentrations. The fold enrichment profiles obtained by RBNS for the top five most enriched 6mers and five randomly chosen 6mers are shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>. Enriched 6mers exhibited similar enrichment profiles across concentrations, peaking in fold enrichment at concentrations typically between 16\u201364 nM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). To summarize the binding preferences of MSI1 from RBNS, we aligned the most enriched 6mers to generate a motif, which emphasizes that MSI1 binds predominantly to UAG-containing sequences, preferentially flanked by Us (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The MSI1 binding site (G/A)UAGU from a previous SELEX study was \u223cthreefold enriched by RBNS, along with highly similar sequences, confirming binding under our assay conditions (<a href=\"#bib12\">Imai et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ray et al., 2013</a>).

The high similarity between MSI1 and MSI2 proteins (over 70% identity at the amino acid level, with highly similar RNA recognition motifs) suggests similarity in function, and we confirmed that <i>Msi2</i> overexpression also repressed JAG1 protein expression by Western analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>).

The natural variation in Msi levels across breast cancer cell lines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>) enabled a comparison of splicing patterns between Msi-high (luminal) vs Msi-low (basal) cells. To compare mouse and human splicing patterns, we identified human alternative exon trios orthologous to mouse alternative and flanking exon trios using synteny in a multi-genome alignment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and Supp. \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We first compared changes (\u0394\u03a8) in the percent spliced in (PSI or \u03a8) values of mouse exons between <i>Msi1</i> overexpressing cells vs controls, to \u0394\u03a8 values of orthologous exons between luminal and basal breast cancer cell lines (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The splicing patterns were consistent: the human orthologs of exons up-regulated in Msi1-OE NSCs had higher inclusion in luminal (Msi-high) than in basal (Msi-low) cell lines, and similarly for down-regulated exons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Such agreement was observed for several different luminal and basal pairs, but was strongest when comparing HER2+ luminal lines such as BT474 and SKBR3 to basal lines, consistent with the higher Msi levels observed in HER2+ cell lines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

We showed that in breast cancer cells, knockdown of Msi genes leads to loss of epithelial identity and upregulation of mesenchymal markers, while their ectopic activation promotes the epithelial state and suppresses mesenchymal properties such as cell migration. As in cancer cells, overexpression of <i>Msi2</i> in healthy mammary gland tissue suppressed EMT and resulted in a defective mammary ductal branching pattern. These observations all support a role for Msi proteins in maintenance of a luminal/epithelial cell state and inhibition of EMT (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

The upregulation of <i>Jag1</i> in the basal state suggests that Notch pathway activity is high in and required for the entry into the mesenchymal state, consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zavadil et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dickson et al., 2007</a>). In mammary epithelial cells, <i>Jag1</i>-triggered activation of Notch was shown to reduce E-cadherin expression and increase Slug expression (<a href=\"#bib22\">Leong et al., 2007</a>). Furthermore, <i>Jag1</i> activation in breast cancer cells promotes their metastasis into the bone in vivo by activating Notch in neighboring bone cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sethi et al., 2011</a>). The dependence of EMT on Notch activation has been observed in normal development as well. During heart development, cardiac valves are generated from endocardium through EMT, and Notch activity was shown to be required for this process (<a href=\"#bib42\">Timmerman et al., 2004</a>).

Our study shows that post-transcriptional regulatory factors like Msi proteins can impact both translation and pre-mRNA splicing, utilizing multiple layers of RNA regulation to reshape the transcriptome for a particular cell state. Many of the impacted splicing events are part of an epithelial splicing program, suggesting that effects of Msis on splicing may reinforce the effects of <i>Jag1</i> repression on maintenance of epithelial cell state. The predominantly cytoplasmic expression of Msis makes it likely that splicing is affected indirectly, e.g., through translational regulation of specific splicing factors, though our data do not rule out that a small fraction of Msi protein may be nuclear localized and could directly regulate splicing. We have also observed that other RBPs are also enriched in the epithelial state (<a href=\"#bib39\">Shapiro et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that RBPs as a group may play a broad role in maintenance of this state, and might provide attractive targets for therapeutic efforts to manipulate cell state."

Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis, but further study of Msi in multiple stem cell compartments will be needed to directly test it. The role of Msi in the normal development and transformation of other adult tissues will also be important to understand. For example, our observation that Msi is frequently overexpressed in lung tumors suggests that ectopic expression of Msi proteins in the lung could elucidate their role in lung cancer. Furthermore, the systematic downregulation of <i>Msi1/Msi2</i> and high frequency of <i>Msi1</i> mutations in kidney tumors suggests that kidney would be an informative model for studying Msi loss-of-function and its consequences in cancer."

Mice of the 129SvJae strain were used, and the K14-rtTA strain was obtained from JAX (stock number: 007678). Animal care was in accordance with institutional guidelines and approved by the Committee on Animal Care, Department of Comparative Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, under animal protocol 1013-088-16. For derivation of embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs), littermate embryos were used whenever possible. Cortical NSCs were derived from embryos following <a href=\"#bib18\">Kim et al. (2003)</a>. Briefly, cortical tissue was isolated from E12.5 embryos (unless otherwise noted) under a light dissection microscope inside a sterile fume hood and collected by centrifugation. Cortical tissues were dissociated into single cells by trituration in Magnesium/Calcium-free HBSS buffer (Gibco, Woburn MA) followed by 15-min incubation at room temperature. Dissociated tissue was collected by centrifugation, resuspended in N2 medium containing growth factors and Laminin (Life Technologies, Woburn MA, Catalog Number: 23017015) and plated onto Polyornithin/Laminin-coated tissue culture dishes as in <a href=\"#bib29\">Okabe et al.

Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation and lysates were treated with RNase I (NEB) for 75 min at room temperature to generate monosome-protected RNA fragments. Monosomes were collected by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose cushion, denatured in 8 M Guanidium HCl, and protected RNA fragments (footprints) were extracted with Phenol\u2013Chloroform. Footprints were dephosphorylated by PNK treatment and size-selected (\u223c31\u201335 nt fragments) by purification from a 15% TBE-Urea gel. Subtractive hybridization of ribosomal RNA from footprints was performed as in (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Footprints were then polyA-tailed, and Illumina sequencing adaptors were added in a reverse transcription step to obtain footprint cDNA, which was then isolated by gel purification. cDNA was then circularized, PCR-amplified, and PCR products isolated by gel purification and submitted for sequencing on Illumina Hi-Seq platform."

Half of the extracted RNA from each condition was reverse transcribed into cDNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions using the RBNS RT primer. To control for any nucleotide biases in the input random library, 0.5 pmol of the RBNS input RNA pool was also reverse transcribed and Illumina sequencing library prep followed by 8\u201310 cycles of PCR using High Fidelity Phusion (NEB). As Msi1 concentration was increased, decreasing input RT reaction was required in the PCR. For instance, the highest MSI1 condition required 30-fold less input RT product than the no MSI1 condition. All libraries were barcoded in the PCR step, pooled together, and sequenced one HiSeq 2000 lane."

The authors initially analyze tumour and normal tissue RNA-Seq data from the Cancer Genomic Atlas repository, as well as from cancer cell lines, to document changes between Msi expression and specific cancer/normal cell types. Ribosome profiling and RNA-sequencing analyses are then used to identify Msi mRNA targets. The results suggest that Msi functions in establishing epithelial status. An important finding is that Msi proteins inhibit the translation of the Notch ligand Jag, which plays an important role in EMT. An indirect role for Msi proteins in alternative splicing is also suggested. The data supporting the first set of observations and associated conclusions in the manuscript are extensive, well presented, and backed by statistical analyses. The second part of the manuscript documents cellular phenotypes associated with altered expression of Msi. While these data are less quantitative, overall they are consistent with the view that Msi contributes to establishing and maintaining the epithelial state in both cancerous and normal developmental contexts."

The relationship between Msi expression and cancer is complex, as expression levels for these factors display increases and decreases within the same type of cancer, between different cancers, and there are also substantial differences between Msi1 and Msi2 expression. Given that tumors are typically highly heterogeneous and that epithelial tumor tissues are often contaminated with surrounding normal stromal/mesenchymal cells, do the above variations reflect this heterogeneity? While the subsequent analysis of cell lines partially addresses this issue, the authors should at least discuss that levels of Msi in tumour tissues may be more reflective of epithelial content than cancerous state."

It is possible that co-factors are required in vivo for Msi to affect translation following binding to the mRNA, or that other RNA-binding factors outcompete Msi protein for binding.

Our new data (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) show that epithelial markers are generally downregulated while mesenchymal markers are upregulated upon knockdown of Msis in an epithelial cancer cell line. To further solidify this connection, we overexpressed Msi1 in a mesenchymal cell line (MDAMB231) where Msi1 levels were initially extremely low. We found that Msi1 overexpression led to a decrease in mesenchymal markers and an increase in epithelial markers, consistent with our model that Msi proteins promote an epithelial state. To address reviewer comments regarding cell migration, we performed a migration transwell assay in breast cancer cell lines. We found that overexpression of Msi1 in the mesenchymal cell line LM2 (a derivative of MDAMB231) strongly impaired migration in the transwell assay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). These migration assays are more quantitative and controlled than the scratch assay we performed previously, and we feel that the use of breast cancer cell lines for migration analysis is particularly relevant, given the roles for EMT in breast cancer."

While we have linked Musashi proteins to regulation of the epithelial state and EMT in cancer (through functional analysis of cancer cell lines and computational analysis of TCGA data), and in normal development (through in vivo analyses of healthy mammary gland development), we do not directly address metastasis in this work. We have been careful not to imply in the text that our work bears directly on metastasis, or that the role of Musashi proteins in cancer occurs through their effect on metastatic processes. We believe that our results on the regulation of the epithelial state (and of EMT in a healthy mammary gland context) have consequences that are significant independent of possible effects on metastasis, and may not directly bear on metastasis. In some cancers like glioblastoma, where Msis are highly expressed, metastases are rare. In breast cancer, highly proliferative epithelial tumors (like Luminal B type tumors) can be aggressive and harmful to patients without possessing the mesenchymal properties that lead to metastases. Therefore, we feel that potential links to metastasis are very worthwhile to explore, but are not essential to the conclusions of this paper."
