Genomics 44, 853\u2013863), we noticed a significant effect of the vehicle for DLPC (a 4:1 mixture of PEG-400 and Tween-80 delivered to mice by oral gavage twice daily) on gene expression. Genes most affected were generally those already induced strongly by tunicamycin. We did not detect this vehicle effect in previous experiments not utilizing ER stressors, indicating that this vehicle may behave unexpectedly in the context of ER stress. Unfortunately, this confounds the normalization and statistical assessment of the vehicle and vehicle + DLPC components of the dataset and we have therefore removed these data from Table 1 in our manuscript and from GSE68718. We did not observe similar effects of the vehicle (DMSO) for the LRH-1 agonist RJW100 on ER stress-induced gene expression in primary hepatocytes. Therefore, this correction does not conflict with our previous conclusions that LRH-1 agonism results in the induction of LRH-1 and ATF-2 target genes and promotes cell survival during ER stress. An outside analysis of the main microarray data presented in this paper (Table 1 excluding DLPC data and Figure 4) found the conclusions drawn to be accurate."
