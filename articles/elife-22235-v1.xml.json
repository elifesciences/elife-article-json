It remains unclear how apical constriction is regulated spatiotemporally during tissue invagination and how this cellular process contributes to tube formation in different developmental contexts. Using <i>Drosophila</i> salivary gland (SG) invagination as a model, we show that regulation of <i>folded gastrulation</i> expression by the Fork head transcription factor is required for apicomedial accumulation of Rho kinase and non-muscle myosin II, which coordinate apical constriction. We demonstrate that neither loss of spatially coordinated apical constriction nor its complete blockage prevent internalization and tube formation, although such manipulations affect the geometry of invagination. When apical constriction is disrupted, compressing force generated by a tissue-level myosin cable contributes to SG invagination. We demonstrate that fully elongated polarized SGs can form outside the embryo, suggesting that tube formation and elongation are intrinsic properties of the SG."

Further examination showed that proteins (called Fork Head and Fog) activate and localize an enzyme (Rho kinase) to control the localized accumulation of myosin II and thereby control apical constriction. Chung et al. then showed that salivary glands could still form tubes if apical constriction was blocked, indicating that it is not an essential part of tissue invagination in this organ. However, blocking apical constriction led the tube to develop unusual shapes at intermediate stages."

Particularly, a pulsatile actomyosin complex in the apical medial region of the cell (hereafter referred to as apicomedial myosin) has been described in tissues that undergo apical constriction (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blanchard et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Martin et al., 2009</a>). Studies in early <i>Drosophila</i> embryos have identified the Folded gastrulation (Fog) pathway that regulates apical constriction and apicomedial myosin formation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Manning and Rogers, 2014</a>). During gastrulation, mesodermal cells undergo apical constriction to form the ventral furrow along the anterior/posterior body axis. In those cells, the mesoderm-specific transcription factors Twist and Snail activate G protein-coupled receptor signaling and recruit RhoGEF2 to the apical surface, which, in turn, activates Rho1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Costa et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">K\u00f6lsch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Manning et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Parks and Wieschaus, 1991</a>). GTP-bound Rho1 then activates Rho-associated kinase (Rok), which phosphorylates and activates non-muscle myosin II, which forms an actomyosin complex at the medial apical cortex (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dawes-Hoang et al., 2005</a>). This actomyosin complex causes asynchronous contractions that pull the adherens junctions (AJs) inward. Contractions are maintained between pulses by the actomyosin belt, which serves as a \u2018ratchet\u2019 to incrementally reduce apical area (<a href=\"#bib42\">Martin et al., 2009</a>)."

In <i>Drosophila</i> trachea defective for EGF receptor signaling, apical constriction is impaired, but most cells invaginate (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brodu and Casanova, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nishimura et al., 2007</a>). Similarly, in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos mutant for <i>twist</i> or <i>fog</i>, mesodermal cells with defective apical constriction still invaginate, although the process is both delayed and aberrant (<a href=\"#bib34\">Leptin and Grunewald, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sweeton et al., 1991</a>). In these mutants, however, apical constriction is not completely blocked; it is simply less extensive and more random (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brodu and Casanova, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Costa et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nishimura et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sweeton et al., 1991</a>), making it difficult to draw any clear conclusions. A recent study, using an optogenetic method to deplete phosphatidylinositol-4,5 bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) and actin from the cell cortex, showed that local inhibition of apical constriction is sufficient to cause global arrest of mesoderm invagination during <i>Drosophila</i> gastrulation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Guglielmi et al., 2015</a>). This finding suggests that apical constriction is essential for the invagination by wrapping that occurs during ventral furrow formation. It remains unclear, however, whether apical constriction is also critical for tissue invagination by budding."

The SG begins as a two-dimensional sheet of cells on the embryo surface that internalizes to form an elongated tube (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chung et al., 2014</a>). Since neither cell division nor cell death occurs once the SG has been specified, the entire morphogenetic process must be driven by changes in cell shape and rearrangement. Indeed, apical constriction has been observed in this tissue (<a href=\"#bib47\">Myat and Andrew, 2000a</a>), and an increase in apical myosin has been reported during SG invagination (<a href=\"#bib16\">Escudero et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nikolaidou and Barrett, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Xu et al., 2008</a>). More detailed analyses revealed several distinct myosin structures in the forming SG, including a supracellular myosin cable that surrounds the entire tissue and is thought to be involved in tissue invagination, as well as a web-like myosin structure in the apicomedial region of cells that colocalizes with actin (<a href=\"#bib58\">R\u00f6per, 2012</a>). The latter shows pulsatile behavior, suggesting that contractile forces by the apicomedial actomyosin complex may drive apical constriction during SG invagination (<a href=\"#bib10\">Booth et al., 2014</a>)."

We show that the spatial and temporal pattern of apical constriction correlates with apicomedial myosin formation during SG invagination. We uncover the molecular pathway through which the FoxA transcription factor Fork head (Fkh) coordinates apical constriction by regulating Fog signaling in the SGs. Through genetic manipulations to completely block apical constriction and detailed quantitative analysis, we show that apical constriction is not required for SG invagination, but is required for proper tissue geometry. SG cells can internalize even without forming apicomedial myosin, suggesting a role for other additional forces. We provide evidence that the compressing force generated by the tissue-level supracellular myosin cable contributes to invagination in SGs with defective apical constriction. By analyzing the externalized SG phenotypes of <i>fog</i> mutants, we also reveal that tube formation can be decoupled from tissue invagination."

Using labeling with E-Cadherin (E-Cad), an AJ marker, and CrebA, an SG nuclear marker, we segmented apical cell outlines and calculated the apical area of individual cells. By analyzing\u00a0&gt;60 WT SGs for apical area and depth of invagination, we classified four distinct stages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013G, D'\u2013G'</a>). At early stage 11, all SG cells were on the embryo surface and cells with different apical area were distributed relatively randomly, although cells with small and large apical area tended to be toward the inside and at the periphery of the tissue, respectively (Before invagination; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D and D\u2019</a>). Shortly after, subsets of cells clustered in specific regions had smaller apical areas, most notably in a middle region close to the posterior edge of the SG where invagination begins (Clustered apical constriction; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E and E\u2019</a>). The less prominent anterior cluster corresponds to a small indentation that can be observed in lateral views of stage 12 SGs (data not shown). When a few cells in the posterior cluster had internalized to form an invagination pit, many cells near the pit were apically constricted (Beginning of invagination; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F and F\u2019</a>). At late stage 11, as more cells had invaginated, most cells anterior to the invagination pit were apically constricted (Deep invagination; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G and G\u2019</a>). At the same time, cells in the periphery of the SG were apically expanded, especially in the region ventral to the invagination pit. Quantification of the percentage and cumulative percentage of cells of different apical area showed a gradual and significant increase in the number of cells with smaller apical area as invagination progressed. Small increases in the number of cells with larger apical area were also observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I and J</a>)."

SGs of <i>H99</i> deficiency embryos develop completely normally during embryogenesis, indicating that blocking apoptosis does not affect SG morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib47\">Myat and Andrew, 2000a</a>). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal images of the late stage 11 <i>fkh H99</i> SGs did not reveal invagination pits (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2019\u2019 and C\u2019\u2019</a>), consistent with a complete failure of invagination. Analysis of apical areas of late stage 11 <i>fkh H99</i> SGs revealed that <i>fkh H99</i> SG cells had overall smaller apical area than WT cells; both the mean and median values for apical area were lower than those of WT (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Importantly, cells with the smallest apical areas were not clustered in <i>fkh H99</i> mutant SGs and were instead randomly distributed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H and H\u2019</a>). Moreover, the cumulative percentage of late stage 11 <i>fkh H99</i> SG cells of different apical areas showed a similar distribution trend to that of WT SG cells before invagination (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). Indeed, median scaling normalization of the apical area of <i>fkh H99</i> late stage 11 SG cells revealed a very similar distribution to the apical area of WT SGs before invagination. Particularly, the percentages of cells with the lower 70% apical area were indistinguishable (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). Taken together, our analysis reveals that apical constriction is both temporally and spatially coordinated during SG invagination and does not occur in <i>fkh H99</i> mutants."

Consistent with results from (<a href=\"#bib58\">R\u00f6per, 2012</a>), several myosin structures were observed, including a supracellular myosin cable that encircles the whole tissue, AJ-associated cortical myosin, as well as an apicomedial myosin web (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). Importantly, apicomedial myosin formed in a manner that recapitulates the observed temporal and spatial pattern of apical constriction. Before invagination, myosin predominantly localized at the cortical regions in all SG cells, partially colocalizing with E-Cad and often showing higher intensity at vertices (hereafter referred to as junctional myosin; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). When invagination began, moderate levels of apicomedial myosin were observed in cells near where invagination initiates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). During deep invagination, apicomedial myosin was quite prominent in the\u00a0cells anterior to the invagination pit (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Indeed, the measured intensity ratios of junctional to apicomedial myosin decreased over time in the WT SG cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In contrast, junctional myosin was predominant throughout stage 11 in <i>fkh H99</i> SGs, and only dispersed, weak myosin signals were observed in the apical region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Correspondingly, the ratio of junctional to apicomedial myosin in <i>fkh H99</i> SGs was comparable to that of WT before invagination (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>)."

During deep invagination, huge globular structures of Rok occupied nearly the entire apicomedial domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Live imaging revealed congregating and separating behaviors, suggesting that the large globular structures are dynamic (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Importantly, only small punctate signals were detected in the apical region of <i>fkh H99</i> SG cells throughout all of stage 11 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), indicating that Fkh is required for apicomedial Rok accumulation. In embryos treated with the Rok inhibitor Y-27632, myosin was detected only along the lateral membrane and in the basal region of the cells, suggesting that Rok activity is required for the formation of apicomedial myosin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Furthermore, the SGs of Y-27632-treated embryos did not invaginate, suggesting a critical role for Rok."

Overexpression of Crb, which expands the apical domain when overexpressed (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wodarz et al., 1995</a>), or a constitutively-active form of Diaphanous (Dia-CA; <a href=\"#bib61\">Somogyi and R\u00f8rth, 2004</a>), a fly formin protein that nucleates and facilitates the elongation of actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib23\">Higgs and Peterson, 2005</a>), from the onset of SG specification throughout development efficiently blocked apical constriction; clustered apical constriction was not observed at any stage of invagination (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013H, A\u2019\u2212H\u2019</a>). Moreover, analyses of the percentage and cumulative percentage of cells of different apical area showed that Crb or Dia-CA overexpression not only blocked apical constriction but also caused significant increase in apical area. Before invagination, Crb-overexpressing cells showed apical areas comparable to those of WT cells at early stage 11, and Dia-CA-overexpressing cells showed a small (but significant) increase of apical area (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>; <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). At the beginning of invagination, cells showed a notable increase in apical area, with obvious shifts in the distribution of apical area when compared to WT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>; <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). Importantly, the percentage of cells in different apical area bins of Crb- or Dia-CA-overexpressing SGs was comparable to that of WT SG cells before invagination, confirming that the cells do not undergo apical constriction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>; <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). During deep invagination, Dia-CA-overexpressing SG cells still have apical areas comparable to those of WT SG cells before invagination, but overexpression of Crb caused a huge increase in apical area (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>; <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). Importantly, however, neither blocking apical constriction nor increasing apical area arrested SG invagination. SGs overexpressing Crb or Dia-CA formed invagination pits without any delays. Plotting of cells of lower 10%, 20% and 30% of apical area showed that cells with smaller apical area were not as clustered as in WT, with significantly increased dispersion along the anterior/posterior (A/P) axis of the tissue (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>). These data indicate that overexpression of Crb or Dia-CA effectively blocks apical constriction and alters the distribution of cells with smaller apical areas."

Even during deep invagination, Rok signals were detected only as small- to medium-sized puncta (in Crb-overexpressing SG cells; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>) or as very small puncta (in Dia-CA-overexpressing SG cells; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L</a>) rather than the huge globular structures detected in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). However, Crb-overexpressing SGs formed relatively normal pools of apicomedial myosin that are associated with actin and with membrane distortions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a>), consistent with our findings that in <i>fog</i> mutants even dispersed Rok can still result in some apicomedial myosin formation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F and G</a>). These data suggest that in Crb-overexpressing SG cells, the forces of apical expansion overwhelm those of apical constriction despite the actomyosin machinery being in place and functional. Interestingly, in Dia-CA-overexpressing SG cells, most myosin signals were observed in a broad cortical area partially overlapping with actin, but no web-like apicomedial myosin formed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5M</a>; compare to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). A\u00a0similar increase in cortical myosin was observed in Dia-CA-overexpressing amnioserosa cells, but interestingly, premature apical constriction was observed in those cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Homem and Peifer, 2008</a>), suggesting possible tissue-specific effects. Moreover, the significant \u2018wiggliness\u2019 of the AJs in Dia-CA-overexpressing SGs suggests a decrease of cortical tension (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E, G, H and L</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Blanchard et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Choi et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Martin et al., 2009</a>). Overall, since SG invagination occurs despite the failure in apical constriction with overexpression of either Crb or Dia-CA, we conclude that apical constriction is not required."

Specifically, both the <i>fog</i> mutant and Crb-overexpressing SGs frequently formed a pit that was elongated along the D/V axis, rather than the smaller oval-shaped pit of WT SGs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C, A'\u2013C'</a>). Overexpression of Dia-CA resulted in a huge invagination pit, often larger than half the size of the tissue (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D and D'</a>). We asked how this aberrant invagination and the continuous increases in apical area affected tube structure. 3D reconstruction of invaginating SGs (late stage 11) revealed a wider lumen in <i>fog</i> mutant and Crb- and Dia-CA-overexpressing SGs compared to WT, indicating that early tube architecture is affected by defective apical constriction and consequent abnormal invagination (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u20136H</a>). We next analyzed stage 14 embryos, when in WT, all SG cells have fully internalized (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). Interestingly, Dia-CA-overexpressing SGs showed a significant delay in cell internalization and migration. All Dia-CA-overexpressing cells eventually internalized, but formed a short gland with increased luminal diameter that remained close to the embryo surface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>). Overproduced Crb not only localized to the apical membranes, but also mislocalized to the basal membranes facing outside of the tube; nonetheless, SG cells still formed a single-layered fully internalized tube at stage 14 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K</a>). Although Crb overexpression did not delay SG internalization or migration, partially or completely externalized SGs with no clear internal lumen were occasionally observed at stage 15 and 16 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L</a>). Since all SGs were internalized at earlier stages, these findings suggest that the Crb-overexpressing SG cells subsequently evaginated from the inside to the outside of the embryo, likely because of continued apical expansion. Similar invagination-followed-by-evagination phenotypes were observed when a myristoylated, membrane-tethered form of Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome protein (Myr-Wasp), an activator of the actin nucleating Arp2/3 complex, was overexpressed in the SGs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6M</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Overall, these data suggest that the major role of apical constriction is to ensure the proper tissue geometry during SG invagination."

Given that loss of <i>fog</i> had relatively minor effects on apical constriction compared to overexpression of Crb or Dia-CA, and that <i>fog</i> mutants also form the circumferential cable surrounding the tissue, these severe tube internalization defects were unexpected. Therefore, we asked if SG expression of Fog in otherwise <i>fog</i> mutant embryos could rescue internalization using the UAS-Gal4 system, which has allowed the\u00a0rescue of multiple SG mutant phenotypes, including loss of <i>fkh</i> and other transcription factors expressed in the early SG (D. Johnson and D.J. Andrew, unpublished data). The range of defects observed with SG expression of Fog in otherwise <i>fog</i> mutant embryos was similar to that seen with complete loss of <i>fog</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K</a>), indicating that the Fog requirement for internalization is not SG autonomous. Instead, analysis of early <i>fog</i> mutant embryos suggested that the\u00a0separation of the SG from the surrounding epithelia causes these defects. In stage 11 <i>fog</i> mutants, deep ingression furrows often formed between the two tissues, and in more than 60% of embryos with such furrows (24/39), some SG cells at the edge were tilted and even perpendicular to the rest of the cells in the SG epithelium, forming a lip-like structure (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F\u2013J and F'\u2013J'</a>). These cells maintained adhesion to their neighbors and were properly polarized, with their AJs connected to those of neighboring SG cells at the edge. Strong myosin signals at the level of AJs along the edge of the lip (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H\u2019</a>) suggest that pulling or squeezing forces along the edge of the gland in combination with the pushing forces of the ingression furrow caused the SG cells to slip outside the embryo."

In the ventral furrow, Twist and Snail regulate expression of the Fog ligand and its receptor, respectively (<a href=\"#bib38\">Manning et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Seher et al., 2007</a>). Likewise, Caudal, through activation of additional downstream transcription factors, is required for <i>fog</i> expression in the posterior midgut (<a href=\"#bib14\">Costa et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wu and Lengyel, 1998</a>). Here, we demonstrate that Fkh regulates SG expression of <i>fog</i> to coordinate apical constriction of SG cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Therefore, at least during embryogenesis, the tissue-specificity of Fog signaling is determined by the tissue-specific transcription factor(s) that activate expression of <i>fog</i> (and its receptors). The downstream pathway components are both maternally deposited and widely expressed, and are thus likely to be shared in all cell/tissue types where Fog functions. Indeed, mutations in RhoGEF2, a key component of the Fog signaling pathway in the\u00a0mesoderm, cause SG invagination defects (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nikolaidou and Barrett, 2004</a>). Due to their ubiquitous expression, localized activation of the downstream components, rather than their localized expression, is likely to determine their site of action. Consistent with this notion, we demonstrated that the\u00a0robust apicomedial Rok accumulation in the SG cells requires both Fkh and Fog (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>)."

Levels of <i>fog</i> transcripts are relatively uniform across the primordia, yet both Rok accumulation and apicomedial myosin accumulation occur only in a temporally and spatially regulated subset of SG cells. We propose that production and apical release of Fog and/or the apical localization of its transmembrane receptors could be regulated post-translationally. Excellent candidate regulators include Huckebein (Hkb), an SP1-like transcription factor, and its key target Klarsicht (Klar), a putative regulator of dynein ATPase (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Myat and Andrew, 2000b</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2002</a>). The expression of both <i>hkb</i> and <i>klar</i> is limited to the dorsal posterior domain of the SG, where we observe high Rok, high myosin, and apical constriction. Since Klar is required for the delivery of vesicles to the apical SG surface, which is enriched in minus-end microtubules (MT) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Myat and Andrew, 2002</a>), a possible scenario is that during invagination, Klar-dependent apically-targeted vesicles contain Fog ligand and/or its receptor. Consistent with this model, a recent study has demonstrated a requirement for the MT cytoskeleton in the formation of apicomedial myosin (<a href=\"#bib10\">Booth et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, unlike WT, <i>hkb</i> mutant SGs invaginate from the center of the SG placode (<a href=\"#bib49\">Myat and Andrew, 2002</a>)."

Indeed, ventral furrow cells invaginate without changing their position relative to each other; cells constrict predominantly in the ventral/lateral direction, remaining longer along the A/P axis to form a long, narrow furrow along the axis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Martin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sweeton et al., 1991</a>)."

In the SG, where cells sequentially invaginate through a relatively small invagination pit to make a tube, combinatorial forces that drive different morphological changes are expected to contribute to tissue invagination (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8L</a>). Correspondingly, in tracheal invagination, at least three independent processes have been implicated: EGF-dependent myosin accumulation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brodu and Casanova, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nishimura et al., 2007</a>), an oriented final cell division (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</a>), and FGF-mediated migratory forces. Only when all three processes are disrupted, do tracheal cells fail to internalize (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</a>). However, since no cell divisions occur once the SG has been specified (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chung et al., 2014</a>), oriented cell divisions cannot contribute. Similarly, our finding that the non-autonomous functions of <i>fog</i> can lead to fully formed external SGs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) reduces the likelihood that signaling between the SG and neighboring tissues is critical."

This circumferential myosin cable forms normally in both <i>fog</i> mutant SGs and in Crb-overexpressing SGs, where invagination occurs relatively normally, but fails to form in <i>fkh</i> mutant SGs and in Dia-overexpressing SGs, where invagination either fails or is delayed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). These findings support the idea that tension generated by the myosin cable contributes to and facilitates invagination (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This closing process in the SG is reminiscent of the \u2018purse-strings\u2019 observed during wound healing in both flies and vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib43\">Martin and Parkhurst, 2004</a>) and also during <i>Drosophila</i> dorsal closure (<a href=\"#bib19\">Franke et al., 2005</a>). It is notable that multiple forces have been suggested to contribute to dorsal closure; dorsal closure fails only when both the forces of apical constriction of amnioserosa cells and of purse strings from surrounding epidermal cells are ablated (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kiehart et al., 2000</a>), although this model of a combinatorial force-component system has been challenged by recent studies showing that the epidermal actin cable tension may not contribute to dorsal closure (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pasakarnis et al., 2016</a>)."

We propose that cell rearrangement linked to junctional myosin may also be important. A strong junctional myosin pool is observed throughout SG invagination, with high levels at cell vertices (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">R\u00f6per, 2012</a>). We have direct and indirect evidence for cell rearrangement in early WT SGs from live imaging and measurements of cell topology (S. Chung, S. Kim and D.J. Andrew, unpublished data), suggesting that this process is linked to tissue invagination. Since myosin localizes in a broader cortical region in Dia-CA-overexpressing SGs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), it is possible that cell rearrangement of Dia-CA-overexpressing cells is somewhat affected, explaining the delayed invagination and abnormal tissue morphology observed early (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D and H</a>). Nonetheless, cell rearrangement must still occur in the Dia-CA overexpressing glands since they form elongated tubes with an approximately WT arrangement of cells at later stages (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>). The complete failure of invagination in <i>fkh H99</i> SGs raises the possibility of failed cell rearrangement. Interestingly, changes in cell topology occur independently of <i>fkh</i> function. WT and <i>fkh H99</i> mutant SGs show a similar distribution of n-sided cells during early stages of invagination (S. Chung and D.J. Andrew, unpublished data). Consistent with the idea that cortical enrichment of myosin has a role in these topological changes, junctional myosin is intact in <i>fkh H99</i> SGs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In any case, more direct measurements of cell rearrangement in both WT and <i>fkh</i> mutants will be necessary to learn how directed cell rearrangement contributes to SG internalization. Overall, our findings suggest that multiple forces are required for SG invagination and that the system is remarkably robust. Importantly, our finding that polarized and fully elongated tubes can form outside the embryo indicates that SG morphogenesis is largely a tissue-autonomous process."

The ventral midline of the embryo was used as the ventral boundary of the traced circle in all cases. For <i>fog</i> mutants, only\u00a0circularity of the SG boundary and inner boundary was measured, since the cells in the neighboring epithelia were often out of the focal plane due to the twisted phenotype of the embryos. Circularity was calculated based on the fact that for a perfect circle the circularity C\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0=\u00a04 \u03c0 area/perimeter<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lawrence et al., 1999</a>). Circularity values were plotted in Prism and statistical significance in differences in the\u00a0circularity of outer and inner boundaries compared to the\u00a0circularity of the cable was analyzed using a\u00a0two-tailed t test."

The last six years have seen a revolution in our thinking about the mechanisms by which apical constriction is driven, based in large part on studies of the <i>Drosophila</i> invaginating mesoderm. This has revealed a novel and unexpected role for an apical myosin network created in response to cell-cell signaling and regulated by apical Rok. However, the generality of this model, in particular in invaginating tubular organs, has remained unexamined. Here Chung et al. present a stunning examination of this, using the extremely tractable <i>Drosophila</i> salivary gland as a model. In a series of experiments combining sophisticated genetic tools, beautiful imaging and extensive quantitative analysis, they lay out a pathway leading from the transcription factor Fkh through the cell signaling molecule Fog to Rok and myosin. They also find some exceptionally surprising things along the way-most particularly that the system is remarkably robust, such that eliminating apical construction does not block organ invagination. I think these results will be of very broad interested to both cell and developmental biologists."
