While the alpha-crystallin domain (ACD) dimer of sHSPs is the universal building block, how the ACD transmits structural changes in response to stress to promote holdase activity is unknown. We found that the dimer interface of HSPB5 is destabilized over physiological pHs and a conserved histidine (His-104) controls interface stability and oligomer structure in response to acidosis. Destabilization by pH or His-104 mutation shifts the ACD from dimer to monomer but also results in a large expansion of HSPB5 oligomer states. Remarkably, His-104 mutant-destabilized oligomers are efficient holdases that reorganize into structurally distinct client\u2013bound complexes. Our data support a model for sHSP function wherein cell stress triggers small perturbations that alter the ACD building blocks to unleash a cryptic mode of chaperone action."

While the alpha-crystallin domain (ACD) dimer of sHSPs is the universal building block, how the ACD transmits structural changes in response to stress to promote holdase activity is unknown. We found that the dimer interface of HSPB5 is destabilized over physiological pHs and a conserved histidine (His-104) controls interface stability and oligomer structure in response to acidosis. Destabilization by pH or His-104 mutation shifts the ACD from dimer to monomer but also results in a large expansion of HSPB5 oligomer states. Remarkably, His-104 mutant-destabilized oligomers are efficient holdases that reorganize into structurally distinct client\u2013bound complexes. Our data support a model for sHSP function wherein cell stress triggers small perturbations that alter the ACD building blocks to unleash a cryptic mode of chaperone action."

From this, Rajagopal et al. propose a model to explain how cellular stress triggers small changes in HSPB5 that propagate through the chaperone in a response mechanism that increases its activity. Future studies will investigate whether inherited mutations in HSPB5 and other similar chaperones\u2014which are associated with cardiac, muscle, and nerve disorders\u2014exert their effect by disrupting this response mechanism."

Ineffective resolution of protein misfolding and unmitigated protein aggregation can lead to formation of plaques, fibrils, and other aggregated species encountered in neurodegenerative diseases. Generally, ATP-dependent chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 assist with protein refolding, while ATP-independent chaperones known as small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) act as first responders by maintaining proteins in soluble forms to inhibit misfolding and to delay aggregation. Under transcriptional regulation of the heat shock factor, Hsf1, levels of sHSPs can rise to 1% of total cellular protein when conditions deviate from the norm, e.g. ischemia, hypoxia, oncogene activation, and chemotherapy (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kampinga and Garrido, 2012</a>). sHSPs are found throughout prokaryotes and eukaryotes. There are ten sHSPs encoded in the human genome (HSPB1, HSPB2, etc), ranging in size from 15 to 25 kDa. Most, including the ubiquitously expressed human sHSP HSPB5, form large assemblies that exist as dynamic distributions of polydisperse oligomers whose properties are both temperature and pH dependent (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jehle et al., 2011</a>). Which form or forms of an sHSP are active and how they function are central unanswered questions. In addition, how sHSPs interact with partly unfolded or aggregate-prone proteins (\u2018clients\u2019) to prevent formation of aggregates remains enigmatic."

A decrease in cellular pH may give rise to destabilization of some proteins and/or a decrease in solubility for proteins with pI values between pH 6 and 7. Furthermore, the pH in normal eye lens fiber cells, which contain extremely high concentrations of the sHSPs HSPB4 and HSPB5 is \u223c6.5 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bassnett and Duncan, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Mathias et al., 1991</a>).

Like all sHSPs, HSPB5 has a conserved central \u03b1-crystallin domain (ACD) flanked by variable N- and C-terminal regions. We carried out investigations both on the HSPB5-ACD, which forms the dimeric building block found in all sHSPs, and on full-length oligomeric HSPB5. We find that ACD dimer stability decreases over a narrow physiologically relevant pH range and we have identified a conserved histidine residue that is largely responsible for the observed destabilization. Surprisingly, the histidine is not on the dimer interface but its mutation to glutamine or lysine partly or fully recapitulates low pH behavior both in the context of the ACD dimer and in oligomers. The mutant proteins allowed us to probe the consequences of dimer interface destabilization without additional complicating factors that arise when comparing experiments performed at differing pH. Mutations that destabilize the dimer interface produce extremely large oligomers that can rearrange to form long-lived complexes with a model client protein. Our studies unmask a cryptic mode of HSPB5/client interaction not previously detected using the wild-type protein under non-stress conditions. The results highlight mechanistic differences in the ways in which holdases work and suggest that HSPB5 has a repertoire of ways in which it can carry out its function."

Although multiple structures have been solved for HSPB5-ACD, there are differences among them as well as differences in the conditions under which the structures were obtained (i.e., pH 4.6, 6.0, 7.5, 8.5, 9.0) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 2011</a>). We felt this situation necessitated structure determination under solution conditions relevant to our studies. The solution structure of HSPB5-ACD at pH 7.5, 22\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) was calculated from NMR data that included backbone and side chain chemical shifts, NOEs, and RDCs (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). As in all previously determined HSPB5-ACD dimer structures (PDB 2WJ7, 3L1G, 2KLR, 2Y22, 4M5S, and 4M5T), each subunit adopts a six-stranded \u03b2-sandwich structure and two ACDs form a dimer through anti-parallel alignment of their long \u03b26+7 strands (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B,C</a>). A notable difference among solved sHSP ACD structures is that dimers appear in different alignments of the two \u03b26+7 strands (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hochberg et al., 2014</a>). In the solution structure reported here, the dimer interface places Glu117 across from Glu117\u2032 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This register is observed in all but two of the available HSPB5-ACD structures and is also the predominant alignment observed in other metazoan sHSP ACD structures."

Two NMR ensembles (solution-state reported here and solid-state PDB 2KLR) and five crystal structures all overlay well with the exception of the loop that connects \u03b25 and \u03b26+7 (called Loop 5/6; residues His-104\u2013Gly-112). Loop 5/6 curves upwards in our solution ensemble (pH 7.5) and in three crystal structures (2WJ7 [pH 9.0], 3L1G [pH 4.6], and 2Y22 [pH 8.6]). In the \u2018loop up\u2019 conformation, Loop 5/6 residues make contacts across the dimer interface to the other subunit. In contrast, Loop 5/6 curves slightly downwards in the solid-state NMR ensemble (2KLR; pH 7.5) and in two crystal structures (4M5S [pH 6.0]; 4M5T [pH 6.5]). Thus, among structures solved between pH 6.5 and 7.5, both loop conformations have been observed, suggesting that the loop is dynamic in the physiological pH range."

A majority of backbone amide nitrogens have <sup>15</sup>N T<sub>2</sub> values between 30 and 40 ms, but resonances in Loop 5/6 and the dimer interface have T<sub>2</sub> &lt; 30 ms, indicating they undergo a change in their environment in the millisecond timescale (data not shown). To better probe this time regime, we performed NMR <sup>15</sup>N relaxation-compensated CPMG relaxation dispersion measurements under the solution structure conditions (700 \u03bcM ACD at pH 7.5, 22\u00b0C). Examples of relaxation curves obtained from spectra collected at two magnetic field strengths (600 and 800 MHz) are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. Twenty resonances gave curves that could be analyzed; of these, half are well fit by a two-state model (<math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><msubsup><mtext>\u03c7</mtext><mrow><mtext>red</mtext></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow></math>; reduced chi-square &lt; 10; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). This indicates that the ACD dimer is exchanging between a major species (i.e., the one revealed in the solution structure ensemble) and one or more minor species. The nature of the minor species will be discussed below. Values for <i>k</i><sub>ex</sub>, the rate of exchange, for individual resonances ranged between 760 s<sup>\u22121</sup> and 1119 s<sup>\u22121</sup>. The less than two-fold difference for the range of values obtained from fitting data for individual resonances suggests that the residues that exhibit exchange could be involved in the same dynamic phenomenon. The residues that undergo exchange are along the dimer interface and in Loop 5/6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). These findings are consistent with the apparent plasticity of the dimer interface and Loop 5/6 inferred from crystal structures of the ACD dimer. Analysis of available HSPB5-ACD structures and NMR relaxation data combined indicate that (1) the HSPB5 protomer structure is retained over a wide pH range and (2) there are two regions of plasticity, namely the dimer interface and Loop 5/6."

Furthermore, spectra collected between pH 7.0 and pH 6.0 had significant peak doubling which is mostly resolved at pH 6.0, making analysis of the pH-induced spectral changes based solely on existing resonance assignments at pH 7.5 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jehle et al., 2009</a>) challenging. Therefore, we assigned the HSPB5-ACD spectrum at pH 6.5 using standard triple resonance spectra collected at both pH 6.5 and pH 6.0 so that we could follow individual resonances through a pH titration series. An expanded region of the <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC pH series is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>. In the absence of another pH-dependent process, resonances arising from residues that undergo a protonation/deprotonation event as a function of pH will shift in a continuous manner. Resonances from residues that are proximal to titrating residues will also show similar behavior. Such processes will appear in the so-called \u2018fast-exchange\u2019 NMR regime due to the rapid on/off rate of acidic protons. At pH values above 6.7, some resonances in the HSPB5-ACD spectrum exhibit fast-exchange pH behavior, consistent with protonation/deprotonation of ionizable groups. This behavior is illustrated by the resonance for His-119 in spectra collected at pH 6.7 and above (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). At pH &lt; 6.7, some resonances double and appear in a new position (for example, resonances labeled 87, 119, and 135 in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Such behavior exemplifies intermediate-to-slow exchange and is indicative of the existence of two states that interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale. The relative intensities of the peaks reflect the relative population of the two states, so a new species of HSPB5-ACD is increasingly populated as the pH decreases."

Therefore, the rate at which subunits leave an oligomer is not determined by disruption of the ACD dimer and the results suggest that dimer interfaces within oligomers may break and reform many times during the residency of subunits within HSPB5 oligomers."

HSPB5-ACD has a high histidine content, with five His residues out of 89 total residues, (5.6%, which is more than double the average His frequency across all proteomes).

A p<i>K</i><sub>R</sub> could not be determined for His-104 because its side chain resonances broaden and disappear at pH values below 7.5. Though His-104 is not positioned on the dimer interface, the behavior of its backbone NH resonance is similar to backbone NH resonances on the dimer interface undergoing exchange between dimer and monomer, indicating that it undergoes a change in environment as a result of the dimer-to-monomer transition. At pH 7.5 where its imidazole resonances are detectable, His-104 exists as the less common N\u03b41H tautomer, while the other four His residues are in the more common N\u03b52H tautomer. A resonance is observed at a chemical shift of 12.4 ppm for the N\u03b41H of His-104, indicating that it is hydrogen bonded. Among members of the solution ensemble, there are several potential H-bonding partners in proximity to His-104: the backbone carbonyls of His-83, Glu-105, and Glu-106 and side chain groups of Arg-107 and Arg-116 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

His-104 was substituted with either Gln or Lys and the mutant ACDs were compared to WT-HSPB5-ACD. As discussed above (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), peak doubling is observed in the spectrum of WT ACD below pH 7, with new peaks appearing at lower pH corresponding to ACD monomers. The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of H104Q-ACD has peak doubling even at pH 7.5 and the two sets of peaks correspond to dimer and monomer peaks already assigned in the WT spectrum (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, lower panel). The H104K-ACD HSQC spectrum has a single set of resonances under both pH conditions, but the peaks correspond to the monomer, even at pH 7.5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a>). Thus, substitution of His-104 with glutamine destabilizes the dimer so that approximately equal populations are observed at pH 7.5 and NMR concentrations. Glutamine at position 104 would have difficulty mimicking the N\u03b41H-bond formed by His-104. Substitution of His-104 with a positively charged lysine yields an ACD that is predominantly monomeric at pH 7.5. We did not determine <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> values for the mutants by dilution ITC experiments because the starting ACD concentration must be ten-fold above K<sub>D</sub>. Based on the relative populations of dimer and monomer peaks in the NMR spectra, we can estimate that the <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> for H104Q-ACD is \u223c100\u2013500 \u03bcM (approximately equal populations of dimer and monomer at [ACD] = 200 \u03bcM) and the K<sub>D</sub> for H104K-ACD is &gt;1 mM (based on our inability to detect dimer resonances in samples containing 200 \u03bcM protein). Although only order-of-magnitude, these estimates reveal that substitution of His-104 with Gln or Lys destabilizes the dimer more than 100-fold. To ascertain whether the effect of mutating His-104 is specific, the other four His residues were each mutated to Gln. The mutant ACDs retained the pH-dependent spectral behavior of the WT-ACD (data not shown). Altogether, the data implicate His-104, which sits at the base of Loop 5/6 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), as a hotspot whose conformation, H-bonding capacity, and protonation state strongly affect the stability of the HSPB5-ACD dimer interface."

SEC-MALS data of WT-HSPB5 oligomers confirmed previously reported pH-dependent changes in oligomeric dimension (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jehle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baldwin et al., 2011a</a>). At pH 7.5, the molecular weight (M<sub>w</sub>) determined at intervals across the elution peak ranged from 440 kDa to 500 kDa.

H104K-HSPB5 forms very large, polydispersed oligomers ranging from 785 to 840 kDa (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), with an average M<sub>w</sub> of 810 kDa (\u223c41 subunits). H104Q-HSPB5 oligomers elute at an intermediate position relative to WT- and H104K-HSPB5. Thus, more subunits are recruited when oligomers are assembled from destabilized dimers. We propose that oligomers composed of H104K-HSPB5 are made predominantly of monomeric units while oligomers composed of H104Q-HSPB5 contain both dimeric and monomeric units. If this model is accurate, we should be able to recapitulate intermediate-sized H104Q-containing oligomers by mixing together WT- and H104K-containing subunits. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, the elution position and oligomer mass in mixtures of WT-HSPB5 and H104K-HSPB5 titrate as a function of added H104K-HSPB5 subunits, consistent with a model in which oligomers are formed from both dimeric and monomeric units. WT-HSPB5 oligomers at pH 6.5 have a mass range that corresponds to a 1:2 ratio of WT:H104K subunits, indicating that the pH-dependent oligomeric assemblies likely arise from a combination of monomeric and dimeric subunits."

To ask if oligomers composed uniquely or partly of monomeric units have distinct structural features, negative-stain EM images of H104K-HSPB5 at pH 7.5 and WT-HSPB5 at pH 6.5 were collected and analyzed. In a majority of images, defined features, identified as light and dark regions of density, are apparent within the structures, indicating an organized arrangement of subunits. The particles are generally spherical, with some oblong-shaped structures also observed. Quantitative information on the size and distribution of oligomers was obtained by measuring the diameter of circular averages generated for each 2D projection average (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Single particles were then binned based on diameter of their corresponding average to generate a distribution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The size distribution derived in this way is consistent with the SEC-MALS analysis: WT-HSPB5 at pH 7.5 has the smallest average diameter, 15 nm, (a range of 13\u201317 nm), H104K-HSPB5 has the largest, with an average of 17 nm, and WT-HSPB5 at pH 6.5 is intermediate, at 16 nm. Oligomers of WT-HSPB5 at pH 6.5 cover the entire range of diameters measured, between 14 and &gt;18 nm, while the distribution of H104K-HSPB5 is skewed to the largest dimensions, with a majority of particles (&gt;70%) greater than 16 nm. For comparison, the diameter of the WT-HSPB5 cryo-EM model (<a href=\"#bib7\">Braun et al., 2011</a>) determined similarly from the circular average measures 15 nm, in good agreement with our measurements. Altogether the results reveal that conditions and/or mutations that affect the stability of the antiparallel dimer interface have substantial impact on HSPB5 oligomer size and structure."

We took advantage of the long delay in \u03b1Lac aggregation afforded by both the WT and mutant HSPB5 species to attempt to detect sHSP-client interactions. Mixtures of \u03b1Lac and one of the HSPB5 species were analyzed by SEC-MALS following addition of DTT and before the onset of aggregation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Although WT-HSPB5 maintains \u03b1Lac in a soluble form during the time frame of the experiment, no interaction between the two proteins was detected by SEC or SDS-PAGE, indicating that its holdase function is achieved through highly transient interactions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In contrast, a mixture of \u03b1Lac and H104K-HSPB5 elutes with a dramatically different profile. SDS-PAGE analysis across the broad peak that elutes between 7.5 and 9.2 ml shows that it contains both proteins (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). There is a broad range of molecular weights across this peak, from &gt;550 kDa to \u223c250 kDa. A similar but less dramatic change in the elution profile was obtained for a mixture of \u03b1Lac and H104Q-HSPB5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Thus, long-lived complexes are formed between \u03b1Lac and the H104 mutant HSPB5s, and these are markedly smaller than the oligomers that are populated in the absence of client protein."

Stresses such as ischemia and hypoxia are associated with acidosis in which cellular pH can decrease to as low as pH 6.4 (<a href=\"#bib25\">McVicar et al., 2014</a>). As HSPB5 must function under stress conditions, we sought to investigate effects of pH on its structure and function. sHSPs have three structural regions, each of which plays a role in oligomer assembly. The highly conserved ACD is necessary and sufficient for dimer formation and dimers are thought to be the fundamental building blocks for oligomers. The N- and C-terminal regions appear to drive oligomer assembly, although the details of these interactions are not yet elucidated. We find that HSPB5-ACD dimers dissociate into folded monomers that are favored as the pH decreases. ITC and NMR measurements revealed a modest affinity for the ACD dimer (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub> of 36 \u03bcM at pH 7.5, 37\u00b0C), with dimers dissociating at a rate of 400 s<sup>\u22121</sup>. The long \u03b26+7 strands of two subunits align in an antiparallel fashion to form the dimer interface. This structure with its associated H-bonds might be expected to afford higher affinity. The juxtaposition of Glu-117 and Glu-117\u2032 in the middle of the interface and the positively and negatively charged patches that cross the interface may contribute to the modest affinity and to the dynamics and plasticity we observed in the interface. Dimer affinity decreases 15-fold over 1 pH unit (pH 7.5 to pH 6.5) and this likely corresponds to a similar fold increase in the rate of dissociation at the dimer interface. A pH-dependent destabilization of the HSPB5-ACD dimer interface was inferred from native MS studies performed on oligomers as a function of pH; our results offer a direct confirmation and quantification of this hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baldwin et al., 2011b</a>)."

NMR spectra reveal that the His-104 ring is in the more unusual of the two possible tautomeric forms, stabilized by serving as an H-bond donor. Analysis of members of the solution structure ensemble and crystal structures with the Loop 5/6-up conformation identifies several backbone carbonyls as potential H-bond acceptors for His-104: His-83, Glu-105, and Glu-106. Alteration of the H-bonding potential or geometry (as in the H104Q mutant) or charge (as in the H104K mutant and low pH) destabilizes the dimer. Among the ten human sHSPs, His-104 is the most conserved His residue, appearing in eight of ten proteins, with the non-H104-containing sHSPs having a Gln (HSPB9) or a Lys (HSPB7) (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>).

His-104 is located at the beginning of Loop 5/6, the loop connecting strands \u03b25 and the dimer interface strand, \u03b26+7 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). NMR relaxation dispersion analysis of the ACD dimer revealed that residues in the dimer interface (116\u2013123) exist in two states consistent with a dimer-monomer equilibrium (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Residues in Loop 5/6 have similar exchange rates suggesting that loop movements and the structural transition may be coupled. However, a rigorous demonstration that the dynamics of the two regions are coupled requires a robust determination of <i>k</i><sub>ex</sub> values as a function of [ACD] for loop residues as well as interface residues and the data collected did not allow for this determination with sufficiently high confidence. Nevertheless, consistent with this notion, inter-subunit contacts are observed that involve Loop 5/6 residues: His-111 at the apex of Loop 5/6 makes contacts to Arg-120\u2019 and Tyr-122\u2019 across the dimer interface. These inter-subunit contacts help to position Loop 5/6 in a \u2018loop up\u2019 conformation in the solution structure at pH 7.5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A majority of residues in Loop 5/6 are charged (H<sup>104</sup>-E-E-R-Q-D-E-H<sup>111</sup>) so a possible consequence of His-104 protonation, which sits at the base of the loop, is to alter the conformation or position of Loop 5/6, disrupting inter-subunit contacts involving the loop and shifting the dimer\u2013monomer equilibrium of the HSPB5-ACD. In structures with the \u2018loop up\u2019 conformation, side chains of Arg-107 and Arg-116 are in proximity to His-104; the \u2018loop down\u2019 conformation moves Arg-107 away from His-104 and Glu-106 closer to His-104 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In sum, we propose that in both loop conformations His-104 sits at the center of a dynamic network of electrostatic and H-bonding interactions that is responsible for modulating the stability of the dimer interface."

In the \u2018loop up\u2019 structures, the details of the interactions between Loop 5/6 residues across the dimer interface vary, again pointing to the plasticity of this region. Nevertheless, the residues corresponding to His-111, Asp-109, and Arg-120 are involved in all cases. Furthermore, although Loop 5/6 contains predominantly polar and/or charged residues, it is remarkably well conserved among the human sHSPs (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>). There are several reported examples where Loop 5/6 residues affect the dimer-monomer equilibrium. In HSPB5, residues His-104, Asp-109, and His-111 have recently been implicated in Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding and the binding of divalent cation appears to destabilize the dimer interface (<a href=\"#bib22\">Mainz et al., 2012</a>). In HSPB1, which has an almost identical Loop 5/6 sequence to HSPB5, substitution of the two glutamate residues that correspond to HSPB5 Glu-105 and Glu-106 to Ala resulted in monomeric HSPB1-ACD (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baranova et al., 2011</a>). Also, a Loop 5/6 mutation in HSPB1, R127W (corresponding to Arg107 in HSPB5 numbering) is reported to promote monomer over dimer (<a href=\"#bib1\">Almeida-Souza et al., 2010</a>). In each case, a change in the net charge of Loop 5/6 leads to monomer being more favored. Altogether the observations suggest a model in which properties of Loop 5/6 are coupled to the stability of the dimer interface. It is notable that inheritance of single alleles of D109H-HSPB5 or R127W-HSPB1 is associated with cataract, myofibrillar myopathy, and distal hereditary motor neuropathy (<a href=\"#bib26\">Nefedova et al., 2013</a>).

While the notion that dimers are the fundamental building blocks of sHSP oligomers may describe the situation under certain conditions, our results indicate that oligomers can also be built from monomeric subunits and from combinations of dimeric and monomeric units and that more monomeric subunits can be incorporated into a given oligomer. This revelation will be important in any future attempts to determine HSPB5 oligomer structures for oligomers larger than the 24-mer previously determined (<a href=\"#bib7\">Braun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Jehle et al., 2011</a>)."

Both dimer-destabilizing mutations yield an HSPB5 that can delay aggregation of model clients longer than the wild-type protein at pH 7.5. Unexpectedly, the His-104 mutant proteins, which form much larger oligomers than WT-HSPB5, reorganize to form long-lived complexes with a client protein. EM images reveal particles that are markedly smaller and distinct from the mostly spherical sHSP-alone structures. During the time period in which WT-HSPB5 inhibits client protein aggregation, we were unable to detect a complex with the client, either by SEC or by EM. Thus, the mutant sHSPB5 species perform holdase function via a different mechanism from the wild-type protein at pH 7.5. WT-HSPB5 acts via weak-and-transient interactions while the mutants act via stronger-and-longer interactions. Notably, two inherited missense mutations in HSPB1 associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome, R127W-HPSB1 (in Loop 5/6) and S135F-HSPB1 (on the dimer interface), engage in stronger, longer-lived interactions with client proteins than the WT-HSPB1, as evidenced from tandem affinity purification (<a href=\"#bib1\">Almeida-Souza et al., 2010</a>). Two client binding modes have been observed in studies of the highly related HSPB4 (\u03b1A-crystallin), dubbed \u2018high capacity\u2019 and \u2018low capacity\u2019 based on differing client:sHSP stoichiometries (<a href=\"#bib24\">McHaourab et al., 2002</a>).

The findings in the current study indicate that the relative strength and, perhaps, abundance of these interactions can affect not only the size and structure of oligomers but also the way in which client proteins are recognized. Subunit exchange in WT-HSPB5 is orders of magnitude slower than the exchange rate we measured for the dimer-to-monomer transition (10<sup>\u22123</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> vs ca. 10<sup>3</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>, respectively, at pH 7.5, 37\u00b0C; <a href=\"#bib31\">Peschek et al., 2013</a>). So, while breaking the dimer interface is not the rate-limiting step in subunit exchange, destabilizing the ACD dimer yields oligomers that can more readily disassemble to form smaller species with clients and these complexes must be more stable than the mutant sHSP oligomers themselves. Long-lived sHSP-client complexes have been detected by SEC for Hsp18.1 from peas, but the complexes formed are larger than those of Hsp18.1 in the absence of client (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lee et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Stengel et al., 2010</a>). Hsp26 from yeast also forms larger complexes with client than in the absence (<a href=\"#bib11\">Franzmann et al., 2005</a>). These examples contrast with our findings, which imply that HSPB5 has evolved to perform its holdase function via weak-and-transient interactions and that small perturbations can unleash a second, cryptic mode of client interaction (long-and-strong). The highly charged ACD dimer interface and the proximal Loop 5/6 provide exquisite sensitivity to small changes in electrostatic environment that can be effected by slight changes in pH, temperature, divalent cations, other cellular conditions, and mutations. Of the approximately twenty inherited disease-related missense mutations documented in ACD regions of human sHSPs, more than half are in residues on the dimer interface or in Loop 5/6 and all these involve substitutions of charged residues."

Our results show unequivocally that the dimer interface stability decreases over a physiologically relevant pH range and that mutation (or protonation) of a single histidine residue is sufficient to destabilize the dimer. The His-104 mutants provide several general insights regarding the modulation of structure and function of sHSPs. First, the stability of an ACD dimer interface relative to other interactions involved in oligomer formation can modulate holdase function. In our study, destabilization of the dimer interface leads to enhanced holdase activity. It remains to be seen if the converse will be true. Second, dimer stability can be modulated by residues other than the dimer interface itself. Such effects are likely achieved through a network of conserved charged residues that ultimately favor or disfavor the dimer over monomer. Third, relatively small changes in pH or single missense mutations are capable of shifting HSPB5 from a weak, transient mode of client interaction to one that involves long-lived co-complexes. We propose that the continuum of oligomeric structures we observe for HSPB5 under differing pH (or mutation) may lead to a continuum of client-binding modes that allow the sHSP to ramp its holdase activity up or down as conditions require. A thorough understanding of the ways in which sHSP structure and activity can be modulated under differing cellular conditions will ultimately provide much needed insights into the cellular functions of this important, but previously intractable class of protein chaperones."

Intermolecular NOEs in homodimeric proteins are usually obtained from edited/filtered-type NOESY experiments on a mixed sample containing labeled and unlabeled protein. This method failed in the case of WT-ACD due to signal-to-noise issues. A preliminary structure of the dimer was determined with CS-Rosetta (<a href=\"#bib36\">Vernon et al., 2013</a>) and RosettaDock (<a href=\"#bib32\">Schueler-Furman et al., 2005</a>) (see below). The \u03b2-sandwich fold was determined from CS-Rosetta using backbone chemical shifts.

Starting from an extended chain, this protocol simultaneously explores the folding and docking degrees of freedom. It consists of four low-resolution stages of increasing complexity in the energy function, in which symmetric fragment insertions are interleaved with symmetric rigid-body trials. During the low-resolution step, side chains are represented using a single, residue-specific pseudo-atom, positioned at the C\u03b1 carbon. Finally, symmetric repacking of the side chains and gradient-based minimization of the side chain, rigid body, and backbone degrees of freedom are applied. In this high-resolution step, Rosetta's full-atom energy function is used. The conformational search is largely guided by experimental data, including intra- and inter-molecular NOE distance constraints and RDCs. A penalty term that is proportional to the rmsd between experimental and calculated data was used in Rosetta during the Monte Carlo trials and gradient-based minimization. NOE distances are modeled as atom pair constraints in Rosetta. For a structural model, RDCs are fitted using Levenberg\u2013Marquardt non-linear square fitting algorithm. The orientations of alignment tensor are optimized, while keeping the axial component (D\u03b1) and Rhombic component (R) of the alignment tensor fixed. The values of D\u03b1 and R of 21.5 and 0.35, respectively, were estimated from a powder pattern distribution of the RDC data. A total of 10,000 models are generated, of which 1000 lowest ones are selected for cluster analysis. Ten models with the lowest Rosetta full-atom energy in the best-ranked cluster were selected as the final structural ensemble and deposited in the Protein Databank as PDB 2N0K."

Aggregation of \u03b1Lac was induced by the addition of DTT to final concentrations of 50 mM. Aggregation of the model substrate Yeast Alcohol Dehydrogenase (Sigma A8656) was achieved with the addition of EDTA and DTT to final concentrations of 5 mM at 37\u00b0C. Light scattering by aggregates was monitored in the presence and absence of WT- and mutant HSPB5. 20 \u00b5M sHSP (subunit concentration) was added to 100 \u00b5M Alcohol Dehydrogenase."

The M<sub>w</sub> was determined from the Raleigh ratio calculated by measuring the static light scattering and corresponding protein concentration of a selected peak. Bovine serum albumin served as a calibration standard. Prior to SEC-MALS HSPB5 samples were pre-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min at 40 \u03bcM monomer concentration in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT. To examine HSPB5 behavior at pH 6.5, 40 \u03bcM of protein was allowed to equilibrate in phosphate buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT) at 37\u00b0C for at least 60 min. Substrate binding assays were performed under similar conditions established from \u03b1Lac holdase assays: HSPB5 (40 \u03bcM) was pre-incubated with \u03b1Lac (240 \u03bcM) at 37\u00b0C in pH 7.5 buffer for 10 min. DTT was subsequently added to a final concentration of 50 mM to trigger \u03b1Lac aggregation. After 50 min, the sample was filtered and injected for SEC-MALS analysis and fractionation. Light scattering data and calculations were performed using the ASTRA software package (Wyatt Technology Corporation)."

Micrograph images were phase-corrected following CTF estimation and HSPB5 particle projections were selected and excised from micrographs using <i>EMAN2</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tang et al., 2007</a>)<i>.</i> 2D reference-free alignment and classification was performed using <i>SPIDER</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frank et al., 1996</a>) to generate projection averages. For size estimation, rotational averages were generated from class averages using <i>SPIDER</i>. The contrast was normalized for all images and the diameter was measured across the rotational average. The averages were grouped according to size, and the total number of single particles for each group was used to obtain the size distribution. Independent data collection and analysis were performed in triplicate to obtain error bars."

The authors provide a range of convincing evidence, and also show that the effect is specific to His-104 (in the sequence of \u03b1B-crystallin). They provide a well argued overview of likely correlated structural changes. Using single site mutations they provide evidence that loss of His-104 results in large oliogmers built predominantly from monomers that function as stronger holdases than wild-type. They exploit this observation to isolate complexes of sHsp and model substrate that are smaller (unusually) than the native assembly."

We have added that information in the subsection \u201cA conserved histidine is responsible for destabilization of the HSPB5-ACD dimer\u201d and in the Discussion. The same group of interacting groups is also seen, in different combinations, in crystal structures that have the Loop 5/6-\u201cup\u201d conformation. We therefore believe that this is a dynamic network of interactions and are hesitant to show a detailed static picture that would only reflect one of the many possible sets of interactions as a figure in the main text. Nevertheless, analysis of structures in the Loop 5/6-\u201cdown\u201d conformation reveals that potential interactors move away from His-104 in this state, namely the side chain of Arg-107, and others appear to move into proximity, namely the side chain of Glu-106. We propose that in both loop conformations His-104 sits at the center of a dynamic network of electrostatic and H-bonding interactions that is responsible for modulating the stability of the dimer interface. We have clarified this point in the Discussion and have added a supplemental figure, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>\u2013figure supplement 1 that shows the relevant region of ensemble members and an example of a loop-up and loop-down structure."
