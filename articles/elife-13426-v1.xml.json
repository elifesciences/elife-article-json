This receptor is present not exclusively, but primarily on NK cells. Knowledge about the regulatory mechanisms controlling ULBP expression is still vague. In this study, we report a direct interaction of the oncogenic RNA binding protein (RBP) IMP3 with ULBP2 mRNA, leading to ULBP2 transcript destabilization and reduced ULBP2 surface expression in several human cell lines. We also discovered that IMP3 indirectly targets MICB with a mechanism functionally distinct from that of ULBP2. Importantly, IMP3-mediated regulation of stress-ligands leads to impaired NK cell recognition of transformed cells. Our findings shed new light on the regulation of NKG2D ligands and on the mechanism of action of a powerful oncogenic RBP, IMP3."

This receptor is present not exclusively, but primarily on NK cells. Knowledge about the regulatory mechanisms controlling ULBP expression is still vague. In this study, we report a direct interaction of the oncogenic RNA binding protein (RBP) IMP3 with ULBP2 mRNA, leading to ULBP2 transcript destabilization and reduced ULBP2 surface expression in several human cell lines. We also discovered that IMP3 indirectly targets MICB with a mechanism functionally distinct from that of ULBP2. Importantly, IMP3-mediated regulation of stress-ligands leads to impaired NK cell recognition of transformed cells. Our findings shed new light on the regulation of NKG2D ligands and on the mechanism of action of a powerful oncogenic RBP, IMP3."

They belong to the innate immune system (although they possess some adaptive features as well [<a href=\"#bib56\">Sun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Min-Oo et al., 2013</a>]) and are able to kill transformed cells, virus-infected cells and to interact with bacteria and fungi (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wu and Lanier, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lodoen and Lanier, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lanier, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Seidel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Schmidt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Koch et al., 2013</a>). The killing by NK cells is mediated by several NK -activating receptors, among them is NKG2D (<a href=\"#bib48\">Seidel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Koch et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bauer et al., 1999</a>). The ligands of NKG2D are MHC class I polypeptide-related sequences A and B (MICA, MICB) and the family of unique length 16 (UL16) binding proteins 1 \u2013 6 (ULBP 1\u20136), collectively known as stress-induced ligands (<a href=\"#bib8\">Elias and Mandelboim, 2012</a>). The stress-induced ligands are differentially expressed on the cell surface following stresses like viral infection, heat-shock or genotoxic stress (<a href=\"#bib43\">Raulet et al., 2013</a>). Accordingly, these ligands are important for immune surveillance and both cancer cells and viruses often suppress stress ligand surface expression (<a href=\"#bib8\">Elias and Mandelboim, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Salih et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fuertes et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Stern-Ginossar and Mandelboim, 2009</a>). Although mRNAs for some of these stress ligands are found almost in every cell, these ligands are barely expressed on the surface of healthy cells (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stern-Ginossar and Mandelboim, 2009</a>). This suggests that the expression of the NKG2D ligands is also controlled at mRNA level, and indeed, we have previously shown that 10 different cellular miRNAs negatively regulate the expression of MICA and MICB proteins (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nachmani et al., 2009</a>).

As control, we transduced RKO cells with a scrambled shRNA (RKO scrambled shRNA). We confirmed the knockdown using Western Blot (WB) with two different antibodies targeting IMP3 and used GAPDH as reference (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, shown is the WB with one of these anti-IMP3 antibodies). Quantification of the WB revealed a remaining protein expression of less than 10 percent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Additionally, we analyzed mRNA levels of IMP3 using qRT-PCR and observed a residual amount of about 13% mRNA of IMP3 compared to scrambled shRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Next, we analyzed the mRNA levels of the ULBP ligands in RKO shIMP3 compared to scrambled shRNA and observed a significant increase of ULBP2 mRNA levels following knockdown of IMP3 but no changes in mRNA levels of the other ULBP family members 1 and 3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). To assess the significance of this knockdown, we performed flow cytometry analysis of the NKG2D ligands ULBP1, 2 and 3. We observed an elevation in levels of ULBP2 upon IMP3 knockdown of more than 30%. The surface expression of ULBP3 was unchanged, while little or no expression of ULBP1 was observed on RKO cells prior and after the IMP3 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We quantified changes in ULBP2 levels in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>. In order to exclude a possible off-target effect of the shRNA that might cause the observed effects on the stress-ligand expression, we performed a rescue experiment of IMP3 expression in RKO (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Expectedly, stress-ligand levels decreased back after the transduction of IMP3 in shIMP3 cells."

To further confirm that IMP3 affects MICB expression, we overexpressed this RBP in the parental RKO cell line. A dramatic reduction of MICB expression was observed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) and only about 20% of the original MICB expression remained (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Consistent with our observations for the surface expression of MICB, we could also detect an elevation MICB, but not MICA, RNA levels in RKO cells following IMP3 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>).

The effect on ULBP2 expression in RKO, HCT116 and 293T cells were in a comparable magnitude. The impact of IMP3 was capable of altering ULBP2 expression up to 35% in the cell lines tested. However, we also observed an effect of IMP3 on another stress-induced ligand, MICB. Higher expression levels of IMP3 correlated with a reduction of MICB mRNA and surface expression. In contrast to ULBP2, we did not observe differences in half-life or a change in the luciferase activity in presence or absence of IMP3 for MICB. Also, the surface expression changes between knockdown and overexpression for ULBP2 and MICB varied tremendously: In the knockdown, the up-regulation of ULBP2 and MICB was more or less similar, but the IMP3 overexpression decreased only moderately ULBP2 expression, but drastically affected MICB expression. Thus, we concluded that the IMP3-dependant alterations in MICB expression are probably indirect. Most likely, IMP3 acts on a so far unidentified transcription factor or regulator that subsequently leads to alterations in MICB gene transcription. The identification and validation of this putative mediating factor requires further investigation which is beyond the scope of this manuscript."

The recent discoveries about the role in placental trophoblasts might also shed a light on the array of target genes that are known to be affected by IMP3, for instant CD44 expression that is up-regulated by IMP3 is important in migration of trophoblasts within the placenta. Accordingly, the destabilization of ULBP2 mRNA and regulation of MICB expression described in this study might also protect trophoblasts in the placenta from NK cells, which are the most abundant population of lymphocytes present in the decidua during early pregnancy (<a href=\"#bib59\">Varla-Leftherioti, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">S\u00e1nchez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2011</a>).

The vector contains a SV40 promoter replacing the natural gene promoter and a SV40 polyadenylation site. 1.25 x 10<sup>5</sup> RKO cells transfected with scrambled or IMP3-specific shRNA were seeded into 24-well-plates. The next day, the cells were transfected using TransIT-LT1 reagent (MIRUS Bio, WI, USA) with 250\u00a0ng of Firefly-Luciferase vector containing the 3\u2019UTRs, and 50\u00a0ng of Renilla Luciferase vector (pRL-CMV) as reference. 28\u2009hr post transfection, cells were lysed and luciferase activity measured using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, WI, USA). For the assessment of differences of luciferase activity of the shortened 3\u2019UTRs of ULBP2, following UTRs were cloned into pGL3: 1\u2013100 bp (basepairs), 1\u2013200 bp, 1\u2013300 bp, 1\u2013400 bp and full length UTR (540 bp). 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> RKO cells were seeded and the following day transfected with constructs coding for these shortened UTRs. Cells were harvested and analyzed 28\u2009hr post transfection. For the binding site analysis of IMP3 in ULBP2-3\u2019UTR, the putative-binding motif CATT at position 162 \u2013 165 was mutated into CAGG to prevent binding of IMP3 to the RNA. 1\u00a0x\u00a010<sup>5</sup> RKO cells were transfected with the unchanged, wild type UTR of ULBP2 or the CAGG-mutated UTR and harvested 28\u2009hr post transfection.

D-Actinomycin effectively inhibits the elongation process of the RNA polymerase II, thereby suppressing the synthesis of new mRNA transcripts (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sobell, 1985</a>). After 16\u2009hr incubation, medium was removed, and cells were harvested following the manufacturers\u2019 protocol for RNA extraction (Zymo Research, CA, USA). cDNA was prepared using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. qRT-PCR was performed as mentioned in the corresponding section. For analysis, we defined the level of a specific mRNA in the DMSO-treated control cells (diluent control) in both the scrambled shRNA- and shIMP3-transduced cells as 1. By calculating the ratio of mRNA level after 16\u2009hr D-Actinomycin treatment and 16\u2009hr DMSO treatment, we assessed the rate of mRNA decay in dependence of IMP3."

ULBP2 represents one out of eight human stress-induced surface ligands of the activating NKG2D receptor that is expressed on cytotoxic lymphocytes. By mass spectrometry, the authors identified IMP3 as a protein binding in vitro to the 3'UTR of ULBP2 mRNA. A similar unbiased approach has already been used earlier by the authors to describe RPBs for the 3'UTR of another human NKG2D ligand (MICB) (Nachmani et al., 2014; ref. 48). Here, they demonstrate that manipulation of IMP3 expression (shRNA, overexpression) alters cellular expression of ULBP2 in three different cell lines, though the effects appear modest. Functional IMP3 binding to the 3'UTR of ULBP2 transcripts is validated in luciferase reporter assays. Finally, IMP3 down-regulation (by shRNA) is shown to significantly increase susceptibility to NK cytotoxicity in an NKG2D-dependent manner. Overall, the results provide evidence for a novel role of the IMP3 oncogene in cancer immune evasion via down-regulation of ULBP2."

Thus, as suggested by the reviewers and editors, the NKG2D dependent killing is not only stimulated by increased ULBP2 levels, but also by MICB up-regulation. However, we checked in shIMP3 RKO cells luciferase activity and MICB mRNA stability and concluded from our results that the regulation of ULBP2 and MICB has unequal underlying mechanisms. ULBP2 is directly targeted by IMP3, whereas MICB is not.
