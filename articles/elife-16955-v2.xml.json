To better understand this control, we profiled translational efficiencies and poly(A)-tail lengths throughout Drosophila oocyte maturation and early embryonic development. The correspondence between translational-efficiency changes and tail-length changes indicated that tail-length changes broadly regulate translation until gastrulation, when this coupling disappears. During egg activation, relative changes in poly(A)-tail length, and thus translational efficiency, were largely retained in the absence of cytoplasmic polyadenylation, which indicated that selective poly(A)-tail shortening primarily specifies these changes. Many translational changes depended on PAN GU and Smaug, and these changes were largely attributable to tail-length changes. Our results also revealed the presence of tail-length\u2013independent mechanisms that maintained translation despite tail-length shortening during oocyte maturation, and prevented essentially all translation of <i>bicoid</i> and several other mRNAs before egg activation. In addition to these fundamental insights, our results provide valuable resources for future studies."

Within each sheet, the initial Refseq ID is the dm6 Refseq ID that was selected for each gene on the basis of being the longest annotated isoform of that gene. For many genes, the 3' end of this gene model was extended to include the most distal isoform supported by PAL-seq data. RPKM is reads per kilobase per million mapped reads. Descriptions of the analyses include the measurement cutoffs applied to RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and PAL-seq data, as applicable. The 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> columns specify whether a 10 RPM cutoff for RNA-seq or ribosome profiling data was met, and the 10<sup>th</sup> column specifies whether a 100 tag cutoff for PAL-seq data was met. All transcripts with a 3' UTR that overlapped a snoRNA or snRNA were excluded from analysis, as indicated in the final column."

To better understand this control, we profiled translational efficiencies and poly(A)-tail lengths throughout Drosophila oocyte maturation and early embryonic development. The correspondence between translational-efficiency changes and tail-length changes indicated that tail-length changes broadly regulate translation until gastrulation, when this coupling disappears. During egg activation, relative changes in poly(A)-tail length, and thus translational efficiency, were largely retained in the absence of cytoplasmic polyadenylation, which indicated that selective poly(A)-tail shortening primarily specifies these changes. Many translational changes depended on PAN GU and Smaug, and these changes were largely attributable to tail-length changes. Our results also revealed the presence of tail-length\u2013independent mechanisms that maintained translation despite tail-length shortening during oocyte maturation, and prevented essentially all translation of <i>bicoid</i> and several other mRNAs before egg activation. In addition to these fundamental insights, our results provide valuable resources for future studies."

Spermatogenesis produces haploid sperm capable of penetrating the oocyte, whereas oogenesis produces differentiated oocytes that are stockpiled with maternal nutrients, proteins, and mRNAs, and have outer layers that protect the embryo and enable fertilization. In most animals the oocyte is arrested in meiosis, and fertilization leads to initiation of mitosis as the oocyte nucleus completes meiosis and fuses with the haploid sperm nucleus. Fertilization also leads to changes in mRNA translation and protein stability, which support a period of development driven off of maternal stockpiles. After this initial stage of maternal control, which lasts for 1\u20132 mitotic divisions in mammals and 13 mitotic divisions in Drosophila, widespread transcription begins from the zygotic nuclei (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</a>)."

Oocyte maturation involves the release of the primary meiotic arrest at prophase I and progression of the oocyte nucleus into meiotic divisions to produce a mature oocyte (egg) capable of being fertilized (<a href=\"#bib54\">Von Stetina and Orr-Weaver, 2011</a>). The mature oocyte is arrested in metaphase II in most vertebrates and metaphase I in insects. The OET requires egg activation, which is coupled to fertilization in most animals. Egg activation releases the secondary meiotic arrest, allowing completion of meiosis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Horner and Wolfner, 2008</a>). The MZT marks the transfer of control of development from the mother to the zygote as maternal mRNAs are degraded, transcription from the zygotic genome begins, and embryonic development becomes dependent on zygotic gene products (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</a>). In Xenopus, zebrafish, and Drosophila the major activation of zygotic transcription occurs as the cell cycle lengthens and gastrulation begins, a developmental period referred to as the midblastula transition."

Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression during oocyte maturation, the OET, and early embryogenesis faces unique challenges, including stably storing maternal mRNAs through the prolonged periods of oogenesis and maintaining some of these mRNAs in a translationally inactive state (referred to as masking) while selectively translating others at the proper times in development. During mouse oocyte maturation ~1300 mRNAs are translationally upregulated and ~1500 are translationally downregulated (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2011</a>).

The observation of short poly(A) tails in oocytes from amphibians and marine invertebrates led to the proposal that short poly(A) tails help mask maternal mRNAs, preventing translation without triggering the destabilization that typically results from deadenylation. Specific mRNAs are then targeted for cytoplasmic polyadenylation, and the lengthened poly(A) tails in turn cause translational upregulation of these mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib32\">McGrew et al., 1989</a>), as demonstrated for the mRNAs for <i>c</i>-<i>mos</i> and several cyclin genes during oocyte maturation in Xenopus (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sheets et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barkoff et al., 1998</a>). The Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding Protein (CPEB) plays a critical role in controlling translation of maternal mRNAs, both in recruiting Maskin to repress translation and later in promoting polyadenylation by binding cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase together with Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Richter, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Weill et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ivshina et al., 2014</a>).

These repressors can impact either poly(A)-tail length (<a href=\"#bib50\">Temme et al., 2014</a>), the translational machinery, or both. Brain Tumor and Pumilio (PUM) bind to target mRNAs and recruit the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, which shortens poly(A) tails (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kadyrova et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Temme et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Newton et al., 2015</a>). Bruno binds to target mRNAs during oogenesis and recruits the eIF4E-binding protein Cup, which represses translation by both blocking the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nakamura et al., 2004</a>) and promoting deadenylation while repressing decapping, which traps mRNAs in a translationally repressed state (<a href=\"#bib22\">Igreja and Izaurralde, 2011</a>).

Measuring poly(A)-tail lengths has been more challenging due to the homopolymeric nature of the tail, and this technical hurdle has restricted studies to measuring tail lengths of a small number of Drosophila mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Salles et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lieberfarb et al., 1996</a>) or to estimating relative differences in tail lengths more broadly using hybridization-based methods (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cui et al., 2013</a>).

In zebrafish and Xenopus, high-throughput measurements demonstrate that poly(A)-tail length and TE are globally coupled during early embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib45\">Subtelny et al., 2014</a>), as expected from single-gene studies (<a href=\"#bib32\">McGrew et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sheets et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lieberfarb et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barkoff et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pesin and Orr-Weaver, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Benoit et al., 2008</a>). Surprisingly, however, this coupling disappears at gastrulation and is not observed in any of the post-embryonic samples examined (<a href=\"#bib45\">Subtelny et al., 2014</a>). Thus, soon after a developmental shift in transcriptional control (the MZT), these vertebrate species undergo a developmental shift in translational control, in which TE abruptly changes from being strongly coupled to tail length to being uncoupled."

Here we systematically analyze changes in poly(A)-tail length and TE during oocyte maturation, the OET and the MZT, and delineate the roles of Wispy, PNG, and SMG in regulating translation during these crucial periods.

PAL-seq determines the poly(A)-tail length of millions of mRNA molecules, providing for each molecule both a fluorescent measurement that reports on the poly(A)-tail length and a sequencing read that reports the cleavage and poly(A) site. Because alternative start sites or alternative splicing can generate different transcripts with the same poly(A) site, we considered our results with respect to a curated set of unique gene models. Moreover, because alternative cleavage and polyadenylation can generate different poly(A) sites for mRNAs from the same gene, we used our PAL-seq data to identify for each gene the alternative isoform with the longest 3' UTR and then combined its tail-length measurements with those of any shorter tandem 3'-UTR isoforms. Thus, the 'mRNAs' of our analyses each corresponded to a unique gene model representing a different protein-coding gene and the aggregated tail-length results from many (if not all) of the alternative transcripts from that gene. On the same samples as those analyzed by PAL-seq, we performed ribosome-footprint profiling and RNA-seq to determine TEs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>), which also report aggregate results for alternative isoforms, allowing comparison of mean poly(A)-tail length and TE for\u00a0the thousands of mRNAs that passed our quantification cutoffs at each stage."

Because ribosome-profiling data reflect relative rather than absolute levels of translation of an mRNA across developmental stages, these results should be interpreted as reflecting changes in how well an mRNA was translated relative to all other mRNAs in the same stage. Thus, an mRNA translated at the same absolute efficiency in two stages might be perceived as downregulated if translation of many other mRNAs increased. Nonetheless, these dynamic and substantial changes in TE observed during the OET and early embryogenesis revealed a large-scale and rapid change in the translational capacity of mRNAs relative to each other during early development."

Previously, the relationship between poly(A)-tail length and translation had been examined for the <i>c-mos</i> mRNA\u00a0and\u00a0several cyclin mRNAs during Xenopus oocyte maturation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sheets et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barkoff et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Piqu\u00e9 et al., 2008</a>). Our results extended these analyses to an invertebrate and to a global scale, showing that, as for the <i>c-mos</i> mRNA\u00a0and several\u00a0cyclin mRNAs in the Xenopus oocyte, tail-length increases correspond to translational activation in the maturing Drosophila oocyte. Thus, the global coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE, which had previously been examined only after fertilization (<a href=\"#bib45\">Subtelny et al., 2014</a>), extends well before fertilization to potentially influence key developmental transitions in the oocyte."

Between oocyte stages 11 through 14, the TEs of these mRNAs increased 103, 248, and 319 fold (compared to a median TE change of only 1.3 fold), respectively, whereas poly(A)-tail lengths increased 1.6, 2.4, and 2.0 fold (compared to the median of 1.2 fold) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In addition to these examples, mRNAs from 121 other genes were very poorly translated in stage 11 oocytes (TE \u2264 0.1) and became \u226510-fold better translated during oocyte maturation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

However, for <i>cyclin B, cyclin B3</i> and <i>fizzy</i> mRNAs, the distribution of poly(A)-tail lengths remained unimodal as overall lengths increased, which indicated that the focus on the mean tail-length change in our analyses did not miss specific regulation of a subset of mRNAs for a gene (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Also helpful for considering the effects of increasing tail lengths during oocyte maturation is the steep relationship between poly(A)-tail length and TE during this developmental period (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The steepness of this relationship in stage 11, 12, and 13 oocytes implied a 6- to 7-fold increase in the median TE for mRNAs with a poly(A)-tail length between 70\u201380 nt relative to those with a poly(A)-tail length between 30\u201340 nt. In stage 14 oocytes, the poor correlation between tail length and TE resulted in only a 1.8-fold increase in median TE when comparing mRNAs with such tail lengths. Thus during oocyte maturation, the modest increases observed in mean poly(A)-tail lengths presumably explain part, but not all, of the robust translational activation of <i>cyclin B, cyclin B3, fizzy</i>, and mRNAs from many other genes. Moreover, a broad range of TE values was observed for mRNAs with the same mean poly(A)-tail length, presumably as a consequence of additional regulatory processes that are independent of poly(A)-tail length. To the extent that these additional processes act concordantly with tail-length\u2013dependent processes, they would increase the apparent effect of tail lengthening."

In our analyses, translation of <i>bicoid</i> mRNA was undetectable or detected with very few reads in oocytes from stages 11 through 14, but it became much more highly translated following egg activation, increasing by 36 fold in the activated egg relative to the stage 14 oocyte (median TE change, 1.2 fold). mRNAs for <i>torso</i> and <i>Toll</i> were somewhat better translated in stage 14 oocytes, but nonetheless their TEs increased 13 and 46 fold, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). During this time, the <i>Toll</i> poly(A)-tail length increased 3.3 fold (median tail length change, 1.1 fold), which corresponded well to the trend observed globally for tail-length and TE changes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), suggesting that its increased tail-length might fully account for its increased TE. However, concordantly acting tail-length\u2013independent processes that increase the apparent effect of tail-length changes might also be influencing <i>Toll</i> translation. Indeed, our subsequent experiments with <i>wispy</i>-mutant animals showed that in the absence of cytoplasmic polyadenylation, <i>Toll</i> underwent substantial translational upregulation during egg activation and remained one of the most efficiently translated mRNAs in the <i>wispy</i>-mutant laid egg, despite having a mean tail length of only 14 nt. The poly(A)-tail lengths of <i>bicoid</i> and <i>torso</i> increased by only 1.7 and 1.3 fold, respectively, putting them outside the global trend (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), and the unimodal tail-length distributions showed again that our focus on the mean change did not miss a unique behavior of a subpopulation of transcripts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Because <i>bicoid</i> mRNA had an average tail length of 42 nt in stage 14 oocytes, which was similar to that of many well translated mRNAs at this stage, we conclude that there was likely a translational repressor acting on it in oocytes to prevent its translation prior to egg activation. The same is presumably true for other mRNAs that had little to no detectable translation in oocytes but then became efficiently translated following egg activation. For mRNAs such as <i>torso</i>, which had somewhat greater translation in stage 14 oocytes but subsequently experienced a TE increase that was out of proportion to its tail-length increase, either possibility might account for its translational upregulation at egg activation. Likewise, the 15-fold and 4-fold translational activation observed between stage 14 oocytes and 0\u20131 hr embryos for <i>zelda</i> and <i>stat92E</i>, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), were accompanied by only 1.2-fold changes in poly(A)-tail length for both mRNAs (median TE change, 1.2 fold; median tail length change, 1.1 fold), again implying that a component of their activation may have occurred through a tail-length independent mechanism (note that the poly(A)-tail length of <i>zelda</i> was quantified by only 31 and 72 tags in stage 14 oocytes and 0\u20131 hr embryos, respectively)."

To characterize the extent to which these downstream regulators might use tail-length changes to influence TE, we profiled poly(A)-tail lengths and TEs in <i>png</i>-mutant stage 14 oocytes and activated eggs. Poly(A)-tail lengths and TEs were highly correlated between <i>png</i>-mutant and wild-type stage 14 oocytes, whereas the correlation was substantially lower between <i>png</i>-mutant and wild-type activated eggs (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Additionally, the poly(A)-tail lengths and TEs in <i>png</i>-mutant activated eggs were quite similar to those in <i>png</i>-mutant stage 14 oocytes, whereas this was not the case for the same comparisons among wild-type samples (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The requirement of PNG for achieving the gene-expression profile of the wild-type activated egg but not the stage 14 oocyte was consistent with PNG kinase becoming active during egg activation to serve as a master regulator of the OET (<a href=\"#bib42\">Shamanski and Orr-Weaver, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kronja et al., 2014b</a>)."

SMG is reported to downregulate translation of its target mRNAs through either direct recruitment of the deadenylation machinery or recruitment of CUP, which directly represses translation initiation and can also promote deadenylation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nelson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Semotok et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Igreja and Izaurralde, 2011</a>). Our results showed that in the absence of SMG, the poly(A)-tail lengths for the set of PNG-dependent downregulated mRNAs were less shortened during egg activation (median\u00a0tail-length log<sub>2</sub>\u00a0fold changes of \u20130.22 and \u20130.04 for the wild-type and <i>smg</i> mutant, respectively, relative to the median of all mRNAs, p&lt;10<sup>\u201327</sup>, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test), and this coincided with their partial translational derepression (median TE\u00a0log<sub>2</sub>\u00a0fold change of \u20132.2 and \u20131.2, respectively, after median centering,\u00a0p&lt;10<sup>\u201332</sup>, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In contrast, no significant difference was observed for either poly(A)-tail length or TE changes for the PNG-dependent upregulated mRNAs (median\u00a0tail-length log<sub>2</sub>\u00a0fold changes of 0.27 for both the wild-type and <i>smg</i> mutant relative to the median of all mRNAs, and median\u00a0TE log<sub>2</sub>\u00a0fold changes of 2.8 and 2.7, respectively, after median centering for the wild-type and <i>smg</i> mutant, p=0.89 and 0.37 for tail-length or TE changes, respectively, two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test), consistent with SMG functioning only as a repressor (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In general, mRNAs that were translationally repressed by SMG also decreased in poly-(A)-tail length, which indicated that recruitment of deadenylases was the dominant mechanism of SMG-dependent translational repression occurring during egg activation and early embryogenesis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Additionally, in the absence of SMG, a set of mRNAs reported to be bound by SMG in the early embryo (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2014</a>) had longer poly(A) tails and were better translated following the OET (median\u00a0tail-length log<sub>2</sub>\u00a0fold changes of \u20130.21 and \u20130.04 for the wild-type and <i>smg</i> mutant, respectively, relative to the median of all mRNAs, and median\u00a0TE log<sub>2</sub>\u00a0fold changes of \u20131.0 and \u20130.15, respectively, after median centering, p&lt;10<sup>\u201316</sup> and 10<sup>\u201311</sup> for tail length or TE changes, respectively, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

At least as early as the primary meiotic arrest point, changes in poly(A)-tail length largely explain changes in TE, and this regulatory strategy continues through early embryonic development. A switch around the onset of gastrulation uncouples poly(A)-tail length and TE in Drosophila, mirroring the developmental timing of the same uncoupling in zebrafish and Xenopus embryos. The uncoupling of TE from poly(A)-tail length is thus a broadly conserved developmental switch in the nature of translational control, occurring around the onset of gastrulation in both vertebrate and invertebrate embryos."

Because previous single-gene studies clearly demonstrate a causal role for cytoplasmic polyadenylation, and poly(A)-tail length itself, in regulating the translation of mRNAs during these developmental times (<a href=\"#bib32\">McGrew et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Salles et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barkoff et al., 1998</a>), we interpret our observation of a global correlation between poly(A)-tail length and TE as reflecting a causal relationship between the two wherein tail-length changes cause TE changes.

Of particular interest was Wispy, the cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase that acts during late oogenesis and early embryogenesis, and is essential for the OET (<a href=\"#bib4\">Benoit et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2008</a>). Analysis of <i>wispy</i> mutants revealed key insights into both the mechanism of translational activation and the importance of tail shortening (as opposed to tail lengthening) in specifying translational control in Drosophila maturing oocytes and early embryos. Although poly(A)-tail lengths were typically shorter in <i>wispy</i>-mutant stage 13 oocytes and laid eggs compared to the corresponding wild-type samples, tail length and TE were coupled in both of these <i>wispy</i>-mutant contexts, and the relative changes in poly(A)-tail lengths during the OET in wild-type samples were largely preserved in the <i>wispy</i>-mutant samples, as were the changes in TE. Thus, the act of cytoplasmic polyadenylation is not necessary for the coupling of poly(A)-tail length to translation. Moreover, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is largely dispensable for specifying which mRNAs are to be translationally activated or repressed, implying that in Drosophila, selective deadenylation is more important for imparting this specificity. This greater importance for deadenylation does not preclude a role for selective cytoplasmic polyadenylation in translational control in Drosophila\u2014differences were observed when comparing TE changes in wild-type and <i>wispy</i>-mutant samples (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), and when comparing RPF measurements between wild-type and <i>wispy</i>-mutant samples (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), including for <i>cortex</i>, a critical OET regulator. However, the greater importance of selective deadenylation for specifying translational control in Drosophila differs from the prevailing paradigm of vertebrates, which centers on selective cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNAs with cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (<a href=\"#bib37\">Piqu\u00e9 et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Weill et al., 2012</a>). This suggests either a fundamental difference between invertebrates and vertebrates or that an underappreciated component of translational control in vertebrates occurs through more global cytoplasmic polyadenylation with selective deadenylation."

Why does this developmental arrest occur if translational regulation is largely preserved during egg activation in <i>wispy</i> mutants? One possibility is that the absolute level of translation in <i>wispy</i>-mutant eggs is reduced such that they make an inadequate amount of one or more essential protein. The other possibility rests on the observation that although TE changes and RPFs were remarkably concordant in the <i>wispy</i>-mutant and wild-type samples, they were not identical, and thus an aberrant change in expression for one or more key factor, such as <i>cortex</i>, might be sufficient to trigger the developmental arrest of <i>wispy</i>-mutant laid eggs."

Additionally, although SMG is reported to act partly through a mechanism that does not involve deadenylation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nelson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Semotok et al., 2005</a>), essentially all the derepression observed in the <i>smg</i>-mutant embryos was accompanied by tail-length increases.

One unanticipated complexity was the evidence for tail-length\u2013independent processes that appear to amplify the tail-length\u2013dependent effects, as already discussed. Additional unanticipated complexity was observed during oocyte maturation, in which surprisingly diverse patterns of regulatory dynamics produce the ultimate changes in TE. Single-gene studies in Xenopus, which show that <i>c-mos</i> mRNA becomes polyadenylated and translated prior to the mRNAs for several <i>cyclin B</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Richter, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Piqu\u00e9 et al., 2008</a>), hint that the complex landscape of translational control observed in Drosophila extends to vertebrate oocyte maturation. The diverse temporal behaviors of translational regulation during oocyte maturation might reflect the evolving demands on the maturing oocyte, or perhaps simply differences in the timing of expression of RNA-binding proteins that interact with these different sets of mRNAs. Regardless, the observation of different temporal patterns of regulation indicates that rather than being a sudden switch, oocyte maturation in Drosophila is a progressive process, whereby mRNAs are translationally activated or repressed at different times throughout this developmental transition."

To escape the general regulatory environment of the cytoplasm, these mRNAs might exploit unique interactions with the translational machinery analogous to the translational activation of histone mRNAs through stem-loop binding protein (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cakmakci et al., 2008</a>), or they might localize to a subcellular compartment that lacks coupling. The deadenylation of these mRNAs during oogenesis might prime them for rapid degradation during embryogenesis. Most mRNAs from genes encoding proteasome subunits fell into this class. Previous comparisons of the proteome and translation changes suggest that extensive proteolysis occurs at egg activation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kronja et al., 2014b</a>). Upregulation of the proteasome in late oogenesis might necessitate a mechanism to downregulate it rapidly during embryogenesis, perhaps facilitated by pre-deadenylating the corresponding mRNAs before egg activation."

Moreover, the identification of unanticipated complexities and exceptions reveals the rich posttranscriptional regulatory landscape of oocytes and early embryos and points to additional mechanisms that operate for some mRNAs in specific settings, which can now be targeted for investigation."

Detailed protocols are available at <a href=\"http://bartellab.wi.mit.edu/protocols.html\">http://bartellab.wi.mit.edu/protocols.html</a>. The wild-type stage 14 oocyte and activated egg samples were prepared using RPF lysis buffer and sucrose gradients that did not contain cycloheximide, all other samples were prepared using RPF lysis buffer and sucrose gradients that contained cycloheximide. Because TE changes between wild-type stage 14 oocytes and activated eggs for samples prepared with and without cycloheximide correlated very well (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kronja et al., 2014b</a>), the omission of cycloheximide did not affect our observations pertaining to these stages. RPF and RNA-seq reads were mapped to ORFs of representative transcript models as described, which excluded the first 50 nt of each ORF to eliminate signal from ribosomes that initiated after adding cycloheximide (<a href=\"#bib45\">Subtelny et al., 2014</a>). PAL-seq tags were mapped to 3' UTRs of representative transcript models, and PAL-seq fluorescence intensities were converted to tail lengths as described (<a href=\"#bib45\">Subtelny et al., 2014</a>)."

These data provide interesting insights into the correlation between mRNA translation and poly(A) tail length during various stages of development, and represent a valuable resource. However, a number of issues require clarification, and the manuscript needs to be improved through additional analyses, and made more useful to the reader through the presentation of additional information, as described in the specific comments below:"

However, while measurement of fold differences is one approach for quantifying poly(A) tail length changes, this approach is not sensitive and not the most informative when the reference stage gene has a long poly(A) tail. For example, a change in poly(A) length from 10 to 20 yields a 2-fold change; however, a poly(A) tail lengthened from 40 to 80 also yields a 2-fold change, despite the fact that the absolute change is four times greater for the second gene compared to the first gene. This absolute change is not reflected in examining the fold change of the tail length, which may be problematic if one assumes that PABP has a role in linking changes in tail length to changes in translation. The minimum poly(A) length bound by PABP is 12 residues and, on longer tracts, PABP binds approximately every 25 residues (Mol Cell Biol. 1987 Sep;7(9):3268, RNA 2005 Jul;11(7):1131). PABP binding-site length and the additional number of possible PABP copies bound (i.e. change in length as measured by the number of additional PABP that can bind to the transcript) need to be considered when examining changes in poly(A) tail length, and when performing analysis of TE. This analysis would be particularly enlightening in explaining large changes in TE that correspond to apparently small fold-changes in poly(A) tail length."

For example, while previous works show that (for maternal mRNAs) elongation of the poly(A) tail from 20-30 to 80-100 As causes translational activation (presumably by allowing the formation of the close-loop eIF4E-eIF4G-PABP), there is no evidence showing that further elongation has any impact. Thus, more than a linear correlation, poly(A) tail length may have a bimodal regulatory effect. This is supported by recent evidence (Park et al., 2016) indicating that a single PABP (binding 30-40 As) may be sufficient to support full translational activation. Therefore, \u0394P(A) does not have the same meaning when it goes from 20 to 40 As than from 100 to 200 As."

Although some potential correlations are found for <i>wispy, png</i> and <i>smg</i>, the main problem of this approach is that it does not differentiate between direct and indirect effects and all three genes have a profound impact in early embryonic development. This is clearly shown in the global deadenylation in <i>wispy</i>-mut oocytes and embryos. Obviously, this phenotype cannot be ascribed to the direct role of wispy in cytoplasmic polyadenylation, which should only affect a reduced number of mRNAs. In turn, the fact that these global changes do not impact the TE/poly(A) distribution over WT, can be due to the competitive nature of the poly(A) tail effect."

However, while measurement of fold differences is one approach for quantifying poly(A) tail length changes, this approach is not sensitive and not the most informative when the reference stage gene has a long poly(A) tail. For example, a change in poly(A) length from 10 to 20 yields a 2-fold change; however, a poly(A) tail lengthened from 40 to 80 also yields a 2-fold change, despite the fact that the absolute change is four times greater for the second gene compared to the first gene. This absolute change is not reflected in examining the fold change of the tail length, which may be problematic if one assumes that PABP has a role in linking changes in tail length to changes in translation. The minimum poly(A) length bound by PABP is 12 residues and, on longer tracts, PABP binds approximately every 25 residues (Mol Cell Biol. 1987 Sep;7(9):3268, RNA 2005 Jul;11(7):1131). PABP binding-site length and the additional number of possible PABP copies bound (i.e. change in length as measured by the number of additional PABP that can bind to the transcript) need to be considered when examining changes in poly(A) tail length, and when performing analysis of TE. This analysis would be particularly enlightening in explaining large changes in TE that correspond to apparently small fold-changes in poly(A) tail length.</i>"

However, we, like the referee, might have expected the absolute tail-length changes to still be more informative if the main influence of changing the tail was to change the number of PABP proteins that could bind. If, however, PABP was limiting during the stages in which we observed coupling between tail length and TE changes, and mRNAs were competing for the limiting pool of PABP, then the relative changes would be at least as informative as absolute changes because a 2-fold lengthening would be expected to have the same relative effect on ability to compete for PABP regardless of whether a poly(A)-tail increased from 20 to 40 nt or from 40 to 80 nt. Thus, our observation that relative changes were as informative as absolute changes implies that mRNAs are competing for PABP.
