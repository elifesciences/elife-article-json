The height of the bar is, therefore, an objective measure of performance and a reasonable way to determine the winner of the competition. However, I have been struck by how often I hear the phrase \u2018raising the bar\u2019 when discussing, for example, students taking exams or faculty being considered for tenure and promotion."

In the pole vault, there can only be one winner in each competition. Moreover, the criterion for naming the winner is unitary, agreed upon, and entirely unambiguous. Nothing we do in science is analogous. We are, we hope, promoting many great scientists and publishing many great papers. The purpose of a tenure and promotion committee or an editorial board is not to find the single gold medalist, but to recognize excellence, often across many dimensions, including some that are difficult or impossible to quantify."

If a department is doing a search for a new assistant professor, for example, there is often only one position available at a given time. However, it is not uncommon for the first choice candidate to decline the position. More importantly, if search committees are honest with themselves, they will usually acknowledge that there are multiple exceptional candidates who differ in many qualities, and that the decision is rarely so simple as \u2018Who is better?\u2019. More often the relevant question is: \u2018Who is the best fit for what we are trying to achieve, since we are forced to make a choice?\u2019"

Of course, there are rare cases where the finish line is obvious, as in who was first to purify the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, or to solve the crystal structure of an ion channel. But we don't fill journal pages with papers about such clearly defined big successes. And in the long run, being first may not be as important as getting it right. More importantly, when two labs are working simultaneously on an important problem, and arrive at similar conclusions within a short time of each other, the \u2018second\u2019 paper actually strengthens the conclusions of the first, so it is important that the second paper is published just as quickly as the first and that the authors receive their fair share of recognition. In today's world, rife with concerns about \u2018failures to replicate\u2019, we should celebrate the replication of an important finding, not penalize those authors for coming in second."

Sadly, some among us take comfort that they are special because they are part of a privileged and restricted community, not because they have accomplished exceptional work.

For every gold medal awarded in science to highly deserving individuals, there are many equally deserving individuals who have not been so honored. Medals and prizes enhance our individual and collective credibility in the broader community, just as the Olympics increase the public interest in many relatively obscure sports like luge or curling. But we should always value the athletes who compete for the joy of their sport, and the many thousands of our colleagues who work in science to participate in the joy of discovery who will never be medalists but who, nonetheless, are heroes."

To the extent to which departments and universities are both visionary and rigorous, they will succeed in appointing and retaining people of diverse skills, interested in exploring a wide variety of problems. The dangers of linear assessments of accomplishments, as done in the pole vault, are that we run the risk of narrowing our sense of what achievement in science means and, as a result, narrowing the kinds of experiments that are done to those that can be evaluated by an overly simple (if easily understood) metric."
