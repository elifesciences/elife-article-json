However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms at the molecular, cellular and network levels. Using local field potential recording in awake behaving mice and concomitant field potential and whole-cell recordings in slice preparations we found that gamma rhythms lead to activity-dependent modification of hippocampal networks, including alterations in sharp wave-ripple complexes. Network plasticity, expressed as long-lasting increases in sharp wave-associated synaptic currents, exhibits enhanced excitatory synaptic strength in pyramidal cells that is induced postsynaptically and depends on metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 activation. In sharp contrast, alteration of inhibitory synaptic strength is independent of postsynaptic activation and less pronounced. Further, we found a cell type-specific, directionally biased synaptic plasticity of two major types of GABAergic cells, parvalbumin- and cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons. Thus, we propose that gamma frequency oscillations represent a network state that introduces long-lasting synaptic plasticity in a cell-specific manner."

However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms at the molecular, cellular and network levels. Using local field potential recording in awake behaving mice and concomitant field potential and whole-cell recordings in slice preparations we found that gamma rhythms lead to activity-dependent modification of hippocampal networks, including alterations in sharp wave-ripple complexes. Network plasticity, expressed as long-lasting increases in sharp wave-associated synaptic currents, exhibits enhanced excitatory synaptic strength in pyramidal cells that is induced postsynaptically and depends on metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 activation. In sharp contrast, alteration of inhibitory synaptic strength is independent of postsynaptic activation and less pronounced. Further, we found a cell type-specific, directionally biased synaptic plasticity of two major types of GABAergic cells, parvalbumin- and cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons. Thus, we propose that gamma frequency oscillations represent a network state that introduces long-lasting synaptic plasticity in a cell-specific manner."

By recording the activity of excitatory neurons in mouse brain slices, Zarnadze, B\u00e4uerle et al. show that gamma oscillations increase the strength of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus, allowing neurons to signal more easily across these connections. Blocking the activity of a protein called metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 prevents this increase in excitatory synaptic strength, suggesting that these receptors play an important role in memory processing. In contrast to excitatory neurons, gamma oscillations have different effects on two types of inhibitory neurons within the hippocampus. The oscillations increase the excitability of gamma-supporting inhibitory neurons, but at the same time reduce that of gamma-disturbing inhibitory neurons. These opposing changes in turn support synaptic plasticity."

In contrast, CCK-expressing INs show a slower but variable discharge pattern and asynchronous GABA release (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Daw et al., 2009</a>). High expression of various receptors for neuromodulators (<a href=\"#bib24\">Freund, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Armstrong and Soltesz, 2012</a>) post- and presynaptically, suggests that these INs may regulate excitability in the network by mediating inhibition in a behavioral state-dependent manner."

We found that in vivo theta-nested gamma oscillations have an enhancing effect on subsequent SWRs in awake behaving mice. Analysis of the underlying molecular, cellular and synaptic mechanisms in vitro slice preparations showed changes in SWR-associated excitatory synaptic strength between pyramidal cells (PC) that are mediated postsynaptically and depend on metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 (mGluR5) activation. In stark contrast to excitation, alteration of inhibitory synaptic strength was independent of postsynaptic activation and less pronounced, reflecting an IN-specific, directionally biased synaptic plasticity, as demonstrated in our study for two major GABAergic inhibitory cell types, PV- and CCK-expressing INs. Our results suggest that gamma frequency oscillations represent a network state that promotes the formation of long-lasting synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal area CA3, leading to modification of synaptic strengths in a cell-specific manner."

Thus, we used prolonged running episodes, at an average of 3 min, (mean 3:06 \u00b1 0:32\u2009min, n = 11, 4 mice; range from 2:28 to 4:30\u2009min depending on the\u00a0actual\u00a0running performance), to investigate the interaction between the two network patterns. The impact of running-associated theta-nested gamma frequency oscillations on subsequent SWRs was evaluated by comparing the areas of SWRs in the two-minute time windows directly preceding and following a theta-nested gamma episode. The post-gamma SWR (p-SWR) areas exhibited significantly enlargement at an average of 25.7% (n = 11, p=0.0006, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and no significant change in frequency (SWR: 0.18 \u00b1 0.10\u2009Hz; p-SWR: 0.16 \u00b1 0.10\u2009Hz, n = 11, p=0.23). This result indicates an enhanced network activity and suggests a surprisingly direct effect of the running associated theta-nested gamma oscillations. But the fact that the internal state might not be fixed for an extended time period hampered conclusive interpretation of this result. In particular, the altered p-SWR could also reflect a change of the animals internal state including the contribution of a different set of cell assembles (<a href=\"#bib12\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 2015</a>), which is difficult to control in vivo.

In good agreement with our in vivo results, SWRs and gamma frequency oscillation patterns represented two \u2018competing\u2019, mutually exclusive network states in vitro: spontaneously occurring SWRs (mean frequency: 1.33 \u00b1 0.10\u2009Hz, n = 30) disappeared shortly (31.0 \u00b1 2.8\u2009s) after bath application of kainic acid (KA, 400 nM) and reappeared within a few minutes (14.6 \u00b1 0.7\u2009min) after KA washout (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). However, also in line with our in vivo data, the two network patterns were not fully independent \u2013 plastic changes initiated in the network by means of persistent gamma activity altered the subsequent SWR pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>). The p-SWRs exhibited a significantly increased area (by 69.7 \u00b1 15.1%, n = 30, p&lt;0.0001, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and a small decrease in incidence (to 0.90 \u00b1 0.10\u2009Hz, n = 30, p&lt;0.0001). In addition, we found a slight but significant increase in average ripple number (by 8.5 \u00b1 2.5%, n = 12, p=0.0065) and an elevated oscillatory ripple frequency (by 4.1 \u00b1 1.8%, n = 12, p=0.041). These changes were accompanied by a significant increase of post-gamma sharp wave amplitude (by 44.6 \u00b1 19.3%, n = 12, p=0.042) and a non-significantly altered sharp wave duration (increased by 2.5 \u00b1 2.9%, n = 12, p=0.41). In good agreement with these data, gamma oscillations induced by bath application of carbachol (20 \u00b5M), an alternative drug to trigger persistent gamma oscillations based on a different mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fisahn et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hajos et al., 2004</a>), also resulted in a significant increase in SWR area (by 21.0 \u00b1 4.2%, n = 16, p=0.0002, see also <a href=\"#bib56\">Zylla et al., 2013</a>), indicating that gamma activity itself, and not the pharmacological agent, is responsible for the network alterations. Moreover, we found a highly significant positive correlation of the network gamma oscillations (power\u00d7duration) with the SWR-area increase (R = 0.58, n = 30, p=0.0007) and no correlation with the SWR incidence (R = \u22120.28, n = 30, p=0.14). In line with this, in a few cases where KA application failed to introduce gamma frequency oscillations, no changes in SWR-area were observed (reduction by 6.0 \u00b1 19.4%, n = 8, p=0.35). Notably, in comparison to KA, carbachol-triggered gamma oscillations exhibited less spectral power (p=0.007) and accordingly induced smaller SWR area changes (p=0.02), suggesting an activity-dependent mechanism of oscillation-induced neuronal network plasticity. Furthermore, we also found a reinforcing effect of gamma rhythms on subsequent gamma episodes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Together, these results emphasize the general potential of gamma oscillations to modify network activities."

Fast-spiking PV-positive cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) showed strong potentiation of EPSCs (increased by 89.8 \u00b1 20.2%, n = 12, p=0.0010), whereas IPCSs decreased slightly but significantly (n = 5, p=0.038, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Our data are well in line with a recent publication (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bittner et al., 2015</a>) demonstrating that the induction of new place-fields initiated during active running results in altered neuronal activity during subsequent SWRs. While the oscillatory theta component does not seem to be essential for the induction of plastic changes in the hippocampus in vivo (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brandon et al., 2014</a>), gamma rhythms are thought to constitute time windows of synchronized neural activity that promote spike-time-dependent synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Axmacher et al., 2006</a>) and enhance signal transmission (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sohal et al., 2009</a>). In line with this, our in vitro results clearly demonstrate that a gamma frequency episode significantly affects subsequent network activities including gamma oscillations and SWRs. The gamma activity-induced effect (SWR area increase) was independent of the pharmacologic agent (KA <i>vs.</i> carbachol) used for their induction, but did correlate with the presence and power of gamma frequency oscillations. Indeed, activity dependent increase of SWR amplitude was shown by high-frequency electrical stimulation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Behrens et al., 2005</a>). Thus, our results provide comprehensive data that the gamma oscillations and not the pharmacologic agents themselves (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zylla et al., 2013</a>) are responsible for the observed network plasticity."

However, crucially, the latter publications and similar studies on hippocampal neuronal plasticity have certain methodological limitations. First, they were usually elicited by high-frequency electrical stimulation of neurons providing afferent input, whereas the predominant firing rate of CA3 PCs and their afferent neurons in vivo is far less frequent (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hahn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jung and McNaughton, 1993</a>). Second, electrical stimulation was usually limited to one of these inputs, whereas, in the intact hippocampal network, individual inputs do not act in isolation, but converge onto postsynaptic cells. Thus, during physiological activity patterns, such as gamma frequency oscillations, different inputs to CA3 PCs may act synergistically, with their joint activity resulting in a specific alteration of synaptic strength. Consequently, the here investigated oscillatory pattern might constitute a more physiological paradigm that can elucidate network-dependent mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. With our approach, we reveal a unique role of gamma frequency oscillations in activity-dependent modification of hippocampal network. Our results highlight this oscillatory network rhythm as a fundamental mechanism to induce synaptic plasticity and a potential primary driving force for memory processing. Nevertheless, the specific role of an individual input for gamma-dependent plasticity in hippocampal network remains to be clarified."

However, these two network patterns are not fully independent: plastic changes initiated in the network during persistent gamma activity were reflected in a subsequent altered SWR activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Consistent with the here observed tight link of gamma oscillations and SWR activity, sleep-dependent memory consolidation is associated with increased gamma activity (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ognjanovski et al., 2014</a>) and cells active during exploratory behavior exhibit enhanced SWR-associated EPSCs in subsequent slice preparations (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mizunuma et al., 2014</a>)."

The effect can only partially be explained by NMDAR-modulation, with mGluR5 obviously exerting a more complex impact on the neuronal network dynamics, affecting both PC and IN activity. Interestingly, dysregulation of mGluR5 has been reported in several profound neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia (<a href=\"#bib16\">Conn et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nickols and Conn, 2014</a>), autistic spectrum disorders (<a href=\"#bib53\">Williams, 2012</a>) and fragile X syndrome (<a href=\"#bib40\">Michalon et al., 2012</a>), altogether pointing towards a pivotal regulatory function for this receptor.

These differences could be explained by a cell-specific, directionally biased synaptic plasticity at PC-IN and IN-IN synapses as demonstrated for two major types of GABAergic inhibitory cells, PV- and CCK-expressing INs. Gamma network oscillations alter synaptic strength within PV-expressing INs in favor of excitation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alle et al., 2001</a>), while CCK-expressing INs are subject to stronger inhibition, as demonstrated by the EPSC-to-IPSC ratio analysis. Importantly, inhibition provided by these two types of GABAergic cells is not uniform. Fast-spiking PV-expressing\u00a0INs mediate a rapid, phasic-form of inhibition, which contributes to the precise timing of neuronal synchronization and emergence of network oscillations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gloveli et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sohal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Schlingloff et al., 2014</a>).

Thus, the two IN types mediate distinct forms of inhibition and could contribute differentially to cortical network activity. Our data now suggest that divergent forms of synaptic plasticity observed in these two IN types could result in a reduced tonic but increased phasic inhibition onto PC. These changes in turn might lead to enhanced network excitability and promote synaptic plasticity within the cortical circuits."

To investigate the impact of a theta-nested gamma episode on SWRs we first waited for a prolonged resting period with a quietly sitting mouse on the spherical treadmill allowing us to record spontaneous SWR activity. Then, once the mouse had begun to move independently, a pressurized air stream was applied to the bottom of the Styrofoam ball, resulting in a smooth ball rotation that encouraged a running behavior accompanied by theta-nested gamma oscillations. If the mouse stopped running and began to balance the air-supported ball instead, we accelerated the ball slightly until running behavior was restored, maintaining an activity phase around 3 min in total depending on the actual running performance. Turning off the air pressure usually terminated the running behavior and initiated another resting period, once again accompanied by spontaneous occurring SWRs. In order to reduce the stress level while maintaining the attentional component, some dummy runs were performed prior to the final recording session."

We compared the SWR areas of two time periods (120\u00a0s each) ending 10\u00a0s before and starting 30\u00a0s after the prolonged running episode. LFP recordings were divided into a sharp wave (filtered 2\u201350\u00a0Hz) and a ripple (filtered 100-300\u00a0Hz) trace. We used the ripple trace to automatically preselect SWRs based on a voltage and a spectral threshold criterion. In detail, we first used a voltage threshold (mean plus six standard deviations of event-free recording) for a primary selection of individual ripples and grouped adjacent single ripples to a ripple event. We then took 70\u00a0ms cutouts of the event-free recording preceding those ripple events and calculated each maximum absolute wavelet coefficients of the complex Morlet wavelet transform (27 wavelet scales, 20 kHz sampling rate). We used the mean plus one standard deviation of this distribution as a spectral threshold criterion and discarded all ripple events, in which the maximum absolute wavelet coefficient did not exceed the threshold value. The preceding and subsequent local minima in the sharp wave trace were used to automatically identify SWR start and end points. However, the bandpass (2\u201350\u00a0Hz) filtered in vivo sharp\u00a0wave\u00a0trace still exhibited a remarkable variation, leading to incorrect boundaries in some cases. Consequently, the sharp wave, ripple and original recording traces were scrutinized by eye (<a href=\"#bib23\">Forro et al., 2015</a>). We rejected erroneously detected SWRs and manually adjusted the automatically identified start and end points if required. Finally, the SWR area was defined in the sharp wave trace as the area beneath the curve enclosed by those start and end points. However, comparing the uncorrected automatically identified SWRs we also obtained a statistically significant difference. Spectral power densitiy of gamma frequency oscillations were determined with an Welch algorithms (pwelch) and the complex Morlet wavelet transform (cmor2-1) was used to display SWR (bandpass filter 100\u2013300\u2009Hz, 134 wavelet scales, 20 kHz sampling rate)."

In order to follow the Hebbian plasticity rules, during gamma frequency oscillations, cells were recorded in current-clamp mode enabling them to generate action potentials. In an additional set of experiments, the PCs were held in voltage-clamp mode at \u221270 mV during gamma activity to prevent their depolarization. Whole-cell recording pipettes (3\u20135 M\u03a9) were filled with a solution containing (in mM): K-gluconate, 135; KCl, 5; ATP-Mg, 2; GTP-Na, 0.3; HEPES, 10; plus biocytin, 0.5% (pH 7.4 and 290 mOsm).

The holding potential in voltage-clamp mode was either \u221270 mV or 0 mV to record the EPSCs and IPSCs, respectively. The areas under curve were calculated for EPSCs and IPSCs and the EPSC-to-IPSC ratios were determined. The seal resistance before establishing whole-cell mode was \u22652 G\u03a9. The series resistance (range 12\u201318 M\u03a9) was not compensated, but was repeatedly monitored during the experiment by measuring the amplitude of the capacitive current in response to a \u221210 mV pulse.

It further shows that network oscillations increase the strength of excitatory synaptic inputs which in turn lead to changes in sharp wave ripple complexes (SWRs). The group I metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and NMDA receptors are involved in this form of synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, excitatory inputs onto PV-expressing interneurons are enhanced but not the ones onto CCK cells suggesting an interneuron type-specific effect."

We first analyzed the impact of gamma oscillations on the SWR area (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and frequency as suggested. We used the oscillatory power and the duration of network gamma oscillations (power\u00d7duration) to characterize the correlation of the SWR-area increase with the presence and power of gamma episodes. Indeed, we found a highly significant correlation of this parameter with the SWR-area change, well in line with our hypothesis of an activity-dependent mechanism. There was a negative, albeit not significant correlation coefficient, to the incidence of SWRs. We adjusted the main text accordingly (see Results section)."

We found a significant increase of post-gamma sharp wave amplitude together with a virtually unchanged duration. Furthermore, there was a slight increase in the average number of ripples per sharp wave and an elevated oscillatory ripple frequency (see Results section)."
