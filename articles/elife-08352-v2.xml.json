We demonstrate that conditional deletion of the DYT1 dystonia protein torsinA in embryonic progenitors of forebrain cholinergic and GABAergic neurons causes dystonic-like twisting movements that emerge during juvenile CNS maturation. The onset of these movements coincides with selective degeneration of dorsal striatal large cholinergic interneurons (LCI), and surviving LCI exhibit morphological, electrophysiological, and connectivity abnormalities. Consistent with the importance of this LCI pathology, murine dystonic-like movements are reduced significantly with an antimuscarinic agent used clinically, and we identify cholinergic abnormalities in postmortem striatal tissue from DYT1 dystonia patients. These findings demonstrate that dorsal LCI have a unique requirement for torsinA function during striatal maturation, and link abnormalities of these cells to dystonic-like movements in an overtly symptomatic animal model."

We demonstrate that conditional deletion of the DYT1 dystonia protein torsinA in embryonic progenitors of forebrain cholinergic and GABAergic neurons causes dystonic-like twisting movements that emerge during juvenile CNS maturation. The onset of these movements coincides with selective degeneration of dorsal striatal large cholinergic interneurons (LCI), and surviving LCI exhibit morphological, electrophysiological, and connectivity abnormalities. Consistent with the importance of this LCI pathology, murine dystonic-like movements are reduced significantly with an antimuscarinic agent used clinically, and we identify cholinergic abnormalities in postmortem striatal tissue from DYT1 dystonia patients. These findings demonstrate that dorsal LCI have a unique requirement for torsinA function during striatal maturation, and link abnormalities of these cells to dystonic-like movements in an overtly symptomatic animal model."

The most common view among researchers is that dystonia is caused by abnormal activity in an otherwise structurally normal nervous system. But, recent findings indicate that the degeneration of small populations of nerve cells in the brain may be important. The striatum is made up of several different types of nerve cells, but it is poorly understood which of these are affected in dystonia."

Like people with dystonia, these mice developed the abnormal movements as juveniles, and the movements were suppressed with \u2018anti-cholinergic\u2019 medications.

DYT1 dystonia is caused by a dominantly inherited mutation of the <i>TOR1A</i> gene that impairs function of the encoded protein torsinA. TorsinA is an endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope-localized AAA+ ATPase (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ozelius et al., 1997</a>) implicated in protein quality control and nuclear membrane-localized functions (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib10\">Dauer (2014)</a>). Heterozygous <i>Tor1a</i><sup><i>\u0394E/+</i></sup> mice (mimicking the human DYT1 genotype) do not exhibit any overt abnormalities, while constitutive <i>Tor1a</i> knockout and homozygous \u0394E knock-in mice both exhibit perinatal lethality (<a href=\"#bib16\">Goodchild et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tanabe et al., 2012</a>). Transgenic mice overexpressing wild type or mutant torsinA do not exhibit overt motor abnormalities (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sharma et al., 2005</a>), but are used to explore striatal electrophysiological abnormalities linked to overexpression of mutant torsinA. These studies demonstrate that in DYT1 mutant transgenics, striatal large cholinergic interneurons (LCI) exhibit a paradoxical response to dopamine D2 receptor agonists that may be involved in abnormalities of corticostriatal plasticity (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pisani et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Martella et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sciamanna et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Grundmann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sciamanna et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2012b</a>).

Overt twisting movements are only observed in DYT1 model mice where torsinA function is impaired in precursor cells giving rise to multiple neuronal cell types (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liang et al., 2014</a>). These results implicate the importance of developmental timing of torsinA loss of function and the potential involvement of multiple dysfunctional cell types in disease pathophysiology.

This model exhibits face, construct and predictive validity. These mice are initially normal, but exhibit overt motor deficits as juveniles, coincident with selective loss of striatal LCIs and related electrophysiological abnormalities. Similar to DYT1 patients, the abnormal twisting and clasping movements of these mice are reduced significantly with chronic antimuscarinic administration. Moreover, we identify cholinergic abnormalities in postmortem putamen from DYT1 subjects. These observations are the first to demonstrate the unique vulnerability of a specific striatal cell type to torsinA loss of function, and have important implications for the understanding of disease pathogenesis and the development of targeted therapeutics."

We assessed motor function during gait and during tail suspension, when mice vigorously kick their limbs and attempt to attain an upright body posture. Gait analysis was largely unremarkable (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Dlx-CKO mice exhibited normal behavior during tail suspension up to 14 days of age, but nearly 100% of the animals developed severe forelimb and hindlimb clasping behaviors beginning at 15\u201317 days of age (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). This abnormal behavior remained fixed for the duration of the animal's life, to at least 1 year of age (17 out of 18 Dlx-CKO mice clasped during tail suspension at 1 year). A subset of these mutants simultaneously developed severe abnormal twisting of the trunk (\u223c70% of mice; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Dlx-CKO mice also developed a defect in the ability to hang from a wire grid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>, upper panel) that in some cases appeared related to abnormal hindpaw twisting. In contrast, motor learning and gross coordination appeared normal, as assessed by the ability to remain on an accelerating rotarod at 8 weeks of age (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>, lower panel). Dlx-CKO mice are also significantly hyperactive in the open field (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These observations demonstrate that torsinA loss of function in forebrain GABAergic and cholinergic neurons is sufficient to cause action-induced abnormal twisting movements. The onset of these abnormal movements during juvenile CNS maturation and their persistence into adulthood broadly resembles the natural history and symptomatology of DYT1 dystonia (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dauer, 2014</a>)."

Dlx-CKO mice were treated with once-daily injections of the antimuscarinic scopolamine (5 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline for 10 days. The duration of forelimb clasping, hindlimb clasping, and trunk twisting (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) was assessed on videos by blinded observers.

The symptomatic improvement appeared to depend on the continued presence of scopolamine, as behavioral benefit disappeared following a 3-week washout period.

A subpopulation of Dlx-CKO LCIs displayed very large responses (&gt;150 pA at 0.06 mA, 3/12) that were not observed in control LCIs. LCIs exhibiting large amplitude responses also had significantly larger membrane capacitances than cells that did not (134.8 \u00b1 14.7 vs 97.0 \u00b1 8.3 pF, p = 0.047), suggesting that increased numbers of synapses on the larger somata may account for the increased response amplitude. In support of this possibility, current density measurements of evoked responses (evoked response amplitude divided by cell capacitance) were not significantly different at all stimulation intensities (data not shown). These multiple disturbances of surviving LCIs function raise the possibility that the beneficial effect of anticholinergic agents may in part arise from suppressing their aberrant signaling."

We further explored this possibility by analyzing postmortem putamen from DYT1 subjects and controls. As DYT1 tissue is in very limited supply and in general not of sufficient quality to perform valid quantification of cell numbers, we analyzed whole cell lysates of this tissue for cholinergic (TrkA, VAChT and AChE), GABAergic (GAD67), and dopaminergic (TH) markers (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). TrkA levels were significantly reduced in DYT1 putamen (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>; approximately 84% reduction). Similarly, the normalized mean expression levels of VAChT and AChE were reduced by 66% and 50% respectively (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>), but these differences did not reach statistical significance, likely because of the large variability between control subjects for these markers. There was also considerable variability in the expression levels of the biosynthetic enzymes for ACh, GABA, and dopamine. Mean ChAT expression levels were slightly higher in DYT1 patients as compared to control subjects (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,D</a>). GAD67 and TH levels were comparable between control and DYT1 dystonia subjects (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>). Consistent with our experimental studies, these results suggest dysregulation of cholinergic function and TrkA signaling in the putamen of DYT1 dystonia patients."

This model incorporates several features believed essential for disease pathogenesis, including torsinA loss of function and targeting of forebrain motor circuitry including GABAergic and cholinergic neurons. Similar to the natural history and therapeutic response of the human disease, Dlx-CKO mice develop overt, dystonic-like twisting movements during juvenile CNS maturation that are reduced significantly with antimuscarinic drugs. The onset of abnormal movements coincides with a selective degeneration of striatal LCIs. Dlx-CKO mice are one of a small number of DYT1 mutant mouse models that exhibit overtly abnormal twisting movements (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liang et al., 2014</a>), all of which exhibit loss of discrete populations of neurons critical for motor function. Clasping and twisting during tail suspension is observed in models of many neurological diseases, so are unlikely to be equivalent to dystonia. Nevertheless, this abnormal behavior is an overt manifestation of abnormal motor function linked to cell loss in Dlx-CKO and other symptomatic dystonia models (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liang et al., 2014</a>). This is the first demonstration of selective vulnerability of a striatal cell type to torsinA loss of function, findings supported by studies in postmortem putamen from DYT1 dystonia subjects. Our observations add to an emerging literature implicating CNS maturation-related vulnerability of discrete cell types in the pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia, a disease mechanism with potentially important implications for future approaches to therapy."

LCIs are the first striatal neurons to become post-mitotic (<a href=\"#bib38\">Phelps et al., 1989</a>), and cholinergic signaling is believed to have important but poorly understood influences on the development of later-born striatal neurons (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chesselet et al., 2007</a>). In contrast to our findings using the <i>Dlx5/6-Cre</i> transgene, which is active prior to these events (in progenitor cells), <i>postnatal</i> conditional deletion of <i>Tor1a</i> in cholinergic neurons does not cause overt abnormal movements or changes in striatal LCI number, morphology, and neurochemistry (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sciamanna et al., 2012a</a>). Consistent with an important role for timing of deletion, <i>germline</i> heterozygous \u0394E <i>Tor1a</i> knock-in mice exhibit increased LCI cell body area, though these mutants show no difference in the number of LCIs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Song et al., 2013</a>). Mice may require more marked torsinA loss of function to fully model cholinergic vulnerability, as the heterozygous \u0394E <i>Tor1a</i> knock-in mice retain considerable torsinA function, and do not exhibit overt abnormal movements (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tanabe et al., 2012</a>). It is possible that non-cholinergic neuron populations in Dlx-CKO mice appear morphologically normal but exhibit functional abnormalities. However, conditional deletion of torsinA in MSNs, which constitute 95% of all striatal neurons, does not cause overt abnormal movements (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yokoi et al., 2011</a>)."

Neuroimaging studies increasingly point to changes potentially consistent with cell loss (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib41\">Ramdhani and Simonyan (2013)</a>). Our studies in postmortem striatum from DYT1 subjects, the first to examine cell type-specific markers in this context, are consistent with our experimental findings pointing to selective cholinergic defect in this structure. Previous work in overtly symptomatic DYT1 models demonstrates loss of discrete cell types in other motor-related structures (e.g., loss of neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei, with preservation of all other cerebellar cell types (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liang et al., 2014</a>). Our analysis of postmortem tissue was restricted to the striatum; future work is required to determine whether there is cell loss in extra-striatal areas corresponding to those identified in murine models. Postmortem analyses of DYT1 subjects suggests the presence of inclusion bodies in pedunculopontine cholinergic neurons, but did not report cell loss (<a href=\"#bib31\">McNaught et al., 2004</a>). These observations, and additional work (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liang et al., 2014</a>) and reviewed by <a href=\"#bib10\">Dauer (2014)</a>, suggest that abnormal protein quality control may represent a pathogenic event in DYT1 dystonia."

Furthermore, imaging studies of idiopathic cervical dystonia subjects suggest deficits in the density of striatal cholinergic axon terminals (<a href=\"#bib1a\">Albin et al., 2003</a>). LCIs innervate fast-spiking interneurons (<a href=\"#bib25\">Koos and Tepper, 2002</a>), a cell type concentrated in the lateral striatal areas (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berke, 2011</a>) where LCI loss is greatest in Dlx-CKO mice. Fast-spiking interneurons contribute to action execution and suppression of unwanted movements (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gage et al., 2010</a>), and have been implicated in dystonic-like postures (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gittis et al., 2011</a>)."

Abnormal clasping is present in a transgenic rat model of dystonia, but it is not known if striatal LCI number is reduced in these animals (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grundmann et al., 2012</a>). Loss of cholinergic neurons may be required for the remaining cells to become interconnected into an abnormal circuit. Recordings in striatal slices performed after maximal cell loss in Dlx-CKO mice demonstrate that surviving LCIs develop a complex set of intrinsic membrane and synaptic alterations. Dlx-CKO LCIs are less excitable when depolarized by intracellular current injections, yet display significantly larger evoked EPSCs, potentially reflecting increased excitatory synapses on the surviving (larger) neurons. Dlx-CKO LCIs also receive significantly enhanced inhibitory synaptic that could lead to aberrant firing when cells are challenged, as we have demonstrated in a related movement disorder, Huntington's chorea (<a href=\"#bib21\">Holley et al., 2015</a>). These multiple disturbances of surviving LCIs function raise the possibility that the beneficial effect of anticholinergic agents may in part arise from suppressing aberrant LCI signaling."

Cells within the outlined region were counted using a 63\u00d7 oil immersion objective, with a 12 \u03bcm counting depth, and 1 \u03bcm guard zones. Counting frame and sampling grid sizes were determined in pilot studies such that the Gunderson coefficient of error was less than 0.1 for each marker in each brain region (see <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> for specific counting frame and grid sizes). The top of each stained cell body was the point of reference. The corpus callosum, anterior commissure, lateral ventricle, and globus pallidus were used as anatomical boundaries for the striatum.

Frozen putamen samples from three control subjects stored at the Michigan Brain Bank were obtained from Dr Roger Albin. Subjects were chosen to control for age, sex, and postmortem interval (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Small putamen samples were taken with a razor blade, avoiding white matter tracts, and homogenates were prepared as described above for mouse striatum tissue. 10 \u00b5g protein lysates were run on 4\u201320% Biorad gels Mini Protean TGX precast polyacrylamide gels, were transferred to PVDF membranes, and were stained as described above (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> for antibody details). Bands were visualized using Supersignal West Pico, Dura, or Femto enhanced chemiluminescence substrates, underwent several exposures to Amersham hyperfilm ECL, and were developed and fixed with an x-ray film developer."

In this model, they encountered dysfunction and loss selectively in LCI following a specific topographic gradient. This pathology was paralleled by the appearance of a specific motor phenotype in mice. Subsequently, they found evidence in human necropsy tissue consistent with this finding (but not conclusive). Overall, the questions asked in this work are significant and relevant to human disease, the article is very well written and the experiments were carried out in a logical order and generated convincing results, with appropriate controls and analysis. The findings represent a significant advance in the understanding of neuronal network in the striatum that control motor activities. This article will be of great interest to the large community of scientists interested on the study of the basal ganglia, and specifically to those focused on dystonia research.

As noted above, we are currently pursuing studies in defined vulnerable and invulnerable cell types to address this question. Our understanding of the cellular role of torsinA is still quite limited, but abnormal protein quality control of a molecule particularly important to LCI is one possibility. TorsinA appears to play a role in protein quality control in the ER. To hint at this possibility, our revised manuscript now states, in the Discussion, that \u201cpostmortem analyses of DYT1 subjects suggests the presence of inclusion bodies in pedunculopontine cholinergic neurons, but did not report cell loss (<a href=\"#bib31\">McNaught et al., 2004</a>; #3647).

This timing coincides with the period of striatal circuit maturation when afferent connections are established and projection neurons and interneurons become physiologically active and mature (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hattori and McGeer, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tepper et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lee and Sawatari, 2011</a>). Our working hypothesis is that this period of circuit maturation represents an important critical period for torsinA function. This is also suggested by previous models. We inserted the following statement into the Discussion to address this important point: \u201cPrevious torsinA loss-of-function models also demonstrate cell loss restricted to a neurodevelopmental window (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liang et al., 2014</a>). [\u2026] cell loss and behavior onset during a neurodevelopmental window periods is consistent with a critical period for torsinA function in CNS development.\u201d"
