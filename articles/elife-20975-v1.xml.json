                    "text": "Serotonin (5-HT) is associated with mood and motivation but the function of endogenous 5-HT remains controversial. Here, we studied the impact of phasic optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons in mice over time scales from seconds to weeks. We found that activating dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons induced a strong suppression of spontaneous locomotor behavior in the open field with rapid kinetics (onset \u22641 s). Inhibition of locomotion was independent of measures of anxiety or motor impairment and could be overcome by strong motivational drive. Repetitive place-contingent pairing of activation caused neither place preference nor aversion. However, repeated 15 min daily stimulation caused a persistent increase in spontaneous locomotion to emerge over three weeks. These results show that 5-HT transients have strong and opposing short and long-term effects on motor behavior that appear to arise from effects on the underlying factors that motivate actions."

Here, we studied the impact of phasic optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons in mice over time scales from seconds to weeks. We found that activating dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons induced a strong suppression of spontaneous locomotor behavior in the open field with rapid kinetics (onset \u22641 s). Inhibition of locomotion was independent of measures of anxiety or motor impairment and could be overcome by strong motivational drive. Repetitive place-contingent pairing of activation caused neither place preference nor aversion. However, repeated 15 min daily stimulation caused a persistent increase in spontaneous locomotion to emerge over three weeks. These results show that 5-HT transients have strong and opposing short and long-term effects on motor behavior that appear to arise from effects on the underlying factors that motivate actions."

A chemical called serotonin plays an important role in controlling these behaviors as it regulates the activity of nerve cells (known as neurons) throughout the brain. Serotonin is produced by a specific group of neurons found in an area at the base of the brain called the raphe nuclei. From there, serotonin is released into other parts of the brain to influence different behaviors. Although drugs that target serotonin are widely used as antidepressants, how this chemical signal acts in the brain remains a mystery. This is due, in part, to it being technically challenging to carry out experiments on the serotonin-producing neurons."

Here, Correia, Lottem et al. use optogenetics to activate serotonin-producing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of mice. The experiments show that triggering serotonin production for a few seconds causes the mice to move around more slowly as they explore their surroundings. This short-term release of serotonin only slows the mice down if they are not already occupied with other activities, such as finding water or balancing on a moving object. These experiments suggest that serotonin decreases an individual\u2019s motivation to move but that this can be overcome by sufficiently powerful goals. In contrast, repeatedly activating the serotonin neurons over a period of several weeks led to long-term changes of the opposite kind \u2013 the mice begin to move around more quickly."

However, the dominant conception of the 5-HT system still places mood and affect in a central position and considers other actions as side effects. To some degree different behavioral effects have been mapped to specific subsets of the 17-member receptor family, but a coherent pharmacologically-grounded theory of 5-HT function centered on affective states has been elusive (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dayan and Huys, 2009</a>)."

It is now known that, like other neuromodulatory neurons, 5-HT neurons exhibit phasic bursts of firing locked to significant behavioral events, such as stimuli, movements and rewards (<a href=\"#bib67\">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Nakamura et al., 2008</a>).

Opposite functions for phasic and tonic 5-HT have been proposed as well (<a href=\"#bib19\">Daw et al., 2002</a>), but little is in fact known about the effects of phasic 5-HT firing. Optogenetic manipulations, which afford both genetic specificity and temporal control, might access phasic effects that are inaccessible by pharmacological manipulation (e.g., <a href=\"#bib75\">Tsai et al., 2009</a>)."

Our starting point was experiments in the open field arena, a widely used assay for spontaneous behavior (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hall, 1934</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Seibenhener and Wooten, 2015</a>). A long-standing theory of 5-HT suggests that it is a mediator of \u2018behavioral inhibition\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib73\">Soubri\u00e9, 1986</a>). This theory was motivated by data showing that 5-HT depletion increases startle responses (<a href=\"#bib17\">Davis and Sheard, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Davis et al., 1980</a>) and locomotor activity (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gately et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Eagle et al., 2009</a>). On the other hand, it has also been theorized, largely based on recordings of 5-HT neurons, that the primary function of the 5-HT system is instead the facilitation of rhythmic motor behaviors (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jacobs and Fornal, 1993</a>). We found that phasic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons caused a rapid and striking decrease in locomotion, an\u00a0effect\u00a0of order 50%, while sparing other behaviors such as grooming."

Surprisingly, in this assay we saw no effect of 5-HT activation, arguing against a motor hypothesis and suggesting a higher level underlying cause leading to motor effects. Indeed, 5-HT is strongly implicated in the control of impulsivity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dalley and Roiser, 2012</a>), suppressing actions because it helps avoiding future punishments (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dayan and Huys, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2009</a>) or obtaining delayed rewards (<a href=\"#bib57\">Miyazaki et al., 2011a</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib58\">2011b</a>, <a href=\"#bib59\">2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib60\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Fonseca et al., 2015</a>). In either case, serotonin is thought to drive behavioral inhibition by altering the impact of the future motivating outcome. Anxiety is a prominent motivation in the open field, and mice show strong center-avoidance or thigmotaxis (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib65\">Prut and Belzung (2003)</a>). Yet, we found effects on locomotion that were not accompanied by spatial biases and yielded no positive or negative effects on anxiety measures."

Conversely, 5-HT has also been proposed to signal reward (<a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). To test if phasic 5-HT encodes or modulates reward or punishment, we repeatedly paired phasic 5-HT stimulation with a specific location within the open field, but we found neither appetitive or aversive place preference learning. Instead we found that slowing of movement could masquerade as a place preference depending on how occupancy was assessed. These findings\u00a0support previous studies showing that DRN 5-HT activation does not itself cause reinforcement learning (<a href=\"#bib60\">Miyazaki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Fonseca et al., 2015</a>). Unexpectedly, however, we found that repeated daily phasic 5-HT activation resulted in a long-term enhancement of locomotion, an effect similar in magnitude to the transient effect but opposite in sign. This observation recalls the two-to-three week window for selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) therapeutic effects to develop (<a href=\"#bib47\">Machado-Vieira et al., 2010</a>) and studies linking 5-HT activation to plasticity (<a href=\"#bib70\">Santarelli et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008</a>)."

To characterize the effects of DRN 5-HT activation we first performed a video based ethological analysis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Choleris et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The most frequent behaviors observed in the open field were walking and rearing, with the remainder of time spent grooming, digging or otherwise awake but relatively stationary (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Scratching and jumping were observed very infrequently and were not further analyzed. DRN 5-HT activation induced a profound decrease in locomotion, (p=3.61 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22125</sup>, paired t-test, SERT-Cre mice, N\u00a0=\u00a015), <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) and a robust increase in the probability of the \u2018resting\u2019 state (p=4.75 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22123</sup>, paired t-test, SERT-Cre mice, N\u00a0=\u00a015), <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

The \u2018resting\u2019 state did not correspond to freezing, as the animals did not exhibit a crouching position and often continued to make small movements (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969</a>), sometimes accompanied by a lowering of the head (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). To summarize the dynamics of DRN 5-HT activation effects on behavioral state, we grouped the \u2018mobile\u2019 states (walking, jumping, rearing) and the relatively \u2018immobile\u2019 (resting, grooming, digging, scratching) and plotted their probability as a function of time relative to stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>). This showed that the onset of DRN 5-HT activation effects were very rapid, peaking within 2 s and returning to baseline within 5 s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>)."

Optogenetic activation occurred heterogeneously in space, as illustrated by the position traces for representative WT and SERT-Cre mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

We next examined whether these effects were specific to the state of the animal at the onset of stimulation. We first tested whether the effects depend on the prior speed of the animal by conditioning the speed plots by the pre-stimulation speed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). This conditioning procedure produces a tendency of the speed to revert back toward the mean, which can be seen even in non-stimulated blocks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2013I</a>). We therefore calculated the stimulation effect by subtracting speed values in equivalent non-stimulation blocks from values in the stimulation blocks ('delta\u00a0speed', <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). There were significant effects on the average delta speed (post-pre intervals) for all pre-stimulation speeds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>), as indicated by comparing delta speed between non-stimulated and stimulated trials across different speed quartiles (2-way ANOVA, stimulation, prior speed; SERT-Cre mice, N\u00a0=\u00a015; stimulation, F<sub>(1,110)</sub>=123, p=1.18 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22124</sup>; prior speed, F<sub>(3,110)</sub>=160, p=6.53 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221240</sup>; stimulation x prior speed F<sub>(3,110)</sub>=18.3, p=1.02 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22129</sup>), followed by paired t-tests, with Bonferroni correction (stimulation, p&lt;0.05; prior speed quartiles 1\u20132, n.s; other quartiles, p&lt;0.05). This analysis shows that decrease in speed produced by DRN 5-HT neuron activation was larger when the speed of the animal just prior to stimulation onset was faster. No significant changes were found for WT mice (data not shown, N\u00a0=\u00a09). This indicates that the effects of optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons were not limited to biasing animals against initiating movement, but also rapidly stopped mice even when they were already moving at relatively high speed."

After allowing 2\u20133 weeks for virus expression, mice were trained for two consecutive days on the rotarod and on the third day DRN 5-HT neurons were optogentically activated (5 mW, 10 ms, 490 nm light pulses at 25 Hz) in a randomly-selected 50% of trials, i.e. from placement of the mouse on the rotarod until the mouse fell (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a>).

Therefore we next studied a subset of mice using a linear track assay with high-speed videography, allowing tracking the trajectory of the four paws, nose and tail (LocoMouse system, <a href=\"#bib46\">Machado et al., 2015</a>). In this assay, mice cross back and forth in a narrow brightly-lit corridor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). Mice are motivated to cross the track by the tendency to avoid light and by water rewards they received at either side (mice were mildly water-restricted). DRN 5-HT optogenetic activation was delivered starting when the animal entered the track and until it reached the other end (stimulation parameters as in the rotarod assay). Surprisingly, despite the effects on locomotor behavior in the open field, we observed no effect of stimulation on speed, measured either as time to cross the track (p=0.446, paired t-test, SERT-Cre mice, N\u00a0=\u00a07, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) or the speed (p=0.387, paired t-test, SERT-Cre mice, N\u00a0=\u00a07, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), for the population of SERT-Cre mice.

However, this is secondary to the unanticipated finding that the primary effect on locomotor speed is highly context-dependent. This might be attributed to the strong drive to perform specific actions in those contexts. Therefore, we next turned to consider whether the effects on locomotion could be a consequence of specific affective or motivational states that might be induced by optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons. The open field assay has long been used as a screen for anxiety-related behavior in rodents (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bailey and Crawley, 2009</a>). Thigmotaxis, the tendency to remain close to the walls and avoid the center of the arena, is a widely used measure of anxiety with ethological face validity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Choleris et al., 2001</a>). If the observed locomotor effects were secondary to an increase (or decrease) in fear or anxiety they should be accompanied by changes in thigmotaxis or by more subtle interaction between location and stimulation effects."

Nevertheless, DRN 5-HT activation caused a robust decrease in speed regardless of the spatial area where the animal was located at stimulation onset (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>), as indicated by comparing speed between pre- and post-stimulation intervals across the different areas (2-way ANOVA, stimulation, areas; SERT-Cre mice, N\u00a0=\u00a015; stimulation, F<sub>(1,84)</sub>=250, p=2.58 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u221217</sup>; areas, F<sub>(2,84)</sub>=18.9, p=3.99 \u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22124</sup>; stimulation x areas, F<sub>(2,84)</sub>=8.58, p=0.0238).

Therefore the effects of phasic optogenetic activation of these neurons do not appear to result from attenuation or enhancement of anxiety insofar as that can be measured by center avoidance. However, they do not exclude the possibility of longer-term effects. For example, some important affective and motivational effects of the dopamine system build up over longer periods and require contingency with environmental events, such as the conditioned place preference that can be produced by stimulating dopamine neurons contingent on an animal being in a certain location (<a href=\"#bib54\">McDevitt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Tsai et al., 2009</a>).

The lack of change in rate of entries into the ROI despite the\u00a0strong increase in occupancy indicates that mice do not approach or avoid the ROI, contrary to what is expected from either appetitive or aversive reinforcement learning. Second, if ROI stimulation induced a place preference, the effects should persist after pairing (<a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). This was also not the case. ROI occupancy and rate of exits assayed on the day immediately after the pairing protocol returned to baseline levels (p&gt;0.05, post-hoc t-tests, with Bonferroni correction, comparing pre and post day, N\u00a0=\u00a04).

Activation of DRN 5-HT neurons appears to promote ROI occupancy due to a decrease in movement speed within the ROI, resulting in a decrease in the rate of ROI exits. Interestingly, however, there appeared to be an increase in the effect of stimulation across days, as indicated by the fact that ROI occupancy increase did not reach significance before the third day of stimulation. In addition, there was a decrease in speed within the ROI between the pre- and post-stimulation sessions (p&lt;0.05, post-hoc t-test, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>) that was not seen in WT mice (F<sub>(4,20)</sub>=0.183, p=0.945, 1-way ANOVA across days).

Such \u2018behavioral inhibition\u2019 has been studied extensively in tasks in which animals must refrain from responding for a delayed reward, including the five choice serial reaction time task (<a href=\"#bib33\">Harrison et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Winstanley et al., 2004b</a>), go/no-go tasks (<a href=\"#bib34\">Harrison et al., 1999</a>) and waiting tasks (<a href=\"#bib60\">Miyazaki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Fonseca et al., 2015</a>). The effects of 5-HT appear to be largest when forces for acting and refraining from acting are balanced (<a href=\"#bib73\">Soubri\u00e9, 1986</a>). In the open field, there are no overt rewards or punishments motivating behavior. One could infer from the dramatic effects of 5-HT in this context that a normally balanced set of covert factors is shifted toward inaction by 5-HT. Conversely, the lack of effect in linear track or rotorod could reflect the inability of 5-HT to overcome strong local drives present in these contexts (obtaining water rewards and avoiding exposure to bright light in the linear track; avoiding falling in the rotarod)."

While 5-HT affects reward waiting times it does not affect stimulus reaction times (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fonseca et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, while 5-HT appears to modulate goal-directed actions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bailey et al., 2016</a>) it might not affect habitual actions. Although this hypothesis remains speculative, it would be consistent with the observation of DRN 5-HT activation strongly affected behavior in the open field, in which stimuli-response habits are absent, but failed to affect behavior in the rotarod and linear track, both of which might have become stimulus-response habits. Further experiments would be required to test this."

These data do not reveal exactly how 5-HT achieves this, but do offer some constraints. 5-HT has been classically associated with anxiety and the thigmotaxis (center avoidance) in the open field has been widely used to assay anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib65\">Prut and Belzung, 2003</a>). 5-HT could increase the impact of threats that favor immobility over exploration. However, we observed no effects on thigmotaxis (center avoidance) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), indicating that movement speed effects are not consequences of effects of 5-HT on anxiety but rather direct and independent effects. Our findings are consistent with a recent study showing optogenetic activation of DRN 5-HT neurons decreases locomotor activity without affecting anxiety in the elevated plus maze test (<a href=\"#bib63\">Ohmura et al., 2014</a>). Another recent study observed a transient increase in speed in the open field with DRN stimulation (<a href=\"#bib81\">Warden et al., 2012</a>). However in that study, both 5-HT and GABAergic neurons in the DRN were targeted, raising the possibility that the protocol was effectively inhibiting DRN 5-HT neurons by driving GABAergic neurons. Two recent studies using pharmacogenetic methods reported an increase in thigmotaxis in the open field following activation of 5-HT neurons (<a href=\"#bib74\">Teissier et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Urban et al., 2016</a>), and one of them (<a href=\"#bib74\">Teissier et al., 2015</a>) also reported an overall reduction in locomotion. The additional effects observed could be due to the much slower kinetics of pharmacogenetic methods, which could result in a very different profile of 5-HT transmitter release. The anxiolytic effects of 5-HT appear to be mediated largely by 5-HT1a receptors. It is possible that Ohmura et al. and the present study did not observe these effects because they are not effectively activated by the optogenetic stimulation protocols employed. The 5-HT2a and 5-HT2c receptors have been associated with the effects of 5-HT on impulsivity (<a href=\"#bib82\">Winstanley et al., 2004a</a>) and would be candidates to underlie slowing in the open field effects as well."

The pathway-specific effects might therefore represent an \u2018off-target\u2019 effect of this pathway (<a href=\"#bib64\">Otchy et al., 2015</a>) that is not present when a larger portion of the DRN is stimulated, because, it is balanced by an opposite effect through a different DRN output pathway.

We did observe an increase in the occupancy during stimulated sessions, but this could be accounted by the decrease in speed within the ROI, consistent with inhibition of locomotion. Slowing was in turn associated with a decrease in rate of exits from the ROI. In contrast, we observed no change in the rate of entries into the ROI,\u00a0i.e., mice showed no evidence of increased tendency to approach or avoid the ROI after pairing. Furthermore, ROI occupancy returned to baseline when stimulation ceased. Thus, mice showed no evidence of learning about the ROI.

There remain a variety of possible underlying signals that might be reported by DRN 5-HT neurons and that could result in inhibition of locomotion. Broadly, these could be divided into three domains. A first set of proposals, developed largely in the domain of reinforcement learning theory, posits 5-HT to affect action selection and response vigor by biasing the value of appetitive or aversive stimuli (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dayan and Huys, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cools et al., 2011</a>). A second set of ideas posits a signal that modulates the cost of acting (or not-acting) itself (<a href=\"#bib60\">Miyazaki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Fonseca et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Meyniel et al., 2016</a>). A third set of ideas is related to the signaling of uncertainty, either in predicting events or the outcomes of ones own actions (<a href=\"#bib50\">Maswood et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amat et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Matias\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2016</a>). Uncertainty-related signals may be more complex to interpret as they could bias benefits and costs toward either action or inaction depending on the shape of the value landscape or could shift the balance between different behavioral control systems (<a href=\"#bib20\">Daw et al., 2005</a>)."

First, other neuromodulators, particularly dopamine and norepinephrine, are also implicated in the same functions (<a href=\"#bib87\">Yu and Dayan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Dayan and Yu, 2006</a>) and 5-HT has a variety of features that suggest it acts as an opponent to dopamine (<a href=\"#bib19\">Daw et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cools et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</a>). Our data are consistent with opponent effects of 5-HT and DA as modulators of action vigor, but not as reinforcement learning signals. Simultaneous or parallel recordings from multiple neuromodulator systems will be important for resolving the interplay between these systems (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Matias\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2016</a>). An additional complexity is that, due to differences in receptor kinetics, phasic firing and tonic firing of 5-HT neurons may convey different signals (<a href=\"#bib19\">Daw et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cools et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>). Because of the synchronous nature of optogenetic stimulation and the rapid onset of the transient effects, we presume that our protocol mimicked primarily phasic signaling, but we cannot exclude the possibility that it also mimics tonic signals as well. This issue may underlie some of the discrepancies between different pharmacological and optogenetic results. Finally, recordings from DRN 5-HT neurons have indicated substantial diversity in firing patterns (<a href=\"#bib61\">Nakamura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>).

These long-term effects were not observed in control animals that were exposed to the same tests but with stimulation withheld until after three weeks. The transient and long-term effects appeared to be opposites and interacted additively. Although further experiments will be needed to address mechanisms, this opponency suggests the possibility of a direct form of compensatory action at a physiological or biochemical level. If the effects of transient DRN 5-HT activation are interpreted as suppression of the influence of motivating factors on locomotion, as suggested above, the long-term effects could represent an enhanced influence of the same motivating factors. The ability of goals to motivate behavior is critical for healthy mental function, and its absence, apathy, is a clinically important factor in many psychiatric disorders (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chase, 2011</a>). Although our stimulation protocol was artificial, it was carried out at a rate within the physiological range of 5-HT neurons (<a href=\"#bib61\">Nakamura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>) and would likely\u00a0produce only a modest increase in overall DRN\u00a05-HT\u00a0activity.

Notably, SSRIs must be administered for several weeks before anti-depressant effects can be seen, suggesting that anti-depressant effects are not a direct and immediate consequence of changes in 5-HT function but the consequence of an adaptation requiring induction of plasticity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Branchi, 2011</a>) or neurogenesis (<a href=\"#bib56\">Miller and Hen, 2015</a>). The molecular and temporal specificity afforded by optogenetic access will facilitate the determination of the mechanism of action of the (short and) long-term effects of DRN 5-HT activation. For example, more refined targeting strategies, e.g. retrograde infection (<a href=\"#bib69\">Rothermel et al., 2013</a>) or intersectional genetics (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jensen et al., 2008</a>), will allow the determination of the pathways involved.

Lidocaine (2%) was injected subcutaneously before incising the scalp. The skull was covered with a layer of Super Bond C and B (Morita, Kyoto, Japan) to help stabilization of the implant. A craniotomy was drilled over lobule 4/5 of the cerebellum and a pipette filled with a viral solution (AAV2.9.EF1a.DIO.hChR2(H134R)-eYFP.WPRE.hGH, 10<sup>13</sup> GC/mL, University of Pennsylvania) was lowered to the DRN (Bregma \u22124.7 AP, \u22122.9 DV) with a 32\u201333\u00b0 angle toward the back of the animal. The viral solution (1 \u00b5L) was injected using a Picospritzer II (Parker) or an hydraulic pump (UMP3-1, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), connected to a 5 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV), at a rate of 0.05\u20130.1 \u00b5L/min. An optical fiber (200 \u03bcm core diameter, 0.48 NA, 4\u20135 mm) housed inside a connectorized implant (M3, Doric lenses, Quebec, Canada) was lowered into the brain, through the same craniotomy as the viral injection, and positioned 200 \u03bcm above the injection point. The implant was cemented to the skull using dental acrylic (Pi-Ku-Plast HP 36, Bredent, Senden, Germany). The skin was stitched at the front and rear of the implant. Mice were monitored until recovery from the surgery and returned to their home cage. Gentamicin (48760, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was topically applied around the implant. Behavioral testing started at least two weeks after virus injection to ensure good levels of expression. Previous studies using the same method reported that 94% of ChR2-YFP positive neurons were serotonergic, assessed with tryptophan hydroxylase immunohistochemistry (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dugu\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>)."

The AOM controlled the laser power without any auditory noise and it was triggered by the behavioral control system (Bcontrol), developed by Carlos Brody (Princeton University) in collaboration with Calin Culianu, Tony Zador (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) and Z.F.M. Light exiting the AOM was collected (KT110/M, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) into an optical fiber patchcord (200 \u03bcm, 0.22 NA, Doric lenses), connected to a second fiber patchcord through a rotary joint (FRJ 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01, Doric lenses), then to a chronically implanted optic fiber cannula through an M3 connector (Doric lenses). Laser power was calibrated using a powermeter (PM130D, Thorlabs) before and after each animal session. The optical fiber patchord was screwed to the M3 implanted connector at the beginning of each experiment."

Animals (3 SERT-Cre) were placed on the right-side box and allowed to freely walk across a glass corridor with a mirror below at 45\u00b0 angle. A single high-resolution, high-speed camera (Bonito CL-400B, Allied Vision Technologies) captured side and bottom views at 400 fps. Acquisition software was written in Labview and a National Instruments PCIe 1433 was\u00a0used\u00a0to record and save the movies in real time. Infrared sensors placed at the beginning and end of the corridor detected initiation and termination of each trial. The automatic triggering system allowed mice to self-initiate trials. Animals were water deprived in order to increase their motivation to run from one side to the other of the corridor. Water was delivered (4 \u03bcl) in all trials. Mice performed four sessions of 15\u201360 trials. An infrared LED was synchronized with the stimulation protocol and detection time was collected. Light stimulation (15 ms pulses, 25 Hz, 5 mW) happened in 50% of the trials (randomly assigned) and lasted the time it took the animal to cross the track.

The mobile states included walking (straight locomotor activity), rearing (mouse with both forepaws off the floor) and jumping (mouse with all four paws off the floor). The immobile states included resting (non-locomotor activity that did not include any of the other states), digging (mouse using the forepaws to move the bedding), grooming (rapid cleaning movements of the forepaws towards the face and/or the body) and scratching (very rapid and repeated up and down movements of the hind paws on the side of the body, neck or face)."

Briefly, the algorithm\u2019s output consisted in 3D trajectories (x,y,z) of the four paws, the snout, and the tail (separated into 15 points) along the trial. All tracks were visually examined and fewer than 10% of trails were removed due to exploratory behaviors. To quantify gait parameters, the trajectories of the individual paws where divided into stride cycles that are composed by swing and stance phase. All strides were sorted into speed bins (5 cm/s bin width) with a minimum of 5 strides per bin, per animal. The bin 15\u201320 cm/s was selected for presentation, as it included the higher number of trials, for both non-stimulated and stimulated trials."

Comparison between independent groups of mice (SERT-Cre vs. WT) was done with a two-sample t test (ttest2, MATLAB). To compare delta speed across quartiles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>), areas (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>) and blocks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) we performed a two-way ANOVA (anova2, MATLAB),followed by post-hoc t-tests with Bonferroni correction (multcompare, MATLAB). A two-way ANOVA was further used for comparison of between stimulated and non-stimulated trials across blocks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,J</a>) and the pre vs. post speed intervals across sessions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,E</a>). To compare between stimulated and non-stimulated trials in the polar plots of the LocoMouse task (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) we used a three-way ANOVA applied to a linear mixed model (as described in <a href=\"#bib46\">Machado et al., 2015</a>). The results were reported as conditional F tests with Satterthwaite degrees of freedom correction. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare ROI experiment parameters across days (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013G</a>), followed by post-hoc t-tests with Bonferroni correction (multcompare, MATLAB). For all the ANOVAs performed, when mice were included, they were considered as a random factor. Differences were considered significant at *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01 and ***p&lt;0.001, unless when Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied. To compare stim. and non-stim. distributions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>), we applied a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To assess whether increased photostimulation frequency affected movement speed in a dose-dependent manner we used a linear regression analysis, fitting delta speed as a function of frequency (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). To test for long-term effects of photostimulation on speed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) we considered the speed during a time window just before photostimulation (pre-stimulation, as defined previously). We regressed these values against session number and group identity according to the following equation:"

The hypothesis being tested is that the short-term slowing effect on day n (<i>speed<sub>post</sub>(n)</i> - <i>speed<sub>pre</sub>(n)</i>) would be related to the long-term speeding effect (<i>speed<sub>pre</sub>(n + 1)</i> - <i>speed<sub>pre</sub>(n)</i>). Here <i>speed<sub>pre</sub></i> is the speed just before stimulation onset and therefore represents the baseline, and <i>speed<sub>post</sub></i> is the speed during photostimulation, and n and n+1 refer to consecutive sessions. We also note that a direct correlation analysis between the two quantities could be compromised due to the fact that <i>speed<sub>pre</sub>(n)</i> appears in both terms.

(e.g., subsection \u201cEffect of DRN 5-HT photostimulation does not induce anxiety-like behavior\u201d, second paragraph for speed as a function of spatial area; subsection \u201cSpatially-specific DRN 5-HT optogenetic activation does not yield place preference or avoidance\u201d, third paragraph for speed and ROI, see also subsection \u201cLong-term effects of DRN 5-HT photostimulation\u201d, third paragraph). I am not questioning the conclusions of the authors (that the effects are similar across conditions), but to support that claim, they should test directly for a difference between the size of the effects between the 2 conditions. This could be done (for instance) by looking at the interaction between the 2 factors, with an ANOVA, as they did in the third paragraph of the subsection \u201cEffect of DRN 5-HT photostimulation does not induce anxiety-like behavior\u201d. Or by computing the effect of stimulation on speed and assess the effect of session on that measure using a simple linear regression."

As for the long-term open field assay (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), this experiment would require a longer time scale (6-7 weeks only for the experimental execution), therefore, we hope the editor and reviewers understand that we were not able to obtain more data. However, as suggested by reviewer #2, we performed more analysis to look at the correlation between transient and chronic effects."

I am not questioning the conclusions of the authors (that the effects are similar across conditions), but to support that claim, they should test directly for a difference between the size of the effects between the 2 conditions. This could be done (for instance) by looking at the interaction between the 2 factors, with an ANOVA, as they did in the third paragraph of the subsection \u201cEffect of DRN 5-HT photostimulation does not induce anxiety-like behavior\u201d.
