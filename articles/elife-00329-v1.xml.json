Novel bacteria, on the other hand, failed to either activate ADF or to trigger feeding. Moreover, when Song et al. offered the worms familiar bacteria in medium that had previously contained novel bacteria, the residual traces of the novel bacteria stopped the worms from responding to familiar food."

In response to previously encountered stimuli, this ability allows knowledge gained from prior experience to guide animals to respond with an altered output that is beneficial for their survival. Recognition is classified into two types: recollection and familiarity discrimination. Recollection is knowledge of prior occurrence with vivid contextual details. In contrast, familiarity discrimination is mere sensation of prior occurrence and thus does not accompany episodic memory (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brown and Aggleton, 2001</a>). Accumulated studies show that mere exposure to particular food alters subsequent consumption of the food in many different species (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pliner et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wang and Provenza, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Diaz-Cenzano and Chotro, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Morin-Audebrand et al., 2012</a>), suggesting that feeding regulation by familiarity discrimination is conserved across species. Some species including humans consume familiar food more actively than novel food (<a href=\"#bib11\">Diaz-Cenzano and Chotro, 2010</a>), probably to avoid possible pathogens. In contrast, other species consume familiar food less actively than novel food (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wang and Provenza, 1996</a>), probably to assure balanced nutrition intake. Despite extensive studies of recognition (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brown and Aggleton, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barker et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Seoane et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Uslaner et al., in press</a>) and subsequent behavioral plasticity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kandel and Schwartz, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kravitz, 1988</a>), the mechanisms by which familiarity discrimination alters food intake are still poorly understood."

Although it is unknown if familiarity discrimination alters food intake in <i>C. elegans</i>, the following observations support the possibility: The nervous system in <i>C. elegans</i> senses various aspects of food, such as the efficiency with which it supports growth (<a href=\"#bib33\">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</a>) and its pathogenicity (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zhang et al., 2005</a>), and triggers behavioral plasticity. The nervous system can also form memories of various olfactory or gustatory cues (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bargmann, 2006</a>), which is likely to be crucial for the recognition of familiar food. Here, we show that <i>C. elegans</i> discriminates familiar food from novel food and selectively increases feeding in response to familiar food. Using the behavioral pattern that we identified, we uncover the mechanism by which familiarity discrimination increases the feeding response."

Once the animals reached adulthood, we compared feeding rates on previously experienced bacteria (HH and DD groups) to feeding rates on novel bacteria (DH and HD groups) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; see \u2018Feeding assay\u2019 and \u2018Statistical analysis and data presentation\u2019 in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). We found that the feeding rates of the animals on familiar bacteria were significantly higher than the rates on novel bacteria, regardless of bacterial type (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). The increased feeding rates on familiar food compared to the rates on novel food persisted 7\u20138 hr after the training was over, supporting that worms discriminate familiar food from novel food and that recognition of familiar bacteria increases feeding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Consistent with this, the familiar food-induced increase in feeding was not affected by the worm's nutritional status (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013E</a>). We then tested if the behavior is selective for the two tested bacteria by repeating the experiment using other benign bacterial strains, <i>Enterobacteria</i> JU54 and <i>Pseudomonas</i> PA14 <i>pstP</i> (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tan et al., 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Consistent with the idea that mere exposure to any benign bacterium increases subsequent consumption of that bacterium, the feeding rates on familiar bacteria were higher than the rates on novel bacteria, regardless of bacteria type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013E</a>). Finally, we considered the possibility that cultivation on two different bacteria caused the differences in feeding rates on familiar food and novel food by affecting development. If the feeding differences are caused by developmental differences, not familiarity discrimination, an exposure to particular bacteria during adulthood is not expected to cause an increased feeding response to the bacteria. However, 9 hr of exposure to a particular bacterium during adulthood was sufficient to induce a preferential response to that bacterium (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). In contrast to 9 hr, 6-hr exposure to the training food failed to increase subsequent consumption (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>), suggesting that the behavioral plasticity was determined by the duration of exposure to the training food. These data imply that <i>C. elegans</i> forms a recognition memory of particular bacteria after experience, which allows the worms to discriminate familiar bacteria from novel bacteria, and that the recognition of familiar bacteria increases the feeding response."

                                "text": "The neurotransmitter serotonin increases feeding in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Croll, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Avery and Horvitz, 1990</a>) and serotonin has long been suggested to be a food signal in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Horvitz et al., 1982</a>). However, the serotonin effect on feeding was tested only on familiar bacteria; thus it is unknown if the serotonin feeding signaling is activated by novel bacteria. We thus hypothesized that recognition of familiar bacteria might increase the feeding response by activating serotonin signaling. To test our hypothesis, we first tested if a <i>tph-1</i> null mutation suppresses the difference in the feeding rates between animals on familiar bacteria and novel bacteria. <i>tph-1</i> encodes a tryptophan hydroxylase required for serotonin biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sze et al., 2000</a>). We found no difference in the feeding rates between the <i>tph-1</i> null mutant animals on familiar bacteria and novel bacteria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A,B and 5</a>). Furthermore, exogenous serotonin treatment increased the feeding rates on novel food to rates comparable to those on familiar food without affecting the rates on familiar food (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). These data suggest that recognition of familiar bacteria indeed increased feeding rate by activating serotonin signaling. To find out which serotonin receptors mediate the serotonin action on feeding, we compared the feeding rates between wild-type and serotonin receptor null mutants in presence of serotonin. The <i>C. elegans</i> genome encodes four serotonin-activated G protein coupled receptors, SER-1, SER-4, SER-5 and SER-7, and a serotonin-gated Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> channel MOD-1. Among the tested mutants, only the <i>ser-7</i> null mutant failed to activate feeding in presence of serotonin, confirming the previous report that serotonin activates feeding via a type 7 serotonin receptor SER-7 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hobson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Song and Avery, 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Consistent with the idea that serotonin increases feeding via SER-7 in response to familiar food, the feeding rates of <i>ser-7</i> null mutants on familiar food were substantially decreased compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Furthermore, no differences were found in the feeding rates among the <i>tph-1</i> single null mutant, the <i>ser-7</i> single null mutant and the <i>tph-1; ser-7</i> double null mutant on familiar bacteria (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Since SER-7 is the major receptor to mediate the serotonin action, we initially expected no difference between feeding rates of the <i>ser-7</i> null mutant on familiar food and novel food, as for the <i>tph-1</i> null mutant. When the <i>ser-7</i> null mutant animals were tested on DA1878, the feeding rates of the animals did not differ on familiar and novel food (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4F and 7B,D</a>). However, when the animals were tested on HB101, the feeding rate of the animals was lower on familiar test food than on novel test food (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4E and 7A,C</a>). To resolve the unexpected observation, we examined feeding rates in wild type and the <i>ser-7</i> null mutant animals in the presence or absence of serotonin. Serotonin suppressed feeding in the <i>ser-7</i> null mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>), suggesting that serotonin suppresses as well as activates feeding. We also found that null mutations in <i>ser-4</i> and <i>mod-1</i> completely relieved the suppression of feeding by serotonin in the <i>ser-7</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>), suggesting that serotonin suppressed feeding by acting on SER-4 and MOD-1. In support of the idea that the inhibitory serotonin signal via SER-4 and MOD-1 is active only on familiar food, the feeding rates of the <i>ser-4; mod-1; ser-7</i> triple null mutant were greater than the rates of the <i>ser-7</i> single null mutant on familiar food (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4E,F and 7C,D</a>) whereas the feeding rates of the two mutant animals were not different on novel food. Interestingly, the amount of suppression by the inhibitory serotonin signal on familiar food, that is the difference between feeding rates of the <i>ser-4; mod-1; ser-7</i> mutant and the <i>ser-7</i> null mutant animals on familiar food, was greater on HB101 than DA1878 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4E,F and 7F</a>). Although it is not clear why the activities of the inhibitory serotonin signal on the two bacteria are different, it explains the unexpected observation seen in the feeding rate differences between the <i>ser-7</i> null mutant animals on familiar food and novel food in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and F</a>. We next tested whether the inhibitory serotonin signal is essential for recognition of familiar food or its regulation of feeding by comparing the feeding rates of the <i>ser-4; mod-1</i> double null mutant animals on familiar food and novel food. Consistent with the idea that SER-7 is the major serotonin receptor, the double mutant, like wild type, showed increased feeding responses on familiar food compared to novel food (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

Wild-type worms feed more actively on familiar food than novel food. On novel food the feeding rate of wild-type is slightly higher than that of the <i>ser-7</i> null mutant.

(<b>E</b>) A simple linear model explaining how different serotonin receptors might contribute to the regulation of pumping on familiar food and on novel food. There are three effects: B: Basal activity of SER-7, S: Serotonin-stimulated activity of SER-7, and \u2212I: Serotonin-stimulated activity of inhibitory serotonin receptors SER-4 and MOD-1. The net effect of serotonin on wild-type(+) pumping is S + B \u2212 I; the net effect on pumping in a mutant lacking SER-7 is \u2212I. While it is presented as an aid to thinking about the results, none of the results presented in the paper depend on this model. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>, in particular, is a direct measurement of the effect of SER-7 under differing conditions, calculated as the difference in feeding rates between wild-type(+) and the <i>ser-7</i> null mutant worms.

Serotonin is detected in five types of neurons in <i>C. elegans</i> hermaphrodites: NSM, ADF, HSN, RIH and AIM (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sze et al., 2000</a>). RIH and AIM obtain serotonin by taking up extracellular serotonin (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jafari et al., 2011</a>)<i>.</i> HSN is also unlikely to be necessary for the behavioral plasticity because feeding rates of males, which do not have HSN, were also greater on familiar food than the rates on novel food (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). We therefore hypothesized that either NSM or ADF uses serotonin to control feeding. The NSM neurons are a pair of secretory neurons located in the pharynx, whereas the ADF neurons are a pair of chemosensory neurons located outside the pharynx (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sze et al., 2000</a>) that have been suggested to sense bacteria (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991</a>). We asked if serotonin either in ADF or in NSM regulates the feeding response by expressing <i>tph-1</i> cDNA in the <i>tph-1</i> null mutant using either the <i>srh-142</i> promoter or the <i>ceh-2</i> promoter. The <i>srh-142</i> promoter drives expression specifically in ADF and the <i>ceh-2</i> promoter drives expression in NSM and three additional neurons (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liang et al., 2006</a>). We found that restoring serotonin synthesis in ADF, but not in NSM, rescued the feeding response in the <i>tph-1</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>), suggesting that ADF regulates feeding in response to familiar bacteria. Laser killing of ADF, but not NSM, also decreased feeding on familiar food (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>)\u2014the difference in feeding rates between ADF-minus and mock-operated animals (49.8 \u00b1 7.4; feeding rates of ADF-minus and mock-operated animals were 199 \u00b1 7.7 and 249 \u00b1 3.5, respectively) was comparable to the difference in the feeding rates between <i>tph-1</i> and wild-type animals (58.4 \u00b1 3.5; feeding rates of <i>tph-1</i> and wild-type animals were 207.7 \u00b1 1.9 and 266.1 \u00b1 3.0, respectively), further supporting the idea that ADF regulates feeding in response to familiar bacteria."

A <i>ser-7</i> null mutation suppressed the rescue effect of restoring serotonin in ADF in the <i>tph-1</i> null mutant (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). To understand how serotonin increases feeding at a neural circuit level, we asked where SER-7 acts. SER-7 is expressed mostly in pharyngeal neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hobson et al., 2006</a>), which regulate the motions of pharyngeal muscles (<a href=\"#bib2\">Avery and Horvitz, 1989</a>). Among the pharyngeal neurons, MC is particularly interesting because it is essential for normal fast feeding on bacteria (<a href=\"#bib2\">Avery and Horvitz, 1989</a>), and SER-7 was suggested to activate MC (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hobson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Song and Avery, 2012</a>). To ask if SER-7 acts in MC, we expressed SER-7 in the <i>ser-7</i> null mutant using the <i>flp-21</i> and the <i>flp-2</i> promoters. The <i>flp-21</i> and the <i>flp-2</i> promoters drive expression in several neurons, and the expression patterns of the two promoters overlap only in MC and M4 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim and Li, 2004</a>). We found that both <i>pflp-21::</i>SER-7 and <i>pflp-2::</i>SER-7 fully rescued the feeding rate in the <i>ser-7</i> mutant in response to familiar food as well as serotonin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>; Part of the data in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a> were reported previously in <a href=\"#bib34\">Song and Avery, 2012</a> and were re-analyzed and presented here.). In contrast, expression of SER-7 in M4 and occasionally in M2 using the <i>ser-7b</i> promoter failed to alter the pumping rate and had only a small effect on pumping in the <i>ser-7</i> null mutant in response to serotonin and familiar food, respectively (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>), suggesting that SER-7 in MC activates pharyngeal pumping. The failure of rescue is unlikely to be due to insufficient expression because expression of the rescue construct significantly activated isthmus peristalsis, the other feeding motion in <i>C. elegans</i>, which is controlled by M4 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Song and Avery, 2012</a>). To test whether SER-7 indeed acts through MC, we used an <i>eat-2</i> null mutation to test if blocking neurotransmission from MC suppresses the rescue effect of <i>pflp-21</i>::SER-7 in the <i>ser-7</i> mutant. <i>eat-2</i> encodes a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit specifically localized in the pharyngeal muscles postsynaptic to MC (<a href=\"#bib24\">McKay et al., 2004</a>). Thus, an <i>eat-2</i> null mutation selectively blocks cholinergic transmission from MC to the pharyngeal muscles. We found that the <i>eat-2</i> null mutation suppressed the rescue effect of <i>pflp-21</i>::<i>ser-7(</i>+<i>)</i> in response to serotonin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>), supporting our hypothesis that SER-7 in MC increases the feeding response. In summary, we conclude that serotonin released from extrapharyngeal ADF increased feeding in response to familiar bacteria mainly by activating SER-7 in MC directly, which in turn activates cholinergic transmission from MC to the pharyngeal muscles."

A simple explanation is that only familiar bacteria can activate ADF, and this activation causes increased serotonin release. We tested the hypothesis first by asking if ADF is more active on familiar bacteria than novel bacteria by directly measuring the response of the ADF neurons to novel and familiar bacteria using ratiometric calcium imaging. For this, we imaged the ADF neurons using the genetically-encoded calcium sensor Cameleon YC3.60. Changes in intracellular calcium concentration were reported as changes in the ratio of fluorescence emission at distinct wavelengths (\u0394R/R) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Nagai et al., 2004</a>). Slow yet substantial increases in the activity of ADF neurons, reported as an increase in \u0394R/R, were observed in response to familiar food (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A,B</a>). In contrast, only marginal changes in the activity were observed in response to novel food (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A,B</a>). To further quantify the response observed in ADF, we measured the averaged signed area under \u0394R/R for each experimental group (see \u2018Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging\u2019 in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). Consistent with our hypothesis, the increases in ADF activity were greater in response to familiar food than novel food (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12C</a>).

There are several other possible explanations for the greater increase on familiar food than novel food that we cannot exclude, such as increased efficiency of serotonin uptake in serotonin-uptaking cells or increased serotonin release from NSM on familiar food compared to novel food. However, considering that an increase in the efficiency of serotonin uptake is likely to result in a decrease in the level of extracellular serotonin that can activate SER-7 in MC and that restoring serotonin in NSM in the <i>tph-1</i> null mutant or killing NSM in wild type did not affect the feeding response on familiar food, it is more likely that the greater increase is due to increased serotonin release from ADF.

For this, we examined feeding rates of worms on bacteria mixed with LB broth or with medium conditioned by one of the bacteria (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14A</a>). The conditioned media do not contain any bacterial particles, thus, if the media alter the feeding responses to familiar food or novel food, it suggests that gustatory or olfactory cues in the media were sensed by worms and affected discrimination of familiar food from novel food. We found that the media from bacteria that are familiar to the tested worms did not alter the feeding responses to the novel bacteria (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14B,C</a>).

Here, using the simple animal model <i>C. elegans</i>, we delineate a neural pathway by which food exposure alters later consumption of the food. We first showed that regulation of feeding by familiarity discrimination is conserved in <i>C. elegans</i> by showing that (1) Prior exposure to particular bacteria selectively increases feeding in response to those bacteria; (2) The behavior depends on the duration of exposure, but not on the timing of exposure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) or nutritional status (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013E</a>); (3) <i>C. elegans</i> retains the memory of familiar bacteria for at least 7 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E and 2B\u2013E</a>). We speculate that the <i>C. elegans</i> nervous system may have evolved this way to increase the probability of consuming wholesome food by using past food experiences as in higher vertebrates and humans. It was previously shown that na\u00efve worms are attracted to the smell of pathogenic bacteria but develop aversion to it after experience (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zhang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ha et al., 2010</a>). The pathogenic bacteria kill worms in 4 hr (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zhang et al., 2005</a>) and thus, it would be detrimental for worms to increase consumption of the bacteria. Our hypothesis can be tested by testing whether worms increase the feeding response to the pathogenic bacteria after experience."

One plausible explanation is that NSM releases little or no serotonin, which is insufficient to activate MC neurons in the pharynx in response to familiar food. This explanation does not contradict previously reported NSM function in the enhanced slowing response (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sawin et al., 2000</a>) because serotonin from NSM has only a small effect on the behavior (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sawin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Zhang et al., 2005</a>). An endocrine serotonin signal from ADF, not a local serotonin signal from NSM, may have been employed for the feeding activation on familiar food to systemically control multiple behaviors and physiological adaptations. To test this possibility, it would be informative to study whether familiarity of food affects behaviors (<a href=\"#bib18\">Horvitz et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Avery and Horvitz, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Sawin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sze et al., 2000</a>) and various aspects of physiology (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Petrascheck et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Srinivasan et al., 2008</a>) that are controlled by serotonin in presence of food (e.g., the systemic suppression of stress response that requires serotonin from ADF; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ranganathan et al., 2001</a>).

For the aversive learning, it is not yet clear when the serotonin signal from ADF acts. It will be interesting to understand how serotonin signaling from ADF and the physiological context are integrated to produce seemingly opposite experience-dependent behaviors. Further studies to understand regulation of the two seemingly opposite behaviors at the neural circuit level will also help us understand how the <i>C. elegans</i> nervous system differentially encodes, maintains and retrieves the appetitive and aversive memories of bacteria."

Feeding rates of individual worms were quantified by counting pharyngeal contractions 2\u20135 min after the transfer to test food at room temperature (about 23\u00b0C). Feeding motions of individual animals were observed with a Zeiss Stemi SV11 Apo microscope. The feeding rate of each animal (pumps per min) was calculated by averaging the three measures from each animal (pumps per 30 s) and subsequently by multiplying by 2. For each experiment, preparation of worms and reagents and feeding assays were performed in the same way in a designated place, mostly using the same batch of reagents. In contrast, conditions for feeding assays for different experiments varied in several ways, for instance, temperature and amount of test bacteria.

Test food was then prepared by seeding 10 \u03bcl of bacterial culture in LB (OD = 5.0) on each plate as for other feeding assays."

After 30\u201350 s, the solution was switched to LB broth containing either DA1878 or HB101 bacteria (OD = 10.0). ADF neurons were visualized through a Zeiss plan-apochromat 63X, 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Excitation light (436/10 nm) was provided by an X-cite 120 illuminator (Lumen Dynamics Group Inc, Ontario, Canada). For ratiometric imaging, images in cyan (480/15 nm) and yellow (535/20 nm) wavelength bands were simultaneously acquired by the calcium imaging camera (Hamamatsu; ORCA-AG, Bridgewater, NJ) by means of a beam splitter (Optical Insights; OI-DV-FC, Tucson, AZ). The camera was controlled by Micromanager (<a href=\"#bib12\">Edelstein et al., 2010</a>). Frames were acquired at 2\u201310 Hz with a 8 \u00d7 8 binning. The resulting images were analyzed off-line using custom analysis routines written in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Briefly, fluorescence intensity I in the 480 and 535 nm wavelength images was measured in a circular region of interest (ROI) centered on the neuron. Background fluorescence I' was measured in a second ROI surrounding the first one. The raw emission ratio was computed as R = (I<sub>535</sub> \u2212 I'<sub>535</sub>)/(I<sub>480</sub> \u2212 I'<sub>480</sub>) \u2212 0.65, where the latter term corrects for 480-nm channel bleed-through into the 535-nm channel. This raw emission ratio was corrected for photobleaching and normalized by fitting a single exponential function to the emission ratio trace and dividing the latter by the fitted function; thus all ratio changes were expressed in terms of changes in fluorescence, \u0394R/R."

Just after the 7-hr starvation we divided each group into three equal subgroups and fixed one. The remaining two groups were separately refed on either DA1878 or HB101 and fixed after 1 hr. This assay could not be done immediately after training because most of the serotonin-uptaking cells were serotonin positive in DA2300 as in wild type worms. The background was too high to detect any increase in serotonin release. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a protocol from Curtis Loer (<a href=\"http://home.sandiego.edu/~cloer/loerlab/anti5htlong.html\">http://home.sandiego.edu/\u223ccloer/loerlab/anti5htlong.html</a>) with the following antibodies: anti-serotonin rabbit IGG: S5545 (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc), Anti-GFP chicken IGG: GFP-1020 (Aves Labs, Inc), ALEXA FLOUR 488 goat anti-chicken IGG: A11039 (Invitrogen Corporation), Cy-3 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IGG: 711-165-152 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Failure of the co-immunostaining against serotonin and against GFP was 0%. The GFP signal was used to identify serotonergic neurons (<i>ptph-1::gfp</i>) and to find transgenics that express <i>tph-1</i> cDNA in ADF (<i>psrh-142::tph-1::gfp</i>). Due to <i>Is[ptph-1::gfp]</i> in DA2299 and DA2300, GFP signal was found in NSM, ADF, HSN and sporadically in RIH and AIM in all animals. Although <i>ptph-1::gfp</i> expresses GFP in ADF, we could still recognize the transgenic animals that express <i>Ex[psrh-142::tph-1::gfp]</i> because GFP signal in ADF is much stronger in those transgenics. The strong GFP signal in ADF was perfectly correlated with serotonin signal. In DA2300, serotonin signal was found in four different classes of serotonergic neurons (ADF, NSM, RIH and AIM). In DA2299, the control strain that is defective in serotonin uptake, serotonin signal was found only in ADF.

The feeding assay was performed with L1 larvae because it was easier to examine feeding responses of developmentally synchronized worms that are free from bacteria in large numbers. The strategy is particularly useful for the developmentally retarded mutants that carry <i>eat-2(ad465)</i>, which makes comparisons of the feeding rates in adults rather difficult. We confirmed that the effects of single null mutations of the serotonin receptors in response to serotonin are consistent in L1 and adults (data not shown) and thus, it is likely that our observations made in L1 larvae are still valid in adults. After collecting embryos by egg preparation, we incubated them on unseeded NGM plates for 2 hr. Newly hatched L1 larvae (0- to 2-hr-old) were then transferred to unseeded NGM plates and incubated for 3 hr. 15 min after mounting the larvae (3- to 5-hr-old) on 2% agarose pads containing 20 mM serotonin (H7752, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc) in M9, the feeding motions of each larva were observed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a 63\u00d7 objective. 2-min videos were taken from each larva with a Hitachi kP-160 CCD camera and digitized using Adobe Premiere v6.5 for quantification of feeding rates.

At the same time, the range of the day-to-day variation (about 100 pumps/min) is larger than the size of the effect (about 20). Your response mentions that you always tested worms in two conditions at the same time, and on the same day with the same reagents. Then you state that you combined data from 3\u20135 experiments (meaning 3\u20135 days presumably) together. This latter methodology makes the variability more difficult to understand. Why wouldn't the day-to-day variation average out similarly across groups? Moreover, if similar numbers of experiment- and control-animals were not assayed in each experiment, then how can data from the different days be grouped together (unless there was no day-by-day variation)? It is therefore necessary to provide more methodological details. Finally, related to this issue are negative conclusions from experiments that have control pumping rates on the very low side (e.g., Figures 4b, 5a). As it is not clear that the pumping rate could be lower than such low control values, it is not clear that the conclusions stated are warranted."

At the same time, the range of the day-to-day variation (about 100 pumps/min) is larger than the size of the effect (about 20). Your response mentions that you always tested worms in two conditions at the same time, and on the same day with the same reagents. Then you state that you combined data from 3\u20135 experiments (meaning 3\u20135 days presumably) together. This latter methodology makes the variability more difficult to understand. Why wouldn't the day-to-day variation average out similarly across groups? Moreover, if similar numbers of experiment- and control-animals were not assayed in each experiment, then how can data from the different days be grouped together (unless there was no day-by-day variation)? It is therefore necessary to provide more methodological details</i>."
