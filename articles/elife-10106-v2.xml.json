How might cooperation persist against cheaters? Two classes of mechanisms are known to promote cooperation: 'partner choice', where a cooperator preferentially interacts with cooperative over cheating partners; and 'partner fidelity feedback', where repeated interactions between individuals ensure that cheaters suffer as their cooperative partners languish (see, for example, <a href=\"#bib66\">Momeni et al., 2013</a>). However when both mechanisms can act, differentiating them has generated controversy. Here, I resolve this controversy by noting that selection can operate on organismal and sub-organismal 'entities' such that partner fidelity feedback at sub-organismal level can appear as partner choice at organismal level. I also show that cooperation between multicellular eukaryotes and mitochondria is promoted by partner fidelity feedback and partner choice between sub-organismal entities, in addition to being promoted by partner fidelity feedback between hosts and symbionts, as was previously known."

Cooperation is thought to drive major evolutionary transitions such as the emergence of eukaryotes and multicellularity (<a href=\"#bib61\">Maynard Smith and Szathmary, 1998</a>). Cooperation between pathogenic microbes can worsen microbial infection (<a href=\"#bib82\">Sandoz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Falsetta et al., 2014</a>). Cooperation between cells in tumor microenvironment can hasten cancer progression (<a href=\"#bib78\">Rattigan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cleary et al., 2014</a>). In industrial fermentation, we strive to keep microbes in a cooperative state (producing products useful to us despite the metabolic burden to microbes), and exploit inter-species\u00a0cooperation to increase product yield (<a href=\"#bib100\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>). Thus, understanding cooperation has broad implications in basic and applied biology."

A focal cooperator pays a net fitness cost\u00a0(Appendix\u00a0note 2) to generate benefits that can be shared or exchanged\u00a0(Appendix\u00a0note 3) with partners. Partners may belong to the same species as the focal cooperator (e.g. kin cooperation, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) or a different species (mutualistic cooperation, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Partners may cooperate by reciprocating to the focal cooperator a similar benefit (homotypic cooperation, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) or a different costly benefit (heterotypic cooperation,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)\u00a0(Appendix\u00a0note 4), or cheat by not reciprocating (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, unfilled\u00a0blue). When cooperative and cheating partners share equal access to the focal cooperator, under certain circumstances cheating partners will always be\u00a0more fit than cooperative partners\u00a0(Appendix\u00a0note 5). In this case, cooperation may persist only if the community is partitioned into interaction groups (groups)\u00a0(Appendix\u00a0note 6) that are sufficiently variable in cooperator frequency (<a href=\"#bib75\">Price, 1970</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib88\">Trivers, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bull and Rice, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Frank, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">1997</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib27\">Foster and Wenseleers, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fletcher and Doebeli, 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This way, since\u00a0cooperator-dominated groups will produce more cooperative benefits than cheater-dominated groups, individuals in cooperator-dominated groups (likely cooperators) will\u00a0reproduce more than individuals in cheater-dominated groups (likely cheaters). Consequently,\u00a0cooperator frequency can increase in a community despite decreasing in each group (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

During iron limitation, a focal cooperative <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> cell (grey filled\u00a0oval) pays a fitness cost to synthesize siderophores (grey triangles, color indicating origin) which are released into the environment to scavenge iron. Siderophore-Fe<sup>3+</sup> complex can be taken up by the focal bacterium and partner cells. A cooperative partner (blue filled oval) also contributes siderophores which can be used by the focal cooperator. In contrast, a cheating partner (blue unfilled\u00a0oval) uses siderophores without contributing any, and is competitively superior to cooperators (<a href=\"#bib33\">Griffin et al., 2004</a>). (<b>B</b>) An example of heterotypic (exchanging different benefits) and mutualistic (between different species) cooperation, and cheating. In the obligatory cooperation between a yucca (grey) and yucca moths, moths can cooperate (left) or cheat (right). (<b>C</b>) In PC, a focal individual (grey) displays different responses ('conditional response', i and ii) or a fixed response ('screening', iii) that favors cooperative over cheating partners. (i and ii) A focal client (grey, bottom) will preferentially visit a cleaner (smaller blue fish) if the cleaner previously cooperated with (filled blue) instead of cheated (unfilled blue)\u00a0another client (yellow, top) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bshary and Grutter, 2006</a>) or the focal client itself (grey, top) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bshary and Sch\u00e4ffer, 2002</a>). Cooperative cleaners only eat parasites (black squares), while cheating cleaners bite off nutritious client tissue. Thus, PC can operate before (i) or after (ii) interactions with partners. (iii) A focal cooperative yeast cell (grey) pays a fitness cost to express cell surface adhesive proteins. The focal adhesive cell will bind better to other adhesive cooperators (filled blue) than to non-adhesive cheaters (unfilled blue). This differential binding (solid versus dashed grey box) favors cooperation between adhesive cells, and allows the formation of cell clumps with enhanced stress resistance (<a href=\"#bib85\">Smukalla et al., 2008</a>). (<b>D</b>) Cooperation between hosts (grey)\u00a0and endosymbionts such as mitochondria (blue) has been traditionally used to illustrate PFF (<a href=\"#bib80\">Sachs et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">2011</a>). Cooperative mitochondria (filled blue) serve the host cell at a cost to their own reproduction, and are therefore displaced by cheating mitochondria (unfilled blue) in the same cell (center panel). However, vertical transmission of mitochondria means that host and mitochondria repeatedly interact with each other. This ensures that mitochondria will harm their own fitness if they do not serve their host (compare left with right). Consequently, cooperative mitochondria can persist (compare bottom with top) if their frequency varies greatly among different hosts. For this and all following figures, filled and unfilled symbols differentiate cooperative versus cheating partners."

[L\u2212 A+], [A\u2212 L+], and [L\u2212] are reproductively isolated yeast cells expressing different fluorescent proteins. On an agarose pad lacking adenine and lysine supplements, [A\u2212 L+] (green) and its cooperative [L\u2212 A+] (magenta) and cheating [L\u2212] (blue) partners undergo self-organization from an initially random spatial distribution.

In PFF (ii), such discrimination does not exist. Instead, cooperative benefits are more available toward partner entities closer-by regardless of their cooperativeness. Beneficial interactions are marked by black arrows, with directions of benefit flow marked by arrowheads and interaction strength marked by line thickness. (<b>C</b>) A comparison of PC and PFF. (<b>D</b>) Top: Anti-competition cooperation in bacteria. Cooperators (filled ovals) but not cheaters (unfilled ovals) harbor toxin-antitoxin gene pair. Cooperators grow slower than cheaters. When encountering stress such as high cell density, a fraction of cooperators will 'commit suicide' (yellow) by lysing themselves (dashed outline) and release stable toxin (black). The remaining cooperators (filled blue) are immune to toxin because they express antitoxins (grey), while cheaters (unfilled\u00a0blue)\u00a0are sensitive to toxin-killing (dashed outline). This cell killing reduces competition, a benefit shared among surviving cooperators (filled blue) and cheaters (unfilled\u00a0blue, solid outline). Bottom\u00a0left: When PC acts alone in a well-mixed environment, cooperators can increase in frequency only if their initial abundance is sufficiently high. To see how this works, suppose that whenever total population size has reached 250, 10% of cooperators will commit suicide, and each suicidal cooperator can kill 2 cheaters. If starting at 210 cooperators and 40 cheaters, all cheaters will be killed off. However, if starting at 50 cooperators and 200 cheaters, the cheater population will diminish by 10 individuals (5%) only, compared to the 10% reduction in cooperators. Bottom\u00a0right: In a spatially-structured environment, the joint action of PC and PFF favors cooperators even when cooperators are initially very rare.

However, definitions of these terms are unclear. For example, a biochemist might interpret 'passive' as not requiring ATP (e.g. passive diffusion), while a geneticist might interpret 'passive' as not requiring genes (e.g. death from some environmental assaults does not require gene activities). To further illustrate this problem, let\u2019s examine PFF acting alone in the absence of PC in a community of engineered yeast strains\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib66\">Momeni et al., 2013</a>). In this community, adenine-requiring cooperators release lysine ([A\u2212 L+]) while lysine-requiring partners cooperate by reciprocating adenine ([L\u2212 A+]) or cheat by not reciprocating adenine ([L\u2212]) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Supplying metabolites is costly (e.g. [L\u2212] is more fit than [L\u2212 A+]) (<a href=\"#bib93\">Waite and Shou, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Momeni et al., 2013</a>). PC does not operate here: lysine released from a focal [A\u2212 L+] cell is available to both [L\u2212] and [L\u2212 A+]. In a spatially-structured environment (e.g. on an agarose pad) without adenine or lysine supplements, [A\u2212 L+] and [L\u2212 A+] physically mix and grow to form tall 'hills' while cheating [L\u2212] segregate to 'foothills' and fail to grow tall (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Consistent with this being PFF, disruption of repeated interactions via frequent mixing favors cheater [L\u2212] over cooperator [L\u2212\u00a0A+]. Furthermore, population bottleneck during spatial range expansion (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hallatschek et al., 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib65\">Mitri et al., 2015</a>), which presumably increases variability in cooperator frequency across different locations, favors cooperator (L\u2212 A+] over cheater (L\u2212] (<a href=\"#bib66\">Momeni et al., 2013</a>). However one could argue, albeit somewhat absurdly, that this PFF relies on the fact that cells can 'recognize' metabolites from partners via permeases and mount 'conditional responses' (growth versus no growth to cooperative versus cheating partners). And this process is not 'passive' either, because cell growth requires energy and numerous genes."

However, this alternative criterion can also encounter difficulties. Suppose that PC initially did not exist. It would seem reasonable that an evolved response to cheater-specific signals should be channeled to preexisting stress-response pathways which are already in place to facilitate survival. That is, flower abortion in response to physical damages does not preclude the possibility that the same flower abortion\u00a0pathway can also be activated by cheater-specific signals. Thus, a clear criterion to differentiate PFF and PC is, to date, lacking (Appendix note 10)."

An organism such as a yucca is an entity, because different parts of the yucca are coupled not only physically but also chemically (e.g. metabolism), and because equivalent intra-yucca coupling does not exist between yuccas. Consequently, the birth, or growth, or survival, or death of a yucca can be separated from other similar entities (Appendix note 12). Ascending above organism, an entity can be a collection of organisms. For example, a yucca and its internal moth offspring together can be considered an entity (Appendix note 13). This is because moth offspring depend on host yucca for survival, and this dependency does not extend to another yucca.\u00a0The collection of moth offspring inside a yucca is also an entity, because the survival of these moth offspring are coupled through the survival of their shared host yucca, and such coupling does not exist with moth offspring in another yucca. Similarly, an ant colony where the task of maintaining the colony is divided among different castes is also an entity. In contrast, a collection of trees in a forest of similar trees does not constitute an entity, because coupling within a collection (e.g. competition between trees within the collection) extends to between collections. Descending below organism, an entity can also be an organismal part. For example, a yucca flower is an entity because it can be aborted independently of other flowers. Similarly, a yucca flower and its internal moth offspring together can be considered an entity, and the collection of moth offspring inside a yucca flower can also be considered an entity.\u00a0Cells or gametes are entities in a multicellular organism, because they can divide and/or die independently of other similar entities. Similarly, mitochondria are entities in a cell, and mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) are independently replicating entities in a mitochondrion (see section below). Thus, an entity (e.g. a yucca<b>-</b>and its internal\u00a0moth larvae) can contain smaller entities (e.g. the moth larvae; the yucca) which contain even smaller entities (e.g. flowers) which contain even smaller entities (e.g. cells, mitochondria, mtDNAs), reflecting the hierarchical organization of multicellular organisms (Appendix note 14)."

As an example of PFF, let\u2019s consider 'proportional tit for tat (pTFT)', a game theory strategy. In pTFT, the focal individual starts cooperating and subsequently cooperates with a probability equal to the fraction of cooperative partners from the previous round of interactions (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hilbe et al., 2014</a>). PC does not operate in pTFT, since the focal individual does not differentiate cooperative versus cheating partners in the same interaction group. Indeed, for pTFT to survive cheaters, both requirements of PFF must be satisfied: repeated interactions in groups and large variation in the frequency of pTFT across groups (<a href=\"#bib6\">Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981</a>)."

However, we can also view this as <i>PFF between yucca flowers and pollinator offspring</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, right). Note that since a focal flower can not discriminate its internal, spatially-equivalent pollinator offspring, PC does not operate here. Instead, PFF between flowers and pollinator offspring requires the spatially-structured environment defined by flowers (Appendix note 19). In summary, a single mechanism (aborting cheater-dominated flowers) can be viewed as PC between a focal yucca and its internal pollinator offspring <i>and</i> as PFF between yucca flowers and pollinator offspring.

PC requires that a focal cooperative entity can direct more benefits to cooperative over cheating partner entities despite their spatial equivalence. PFF suppresses cheaters that have escaped PC (if PC exists) via repeated interactions between entities in groups that, by chance, show high variability in cooperator frequency. By applying this revised definition, I show that sometimes, PFF at a lower level (e.g. between yucca flowers and moth offspring) may appear as PC at a higher level (between a yucca and moth offspring). PFF and PC can also act in conjunction at multiple levels to promote cooperation, as exemplified in the mitochondrion-eukaryote cooperation. This framework brings conceptual clarity for understanding the persistence of cooperation."

First, cooperators and cheaters can accumulate different mutations while adapting to their abiotic environment, making it possible for cooperators to sometimes outcompete cheaters (<a href=\"#bib67\">Morgan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Waite and Shou, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Asfahl et al., 2015</a>). Second, self-interest and the ability to cooperate can be genetically linked (<a href=\"#bib26\">Foster et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dandekar et al., 2012</a>). For example in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum, dimA</i> couples the ability to cooperate (forming non-reproductive stalk) with self-interest (forming reproductive spores). Finally, the fitness difference between cheaters and cooperators can depend on the environment. For example, cooperative but not cheating yeast cells pay a cost to express cell-surface invertase which converts extracellular sucrose to usable monosaccharides. Rare cooperators are more fit than abundant cheaters. This is because a cooperator can privatize a very small amount of monosaccharides generated by its cell-surface invertase, and this benefit already exceeds the cost of cooperation when monosaccharides are scarce (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gore et al., 2009</a>). On the other hand, rare cheaters are more fit than abundant cooperators. This is because abundant cooperators generate high levels of monosaccharides, and the privatization of monosaccharides by cooperators leads to only a negligible further increase in growth rate which can no longer offset the cost of invertase production (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gore et al., 2009</a>). This frequency-dependent selection leads to the coexistence of cooperators and cheaters."

Mitochondria undergo dynamic fusion and fission which mix organelle contents including mtDNAs (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chan, 2006</a>). Thus inside a cell, a scenario similar to that modeled in the Price equation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) occurs: mtDNAs are divided into spatially-separated mitochondria that interact through fusion (group dissolution) and fission (group formation). mtDNAs can cooperate with their host mitochondrion by, for example, generating the membrane potential required for resource import into mitochondrion, or cheat by not performing these tasks (<a href=\"#bib18\">Clayton, 1992</a>). A model\u00a0based on the Price equation predicts that frequent fusion will homogenize mtDNAs across mitochondria, and thus allow competitively-superior cheating mtDNAs to rise to high frequency even if fusion temporarily allows functional mitochondria to complement dysfunctional mitochondria. Too little fusion or fission is also predicted to disfavor cooperative mtDNAs, because in isolated groups, cheating mtDNAs will eventually arise from cooperative mtDNAs via mutations\u00a0and outcompete cooperative mtDNAs."

In 2013, Diethard Tautz kindly invited me to the EMBO EMBL Symposium 'New Model Systems for Linking Evolution and Ecology'. After my talk, Andrew Moore from BioEssays invited me to write about the evolution of cooperation. I decided to tackle the controversy raised by the very interesting Weyl et al. paper. I initially defined PC as being 'active' in the genetic sense (e.g. flower abortion is PC if a mutation can prevent such abortion). Reviewers were (rightly) not happy with this definition. The verdict was that I should write a review instead, a task that I was not too enthusiastic about given the many existing reviews. To better understand PC versus PFF, I subsequently went through many versions of ideas. During this time, Babak Momeni tirelessly served as my intellectual sounding-board. I thank my colleagues (Maxine Linial, Karen Craig, Chichun Chen, Robin Green, Bj\u00f6rn Kafsack, Ben Kerr, Will Harcombe, and Suzannah Rutherford) and participants of the 2015 Microbial Population Biology Gordon Research Conference (Genya Frenkel, Wolfram M\u00f6bius, and Kevin Foster) for discussions and to Ben Kerr for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. Finally, I thank all reviewers (Jim Bull, Luke McNally, Diethard Tautz, Douglas Yu,\u00a0and anonymous) for constructive criticisms.

A plant allows nitrogen-fixing bacteria to colonize various (discrete) patches in its roots. Each colonized patch functions independently of others. If the bacteria provide sufficient nitrogen to the patch, the plant cells in the patch proliferate and automatically 'feed' the bacteria carbohydrates, and the bacteria then proliferate as well; the mix of bacteria and plant cells in the patch increase accordingly and become a functioning nodule that benefits the plant and the bacteria. However, if the bacteria do not provide nitrogen to the patch, the plant cells in that patch die and thus so do the bacteria that colonized the patch. Thus, at the level of the individual patch, the mechanism is partner fidelity feedback \u2013 cooperators proliferate because of the feedback from helping their partners. But at the level of the entire plant, the mechanism is (I hope) partner choice \u2013 because the plant has disproportionately rewarded cooperative bacteria. The attempt to discriminate mechanisms gets murky unless one acknowledges that different mechanisms are operating, depending on which 'entities' are being considered."

The formal definition appears to emphasize discrimination among spatially equivalent partners as the key. My sense is that the new definition in this paper does indeed 'work,' but it needs to be expanded/modified in a couple ways to be fully operational. First, there is only a definition of partner choice. Partner fidelity feedback should also be defined, even if to say it is everything except choice. Second, the definition is cryptic about its use of 'entity.' I think that the formal definition should be expanded to explain more about 'entities.' The text following the definition does so, but something needs to go in the definition, so that when the definition gets quoted in future work, 'entities' are formally explained. I emphasize this point about entities because I suspect much of the confusion and controversy in the field lies in the failure to appreciate the potential operation of different mechanisms at different levels in the individual (that multiple levels of entities may exist within one individual); thus one of the paper's main contributions may be to raise awareness about entities. Note that my hypothetical example above fits logically into the 'entity' paradigm \u2013 the root patches are one level of entity, the cells within the patches another level."

It is of course challenging to write such a paper, because the topic is not intuitive, so a general audience needs to be given considerable background that is already well known within the field. Keeping the paper short limits the depth of this background before the paper dives into the new material. So such a paper will pose difficulties in the best of circumstances. But I nonetheless think the paper is not written to be widely accessible. Specifically, there is too much explanation embedded in details of biological systems to fully comprehend the (Abstract) points that constitute the substance of the paper. I think the paper would be more easily understood if it relied on hypothetical examples easily grasped by the reader: hypothetical examples can force the focus onto the key issues and avoid distracting details. The hypothetical examples can be borrowed from natural examples, but they should be structured to emphasize only the point being made. The description of natural examples could come late, once the main points are laid out with hypothetical examples."

However, this leads to the question of how useful is this distinction between PFF and PC for understanding the evolution of cooperation? Is this a meaningful debate? My general feeling is that the debate does matter and can help us identify mechanisms and genes underlying cooperation and mutualism. However, I think a general readership would greatly benefit from discussion of why the distinction between PFF and PC matters and isn't simply semantics. I would suggest adding this at the beginning of the paper to engage readers before the author outlines her revised criteria."

In particular, the author mentions the example of the conflicting views over whether the figure tree and figure wasp mutualism is maintained by PC or PFF. If the author could suggest a hypothetical experiment to distinguish between PC and PFF in this example it would greatly strengthen her case that this distinction is practically useful for understanding mechanisms of cooperation."

I see the main strength of the author's scheme as being the separation of causes into two meaningful biological components, that of demography (partner fidelity feedback, which captures population structure, group augmentation, non-linear demographic feedbacks) and plasticity (partner choice, which captures direct, indirect and generalised reciprocity, punishment, policing, greenbeards, kin recognition). Stating this more explicitly would help relate the new scheme to previous schemes and highlight it's main strength \u2013 while more specific effects are difficult to partition (e.g. telling apart different forms of reciprocity), the author offers a simple way to separate the effects of demography and plasticity."

A plant allows nitrogen-fixing bacteria to colonize various (discrete) patches in its roots. Each colonized patch functions independently of others. If the bacteria provide sufficient nitrogen to the patch, the plant cells in the patch proliferate and automatically 'feed' the bacteria carbohydrates, and the bacteria then proliferate as well; the mix of bacteria and plant cells in the patch increase accordingly and become a functioning nodule that benefits the plant and the bacteria. However, if the bacteria do not provide nitrogen to the patch, the plant cells in that patch die and thus so do the bacteria that colonized the patch. Thus, at the level of the individual patch, the mechanism is partner fidelity feedback \u2013 cooperators proliferate because of the feedback from helping their partners. But at the level of the entire plant, the mechanism is (I hope) partner choice \u2013 because the plant has disproportionately rewarded cooperative bacteria. The attempt to discriminate mechanisms gets murky unless one acknowledges that different mechanisms are operating, depending on which 'entities' are being considered.</i> "

The formal definition appears to emphasize discrimination among spatially equivalent partners as the key. My sense is that the new definition in this paper does indeed 'work,' but it needs to be expanded/modified in a couple ways to be fully operational. First, there is only a definition of partner choice. Partner fidelity feedback should also be defined, even if to say it is everything except choice. Second, the definition is cryptic about its use of 'entity.' I think that the formal definition should be expanded to explain more about 'entities.' The text following the definition does so, but something needs to go in the definition, so that when the definition gets quoted in future work, 'entities' are formally explained. I emphasize this point about entities because I suspect much of the confusion and controversy in the field lies in the failure to appreciate the potential operation of different mechanisms at different levels in the individual (that multiple levels of entities may exist within one individual); thus one of the paper's main contributions may be to raise awareness about entities. Note that my hypothetical example above fits logically into the 'entity' paradigm \u2013 the root patches are one level of entity, the cells within the patches another level.</i> "

However, I have one substantial revision that I feel is necessary before publication. Reading the previous version of the manuscript I believed the author was primarily concerned with interspecies/heterotypic cooperation. However, from this revision and the author's responses I can now see that the ambition of this paper is wider, aiming to provide a framework for understanding both interspecies and intraspecies cooperation. I think this is fine, and the author generally makes a strong case. However, my major concern here is that while the relationship between the author's classification scheme and previous schemes for classifying interspecies cooperation is clear, there is insufficient discussion of the relationship between the author's classification scheme and previous classification schemes for the evolution of intraspecies cooperation. I hesitate to suggest new additions on a second round of review, but I think the author could address my points by adding a short subsection to the paper, and think that this is essential to support the lofty ambition of the paper.</i> "
