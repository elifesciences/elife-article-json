For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) needs to transport copies of its RNA out of the nucleus of the host cell and into the cell's cytoplasm in order to create important viral proteins. To do this, a protein in HIV called Rev hijacks a transporter protein that carries cargo across the membrane that surrounds the cell nucleus. As a biochemical entity, Rev has proven to be truly exasperating over the last two miserable decades due to its propensity to generally misbehave\u2014by aggregating or forming fibrils or oligomers\u2014when studied in the laboratory. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, two papers by Alan Frankel and colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco provide a more detailed structural picture for how Rev works (<a href=\"#bib1\">Booth et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Jayaraman et al., 2014</a>)."

The RNA binding region interacts with a part of the viral RNA called the Rev-Responsive Element (RRE). A small (\u223c30 nucleotide) binding site within this element has a high affinity for Rev, and a larger complex forms from this binding site (<a href=\"#bib6\">Heaphy et al., 1990</a>). The RNA binding region of Rev forms an alpha helix that docks in to a complementary groove in the high affinity binding site on the RRE (<a href=\"#bib9\">Kjems et al., 1990</a>). Adding more Rev proteins onto the RRE results in the formation of a series of larger complexes, but where these additional Rev molecules bind is generally not known. The one exception is a weak secondary Rev binding site that has been identified adjacent to the high affinity site. Truncated RREs are generally less efficient for nuclear transport, and so the consensus is that multiple Rev proteins must bind to the RRE for efficient viral RNA transport."

Two previously published crystal structures of Rev dimers have revealed the molecular details of these two interfaces (<a href=\"#bib2\">Daugherty et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Dimattia et al., 2010</a>)."

As Crm1 normally transports human proteins, Rev has effectively hijacked a protein transport pathway to ensure the viral RNA is efficiently transported to the cytoplasm. A number of crystal structures of Crm1 bound to a Nuclear Export Signal peptide have been reported previously (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Guttler et al., 2010</a>), which show that a curved surface of Crm1 mediates this interaction."

Many of the interactions seen in this structure fit well within the framework of structures collected by studying smaller parts of the protein individually. Both the high affinity and secondary Rev binding sites on the RRE are occupied as expected, and the architecture of the Rev\u2013Rev dimer interface is clearly seen. In the second paper, for which David Booth is the first author, the structure of a Rev-RRE-Crm1 complex was solved using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing the existence of a Crm1 dimer interface that is unique among reported Crm1-cargo structures (<a href=\"#bib1\">Booth et al., 2014</a>)."

First, there are significant differences between the Rev\u2013Rev dimer interface in the Rev-RRE complex reported by Jayaraman et al. and previously determined structures. In particular, the angles between the helices that connect the Rev monomers into dimers are completely different. It is also not entirely clear how the dimer interfaces now observed can be reconciled into a coherent picture of the functional Rev-RRE complex. In principle, the new Rev dimer-RRE structure represents the most advanced molecular model of an intermediate stage of assembly of the final complex. However, the RRE sequence had to be significantly altered to obtain usable crystals for imaging, so we cannot be completely certain that the complexes formed are functional. Furthermore, the data are consistent with the possibility that Rev:RRE could take on multiple different arrangements with respect to Crm1, which complicates the structural analysis."

It is also not yet possible to understand from the RRE fragments how the Rev dimers in the crystal structure might be arranged in the context of the full RRE. Therefore, the question of the overall architecture of the export complex remains unanswered."

The new glimpses of molecular details that have been obtained in these papers will serve to generate the next generation of hypotheses. It may turn out that a Rev dimer or tetramer on the RRE is sufficient to recruit the Crm1 dimer that is the functional export complex. It is important to recall that the Rev concentration in HIV infected cells is very low, and may well be below the concentration necessary to form the menagerie of complexes that have been experimentally generated over the past two decades. Frankel, Jayaraman, Booth and co-workers are to be congratulated on their accomplishments in these most recent studies. However, I personally remain frustrated about how all of these divergent complexes can be understood in a coherent molecular picture. Rev remains for the moment a <i>R</i>eally <i>e</i>xasperating <i>v</i>iral protein."
