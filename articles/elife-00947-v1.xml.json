The membrane determinant to initiate the formation of autophagosomes remains elusive. Here, we establish a cell-free assay based on LC3 lipidation to define the organelle membrane supporting early autophagosome formation. In vitro LC3 lipidation requires energy and is subject to regulation by the pathways modulating autophagy in vivo. We developed a systematic membrane isolation scheme to identify the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) as a primary membrane source both necessary and sufficient to trigger LC3 lipidation in vitro. Functional studies demonstrate that the ERGIC is required for autophagosome biogenesis in vivo. Moreover, we find that the ERGIC acts by recruiting the early autophagosome marker ATG14, a critical step for the generation of preautophagosomal membranes."

The membrane determinant to initiate the formation of autophagosomes remains elusive. Here, we establish a cell-free assay based on LC3 lipidation to define the organelle membrane supporting early autophagosome formation. In vitro LC3 lipidation requires energy and is subject to regulation by the pathways modulating autophagy in vivo. We developed a systematic membrane isolation scheme to identify the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) as a primary membrane source both necessary and sufficient to trigger LC3 lipidation in vitro. Functional studies demonstrate that the ERGIC is required for autophagosome biogenesis in vivo. Moreover, we find that the ERGIC acts by recruiting the early autophagosome marker ATG14, a critical step for the generation of preautophagosomal membranes."

For example, when nutrients are abundant, cells can grow or proliferate; in times of scarcity, however, they must conserve resources for essential tasks. In particular, during periods of starvation, cells can cannibalize themselves in a process called autophagy, which literally means \u2018self-eating\u2019. Structures called autophagosomes engulf bits of cytoplasm and carry the contents to the digestive compartment of the cell, the lysosome, to be broken down into their constituent parts. This can include the degradation of proteins into amino acids, which can then be recycled into other proteins needed by the cell."

From the ER, the proteins move to a compartment called the Golgi apparatus, which then sends them to their destinations, or to the lysosome to be broken down.

To identify which of these membranes might be involved, Ge et al. focused on a protein called LC3 that is a key marker for the formation of the autophagosome. This protein is recruited to the growing autophagosome by a lipid, so discovering which membranes can add a lipid to LC3 should shed light on the assembly process."

Together, these results provide insight into the mechanism of autophagosome formation, and the structures in the cell that participate in this process."

                        "text": "In the process of starvation-induced autophagy, several upstream signals are triggered, including inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR), and activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AMP kinase (AMPK) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Noda and Ohsumi, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wei et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rubinsztein et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). These signals are conveyed to activate the serine/threonine-protein kinase complex containing the Atg1 homologs ULK1/2, ATG13, FIP200 (RB1CC1) and ATG101 (C12orf44) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mizushima, 2010</a>). Together with upstream signals, this complex promotes the formation and membrane docking of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3 (PtdIns3)-kinase (PI3K) complex consisting of ATG14 (ATG14L/Barkor), the Atg6 homologue BECN1 (Beclin1), VPS34 (PIK3C3) and VPS15 (p150) for phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) production (<a href=\"#bib51\">Obara and Ohsumi, 2011</a>). Subsequently, DFCP1 (ZFYVE1), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated PI3P binding protein, is recruited to the site of newly-generated PI3P to form omegasomes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Axe et al., 2008</a>). This is followed by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems to produce the ATG12\u2013ATG5 conjugate and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-lipidated ATG8/LC3, which initiates the formation of a preautophagosomal organelle termed the phagophore or isolation membrane (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mizushima et al., 1998a</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">1998b</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ichimura et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Geng and Klionsky, 2008</a>). The membrane then expands and engulfs cytoplasmic components. Finally, the crescent-shaped tubular membrane seals to form a double-membraned autophagosome with cytoplasmic components enclosed within the inner membrane. Fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome leads to the breakdown of the inner membrane together with the trapped cytosolic material (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mizushima et al., 1998a</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Burman and Ktistakis, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Yang and Klionsky, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Weidberg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rubinsztein et al., 2012</a>)."

Recent data suggest a multi-membrane source model for autophagosome biogenesis. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) supports PI3P-dependent formation of the omegasome, a cradle for phagophore generation and elongation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Axe et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yla-Anttila et al., 2009</a>). The outer membrane of the mitochondrion may also supply lipids for the phagophore and autophagosome (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hailey et al., 2010</a>). Recently, a study by Hamasaki et al. (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hamasaki et al., 2013</a>) indicates the ER\u2013mitochondrial junction as being required for autophagosome biogenesis, possibly reconciling these two origins. In addition, clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane have been shown to promote phagophore expansion through the SNARE protein VAMP7 and its partner SNAREs (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ravikumar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Moreau et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, ATG9-positive vesicles cycle between distinct cytoplasmic compartments to deliver membrane to a developing autophagosome or, in yeast, to phagophore assembly sites (PAS) (<a href=\"#bib79\">Young et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sekito et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mari et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nair et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Orsi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Yamamoto et al., 2012</a>). Autophagosomes may also acquire membrane from other sources including Golgi (<a href=\"#bib16\">Geng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ohashi and Munro, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">van der Vaart et al., 2010</a>), early endosomes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Longatti et al., 2012</a>) and vesicles budding from the ER and Golgi (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hamasaki et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Zoppino et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Guo et al., 2012</a>). Although tremendous progress has been made, a direct functional link between a membrane source and autophagosome biogenesis has not been established. Furthermore, the identity of the membrane determinant that responds to a stress signal to initiate autophagosome formation is unknown."

Intriguingly, PE, the substrate for LC3 lipidation, was not enriched in the fractions that triggered T7-LC3 lipidation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The high activity of these membrane fractions was not caused by selective enrichment of the autophagic factors directly contributing to LC3 lipidation, as all of these factors are enriched in the cytosol, or by influencing the formation of the ATG5\u201312\u201316 complex essential for LC3 lipidation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fujita et al., 2008</a>) compared with other membrane fractions (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data indicate that factors other than those directly involved in catalyzing LC3 lipidation contribute to the high lipidation activity of these membranes. We further found that the lipidation reaction triggered by the ERGIC-enriched membranes was enhanced by cytosol from starved cells and was inhibited by wortmannin and FYVE peptide (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

H89 is a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor that blocks COPII-coated vesicle assembly by preventing SAR1 binding to ER membrane when used at a high concentration (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chijiwa et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aridor and Balch, 2000</a>). Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal metabolite that inhibits ARF1 activation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Peyroche et al., 1999</a>). Treatment of cells with a high concentration of H89 (100 \u00b5M) led to the dispersal of ERGIC53 whereas GM130, a cis-Golgi marker, remained in the perinuclear region, suggesting that the ERGIC is disrupted but not the cis-Golgi (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A low concentration of H89 (10 \u00b5M), which is enough to inhibit PKA, did not affect the localization of either ERGIC53 or GM130 (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). BFA treatment collapsed the Golgi into puncta colocalizing with ERGIC53 (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We first developed a cell-free assay based on in vitro LC3 lipidation to measure autophagosome biogenesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1\u20133</a>). By combining this assay with membrane fractionation, we identified an ERGIC-enriched fraction as the most active membrane to trigger LC3 lipidation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4\u20137</a>). Next we used organelle immuno-/inhibitor depletion and immunoisolation to demonstrate that the ERGIC is necessary and sufficient to support LC3 lipidation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8 and 9</a>). Finally, we provided evidence that the ERGIC membrane acts by recruiting ATG14 to initiate PI3K activity, an early step essential for autophagosome biogenesis (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figures 10\u201312</a>)."

Indeed, it is improbable that one organelle contributes all the membrane constituents that become part of a mature autophagosome. Nonetheless, it seems likely that one membrane responds to the signal that triggers autophagosome formation and the identity of that membrane has remained elusive. Our isolation of the ERGIC as the locus of LC3 lipidation is in line with morphological studies that describe an omegasome structure projecting directly from the ER membrane (<a href=\"#bib3\">Axe et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009</a>).

ATG14 has been reported to sense membrane curvature via an amphipathic alpha helix located in a C-terminal \u2018BATS\u2019 domain (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fan et al., 2011</a>). In yeast, it has been shown that highly curved membranes positive for ATG9 are delivered to the PAS (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mari et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nair et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Yamamoto et al., 2012</a>). Subsequently, the curvature sensing protein Atg1 recruits Atg13 and the Atg17\u201331\u201329 protein complex to initiate the formation of the phagophore (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ragusa et al., 2012</a>). The suggested requirement for a tubular membrane together with the possible existence of an integral membrane protein(s) that triggers ATG14 recruitment are now open for biochemical analysis."

Nonetheless, we have performed a protease protection assay hoping to observe the progressive enclosure of lipidated LC3 within a sealed compartment as might be expected when the autophagosome precursor membrane closes to segregate cytosolic components. Unfortunately, on repeated tests in prolonged incubations, we find little evidence for reproducible protease protection of the LC3-II species. We are not discouraged by this because the overall pathway is likely to be quite complex, including the fusion of additional membranes carrying such proteins as ATG9 (which is missing from our enriched ERGIC membrane), as well as a substantial morphological transformation from a membrane sheet into a closed concentric membrane sphere. An alternative strategy could be to start with membranes from an <i>Atg</i> null cell line blocked at a distinctly later step in the pathway. We hope the reviewers will appreciate that this is beyond the scope of this paper, which we believe is already quite complex."
