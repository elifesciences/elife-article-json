Conflicting studies have identified tumor-restricting and tumor-promoting roles of PDAC-associated desmoplasia, suggesting that individual CAF/D-ECM protein constituents have distinguishable tumorigenic and tumor-repressive functions. Using 3D culture of normal pancreatic versus PDAC-associated human fibroblasts, we identified a CAF/D-ECM phenotype that correlates with improved patient outcomes, and that includes CAFs enriched in plasma membrane-localized, active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin. Mechanistically, we established that TGF\u03b2 is required for D-ECM production but dispensable for D-ECM-induced na\u00efve fibroblast-to-CAF activation, which depends on \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin redistribution of pFAK-independent active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin to assorted endosomes. Importantly, the development of a simultaneous multi-channel immunofluorescence approach and new algorithms for computational batch-analysis and their application to a human PDAC panel, indicated that stromal localization and levels of active SMAD2/3 and \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin distinguish patient-protective from patient-detrimental desmoplasia and foretell tumor recurrences, suggesting a useful new prognostic tool."

Conflicting studies have identified tumor-restricting and tumor-promoting roles of PDAC-associated desmoplasia, suggesting that individual CAF/D-ECM protein constituents have distinguishable tumorigenic and tumor-repressive functions. Using 3D culture of normal pancreatic versus PDAC-associated human fibroblasts, we identified a CAF/D-ECM phenotype that correlates with improved patient outcomes, and that includes CAFs enriched in plasma membrane-localized, active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin. Mechanistically, we established that TGF\u03b2 is required for D-ECM production but dispensable for D-ECM-induced na\u00efve fibroblast-to-CAF activation, which depends on \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin redistribution of pFAK-independent active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin to assorted endosomes. Importantly, the development of a simultaneous multi-channel immunofluorescence approach and new algorithms for computational batch-analysis and their application to a human PDAC panel, indicated that stromal localization and levels of active SMAD2/3 and \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin distinguish patient-protective from patient-detrimental desmoplasia and foretell tumor recurrences, suggesting a useful new prognostic tool."

By contrast, the emergence of a desmoplastic (activated) stroma, encompassing fibrotic-like modifications of local and recruited fibroblasts based on tumor interactions with the local microenvironment, has been proposed to play a major role in the development and progression of solid tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and others (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bijlsma and van Laarhoven, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Jonasch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Erkan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Xu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Gupta et al., 2011</a>). Many studies suggest that a fibrotic reaction, such as that\u00a0seen in pancreatitis, drives a pro-tumorigenic wound-healing response that often precedes tumor development (<a href=\"#bib95\">Whitcomb and Pogue-Geile, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Binkley et al., 2004</a>). Tumor\u00a0fibrosis, also known as desmoplasia, has been reported to promote tumorigenesis, providing chemoresistance and shielding tumors from therapeutic agents (<a href=\"#bib66\">Olive et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ireland et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Laklai et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Koay et al., 2014</a>). A mechanism of \u2018stromal reciprocation\u2019, involving mutual signaling between tumor and neighboring cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that promotes tumor growth, has been demonstrated for PDAC (<a href=\"#bib89\">Tape et al., 2016</a>). On the basis of these findings, several studies have attempted complete ablation of desmoplastic stroma as a therapeutic approach to limit tumor growth, but paradoxically,\u00a0this resulted in the\u00a0evolution of existing tumors to a more aggressive state, and accelerated rates of tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib68\">\u00d6zdemir et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Rhim et al., 2014</a>).

We also found that D-ECM controls \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin signaling, which prompts the accumulation of activated, but FAK-independent, \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1-</sub>integrin pools in specific intracellular vesicles. This D-ECM control of \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin signaling prevents the\u00a0enrichment of active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin at the plasma membrane (PM), where \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> activity opposes myofibroblastic activation. Using a novel integrative approach combining multi-colored immunofluorescence and a new quantitative algorithm, we first validated our <i>in vitro</i> findings and then applied this process to annotated clinical samples.

These signatures help clarify the controversial role of desmoplasia in the progression of cancer. Further, insofar as reversion of D-ECM has been suggested have the potential to confer significant clinical benefit (<a href=\"#bib87\">Stromnes et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Whatcott et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Neuzillet et al., 2015</a>), these data suggest potential therapies to stabilize patient-protective or to\u00a0revert patient-detrimental stroma."

Levels of TGF\u03b2 in D-ECM were\u00a0~2 fold higher than in N-ECM or D-ECM produced in the presence of SB-431542 (D+TGF\u03b2i in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Importantly, following SB-431542 treatment, CAFs produced isotropic ECMs that were phenotypically indistinguishable from intact N-ECMs (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>). This result differed from that produced by the treatment of control na\u00efve pancreatic stellate cells with SB-431542, which\u00a0produced interrupted TGF\u03b2 signaling that\u00a0caused complete loss of fibrillogenesis, resulting in the\u00a0absence of matrix production (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Using primary human na\u00efve fibroblastic cells, we have previously shown that the residual three-dimensional (3D) D-ECM produced by CAFs is sufficient to induce a myofibroblastic phenotype (<a href=\"#bib4\">Amatangelo et al., 2005</a>). Applying this analysis to pancreatic extracted matrices, we found that\u00a0D-ECM produced by CAFs in the presence of TGF\u03b2 blockade was similar to N-ECM in being incapable of inducing <i>de novo</i> myofibroblastic activation (as reflected by increased \u03b1SMA stress fiber localization and protein levels) in na\u00efve fibroblastic stellate cells.\u00a0By\u00a0contrast,untreated and control treated D-ECM\u00a0effectively induced such activation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

We first established that both of these integrin heterodimers were highly abundant, compared to other \u03b2-integrins, on the PMs of human na\u00efve pancreatic stellate cells and of PDAC-associated CAFs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To determine\u00a0whether either or both of these heterodimers is essential for D-ECM induction of myofibroblastic conversion, na\u00efve fibroblastic stellate cells were plated overnight on N-ECM or D-ECM in the presence of integrin-inhibitory or negative control antibodies. ALULA, a highly specific \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin-blocking antibody (<a href=\"#bib88\">Su et al., 2007</a>), eliminated the ability of D-ECM to induce \u03b1SMA stress fiber localization (and expression) beyond levels induced by N-ECM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). By contrast, mAb16, which specifically blocks human \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akiyama et al., 1989</a>), had limited effects on D-ECM induction of \u03b1SMA localization (or expression), with na\u00efve cells undergoing robust myofibroblastic conversion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). Intriguingly, combined application of ALULA and mAb16 eliminated the effects of \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin inhibition seen with ALULA alone, with na\u00efve cells undergoing robust myofibroblastic transition similar to that\u00a0in\u00a0untreated and IgG controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>).

Checkmarks identify conditions that resulted in myofibroblastic activation, while Xs identify conditions that did not result in myofibroblastic activation. (<b>G</b>) Model of D-ECM-induced activation of na\u00efve fibroblasts, dependent on the activity of integrins \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub> and \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>. Inhibition of \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5-</sub> integrin results in release of active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin, leading to blockade of D-ECM-induced myofibroblastic activation (1<sup>st</sup> arrow, red X). The activity of \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5-</sub> integrin is no longer needed in the absence of \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity, suggesting that \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity in not necessary for fibroblasts to undergo D-ECM-induced myofibroblastic activation (2<sup>nd</sup> arrow, green checkmark). Double inhibition of \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin and \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin results in D-ECM myofibroblastic activation, which proposes that inhibition of \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin can overcome or rescue the effects seen under \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin inhibition (3<sup>rd</sup> arrow, green checkmark). Stabilization of \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin in its active conformation overcomes the inhibitory/regulatory effects imparted by \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin, resulting in ineffective D-ECM-induced myofibroblastic activation (4<sup>th</sup> arrow, red X). Overall, the model suggests that D-ECM induces \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>- integrin activity, which in turn results in the regulation of active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin, allowing D-ECM-induced myofibroblastic activation (large arrow to the right, green checkmark)."

For this, we asked whether stabilizing the activity of \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin could phenocopy \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin inhibition. We found that SNAKA51, an activating antibody that stabilizes the active conformation of \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Clark et al., 2005</a>), reduced the ability of D-ECM to induce \u03b1SMA stress fiber localization (and expression) in na\u00efve stellate cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). As an independent approach to simulate ALULA-dependent inhibition of \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin, we used Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-editing to generate a series of na\u00efve stellate cells in which the \u03b2<sub>5</sub>, \u03b1<sub>5,</sub> \u03b1<sub>v</sub> or \u03b2<sub>3</sub> (a negative control) integrin subunits were ablated (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>). Cells lacking the \u03b2<sub>5</sub> subunit had a greatly diminished response to D-ECM, with very limited induction of \u03b1SMA stress fiber localization (and expression) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By contrast, loss of \u03b1<sub>5</sub>-, \u03b1<sub>v</sub>- or \u03b2<sub>3</sub>-integrin profoundly reduced growth of na\u00efve fibroblasts, yielding slow-growing cells that were also unable to respond to D-ECM. The slow growth and poor condition of the additional KO cells suggests pleiotropic roles for these integrin subunits in supporting cell viability, and thus makes it difficult to draw conclusions. Nonetheless, the\u00a0results do not rule out a role for \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity, regulated by D-ECM control of \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin, that\u00a0opposes\u00a0the stimulation of\u00a0the na\u00efve-to-myofibroblastic transition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>)."

In contrast to results with TGF\u03b2 blockade, neither \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin inhibition (with ALULA) nor stabilization of active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin (with SNAKA51) altered the anisotropic fiber formation in D-ECM deposited by CAFs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), or the ability of these matrices to induce myofibroblastic activation in na\u00efve fibroblastic stellate cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also analyzed\u00a0the ECM produced by CRISPR-edited CAFs lacking specific integrin subunits. In contrast to results with integrin inhibition, CAFs lacking \u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin or \u03b1<sub>5</sub>-integrin subunits had decreased \u03b1SMA expression and localization of \u03b1SMA to stress fibers. Loss of \u03b2<sub>5</sub> expression also affected levels of D-ECM anisotropy, while CAFs lacking \u03b1<sub>5</sub> failed to produce substantial matrices (matching earlier reports [<a href=\"#bib70\">Pankov et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">McDonald et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Fogerty et al., 1990</a>]) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, loss of \u03b1<sub>v</sub>-integrin caused significant reduction in the\u00a0ability to produce D-ECM, while loss of the negative control, \u03b2<sub>3</sub>, had no effect on this phenotype (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results suggested that the ability of CAFs to grow and produce functional D-ECMs was selectively affected by loss of \u03b1<sub>5</sub>, \u03b1<sub>v</sub> and \u03b2<sub>5</sub> integrin subunits but not by \u03b2<sub>3</sub> loss."

As an independent approach to confirm this result, double immunogold labeling of 3D-adhesions with mAb11 and active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin with SNAKA51 was analyzed by transmitted electron microscopy of na\u00efve fibroblastic stellate cells cultured within N-ECM, or of\u00a0fibroblasts cultured in D-ECM while being\u00a0treated with the \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin inhibiting antibody ALULA or a\u00a0control antibody. D-ECM\u00a0induced the\u00a0intracellular enrichment of the active integrin in discrete punctate structures, which probably reflected endosomes that did not include recognizable clathrin-coated pits. Conversely, inhibition of \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin reduced the accumulation of active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin intracellular pools, with most signal localized to the PM (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Supporting this mechanism in an independent model, the relocation of active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin from intracellular to PM locations following culture within intact D-ECM was also observed in na\u00efve \u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin KO fibroblastic stellate cells that\u00a0were\u00a0compared to control na\u00efve fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

RCC stroma is of particular interest because it encompasses a microenvironment that is highly angiogenic and that physically intercalates with cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib57\">Lohi et al., 1998</a>), thus distinguishing it from the desmoplasia seen in PDAC. We first demonstrated that renal (r) fibroblasts include an\u00a0overrepresentation of \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> and \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub> integrins relative to alternative \u03b2-integrin heterodimers at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Na\u00efve r-fibroblasts expressed low levels of \u03b1SMA (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B\u2013C</a>) and produced isotropic rN-ECM\u00a0when\u00a0compared to rCAF-derived matrices, which produced anisotropic rD-ECM (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As with PDAC CAFs, treating rCAFs with a TGF\u03b2 inhibitor (SB-431542) during ECM production caused cells to produce isotropic matrices (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Overnight plating of na\u00efve r-fibroblasts in rD-ECM\u00a0induced the\u00a0formation of myofibroblastic features such as an increase in stress-fiber-localized \u03b1SMA, as compared to cells plated in rN-ECM. Further, the isotropic 3D matrices produced by TGF\u03b2R1-inhibited rCAFs failed to induce na\u00efve-to-myofibroblastic activation, whereas TGF\u03b2 signaling activity was dispensable in na\u00efve fibroblasts undergoing myofibroblastic activation in response to intact rD-ECM\u00a0induction."

                                "text": "In addition, as with the pancreatic model, regulation of active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin by \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin was needed for na\u00efve fibroblasts to undergo rD-ECM-induced myofibroblastic activation (<a href=\"#fig11s2\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). Accordingly, treatment of na\u00efve r-fibroblasts seeded within rD-ECM in the presence of small molecule FAK inhibitor PF573,228 (<a href=\"#bib85\">Slack-Davis et al., 2007</a>), blocked acquisition of myofibroblastic traits (<a href=\"#fig11s3\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In na\u00efve r-fibroblasts, concomitant FAK and \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin inhibition with combined PF573,228 and mAb16 significantly increased rD-ECM-induced myofibroblastic activation compared to PF573,228 treatment alone. Again, effects similar to those observed in the PDAC system\u00a0were\u00a0seen: \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin co-inhibition with FAK failed to rescue rD-ECM na\u00efve-to-myofibroblastic conversion (<a href=\"#fig11s3\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Also, pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup> levels measured in 3D-adhesions of na\u00efve r-fibroblasts induced by rD-ECM were effectively reduced in the presence of \u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin inhibitor (ALULA [<a href=\"#bib88\">Su et al., 2007</a>]), rendering pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup> levels similar to N-ECM levels (<a href=\"#fig11s4\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Culturing na\u00efve r-fibroblasts in rD-ECM triggered lengthening of 3D-adhesion structures compared to those\u00a0in\u00a0rN-ECM, and this was effectively prevented by stabilization of \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity using SNAKA51 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Clark et al., 2005</a>) (<a href=\"#fig11s5\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Last, plating na\u00efve r-fibroblasts in rD-ECM increased levels of active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin that was localized away from 3D-adhesion structures compared to those\u00a0in\u00a0rN-ECM. These levels\u00a0were regulated by \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin, as treatment with ALULA restricted the enrichment of \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity in areas lacking adhesions (<a href=\"#fig11s6\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 6</a>)."

Such bidirectional signaling is not simulated in the <i>in vitro</i> stroma 3D model used for the analysis described above. To extend our findings, we assessed whether the results we established <i>in vitro</i> were reflected <i>in vivo</i> in the original surgical samples used to harvest fibroblasts. We investigated whether the integrin redistribution phenotype that was commonly observed in both na\u00efve fibroblasts in response to D-ECM and CAFs during D-ECM production <i>in vitro</i>, was also evident in the <i>in vivo</i> tumor-associated stroma. First, optimizing conditions <i>in vitro</i>, we used a simultaneous multi-channel immunofluorescence (SMI) approach, coupled with SMIA-CUKIE, to perform quantitative parallel analysis of seven relevant biomarkers in CAFs or control normal pancreatic stellate cells at the endpoint of production of D-ECM or N-ECM, respectively. These included a master mix (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) of epithelial and tumor cell markers (cyan; note, absent from <i>in vitro</i> specimens), the stromal marker vimentin (magenta), a nucleus-detecting DNA intercalating agent (Draq5, yellow), a 3D-adhesion marker (mAb11 [<a href=\"#bib18\">Cukierman et al., 2001</a>], red)\u00a0and SNAKA51 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Clark et al., 2005</a>) to detect levels and localizations of active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin (green), anti-pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup> (orange) and anti-pSMAD2/3 (indicative of TGF\u03b2 pathway activation [<a href=\"#bib90\">Tsukazaki et al., 1998</a>]; blue)."

TGF\u03b2 activation also increased during the\u00a0production of D-ECM, represented by augmented total and nuclear pSMAD2/3 levels, when compared to na\u00efve/normal cultures in which active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin mostly localizes at 3D-adhesion sites during N-ECM matrix production (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>).

While normal pancreatic and renal 3D cultures included active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin that is mostly localized at 3D-adhesion locations and included relatively low pFAK and pSMAD2/3 levels, PDAC and RCC CAF 3D matrix-producing cultures again exhibited high active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin levels that were evident at locations away from 3D-adhesions, concomitant with increased pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup>, and nuclei that were enriched with pSMAD2/3 (<a href=\"#fig12s1\">Figure 12\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

For this, we conducted high-throughput SMI image acquisition and SMIA-CUKIE analysis of TMA PDAC samples, using univariate CART methodology to integrate the\u00a0reporting levels\u00a0of\u00a0numerical outputs and intersections of the seven biomarkers of interest with OS or RFS. We observed significantly shorter OS in tumor surgical samples that\u00a0had high stromal pSMAD2/3 values, whether values were quantified as mean or median stromal pSMAD2/3 intensity levels (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>). Even though many patients did not show clinical improvement following surgery (so that our cohort presented a bias towards fast recurrence), high stromal pSMAD2/3 levels also correlated with shorter RFS (<a href=\"#fig13s1\">Figure 13\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, higher mean quantified levels of stromal \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity also correlated significantly\u00a0with longer RFS (<a href=\"#fig13s2\">Figure 13\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Interestingly, longer times to recurrence following surgery, quantified as the percentage area coverage relative to stromal occupied areas or as integrated intensities, were significantly associated with increased levels of integrin activity localized to stromal 3D-adhesion positive locations (<a href=\"#fig13s2\">Figure 13\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). These results suggest that stromal activation of TGF\u03b2, represented by high stromal pSMAD2/3 levels and indicative of capacity for active production of D-ECM production, is a prognostic stromal trait for poor outcome, while increased stromal levels of active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin at 3D adhesion positive areas may constitute a patient-protective PDAC-associated desmoplastic phenotype."

These results indicate that TGF\u03b2 contributes to N-ECM assembly, and that it is essential solely for the phenotypic remodeling required for conversion to anisotropic D-ECM, but not for\u00a0secretion of ECM components per se in the context of D-ECM production. This fact is supported by the observation that CAFs require TGF\u03b2 signaling for the myofibroblastic production of anisotropic D-ECM and for\u00a0expression of \u03b1SMA, while the myofibroblastic features that are acquired by normal/na\u00efve fibroblasts in response to D-ECM do not entail this signaling pathway. Second, our work addressed two cell-ECM receptor integrin heterodimers that have previously been shown to influence myofibroblastic activation, \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub> and \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Asano et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Lygoe et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dugina et al., 2001</a>). Our study shows that both of these integrin heterodimers are abundant on the surface of both na\u00efve fibroblasts and CAFs, but have distinct roles in the ability of na\u00efve fibroblasts to respond to and of\u00a0CAFs to assemble anisotropic D-ECM. In particular, our work integrated multiple approaches to emphasize an important role for \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin in the response of na\u00efve fibroblasts to D-ECM and for CAFs in\u00a0producing anisotropic matrix. We also found that while \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> counteracted the response of na\u00efve fibroblasts to D-ECM,\u00a0it\u00a0was, not surprisingly, essential for matrix fibrillogenesis. Interestingly, in the context of extracted D-ECM imparting na\u00efve-to-myofibroblastic activation, cross-signaling between the two integrins was apparent, with \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub> regulating the internalization of part of the elevated pool of activated \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> to intracellular endosomal compartments (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a>). Third, we also defined specific ECM responses as independent of, or dependent on, the canonical integrin effector FAK. Fourth, importantly, we demonstrated that the signaling relationships identified in this study were valid in multiple model systems, including human primary PDAC and RCC, as well as additional murine models. Fifth, we used high-content imaging and data analysis to demonstrate that interactions analyzed <i>in vitro</i> can be used to define an <i>in vivo</i> stromal signature that has prognostic value, addressing a significant clinical goal."

Consequently, the non-pathological N-ECM spares regulation of \u03b1<sub>V</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin activity and assures physiological accumulation of low active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin levels at the PM, rendering fibroblasts inactive.

Remodeling that causes isotropic ECMs to become increasingly anisotropic, together with increases in matrix tension and stiffness, are all features of chronic fibrosis that physically enhance the accessibility and activation of TGF\u03b2 by myofibroblastic integrins (<a href=\"#bib49\">Klingberg et al., 2014</a>). Another interesting study demonstrated that substrate stiffness influences the ability of a cell induced <i>in vitro</i> to undergo myofibroblastic activation,\u00a0and can positively or negatively influence the degree to which a cell is able to accurately acquire the\u00a0characteristics (<a href=\"#bib1\">Achterberg et al., 2014</a>) of a CAF<i>\u00a0in vivo</i>. In accord with this line of thinking, one may argue that specific ECM topographies, and in particular the overall physical properties of cell substrates, play key pathophysiological roles in promoting positive feedback loops involving myofibroblastic cells and D-ECMs in fibrous tumor-associated microenvironments, such as PDAC-associated desmoplasia (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alexander and Cukierman, 2016</a>). Our results indicated that while TGF\u03b2 is necessary for normal fibroblasts to assemble N-ECM, it is essential solely for the phenotypic remodeling of anisotropic D-ECM by CAFs, and not\u00a0for its production. Negating CAF capability to produce anisotropic D-ECM restricts tumor growth <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Goreczny et al., 2016</a>), while increased levels of anisotropic D-ECM correlate with poor patient survival and cancer relapse (<a href=\"#bib33\">Goetz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Conklin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bredfeldt et al., 2014</a>). Inhibition of the TGF\u03b2 type I receptor, which reduces the activity of a downstream canonical effector of TGF\u03b2, SMAD2/3, is known to hinder matrix fibrillogenesis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Callahan et al., 2002</a>). In our work, elevated fibroblast-expressed pSMAD2/3 and nuclear translocation of this protein in CAFs producing D-ECM correlated with short time to recurrence and reduced survival in both PDAC and RCC patient cohorts. Results from our study also suggest that while TGF\u03b2-targeted therapeutic interventions may revert D-ECMs to their naturally tumor-suppressive isotropic phenotype, the same approach could ablate homeostatic N-ECM. Consideration of this possibility is important because total ablation of TGF\u03b2 induces multifocal inflammatory disease (<a href=\"#bib84\">Shull et al., 1992</a>) and because clinical trials are currently assessing TGF\u03b2-inhibitory drugs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Herbertz et al., 2015</a>)."

In addition, genetic loss (but not transient inhibition) of \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>, which resulted\u00a0in slow-growing na\u00efve cells, altogether prevented <i>de novo</i> D-ECM induction of na\u00efve-to-myofibroblastic transition.

Other studies have shown that inhibition of \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>-integrin activates \u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin, counteracting ECM-dependent myofibroblastic \u03b1SMA stress fiber localization (<a href=\"#bib92\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). However, the nature of the specific \u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin heterodimer and the mechanistic details of this negative myofibroblastic regulation were\u00a0previously\u00a0unknown. We further defined the \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> activity that regulates \u03b1SMA localization as independent of FAK. Interestingly, a previously defined \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin activity needed to form 3D-adhesions in both normal cell-derived ECMs and <i>in vivo</i> is also FAK-independent (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cukierman et al., 2001</a>)."

The new software developed in this study to facilitate analysis of the\u00a0discrete localizations of the various markers specifically in stroma (freely downloadable from <a href=\"https://github.com/cukie/SMIA_CUKIE\">https://github.com/cukie/SMIA_CUKIE</a>) allows analysis of batch-sorted monochromatic images in bulk, and generation of qualitative and quantitative outputs to evaluate biomarkers located at any given mask and/or marker intersection. In this study, we used this software to identify predictive biomarker signatures for PDAC and RCC patients. Stromal increases in pSMAD2/3 and pFAK correlated with worse outcomes but, in spite of the bias introduced by the use of resectable surgical cases, we identified a patient-protective stroma phenotype in PDAC, in which increased active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin selectively localized at stromal 3D-adhesions is associated with improved outcomes. By contrast, intensities of active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity correlated with increasingly unfavorable OS as well as DSS in RCC patients. Hence, locations and intensities of stromal \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity concomitant with constitutive active pFAK-Y<sup>397</sup> could represent novel desmoplasia-dependent outcome-predicting stromal patterns. As our <i>in vitro</i> studies suggested a complex function for \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin activity, and given the differences between the\u00a0molecular characteristics of distinct tumor subtypes, we emphasize that individual tumor classes will require careful study before\u00a0these biomarkers could be used as predictive clinical indicators."

To overcome this problem, images were collected using Caliper\u2019s multispectral imaging system (PerkinElmer), which utilizes a unique imaging module with Tunable Liquid Crystal. Two different systems namely Nuance-FX (for 40x objective) and Vectra (for 20x objective and high throughput) were used depending on the acquisition needs. A wavelength-based spectral library for each system and each tissue type (i.e., pancreas and kidney) was created by staining control sections with individual fluorophores or\u00a0by\u00a0mock treating samples to include the specific autofluorescence spectra. Once a spectral library was constructed for\u00a0each organ type, it was saved and used for the subsequent image acquisition and analysis. All excitations were achieved via a\u00a0high-intensity mercury lamp using the following filters (emission-excitation): for Nuance, DAPI (450-720), FITC (500-720), TRITC (580-720), CY5 (680-720); for Vectra, DAPI (440-680), FITC (500-680), TRITC (570-690), CY5 (680-720). For emissions collection, \u2018DAPI\u2019 filter (wavelength range 450\u2013720) was used for all Q-dot labeled markers, while masks used the conventional FITC, TRITC, and CY5 filters. After collecting all image cubes (including all channels), images were unmixed to obtain 16-bit greyscale individual stains monochromatic files. Using Photoshop\u2019s 'Levels' and 'Batch Conversion' functions, the images were processed in bulk to render identically scaled 8-bit monochromatic images for\u00a0each channel. The resulting images were sampled to set identical threshold values for each channel, which were used to feed the values needed for analyses in SMIA-CUKIE to\u00a0signify positive-labeled pixels."

The newly written software, available at <a href=\"https://github.com/cukie/SMIA_CUKIE\">https://github.com/cukie/SMIA_CUKIE</a>, was created to bulk process and analyze batches of monochromatic images providing localization (masks), intensities, and similar quantifying values (markers), including co-localizations of multichannel monochromatic immunofluorescent (or IHC, etc.) images. The software can identify intersection areas between an unlimited amount of masks, while queried marker values and locations can also be estimated for numerous interrogations. The software requires the\u00a0identification of common nomenclatures to recognize each type of monochromatic image (i.e vim for vimentin etc.). It also needs information regarding the available number of masks and markers deposited in the batch folders containing the images. In this work, three masks were used corresponding to nuclei, epithelium/tumor and stroma, as well as two markers corresponding to adhesion structures and active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin. For each of the masks and markers, the software requires a numeric threshold (0-255), which indicates the value of pixel intensity that is to be considered positive for each channel (corresponding to each mask and marker). The software then allows choosing amongst all possible query combinations. Alternatively, it provides an option for the user to write the desired tests to be queried. For example, when active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin values were requested at <i>bona fide</i> stromal locations, the software was instructed to look for \u2018SNAKA under vimentin, NOTepi/tumor\u2019. In this example, \u2018SNAKA\u2019 was the nomenclature we used for the active integrin channel while vimentin and epi/tumor served as masks. After running this function, the software rendered an Excel file containing values of area coverage for the marker at the requested mask intersection (stroma), as well as total area coverage related to the image. Similarly, values included mean, median, standard deviation, total and integrated intensities. In addition, the software can be instructed to provide image outputs corresponding to requested mask locations, as well as markers shown solely at the corresponding mask intersections (as shown in <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a> and <a href=\"#fig12s2\">Figure 12 \u2013figure supplement 2</a>).

First, in order to produce functional retrovirus, packaging cells Phoenix-Amphotropic (\u03c6NX) (ATCC # CRL-3213) at 50% confluence in 10 cm culture dishes were transfected with 10 ug pBABE-neo-hTERT vector using 10 uL Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, #18324) and 40 uL of Plus Reagent (Invitrogen, # 11514015) in 6 mL serum/antibiotics free Opti-MEM (Gibco, # 31985062) culture media overnight at 37\u00b0C in a cell culture incubator.

Fibroblasts were then selected with G-418 at a concentration of 750 \u03bcg/mL until cells grew back to\u00a0~90% confluence. Cells were then expanded and tested for overexpression of hTERT, and lack of p16, by western blotting to confirm hTERT overexpression.

The unified CART framework that embeds recursive binary partitioning into the theory of permutation tests was used. Significance-testing procedures were applied to determine whether no significant association between any of the clinical variables and the response could be stated, or whether the recursion would need to stop. Also, log-rank tests and univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards (PH) were used to correlate clinical and laboratory variables with survival; hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated, as appropriate, for various comparisons. Goodness-of-fit of the PH model was evaluated based on Schoenfeld residuals. In order to account for potential batch effects, a \u2018batch\u2019 variable was included as an adjustment variable in all the analyses that were pertinent to the PDAC cohort. All tests were two-sided and used a significance level of 5% to test each hypothesis. Significant p-values in all figures were denoted by asterisks as follows: ****p&lt;0.0001 extremely significant, ***p=0.0001\u20130.01 very significant, **p=0.01\u20130.05 significant and *p=0.05\u20130.10 marginally significant.

In particular, recent studies evaluating pancreatic cancer have highlighted this issue by further confirming that normal fibroblasts can restrain disease; findings that have been reasonably well described in other solid tumors. Further, strong consensus evidence in pancreatic cancer and numerous other solid tumors indicates a disease promoting role for activated myofibroblasts in the stroma. In the current work the authors undertake focused studies to evaluate this dual role of fibroblasts and elucidate fundamental mechanisms driving these distinct behaviors. Franco-Barraza and colleagues have investigated the underlying mechanisms of PDAC desmoplasia by generating 3D in vitro cell derived matrixes from normal fibroblasts (to generate N-ECM) and PDAC CAFs to generate D-ECM (desmoplastic ECM). They find that TGFb signalling is essential for D-ECM production but dispensable for the ability of the D-ECM to covert na\u00efve fibroblasts to activated myofibroblasts. They find that in response to PDAC-associated D-ECM, \u03b1v\u03b25-integrin re-distributes active \u03b15\u03b21-integrin away from pFAK-Y397 positive 3D-adhesions and, thus, promotes myofibroblastic activation whereas inhibition of avb5 under these conditions was protective against myofibroblasts activation by increasing active a5b1 location to the cell surface. They also have data from human PDAC and RCC investigating whether levels of FAK and \u03b15\u03b21 integrin can distinguish tumor suppressive v tumor promoting stroma."

Combined with the seemingly arbitrary cut-off for low vs. high (rather than above and below median which might be considered standard), this effectively leaves 3 patients with low stromal active \u03b15\u03b21 at 3D-adh. The authors then claim RFS benefits of about 11 months with high stromal active \u03b15\u03b21 at 3D-adh, but the median of those patients is about 11 months, compared with the survival of the 3 'low' patients at 10, 10 and 19 months."

For instance, what is really changing when TGF-\u03b2 signaling is blocked? Are the activated myofibroblasts in general reverting to a more phenotypically quiescent state, is ECM secretion changing resulting in fundamentally different ECM composition, are the CAFs simply less contractile or polarized etc.? While this reviewer fully understands that each of these factors cannot be examined in detail in the current work, a more encompassing discussion of these potential shifts would improve the manuscript. Likewise, if data exists from evaluating these cultures over time it would strengthen the manuscript. Further, the data suggests that the differential influence of the N v D ECM is largely due to the differences in ECM alignment. Can a case be made that this is the dominant factor or one of the critical factors?"

Could a similar mechanism be involved in the ALULA-driven increase of a5b1 in 3D adhesions? This should be at least discussed."

We tested all normal cells for their response to desmoplastic-ECM (D-ECM) and tested all D-ECMs for their phenotype and function, and for each, evaluated the ability of a TGFbeta receptor inhibitor during matrix production to reverse their ability to produce functional D-ECM (see new <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> and new <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In this revision, we have enlarged our analytic cohort of PDAC specimens (making the RFS data more reliable), and analyzed more markers that are less subject to localization control, and hence potentially more robust. We now clearly show that active TGFbeta signaling, represented by levels of pSMAD2/3 at stromal (but not tumor) locations, correspond with significantly lower OS times. Statistical analysis indicates that SMAD2/3 and active \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>-integrin at 3D adhesion positive areas were each separately significant in prediction of RFS, even given the limitations of the data set. We believe that future studies using larger numbers of samples and examining additional markers will result in significant protective OS outcomes, since we did observe some trends which did not reach statistical significance."
