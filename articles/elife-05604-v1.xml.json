These shifting biotic pressures generate heterogeneous selective forces that can maintain standing natural variation within a species. To directly test if genes containing causal variation for the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> defensive compounds, glucosinolates (GSL) control field fitness and are therefore subject to natural selection, we conducted a multi-year field trial using lines that vary in only specific causal genes. Interestingly, we found that variation in these naturally polymorphic GSL genes affected fitness in each of our environments but the pattern fluctuated such that highly fit genotypes in one trial displayed lower fitness in another and that no GSL genotype or genotypes consistently out-performed the others. This was true both across locations and within the same location across years. These results indicate that environmental heterogeneity may contribute to the maintenance of GSL variation observed within <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>."

These shifting biotic pressures generate heterogeneous selective forces that can maintain standing natural variation within a species. To directly test if genes containing causal variation for the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> defensive compounds, glucosinolates (GSL) control field fitness and are therefore subject to natural selection, we conducted a multi-year field trial using lines that vary in only specific causal genes. Interestingly, we found that variation in these naturally polymorphic GSL genes affected fitness in each of our environments but the pattern fluctuated such that highly fit genotypes in one trial displayed lower fitness in another and that no GSL genotype or genotypes consistently out-performed the others. This was true both across locations and within the same location across years. These results indicate that environmental heterogeneity may contribute to the maintenance of GSL variation observed within <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>."

This is particularly true for the model species <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, which exhibits variation both within and among natural populations and/or accessions (<a href=\"#bib78\">Pigliucci and Marlow, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Atwell et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bomblies et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Platt et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Debieu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Joseph et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Long et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Anwer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Li et al., 2014</a>). Models based on mutation-selection balance theory predict that this observed variation will be due to rare alleles at many loci introduced through random mutations that evolution acts on to eliminate through persistent purifying natural selection (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kimura, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Turelli, 1984</a>). In agreement, studies of nucleotide variation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> have found an excess of low frequency polymorphisms relative to expectation (<a href=\"#bib81\">Purugganan &amp; Suddith, 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib82\">1999</a>). However, other studies cloning causal genetic variants from natural <i>Arabidopsis</i> accessions have found several intriguing examples of intermediate frequency alleles maintained at polymorphic loci (<a href=\"#bib41\">Johanson et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Long et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Li et al., 2014</a>). This variation among loci has led to a long-standing interest in elucidating to what extent this genetic variation is neutral in origin or, alternatively, maintained through selective forces (<a href=\"#bib56\">Levene, 1953</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hedrick et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Bull, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Stahl et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Prasad et al., 2012</a>)."

This hypothesis has generated numerous modeling studies demonstrating that the standing level of genetic variation in traits can be explained by the demographic history of a species not linked to fitness of an individual (<a href=\"#bib103\">Wolf et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Barton and Turelli, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hufford et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Pyhajarvi et al., 2013</a>). However, for many ecologically important traits, phenotypic variation has been shown to empirically impact fitness in natural populations, suggesting that natural selection also plays an important role in the evolution of such traits (<a href=\"#bib74\">Mothershead and Marquis, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adler et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Tian et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Korves et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Milla et al., 2009</a>). A key step necessary to begin to resolve these discrepancies between theory and empirical observations requires the validation of fitness consequences of variation at specific loci or pathways in the field (<a href=\"#bib95\">Turelli and Barton, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Fournier-Level et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hancock et al., 2011</a>)."

However, most population level studies of evolution and selection in the field have focused on polygenic populations and have been unable to validate the link between variation at specific underlying genes and the resulting fitness consequences of this variation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lande and Arnold, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Mitchell-Olds and Rutledge, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gillespie and Turelli, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Orr, 1998</a>). Studies using structured mapping populations, such as <i>Arabidopsis</i> RILs, can only associate large genomic regions, rather than individual genes, with quantitative variation in fitness (<a href=\"#bib100\">Weinig et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Stinchcombe et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Juenger et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Malmberg et al., 2005</a>). More recently, genome wide studies using <i>A. thaliana</i> accessions have been able to associate SNPs to fitness in the field and even predict relative fitness of accessions grown in a common garden (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fournier-Level et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hancock et al., 2011</a>). However, these associations between loci and fitness need more refining to validate the effect of individual genes. Testing if individual genes impact fitness in the field first requires identifying and cloning the causal genes underlying the phenotypic variation of interest (<a href=\"#bib72\">Mitchell-Olds, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Tian et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Mitchell-Olds et al., 2007</a>). Then, these natural alleles need to be recreated as single gene lines, which can require approaches such as chemical mutation (e.g., EMS), generation of transgenic individuals via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and/or generation of isogenic lines through successive rounds of backcrossing. Therefore, empirical field testing of individual causative polymorphic genes has only been done rarely, and we do not yet have a good understanding of the extent to which individual genes impact fitness in the field (<a href=\"#bib93\">Tian et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Schuman et al., 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "<i>A. thaliana</i> has become a key model system and is extremely suitable for characterizing, cloning and validating genes influencing the fitness consequences of underlying natural variation. This is due, in part, to the ease of transformation as well as the abundance of genomic resources available for this organism, including an extensive library of T-DNA insertion lines and natural accessions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alonso et al., 2003</a>). <i>Arabidopsis</i> persists in many different environments and experiences selection from both abiotic pressures, such as temperature and precipitation, and biotic pressures, such as insect and pathogen populations that vary temporally and spatially (<a href=\"#bib67\">Meyerowitz, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Richards et al., 2009</a>). Potentially to maximize fitness across a broad range of biotia, <i>Arabidopsis</i> has evolved high levels of natural variation among accessions for many important phenotypic traits, including the defense compounds, glucosinolates (GSLs) (<a href=\"#bib89\">Stahl et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Atwell et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Chan et al., 2010</a>). GSLs constitute a diverse set of plant-made defensive metabolites restricted primarily to the Brassicales that are partitioned into three classes, indolic, aliphatic and aromatic, depending on their amino acid precursor. These N and S containing compounds are stored in the vacuoles of plant cells until they are activated through tissue damage, which can occur through insect feeding and pathogen attack. Natural genetic polymorphisms found among a suite of aliphatic GSL genes in <i>Arabidopsis</i> are responsible for the majority of GSL diversity observed in the leaf tissue (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). These aliphatic GSL genes encode enzymes, transcription factors and activation co-factors that have been identified, cloned and validated in a laboratory setting (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Haughn et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Li and Quiros, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hansen et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hirai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Li et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Neal et al., 2010</a>). Previous studies have uncovered links between GSL variation and ecologically important traits in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, such as resistance to insect/pathogen damage, flowering time, and growth, suggesting that GSLs play an important role in determining plant fitness (<a href=\"#bib66\">Mauricio, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Kliebenstein et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bidart-Bouzat and Kliebenstein, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hansen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Burow et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kerwin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Z\u00fcst et al., 2011</a>). Since the genes responsible for the majority of natural polymorphism in aliphatic GSL have been well characterized in a laboratory setting, the GSL pathway in <i>Arabidopsis</i> provides a good system for understanding the impact that individual genes might have on fitness in the field (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kliebenstein et al., 2001b</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Halkier and Gershenzon, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hansen et al., 2008</a>). In this study, we tested the fitness consequences of aliphatic GSL variation in the field by utilizing a collection of lines that vary at specific GSL genes in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (Col-0), which recreated observed natural variation in the aliphatic GSL pathway found among accessions (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Mauricio, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Kliebenstein et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bidart-Bouzat and Kliebenstein, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hansen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Burow et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kerwin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Z\u00fcst et al., 2011</a>)."

Gene names are listed next to or above the arrows. (<b>A</b>) <b>Regulation of aliphatic GSL biosynthesis</b>. The transcription factors MYB28 and MYB29 control accumulation of aliphatic GLS. A double knockout in these genes results in no aliphatic GLS accumulation, while a single knockout in these genes leads to a 50% reduction in aliphatic GSL (myb28) or a 25% reduction in aliphatic GSL (myb29), compared to WT Col-0. The biosynthetic enzymes MAM1 and AOP2 also influence aliphatic GLS accumulation and a non-functional allele at either locus leads to decreased GSL accumulation. (<b>B</b>) <b>Amino acid chain elongation</b>. During chain elongation, carbons are added to a methionine precursor through a series of reactions producing an elongated amino acid. Variation at the Elong locus controls the number of carbons added to the amino acid precursor and therefore, the length of the GSL side chain, R. A functional allele at this locus, MAM1, leads primarily to accumulation of GSL with four carbon (4C) length side chains, whereas a non-functional allele, gsm1 leads to accumulation of GSL with three carbon (3C) length side chains. The elongated amino acid is subsequently converted into a GLS via the core pathway (not shown). (<b>C</b>) <b>Side chain modification</b>. The GSL compounds produced can then undergo a series of side chain modifications that lead to the suite of diverse GSL compounds found in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Side chain modification is controlled by variation of GSOX1, GSOX3, AOP2, AOP3 and GSOH. GSOX1 &amp; GSOX3 oxygenate a methylthio (MT) to methylsulfinyl (MSO) GSL. AOP2 converts MSO to alkenyl, such as allyl and but-3-enyl. AOP3, on the other hand converts only 3C length MSO to OH-propyl GSL and cannot act on the 4MSO GSL. GSOH oxygenates the 4C but-3-enyl to the OH-alkenyl GSL, OH-but-3-enyl. Since GSOH acts on but-3-enyl GSL, which is a product of AOP2, a functional AOP2 is necessary for GSOH to function and AOP2 is said to be epistatic to GSOH. Col-0 is functional for MAM1 and the GSOX's, null for both AOP2 and AOP3, and functional for GSOH, resulting in accumulation of primarily 4MSO GLS. See <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u201317</a> for images of GSL traces for each GSL genotypes in our mutant laboratory population. (<b>D</b>) <b>GSL Activation</b>. Once produced, GLS are stored in the vacuole in their stable, unreactive form until activation occurs. Upon cellular disruption, such as occurs during pathogen attack, insect herbivory or even wind damage, GLS come into contact with their own plant-made activating enzyme, myrosinase. After production, myrosinase is stored in vacuoles of idioblastic cells called myrosin bodies. Myrosinase activates the GSL compound by cleaving the glucose moiety, yielding an unstable aglycone structure that non-enzymatically rearranges to either nitriles or isothiocyanates, depending on the presence of the co-activators ESM1 and ESP."

Among <i>Arabidopsis</i> accessions, GSL profiles show extensive phenotypic variation across the species geographic distribution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Chan et al., 2010</a>). While previous studies have linked GSL profile variation to insect resistance, as well as correlated the geographic distribution of insect populations with GSL profile-type across Europe, it is still not known to what extent, if at all, individual GSL genes affect fitness in the field (<a href=\"#bib66\">Mauricio, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bidart-Bouzat and Kliebenstein, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Z\u00fcst et al., 2012</a>). To test if standing genetic variation within the aliphatic GSL defensive pathway of <i>A. thaliana</i> impacts fitness in the field, we utilized an existing set of genotypes that recreate natural variation at eight specific GSL loci, with the reference accession, Col-0, as the genetic background. These transgenic lines consisted of loss-of-function T-DNA insertion lines, an EMS mutant and gain-of-function overexpression lines that were originally created to validate individual genes as causal for GSL natural variation (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). For example, the <i>AOP2</i> gene was found to encode an enzyme that converts methylsulfinyl (MSO) GSL into alkenyl GSL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kliebenstein et al., 2001c</a>). Importantly, the <i>AOP2</i> gene is polymorphic among <i>Arabidopsis</i> accessions, with Col-0 accession containing a natural knockout that abolishes its function. Therefore, introducing the functional allele back into Col-0 created a single gene mimic of the natural variation found in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kliebenstein et al., 2001c</a>). The natural variation at the other causal genes has been similarly mimicked as described in the listed citations (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This was facilitated by the fact that all of these genes contain natural presence/absence polymorphisms (citations in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

However, these GSL genotypes have not previously been tested in the field to determine if they produce the same GSL profiles as when grown in the laboratory. We particularly wanted to assess if variation at individual aliphatic GSL genes has the same impact on GSL profile in the field as predicted from published lab experiments when the plants are grown in different complex environments, and therefore measured GSL on all the plants grown in each of our three field trials. A mixed model analysis of field GSL revealed that the majority of variation in GSL profiles in the field was controlled by the GSL genotypes that we generated (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Importantly, the majority of the GSL genotypes produced the expected GSL profiles in the field, consistent with the lab studies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1\u201317</a>). To quantify the similarity in profiles between field and lab grown samples, we conducted a PCA analysis using the GSL profiles of these genotypes grown in a growth chamber. The first four vectors from our PCA were able to explain &gt;99% of the variation in GSL profile. We utilized the loadings from the chamber PCA to estimate PCA scores of the first four vectors using the chamber GSL and field GSL. The scores for the field grown genotypes were highly correlated with the lab grown genotypes, showing that the GSL genetic variation leads to highly similar field and lab profiles (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>)."

This creates a set of mathematical descriptors of the chemotype variation across the 17 genotypes. The first three eigenvectors were used to generate scores from the lsmeans of the glucosinolates across the 17 glucosinolate genotypes independently for the chamber and three different field environments values. These scores were then correlated to test if the GSL profiles were similar or not across the environments. The R of the correlation to the Chamber scores for the 17 genotypes for each of the three PCA vectors are shown in conjunction with the p value as determined by Pearson correlation. To the right of each PCA vector label is shown the fraction of total variance approximated by the given vector. In total, the four vectors describe &gt;99% of the GSL profile variance."

                                "text": "In addition to the quantitative comparison of profiles, we also investigated the specificity of each locus in producing particular GSL structures to ensure that its field behavior mimicked the lab behavior. We found that, for the most part, each GSL gene produced the expected GSL phenotype in the field. For example, all lines harboring a functional <i>AOP2</i> gene produce alkenyl GSL (e.g., but-3-enyl GSL) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 4</a>). Additionally, the functional/non-functional allelic state at the <i>MAM1</i> locus was always predictive of the chain-length of the GSL in the field as predicted from lab experiments. The lines with a functional <i>MAM1</i>, like Col-0, produced more 4C GSL than 3C GSL, while genotypes with a non-functional <i>MAM1</i> always produced more 3C GSL than 4C GSL (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Haughn et al., 1991</a>). A functional copy of <i>GSOH</i>, the gene encoding the enzyme to create 2-OH-but-3-enyl, always leads to the production of 2-OH-but-3-enyl GSL from but-3-enyl GSL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hansen et al., 2008</a>). In addition to the biosynthetic genes, the <i>MYB</i> genes, which encode transcription factors that control accumulation of aliphatic GSLs, showed similar field phenotypes as were found in the lab (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hirai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">S\u00f8nderby et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib88\">2010</a>). Specifically, a non-functional <i>MYB28</i> leads to an almost complete reduction in long chain (8C) GSL and a 60% reduction in short chain (3C and 4C) GSL (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hirai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">S\u00f8nderby et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib88\">2010</a>). A non-functional <i>MYB29</i> leads to a 40% reduction in short chain GSL with no significant reduction in long chain GSL (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hirai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">S\u00f8nderby et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib88\">2010</a>). A double mutant in <i>MYB28</i> and <i>MYB29</i> lead to an almost complete loss of all aliphatic GSLs, as expected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hirai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">S\u00f8nderby et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib88\">2010</a>). The only genes for which the field and laboratory GSL profile data differ are <i>GSOX1</i> and <i>GSOX3</i>, which are two tightly linked genes at the GSOX locus that also contains two additional genes, <i>GSOX2</i> and <i>GSOX4</i>. In the lab, <i>gsox1</i> and <i>gsox3</i> mutants accumulate higher levels of methylthio (MT) GSL than does Col-0, due to reduced expression of a flavin-monooxygenase that converts the MT to MSO GSL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hansen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Li et al., 2008</a>). In the field there was no measureable accumulation of MT GSL in any line, likely due to the redundant function of the <i>GSOX2</i> and <i>GSOX4</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kerwin et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Li et al., 2008</a>). Thus, the field results show that the laboratory work on GSL genotypes and their associated GSL profiles are translatable and predictive of the GSL profiles found in naturally fluctuating environments."

For example, genotypes with a <i>myb28/myb29</i> double knockout accumulated virtually no GSL in all three environments.

To assess if changes in environment impact herbivory levels, we measured leaf damage on a scale from 0\u201310 in all three field trials, with and without a pesticide treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). A mixed model analysis showed that leaf damage significantly varied across the three environments but that the pesticide application did not significantly alter leaf damage in the field (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). The UWY2012 field trial (mean = 2.610) had significantly higher levels of leaf damage than both UWY2011 (mean = 1.17, p value &lt;1e-04) and UCD2012 (mean = 1.50, p value &lt;1e-04), though UCD2012 and UWY2011 environments did not differ significantly for leaf damage (p value = 0.44). Field plots were treated with pesticides once every 2 weeks, which did not entirely eliminate leaf damage on the treated individuals. A more aggressive pesticide treatment regime would have been necessary to abolish leaf damage in the treated group. In addition, the levels of leaf damage measured in our study are low relative to other field studies in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bidart-Bouzat and Kliebenstein, 2008</a>). The field site was located adjacent to other experimental field sites and greenhouses that also treated for pests, which may or may not have had an impact on the relative levels and/or pesticide resistance of herbivores in the vicinity. This combination of low overall leaf damage levels and the fact that the pesticide treatment did not eliminate leaf damage in the treated group is likely the cause for this lack of a treatment effect. However, there is a significant environment effect for leaf damage, indicating that this trait varied across the three field trials. In fact, we see no significant correlation of leaf damage across the three environments (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). This suggests the three environments experienced differing herbivory pressures. Since we did not measure herbivore levels, we cannot determine whether the differences in leaf damage are the direct result of differences in insect populations. It is interesting to note that the UWY field site showed both the highest and lowest leaf damage levels, demonstrating that there can be potentially large temporal fluctuations in herbivory at a single location (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Table 3\u2014source data 2</a>)."

Within a field environment, levels of leaf damage significantly varied across GSL genotypes, in agreement with the role of GSL in deterring herbivory (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). However, the extent of leaf damage incurred upon different GSL genotypes in the field fluctuated among environments, such that no particular GSL genotype showed a consistent maximal or minimal level of leaf damage across the three field trials (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). For example, the <i>myb28/AOP2</i> and <i>AOP2</i> genotypes had similar herbivory in UCD2012 (mean = 1.30 and 1.95, respectively) and UWY2011 (mean = 1.29 and 0.80, respectively) but strongly diverged in UWY2012 (mean = 1.45 and 5.64, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). It has been shown, in a laboratory setting that the extent to which GSL profile provides resistance varies across different herbivore species (<a href=\"#bib53\">Kroymann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Pfalz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hansen et al., 2008</a>). In addition, GSL have been shown to provide resistance to fungi, bacteria and nematodes, which may have also been present and variable between our environments (<a href=\"#bib64\">Manici et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Tierens et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aires et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Witzel et al., 2013</a>). It is likely that the composition of the herbivore communities differed between the two field sites. Though we did not conduct a complete survey of the herbivores present at UWY and UCD, we did observe differences in leaf damage patterns between the two locations, suggesting that there would be differences in the composition of herbivores species present. Together, these results show that GSL variation controls differential leaf damage in each field trial but the specific directions of effect for individual GSL genotypes is subject to environmental conditions, such as the composition of herbivores, which can vary temporally and spatially."

To test if the GSL genotypes alter plant fitness in the three environments, we measured fecundity of each individual grown in the field. Plants were harvested from the field at maturity and the numbers of fruits, flowers and buds per plant were counted in the laboratory to yield total fruit count (TFC). TFC has previously been shown to be a good proxy for fecundity in <i>Arabidopsis</i> where total number of seeds per plant is highly correlated with total number of siliques (i.e., fruits) (<a href=\"#bib103\">Wolf et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Kliebenstein et al., 2001c</a>). Among the GSL genotypes we observed variation in silique length. <i>Arabidopsis</i> siliques contain two rows of seeds in a linear conformation, so that silique length strongly correlates with seed number at maturity, assuming uniform seed size. Therefore variation in silique length or seed size could affect our fecundity estimates. Silique length and seed size were measured from digital images of GSL genotypes harvested from the field and seed size showed no significant variation (data not shown). However, there was significant variation in silique length across GSL genotypes as well as a significant genotype by environment interaction (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Table 3\u2014source data 1</a>). We concluded that the significant differences in silique lengths are likely reflective of fecundity and adjusted our fitness measurements using this information. Estimates of absolute fitness were therefore obtained for each individual as TFC multiplied by silique length both including and excluding individuals that did not survive to harvest. Survivorship was included in fitness estimates to avoid obtaining artificially inflated fitness estimates from GSL genotypes with higher death rates that would result from removing individuals that do not survive to fruiting and have a fitness of zero."

Environment did not show a significant main effect on either measure of absolute fitness, suggesting that the population mean for absolute fitness may have been comparable across the environments and instead it is the fitness of GSL genotypes relative to each other within an environment that varies.

Absolute fitness varied greatly between the highest and lowest ranked GSL genotypes within each of the environments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>). In addition, the performance of different GSL genotypes relative to each other varied across environments, so that no GSL genotype outperformed all the others in all three environments. For example, <i>myb28/AOP2</i> shows the greatest fitness in the UCD2012 environment and the lowest fitness in UWY2012. In contrast, <i>myb28/gsoh</i> shows an opposite pattern while other genotypes showing a diversity of other patterns (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This fluctuation in rank of GSL genotypes across environments can also be observed if we look at fluctuations of TFC with and without survivorship across the three environments, though the patterns for specific GSL genotypes vary across the different fitness measures (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, it appears that the significant interaction of GSL genotype by environment controlling fitness is caused by fluctuations in the fitness rank of different genotypes across environments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Therefore, in addition to absolute fitness, we also analyzed the effect of the GSL genotype on relative fitness in the field, both with and without survivorship. We calculated relative fitness of each GSL genotype within each environment as absolute fitness divided the population mean within that environment. Even more strongly than with our absolute fitness measurements, we found that GSL genotype and the interaction between GSL genotype and environment both had a significant impact on relative fitness in the field both including and excluding survivorship (<a href=\"#tbl6\">Table 6</a>). For example, myb28 has a higher than average relative fitness in UWY2011 but shows an average and slightly lower than average relative fitness in UWY2012 and UCD2012, respectively (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). In other cases, relative fitness of a GSL genotype is similar among the UWY field trials but differs in the UCD field trial. Two examples, with opposite patterns are <i>myb28/AOP2</i>, that has low relative fitness in both UWY field trials but higher relative fitness in UCD and gsm1, that has high relative fitness in both UWY field trials but lower relative fitness in UCD. This indicates that temporal and spatial fluctuations in fitness can both occur and are dependent on genotypic differences."

In a laboratory setting, GSL genes have been observed to pleiotropically alter these traits (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kerwin et al., 2011</a>). In the field, both of these phenotypes were significantly affected by the GSL genetic variation in our synthetic population, indicating that aliphatic GSL genes can have pleiotropic impacts beyond the aliphatic GSL pathway that can be observed in natural settings (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Table 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Therefore, there is the possibility that either of these phenotypes might be driving the observed variation in fitness of GSL genotypes across these environments. To test this, we conducted genetic correlations using the genotypic means for absolute fitness, flowering time and total indole GSL within each environment (<a href=\"#tbl7\">Table 7</a>). We did not observe a significant correlation between absolute fitness and our pleiotriopic traits, using either parametric or non-parametric approaches, in any of our three environments (<a href=\"#tbl7\">Table 7</a>).

Using the validated GSL phenotype caused by genetic variation at the eight causal genes for the aliphatic GSL pathway, we assigned a GSL haplotype to each <i>Arabidopsis</i> accession, given its GSL profile (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Using the available GSL profile information, the underlying allelic state at each of the eight genes assigned functional or non-functional, based on presence or absence of different GSL structures as well as the relative abundances of different structures, that is, based on the GSL profile of the accession. This identified 18 distinct aliphatic GSL haplotypes among the set of 144 natural <i>Arabidopsis</i> accessions, observed at different frequencies (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 9\u2014source data 1</a>). Using the observed single locus allelic frequencies, we calculated the expected GSL haplotype frequencies for each of the 18 multi-locus genotypes (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 9\u2014source data 1</a>). These expected frequencies for the GSL genotypes represent theoretical frequencies that would be expected if no selection gradient acted upon GSL variation and no genetic drift, migration or other non-selective effect upon population structure biased the allele distribution. Comparing the population of observed vs expected frequencies was highly non-random (p &lt; 0.001) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 9\u2014source data 1</a>). Further, specific multi-locus GSL genotypes occurred significantly more or less often than expected (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 9\u2014source data 1</a>). Thus, the non-random variation of GSL haplotypes within the <i>Arabidopsis</i> accessions supports the observations from the empirical field trials. It is similarly possible that this observed non-random variation is caused by non-selective processes such as migration, population structure and/or local bottleneck. Significant future efforts will be required to test the extent to which this non-random variation is caused by neutral demographic processes vs potential fluctuating selection."

A clear example of this is aliphatic GSL accumulation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, which is highly polygenic and environmentally dependent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 4, 5</a>). However, it has been complicated to validate that specific polymorphic loci within a pathway are the actual causative basis of any changes in fitness due to the use of polygenic populations (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lande and Arnold, 1983</a>). In this study, using a single gene manipulation approach that has allowed us, over the past decade, to recreate natural allelic diversity in the aliphatic GSL pathway, we have shown that GSL genetic variation at numerous loci directly impacts <i>Arabidopsis</i> fitness in the field (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Because we have only manipulated the GSL genes within an otherwise isogenic background, we can directly conclude that it is these specific genes and their GSL phenotypes that are determining the differences in fitness in the field. Further experiments will optimally generate the full 256-line matrix containing all combinations of alleles between all loci to fully interrogate the effects of all loci in all possible backgrounds. We should also note that even with all of our efforts to clean up the respective backgrounds and validate that the mutant phenotypes are similar to the segregating natural genotypes, it remains possible that some of the observed effects are caused by unexpected changes in the lines."

                        "text": "More difficult however is to ascribe the specific selective forces acting on this GSL variation to produce a fitness effect. GSL are known plant defensive compounds and variation in GSL genotype was shown to significantly impact GSL profiles, leaf damage and fitness in the field (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). While GSL variation did alter measured leaf damage in the field, the patterns did not fully reflect the relative fitness spectrum of these same genotypes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6\u20138</a>). One possibility is that our experiment, even with 20 blocks (10 control/10 pesticide treated) per field trial, was still insufficient to identify the underlying link, suggesting the need for larger experiments. Another possibility is that there were different herbivore populations between these environments, which agrees with the observation that there was no genetic correlation of herbivore resistance across the three field trials (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). The fact that different GSLs defend against different herbivores would complicate finding the specific link between GSL loci and a population of herbivores (<a href=\"#bib53\">Kroymann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Falk and Gershenzon, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Pfalz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hansen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Falk et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, our herbivory measures are limited to foliar damage, which obfuscates any potential interactions between GSL genotype and root pathogens. Supporting this idea, previous studies have found that GSL can influence a number of root pathogens and commensal microbes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bending and Lincoln, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">van Dam et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bressan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Millet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Witzel et al., 2013</a>).

We showed that the GSL genes have pleiotropic effects on development such as flowering time that while having no link to fitness in our experiments could impact fitness in other environments. Similarly, previous work has shown that individual GSL structures directly modulate stomatal closure in response to wounding (<a href=\"#bib104\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, analysis of natural variation and validation lines showed that GSL structure and amount can influence the circadian clock and flowering time (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kerwin et al., 2011</a>). Other experiments have also identified a potential for regulatory roles with indole GLS (<a href=\"#bib20\">Clay et al., 2009</a>). Thus, these are not indirect pleiotropies but direct regulatory links whereby GSLs may influence the plants abiotic responses potentially to alter the biotic interactions. Thus, it is possible that the observed GSL to fitness links are resulting from a complex web of biotic and abiotic effects. Identifying the specific selective agents affected by GSL variation will require the development of techniques for rapid and systematic identification of all foliar and root herbivores and microbes from field samples as well as a complete physiological and developmental analysis of the plant within the field. This is especially critical as the specific agents of selection may be highly variable across environments."

This suggests that the GSL defense pathway might be a system in which genetic variation could be stabilized by fluctuating selection across the environments. Fully exploring this hypothesis will require extensive assessment of genetic variation at the polymorphic GSL loci within natural populations and more extensive field trials of this synthetic population that recreates natural diversity at these same loci."

This would require either spatial variation in fitness and/or variation within a seed bank to provide extra drive for the system (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dempster, 1955</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Turelli et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Turelli and Barton, 2004</a>).

Further, there is extensive allelic variation within small local regions that contain different habitats, that would likely experience different insect pressures, providing the potential for spatial variation in fitness (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bomblies et al., 2010</a>). Thus, both conditions necessary for fluctuating selection to maintain diversity in <i>Arabidopsis</i> exist, but we do not yet know enough about the extent of the seed bank or spatial variation in selection within <i>Arabidopsis</i> to fully model the system. This shows that a greater understanding of life history traits, seed bank history and migration rates in natural populations of <i>Arabidopsis</i> is necessary to determine if fluctuating selection is contributing to the maintenance of variation in this species."

These fitness effects were not driven by pleiotropic phenotypes like flowering, but the specific selective pressures driving these fitness differences remain to be identified. Identifying these pressures will require vastly larger surveys of natural populations and long-term field trials. Using the empirical values for fitness, we could show that the GSL system within these environments fits models where fluctuating selection can maintain standing polygenic variation. Further trials are required to test if this is more broadly applicable across a broader range of environments. This would require more field trials using our synthetic population to provide the capacity to empirically evaluate models of maintenance of standing variation and its influence on adaptation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gillespie and Turelli, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Orr, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Agrawal, 2001</a>).

The first field trial was performed at the University of Wyoming (UWY) in Laramie, WY during Summer 2011, the second at UC Davis in Davis, CA Spring 2012, and the third at UWY during Summer 2012. Seeds were sown into flats with 2 inch 50-celled inserts using Sunshine #5 (Sungro, Agawam, MA) potting soil containing slow release fertilizer and stratified at 4\u00b0C for 4 days before being transferred into the greenhouse at either the University of Wyoming in Laramie (UWY) or the University of California at Davis (UCD) to facilitate germination synchrony. In the UWY greenhouse, plants received 15 hr light/9 hr dark natural phototoperiod with temperatures fluctuating diurnally from 10\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C. In the UCD greenhouse, plants received 14 hr light/10 hr dark natural photoperiod with temperatures fluctuating from 15\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C. Further, starting all the plants in the greenhouse minimizes variation in the initial seedling conditions. After germination, seedlings were thinned to one per pot and GSL genotypes were randomly organized into 40 blocks per field trial, for a total of 120 blocks total and also 120 GSL genotype replicates total. Individuals were transplanted from the greenhouse into the field 2 weeks post germination. A single plant of each genotype was present in each block in all three environments and blocks were arranged into four rows of ten blocks each (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Each row of 10 blocks is referred to as a plot, so that there were four plots per field trial and 12 plots total. Within each plot is nested a treatment by environment combination. Every 14 days, two plots (20 blocks total) per environment were treated with pesticides to decrease leaf damage due to herbivory. At UWY, plants were sprayed with the insecticide Sevin (GardenTech, Palatine, IL) to repel flea beetles. At UCD, plants were treated with Marathon 1% granular (OHP, Mainland, PA) and Lily Miller Slug, Snail &amp; Insect Killer Bait (Lily Miller Brands, Walnut Creek, CA). The plants were allowed to grow in the field for 4 weeks before being harvested. At harvest, the aerial portion of each plant was collected from the field, placed into a quart sized freezer bag and transferred into 4\u00b0C for temporary storage. After the harvest completion, the UCD field plants were immediately placed into \u221280\u00b0C for storage. The UWY field plants were shipped to UC Davis overnight on dry ice and then placed in \u221280\u00b0C for storage."

At approximately 4 weeks of age, a single, fully expanded, green leaf was collected from each plant. In order to measure leaf area of each sample, leaves from twelve plants at a time were placed on a white sheet of paper with a grid overlay. A ruler was placed on the sheet of paper below the leaves and digitally imaged using a Nikon D3100 (Tokyo, Japan). The photographed leaves were then placed directly into 96 deep well plates containing 400 \u03bcl 90% methanol and stored in the freezer until extraction. For the UWY field trial, the leaves were stored at \u221220\u00b0C for 3\u20134 weeks and shipped overnight to Davis, CA on dry ice. For the Davis field trial, all plates were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until extraction. After harvest, desulfoglucosinolates were extracted from all samples using a high-throughput protocol briefly described below (<a href=\"#bib50\">Kliebenstein et al., 2001a</a>). One gram of Sephadex DEAE A-25 (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to each well of a 96 well filter plate using a column loader. To hydrate the Sephadex, 300 \u03bcl of H<sub>2</sub>O was transferred to each well using a multichannel pipet and allowed to incubate at room temp 1 hr. Excess H<sub>2</sub>O was removed from the Sephadex by placing filter plate on top of a 96 deep well discard plate (used to catch the flow through) and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 2 min. To homogenize the samples, 96 deep well plates containing a single <i>A. thaliana</i> leaf, two 2.3 mm ball bearings and 400 \u03bcl of 90% methanol in each well were shaken in a Harbil 5-Gallon Mixer (Fluid Management Co., Wheeling, IL) for 3\u20135 min. Plates were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min. To bind GSL to Sephadex, 150 \u03bcl of supernatant from each well (containing the extracted organic compounds) was transferred to the corresponding well of the 96 well filter plate containing hydrated Sephadex and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 3 min on top of the 96 deep well discard plate. To wash away all the non-binding organic compounds from the Sephadex, 150 \u03bcl of 90% methanol was added to each well and the plate was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 3 min. To remove excess methanol, two wash steps were conducted by adding 150 \u03bcl of H<sub>2</sub>O to the plate followed by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 3 min. To release the GSL from the Sephadex, 10 \u03bcl of Sulfatase (Sigma\u2013Alrich) and 100 \u03bcl of water were added to each well of the 96 well filter plate then incubated overnight in the dark. The desulfoglucosinolates were then eluted into a 96 well round bottom plate via centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 3 min. For each GSL sample, 50 \u03bcl of the 110 \u03bcl of extract was injected on an Agilent 1100 HPLC (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) using a Lichrocart 250\u20134 RP18e column (Hewlett\u2013Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Individual GSL compounds were detected at 229 nm and separated utilizing the following program with an aqueous acetonitrile gradient: a 6-min gradient from 1.5% to 5.0% (vol/vol) acetonitrile, followed by a 2-min gradient from 5% to 7% (vol/vol) acetonitrile, a 7-min gradient from 7% to 25% (vol/vol) acetonitrile, a 2-min gradient from 25% to 92% (vol/vol) acetonitrile, 6 min at 92% (vol/vol) acetonitrile, a 1-min gradient from 92% to 1.5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile, and a final 5 min at 1.5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile (<a href=\"#bib50\">Kliebenstein et al., 2001a</a>). For each peak, the GSL structure was determined by comparing the retention time and UV absorption spectrum with known standards. The integral under each peak was automatically calculated and this value in mili-absorption units was converted to picamoles/mm<sup>2</sup> tissue using response factor slopes determined from purified standards and area of leaf tissue used per sample as measured by ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib50\">Kliebenstein et al., 2001a</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Reichelt et al., 2002</a>)."

Silique length was measured in ImageJ from digital images of harvested field plants taken using a Nikon D3100 as follows: each plant was placed flat on a white sheet of paper next to a ruler and pictures were taken using auto focus. After setting the scale in ImageJ using the ruler placed in each image, the segmented line tool was used to draw a line from the pedicle to the tip of the silique. For each plant, eight siliques were measured at random and these values were averaged to get a value for each plant. Survival was scored on a binary (0\u20131) scale. Plants that germinated, were transplanted into the field and survived to harvest were given a survival score of 1 and plants that germinated and were transplanted but did not survive to harvest were given a score of 0. Individuals that did not germinate or did not survive to transplantation were given an NA. Relative fitness was calculated for each GSL genotype within each environment relative to Col-0. To do this, average absolute fitness of a GSL genotype was divided by the average absolute fitness of Col-0 within a environment. Col-0 was chosen as the reference genotype given that it is the background genotype."

These mutants were designed such that in each mutant line distinct branches of the glucosinolate pathway were removed selectively and these predicted phenotypes were validated. Then they composed variable populations by transplanting these mutants together at several field sites during several years to monitor several fitness proxies. The manuscript revolves around the question to which extent specific genes can affect fitness under different environmental conditions differently. The value of this work is that it provides a comprehensive assessment on known genes and fluctuating patterns of herbivory and fitness in nature. Hence, Kerwin and colleagues argue that that fluctuating selection may maintain polymorphisms in glucosinolate biosynthesis genes in natural populations."

During our discussion we consulted Michael Turelli directly and together we reached the following conclusion: although these data certainly warrant a discussion on fluctuating selection to play a role here, there is no simple formula to provide the appropriate polymorphism condition in this case, to the best of our knowledge. The detailed comments of Turelli are below and can form an excellent basis for a revised discussion on known genes and fluctuations in herbivory and fitness in nature (we were missing <a href=\"#bib80\">Prasad et al., 2012</a>, 337:1081 in Science, which during the discussion came up as one of the few, if not only, other examples). Furthermore we suggest you make an estimate of the genetic correlation between environments for levels of herbivore resistance among these genotypes. This will be informative, and should not be difficult to calculate from the existing data and will bring depth into the Discussion. Please take this discussion into account that glucosinolates can have effect on fitness also via other effects than herbivore damage alone."

If <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> were <i>completely</i> selfing, which I believe is reasonable as a first approximation, populations would be effectively composed of competing clonal genotypes (the referees mention here that <i>Arabidopsis</i> is less clonal than indicated by Turelli, otherwise genome-wide association studies would be impossible). In this case, the distinction between variants at one locus vs multiple loci is irrelevant, as is the distinction between diploidy and haploidy. Hence, the diploid-random-mating conditions provided by <a href=\"#bib95\">Turelli and Barton (2004)</a> are irrelevant to the maintenance of variation. In general, temporal fluctuations alone <i>cannot</i> maintain variation for a haploid, the genotype with the highest geometric mean fitness will prevail (this idea goes back to <a href=\"#bib24\">Dempster 1955</a>, cited in <a href=\"#bib97\">Turelli et al. 2001</a>, Evolution 55:1283-1298, which explicitly deals with the maintenance of a famous flower-color polymorphism). For such populations, one must invoke either spatially varying fitness or temporal variation with a seed bank. The exact conditions for the maintenance of variation will depend on the nature of gene flow between patches with alternative selection regimes and the extent to which the seed bank creates overlapping generations. These issues are discussed by <a href=\"#bib97\">Turelli et al. (2001)</a>."

However, showing that different genotypes are favored under different conditions does indeed suggest that fluctuating selection (in time and/or space) may contribute to the maintenance of this polymorphism. The exact mathematical conditions relevant to this system have probably not been worked out. However, assuming near-complete selfing, maintenance of variation will require overlapping generations via a seed bank (I'm not sure if this is relevant to <i>A. thaliana</i>) and/or spatial variation with gene flow. The exact conditions will be subtle and depend on biological details that are surely not known.\u201d"

The authors should not forget that their findings are not expected and may be driven by processes that were not supposed to play a role. What about insertion effects? Inserted transgenes can disrupt other genes and may result in fitness effects that are unrelated to GLS function. EMS lines initially contain thousands of mutations. They are generally removed by multiple generation of backcrossing to the wild type. Crossing adds some additional backcrossing, is it possible that lines differ in the number of linked mutations? Finally, transgenes are not always stably expressed and could be silenced in one or the other generation, especially if several tDNA insertion lines are coupled. Such problems are well known to (good) molecular biologists but often overseen by ecologists. I believe it is important to critically assess the possibility that the manipulated lines may not be doing exactly what they are supposed to do."

Further, in reply to Reviewer 2, we have noted that our previous work has shown that unexpected links to non-GSL phenotypes, such as flowering time, have been validated both with the transgenic and natural populations i.e. we could map circadian timing variation to GSL loci in an <i>Arabidopsis</i> RIL populations and then show the effect using the transgenic validation lines. This was with both enzymatic loci and transcription factor loci showing that this is not a second site effect, but instead a link from GSL to the clock and flowering. We wish we could provide more mechanistic insight into these non-traditional roles of GSLs but these experiments are still underway. We have included a new section showing that these pleiotropic effects on flowering and indole glucosinolate are not correlated with fitness showing that the GSL to fitness link is not an artifact of some secondary indirect random pleiotropy as best we can measure."
