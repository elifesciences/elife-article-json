While numerous studies have examined genes underlying neoblast pluripotency, molecular pathways driving postmitotic fates remain poorly defined. Here we used transcriptional profiling of irradiation-sensitive and -insensitive cell populations and RNA interference (RNAi) functional screening to uncover markers and regulators of postmitotic progeny. We identified 32 new markers distinguishing two main epithelial progenitor populations, and a planarian homolog to the MEX3 RNA-binding protein (<i>Smed-mex3-1</i>) as a key regulator of lineage progression. <i>mex3-1</i> was required for generating differentiated cells of multiple lineages, while restricting the size of the stem cell compartment. We also demonstrated the utility of using <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> animals to identify additional progenitor markers. These results identified <i>mex3-1</i> as a cell fate regulator, broadly required for differentiation, and suggest that <i>mex3-1</i> helps mediate the balance between ASC self-renewal and commitment."
