Being an open-access journal means that anyone (with an Internet connection) can freely read articles published in eLife.

A plant biologist with decades of experience in research, for example, is unlikely to also be an expert in neuroscience (and vice versa). By explaining the findings of a paper in plain language, we hope that digests will help other scientists to identify new connections between different scientific disciplines."

By working on an eLife digest, the authors of the original research article gain skills and experience that can be applied to other situations."

Every digest is edited carefully and sent to the authors of the research paper for checking before it is published; we work closely with the authors to ensure that each digest is a clear and accurate explanation of the main findings of their paper."

Instead the challenge is to explain the same concepts and findings as the paper but in language that most people would understand, and without assuming that the reader has any previous specialist knowledge."

However, this does not mean that digests should be viewed as exercises in creative writing either: flowery language and convoluted analogies can be just as difficult to follow as text laden with scientific jargon. Instead, a good eLife digest is clear, concise and complete; it states the facts without resorting to exaggeration or hype."

We are confident that you can write a digest for any research paper, including papers that would not typically attract the attention of the wider media. Sure, we have written digests about the discovery of <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09560\"><i>Homo naledi</i></a> and how <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00590\">one in four shark species are on the brink of extinction</a>. But we have also tackled topics like how <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04785\">scuttle flies develop as embryos</a>, how <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19271\">proteins form changing patterns inside artificial chambers</a>, and how <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16616\">sodium and potassium ions are pumped across cell membranes</a>. We feel that digests are especially valuable in such papers because they are unlikely to be highlighted in a press release or attract coverage in the media."

Initially, the digests were written using the accepted manuscript and authors\u2019 cover letter as the primary sources of information. However, reading this material, getting familiar with the background and then distilling it down to the key findings took a lot of time. In 2015, we started to think about how we could involve the authors of the paper \u2013 who already knew all of these details \u2013 earlier in the process. From May to July 2015, we ran a pilot study with 100 authors who had recently been invited to submit a revised manuscript. We asked these authors about the key points that should be covered in the digest, and gave some brief guidelines on how we would like them to answer our questions."

Authors also made fewer edits than before when checking their digests, and now we ask authors to answer four questions to help us write their digest.

This was not unexpected because we appreciate that being immersed in their research can make it harder for authors to write for people who do not know what they know, the so-called curse of knowledge. Nevertheless, giving clear instructions and breaking down the task by asking authors a few questions has, in our experience, been a good way to tap into their expert knowledge and write the digest more quickly."

By 2016, however, it was clear that writing a digest cannot be rushed. As the number of papers accepted each month continued to climb, we made the difficult decision to stop publishing a digest for every research article. Instead, we now identify a selection of about 60 papers each month for eLife digests. These are selected based on a range of criteria: first and foremost, we want to offer digests to those authors who show the most willing to get involved early on in the process. Secondly, we rely on recommendations from eLife\u2019s Board of Reviewing Editors to find those papers that are the most significant within their fields. Lastly, we select other papers from areas that most interest our readers, and especially those papers that attempt to bridge different disciplines."
