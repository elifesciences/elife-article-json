At first, the sister chromosomes are held together near a region called the centromere, which is important because the microtubules that pull the sister chromosomes apart attach themselves to the centromere. In many cases, the centromere is a small region near the middle of the chromosomes, which produces a classic X shape. However, in some organisms centromeres span the entire length of the chromosomes. There are at least 13 plant and animal lineages with such holocentromeres."

These experiments showed that the holocentromere in <i>C. elegans</i> is actually made of about 700 individual centromeric sites distributed along the length of the chromosomes. Each of these sites contains just one nucleosome that contains cenH3, and these sites are likely to be the sites that microtubules attach to during cell division. Surprisingly, the same sites can also act as so-called \u2018HOT\u2013sites\u2019: these sites are bound by many proteins that are involved in regulating the process by which genes are expressed as proteins, which suggests a link between centromeres and these regulatory proteins."

Centromeres are universally marked by the variant histone cenH3 (also called CENP-A in many organisms) that replaces canonical histone H3 in centromeric nucleosomes, and most commonly localize to a single position along the chromosome (<a href=\"#bib40\">Malik and Henikoff, 2009</a>). However, the DNA on which centromeric nucleosomes assemble is not conserved and varies greatly in size and composition. It ranges from genetically defined point centromeres that assemble a single cenH3-containing nucleosome to epigenetically defined regional centromeres of several kb or Mb of tandemly repeated DNA to holocentromeres that extend along the length of entire chromosomes. With the exception of budding yeast point centromeres, where there is a 1:1 relationship between a single cenH3 nucleosome and the functional centromere, the precise organization of centromeric chromatin has remained elusive. One of the main issues standing in the way of uncovering the distribution of centromeric nucleosomes is the fact that most regional centromeres are localized to homogeneous tandemly repetitive regions of the genome, making it difficult to map individual nucleosomes. <i>C. elegans</i> is amenable to address this question because the genome is repeat-poor, making it possible to precisely map centromeric regions."

Two models have been put forward for how holocentric chromosomes might be organized (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schrader, 1947</a>).

These findings thus seemingly supported the diffuse centromere model. However, mitotic microtubules must attach to discrete sites for chromosome segregation, and the number of microtubules attached during <i>C. elegans</i> mitosis has been estimated to about 100 for all six chromosomes combined (<a href=\"#bib51\">O\u2019Toole et al., 2003</a>).

Depletion of the machinery needed for incorporation of cenH3 nucleosomes resulted in reduced occupancy of cenH3 at these sites. As an independent indicator of centromeric localization, we also profiled the inner kinetochore protein CENP-C (also called HCP-4 in <i>C. elegans</i>). We found that cenH3 sites coincide with high CENP-C signal, indicating that they serve as attachment sites for the kinetochore, consistent with a polycentric organization of the chromosome. Individual sites resemble budding yeast point centromeres and coincide with transcription factor hotspots, which become occupied by transcription factors when cenH3 is lost, providing a clue as to how kinetochore sites might be selected and maintained."

CenH3 is enriched towards the arms relative to the centers of the autosomes, while the distribution on the X chromosome is relatively even (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i>, chromosome arms tend to be enriched for repeats and are associated with marks of heterochromatin (<a href=\"#bib63\">The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, the distribution of cenH3 is positively correlated with the distribution of trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3), a mark of transcriptionally silent regions, in both our ChIP-seq and the previously published ChIP\u2013chip data (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, left panels. r = 0.44, p&lt;2.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup> for correlation with cenH3 X-Chip and r = 0.31, p&lt;2.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup> for correlation with N-ChIP) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gu and Fire, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2011</a>).

We therefore wondered if the enrichment of cenH3 is associated with lower nucleosome turnover. The replication-independent variant histone H3.3 is incorporated into chromatin when nucleosomes are replaced and serves as a measure of replication-independent nucleosome turnover (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mito et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Goldberg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ooi et al., 2010</a>). Consistent with the hypothesis that cenH3 is associated with lower nucleosome turnover, we found that the distributions of H3.3 and cenH3 are negatively correlated in both our ChIP-seq and the previously published ChIP\u2013chip data (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, center panels. r = \u22120.65, p&lt;2.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup> for correlation with cenH3 X-Chip and r = \u22120.21, p&lt;2.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup> for correlation with N-ChIP). Replication-independent nucleosome turnover is mainly driven by transcription (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deal et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Teves and Henikoff, 2011</a>), consistent with the previously described anti-correlation between cenH3 and RNA polymerase II (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gassmann et al., 2012</a>)."

Despite the use of a different methodology (low-salt native chromatin preparation and MNase digestion instead of formaldehyde fixation and sonication, a different antibody and ChIP-seq instead of ChIP\u2013chip), our data showed a very similar domain pattern (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, second track, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, right panel. Correlation with cenH3 X-ChIP r = 0.67, p&lt;2.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>). The previously published data (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gassmann et al., 2012</a>) pointed to an anti-correlation of cenH3 occupancy with transcription in the germline and in the early embryo. Because there is little RNA Polymerase II activity in the early embryo, and transcriptional profiles are not directly transmitted during the maternal\u2013zygotic transition, the authors proposed that it is the memory of germline transcription transmitted to the embryo that excludes cenH3 incorporation. We found that the domains were both negatively correlated with previously published H3.3 data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, third track) and positively correlated with previously published H3K9me3 patterns (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, fourth track) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ooi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). H3.3 is abundantly incorporated into chromatin in the germline and throughout early embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ooi et al., 2010</a>), whereas H3K9me3 is associated with transcriptionally silent chromatin where nucleosome turnover and H3.3 incorporation are low (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mito et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gu and Fire, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ooi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). This suggests that it is nucleosome turnover that excludes the deposition of cenH3 and shapes the domain-like distribution of cenH3 across the genome, which can happen even in absence of transcription in the early embryo."

The large-scale correspondence of our native ChIP-seq data to the previously published crosslinked ChIP\u2013chip data provides independent confirmation of this interpretation. However, we wondered whether there might also be preferred sites of centromeric nucleosome positioning within the cenH3 domains of <i>C. elegans</i>, as predicted by the polycentromere model. These sites would appear as sites of high cenH3 occupancy in a population average. We indeed found that cenH3 was highly enriched at discrete, dispersed loci (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). As these loci appeared as very well-defined peaks, we removed background by subtracting the input signal and considered sites with 30 or more normalized counts (equivalent to the mean plus 7 times the standard deviation of the genome-wide signal) in at least one of two biological replicates as positive. We identified about 100 cenH3 peaks on each chromosome (707 peaks total; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), with the distance between peaks ranging from 290 bp to 1.9 Mb (median 83 kb; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). We averaged the signal around all 707 cenH3 peaks, represented by a single centered peak in the cenH3 ChIP data that is highly enriched compared to input (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The peaks were enriched in gene-poor regions of the genome (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). To our surprise, 607 out of 707 of these peaks resided outside of the domains described previously (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gassmann et al., 2012</a>) and corresponded to sites of only slight local cenH3 enrichment in the X-ChIP data (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). In the N-ChIP data, cenH3 occupancy was much higher at these peaks compared to the domains (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>).

We quantified MNase sensitivity at cenH3 peaks, at the nucleosomes immediately flanking the cenH3 peaks, and at the +1 nucleosomes by dividing the occupancy of these features at each time point by the occupancy at the first time point. This analysis revealed that cenH3 nucleosomes were more sensitive to MNase than both flanking and +1 nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These findings suggest that the sites of high cenH3 occupancy contain nucleosomes with similar properties as centromeric nucleosomes in other organisms."

To test if the signal at the cenH3 peaks results from KNL-2-dependent incorporation of cenH3, we analyzed the chromatin upon KNL-2 knockdown. KNL-2 depletion by RNAi led to an embryonic lethal phenotype with 99 \u00b1 1% penetrance (n = 8). We confirmed by microscopy that this was caused by chromosome segregation defects and found by immunofluorescence that the cenH3 signal became undetectable in embryos. These results were consistent with published findings (<a href=\"#bib39\">Maddox et al., 2007</a>) and suggested that our depletion of KNL-2 successfully reduced the presence of cenH3 and thus the functionality of centromeres.

To test if the cenH3 peaks indeed correspond to centromeric sites, we compared it to the kinetochore. Previous findings from our lab have suggested that in budding yeast the chromatin fraction that remains insoluble under native conditions after MNase digestion is strongly enriched for kinetochore complexes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Krassovsky et al., 2012</a>). As there is a one-to-one relationship between the centromere and the kinetochore in budding yeast, and the kinetochore components are conserved between eukaryotes, it can be inferred that kinetochore-bound chromatin remains mostly insoluble under these conditions. We therefore analyzed the distribution of the MNase fragments associated with the chromatin fraction that remained insoluble after MNase digestion and needle extraction and found peaks corresponding to each cenH3 peak (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). This suggested the presence of insoluble complexes, potentially kinetochores, at every cenH3 site in at least part of the cell population analyzed. The insoluble chromatin signal is reduced in <i>knl-2(RNAi)</i> embryos (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), supporting the interpretation that these peaks correspond to kinetochores. Interestingly, the peaks in the insoluble chromatin were more resistant to MNase than cenH3 nucleosomes in the soluble fraction, and the insoluble chromatin signal persisted even after 10 min of MNase digestion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), suggesting that the proteins that render cenH3 chromatin insoluble during extraction help to protect it from nuclease digestion."

This protein binds cenH3 and is required for the assembly of the kinetochore complex that links centromeric chromatin to the microtubule (<a href=\"#bib45\">Moore and Roth, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Oegema et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cheeseman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Carroll et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kato et al., 2013</a>). In fact, CENP-C can organize the entire functional kinetochore in the absence of cenH3 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gascoigne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Przewloka et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hori et al., 2013</a>). Although CENP-C remains with centromeric DNA throughout the cell cycle in other organisms, in <i>C. elegans</i> CENP-C localizes to chromatin only during mitosis, but not interphase, when it is in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib45\">Moore and Roth, 2001</a>). As a consequence, only a fraction of the cells analyzed contains CENP-C on chromatin, which limits the dynamic range of ChIP signal that is achievable. Because the kinetochore complex is highly insoluble, no DNA was recovered in native ChIP of CENP-C (data not shown). We therefore profiled CENP-C using MNase followed by formaldehyde crosslinking and solubilization with SDS. We found that CENP-C is enriched at cenH3 sites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a>). Neither the signal in the insoluble fraction nor the signal for CENP-C was enriched over the previously identified cenH3 domains compared to the rest of the genome (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Despite the presence of non-centromeric enrichment in the insoluble chromatin fraction and the lower dynamic range of the CENP-C ChIP data, we called peaks in these two data sets and compared them to the cenH3 peak calls. 460 of the 2060 insoluble chromatin peaks and 163 of the 347 insoluble chromatin peaks coincided with cenH3 peaks. In contrast, only 174 insoluble chromatin peaks and 26 CENP-C peaks fell within the domains, in both cases fewer sites than expected by chance (p&lt;0.001). Normalized to the genome coverage of domains and peaks, this amounts to an 800-fold enrichment of insoluble chromatin peaks and an almost 2000-fold enrichment of CENP-C peaks at cenH3 peaks compared to cenH3 domains (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). These results indicate that the cenH3 peaks identified in this study act as the preferred sites of kinetochore formation."

Moreover, the number of sites lies in the same order of magnitude as the number of microtubules observed during mitosis, thus providing a mechanistically reasonable alternative to the conundrum of how domains that cover half of the genome can organize a relatively small number of microtubule attachment sites."

To examine the size and positioning of the nucleosomes at the 707 centromeric sites, we divided the fragments in the input and cenH3 ChIP samples into size classes of fragments &gt;140 bp representing nucleosomes, and \u2264140 bp representing sub-nucleosome-sized particles. In the input sample, we found that two well-positioned nucleosomes flank the cenH3 peaks (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These nucleosomes are also visible in modENCODE data for mononucleosomes prepared under native conditions, but not upon formaldehyde-crosslinking, presumably because they become crosslinked to the centromere (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The native input sample also revealed the presence of sub-nucleosome-size fragments over the center of the cenH3 sites, while few of these fragments were found in the flanking regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In the cenH3 ChIP sample, only relatively few nucleosome-size fragments were recovered, while the majority of the signal came from fragments &lt;140 bp (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The insoluble chromatin showed a similar pattern, indicating that the particles bound to DNA at cenH3 sites are similar in the insoluble and in the soluble chromatin fractions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This analysis showed that centromeric sites consist of two well-positioned nucleosomes flanking a single cenH3 nucleosome that wraps less DNA than is wrapped by a canonical nucleosome."

In the input sample after 2 min of MNase digestion, the fragments that cross the dyad of the flanking nucleosomes show a distribution that peaks at 166 bp, consistent with canonical nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, black line). The peak lies at 166 bp rather than the 147 bp minimal protected fragment size for mononucleosomes because of the relatively light MNase digestion required to prevent the loss of cenH3 peaks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Progressive MNase digestion reduced the size of the DNA fragments protected by these particles in a manner expected for nucleosomes, analogous to the size pattern observed for bulk chromatin (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). A second peak representing dinucleosomes is also visible at about 330 bp (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, black line). The fragments that cross the center of the cenH3 nucleosomes in the cenH3 ChIP sample after 2 min of MNase digestion show a strikingly different distribution that is left-shifted and indicate that the nucleosomes that occupy these sites protect only about 60\u2013120 bp (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, blue line). The fragments in the insoluble chromatin fraction show a very similar distribution, supporting this size estimate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, magenta line). The dinucleosome peak in the cenH3 ChIP and insoluble chromatin, representing the centromeric nucleosome and one flanking canonical nucleosome, is equally left-shifted to about 260 bp (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, blue and magenta lines). These shorter dinucleosome fragments, protected by two neighboring nucleosomes on the same molecule of DNA, can only be explained by the presence of a smaller centromeric nucleosome, because the inferred size estimates are not affected by possible MNase encroachment on the centromeric nucleosome. After 10 min of MNase digestion, the peak of the distribution of MNase fragments that cross the center of the cenH3 sites in the insoluble fractions lies at 66 bp (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, magenta line), indicating that the minimal protected size of these particles lies in the 60\u2013100 bp range. Moreover, the width at half-height of the average 10 min-digested insoluble chromatin peak that aligns with the cenH3 peaks is 82 bp (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The inferred fragment size protected by the centromeric nucleosome is thus 60\u2013100 bp. These results confirm the findings in other organisms that cenH3 nucleosomes at centromeric sites in <i>C. elegans</i> wrap less DNA than that wrapped by canonical nucleosomes."

This level of protection is consistent with the findings in other organisms that cenH3 can incorporate into canonical-type nucleosomes away from centromeres, in some cases as cenH3-H3.3 heterotypic nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Camahort et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Krassovsky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lacoste et al., 2014</a>).

However, we could not identify a GAF/Trl homologue in the <i>C. elegans</i> genome. Instead, the motif we identified is almost identical to the motif associated with <i>C. elegans</i> high occupancy target (HOT) sites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). These sites were uncovered by the modENCODE consortium through binding-site analysis of 22 transcription factors and operationally defined as sites that are bound by \u226515 transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gerstein et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Niu et al., 2011</a>). The sequences at these sites do not contain DNA motifs of known <i>C. elegans</i> transcription factors and are therefore expected to bind transcription factors with low affinity. We found that 117 out of 248 HOT sites coincided with cenH3 sites (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; hypergeometric p=8.6 \u00d7 10<sup>\u2212161</sup>). Although this degree of overlap is striking, the actual overlap of cenH3 sites and transcription factor hotspots is likely to be much larger, given the fact that that only 22 transcription factors have been used for the definition of HOT sites, but that there are 934 predicted transcription factors encoded in the <i>C. elegans</i> genome (<a href=\"#bib54\">Reece-Hoyes et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gerstein et al., 2010</a>). We also found that HOT sites show a high signal for cenH3 ChIP, insoluble chromatin, CENP-C ChIP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) and well-positioned flanking nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Based on cytological observations two very different models for holocentricity were proposed more than 60 years ago: diffuse centromeres and polycentromeres (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schrader, 1947</a>). We use high resolution mapping of centromeric nucleosomes to demonstrate that the polycentromere model is correct for <i>C. elegans</i>, and that <i>C. elegans</i> holocentromeres consist of about 100 centromeric sites on each chromosome. The number of discrete centromeric sites is in excess over the observed number of microtubule attachments, which has been estimated to be \u223c100 for all six chromosomes by electron tomography (<a href=\"#bib51\">O\u2019Toole et al., 2003</a>). It is possible that only about 15% of the centromeric sites identified in this study are attached in each mitotic cell, which seems reasonable given that we analyzed a diverse cell population. The availability of multiple centromeric sites might reflect redundancy to assure faithful segregation in every cell cycle, although it is also possible that some sites are rendered inaccessible for cenH3 nucleosomes in some cell lineages due to changes in expression profiles during development."

It has previously been reported that these domains anti-correlate with transcription (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gassmann et al., 2012</a>), and we show that they also anti-correlate with H3.3 and correlate with H3K9me3. These correlations all indicate that cenH3 is preferentially located in regions of low nucleosome turnover, and the intrinsic instability of cenH3 nucleosomes may contribute to losing it from \u2018open\u2019 chromatin (<a href=\"#bib4\">Conde e Silva, 2007</a>). The domains are in part shaped by transcription in the germline and are present in the early embryo, however, there is no significant RNA Pol II-dependent transcription during the first two rounds of embryonic cell division. In contrast, H3.3 is deposited in the germline and has a well-established role in the inheritance of chromatin states (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ooi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ooi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jullien et al., 2012</a>). Specifically, H3.3 is retained both in mature sperm and oocytes, suggesting that it transmits epigenetic information through both the maternal and the paternal germline. The maintenance of H3.3 in sperm might explain how the domain pattern is established on paternal chromatin upon fertilization, even though cenH3 is not maintained in mature sperm (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gassmann et al., 2012</a>). However, because these domains do not align with the kinetochore, they probably do not have a direct centromere function, although they might serve as cenH3 \u2018reservoirs\u2019, in parallel with the suggestion that <i>Drosophila</i> transcription factor hotspots might serve as transcription factor reservoirs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Moorman et al., 2006</a>)."

Point centromeres are genetically defined in budding yeast, and satellite repeats help position centromeric nucleosomes at regional centromeres in many species. However, neo-centromeres can form on sequences that are not normally linked to centromeres (<a href=\"#bib41\">Marshall et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shang et al., 2013</a>). These observations suggest that centromeric nucleosomes are inherited in a sequence-independent way, so that it might seem surprising that a distinct sequence motif is associated with <i>C. elegans</i> centromeric sites. However, given that the motif is short and its abundance in the genome by far exceeds the number of centromeric sites, there is no evidence that it is a direct target for cenH3-nucleosome loading. Rather, the DNA at these sites might disfavor the formation of canonical nucleosomes, allowing centromeric nucleosomes to form in these \u2018gaps\u2019 in the chromatin landscape. A similar model for worm holocentromeres had been proposed by Gu and Fire (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gu and Fire, 2010</a>) based on finding \u223c120-bp \u2018holes\u2019 in the nucleosome landscape that could fit small nucleosomes the size of those previously shown for <i>Drosophila</i> cenH3 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dalal et al., 2007</a>)."

Opportunistic assembly of centromeric nucleosomes at sites of accessible DNA predicts that cenH3 will be loaded onto any fragment of DNA that contains accessible stretches. The fact that new extrachromosomal arrays initially partition passively and only acquire segregation competence after a few cell cycles indicates that centromeric competence can be acquired epigenetically in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yuen et al., 2011</a>), consistent with an opportunistic gap-filling model."

When cells exit the cell cycle and cenH3 is no longer expressed, \u2018holes\u2019 in the chromatin landscape might open up and allow HOT site transcription factors to bind by mass action. Although many HOT site transcription factors are cell type-specific, their non-specific binding to holes vacated by cenH3 nucleosomes would result in high HOT site transcription factor occupancy in multiple cell-types. Indeed, we found that cenH3 is lost in adult muscle cells, but that centromeric sites remain occupied, in part by the muscle-specific transcription factor HLH-1 and presumably also by other HOT site transcription factors. Virtually all transcription factors profiled in postembryonic tissues (larval instar 2 and later stages) were found at many, if not all centromeric sites. Replacement of cenH3 nucleosomes by transcription factors at HOT sites upon exit from the cell cycle may then result in their reported enhancer activity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kvon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2013</a>)."

These observations imply that the centromeric sites need to be marked during certain stages of the cell cycle in order to be repopulated at later stages. The coincidence of cenH3 and HOT sites raises the possibility that low-affinity binding of transcription factors by mass action prevents encroachment of nucleosomes and thus, helps to maintain holocentric sites over the course of development."

The number of inserts aligned to each 10-bp interval of the genome was counted, and the interval counts were normalized by dividing by the total number of counts for all intervals, and then scaled by multiplying by the number of bases in the genome. We considered fragments &gt;140 bp to represent nucleosomes, the in silico equivalent of excising a gel slice around the \u223c150-bp size range from an MNase-digested chromatin ladder and extracting the DNA for single-end sequencing. As we use a modified paired-end sequencing protocol to include all fragments &gt;25 bp (<a href=\"#bib22\">Henikoff et al., 2011</a>), we can accomplish the size cut more precisely by mapping only the reads in the nucleosome size range.

A previous study had mapped the centromeric histone cenH3 by ChIP-chip to large domains throughout the genome and concluded that the centromeres of C. elegans do not reside in discrete locations but form randomly in intergenic regions (\u201cdiffuse centromeres\u201d). This study uses a different method (ChIP-Seq) to map cenH3 and comes to a very different conclusion: in addition to the broad domains, they identify \u223c700 discrete locations for cenH3 and conclude that the centromeres of <i>C. elegans</i> are in fact similar to the point centromeres of yeast. The authors also describe that the centromeres correspond to the so-called \u201cHOT\u201d sites where transcription factors tend to accumulate in non-dividing cells. These observations are novel, resolve a long-standing question regarding the structure of holocentric chromosomes, and have intriguing implications for the formation and maintenance of centromeres."

We did not use the CENP-C data to call sites; only to confirm that the sites that we called based on cenH3 data were enriched in CENP-C, and the <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> heat map and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2B</a> boxplots clearly make this point. It shows that the enrichment of CENP-C at cenH3 sites is not restricted to the two example peaks shown and extends to the large majority of cenH3 sites genome-wide. We acknowledge that the CENP-C X-ChIP data are inherently much noisier than the cenH3 native ChIP data. The reason for this is at least in part biological, as cenH3 is present on chromatin through the vast majority of the cell cycle, while CENP-C was previously shown to be localized to cenH3 sites during mitosis, but not during interphase (Moore and Roth, 2001 PMID:11402064). As only a small fraction of the embryonic cells analyzed are in mitosis, the signal-to-noise ratio is inevitably much lower. Nevertheless, CENP-C ChIP signal-to-noise is sufficient to confirm that the cenH3 sites correspond to kinetochore sites, and we have further strengthened this conclusion as described below."

There are 347 CENP-C peaks, of which 163 overlap with the cenH3 sites, whereas only 26 CENP-C peaks overlap with the domains. Based on the fact that the coverage of cenH3 peaks is only 0.3% that of broad domains, the enrichment of CENP-C at cenH3 peaks relative to cenH3 domains is (163/26)/0.003 \u2248 2000-fold. Similarly, there are 2060 peaks in the insoluble chromatin, 460 of which coincide with the cenH3 peaks, compared to 147 for the domains, which implies a relative enrichment of insoluble chromatin at cenH3 peaks to cenH3 broad domains of (147/460)/0.003 \u2248 800-fold. Importantly, the densities of both CENP-C and insoluble chromatin peaks within the domains are significantly <i>lower</i> than within the rest of the genome. That is, our CENP-C ChIP data not only confirm that the cenH3 peaks are kinetochore sites, the data also argue against the hypothesis that broad domains harbor kinetochore sites.
