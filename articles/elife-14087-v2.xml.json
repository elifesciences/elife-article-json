                    "text": "Protein ubiquitination regulated by ubiquitin ligases plays important roles in innate immunity. However, key regulators of ubiquitination during innate response and roles of new types of ubiquitination (apart from Lys48- and Lys63-linkage) in control of innate signaling have not been clearly understood. Here we report that F-box only protein Fbxo21, a functionally unknown component of SCF (Skp1\u2013Cul1\u2013F-box protein) complex, facilitates Lys29-linkage and activation of ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1), and promotes type I interferon production upon viral infection. Fbxo21 deficiency in mice cells impairs virus-induced Lys29-linkage and activation of ASK1, attenuates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 signaling pathway, and decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferon, resulting in reduced antiviral innate response and enhanced virus replication. Therefore Fbxo21 is required for ASK1 activation via Lys29-linkage of ASK1 during antiviral innate response, providing mechanistic insights into non-proteolytic roles of SCF complex in innate immune response."

However, key regulators of ubiquitination during innate response and roles of new types of ubiquitination (apart from Lys48- and Lys63-linkage) in control of innate signaling have not been clearly understood. Here we report that F-box only protein Fbxo21, a functionally unknown component of SCF (Skp1\u2013Cul1\u2013F-box protein) complex, facilitates Lys29-linkage and activation of ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1), and promotes type I interferon production upon viral infection. Fbxo21 deficiency in mice cells impairs virus-induced Lys29-linkage and activation of ASK1, attenuates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 signaling pathway, and decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferon, resulting in reduced antiviral innate response and enhanced virus replication. Therefore Fbxo21 is required for ASK1 activation via Lys29-linkage of ASK1 during antiviral innate response, providing mechanistic insights into non-proteolytic roles of SCF complex in innate immune response."

Host cells can recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of invading pathogens via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), initiate signaling pathways to regulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFN\u00a0\u03b1/\u03b2) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yin et al., 2015</a>). Upon virus infection, host cells can also recognize viral components, especially nucleic acids derived from viral genome or produced during viral life cycle (<a href=\"#bib12\">G\u00fcrtler and Bowie, 2013</a>). Viral RNAs are mainly detected by RIG-I-like receptors (such as RIG-I and MDA5) that induce type I IFNs via MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein, also known as IPS1, Cardif and VISA)\u2013dependent activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)\u2013interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chan and Gack, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yoneyama et al., 2015</a>).

As compared to the typical single subunit E3 ligases (such as RING-finger type and HECT type E3 ligases), the Cullin-RING multisubunit ligase complexes are assembled on the cullin backbones and have been implicated in diverse processes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Skaar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">2014</a>).

In this complex, Skp1 binds to F-box domain of many F-box proteins. More than sixty F-box proteins have been identified up to date, and they have been classified into three categories: those with WD40 domain (Fbxw), those with leucine-rich repeats (Fbxl) and those with other diverse domains (Fbxo) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Skaar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">2014</a>). Despite great achievements have been made for elucidating the roles of SCF complexes in cancer (<a href=\"#bib35\">Skaar et al., 2014</a>), the function of SCF in immunity remains poorly understood. Possibly the best characterized SCF complexes associated with immunity are the F-box\u2013 and WD40 repeat\u2013containing Fbxw1 (also known as \u03b2-Trcp1, Fbw1a and Fwd1) and Fbxw11 (also known as \u03b2-TrCP2, Fbw11, Fbxw1b, Fbx1b and Hos) complexes that have been implicated in regulating NF-\u03baB signaling by degrading I\u03baB\u03b1 or processing of p100 (also known as NF\u03baB2) and p105 (also known as NF\u03baB1) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yaron et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Shirane et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Spencer et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Tan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wu and Ghosh, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Orian et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fong and Sun, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Lang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amir et al., 2004</a>).

More importantly, our study reveals a new type of Ub-modification (Lys29-linkage) in regulating kinase activation, and suggests that SCF complexes may not only mediate degradation of protein substrates but non-proteolytic regulation of substrates. Considering that ASK1 is a remarkably conserved kinase crucial in defense of infection (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ausubel, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Irazoqui et al., 2010</a>), our study may be of great significance for understanding of innate response in species other than mammals.

Many single subunit E3 ubiquitin ligases have been implicated in regulating innate immune response (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jiang and Chen, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zinngrebe et al., 2014</a>). However, little is known about the roles of the multisubunit ubiquitin ligases in innate immunity. In SCF complex, the recognition of substrate is determined by F-box proteins (<a href=\"#bib34\">Skaar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">2014</a>). Our study identifies Fbxo21 as a component of SCF complex and interacts with ASK1 to regulate the ubiquitination by SCF complex, thus expanding the family of SCF complex in immunity. Previously many SCF complexes have been reported whereas few of them are involved in innate immune response (<a href=\"#bib34\">Skaar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">2014</a>). The best examples may be SCF<sup>Fbxw1</sup> (\u03b2-Trcp1) and SCF<sup>Fbxw11</sup> (\u03b2-Trcp2) that mediate the processing of NF-\u03baB components and degradation of I\u03baB isoforms (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yaron et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Shirane et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Spencer et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Tan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wu and Ghosh, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Orian et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fong and Sun, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Lang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amir et al., 2004</a>). The SCF<sup>FBXW7\u03b1</sup> has also been implicated in processing p100 subunit of NF-\u03baB (<a href=\"#bib4\">Busino et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fukushima et al., 2012</a>). Fbxo3 has been implicated in the degradation of Fbxl2, leading to impaired degradation of TRAF proteins and exaggerated inflammatory response (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, <i>GogB</i> from <i>Salmonella</i> can interact with human Fbxo22 and inhibit inflammatory response (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pilar et al., 2012</a>). Our study suggests that Fbxo21 is required for innate antiviral response by activating ASK1-JNK signaling pathway, thus revealing an important role of Fbxo21 in innate immunity. More importantly, we have identified a new modification of ASK1, that is, Lys29-linkage of ASK1. Ub-modification of ASK1 has been reported previously. E3 ligases, such as cIAP-1, SOCS1, zinc-finger protein A20 and Stub1 (also known as CHIP), have been implicated in degradation of ASK1 and thus a negative regulator of JNK and/or p38 activation and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhao et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Won et al., 2010</a>). In all these studies, Ub-modifications lead to ASK1 degradation. Since most of SCF complexes mediate degradation of substrates (<a href=\"#bib34\">Skaar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">2014</a>), our finding of SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup>-mediated non-proteolytic polyubiquitination of ASK1 may indicate that SCF complexes may exert functions via non-proteolytic modification of substrates."

Ideally, the seven lysine residues of Ub (lys6, lys11, lys27, lys29, Lys33, lys48 and Lys63) can all be transferred to protein substrates by the ubiquitin system. Lys48-linkage and Lys63-linkage of Ub have been most extensively investigated. Similar to the effects of Lys63-linkage, Lys33-linkage of CD3\u03b6 promotes its phosphorylation and interaction with Zap70 and possibly the transport of CD3\u03b6 to lysosomes for degradation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ouchida et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Huang et al., 2010</a>). Recently our study revealed that K33-linkage of Zap70 by Nrdp1 promoted the dephosphorylation of Zap70 and thus terminated early TCR signaling in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). For the other types of Ub-modifications in innate response, little is known. TRAF6 has been implicated in Lys29-linkage but aggregation of huntingtin protein (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zucchelli et al., 2011</a>). The E3 ligase Itch may mediate Lys29-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of Notch (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chastagner et al., 2008</a>). Previously deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X is implicated in the removal of Lys29-linked ubiquitin from AMPK-related kinases (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Hakim et al., 2008</a>). Meanwhile, USP9X stabilizes ASK1 by removal of Ub chains from ASK1 and prevention of ASK1 degradation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Nagai et al., 2009</a>). Our study suggests that SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup> may be the ligase responsible for Lys29-linkage of ASK1 by demonstrating that Fbxo21 is required for Lys29-linkage of ASK1 upon viral infection, leading to non-proteolytic modification of ASK1 and ASK1 phosphorylation. Our data also indicate that Lys29-linkage of ASK1 could facilitate its phosphorylation and activation, and a crosstalk may exist between phosphorylation and Lys29-linked polyubiquitination."

In <i>Map3k5<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> MEFs, TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis and JNK activation are attenuated (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tobiume et al., 2001</a>). In <i>Map3k5<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> thymocytes, FasL-induced activation of JNK and p38 is decreased while the apoptosis of thymocytes is not significantly affected (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tobiume et al., 2001</a>). The primary neurons derived from <i>Map3k5<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mice are resistant to polyglutamine-induced cell death (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nishitoh et al., 2002</a>). More importantly, <i>Map3k5<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mice demonstrate increased resistance to TLR4, but not TLR3 and TLR9, engagement, accompanied by impaired p38 activation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Matsuzawa et al., 2005</a>). Upon infection with influenza virus, <i>Map3k5<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> MEFs show decreased JNK and p38 activation and inhibited cell death (<a href=\"#bib20\">Maruoka et al., 2003</a>). Despite these convincing results, roles of ASK1 in innate antiviral response are not fully elucidated. Our study suggests that ASK1 activation by SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup> is important in induction of type I IFN production, by using VSV and HSV-1 viruses as infection models. Our study also suggests that ASK1-mediated JNK activation, and to a lesser extent p38, is indispensable for type I IFN production, which is similar to the previous reports investigating TNF\u03b1-death receptor interaction (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tobiume et al., 2001</a>). Activity of ASK1 is regulated by many molecules that complex with ASK1 (ASK1 signalosome, about 1,500\u20132,000\u2009kDa), such as ASK1 itself, ASK1 homologues, thioredoxin, TRAF2, TRAF6 and Daxx etc. (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shiizaki et al., 2013</a>). More unidentified molecules in ASK1 signalosome may exist for modulation of ASK1 activation. It has been proposed that ASK1 is usually activated via autophosphorylation after TRAF2\u2212 and TRAF6\u2212assisted homodimerization in TNF\u03b1 response (<a href=\"#bib42\">Tobiume et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Noguchi et al., 2005</a>). In our study, we have found a complex containing Fbxo21 and SCF components, thus adding new components to ASK1 signalosome. Whether SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup> associates with other components in ASK1 signalosome may need further investigation, and whether SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup>-mediated ASK1 activation needs TRAF2 and TRAF6 or upstream kinases may also be worthy of more studies."

More importantly, we found that ASK1 deficient in Lys29-linkage could not rescue antiviral innate response in <i>Map3k5<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> RAW264.7 cells. Therefore, Fbxo21-mediated Ub-modification and activation of ASK1 are essential for innate antiviral response. It is interesting to find that JNK inhibitor could decrease the activation of IRF3 and type I IFN production. Previously it has been reported that JNK1/2 may be involved in activating IRF3 by phosphorylating IRF3 on Ser173 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>) or licensing TBK1-mediated IRF3 phosphorylation on Ser396 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nociari et al., 2009</a>), which may explain the effects of JNK1/2 inhibition on decreased innate antiviral response mediated by Fbxo21.

A microarray-based screen of Fbxo protein expression levels during viral infection identified Fbxo21 as being potentially involved in innate immune signaling. Using Fbxo21 knockout cells, the authors show that Fbxo21 plays an important role in the activation of innate immune signaling, specifically the production of cytokines and type I interferon, in response to viral infection. Using mass spectrometry analysis, the authors identify the protein kinase ASK1 as an interaction partner of Fbxo21. Through extensive characterization of ASK1 ubiquitination by SCF<sup>Fbxo21</sup>, the authors conclude that Fbxo21 acts by targeting six lysine residues (Lys946, Lys950, Lys951, Lys952, Lys953 and Lys957) in ASK1 for SCF-mediated non-degradative K29-linked ubiquitination. Finally, the authors provide data which show that K29-linked ubiquitination of ASK1 is critical for downstream activation of JNK1/2, p38, and IRF3 and thus cytokine responses to infection with VSV and HSV-1. The authors propose a model in which Fbxo21 targets ASK1 for K29-linked ubiquitination by the SCF complex, which enables ASK1 to activate various innate immune signaling molecules, ultimately resulting in the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and interferons."

Although ASK1 K13 mutant exhibited lower kinase activity, mutated sites in ASK1 K13 mutant might form different types of ubiquitin chain such as K48-linked or K63-linked, which might be involved in the regulation of ASK1 activity. To overcome this issue, the authors should measure ASK1 activity in Fbxo21-knockout cells and in MLN-4924-treated cells with or without virus infection.
