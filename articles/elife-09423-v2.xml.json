Acquiring novel skills usually requires exploration of the behavioral space, which is critical for learning (<a href=\"#bib25\">Skinner, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Sutton and Barto, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Grunow and Neuringer, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kao et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Olveczky et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Tumer and Brainard, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Miller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Wu et al., 2014</a>). It also requires the selection of the appropriate behavioral features that lead to the desired outcomes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Skinner, 1981</a>). It has been postulated that the motor system can learn complex movements by optimizing motor variability in task-relevant dimensions, correcting only deviations that interfere with the final output of the action (<a href=\"#bib27\">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Scott, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Valero-Cuevas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Diedrichsen et al., 2010</a>). By optimizing the precision of an action endpoint, for example, humans can perform smooth movements even in the presence of noise (<a href=\"#bib13\">Harris and Wolpert, 1998</a>). Selecting task-relevant features and decreasing task-relevant variability might therefore be a critical component of motor learning (<a href=\"#bib10\">Franklin and Wolpert, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cohen and Sternad, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Valero-Cuevas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Costa, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Shmuelof et al., 2012</a>)."

However, it is still unclear how the differential refinement of behavioral variability is encoded at the neural level. It has been suggested that cortical and basal ganglia circuits are important for the selection of task-relevant features (<a href=\"#bib5\">Costa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Barnes et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kao et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Olveczky et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jin and Costa, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Woolley et al., 2014</a>). Consistently, it has been previously shown that the initial stages of learning have increased behavioral (<a href=\"#bib28\">Tumer and Brainard, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jin and Costa, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Miller et al., 2010</a>) and neuronal (<a href=\"#bib5\">Costa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Barnes et al., 2005</a>) variability, but as specific movements are consolidated, neural variability is reduced in these circuits (<a href=\"#bib5\">Costa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kao et al., 2005</a>). This suggests that after initial motor and neural exploration, specific patterns are selected and consolidated (<a href=\"#bib4\">Costa, 2011</a>). In this study, we investigated if the dynamics of neural activity in cortical and striatal circuits reflect the changes of variability in specific behavioral domains, and if corticostriatal plasticity is critical for the refinement of particular behavior features."

In the fast press schedules we introduced a covert minimum frequency target, defined by the inverse of three consecutive inter-press intervals (3 IPIs, 4 presses), which increased across sessions from 0 Hz to a maximum of 4.5 Hz (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

A clear multimodal distribution became evident in log scale, with long IPIs (frequencies &lt;0.5 Hz, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) representing pauses in pressing or magazine checks. This allowed us to identify the sequences or bouts of pressing a posteriori, based on behavioral performance (either by a pause in pressing higher than 2 s or by the occurrence of checking behavior, i.e., magazine checks between presses; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), independently of the requirements for a specific training session. Importantly, reinforcement delivery did not provide an external cue that could be used by the animals to anticipate a reward, as the probability of performing a magazine check immediately after a successful covert target (instead of performing another press) was not significantly different from 0.5 both on early (t<sub>19</sub> = 0.9232, p = 0.3675) and late sessions (t<sub>19</sub> = 1.763, p = 0.0940), and did not change throughout learning (F<sub>8,152</sub> = 1.753, p = 0.0907, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, top right).

Importantly, the sequence-to-sequence variability of the behavioral parameters (measured both by the variance and by the Fano factor, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a>) was differentially modulated during training. While the variability of sequence frequency decreased significantly throughout training (variance: F<sub>8,152</sub> = 4.450, p &lt; 0.0001, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; Fano factor: F<sub>8,152</sub> = 5.343, p &lt; 0.0001, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), the variability of sequence duration significantly increased (variance: F<sub>8,152</sub> = 11.15, p &lt; 0.0001, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; Fano factor: F<sub>8,152</sub> = 16.86, p &lt; 0.0001, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). The sequence-to-sequence variability of these two behavioral features was independent as there was no correlation between the variability in sequence frequency and the variability in sequence duration (variance: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.0135; Fano factor: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.0119, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The decrease in frequency variability cannot be explained by animals reaching a ceiling in pressing frequency, since the average frequency did not increase with training (it actually decreased slightly). Furthermore, frequency variability started stabilizing after session 4 where the target constrains are still rather loose (3 IPIs in less than 4 s) and this is a frequency that animals can reach in 78.91 \u00b1 5.09% of the sequences at the end of training."

We therefore investigated if the changes in sequence-to-sequence variability in neural activity were related to the changes in sequence-to-sequence variability of specific behavioral dimensions. We re-calculated the Fano factor of the behavioral features and the neuronal activity using a moving average of a reduced number of trials (5) to provide a higher within session resolution of the variability dynamics and therefore permit the correlation of behavioral and neuronal dynamics across training for each animal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Analyses of the relationship between the variability of the recorded units and the variability of each independent behavior feature revealed a significant increase in correlation between neuronal and behavior variability, specific for sequence frequency (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), but not for duration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). These results were observed when using only task-relevant or non-task-relevant neurons (data not shown).

When mice were asked to perform progressively faster covert patterns of lever presses to obtain a reinforcer, they reduced variability in sequence frequency, but increased variability in an orthogonal uncorrelated feature (sequence duration). These results are interesting because both features would be classically considered task-relevant\u2014a covert sequence of four presses, which is the minimum to produce a reinforcer in this task, has to have a minimal duration. However, although both features could be considered relevant for the task, only changes in frequency variability were differentially reinforced. Reinforced sequences had lower variability in frequency than non-reinforced sequences, but had equal variability in duration as non-reinforced sequences. Thus, our results indicate that animals reduced frequency variability because that was what was reinforced throughout training. Consistent with this interpretation, in a task where the exact number of presses (correlated with duration) was reinforced but the frequency at which the sequence was performed was not, variability in duration decreased and in frequency increased. This in line with data demonstrating differential modulation of the different components of task space during learning (<a href=\"#bib27\">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">M\u00fcller and Sternad, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cohen and Sternad, 2009</a>)."

However, when faced with a more challenging task as in the present study, they decreased variability in the domain that was critical for getting a reinforcer, but increased variability in orthogonal domains (i.e., they were more stereotypical in just a particular domain). It could be that the increase in variability in the orthogonal behavioral domains happens because in difficult tasks animals try to minimize the effort to obtain reinforcers, and hence do not attempt to reduce variability in more than one independent domain. Alternatively, it could also be that mice increased the duration of the sequence (and the correlated number of presses) as a strategy to try to increase the probability of getting a successful covert pattern in that sequence. However, this second possibility is less likely, given that the two behavioral features were not correlated, and that sequences of different durations were equally likely to get reinforced. These data suggest that in more challenging motor tasks it is difficult to reduce variability in all domains, and animals seem to differentially refine the motor patterns that led to reinforcement. Consistently, the number of sequences that comply with the minimum frequency required for the last session (end-target) increased with training and the distance to the end-target decreased with training, indicating that mice implicitly learned to shape their behavior to match the task requirements."

It has been suggested that a decrease in corticostriatal variability as a motor task is learned (<a href=\"#bib5\">Costa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Barnes et al., 2005</a>) could correspond to the process of selection and consolidation of specific motor patterns (<a href=\"#bib4\">Costa, 2011</a>). Here, we show that this decrease in neural variability in corticostriatal circuits correlates specifically with the decrease in variability of a particular behavior domain. These data suggest that the neural patterns in motor cortex and sensorimotor striatum that give rise to the behavioral patterns that are reinforced are progressively selected. Provocatively, it also suggests that changes in motor variability that are not specifically reinforced but are part of a strategy or driven by effort reduction may be encoded somewhere else."

A retractable lever was extruded in the beginning of each session, simultaneous to the onset of a light. Animals were required to perform a sequence of presses at a minimum frequency in order to obtain a 20 mg food pellet (Bio-Serv, Flemington, NJ, United States). 24 hr before the first training session animals were placed under a food restriction schedule. Body weight was constantly monitored in order to be kept above 85% of the initial weight. In order to facilitate learning, animals were initially exposed to one session of magazine training were food pellets would be available on a random time schedule, and to three sessions of continuous reinforcement schedule (CRF) 1 day before training, where single lever presses would be reinforced. On the following training sessions animals were reinforced if they performed a sequence of consecutive presses at a minimum frequency (covert target), defined by the inverse of three consecutive inter-press intervals (IPIs), which increased with training. On the first session there was no minimum frequency target, meaning that any consecutive 3 IPIs would lead to reinforcement. In consecutive sessions the minimum frequency that would lead to reinforcement was increased or maintained in the following order: 0.375 Hz, 0.75 Hz, 0.75 Hz, 1.5 Hz, 3 Hz, 3 Hz, 4.5 Hz and 4.5 Hz. This constant increase in the minimum frequency of the covert target forced the animals to systematically adapt to the task requirements and perform faster sequences of presses from session to session. The training protocol for mutant animals and littermate controls was adapted due to difficulties learning the task, to one daily session and using automatic progressive schedules once a minimum number of reinforcements (30 or 10) was achieved.

Normality was verified for all tests using the D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test, or the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test when sample size was too small. Repeated measures ANOVA were used to evaluate changes in behavior and neuronal features. Probability of a magazine check after lever-press was evaluated using one-way ANOVA and post hoc comparisons using Fisher's LSD test, but one subject was excluded from these analysis due to a lack of recorded timestamps for magazine head-entries. Paired t-tests were used to evaluate differences in percentage of lever-presses. Increases in FF modulation were assessed by the Wilcoxon Rank Signed test. Repeated measures two-way ANOVA was used to verify the general effect of the <i>RGS9-NR1</i> mutants experiment. Bootstrapping statistics were used on the data from the <i>RGS9-NR1</i> mutants and littermate controls to validate the results from the post hoc tests. Histograms were built from 100000 randomized samples with replacement. Sample sizes were calculated based on \u03b1 = 0.05 and power of 0.7. Trial to trial variability of neuronal and behavior data was assessed using Fano factor. We calculate the Fano factor of individual units by dividing the variance of firing rates across all the trials of a session by the mean over those trials. Fano factor and firing rate modulations for individual stable cells were calculated as the ratio between the difference of values for sequence and baseline and the values during baseline (Fano factor: [FF<sub>sequence</sub> \u2212 FF<sub>baseline</sub>]/FF<sub>baseline</sub>; firing rate: [FR<sub>sequence</sub> \u2212 FR<sub>baseline</sub>]/FR<sub>baseline</sub>). Fano factor of the behavioral features was calculated by dividing the variance in the individual features by the mean of the feature for all the trials. To establish correlations between the variability of the neuronal data and the variability of the behavior, Fano factors were calculated using three, five or seven consecutive trials, allowing us to increase the resolution of the variability measures. Correlations between neuronal and behavior data were evaluated using Pearson's linear correlations. To avoid correlations bias due to sample size, statistical significance of all the correlations was assessed using the significance criteria for the session with smaller size. Within animal correlations averaged using Fisher's z transformation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Silver and Dunlap, 1987</a>) returned similar results to grouped correlations for all the tested conditions (data not shown)."

It also should be clear that the effect is not just the out of sequence presses that decrease rather than the in sequence that increase. For analysis of the neuron data is should be clear that on what segment the firing rate is measured. If the firing rate is measured on the entire duration of the pressing sequence then it is liable to the same criticism as pointed out above.

By requiring mice to increase peak press frequency in order to obtain reward, the authors found that variability in press frequency is selectively decreased. Such a reduction in behavioral variability is correlated with a concomitant reduction in M1/DS neuronal activity variability over learning blocks, and abolished in mice with deficient corticostriatal plasticity. These results are potentially very interesting in that they provide elegant experimental support for a widely-held prediction in motor control literature, and also provide a new conceptual framework to analyze behavioral and neuronal dynamics during learning when the mapping between neuronal activity and behavior continues to evolve.

However, after comparing the current results with those in Xin and Costa (2010) and Xin, Tecuapetla, and Costa (2014), I think it is likely the case that, in earlier studies, mice learn to optimize the number of press under extended FR4 or FR8 training protocol, and thus specifically reduced variability for the number of presses."

The use of FF to investigate the evolution of neural coding during learning is very clever because, without knowing exactly what behavioral parameters M1/DS activity encode and how the encoding may evolve during learning, the FF correlation strongly supports that M1/DS activity must encode properties related to the average press frequency."

But if we assume that what they call sequence frequency in 2A is in fact pressing frequency (I have no idea if that's the case, but it's a fair assumption given the rest of the paper), then I become confused, because <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1C and D</a> clearly shows that instantaneous pressing frequency is increased with learning, yet 2A suggest otherwise."

If one wanted to make the claim that the mouse decreases the variability in the task relevant dimension over other task-irrelevant ones, then one should design a task that has two explicit and comparable dimensions and make reward contingent first on one and then the other in separate experiments. For example, one could make the first interval in 3-tap sequence subject to some reward criteria, but the second interval not, and then switch it up in the next experiment. If variability decreases for the relevant interval but not the irrelevant one no matter which the reward was contingent on, then that would, to me at least, be a far more compelling result. As it stands they are comparing dimensions that both seem relevant for reward, one which has an increase in variability with learning, another which has a decrease."

In particular further evidence to support that outcome specificity was restricted to press frequency was requested. The authors have provided new analysis and a set of new experiments to meet these concerns. However, while the reviewers agree that the study has improved after revision the issue of outcome-specificity is still not resolved. Given the paper's focus, this is a major issue that must be addressed. After extensive discussion among reviewers, and editors there is an agreement that the task as presented does not isolate frequency as the only causal dimension in the task. The fact that reward is dispensed based on frequency does not preclude other relevant behavioral parameters, even if those are orthogonal to, or uncorrelated with, sequence frequency. In fact, both sequence frequency and duration are modulated by learning. Success on the task is therefore likely to also depend on duration since it is coupled to sequence length. Therefore, the task does not isolate frequency as the only task-relevant parameter, and the dichotomy between task-relevant (frequency) and task-irrelevant (duration) parameters does not hold. Hence it cannot be claimed that learning is only tuning frequency as the outcome-relevant parameter. Duration is relevant by default in reward accumulation tasks. This may not be reflected in the tuning of neuronal firing patterns while frequency may in this task. This distinction may be interesting but is not spelled out in the manuscript. Careful wording is needed to clarify this and to discuss how the two outcome-relevant parameters that are being compared, sequence frequency and duration, differ. This is important because the difference in the neural correlates of these task aspects, and how they change with learning, is not due to one being task-relevant and the other not, but rather to these being qualitatively different aspects of the task. As the text is now this is not the message the reader will be left with. Thus the dimension along which the two task-relevant parameters differ should be discussed, and an attempt to generalize the results beyond this task should be made. The authors must revise their statements carefully to reflect this and explicitly explain the confounding factor introduced by press duration. This new message should also be reflected in the title and in a more nuanced description in the Abstract, and Introduction of the outcome relevant concept as well as in an expanded discussion of these issues."

There were several concerns whether the main claims of the manuscript as submitted before were supported by the data as presented. In particular further evidence to support that outcome specificity was restricted to press frequency was requested. The authors have provided new analysis and a set of new experiments to meet these concerns. However, while the reviewers agree that the study has improved after revision the issue of outcome-specificity is still not resolved. Given the paper's focus, this is a major issue that must be addressed. After extensive discussion among reviewers, and editors there is an agreement that the task as presented does not isolate frequency as the only causal dimension in the task. The fact that reward is dispensed based on frequency does not preclude other relevant behavioral parameters, even if those are orthogonal to, or uncorrelated with, sequence frequency. In fact, both sequence frequency and duration are modulated by learning. Success on the task is therefore likely to also depend on duration since it is coupled to sequence length. Therefore, the task does not isolate frequency as the only task-relevant parameter, and the dichotomy between task-relevant (frequency) and task-irrelevant (duration) parameters does not hold. Hence it cannot be claimed that learning is only tuning frequency as the outcome-relevant parameter. Duration is relevant by default in reward accumulation tasks. This may not be reflected in the tuning of neuronal firing patterns while frequency may in this task. This distinction may be interesting but is not spelled out in the manuscript. Careful wording is needed to clarify this and to discuss how the two outcome-relevant parameters that are being compared, sequence frequency and duration, differ. This is important because the difference in the neural correlates of these task aspects, and how they change with learning, is not due to one being task-relevant and the other not, but rather to these being qualitatively different aspects of the task. As the text is now this is not the message the reader will be left with. Thus the dimension along which the two task-relevant parameters differ should be discussed, and an attempt to generalize the results beyond this task should be made. The authors must revise their statements carefully to reflect this and explicitly explain the confounding factor introduced by press duration. This new message should also be reflected in the title and in a more nuanced description in the Abstract, and Introduction of the outcome relevant concept as well as in an expanded discussion of these issues.</i>"

We believe that these are misunderstandings and do not affect the main message of the paper. So we carefully revised the manuscript as suggested, and abandoned the outcome-relevant/outcome- irrelevant nomenclature to refer to the different behavior dimensions. We now say that animals trained in a task to perform progressively faster sequences of lever presses reduced variability of sequence frequency but increased variability in an orthogonal domain (sequence duration as training progressed, variability in corticostriatal activity decreased and became progressively more correlated with behavioral variability, but only for sequence frequency. Corticostriatal plasticity was required for the reduction in frequency variability, but not for variability in sequence duration. We believe that these statements are not controversial."

For the range of variability in duration observed in the task presented, there is no difference in variability between reinforced and non-reinforced trials; meaning that reinforced trials have the same variance/variability in duration as non-reinforced trials (and actually no difference in duration per se) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In contrast, reinforced trials do have much lower variability in frequency than non-reinforced trials (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). It is therefore plausible that animals reduced the variability in the domain that changed the probability of reinforcement. Therefore, in order to clarify this message and our claims, we have carefully revised and altered the title, Abstract and main text of the manuscript."
