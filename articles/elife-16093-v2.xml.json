                    "text": "KCa2.1, KCa2.2, KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 constitute a family of mammalian small- to intermediate-conductance potassium channels that are activated by calcium-calmodulin. KCa3.1 is unique among these four channels in that activation requires, in addition to calcium, phosphorylation of a single histidine residue (His358) in the cytoplasmic region, by nucleoside diphosphate kinase-B (NDPK-B). The mechanism by which KCa3.1 is activated by histidine phosphorylation is unknown. Histidine phosphorylation is well characterized in prokaryotes but poorly understood in eukaryotes. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of His358 activates KCa3.1 by antagonizing copper-mediated inhibition of the channel. Furthermore, we show that activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells deficient in intracellular copper exhibit increased KCa3.1 histidine phosphorylation and channel activity, leading to increased calcium flux and cytokine production. These findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism for a mammalian potassium channel and for T-cell activation, and highlight a unique feature of histidine versus serine/threonine and tyrosine as a regulatory phosphorylation site."

KCa3.1 is unique among these four channels in that activation requires, in addition to calcium, phosphorylation of a single histidine residue (His358) in the cytoplasmic region, by nucleoside diphosphate kinase-B (NDPK-B). The mechanism by which KCa3.1 is activated by histidine phosphorylation is unknown. Histidine phosphorylation is well characterized in prokaryotes but poorly understood in eukaryotes. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of His358 activates KCa3.1 by antagonizing copper-mediated inhibition of the channel. Furthermore, we show that activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells deficient in intracellular copper exhibit increased KCa3.1 histidine phosphorylation and channel activity, leading to increased calcium flux and cytokine production. These findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism for a mammalian potassium channel and for T-cell activation, and highlight a unique feature of histidine versus serine/threonine and tyrosine as a regulatory phosphorylation site."

We also showed that KCa3.1 activation requires phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Srivastava et al., 2006a</a>), generated by a class II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K-C2\u03b2) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Srivastava et al., 2009</a>), and that KCa3.1 is negatively regulated by protein histidine phosphatase-1 (PHPT1), which dephosphorylates pHis358 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Srivastava et al., 2008</a>), and by myotubularin-related protein-6 (MTMR6), which dephosphorylates PI(3)P (<a href=\"#bib25\">Srivastava et al., 2005</a>). In addition, we recently identified phosphoglycerate mutase-5 (PGAM5) as a histidine phosphatase that specifically dephosphorylates the catalytic histidine (His118) in NDPK-B. By dephosphorylating NDPK-B, PGAM5 negatively regulates T-cell receptor signaling by inhibiting NDPK-B-mediated histidine phosphorylation and activation of KCa3.1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Panda et al., 2016</a>)."

In addition to KCa3.1, histidine phosphorylation of several mammalian proteins by NDPKs has been reported, including the \u03b2 subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins and the transient receptor potential vanilloid-5 (TRPV5) channel (<a href=\"#bib2\">Attwood and Wieland, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Klumpp and Krieglstein, 2009</a>).

Here, we provide evidence for copper-mediated inhibition of KCa3.1 from patch-clamping studies of KCa3.1 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from copper transporter-1 (Ctr1) knockout mice.

Furthermore, the ability of copper to inhibit KCa3.1 is inversely dependent on the calcium concentration: approximately 1 \u00b5M CuCl<sub>2</sub> was required for inhibition\u00a0at 10 \u00b5M CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), versus 100 nM CuCl<sub>2</sub>\u00a0at 300 nM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Upon a marked increase in intracellular calcium levels due to T-cell stimulation (for example), calcium binding to channel-associated calmodulin induces conformational changes in the channel, distorting the four-helix bundle locally (the C-terminal four-helix bundle is maintained) and partially destabilizing copper binding to His358, thus exposing it to phosphorylation by NDPK-B. Because stable copper binding requires tetravalent coordination, phosphorylation of a single His358 residue\u00a0(on N3) in the tetramer is probably sufficient to abrogate copper binding and inhibition of KCa3.1. Unencumbered by copper, the channel-opening conformational changes induced by calcium proceed in the same manner in KCa3.1 as in the other three KCa channels. Consistent with our model, (i) NDPK-B or TTM activation of KCa3.1 required calcium to be present concurrently (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), (ii) copper did not inhibit NDPK-B-activated (phosphorylated) KCa3.1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and (iii) KCa3.1 was hyperphosphorylated on histidine (and more active) in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from <i>Ctr1</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), which contain lower intracellular copper levels."

In the basal state (no calcium; left panel), the CaM C lobe (green sphere) is bound to the N-terminal segment of the calmodulin-binding domain (CBD, yellow) in KCa3.1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Schumacher et al., 2004</a>). The transmembrane S6 helices close off the channel on the cytoplasmic side. At the C\u00a0terminus of KCa3.1 is a coiled-coil region that forms a four-helix bundle (violet cylinders; S.R.H., unpublished data). Based on coiled-coil prediction software, it is probable that the region containing His358, which is just C-terminal to the CBD, also forms a four-helix bundle (maroon cylinders), with His358 (pentagon) occupying an inward-facing \u2018a\u2019 position in the heptad repeat. This would position the four copies of His358 for coordination of a Cu(II) ion on the axis of the four-helix bundle, which would stabilize the four-helix bundle and act to resist the conformational changes induced by calcium binding to the CaM N lobe (blue sphere). An increase in intracellular calcium induces conformational changes in the CBD that partially destabilize copper binding\u00a0(middle panel), providing access to His358 for phosphorylation by NDPK-B (or copper chelation by TTM). Upon phosphorylation of His358, copper binding is abrogated, and the calcium-induced conformational changes in the CBD lead to channel opening (right panel; exact mechanism not known) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Sachyani et al., 2014</a>)."

We think that the difference in activity is due to the failure of TTM (applied exogenously) to chelate all of the copper bound to KCa3.1 in WT MEFs. In fact, this is consistent with our findings that calcium binding to calmodulin is required for TTM to chelate copper away from KCa3.1 (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Since intracellular calcium concentrations are unlikely to be saturating, TTM should not be able to chelate all of the channel-bound copper."

Suggestively, in this structure, His389 (31 residues C-terminal to the phosphorylation site, His358) occupies an inward-facing \u2018a\u2019 position in the heptad repeat, and the four copies of His389 (via N3 in the imidazole ring), along with an axial water molecule, bind a Cu(II) ion on the four-fold axis. (CuCl<sub>2</sub> was added prior to crystallization trials.) The N3 (imidazole ring)-Cu(II) distance is 2.0\u00c5 (C4 symmetry\u2013all four the same), and the O (H<sub>2</sub>O)-Cu(II) distance is 2.4\u00c5. This structure demonstrates that four histidine residues in the \u2018a\u2019 position of a four-helix bundle (in a homotetramer) are capable of binding a Cu(II) ion on the four-fold axis. Based on coiled-coil prediction software (see Minor Point #5 below), our model is that His358 is also positioned in an \u2018a\u2019 position in a four-helix bundle, coordinating a Cu(II) ion on the four-fold axis similar to His389."

(Nature 410, 1120 (2001)) is artifactual and that their dimer-dimer model for the open-channel state is not correct. The fundamental reason for believing their model is incorrect is that the dimer-dimer model is incompatible with the C4 symmetry of the homotetrameric SK/KCa channels. We believe that the 2:2 complex they observed in solution and in the crystal structure (with calcium present) is an artifact of the C-terminal 6xHis-tag included, which contained a heterologous leucine residue (<span class=\"underline\">L</span>EHHHHHH) that interacts with the second molecule of CaM in the dimer (i.e., this might help to stabilize the 2:2 complex). Our solution data (unpublished), as well as data published by Halling et al. (J. Gen. Physiol. 143, 231 (2014)), show unequivocally a 1:1 SK2 (or SK4):CaM complex, with or without calcium present. Four 1:1 complexes can be assembled into a structure that is consistent with the C4 symmetry of the channel. Such a model was proposed by Sachyani et al. (Structure 22, 1582 (2014)) for Kv7.1, which is also activated by calcium-CaM and shows sequence similarity with the KCa channels in the CaM binding domain. We favor this model for KCa3.1-CaM in the open state, which is why this paper and not the Schumacher et al. (2001) paper is referenced in the new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> legend."
