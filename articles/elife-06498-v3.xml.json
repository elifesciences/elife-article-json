In this study, we report the discovery of a novel patient selection strategy for the p53\u2013HDM2 inhibitor NVP-CGM097, currently under evaluation in clinical trials. By intersecting high-throughput cell line sensitivity data with genomic data, we have identified a gene expression signature consisting of 13 up-regulated genes that predicts for sensitivity to NVP-CGM097 in both cell lines and in patient-derived tumor xenograft models. Interestingly, these 13 genes are known p53 downstream target genes, suggesting that the identified gene signature reflects the presence of at least a partially activated p53 pathway in NVP-CGM097-sensitive tumors. Together, our findings provide evidence for the use of this newly identified predictive gene signature to refine the selection of patients with wild-type p53 tumors and increase the likelihood of response to treatment with p53\u2013HDM2 inhibitors, such as NVP-CGM097."

In this study, we report the discovery of a novel patient selection strategy for the p53\u2013HDM2 inhibitor NVP-CGM097, currently under evaluation in clinical trials. By intersecting high-throughput cell line sensitivity data with genomic data, we have identified a gene expression signature consisting of 13 up-regulated genes that predicts for sensitivity to NVP-CGM097 in both cell lines and in patient-derived tumor xenograft models. Interestingly, these 13 genes are known p53 downstream target genes, suggesting that the identified gene signature reflects the presence of at least a partially activated p53 pathway in NVP-CGM097-sensitive tumors. Together, our findings provide evidence for the use of this newly identified predictive gene signature to refine the selection of patients with wild-type p53 tumors and increase the likelihood of response to treatment with p53\u2013HDM2 inhibitors, such as NVP-CGM097."

Scientists are developing anticancer drugs that work by targeting HDM2; this frees p53 and allows it to wipe out cancerous cells.

But about 60% of the cancer cells that have normal p53 proteins also did not respond to the anti-HDM2 therapy. This finding indicates that the presence of normal p53 protein is necessary but not sufficient for tumor cells to respond to anti-HDM2 therapy."

The analysis showed that a group of 13 genes are expressed more in the cells that responded to the drug. All 13 genes are unexpectedly direct targets of p53, suggesting that p53 remains active in these tumor cells, even if it is not working optimally. To verify these results, Jeay et al. grew human tumors in mice and found that tumors with high expression of the 13 genes are sensitive to the anti-HDM2 drug (called NVP-CGM097). The experiments strongly suggest that this 13-gene signature can be used to determine if a patient with cancer will respond to anti-HDM2 therapy. Following on from this work, researchers have already launched an early clinical trial with the anti-HDM2 drug and will test whether this gene signature is indeed useful in a real clinical setting."

In its normal state, the p53 transcription factor acts in response to oncogenic or other stress signals to induce or repress a variety of target genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cellular senescence (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vogelstein et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Harris and Levine, 2005</a>). In normal cells, the levels of p53 protein are tightly regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2 that targets p53 for ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Haupt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kubbutat et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Marine and Lozano, 2010</a>). In addition, HDM2 binding to p53 blocks its transactivation domain preventing p53 transcriptional activation of its target genes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Momand et al., 1992</a>). HDM2 is itself a p53 target gene and hence acts as part of a negative feedback loop which maintains low cellular concentrations of both partners under non-stressed conditions (<a href=\"#bib40\">Picksley and Lane, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wu et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Freedman et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Michael and Oren, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bond et al., 2005</a>)."

In many cancers where <i>TP53</i> is not mutated, the function of the p53 pathway is often compromised through other mechanisms, including HDM2 gain of function by amplification and/or overexpression (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bond et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Vousden and Lane, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wade et al., 2010</a>). In these instances blocking the interaction between p53 and HDM2 is hypothesized to stabilize p53 leading to pathway activation and growth arrest and/or apoptosis in cancer. Based on this hypothesis and the structural elucidation of the p53\u2013HDM2 interaction, several HDM2 small molecule inhibitors have been developed and are now in clinical trials. Indeed, prior work has shown that in human cancer cell lines or xenografts such inhibitors can elicit potent anti-tumor effects as a result of induction of cell cycle growth arrest and an apoptotic response (<a href=\"#bib41\">Poyurovsky and Prives, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cheok et al., 2011</a>)."

In order to identify patients most likely to respond to inhibitors of HDM2, we sought to develop patient selection biomarkers based on large-scale cancer cell line profiling. The analysis of sensitivity profiles across 356 cell lines led to the confirmation that p53 mutant cancer cells fail to respond to HDM2 inhibitors. However, among wild-type p53 cancer cells sensitivity was heterogeneous and not solely associated with HDM2 gene amplification. Using an unbiased discovery approach, the expression of 13 genes (including HDM2) was found to have robust and superior predictive value for response compared to p53 wild-type status alone. This novel 13-gene signature was validated both in vitro and in vivo, and has the potential to improve the selection strategy of patients bearing p53 wild-type tumors who are most likely to respond to treatment with NVP-CGM097. Surprisingly, all 13 genes were p53 target genes suggesting that cells harboring at least partially activated p53 are those that are most susceptible to further p53 activation upon disruption of the p53\u2013HDM2 interaction."

Both NVP-CFC218 and NVP-CGM097 displaced the p53 peptide from the surface of HDM2 with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 nM and 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 nM, respectively. In contrast, both compounds were substantially less active against HDMX with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1300 \u00b1 100 nM and 2000 \u00b1 300 nM.

After quality control and manual curation of the dose response curves, a total of 356 cell lines met the cell viability quality criteria for NVP-CFC218 and were used for subsequent analyses. Cell lines were partitioned into sensitive and insensitive groups based on compound potency (IC<sub>50</sub>). A rank-order plot of IC<sub>50</sub>s for NVP-CFC218 showed a natural cut-off of 4 \u03bcM, which was used to categorize cell lines. Forty seven cell lines were categorized as sensitive and 309 cell lines as insensitive. For the sensitive cell lines, the maximal compound effect level (Amax) was \u2264 \u221250% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). As expected, based on the mechanism of action of NVP-CFC218, most of the sensitive cell lines harbored wild-type p53 (n = 43) and this association was statistically significant by Fisher's exact test (p-value = 5.1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221223</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

To build a predictive model, we used bootstrapping, whereby the cell lines were randomly split into training and testing sets. Within each bootstrapped data split where 2/3 of the data was used for training and 1/3 for testing, we used the Wilcoxon uni-variate test to select features that were significantly differentially expressed between sensitive and insensitive lines. Using the selected features, a na\u00efve Bayes classifier was trained to predict sensitivity status. The number of features selected varied from 5 to 100 and for each, 20 bootstrapped data splits were conducted.

In order to exclude this possibility, we assessed the presence of the signature in primary human tumor samples. For this purpose, we used the 13-gene signature, associated with the na\u00efve Bayes predictive model trained on cell line data, to interrogate a collection of \u223c21,300 human tumor samples for which the whole genome expression profiles are available. Here, we reasoned that the proportion of samples of any given lineage that scored positively for the signature would be a measure of the concordance between cell line expression data and primary human tumor data. The specific proportion of any given lineage among primary human tumor samples scoring positive for the presence of the 13-gene signature (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) was found to be very similar to the lineage proportions of signature positive, sensitive cell lines in the CCLE (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), as probed by the NVP-CFC218 chemical sensitivity experiment described above. These data suggest that the 13-gene signature is not likely an artifact of the in vitro culture. In keeping with this observation, the 13-gene signature identified a fraction of predicted sensitive human primary tumor samples within our patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) collection (n = 503) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), thus allowing the selection of models for further in vivo validation of its predictive power. In summary, these analyses provide an estimation of the prevalence of 13-gene signature positivity across various cancer indications and underscore additional cancer types with high signature positivity, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma that may have been underrepresented in the in vitro cell line profiling approach."

First, the pharmacodynamic effects and optimal daily dose of NVP-CGM097 were determined in the cell line-derived SJSA-1 osteosarcoma xenograft model that harbors an amplification of the <i>HDM2</i> gene. A single oral dose of NVP-CGM097, 100 mg/kg, led to stabilization of p53 and elevation of p53 target genes such as <i>CDKN1A</i> (p21) at the mRNA level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, left) and at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, right). Treatment of SJSA-1 xenografted tumors with NVP-CGM097 led to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition with 65% tumor regression at 100 mg/kg daily (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, left) and was well tolerated as measured by body weight (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, right). The anti-tumor activity of NVP-CGM097 correlated well with a dose-dependent induction in tumors of p21 and HDM2 at the mRNA level and/or protein levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Thus, based on these results, the dose and schedule chosen for the follow up in vivo validation of the 13-gene signature was established at 100 mg/kg NVP-CGM097 given orally, once daily."

As to compare with Nutlin 3a, NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218 show differences in binding mode within the p53 binding site of HDM2 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jeay et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Valat et al., 2014</a>, manuscript in preparation), which allows better in vitro and in vivo on-target potency, more favorable drug-like properties, and improved in vivo behavior of this compound family (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ferretti et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jeay et al., 2014</a>). NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218 were first tested in cell-free assays, where both were shown to selectively inhibit p53\u2013HDM2 binding. In cells, consistent with their mechanism of action (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheok et al., 2011</a>) and in line with their highly selective nature, both compounds showed comparable anti-proliferation effects in HCT-116 and SJSA-1 wild-type p53-expressing cell lines. The isogenic HCT-116 p53-null cells and the osteosarcoma SAOS-2 p53 null cells remained insensitive to NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218 with IC<sub>50</sub>s \u2265 10 \u00b5M. Furthermore, in cell viability assays, using 356 cancer cell lines from the CCLE representative of various tumor types (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barretina et al., 2012</a>), NVP-CFC218 was shown to inhibit proliferation of about 13.2% of the cancer cell lines tested at relevant concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). As expected, 91.5% (43/47) of NVP-CFC218-sensitive cells expressed wild-type p53, consistent with its mechanism of action (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E</a>). Importantly, the sensitivity of 3/4 of these cells bearing mutations in <i>TP53</i> couldn't be reproduced (P12-ICHIKAWA, KBMC-2 and Hs 294T with IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 8 \u00b5M), while the sensitivity of the NCI-H2122 <i>TP53</i> mutant cell line was confirmed in repeat cell proliferation assays. Interestingly, the reported p53 mutations in NCI-H2122 cells (i.e., Q16L and C176F p53) are categorized as being only partially deleterious, suggesting the p53 pathway remains partially functional in these cells. In line with the strong association of p53 mutation with lack of sensitivity to NVP-CFC218, sensitivity response comparison to over 2000 compounds, grouped by their mechanism of action, showed that wild-type p53 cell lines in the CCLE were most sensitive to p53\u2013HDM2 inhibitors, including NVP-CFC218 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>)."

These results indicate that the selection of tumors based only on their p53 mutation status may not be optimal in order to tailor patient selection towards maximal response rate. With the aim to discover more sensitive biomarkers for patient selection, an in vitro predictive model was developed based on the integrative analysis of the genomic features of this panel of 356 cancer cell lines and their association with sensitivity to NVP-CFC218 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barretina et al., 2012</a>). A 13-gene signature was found to be the optimal solution at predicting p53\u2013HDM2 inhibition from gene expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). A further outcome of these studies identified p53 mutation status as being a strong predictor for insensitivity to NVP-CFC218 among about 40,000 input features containing genomic, lineage, and gene expression features, confirming in an unbiased manner the underlying hypothesis for this specific mechanism of action. In addition, a broader set of 215 newly discovered significant features were identified as being correlated to NVP-CFC218 sensitivity. Interestingly, HDM2 expression was found as the second ranked significant feature (after p53 mutation) confirming its correlation with sensitivity to p53\u2013HDM2 inhibitors in an unbiased manner. However, HDM2 amplification was not revealed by the modeling, most likely because of the low representation of HDM2-amplified cell lines in CCLE. Surprisingly, 13/14 of the top most significant expression features corresponded to well-known p53 target genes and their up-regulated expression was found associated with increased sensitivity to NVP-CFC218 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The 14<sup>th</sup> feature, unannotated at the time of this work, was found to be RPL22L1, previously described as having a central role in \u03b1\u03b2 T lymphocytes development, together with its highly homologous paralog RPL22, by up-regulating p53 in a tissue-specific manner (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anderson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). The positive predictive value of this 13-gene signature was found to outperform both the p53 mutation feature alone and the 215 significant feature-set (76% vs 63% and 59%, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Furthermore, comparable performances were found in an additional set of independent cell lines tested for their sensitivity to NVP-CGM097 and NVP-CFC218, validating the predictive power of the 13-gene signature in vitro (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."

Interestingly, the prevalence of the 13-gene signature was found to be quite variable within the multiple lineages tested (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Importantly, however, the lineage-specific proportion of samples scoring positive for the 13-gene signature was strikingly comparable to the proportion of sensitive cell lines to NVP-CFC218, in a given lineage. Furthermore, the application of the signature across a large set of human tumor samples revealed new indications of potential interest for the development of p53\u2013HDM2 inhibitors, such as renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), that had been previously missed due to their under-representation in the set of CCLE cell lines tested. The ability of the 13-gene signature to differentiate signature-positive from signature-negative patient-derived tumor xenografts, allowed testing its in vivo predictive value across a set of these models. In line with the in vitro findings, the 13-gene signature was found to greatly outperform the random response rate to NVP-CGM097 in vivo, independently upon whether the xenograft models were pre-selected or not for their p53 mutation status (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>)."

It has been observed that in proliferating cells, minimal activity of p53 can lead to basal expression of some of its target genes, such as p21 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tang et al., 1998</a>), through mechanisms involving basal promoter-specific recruitment of transcription initiation components (<a href=\"#bib12\">Espinosa and Emerson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Espinosa et al., 2003</a>). In a more recent study from <a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al. (2014)</a>, using Global Run-On sequencing, gene-specific regulatory mechanisms affecting a number of key survival and apoptotic genes within the p53 network were uncovered. The authors imply that some p53 target genes can be \u2018primed\u2019 to be switched on even before the p53 protein is activated, leading to a rapid transcription of these genes following p53 activation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2014</a>). Some of these p53 target genes, such as <i>CDKN1A</i>, <i>HDM2</i>, <i>CCNG1</i>, <i>DDB2</i>, <i>FDXR</i>, <i>BAX</i>, <i>TNFRSF10B</i>, and <i>AEN</i>, were found to be within the top most transcribed genes following Nutlin-3 treatment (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2014</a>) and coincidently are all included in the 13-gene signature described in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. Taking together, these observations strongly suggest that the p53 target gene set contained within the predictive 13-gene signature is representative of an underlying activated p53 pathway that renders cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumor xenografts sensitive to p53\u2013HDM2 inhibitors. Thus, it is reasonable to think that the 13-gene signature discovered here is best at predicting sensitivity to p53\u2013HDM2 inhibitors, since it not only discriminates mutant p53 from wild-type p53 tumors, but also tumors that have an intact p53 gene but a silent p53 pathway from those that are p53 wild-type and bear an activated pathway. We postulate that the latter may be more prone to quickly induce a robust p53-dependent transcriptional response upon exposure to p53\u2013HDM2 inhibitors, thus being more sensitive to this specific anti-cancer therapy."

On these bases, we are currently evaluating the 13-gene signature in a Phase I clinical trial (NCT01760525), in cancer patients bearing p53 wild-type tumors treated with NVP-CGM097."

External diagnosis was independently confirmed by in-house pathologists. The p53 mutation status was determined for each PDX model by both RNA and DNA deep sequencing technologies. Efficacy studies and tumor response were measured as above. The cut-off used for sensitivity to NVP-CGM097 was based on RECIST adapted to tumor volume: models considered to be sensitive either displayed a complete response (full regression) or a partial response (&gt;50% decrease in tumor volume) or a stable disease (between 50% decrease and 35% increase in tumor volume). In vivo models showing a progressive disease (&gt;35% increase in tumor volume) were considered as non-responsive to NVP-CGM097 treatment. The sensitivity call was made at the maximum effect time-point during the treatment period, to avoid a call that could be due, for example, to the appearance of resistance mechanism(s) following treatment with NVP-CGM097."

These efforts lead the authors to identify a 13-gene signature that can predict the cellular response in vitro and in vivo, including patient-derived xenografts, with great accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Remarkably, the gene signature is composed of 13 known direct transcriptional targets of p53 whose expression is strongly elevated in cell lines and tumors prior to MDM2 inhibition. This indicates that the sensitive cell lines harbor a more transcriptionally active form of p53 that 'primes' a fraction of its transcriptional program in proliferating cancer cells. This finding counters the prevalent notion that sensitivity is defined by MDM2 amplification, which would result in very low levels of active p53."

First, we have performed extensive mining of the CCLE using methods such as lasso, ridge regression, elastic net, or SVMs and have generally found similar results across the classification algorithms. To this aim, we employed these methods and found that the majority of the candidate features overlapped with what was found using the Wilcoxon test. Second, the Wilcoxon test is simple and conservative, two appealing properties for our purposes. Third, the method is quite scalable to the type of analysis we wanted to perform, i.e. gradually increasing the number of gene features to set the optimal classification under the most parsimonious set of genes. This analytical approach in combination with na\u00c3\u00afve Bayes probabilistic modeling is a machine learning approach with embedded feature selection, which is in our opinion an appropriate classification strategy."

A likely explanation could come from the Affymetrix GeneChip\u00c2\u00a9 technology together with the RMA summarization method that was used for the gene expression measurements. Such a protocol is known to compress fold changes. Even if a RT-PCR quantification of the transcript expression is expected to reach about 10-20% higher fold changes, this has not been verified on this data set. However, the nanostring quantification of the 13 genes making signature became available in the meantime for most of the cell lines. As expected, the fold changes were found to remain within the same range, even if slightly higher than those from the microarrays. The RMA summarization method is based on the Michigan alternative CDF that summarizes the CEL data at the Entrez gene level. Consequently we did not try to integrate the multi-probe set representations in the analysis to strengthen the differential expression of some genes.

Therefore we did not anticipate that the hematopoietic lineage composition of the sensitive cell line set would interfere with or bias the feature selection or the na\u00c3\u00afve Bayes predictions. Because of the cell line availability, the hematopoietic lineage was also well represented in the testing set (27%), and indeed, many of them proved to be sensitive to both MDM2 inhibitors.
