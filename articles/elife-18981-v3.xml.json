Here we consider the transcriptional \u2018rewiring\u2019 of the three <i>GAL</i> genes that encode the enzymes needed for cells to convert galactose to glucose. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the transcriptional regulator Gal4 binds and activates these genes. In the human pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i> (which last shared a common ancestor with <i>S. cerevisiae</i> some 300 million years ago), we show that different regulators, Rtg1 and Rtg3, activate the three <i>GAL</i> genes. Using single-cell dynamics and RNA-sequencing, we demonstrate that although the overall logic of regulation is the same in both species\u2014the <i>GAL</i> genes are induced by galactose\u2014there are major differences in both the quantitative response of these genes to galactose and in the position of these genes in the overall transcription network structure of the two species."

Here we consider the transcriptional \u2018rewiring\u2019 of the three <i>GAL</i> genes that encode the enzymes needed for cells to convert galactose to glucose. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the transcriptional regulator Gal4 binds and activates these genes. In the human pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i> (which last shared a common ancestor with <i>S. cerevisiae</i> some 300 million years ago), we show that different regulators, Rtg1 and Rtg3, activate the three <i>GAL</i> genes. Using single-cell dynamics and RNA-sequencing, we demonstrate that although the overall logic of regulation is the same in both species\u2014the <i>GAL</i> genes are induced by galactose\u2014there are major differences in both the quantitative response of these genes to galactose and in the position of these genes in the overall transcription network structure of the two species."

In particular, little attention has been paid to the quantitative consequences of transcriptional rewiring. Here we describe an evolutionary analysis of a transcriptional circuit controlling the production of enzymes that convert galactose to glucose-1-phosphate via the Leloir pathway (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kew and Douglas, 1976</a>); these enzymes (a kinase, epimerase and transferase) are conserved across all kingdoms of life (<a href=\"#bib40\">Holden et al., 2003</a>)."

Here the zinc cluster transcriptional regulator Gal4 binds to short sequence motifs in the upstream region of the genes encoding these enzymes (<i>GAL1, GAL7</i> and <i>GAL10</i>) and induces their transcription when galactose is present and glucose is absent. The expression of <i>GAL1</i> has been estimated to be &lt;1 mRNA molecules/10 cells in glucose and ~35 mRNA molecules/cell in galactose (<a href=\"#bib44\">Iyer and Struhl, 1996</a>).

It also contains a clear ortholog of the transcriptional regulator Gal4 (<a href=\"#bib62\">Martchenko et al., 2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Sellam et al., 2010</a>). However, in <i>C. albicans</i>, which last shared a common ancestor with <i>S. cerevisiae</i> at\u00a0least 300 million years ago (<a href=\"#bib93\">Taylor and Berbee, 2006</a>), Gal4 does not play a role in expressing the three <i>GAL</i> enzymes (<a href=\"#bib61\">Martchenko et al., 2007a</a>); instead, it has been implicated as having a subsidiary role in regulating glucose utilization (<a href=\"#bib5\">Askew et al., 2009</a>). Despite being uncoupled from Gal4, the three <i>GAL</i> genes in <i>C. albicans</i> are transcriptionally activated when galactose is present and glucose is absent in the growth medium (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brown et al., 2009</a>). While a few fungal species have lost the <i>GAL1, GAL7</i>, and <i>GAL10</i> gene cluster entirely, most have retained it, including several pathogenic species closely related to <i>C. albicans</i> such as <i>C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis</i> and <i>C. parapsilosis</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fitzpatrick et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hittinger et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Slot and Rokas, 2010</a>). Since the only known environmental niche for <i>C. albicans</i> is in or on warm-blooded animals (<a href=\"#bib74\">Odds, 1988</a>), it seems very likely that the three <i>GAL</i> genes and their regulation is important for the ability of <i>C. albicans</i> to survive in its host."

To identify this protein, we utilized a collection of transcription factor knockout strains in <i>C. albicans</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fox et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Homann et al., 2009</a>) and assayed them for growth defects on media containing Antimycin A (to prevent respiration) and galactose as the only sugar. We screened 212 knockout strains and found only two, \u25b3/\u25b3rtg1 and \u25b3/\u25b3rtg3, that grew several orders of magnitude slower than the parent strain under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This response is specific to galactose as these cells grow at normal levels on glucose, even in the presence of Antimycin A (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

We inserted two copies of a consensus Rtg1-Rtg3 motif (derived from the upstream regions of the three <i>C. albicans GAL</i> genes, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) into a truncated <i>CYC1</i> promoter driving GFP and measured gene expression in cells grown in glucose and galactose.

We note that the Rtg1-Rtg3 motifs, although sufficient for induction by galactose, do not completely recapitulate the behavior of the natural p<i>GAL1</i> promoter; in particular, the Rtg1-Rtg3 motif construct was not repressed in the presence of glucose. This observation indicates that additional <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences present in the natural <i>GAL1</i> promoter are needed for glucose repression. Taken together, the results of the genetic screen, the similarity of the <i>C. albicans GAL</i> gene <i>cis</i> regulatory element to the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Rtg1-Rtg3 binding site, the ChIP experiment in <i>C. albicans,</i> and the reporter expression experiments show that Rtg1 and Rtg3 are responsible for the galactose-inducible expression of the three <i>C. albicans GAL</i> genes by binding directly to the <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences located upstream of the genes."

As indicated by the black wedges, galactose concentration increases left to right while glucose concentration increases from top to bottom. Red dots in each plot indicate <i>C. albicans GAL1</i> expression while green dots indicate <i>S. cerevisiae GAL1</i> expression. The y-axis on each plot is fluorescence, normalized by side scatter, and it spans three orders of magnitude. The\u00a0data was\u00a0collected every 20 min for 10\u2009hr.

                                "text": "These experiments confirm that, despite the evolutionary wiring change, the basic logic of the galactose circuit is preserved between <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae: GAL1</i> expression increases in galactose and decreases in glucose (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). However, there are several obvious differences in the quantitative behaviors of the two circuits. (1) The dynamic range of activation (ON vs OFF) is much larger in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (~900 fold) than in <i>C. albicans</i> (~12 fold, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Two factors contribute to this difference: the basal expression of <i>GAL1</i> (expression in the presence of glucose and absence of galactose) is higher in <i>C. albicans</i>, and the maximum expression level in <i>C. albicans</i> (in the presence of galactose and absence of glucose) is lower than in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. (2) In the absence of glucose, <i>GAL1</i> begins its induction 20\u201340 min faster in <i>C. albicans</i> than in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These conclusions are based the first derivative of fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and rely on the assumption that the rates of GFP folding in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>C. albicans</i> do not vary sufficiently to account for these differences. (3) The third major difference in the <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> response is the concentration of galactose needed for half-maximal activation of <i>GAL1;</i> it is ~15 fold lower in <i>C. albicans</i> than in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), consistent with previous observations that <i>C. albicans</i> is able to respond to very low concentrations of sugar (<a href=\"#bib83\">Rodaki et al., 2009</a>). (4) The opposite behavior is observed in the sensitivity of each species to glucose. In the presence of saturating concentrations of galactose, half-maximal repression by glucose occurs at lower levels in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> than in <i>C. albicans</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). (5) A key property of the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> network is bimodal expression of p<i>GAL1</i>; that is, at intermediate levels of galactose and glucose, the population consists of mixtures of fully ON and fully OFF cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Biggar and Crabtree, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Venturelli et al., 2015</a>). No bimodality is evident in <i>C. albicans</i> across a large range of glucose and galactose ratios (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Instead, the <i>C. albicans</i> response appears graded; that is, at intermediate concentrations of glucose and galactose, individual cells produced intermediate levels of GFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

Several groups have shown that the expression dynamics of <i>GAL1</i>, specifically its potent induction and bimodality, is conserved across many isolates of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib73\">Nogi, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Wang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Warringer et al., 2011</a>), including W303, the strain used in our analysis (<a href=\"#bib81\">Ralser et al., 2012</a>). To determine whether different <i>C. albicans</i> isolates vary in their response to galactose, we measured <i>GAL1</i> expression dynamics using 11 different patient isolates of <i>C. albicans,</i> all from different clades (<a href=\"#bib9\">Blignaut et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Lockhart et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Odds et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Pujol et al., 2002</a>), and including strains isolated from different anatomical sites of infection and different parts of the world (<a href=\"#bib4\">Angebault et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hirakawa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Odds et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Shin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib107\">Wu et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Each isolate was engineered so that the <i>GAL1</i> promoter was fused to GFP; the isolates were then analyzed across a wide range of galactose concentrations with a mCherry-marked SC5314 strain of <i>C. albicans</i> as a control (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We observed that, despite some small differences (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), the qualitative and quantitative aspects of <i>GAL1</i> induction were similar across all 12 isolates, including SC5314, the lab strain used for most of our experiments (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). None of the five differences documented between <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>C. albicans</i> were observed between any two <i>C. albicans</i> isolates (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We conclude from these experiments that the transcriptional response of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>C. albicans</i> to galactose\u2014although similar in overall logic\u2014differ in almost all of their quantitative output features. Moreover, these differences are characteristic of each species as a whole and not of a particular isolate."

In <i>C. albicans</i> [which lacks a <i>GAL2</i> ortholog (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brown et al, 2009</a>)]<i>, GAL1, GAL7</i> and <i>GAL10</i> were all induced by galactose, but to a much lesser extent than in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, nearly all (28/30) genes besides <i>GAL1, GAL7, GAL10</i> and <i>GAL2</i> are induced by galactose, but to a much lesser extent (at least two-fold but less than 30-fold in two independent experiments, with p-values &lt;0.01). Most of these 30 genes are involved in some aspect of carbohydrate metabolism (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cherry et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). In <i>C. albicans</i>, 33 genes met the same criteria for being galactose-induced, yet none of them showed the higher levels of induction characteristic of <i>S. cerevisiae GAL</i> genes; the majority were induced between two-fold and 13-fold. These genes are annotated as being involved in pathogenesis, biofilm formation, filamentous growth, as well as carbohydrate metabolism (<a href=\"#bib43\">Inglis et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Except for the <i>GAL1, GAL7</i> and <i>GAL10</i> genes, there was little overlap (only 2 additional genes, <i>RHR2</i> and <i>PFK27,</i> annotated in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> as enzymes involved in sugar metabolism) between the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>C. albicans</i> galactose-induced genes (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Indeed, many of the galactose-induced genes in <i>C. albicans</i> did not have an identifiable ortholog in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and vice-versa (<a href=\"#bib13\">Byrne and Wolfe, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fitzpatrick et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Maguire et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These observations indicate that the wiring change between <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>C. albicans</i> maintained the galactose induction of <i>GAL1, GAL7</i>, and <i>GAL10</i> but changed the remaining genes in the galactose-induced regulon."

Consistent with this idea, the <i>C. albicans GAL</i> genes were observed, in a genome-wide study, to be induced in response to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), a sugar derivative also known to induce genes involved in pathogenesis, biofilm formation and filamentous growth (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gunasekera et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Kamthan et al., 2013</a>). To further examine this observation, we measured the expression of the <i>GAL1</i> promoter fusion in both <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> in response to GlcNAc and observed that GlcNAc induced expression of the <i>GAL</i> genes in <i>C. albicans</i>, but not <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Moreover, this induction is also observed in our test construct, which contained two Rtg1-Rtg3 binding sites driving expression of a heterologous promoter (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The observed GlcNAc induction of both the artificial constructs and the natural <i>GAL1</i> promoter requires Rtg1-Rtg3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>).

These enzymes and their functions are conserved across all kingdoms of life; direct evidence shows this is the case for many fungal species including <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Dudley et al., 2005</a>), <i>K. lactis</i> (<a href=\"#bib85\">Rubio-Texeira, 2005</a>), <i>C. albicans</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Martchenko et al., 2007a</a>, this paper) and <i>Y. lipolytica</i> (<a href=\"#bib52\">Lazar et al., 2015</a>). These enzymes have a deeply conserved function (conversion of galactose to glucose-1 phosphate) and a deeply conserved pattern of regulation: their expression increases when galactose is added to the growth medium. However, a shift in the mechanism of galactose induction occurred along the evolutionary pathway to <i>S. cerevisiae</i> resulting in Gal4 'replacing' Rtg1-Rtg3 as an inducer of the <i>GAL</i> genes in response to galactose.

We documented five important differences between the <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> galactose responses. (1) The basal level of <i>GAL</i> gene expression is higher in <i>C. albicans</i> and the maximal induced level is lower resulting in a significantly lower induction ratio (~12-fold) in <i>C. albicans</i> compared with <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (~900-fold). (2) Induction occurs 20\u201340 min faster in <i>C. albicans</i> than in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, with the exact difference dependent on the medium composition. (3) The concentration of galactose required for half maximal induction of <i>GAL1</i> is 15-fold lower in <i>C. albicans</i> (0.002%) than <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (0.03%). (4) The concentration of glucose required for half-maximal repression is at least two-fold lower in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> than in <i>C. albicans</i>. (5) The well-documented bimodality observed at certain ratios of glucose:galactose in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> appears absent in <i>C. albicans</i> over a wide range of glucose and galactose concentrations; thus, instead of an all-or-none response, <i>C. albicans</i> exhibits a much more graded expression. We showed that these characteristics were true for 11 different clinical isolates of <i>C. albicans</i>, demonstrating that these behaviors are characteristic of the species as whole rather than a particular isolate. Full genome analysis revealed three additional, qualitative differences between regulation of the <i>GAL</i> genes in <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. (6) In <i>C. albicans</i>, the galactose regulon (33 genes induced by galactose) includes, in addition to the <i>GAL</i> genes, genes implicated in several aspects of pathogenesis. In contrast, the galactose regulon of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> functions almost exclusively in galactose regulation, metabolism and transport. Other than <i>GAL1, GAL7</i> and <i>GAL10</i>, there is virtually no overlap (only two genes) between the galactose-induced regulon in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>C. albicans</i>. (7) The galactose regulon of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> consists of two major tiers of regulation: Four <i>GAL</i> genes that are induced nearly 1000 fold in response to galactose and 28 genes that are induced to a much lesser extent (2 to 30 fold, <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). In <i>C. albicans</i>, 33 genes that are induced by galactose all show modest induction (31 are induced 2 to 13 fold while the other 2 are induced 20 and 50 fold, respectively). (8) In <i>C. albicans</i>, the <i>GAL</i> genes (and the rest of the regulon) can be induced by signals other than galactose."

The moderate induction by galactose of the <i>GAL</i> genes in <i>C. albicans</i> is recapitulated when Rtg1-Rtg3 <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences are added to a test promoter.

In contrast, the features of <i>C. albicans</i> (high basal levels and lower induction of <i>GAL</i> gene expression, higher sensitivity to galactose, and the inclusion of the <i>GAL</i> genes in a regulon that includes genes needed for pathogenesis) may be important for <i>C. albicans</i> to thrive in niches of warm-blooded animals where galactose is probably present at very low concentrations (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gibson et al., 1996</a>). For example, in many mammals, galactose is synthesized and incorporated into glycolipids and glycoproteins; it is ingested through diet, for example, through the hydrolysis of lactose into glucose and galactose. Consistent with these ideas, we know that the Rtg1-Rtg3 circuit is central to the ability of <i>C. albicans</i> to proliferate in a mammalian host, as <i>C. albicans</i> mutants deleted for <i>RTG1</i> and <i>RTG3</i> are deficient in several mouse models of infection (<a href=\"#bib80\">P\u00e9rez et al., 2013</a>).

This 'proxy' idea might also explain why other sugars also induce this regulon in <i>C. albicans</i>. A second possibility is that galactose is utilized differently in <i>C. albicans</i> than in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>; rather than simply converting galactose to glucose-1 phosphate, <i>C. albicans</i> may use endogenous galactose (or metabolites derived from galactose) in ways that require the induction of other genes."

For this model, specific-pathogen-free female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 400 grams (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_5508397\">RGD_5508397</a>) were used. A heparinized (100 Units/ml) polyethylene catheter with 0.76\u2009mm inner and 1.52\u2009mm outer diameters was inserted into the external jugular vein and advanced to a site above the right atrium. The catheter was secured to the vein with the proximal end tunneled subcutaneously to the midscapular space and externalized through the skin. The catheters were inserted 24\u2009hr prior to infection to permit a conditioning period for deposition of host protein on the catheter surface. Infection was achieved by intraluminal instillation of 500\u2009\u03bcl <i>C. albicans</i> cells (10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml). After a 4\u2009hr dwelling period, the catheter volume was withdrawn and the catheter flushed with heparinized 0.15\u2009M NaCl. Catheters were removed after 24\u2009hr of <i>C. albicans</i> infection to assay biofilm development on the intraluminal surface by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Catheter segments were washed with 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde/4% formaldehyde, washed again with phosphate buffer for 5\u2009min, and placed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 30 min. The samples were dehydrated in a series of 10\u2009min ethanol washes (30%, 50%, 70%, 85%, 95%, and 100%), followed by critical point drying. Specimens were mounted on aluminum stubs, sputter coated with gold, and imaged using a Hitachi S-5700 or JEOL JSM- 6100 scanning electron microscope in the high-vacuum mode at 10 kV. Images were assembled using Adobe Photoshop Version 7.0.1 software. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Wisconsin (protocol MV1947) according to the guidelines of the Animal Welfare Act, and The Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and Public Health Service Policy."

The authors provide a compelling and detailed example of how the GALactose utilization network of the pathogenic yeast <i>Candida albicans</i> differs from the well-characterized eukaryotic model network in the baker's yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Although differences between the regulation of these two networks were first characterized in 2007 by another lab (PMID: 17540568), it appears that the original paper may have only correctly identified half of the events. Specifically, the original study and the present study make it clear that the transcriptional activator Gal4 (and here also the co-repressor Gal80) do not regulate the GAL genes in <i>C. albicans</i>. In addition to showing that Gal4 regulated non-GAL targets in <i>C. albicans</i>, the original study identified Cph1 (the ortholog of Ste12) as the transcriptional activator of the GAL genes. In contrast, the present study identified Rtg1 and Rtg3 as GAL regulators by screening a library of transcription factor knockouts for genes whose removal eliminated galactose catabolism (in the presence of the respiration inhibitor Antimycin A). Both rtg1 and rtg3 deletions had strong phenotypic effects in this condition, while cph1 and gal4 deletions did not. Induction of a GAL1 reporter construct and a synthetic promoter containing Rtg1 and Rtg3 binding sites were shown to depend on functional RTG1 and/or RTG3. The present study also provides a much more thorough, precise, and quantitative characterization of the induction parameters of the <i>C. albicans</i> network than previous semi-quantitative studies published in 2007-2010 (which are properly cited here). Finally, by creating a rtg1 knockout in the early-diverging <i>Saccharomycotina Yarrowia lipolytica</i>, they provide evidence that Rtg1-mediated regulation of the GAL network is ancestral (although the quantitative effect of deletion is only 3-fold)."

It may have interesting implications for how the downstream regulators switched, nicely setting the stage for future studies. Similarly, the result that GlcNAc may regulate galactose metabolism is thought provoking and will likely to be extended in future work.

Here, the <i>C. albicans</i> GAL1/7/10 genes are shown to be necessary for growth on galactose and to be important for formation of robust biofilms in a rat catheter model.

(Current Biology, 2007) state that their data \u201csuggests\u201d a role of CPH1 in regulating the GAL genes in <i>C. albicans</i>; this is not a hard conclusion. The suggestion is based on two experiments: (1) a \u201cCPH1-like\u201d cis-regulatory sequence was identified in the GAL promoters; when deleted in the GAL10 promoter, the expression of a GAL10 reporter was reduced. Our data agree with this; the Rtg1-3 site we identified overlaps with the \u201cCPH1-like\u201d cis regulatory sequence identified by Martchenko et al. Hence, the Martchenko et al. deletion result is fully consistent with Rtg1-Rtg3 being the primary regulators of the GAL genes. (2) In a CPH1 deletion strain, expression of the GAL10 reporter gene was reduced. We note that this could be an indirect effect\u2013no direct binding of CPH1 to the GAL genes was reported. In our hands, a freshly-made CPH1 deletion strain, in comparison with a genetically matched parental strain, showed no reduction in GAL1 expression (data not shown) and no growth phenotype on media that required galactose metabolism (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Its reach will be extended because of the iconic status of the GAL network in molecular biology and because of previous evolutionary studies on this network. I found the inference (based on reporter gene expression in knockouts) that Gal1 may still play a signaling role that does not involve Gal4 and Gal80 particularly surprising. It may have interesting implications for how the downstream regulators switched, nicely setting the stage for future studies. Similarly, the result that GlcNAc may regulate galactose metabolism is thought provoking and will likely to be extended in future work.
