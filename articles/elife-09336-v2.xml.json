                    "text": "In eukaryotes, exposure to hypertonic conditions activates a MAPK (Hog1 in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and ortholog p38 in human cells). In yeast, intracellular glycerol accumulates to counterbalance the high external osmolarity. To prevent glycerol efflux, Hog1 action impedes the function of the aquaglyceroporin Fps1, in part, by displacing channel co-activators (Rgc1/2). However, Fps1 closes upon hyperosmotic shock even in <i>hog1</i>\u2206 cells, indicating another mechanism to prevent Fps1-mediated glycerol efflux. In our prior proteome-wide screen, Fps1 was identified as a target of TORC2-dependent protein kinase Ypk1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Muir et al., 2014</a>). We show here that Fps1 is an authentic Ypk1 substrate and that the open channel state of Fps1 requires phosphorylation by Ypk1. Moreover, hyperosmotic conditions block TORC2-dependent Ypk1-mediated Fps1 phosphorylation, causing channel closure, glycerol accumulation, and enhanced survival under hyperosmotic stress. These events are all Hog1-independent. Our findings define the underlying molecular basis of a new mechanism for responding to hypertonic conditions."

                    "text": "In eukaryotes, exposure to hypertonic conditions activates a MAPK (Hog1 in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and ortholog p38 in human cells). In yeast, intracellular glycerol accumulates to counterbalance the high external osmolarity. To prevent glycerol efflux, Hog1 action impedes the function of the aquaglyceroporin Fps1, in part, by displacing channel co-activators (Rgc1/2). However, Fps1 closes upon hyperosmotic shock even in <i>hog1</i>\u2206 cells, indicating another mechanism to prevent Fps1-mediated glycerol efflux. In our prior proteome-wide screen, Fps1 was identified as a target of TORC2-dependent protein kinase Ypk1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Muir et al., 2014</a>). We show here that Fps1 is an authentic Ypk1 substrate and that the open channel state of Fps1 requires phosphorylation by Ypk1. Moreover, hyperosmotic conditions block TORC2-dependent Ypk1-mediated Fps1 phosphorylation, causing channel closure, glycerol accumulation, and enhanced survival under hyperosmotic stress. These events are all Hog1-independent. Our findings define the underlying molecular basis of a new mechanism for responding to hypertonic conditions."

Among other potential targets, our screen pinpointed two proteins involved in glycerol metabolism, aquaglyceroporin Fps1 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Luyten et al., 1995</a>) and Gpt2/Gat1, an enzyme that converts glycerol-3P to phosphatidic acid (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zheng and Zou, 2001</a>), a precursor to other phospholipids and triacylglycerol (<a href=\"#bib16\">Henry et al., 2012</a>). Both candidates warranted further investigation because, as we showed, Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation inhibits another enzyme in glycerol metabolism, Gpd1, which generates glycerol-3P (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2012</a>), and <i>GPD1</i> expression is highly induced by hyperosmotic stress (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albertyn et al., 1994b</a>). Second, accumulation of intercellular glycerol is essential for yeast cell survival under hyperosmotic conditions (<a href=\"#bib42\">Westfall et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Saito and Posas, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hohmann, 2015</a>).

Although both CN-deficient and <i>hog1\u2206</i> cells are quite sensitive to the ionic imbalances caused by high salt (e.g., 1 M NaCl), <i>hog1\u2206</i> cells are significantly more sensitive to hypertonic stress per se, such as a high concentration of an uncharged impermeant osmolyte (e.g., 1 M sorbitol)."

At such sites, Ser residues just penultimate to the canonical one (in red) can be phosphorylated in a Ypk1-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib34\">Roelants et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, we generated a Gpt2(S649A S650A S651A) mutant. One or more of these three Ser residues is phosphorylated in vivo because, compared to wild-type, Gpt2<sup>3A</sup> exhibited a distinctly faster mobility upon SDS-PAGE, a hallmark of decreased phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), just like wild-type Gpt2 treated with phosphatase (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, this phosphorylation did not appear to be dependent on Ypk1 because little change occurred in Gpt2 mobility when an analog-sensitive <i>ypk1-as ypk2\u0394</i> strain was treated with the cognate inhibitor (3-MB-PP1) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

                        "text": "A remaining question is how hyperosmotic stress causes such a rapid and profound reduction in phosphorylation of Ypk1 at its TORC2 sites. This outcome could arise from activation of a phosphatase (other than CN), inhibition of TORC2 catalytic activity, or both. Despite a recent report that Tor2 (the catalytic component of TORC2) interacts physically with Sho1 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lam et al., 2015</a>), raising the possibility that a Hog1 pathway sensor directly modulates TORC2 activity, we found that hyperosmolarity inactivates TORC2 just as robustly in <i>sho1\u0394</i> cells as in wild-type cells. Alternatively, given the role ascribed to the ancillary TORC2 subunits Slm1 and Slm2 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gaubitz et al., 2015</a>) in delivering Ypk1 to the TORC2 complex (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berchtold et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Niles et al., 2012</a>), response to hyperosmotic shock might be mediated by some influence on Slm1 and Slm2. Thus, although the mechanism that abrogates TORC2 phosphorylation of Ypk1 upon hypertonic stress remains to be delineated, this effect and its consequences represent a novel mechanism for sensing and responding to hyperosmolarity."

In addition, and importantly, the authors show that in wild-type cells, under hyperosmotic stress conditions, TORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Fps1 by Ypk1 is blocked. They show that this results in closure of the Fps1 channel for glycerol efflux, resulting in glycerol accumulation during hyperosmotic stress, which in turn leads to increased cell survival under these conditions."

There are only two known conditions under which <i>slm1\u2206slm2\u2206</i> cells are viable and in which, <i>theoretically</i>, we could ask whether or not 1 M sorbitol is still able to cause a drop in TORC2-mediated phosphorylation of Ypk1 when the Slm1 and Slm2 proteins are absent."

(2004) EMBO J<i>.</i> 23: 3747 -3757]. <i>SAC7</i> encodes a primary GAP for yeast Rho1 and, as shown in collaborative work by Yoshi Ohya and David Levin [Kamada Y et al. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271: 9193-9196], Rho1 is the activator of yeast Pkc1 [misnamed because it really is more related to the mammalian Rho- (and Rac-) activated PKR2/PKN\u03b3; see Vincent S, Settleman J (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol<i>.</i> 17: 2247-2256; Mukai H (2003<i>) J. Biochem. (Tokyo)</i> 133: 17-27]. In any event, loss of Sac7 up-regulates Pkc1 signaling and, as we demonstrated before [Roelants FM et al<i>.</i> (2002) Mol. Biol. Cell 13: 3005 -3028], any perturbation that up-regulates Pkc1 function bypasses the inviability of cells deficient in Ypk1 and Ypk2 signaling, presumably because some aspects of the cell wall integrity pathway act in parallel or are semi-redundant with functions normally controlled by Ypk1 and Ypk2. The problem arises, however, from observations reported by Ted Powers lab [Niles BJ et al. (2012) PNAS 109: 1536\u20131541]. They examined the state of Ypk1 phosphorylation in <i>slm1\u2206slm2\u2206sac7\u2206</i> triple mutant and found that Ypk1 phosphorylation at both its activation loop (T504) and at one of its critical TORC2 sites (T662), as judged for the latter using a phospho-site-specific antibody they themselves generated, were greatly reduced. Thus, because TORC2- mediated phosphorylation is already way down in this background, it would be very challenging and probably not meaningful to examine whether the level of T662 phosphorylation goes down further in response to challenge with 1 M sorbitol."

(2011) PNAS 108: 19222-19227] or <i>avo3\u2206</i> cells, which are deficient in TORC2 activity [Niles, op. cit.]. However, the same problem arises here too because, as judged by using exactly the same antibody (generously provided by Ted Powers), we have found that T662 phosphorylation is virtually undetectable on Ypk1(D242A) in <i>slm1\u2206slm2\u2206</i> cells (K.

Slm1 and Slm2 were identified originally as PP2B/calcineurin-binding proteins nearly contemporaneously in three different labs [Bultynck G et al. (2006) Mol. Cell. Biol. 26: 4729-4745; Tabuchi M et al. (2006) Mol. Cell. Biol<i>.</i> 26 : 5861 -5875; Daquinag A et al. (2007) Mol. Cell. Biol<i>.</i> 27: 633-650]. Hence, in the absence of Slm1 and Slm2, there will be a lack of proper sequestration of PP2B. Thus, the low level of Ypk1 phosphorylation observed when Slm1 and Slm2 are absent could arise, potentially, from an enhanced rate of dephosphorylation of Ypk1 itself or of some site in a component of TORC2 critical for its activity on Ypk1, or both. Alternatively, because Slm1 and Slm2 contain lipid-binding PH domains near their C-terminus [Yu JW et al. (2004) Mol. Cell 13 : 677-688; Gallego O et al. (2010) Mol. Syst. Biol<i>.</i> 6: 430.1-430.15] and both are considered subunits of TORC2 [Gaubitz C et al. (2015) Mol. Cell 58: 977- 988] it is possible that, in the absence of Slm1 and Slm2, inefficient or improper membrane tethering of TORC2 is responsible for the reduction in Ypk1 phosphorylation observed in <i>slm1\u2206slm2\u2206</i> cells. Neither we nor any other yeast researcher has yet adequately resolved these issues. Nonetheless, as requested by Reviewer #2, we have added a sentence to the Discussion pointing out that it is possible that the response to hyperosmotic shock might be mediated by some influence on the Slm1 and Slm2 proteins, and we cite the Berchtold et al. reference in this context (although the Berchtold paper was already cited in our original manuscript)."
