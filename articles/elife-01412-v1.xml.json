In the absence of sodium, changes in pH had no major effect. By contrast, changes in Na<sup>+</sup> concentration caused a marked conformational change that was largely pH-independent. Crystallographically determined, apparent dissociation constants indicated \u223c10-fold stronger Na<sup>+</sup> binding at pH 8 than at pH 4, consistent with substrate competition for a common ion-binding site. Projection difference maps indicated helix movements by about 2 \u00c5 in the 6-helix bundle region of MjNhaP1 that is thought to contain the ion translocation site. We propose that these movements convert the antiporter from the proton-bound, outward-open state to the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound, inward-open state. Oscillation between the two states would result in rapid Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport."

In the absence of sodium, changes in pH had no major effect. By contrast, changes in Na<sup>+</sup> concentration caused a marked conformational change that was largely pH-independent. Crystallographically determined, apparent dissociation constants indicated \u223c10-fold stronger Na<sup>+</sup> binding at pH 8 than at pH 4, consistent with substrate competition for a common ion-binding site. Projection difference maps indicated helix movements by about 2 \u00c5 in the 6-helix bundle region of MjNhaP1 that is thought to contain the ion translocation site. We propose that these movements convert the antiporter from the proton-bound, outward-open state to the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound, inward-open state. Oscillation between the two states would result in rapid Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport."

In humans, Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter dysfunction is associated with numerous serious or life-threatening diseases (<a href=\"#bib10\">Donowitz et al., 2013</a>), which makes them important drug targets (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fliegel, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boedtkjer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Loo et al., 2012</a>). Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters belong to the superfamily of cation/proton antiporters (CPA), which include the CPA1 and CPA2 subfamilies as main branches (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brett et al., 2005</a>). CPA1 transporters are electroneutral and most likely exchange protons and Na<sup>+</sup> ions with a 1:1 stoichiometry, whereas CPA2 transporters, which mostly exchange two protons per Na<sup>+</sup>, are electrogenic. The best-known member of the CPA2 subfamily is the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter NhaA from <i>E. coli</i>. EcNhaA enables <i>E. coli</i> to survive at high salinity or alkaline pH (<a href=\"#bib30\">Padan and Schuldiner, 1994</a>), making use of the proton-motive force to extrude sodium from the cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Other members of the CPA2 subfamily include the plant CHX transporters and the mammalian NHA transporters. Well-known representatives of the CPA1 subfamily include the medically important mammalian NHE exchangers and the archaeal NhaP antiporters (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brett et al., 2005</a>)."

For EcNhaA, a maximum transport rate of 10<sup>5</sup> min<sup>\u22121</sup> at pH 8.5 has been reported, which drops by two or three orders of magnitude at pH 6.5 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Taglicht et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Rimon et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Padan, 2008</a>). This pH dependence has been attributed to a putative cytoplasmic pH sensor, which transfers the antiporter into an acidic-locked conformation at low pH (<a href=\"#bib35\">Taglicht et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Padan, 2008</a>). A recent study of \u0394pH and \u0394Na<sup>+</sup>-driven transport indicated a symmetrical bell-shaped pH dependence of EcNhaA (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mager et al., 2011</a>). Transport activity was maximal at pH 8.5, and more than doubled as the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration increased from 10 mM to 100 mM. These observations are consistent with a simple kinetic model whereby H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> compete for the same substrate binding site (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mager et al., 2011</a>), thought to include two conserved aspartates in TMH V of EcNhaA. According to this model, inactivation at low pH occurs because Na<sup>+</sup> ions cannot compete effectively against protons for the binding site. Inactivation at high pH is simply due to the depletion of H<sup>+</sup> substrate ions at the binding site, as the proton concentration becomes too low to drive transport."

The map revealed 12 transmembrane \u03b1-helices (TMHs) per protomer, referred to as TMH I-XII. The TMHs of EcNhaA were arranged in two groups: a 6-helix bundle at the tip of each protomer, and a row of 6 helices at the dimer interface. The 3.45 \u00c5 X-ray structure of monomeric EcNhaA in an inward-open conformation provided further details, including a pair of discontinuous helices (TMH IV and XI) in the 6-helix bundle that were proposed to harbor the ion translocation site (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hunte et al., 2005</a>). By electron crystallography we obtained a projection structure (<a href=\"#bib37\">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</a>) and, more recently, a 3D map of the MjNhaP1 dimer in the membrane at 7 \u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#bib14\">Goswami et al., 2011</a>) that indicated 13 TMHs, referred to as TMHs 1-13.

TtNapA is electrogenic, and thus functionally similar to EcNhaA. However, in terms of protein structure, it resembles MjNhaP1 much more closely, as judged from a 6 \u00c5 projection map we calculated from the TtNapA coordinates (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This refers in particular to the position of the 6-helix bundle relative to the dimer interface and the number of TMHs (13 in TtNapA and MjNhaP1, only 12 in EcNhaA). Nevertheless, Lee et al. assume that the structures of TtNapA and EcNhaA show the outward-open and inward-open conformation of essentially the same antiporter. A model of TtNapA in the inward-open conformation based on the EcNhaA structure was generated, and compared it to the outward-open TtNapA structure. Not surprisingly, there were major differences between the inward-open model and the outward-open structure, in particular with respect to the position and orientation of the 6-helix bundle, which appeared to rotate by 20\u00b0 within the membrane. On the basis of this comparison, they proposed a transport mechanism, which was claimed to apply to all Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters. However, such a massive domain movement is difficult to reconcile with the high turnover rates of EcNhaA and the comparatively subtle substrate-induced changes in and around the 6-helix bundle we observe experimentally in MjNhaP1."

The latter shows the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound state, whereas the former shows the apo or proton-bound state of the antiporter. At elevated Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations, the pH 6 maps resemble those at pH 4 or 8, but the difference peaks are less distinct and only roughly half as strong, as would be expected if the corresponding helices were disordered. We ascribe this apparent disorder to the fact that the antiporter is fully active at pH 6, and the helices involved in ion translocation would oscillate between the sodium-free and sodium-bound state. Hence, when the 2D crystals are frozen in liquid nitrogen, the helices are trapped in a continuum of slightly different orientations.

Down-regulation at acidic pH has not yet been shown experimentally (largely because there is no suitable pH-sensitive fluorescent dye), but follows from physiological considerations, which indicate that the antiporter must be inactive at pH 4 to prevent uncontrolled influx of Na<sup>+</sup> ions that would otherwise result from a large outward pH gradient (<a href=\"#bib37\">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</a>). A shutdown at acidic and basic conditions is a key feature of the simple kinetic model proposed by Mager et al. for EcNhaA. This model thus also appears to hold for MjNhaP1. At pH 4, this antiporter may be down-regulated due to competition of H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> for a common binding site, and at pH 8 due to proton depletion. Together with the activity peak around pH 6, these two effects would result in a bell-shaped pH dependence of transport activity."

However, if Na<sup>+</sup> can displace H<sup>+</sup> and can arrest the antiporter in a Na<sup>+</sup>-bound state at pH 4, the question arises why this does not also happen at pH 6, where the antiporter is fully active. Apparently, in addition to substrate competition, the transport rate of MjNhaP1 is also modulated in some other way, for example by the protonation states of amino acid sidechains involved in ion-binding and translocation that render the antiporter more flexible at pH 6 than at pH 4 or pH 8. In EcNhaA and NHE1, a pH sensor is thought to transform the antiporters from an active into an acid-locked state at low pH (<a href=\"#bib5\">Aronson et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Aronson, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Taglicht et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Wakabayashi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Padan et al., 2009</a>).

The crystals had been grown in the presence of NaCl, and therefore incubating them in salt-free buffers changed both the pH and the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration simultaneously. The effect observed by Vinothkumar et al. was thus due to both Na<sup>+</sup> and pH, rather than to pH only. We were able to reproduce these differences with 2D crystals grown with or without NaCl, as indicated in <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>."

Projection difference maps at 6 \u00c5 resolution show that pH in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> has no major effect on the structure of the antiporter. This contrasts with current models of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter regulation, which postulate a significant pH-triggered conformational switch. If such a pH switch occurs in MjNhaP1, it does not affect the secondary structure but may involve sidechain movements, which are not resolved by our method. On the other hand, Na<sup>+</sup> ions cause a marked conformational change that is largely pH-independent."

This enabled us to deduce apparent binding constants of MjNhaP1 for Na<sup>+</sup> under acidic and basic conditions. At pH 6, where this antiporter is fully active, the helices involved in ion translocation appear disordered, due to averaging over many slightly different conformations on the crystal lattice."

In the apo or proton-bound state, the ion-binding site near the center of TMH 6 would be accessible from the extracellular side, making this the outward-open state. The helix movements brought about by Na<sup>+</sup> ions then convert the antiporter into the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound, inward-open state. Oscillation between the two states would result in Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport, as specified by the alternating access mechanism (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jardetzky, 1966</a>). It is likely that the mammalian NHE antiporters, which share many similarities with the archaeal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers, work in the same way."

To account for small differences in unit cell length, maps were excised (fft, mapmask, maprot, and npo) and placed into the same cell before subtraction. For an estimate of background noise level, image data collected under identical conditions were randomly divided into two sets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> first column), or image data from different conditions were mixed and randomly merged into two separate data sets. These control difference maps were plotted with a stepsize of 1.5 \u03c3 between contour levels, indicating a background level of \u00b12 contour levels, or \u223c3 \u03c3. The background level was set to be the same in all calculated difference maps by applying the same absolute plotting parameters as used for the control difference maps (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3\u20135</a>)."

We ascribe this apparent disorder to the fact that at pH 6, where the antiporter is maximally active, the helices involved in ion translocation move rapidly and are trapped in a continuum of slightly different orientations when the 2D crystals are frozen in liquid nitrogen. In a projection map, which takes the average of all molecules on the 2D crystal lattice, the helices would then appear disordered, as observed. This is now discussed in the section \u2018pH dependence of sodium binding in MjNhaP1\u2019 of the revised manuscript. Under these conditions, the height of difference peaks is not a direct measure of Na<sup>+</sup> affinity, so that we cannot deduce an apparent binding constant from the difference peaks at pH 6.

We (<a href=\"#bib14\">Goswami et al., 2011</a>) and others (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hellmer et al., 2002</a>) have shown that this antiporter is essentially inactive at pH 8. Down-regulation at acidic pH has not yet been shown experimentally (largely because there is no suitable pH-sensitive fluorescent dye), but follows from considerations of cell physiology, which indicate that the antiporter has to shut down at low pH (see <a href=\"#bib37\">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</a>). A shutdown at acidic and basic conditions is also a key feature of the simple kinetic model proposed by <a href=\"#bib27\">Mager et al. (2011)</a> for NhaA that appears to hold equally well for MjNhaP1. By this model the antiporter is down-regulated at pH 4 due to competition of H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> for a common binding site, and at pH 8 due to proton depletion. Together, these two effects result in a bell-shaped pH dependence of transport activity."

However, if Na<sup>+</sup> can displace H<sup>+</sup> and arrest the antiporter in a Na<sup>+</sup>-bound state at pH 4, the question arises why this does not also happen at pH 6, where the antiporter is fully active. The simplest explanation is that, in addition to substrate competition, the transport rate of MjNhaP1 is also modulated in some other way, for example by the protonation states of amino acid sidechains involved in ion binding and translocation that render the antiporter more flexible at pH 6 than at pH 4 or pH 8 (see also response to comment 4 below).

In MjNhaP1, we found no evidence of pH-induced secondary structure changes in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>. Instead, we find that Na<sup>+</sup> binding induces significant changes in helix arrangements in the 6-helix bundle. This does not rule out pH regulation by side chain rearrangements, as explained in the section \u2018pH dependence of transport activity\u2019 and Conclusions section of the revised manuscript."

By a different experimental approach, <a href=\"#bib27\">Mager et al.

A shift in the pH profile can result simply from changes in binding affinity (for Na<sup>+</sup> or H<sup>+</sup>). This is demonstrated by the NhaA mutant G338S, which has an activity profile shifted by 1.8 pH units towards the acidic range (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mager et al., 2011</a>), and evidently does not require an entirely new mechanism."
