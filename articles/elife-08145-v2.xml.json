An unanswered question is how polar septation activates a transcription factor (\u03c3<sup>F</sup>) selectively in the small cell. We present evidence that the upstream regulator of \u03c3<sup>F</sup>, the phosphatase SpoIIE, is compartmentalized in the small cell by transfer from the polar septum to the adjacent cell pole where SpoIIE is protected from proteolysis and activated. Polar recognition, protection from proteolysis, and stimulation of phosphatase activity are linked to oligomerization of SpoIIE. This mechanism for initiating cell-specific gene expression is independent of additional sporulation proteins; vegetative cells engineered to divide near a pole sequester SpoIIE and activate \u03c3<sup>F</sup> in small cells. Thus, a simple model explains how SpoIIE responds to a stochastically-generated cue to activate \u03c3<sup>F</sup> at the right time and in the right place."

This is particularly perplexing for cells that rely on random events to specify the genes they switch on. Normally, cells of a bacterium called <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> divide symmetrically to produce two identical cells that express identical sets of genes. However, <i>B. subtilis</i> cells can also undergo a developmental program to form a spore to help it survive periods of extreme conditions. To do this, first a <i>B. subtilis</i> cell divides asymmetrically by placing the site of division close to a randomly selected end of the cell. This creates a smaller cell that becomes the spore and a larger cell that nurtures the developing spore. Each cell must turn on different genes to play its role in spore development, but how asymmetry in the position of cell division leads to these differences in gene expression has been a longstanding mystery."

SpoIIE is made before cells divide asymmetrically, but only accumulates in the small cell. The experiments revealed that an enzyme broke down the SpoIIE protein if it wasn\u2019t in the small cell. This prevented SpoIIE from incorrectly switching on genes before division was completed or in the large cell."

A common mechanism for establishing cell-specific gene expression is asymmetric segregation of a cell fate determinant between the daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Horvitz and Herskowitz, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Neum\u00fcller and Knoblich, 2009</a>). In polarized cells, intrinsic asymmetry can be inherited from generation to generation. For example, the dimorphic bacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> localizes certain cell fate determinants to the old cell pole, leading to their asymmetric distribution following division (<a href=\"#bib26\">Iniesta and Shapiro, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bowman et al., 2011</a>). However, non-polarized cells such as <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> must generate asymmetry de novo, which is passed on to the daughter cells to differentiate."

To sporulate, cells place a division septum near a randomly chosen pole of the cell (<a href=\"#bib44\">Veening et al., 2008</a>) to create two unequally sized daughter cells with dissimilar programs of gene expression. The smaller cell, the forespore, which largely consists of the cell pole, will become the spore, whereas the larger cell, the mother cell, nurtures the developing spore (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

Escape from SpoIIAB is mediated by the anti-anti-sigma factor SpoIIAA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Diederich et al., 1994</a>).

SpoIIE converts the inactive phosphorylated form of SpoIIAA (SpoIIAA-P) to the active dephosphorylated form (<a href=\"#bib12\">Duncan et al., 1995</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Dephosphorylation of SpoIIAA-P by SpoIIE is therefore the critical event in activating \u03c3<sup>F</sup>. Understanding how SpoIIE reads out cellular cues to delay dephosphorylation of SpoIIAA-P until after septation and restrict phosphatase activity to the forespore is thus the central challenge in understanding how cell-specific gene transcription is established during sporulation."

This apparent contradiction led us to consider the possibility that spatially restricted proteolysis contributes to compartmentalization of SpoIIE. Selective stabilization of SpoIIE in the forespore coupled to efficient global degradation would enrich SpoIIE in the forespore despite ongoing transcription of <i>spoIIE</i> in predivisional cells and the mother cell.

Furthermore, FtsH is known to degrade transmembrane protein substrates (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akiyama, 2009</a>), making it an attractive candidate protease for SpoIIE. FtsH degrades several proteins that block entry into sporulation and prevent the expression of <i>spoIIE</i>, such as the Spo0A inhibitor Spo0E (<a href=\"#bib28\">Le and Schumann, 2009</a>). We therefore engineered the synthesis of SpoIIE during vegetative growth to bypass the requirement for FtsH in the expression of <i>spoIIE</i>. In exponential phase cells deleted for <i>ftsH</i>, SpoIIE was stable for more than 1 hr after chloramphenicol treatment, whereas in <i>ftsH</i> cells SpoIIE was degraded as rapidly as during sporulation (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 7.1 min) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

Polar enrichment was dependent on stabilization by removal of Tag<sup>SpoIIE</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> gray line). Because the forespore is derived from the cell pole, we hypothesized that the pole is a landmark that directs SpoIIE compartmentalization. In support of this idea, polar localization was abolished by the K356D substitution and partially restored by the T353I suppressor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> lower panel). Thus, the pole is a cue that directs compartmentalization of SpoIIE, and the same feature(s) of SpoIIE that is required for polar recognition is also required for stabilization and \u03c3<sup>F</sup> activation."

Recently, DivIVA was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with SpoIIE, making it an attractive candidate to anchor SpoIIE to the cell pole (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eswaramoorthy et al., 2014</a>). We found that whereas wild-type SpoIIE co-immunoprecipitated with DivIVA from extracts of sporulating cells (as previously observed), SpoIIE<sup>K356D</sup> did not (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Additionally \u2206Tag SpoIIE-YFP polar localization during vegetative growth was abolished by a <i>divIVA</i> deletion (in the background of a <i>minD</i> deletion to suppress the cell division defect of <i>divIVA</i> deletion) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, DivIVA directly or indirectly anchors SpoIIE at the cell pole and can do so independently of sporulation. Based on the result with the K356D mutant, we further propose that this anchoring serves to stabilize, compartmentalize and activate SpoIIE, and that these activities are linked through a common feature of SpoIIE."

This suggests that the divisome competes with the pole for SpoIIE binding and that SpoIIE is not free to associate with the pole until the divisome is disassembled. To investigate this model, we monitored SpoIIE localization in the background of a temperature-sensitive allele of <i>divIC</i> that stalls cell division after divisome formation but before cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Levin and Losick, 1994</a>). In this background, SpoIIE-YFP and \u2206Tag SpoIIE-YFP localized to the divisome (as visualized with a ZapA-CFP fusion) but not to the cell pole (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Similarly, when cytokinesis was blocked during sporulation by a <i>divIB</i> deletion (<a href=\"#bib43\">Thompson et al., 2006</a>), \u2206Tag SpoIIE-YFP localized to the divisome but not to the cell pole (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Therefore, the divisome sequesters and prevents SpoIIE from associating with the cell pole. We conclude that SpoIIE has affinity for two subcellular sites: the divisome, its dominant binding site, and the pole, where it is captured only after release from the divisome after the completion of cytokinesis."

We propose that SpoIIE is sequestered at the asymmetrically positioned divisome and is released and captured at the proximal (forespore) pole when cytokinesis is completed. In support of this idea, cells that cannot synthesize additional SpoIIE molecules in the forespore nonetheless robustly compartmentalize SpoIIE (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Asymmetric compartmentalization of SpoIIE in the forespore could be achieved by virtue of the close proximity of the divisome and the forespore pole. Weak SpoIIE association with the pole would be compensated for by the small volume of the forespore and reinforced by protection from degradation by FtsH. Finally, any SpoIIE released into the mother cell would be captured at the divisome, preventing capture at the mother cell pole. Thus, a simple model explains how SpoIIE is protected from degradation and compartmentalized in the forespore only after cytokinesis is complete."

To test this prediction, we sought to compartmentalize SpoIIE in cells that had been engineered to undergo polar division independently of sporulation. To do so, we artificially expressed <i>spoIIE</i> and overexpressed <i>ftsAZ</i> in vegetative cells, which was previously demonstrated to reposition the division septum from the mid-cell to near the pole (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ben-Yehuda and Losick, 2002</a>). To preclude transcription of sporulation-specific genes, we additionally deleted the master regulator for entry into sporulation, <i>spo0A</i>. We then visualized the localization of SpoIIE in these cells. As predicted by our model, cells enriched for SpoIIE were much smaller than average for the entire population (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Further, to ask whether this compartmentalization of SpoIIE was sufficient to direct cell-specific activation of \u03c3<sup>F</sup>, we additionally induced synthesis of \u03c3<sup>F</sup> and its regulators SpoIIAA (the anti-anti \u03c3<sup>F</sup> factor substrate for the SpoIIE phosphatase) and SpoIIAB (the anti-\u03c3<sup>F</sup> factor) in a strain harboring a reporter for \u03c3<sup>F</sup> activity. Remarkably, \u03c3<sup>F</sup> was activated with high selectivity in a subpopulation of the minicells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). We conclude that polar division is the only feature of sporulation necessary to restrict SpoIIE protein and activity to the small cell and that this is sufficient to explain compartmentalized activation of \u03c3<sup>F</sup>."

As the end of the cell used for asymmetric division is chosen without regard to whether it is the old or new pole (<a href=\"#bib44\">Veening et al., 2008</a>), the cues that SpoIIE interprets to achieve cell-specific activation of \u03c3<sup>F</sup> must arise de novo, that is, from the position of the septum rather than from preexisting asymmetry.

Genetic and biochemical evidence are consistent with a model in which stabilization, compartmentalization, and activation of SpoIIE are linked by oligomerization of SpoIIE molecules and that this oligomerization takes place in the forespore after asymmetric division. We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that oligomerization commences earlier in sporulation and that some other unrecognized feature of SpoIIE is additionally required for its transition to a stable and active state in the forespore. Structural information about the organization of SpoIIE oligomers and an in vivo assay for oligomerization may help distinguish between these possibilities and yield new insights into how it contributes to compartment specific \u03c3<sup>F</sup> activation."

Our model proposes two mechanisms to prevent predivisional activation of \u03c3<sup>F</sup>: First, the features of the forespore (small size, high concentration of cell pole, and proximity to the divisiome) that promote SpoIIE stabilization and \u03c3<sup>F</sup> activation are all emergent properties that depend on completion of cell division. Second, competition between the divisome and cell pole for binding to SpoIIE prevents premature accumulation and activation of \u03c3<sup>F</sup>. Although there has been uncertainty about when SpoIIE is released from the divisome and when asymmetry in SpoIIE compartmentalization is established (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eswaramoorthy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lucet et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wu et al., 1998</a>), our time-lapse imaging and structured illumination microscopy indicate that SpoIIE constricts along with the FtsZ ring during cytokinesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is consistent with our model that SpoIIE remains sequestered at the divisome until cytokinesis is completed. In the future it will be important to determine just how association with the divisome prevents SpoIIE from oligomerizing and activating \u03c3<sup>F</sup>."

We have shown that the N-terminal tail of SpoIIE is necessary and sufficient for FtsH-dependent degradation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>) and that stabilization in the forespore is mediated by features of SpoIIE that are required for interaction with the cell pole (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>,<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). Additionally, we have presented evidence that multimerization of SpoIIE is required for both stabilization and interaction with the pole. One possibility is that multimerization shields the Tag<sup>SpoIIE</sup> from FtsH as depicted in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>. Alternatively, as FtsH has been shown to have weak unfoldase activity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Herman et al., 2003</a>), multimerization might render SpoIIE resistant to FtsH unfolding and hence proteolysis. Finally, although we favor the view that SpoIIE is directly recognized by FtsH, it is conceivable that it requires an adaptor as is the case for some substrates of AAA+\u00a0proteases (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gottesman, 2003</a>). If so, SpoIIE could be protected from degradation by negative regulation of the adaptor."

We found that the V697A substitution locks SpoIIE in a high activity state in vitro, and restores \u03c3<sup>F</sup> activity in mutants defective for compartmentalization and \u03c3<sup>F</sup> activation. V697 is in an active site proximal loop (<a href=\"#bib30\">Levdikov et al., 2011</a>); in many PP2C phosphatases this loop coordinates a third manganese ion that is critical for activity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Su et al., 2011</a>). However, SpoIIE lacks the aspartate that coordinates this manganese, which could indicate that V697A locks the phosphatase in a conformation that compensates for the missing manganese ion. Additionally, we found that the stimulation of phosphatase activity (and binding to the pole) is genetically linked to multimerization: oligomerization, and \u03c3<sup>F</sup> activation were blocked by the substitution K356D and restored by T353I. We therefore speculate that multimerization induces a conformational change that organizes the catalytic center, compensating for the missing manganese and activating the phosphatase. A test of our hypothesis for a multimerization-dependent conformational change in the active site will require reconstituting multimerization-dependent activation of SpoIIE in vitro. Other PP2C phosphatases, such as the tumor suppressor protein PHLPP (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2005</a>), similarly lack the aspartate to coordinate a third magnesium ion, suggesting that our speculation, if correct, could represent a more general regulatory mechanism for PP2C phosphatases."

Capture at the pole, proteolytic stabilization and stimulation of the phosphatase all depend on oligomerization of SpoIIE. Thus, three interlinked regulatory events are sufficient to explain how SpoIIE exploits a stochastically generated spatial cue to the cell-specific activation of a transcription factor."

Cells were imaged after 4 hr of growth at 37\u00b0C. Segmentation was performed based on phase images subtracted for FM4-64 to identify division septa in chained cells. Cells enriched for SpoIIE-GFP were defined as cells with average SpoIIE-GFP intensity greater than two standard deviations above the mean.

First, the fact that SpoIIE was apparently active in the mother cell simply by eliminating FtsH-dependent degradation implies that the proposed change in SpoIIE oligomerization during spore formation may not be so critical to its activation. Second, it was noted that the authors haven't shown whether the activation that occurs in mother cells depends on cell division. It has previously been reported that overexpressing SpoIIE bypasses the requirement for cell division (Arigoni et al., 1999), which, with other data, led the authors to suggest that compartmentalization of \u03c3<sup>F</sup> activity occurred via the exclusion of an inhibitor (perhaps FtsH) from the forespore, so testing dependence is critical. These two issues should be addressed."

If the only role of oligomerization is to protect SpoIIE from proteolysis, then removal of the degradation tag should bypass the need for oligomerization and restore \u03c3<sup>F</sup> activity, even if it's no longer compartment-specific. This result suggests that the point mutants have independent defects in activating the phosphatase domain, or that oligomerization itself is necessary for activation. These predictions can be tested in part by analyzing the oligomeric state of their mutants in vitro and by showing oligomerization-dependent protease activity in vitro. In sum, it was not clear whether oligomerization of SpoIIE was protecting it against FtsH-dependent degradation or activating phosphatase activity, or both."

While I definitely agree that there is some evidence in favor of this model, notably the in vitro studies of oligomerization by a truncated SpoIIE coupled with mutagenesis, there is also potentially evidence against this model or at least insufficient evidence (i.e. the sucrose fractionation experiments noted in the responses to the reviewers) to make a strong conclusion. I think the authors should be more explicit in the Discussion about what the evidence is and they should probably cite the outcome of their sucrose fractionation experiments, both with the K356D mutant and as a function of development. On this topic: I'm also still puzzled why the authors are postulating that the multimerization of SpoIIE occurs in the forespore, implying that cell division and compartmentalization are necessary for this transition, and yet mother cells that can't degrade SpoIIE but haven't yet divided can still show some activation of \u03c3<sup>F</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Although predivisional cells only constitute 18% of the total cells showing \u03c3<sup>F</sup> activation in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, that result still implies, to me, that SpoIIE either multimerizes before septation in some cells or that it doesn't actually undergo a transition. Perhaps I'm being dense here, but this one aspect of the model still doesn't make sense to me and may need a bit of clarification and/or softening of the conclusions and statements about changes in multimerization."

These complexes could be indirect through SpoIIE association with macromolecular complexes such as the divisome, or could be mediated by the transmembrane domain of SpoIIE. Nevertheless, our in vitro studies of SpoIIE oligomerization combined with the unbiased isolation of a suppressor mutation that restored sporulation and oligomerization strongly suggest, we believe, a role for oligomerization in vivo. Furthermore, the additional experiments we performed dissecting the phenotype of the oligomerization mutant and its suppressor provide compelling evidence that oligomerization is required following the completion of asymmetric septation to interact with the cell pole, protect SpoIIE from degradation, and activate \u03c3<sup>F</sup>."

The major discrepancy as noted is with respect to the co-localization of SpoIIE and FtsZ. The main difference in our experimental approach is that we have taken time lapse images, while Eswaramoorthy et al. looked at static images. Because there is a lag between assembly of the divisome and constriction of the septum, and SpoIIE is released to the forespore while the FtsZ ring is disassembling, it is difficult to accurately stage the static images, which might have obscured the constriction of SpoIIE along with the FtsZ ring. To further document that SpoIIE constricts, we have taken additional time-lapse images of cells with the FtsZ ring and membrane labeled in addition to SpoIIE (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). From these images it is clear that SpoIIE constricts along with the FtsZ ring and is released after the completion of septation. Artifacts from the FM4-64 membrane stain can further complicate efforts to localize SpoIIE at the nascent septum. We imaged SpoIIE during sporulation by structured illumination microscopy, taking advantage of a fluorescent fusion protein to stain the membrane and mark the nascent septum. These images further supported our conclusion that SpoIIE constricts along with the nascent septum."

As noted in their responses, this did not work and apparently both sucrose gradient fractionation and co-IPs from merodiploid strains indicated that SpoIIE is oligomeric, even in the presence of the K356D mutation. Two points here:1) Did the authors examine oligomerization via sucrose gradients as a function of development to test whether oligomeric state changes, as postulated? This seems just as important to test as the K356D mutant. And if the experiment was done, it should probably be shown or at least discussed in the paper (see next point as well).</i>"

While I definitely agree that there is some evidence in favor of this model, notably the in vitro studies of oligomerization by a truncated SpoIIE coupled with mutagenesis, there is also potentially evidence against this model or at least insufficient evidence (i.e. the sucrose fractionation experiments noted in the responses to the reviewers) to make a strong conclusion.

Although predivisional cells only constitute 18% of the total cells showing \u03c3<sup>F</sup> activation in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, that result still implies, to me, that SpoIIE either multimerizes before septation in some cells or that it doesn't actually undergo a transition.
