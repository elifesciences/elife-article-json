However, the plausibility of nonenzymatic RNA replication is undercut by the lack of a protocell-compatible chemical system capable of copying RNA templates containing all four nucleotides. We show that short 5\u2032-activated oligonucleotides act as catalysts that accelerate primer extension, and allow for the one-pot copying of mixed sequence RNA templates. The fidelity of the primer extension products resulting from the sequential addition of activated monomers, when catalyzed by activated oligomers, is sufficient to sustain a genome long enough to encode active ribozymes. Finally, by immobilizing the primer and template on a bead and adding individual monomers in sequence, we synthesize a significant part of an active hammerhead ribozyme, forging a link between nonenzymatic polymerization and the RNA world."

Finally, by immobilizing the primer and template on a bead and adding individual monomers in sequence, we synthesize a significant part of an active hammerhead ribozyme, forging a link between nonenzymatic polymerization and the RNA world."

However, when life on Earth began approximately four billion years ago, polymerases had not evolved yet. This means that the genetic information of the first cells had to be copied some other way."

Previous studies have shown that it is possible to copy RNA without enzymes, but for only two of the four RNA letters, namely C and G."

The experiments showed that strings of RNA that were three letters long could catalyze RNA copying, just as long as they were chemically activated. That is to say, these short RNA strings allowed RNA to be copied without enzymes if they had a chemical group at one end that made them more reactive.Each short catalyst helped copy one of the four RNA letters, and adding several into one reaction meant that longer sequences containing all four RNA letters could be copied."

Further work is now needed to see if it is possible to copy other RNA sequences, and especially longer ones, without enzymes. Another challenge for the future would be to attempt to copy an RNA sequence multiple times without enzymes; a challenge that the earliest ancestors of cells on Earth must have overcome to pass their genetic information down through the generations."

However, the nonenzymatic copying of sequences containing all four nucleotides has not yet been possible for a number of reasons (<a href=\"#bib22\">Szostak, 2012</a>), most notably the slow rate of primer extension with adenosine and uridine monomers (<a href=\"#bib13\">Joyce et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Wu and Orgel, 1992b</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Deck et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, two adjacent A or U residues in the template will stop polymerization entirely (<a href=\"#bib26\">Wu and Orgel, 1992b</a>) under normal conditions; even partial copying requires extreme conditions, such as the eutectic phase of frozen samples (<a href=\"#bib23\">Vogel and Richert, 2007</a>), which are not compatible with replication within protocells. Extensive optimization of reaction conditions with the aim of improving the rate of primer extension with all four monomers, including varying the choice of divalent cation and leaving group, improved the rate and regiospecificity of polymerization for G and C but not A and U (<a href=\"#bib26\">Wu and Orgel, 1992b</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib27\">c</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Deck et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Inoue and Orgel, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Hagenbuch et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lohrmann et al., 1980</a>). Recent biophysical studies suggest that low A and U monomer affinity for the template is not the only reason for this problem (<a href=\"#bib22\">Szostak, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Izgu et al., 2015</a>) since A binds only three-fold more weakly than G, but primer extension with A is at least 100-fold slower (<a href=\"#bib13\">Joyce et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Wu and Orgel, 1992b</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Deck et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Heuberger et al., 2015</a>) than with G. Moreover, Deck et al. have shown that downstream helper oligonucleotides (<a href=\"#bib3\">Deck et al., 2011</a>) that provide incoming monomers with an additional binding surface improve the binding of A and U monomers, but the underlying difference in rates remains. The use of helper oligonucleotides allowed primer extension to proceed on a template containing all four bases over the course of several weeks, where previously such templates could not be copied at all."

                        "text": "Given the historical and continuing problems in demonstrating efficient nonenzymatic template directed primer extension, one might wonder whether this biologically inspired model is appropriate for replication within primordial cells. An alternative scenario that might seem more reasonable in the context of prebiotic chemistry involves template copying by the initial formation of short oligonucleotides, followed by ligation events that generate longer oligonucleotide intermediates and eventually a full length copy (<a href=\"#bib21\">Szostak, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">James and Ellington, 1999</a>). To test the viability of this hierarchical assembly model, we compared the rate of primer extension with activated monomers to the rate of ligation of two template bound oligonucleotides (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b,c</a> reactions 1 and 3). Nucleotides activated with 2-methylimidzole on the 5\u2032-phosphate have been used extensively to model nonenzymatic template copying (<a href=\"#bib3\">Deck et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Wu and Orgel, 1992c</a>), irrespective of their prebiotic plausibility, and were used in all experiments reported here. In both the nucleotide polymerization and the oligonucleotide ligation reactions, the chemical reaction is the same, i.e. attack of the 3\u2032-hydroxyl of an oligonucleotide on the 5\u2032-phosphate of a downstream nucleotide, with displacement of the 2-methylimidazole leaving group (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). Moreover, the reacting nucleotides are the same in both cases: a G at the 3\u2032-end of the primer and a G monomer or a G at the 5\u2032-end of an oligonucleotide. We expected the ligation reaction to be faster, because the oligonucleotides to be ligated are both stably bound to the template, and because the fully base-paired nicked duplex should be largely in the optimal A-type conformation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kozlov and Orgel, 2000</a>), whereas the primer/template complex with template bound monomers would be significantly more disordered. To our surprise, the primer extension reaction proceeded almost 100 times more rapidly than the ligation reaction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). This was true for a variety of trimer sequences (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In our search for an explanation for this unexpected observation, we reasoned that one of the major differences between the two scenarios was the presence of multiple adjacent 5\u2032-activated nucleotides downstream of the primer in the case of monomer addition, but not ligation, where there is only a single activated nucleotide. Indeed, the case for a role of a second downstream activated nucleotide is consistent with the well known difficulty of extending a primer to the last nucleotide of a template (<a href=\"#bib27\">Wu and Orgel, 1992c</a>). Furthermore, Orgel et al. showed over 20 years ago that efficient primer extension requires the presence of two activated monomers adjacent to the primer. Remarkably, the reaction is fastest when both monomers are activated with 2-methylimidazole instead of either or both being activated with imidazole (<a href=\"#bib25\">Wu and Orgel, 1992a</a>), suggesting a possible catalytic role for a physical interaction of the leaving groups of adjacent monomers."

We then measured the rate of addition of a monomer to a primer in the presence or absence of downstream nucleotides, with or without 5\u2032-activation of the downstream nucleotides (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c\u2013f</a>). Rates were calculated assuming a pseudo-first order rate equation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), because the concentrations of primer and template were far below that of the monomer, which would not change significantly during the reaction. Primer extension by addition of a single monomer, in the absence of any additional downstream mono- or oligo-nucleotides, was very slow and comparable in rate to the ligation of the primer to a 5\u2032-activated GAG trinucleotide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c\u2013f</a>, reactions 2 and 3). The binding of an unactivated AGC trimer, with either a 5\u2032 hydroxyl or a 5\u2032 phosphate, downstream of an activated G monomer conferred only a modest increase in the rate of addition of the G monomer to the primer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure\u00a01c\u2013f</a>, reactions 4 and 5), consistent with previous reports of unactivated downstream \u2018helper\u2019 oligonucleotides (<a href=\"#bib3\">Deck et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Jauker et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kervio et al., 2010</a>). Such helper oligonucleotides are thought to act largely by increasing monomer affinity to the primer/template complex by providing an additional base-stacking surface. In contrast, when the same AGC trimer was activated as a 5\u2032-phosphoro-2-methylimidazolide and used as a downstream helper oligonucleotide, the rate of primer extension (by addition of a G monomer) was increased by over two orders of magnitude (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure\u00a01c\u2013f</a>, reaction 6) compared to reactions with unactivated trimers. The rate of primer extension with a single G in the presence of an activated downstream trinucleotide was about twice as fast as the rate when the primer was followed by up to four sequential activated G monomers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c\u2013f</a>, reaction 1 and 6)."

At saturating concentrations (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) of each of the oligonucleotides, the rate of primer extension improved as the length of the helper increased from mononucleotide to dinucleotide to trinucleotide, and then stayed approximately constant with the tetranucleotide (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). At subsaturating concentrations of helper oligonucleotide, the rate of the primer extension reaction increased with increasing concentrations of di- or tri-nucleotide helper (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Assuming an error threshold of one mutation per genome\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Eigen, 1971</a>), this value of fidelity allows for effective genome sizes of 50 nucleotides, long enough to produce functional ribozymes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ferr\u00e9-D'Amar\u00e9 and Scott, 2010</a>). The fastest mismatch reaction was primer extension by G during copying of a template U, which was approximately 5% as fast as primer extension with A on the same template (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is likely due to the formation of a G:U wobble base pair (<a href=\"#bib7\">Heuberger et al., 2015</a>), and is consistent with previous studies of nonenzymatic primer extension reactions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Rajamani et al., 2010</a>). All other mismatches were at least two orders of magnitude slower than their matched counterparts. We also tested the effect of replacing the canonical U monomer with 2-thiouridine and 2-thioribothymine on the polymerization rate and found, in line with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib7\">Heuberger et al., 2015</a>), that this sulfur substitution improved the rates by approximately one order of magnitude (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>), bringing the rate of primer extension closer to the rates of G and C addition. More rigorous tests of fidelity, in which monomers can compete for binding on a template in all possible sequence contexts, are ongoing."

In order to iterate the process of trimer assisted monomer addition, after a downstream activated trimer catalyzes the addition of the first monomer to the primer, the helper trimer must dissociate to allow for the binding of the next monomer-trimer pair. To test the feasibility of this mode of primer extension, we designed a template that contained binding sites for all four monomers and synthesized the appropriate activated trimers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). We used 2-thiouridine monomer in place of uridine (see above), and all four monomers (A, G, C and 2-thiouridine) were present in every reaction. In the absence of activated trimers, we observed almost no primer extension (lane 1 <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>); even though all four monomers were present, their combined rate of addition was not measurable. Adding just the first helper trimer resulted in rapid addition of the first monomer (C) to the primer, followed by slow addition of the first trimer (AGC) to the growing primer. Similarly, adding two, three or four trimers together resulted in the generation of primers extended by two, three or four monomers respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). These reactions converted primer into a product with four sequentially added monomers with an ~80% yield after 16\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c,d</a>); single monomer addition reactions reached &gt;95% yield after only 10 min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). The difference between the fast rates observed in the trimer-assisted addition of a single base (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>) and the slower rate of trimer-assisted polymerization of all four bases simultaneously (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>) may be due to the competition of trimers for overlapping binding sites on the template. This hypothesis is supported by the decreased rate of trimer assisted primer extension with a single monomer in the presence of additional overlapping downstream trimers (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The copying of templates containing two consecutive A or U monomers is also made possible by the use of activated helper oligonucleotides (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

While our method can only produce sequences &gt;7 nucleotides in one reaction in low yields (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) due to the cross-inhibitory effect of trimers with overlapping binding sites (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we reasoned that a ribozyme could be synthesized by this approach if monomers were added, along with their attendant trimers, one at a time (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). To that end, we immobilized a template that codes for the sequence of one half of the hammerhead ribozyme (HH2) \u2013 on a bead and added matched pairs of monomers and trimers sequentially (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). Primer extension was monitored by gel electrophoresis. Despite the fact that no 2-thiouridine monomers were used (in order to protect the catalytic capacity of the ribozyme) a high conversion rate was observed at each step (75\u201395%) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). The reaction durations required to achieve these conversion rates varied widely, for example, the seventh monomer addition required 21\u2009hr to reach 95% while the eighth addition reached the same level of conversion after just 30 min. Generally, G and C additions were much faster than A or U additions; the reason for the discrepancy between the rates of these reactions on beads and those in solution is unknown. The use of s<sup>2</sup>U or s<sup>2</sup>T might offset some of the discrepancy. The final product was released from the bead by hybridization of an excess of a DNA oligonucleotide of identical sequence to the immobilized template. After DNase treatment, the hammerhead substrate, HH1, was added to the crude synthesized pool of oligonucleotides in the presence of 200\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> for 16\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). Despite the fact that this was a crude reaction product, with full-length HH2 comprising only 6% of the reaction products, the product mixture was able to function as a catalyst, with 50% ribozyme cleavage yield, thus demonstrating that a significant portion of an active ribozyme was synthesized nonenzymatically."

Short, activated oligonucleotides \u2013 themselves plausibly generated by either templated or untemplated monomer polymerization \u2013 are efficient catalysts of high fidelity primer extension with all four RNA monomers. Thus short activated oligonucleotides can play dual roles, acting either as catalysts of chain growth by monomer addition, or directly as replication intermediates, since they can also be incorporated into a growing chain by ligation. Template copying in a complex but realistic milieu containing both activated monomers and oligomers could therefore occur via a hybrid process combining primer extension with monomers and oligonucleotide ligation."

                        "text": "The disparity in rates between the reactions catalyzed by activated vs. unactivated trimers indicates a key role for the leaving group downstream of the polymerizing monomer. The slow rate of activated oligonucleotide ligation is also explained by the lack of a leaving group one base downstream of the site of the primer extension reaction: in this case the downstream position corresponds to the second monomer in the oligonucleotide which necessarily has no leaving group as it is linked to the upstream monomer by a phosphodiester linkage. The nature of the interaction between the downstream leaving group and the reacting monomer remains unclear. It is possible that the downstream leaving group interacts attractively with the reacting leaving group, positioning it optimally for attack by the 3\u2032 hydroxyl of the primer. As observed by Wu et al. (<a href=\"#bib25\">Wu and Orgel, 1992a</a>) this interaction could be very sensitive to steric effects, such that 2-methylimidazole at the downstream position would facilitate polymerization much more effectively than imidazole, though the authors ultimately concluded that such subtle effects are not likely to adequately explain the strength of the interaction. Wu et al. (<a href=\"#bib25\">Wu and Orgel, 1992a</a>) also suggested that the catalytic effect could be due to acid-base catalysis. Another possibility is that the upstream leaving group forms a covalent bond with the phosphate of the downstream monomer, a reaction that is only possible if there is a leaving group on the downstream monomer (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kervio et al., 2016</a>\u00a0and T. Walton and J.W. Szostak, unpublished data). This covalent bond could form before the attack of the 3\u2032 hydroxyl of the primer, creating an imidazolium intermediate, or in a concerted reaction where the leaving group of the upstream monomer replaces the leaving group of the downstream monomer. Further understanding of the reaction mechanism could lead to concomitant improvements in the rate and extent of template copying."

In fact, if the rates and fidelities of nonenzymatic RNA polymerization were sufficiently high, the need for a ribozyme polymerase in the RNA world may be circumvented: RNA could be copied by nonenzymatic chemistry alone until the advent of protein polymerases."

This was the focus of the works of Orgel, Ferris, and several others and still remains unsatisfactorily solved. The current paper proposes a possible mechanism that partially addresses some of the chemical problems inherent to abiotic polymerization of nucleotides, namely that certain nucleotides (e.g., A and U) are recalcitrant towards non-enzymatic polymerization, and that in general such polymerization is slow, to the point of being ineffectual in the face of the back reaction (hydrolysis)."

In the first paragraph of the Results, the authors use an (apparent) observation that, when activated with a specific \"high-energy\" leaving group (2-methylimidizole), the efficiency of mononucleotide polymerization is greater than that of oligonucleotide ligation. This would be somewhat unexpected because of several reasons including a perceived enhanced stability of the oligo on the template strand during the ligation reaction, compared to the stability of a single nucleotide on the template strand. But to show this, the authors compare the reactions #1 and #3 depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>. The accompanying text states that, \"[\u2026]the reacting nucleotides are the same in both cases: a G at the 3\u00b4 end of the primer and a G monomer or a G at the 5\u00b4 end of an oligonucleotide.\" But this is <i>not</i> the case: the oligomer in reaction #3 has an A on its 5\u00b4 end. This is particularly problematic because the authors make a big point about the lowered ability of A nucleotides to participate in ligation (or polymerization; the chemistry is the same) reactions compared to G. At first I thought it might be just a typo, but the same 5\u00b4-A appears in all of the subsequent helper trinucleotide oligomers. Unless I am reading this wrong, it appears as though the rationale for the rest of the project was thus based on a flawed premise."

I am always troubled by the artificiality of such imidazole-based activating groups, and thus I would ask the authors to comment on this more explicitly, and perhaps try other such activating groups.

The system described enabled the template directed synthesis of an active hammerhead ribozyme. This work is the first to report the nonenzymatic synthesis of a catalytic RNA using activated monomers. Prebiotic chemists have sought the means to simply and robustly copy all four RNA monomers for decades, with mostly limited success, for A and U in particular. Moreover, it has become increasingly apparent that the limitations imposed by A and U are nuanced, extending beyond simply diminished binding affinities. In keeping with the subtle nature of these systems, the authors have taken a known, but poorly understood, feature of 2-Me-imidazolide activated nucleoside phosphate monomers noted by Orgel, and applied it in a heretofore unanticipated manner. The authors surprising initially discovered that the rate of 2-MeImpN oligomerization exceeded the rate of activated trinucleotide ligation by nearly 100-fold, despite the greater template binding affinity of the trimer. On further investigation it became evident that consecutive 2-MeImp groups in subsequent monomers led to the enhanced rate, and, ultimately, the unusual discovery that an 2-MeImp activated trinucleotide enhanced the rate of monomer addition due to the neighboring 2-MeImp group. Thus, while Orgel had earlier shown that at least two consecutive 2-MeImpN monomers were required for efficient template directed synthesis, it was not possible to anticipate the effectiveness of the presently reported system for a variety of reasons, not least because it involves an activated trinucleotide rather than activated monomers, and historically there appeared little hope for efficient synthesis with A and U, consecutive 2-MeImp activating groups notwithstanding. The prospects of simplifying the reported system even further in future work are very exciting for the field."

In the first paragraph of the Results, the authors use an (apparent) observation that, when activated with a specific \"high-energy\" leaving group (2-methylimidizole), the efficiency of mononucleotide polymerization is greater than that of oligonucleotide ligation. This would be somewhat unexpected because of several reasons including a perceived enhanced stability of the oligo on the template strand during the ligation reaction, compared to the stability of a single nucleotide on the template strand. But to show this, the authors compare the reactions #1 and #3 depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>. The accompanying text states that, \"[\u2026]the reacting nucleotides are the same in both cases: a G at the 3\u00b4 end of the primer and a G monomer or a G at the 5\u00b4 end of an oligonucleotide.\" But this is not the case: the oligomer in reaction #3 has an A on its 5\u00b4 end. This is particularly problematic because the authors make a big point about the lowered ability of A nucleotides to participate in ligation (or polymerization; the chemistry is the same) reactions compared to G. At first I thought it might be just a typo, but the same 5\u00b4-A appears in all of the subsequent helper trinucleotide oligomers. Unless I am reading this wrong, it appears as though the rationale for the rest of the project was thus based on a flawed premise.</i>"

I am always troubled by the artificiality of such imidazole-based activating groups, and thus I would ask the authors to comment on this more explicitly, and perhaps try other such activating groups.
