It may be that the bending helps the virus to choose where in the DNA to insert and acts as a way to power the chemical reaction that joins the DNA. To investigate this possibility, Fuller and Rice performed experiments using purified fragments of DNA and the enzyme from Mu that does the DNA joining chemistry. The results revealed that making the insertion site DNA easier to bend made the insertion much faster. Furthermore, a mutant enzyme that struggled to bend the DNA had trouble keeping the chemistry going, and so the viral DNA would accidentally pop back out after it was joined. Thus the insertion site DNA is like a spring: the enzyme puts a lot of energy into bending it, but once the viral DNA has been inserted that energy is released to power the reaction to completion."

They have exhibited a remarkable ability to spread, such that sequences derived from transposons are pervasive in the genomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike (<a href=\"#bib5\">Aziz et al., 2010</a>). Among transposons whose behavior has been examined in vitro, the transposable <i>Escherichia coli</i> bacteriophage Mu is one of the most active (<a href=\"#bib17\">Harshey and Bukhari, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mizuuchi, 1983</a>) and well-studied (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib18\">Harshey, 2012</a>). Its transposase, MuA, belongs to the large DDE family of recombinases (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baker and Luo, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rice and Mizuuchi, 1995</a>). This family is named for the amino acid residues in their shared RNase-H-like catalytic domains that bind the divalent metals necessary for catalysis. In addition to the transposases for many common transposons, the DDE family also includes retroviral integrases, which use the same reaction mechanism to integrate viral genomes into host chromatin (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fujiwara and Mizuuchi, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2006</a>)."

The transpososome then hydrolyzes the phosphate backbone at the boundary between the transposon and flanking host DNA, and catalyzes the attack of the resulting 3\u2019 hydroxyl groups from each transposon end into the \u2018target\u2019 destination DNA. This critical second chemical step is referred to as strand transfer. In the case of bacteriophage Mu, the entire prophage acts as a transposon, and strand transfer occurs at positions 5 bp apart in the target DNA (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grindley and Sherratt, 1979</a>). Rather than catalyzing multiple turnovers like a typical enzyme, MuA remains bound to the branched strand transfer products until forcibly disassembled by the ATP-powered host chaperone ClpX (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burton et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mhammedi-Alaoui et al., 1994</a>), after which transposition can be completed by the host\u2019s own DNA repair and replication machinery (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mizuuchi, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">North and Nakai, 2005</a>). Although MuA is still active after removal by ClpX in vitro, it may be degraded by the ClpXP chaperone-protease complex in vivo (<a href=\"#bib21\">Levchenko et al., 1995</a>)."

First, successful transposition requires that they avoid selecting their own DNA as a target, as intra-self strand transfer can lead to deletion of some or all of the mobile element and a double strand break. To this end, MuA and some other DDE transposases interact with a partner protein whose role is to remain bound only to distant, non-self target sites. For Mu, this is the MuB protein encoded by the phage itself (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maxwell et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mizuno et al., 2013</a>), whereas retroviral integrases bind to host nucleosomes to choose a target (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pryciak and Varmus, 1992</a>).

Strand transfer merely exchanges of one pair of 3\u2019 hydroxyl groups and phosphodiester bonds for another and so should not provide a net release of chemical bond energy that could drive the reaction towards its products. Nevertheless, the Mu transpososome displays a strong bias towards catalysis of only the forward strand transfer reaction (<a href=\"#bib4\">Au et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lemberg et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mizuuchi et al., 2007</a>).

Four crystal structures of transpososomes and intasomes from the DDE family that include the target DNA are available, including that of the Mu transpososome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Maertens et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Monta\u00f1o et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Morris et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yin et al., 2016</a>). Beyond the shared catalytic domain fold, the specifics of the protein-protein and protein-DNA contacts in these structures are very different. Nevertheless, they have all\u00a0converged on a bend in the target DNA following strand transfer. Clues that target DNA bending can play a role in target site selection come from studies of target site preferences. In the absence of target selection partners, Mu and retroviral integrases prefer target sites with more easily deformable sequence steps, suggesting that DNA flexibility is interrogated prior to strand transfer and can guide target site selection (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haapa-Paananen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pryciak and Varmus, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Serrao et al., 2015</a>). This is supported by a structure of the prototype foamy virus (PFV) intasome bound to, but not integrated into, target DNA, which shows the target DNA bent in a conformation very similar to that in the strand transfer complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Maertens et al., 2010</a>). On the other hand, it has also been suggested that target DNA bending could prevent the reversal of strand transfer by driving the products (the new target 3\u2019 hydroxyl group and transposon-target phosphodiester bond) out of the active sites to reduce the conformational strain of the bend (<a href=\"#bib24\">Maertens et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Monta\u00f1o et al., 2012</a>).

We show that increasing DNA flexibility has a dramatic positive effect on the transposition reaction and that bending occurs during binding, implying that bending is required but carries a steep energetic cost. Afterwards, disintegration is very rare and occurs under extreme conditions that coincide with disruption of the bend. Further, a mutant transpososome with compromised target DNA binding and bending can be rescued by pre-bent DNA and is particularly prone to strand transfer reversal. Our results are the first to biochemically link unbending to reversal, and also point to target DNA bending as a key energetic barrier to strand transfer. This barrier would allow DNA deformation generated by other proteins to steer target site selection, and provide a way to channel product binding energy into preventing strand transfer reversal."

Because DMSO also affects earlier transpososome assembly steps, and to eliminate spare Mu ends or MuA subunits that could compete with our intended target DNAs, we first purified the CDC form of the transpososome by gel filtration chromatography. To prevent premature catalysis of strand transfer, CDCs were assembled and purified in a buffer containing EDTA and lacking Mg<sup>2+</sup>. A 2:1 mixture of MuA protein to Mu end DNA in this buffer results in a gel filtration peak shifted to a very high molecular weight that we identify as CDCs based on size and near-stoichiometric reactivity with target DNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

Binding affinities followed a similar pattern to reaction rates: The K<sub>D</sub> of CDCs for mismatched target DNA (regardless of DMSO) was about 15 nM, and for fully base paired target DNA with DMSO, about 29 nM. In the case of the mismatched target, good fits to the data required a cooperative binding model with a Hill coefficient of 3.3 (for the mismatch alone) and 2.6 (when combined with DMSO). We suspect this arises from transient CDC disassembly events that become significant at low nanomolar concentrations. Conversely, we were unable to detect enough binding to normal DNA under normal buffer conditions to confidently fit a binding curve, but can visually estimate that K<sub>D</sub> might lie between 0.5\u20131 \u00b5M.

We also note that the binding and kinetic data do not exactly correspond. For instance, although the mismatch and DMSO produced similar enhancements in target DNA affinity (with K<sub>D</sub>s differing by only two-fold), the mismatch had a much stronger effect on the strand transfer reaction than DMSO (with initial rates differing by about four-fold), even though the kinetic experiments were carried out at 100 nM, above the K<sub>D</sub>s for either of these target interactions. This suggests that there may be additional localized target DNA conformational changes, beyond those that are required for initial binding, that are necessary to properly position the target DNA phosphate backbone in the active site, and that are better facilitated by the mismatch than by DMSO."

The two copies of domain III\u03b1 from the catalytic MuA subunits pair in the middle of the target DNA U-turn (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), presumably countering the electrostatic repulsion between the two arms of the target DNA, as well as providing additional protein-DNA contacts. To test the importance of domain III in DNA binding, we repeated the above kinetic and binding experiments using CDCs lacking domain III on the catalytic MuA subunits. Note that domain III\u03b2, which comprises the C-terminal\u00a0~60 residues of MuA, was not included in the crystal structure because is not required for transposition in vitro, but has been included in the constructs used in this work. Although domain III can be removed by truncating MuA constructs at residue 560, transpososome assembly requires domain III\u03b1 to be present on the two MuA subunits not involved in catalysis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aldaz et al., 1996</a>). In order to localize truncated subunits only at the catalytic positions, we utilized our \u2018SinMu\u2019 system (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (see also <a href=\"#bib23\">Ling et al., 2015</a>). SinMu is a chimeric protein in which the sequence-specific DNA binding domains of MuA have been replaced with that of the unrelated Sin recombinase. It can be placed at the non-catalytic positions in the transpososome by a corresponding substitution in the Mu end DNA sequence (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Chimeric \u2018SinMu\u2019-containing CDCs that include the full MuA C-terminus at all subunit positions behave indistinguishably from wild type CDCs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and subsequent truncation of the catalytic subunits\u2019 domain III does not hinder assembly and purification (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

The reaction rate is otherwise exceedingly slow (&lt;1% of input after two hours under the next best condition, the mismatch alone). Measurements of target DNA binding by the truncated CDCs once again followed a similar pattern to strand transfer kinetics: binding was relatively robust when both modifications are present simultaneously (K<sub>D</sub> \u2248 38 nM), but undetectable otherwise (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Thus, domain III does indeed provide many of the protein-DNA contacts that are important to capture a target. High target DNA flexibility, however, can make up for the loss of these contacts. This confirms our assertion that the contacts are optimized for bent DNA."

We generated pre-bent DNA by creating 126 bp DNA minicircles (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Instead of just being more flexible, minicircles should be naturally and permanently held in a bent state. This should provide an even lower energy barrier to bending. Accordingly, we found that minicircle DNAs can rescue the strand transfer activity of \u0394 domain III CDCs under a number of conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). While \u0394 domain III CDCs generate a substantial amount of strand transfer products into linear DNA only in the presence of both the mismatched base-pair and DMSO, strand transfer into minicircles requires only one or the other. Thus the loss of transpososome-target DNA interactions can be mitigated by pre-bending the DNA. This is also further evidence that DMSO and the base-pairing mismatch allow the DNA to be more easily bent, and that target DNA binding is linked to bending."

The free energy landscape of this reaction might thus be expected to favor its reversal (hereafter referred to as \u2018disintegration\u2019). Nevertheless, our data above show that strand transfer is capable of going nearly to completion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), indicating that the STC is able to suppress disintegration. Given that Mu transpososomes are not true catalysts (each transpososome catalyzes a single strand transfer reaction, and then remains bound to the reaction products), it is likely that MuA suppresses disintegration by using product binding energy to bias the reaction direction toward the final product complex. Our finding that CDCs bind particularly tightly to artificially flexible DNA, and the observation that strand transfer should make any target DNA more flexible by nicking both strands, led us to investigate the relationship between target DNA conformation and disintegration."

                                "text": "We first wanted to establish the baseline rate at which the STC catalyzes disintegration. Published reports currently differ regarding this rate. It is difficult to address because it requires a starting pool of pure STCs (free of unreacted target DNA, which would be indistinguishable from the product of disintegration), and any purification protocols used must preserve the activity and structure of the STCs. This has been previously approached, to our knowledge, in two ways: (1) forming STCs by mixing MuA, Mu end DNAs and target DNA and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, as was done for crystallization (<a href=\"#bib33\">Monta\u00f1o et al., 2012</a>), then purifying the resulting STCs by electrophoresis in an agarose gel in TBE buffer (which chelates Mg<sup>2+</sup>), and (2) circumventing the issue of unreacted target DNA by directly assembling transpososomes on branched DNA substrates that mimic the strand transfer products (<a href=\"#bib4\">Au et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mizuuchi et al., 2007</a>). Both methods result in an off-pathway pseudo-disintegration reaction that has been referred to as a \u2018foldback\u2019 (see\u00a0<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The foldback products imply that some of the STCs in those experiments were either destabilized prior to the assay itself or not properly assembled to being with. To avoid these issues, we devised a new protocol (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>): STCs are formed by reaction of CDCs with labeled target DNA, but are immobilized on neutravidin-coated magnetic beads via biotinylated Mu end DNAs, such that remaining unreacted labeled target DNA can be rapidly washed away at the end of the STC formation step without stripping the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions from the active site. Furthermore, an excess of high-affinity (mismatch-containing) cold competitor target DNA is added in the final wash step to trap any complexes that undergo subsequent disintegration. Any residual unreacted labeled target DNA that was not removed in the washing steps can be quantified by sampling the mixture immediately after purification. Monitoring these purified STCs as a function of time shows that they are impressively robust against disintegration under our normal reaction conditions, with, at most, less than 2% of strand transfer products reverting to re-ligated target DNA after 60 min (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This is true whether or not DMSO, a mismatch in the target DNA, or domain III were present. Overall, these data suggest that disintegration events themselves are normally rare, regardless of target binding affinity."

Mu STCs react to the melting of the 5 bp overlap in the target DNA by catalyzing cleavage of the Mu end-target DNA junctions using a target DNA 3\u2019OH as the nucleophile. The difference between foldback, shown here, and a true reversal of the strand transfer reaction lies in the choice of which target 3\u2019OH is used in the reaction. Although the Mu end DNA products are the same, the target site becomes split into two hairpin ends. (<b>B</b>) The sequence of a SinMu end DNA fragment with 10 nt of flanking DNA past the cleavage site (compare to Supplemental <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We find that Mu end DNAs with this extended single stranded flank can trigger foldback disintegration under certain conditions. As in Supplemental <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, the nucleophile for strand transfer is shown in bold and red, and protein binding sites are indicated by black and blue arrows. (<b>C</b>) A target DNA fragment designed for simple detection of foldback products. The products of foldback disintegration from target DNA fragments where strand transfer occurs approximately in the center of the sequence (as is the case elsewhere in this work) are the same length (once denatured) as the input target DNA fragment, which makes the products of true vs. foldback disintegration difficult to differentiate. The target DNA fragment here uses an off-center mismatched base pair (bold green) to direct strand transfer to positions (red arrows) where it is possible to differentiate the 5\u2019-labeled intact target DNA (45 nt) from strand transfer products (15 and 25 nt) and from foldback products (35 and 55 nt). (<b>D</b>) Our disintegration assay does not trigger foldback disintegration. Here, the same protocol as in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> was used, but the target DNA was that from (<b>C</b>) and labeled at both 5\u2019 ends, and incubation time was 25 min. The expected strand transfer products are present, but foldback products are not. (<b>E</b>) Foldback disintegration is triggered under certain conditions. Here, we used the Mu end DNA described in (<b>B</b>) to form reversal-prone (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) \u0394 domain III strand transfer complexes. Purification of these STCs by gel electrophoresis followed by supplementation of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and heating for 25 min. using the protocol from (<a href=\"#bib4\">Au et al., 2004</a>) does trigger foldback disintegration at high temperatures (note the new 35 and 55 nt products in the 60\u00b0 lane). This demonstrates our ability to detect foldback if it occurs."

We note that the first two modifications might weaken binding between MuA and bent target DNA. Indeed, we found that the combination of slightly increased buffer pH (7.9 instead of 7.4), increased glycerol content (16% instead of 5%), and high temperatures (60\u00b0C) triggered disintegration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Under these conditions, WT STCs converted between 10\u201315% of strand transfer products back into intact target DNA after 1 hr, (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In our assay, this occurs without producing the \u2018foldback\u2019 products that have complicated previous studies (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). Unlike the forward strand transfer reaction, disintegration was not highly affected by including a mismatch in the target DNA. Remarkably, when subjected to the same buffer and heat challenge, \u0394 domain III STCs catalyze 4-fold more disintegration than WT STCs, reverting about 40% of strand transfer products back into intact target DNA."

Target DNA bending would bring the labels at each end of the target DNA into closer proximity, reducing the fluorescence intensity and lifetime of the donor Atto565 label. We used time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) to capture this decrease in donor lifetime. By measuring changes in fluorescence lifetimes, we are able to separate out contributions from unbound/unreacted target DNA and approximate the distribution of lifetimes (and thus the distribution of relative proximities) present in a sample (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We do this by first observing the behavior of the doubly-labeled target DNA alone, free of any transpososomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, first column). The 35 bp target DNA should keep the fluorophore pair\u00a0&gt;116 \u00c5 apart, well outside the 69 \u00c5 Forster radius (R<sub>0</sub>) for this dye pair. Indeed, the most reasonable fits to the decay of the DNA-only samples result from fitting a single discrete lifetime (shown as black bars) along with a minor (&lt;10% of total photons) population of very short lifetimes (shown in grey). We take the former to be the lifetime of the donor fluorophore in unbent DNA (where FRET is negligible), and the latter to be a combination of imperfections in the instrumentation and anomalous fluorophore behavior. Decay measurements taken in the presence of transpososomes were then fit as the sum of this unbound fluorophore lifetime and a gaussian distribution representing any shorter lifetimes resulting from transpososome-induced bending."

Comparing normal conditions to either addition of DMSO or DMSO plus a mismatched base-pair in the target DNA, our analysis indicates that all three show a population of fluorophores in a bent (reduced fluorescence lifetime) configuration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, second column). Once the contribution from unbound or unbent DNA is removed from each, the lifetime distributions from all three are centered at about 3.3 ns. This indicates that bound DNA is bent to approximately the same degree under all conditions and that enhanced flexibility acts largely to increase the bound/bent fraction. That the normal target DNA/normal buffer condition shows a large unbound/unbent fraction is not surprising, given we have shown it exhibits poor affinity and struggles to utilize target DNA to completion. There is some suggestion in the fitted distributions that more flexible DNA is bent more stably, as judged by the tighter widths (FWHM) of the FRET distributions, but this trend may be outside of the resolution of this analysis. If strand transfer is allowed to proceed (by using unmodified Mu end DNAs; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, third column), the bend remains nearly unchanged for WT transpososomes across both the normal and highest flexibility conditions.

We have shown that they can bind relatively tightly to target DNA when both DMSO and a mismatched base pair are present (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). However, FRET data for these same complexes indicates very little bending, despite the experiment being carried out at concentrations where the vast majority of the target DNA would be bound. This is direct evidence that our truncated CDCs are bending deficient. However, it is curious that despite a lack of bending they are still able to carry out strand transfer at a rate comparable to WT. It may be that there is a conformation of the target DNA that is competent for strand transfer (and still enhanced to a great degree by a base-pair mismatch) which does not necessarily bring the distant ends of the target DNA closer together, e.g. bends that are not properly phased for a U-turn, or it may be that the mismatch and DMSO allow rapid but very transient sampling of the strand-transfer-competent conformation. Nevertheless, after strand transfer proceeds and opens nicks in the target DNA, we find that the target DNA in \u0394 domain III STCs becomes significantly more bent and adopts a bend very similar to that seen in WT CDCs and STCs. This suggests that the breaks in the target DNA phosphate backbone allow it to access a bent conformation that is low enough in energy as to be resilient to the loss of some transpososome-DNA contacts. We also note that this convergence on the same bend coincides with the convergence in WT and \u0394 domain III behavior in resisting disintegration (at normal temperatures)."

Heating the samples resulted in sizeable broadening of the FRET distribution, particularly for the disintegration-prone \u0394 domain III transpososomes, and an increase in the fitted amount of unbent target DNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, fourth column). This means that disintegration coincides with conditions where the target DNA conformation is less stably controlled (and a fraction of STCs may have lost the bend in the target DNA entirely)."

Our model for this process is shown as a free energy reaction coordinate diagram in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>. In the absence of outside factors, newly assembled transpososomes bind to potential target DNA with low affinity. We hypothesize that this is because the target DNA must be strongly bent to optimize its contacts with CDCs, but free energy released by making those contacts does not compensate well for the conformational strain required to bend the target DNA. This is supported by our findings that enhancing the flexibility of the target DNA and pre-bending it both greatly enhance its affinity for CDCs, while removing some of the contacts that stabilize the bent form by deleting domain III greatly reduces its affinity. We also found that strand transfer rates correspond relatively well with target binding affinity, which suggests that getting target DNA into the active sites of the CDCs can be rate-limiting for strand transfer and thus provides a control point for determining the choice of target. This aspect of Mu transposition was exploited by <a href=\"#bib46\">Yanagihara and Mizuuchi (2002)</a> who showed it can be used in vitro to pinpoint a single mismatch in the presence of a vast excess of unperturbed DNA. Furthermore, in vivo transposition into unperturbed target DNA may be even slower than in our assays, as the presence of intact flanking DNA has been shown to further inhibit target capture (<a href=\"#bib44\">Williams and Baker, 2004</a>)."

Target DNA capture is energetically uphill because the target DNA must be bent. This equilibrium can be altered to favor target capture by factors that promote DNA flexibility (here, mismatched base-pairs, DMSO buffer, or mini-circularization, dashed red line), or to make target capture even more uphill by removing some contacts between the transpososome and the target DNA (here, deleting domain III, dashed purple line). Strand transfer interrupts the target DNA backbone, thus releasing the conformational strain induced by the bend while preserving or solidifying the protein-DNA contacts between the transpososome and target. This leaves the strand transfer products in a deep thermodynamic optimum that prevents disintegration. Our results indicate that domain III stabilizes the target DNA conformation to a greater degree after strand transfer. The dashed grey line represents a hypothetical transposase that binds to target DNA favorably and without inducing any conformational strain. (<b>B</b>) The features of the energy landscape outlined in (<b>A</b>) have the effect of resisting target DNA capture until an outside factor (e.g., MuB) can compensate for the uphill free energy difference.

                        "text": "Why should transposition be slow by default? Why scan through potential target sites? Although Mu and many of its transposon and retrovirus relatives do not hunt for specific target sequences, they do need to avoid inserting into their own genomes even though their own DNA is necessarily present at high local concentration. We propose that transposition is repressed by default except in the presence of DNA bound by target selection proteins. For\u00a0Mu, target selection is driven by the distribution of MuB protein, whose reported biochemical activities appear at first glance paradoxical (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib10\">Drami\u0107anin and Ram\u00f3n-Maiques, 2013</a>). MuB forms filaments along dsDNA in the presence of ATP (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maxwell et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mizuno et al., 2013</a>), and binds the C-terminal region of MuA (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wu and Chaconas, 1994</a>). Contact with MuA, even the monomeric form present before a transpososome is formed, triggers ATP hydrolysis and DNA release by MuB (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adzuma and Mizuuchi, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Greene and Mizuuchi, 2002</a>). Thus DNA near the Mu ends is probably cleared of MuB before an active transpososome is formed. However, MuB-bound DNA molecules are strongly preferred as transposition targets. Until recently, it has been difficult to explain how DNA sites coated or encased in MuB can be attractive targets. Our results suggest how transposition targeting mechanisms might activate transposition: their ability to present pre-deformed or pre-bent DNA. The structural data available for MuB and IstB (the related targeting ATPase from IS21elements) suggest that they have the ability change the helical conformation of the DNA they coat and/or to form bundles of protein-DNA filaments (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arias-Palomo and Berger, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Drami\u0107anin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mizuno et al., 2013</a>). Loops could be extruded from these large protein-DNA complexes by transient dissociation events within a filament or as the DNA crosses from one collinear filament to an adjacent one within a bundle. These loops could act like our pre-bent minicircles, triggering tight binding and rapid transposition. This is supported by the observation that Mu has a bias towards target sites immediately adjacent to MuB-coated DNA, rather than inside MuB filaments themselves (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ge et al., 2011</a>). For retroviral integration, nucleosomes provide pre-bent DNA by their very nature. Retroviral integration happens directly on the nucleosome, and a high-resolution structure of this event has been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maskell et al., 2015</a>). Nucleosome DNA could be a favored target as long as the energy needed to dislodge a DNA loop slightly from the nucleosome surface and into the integrase active sites is less than that required to bend DNA de novo. There is biochemical evidence for this energetic compromise, as integration is known to occur predominantly at positions that are bound least tightly to the histone core (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maskell et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Serrao et al., 2015</a>)."

These nicks would allow the adjacent DNA to locally relax to a less strained conformation while maintaining or strengthening the energetically favorable MuA-target contacts. Additionally, the structural consequence of relaxing the strain in the bent target DNA could be to eject one or both of the strand transfer product moeities (the target 3\u2019OH or new phosphodiester bond) from the active site, which is the case for the four available strand transfer complex structures (<a href=\"#bib24\">Maertens et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Monta\u00f1o et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Morris et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yin et al., 2016</a>).

The existence of a kinetic barrier to disintegration is supported by our finding a lack of disintegration products at 30 degrees, even under conditions where we would have expected any transiently-formed disintegrated target DNA dissociate because its affinity for CDCs is so weak: \u0394 domain III transpososomes with no DMSO, and fully base paired DNA with WT transpososomes and no DMSO (and with an excess of higher affinity cold target DNA present to trap any released CDCs). This implies that under these conditions, the transpososomes simply do not sample the equilibrium between the target capture and strand transfer complexes."

We suggest that heat weakens the protein-DNA contacts holding the strand transfer product moieties away from the active site and provides the thermal energy necessary to escape the STC energy minimum. Disintegration at 60 degrees was much more efficient for \u0394 domain III STCs than for WT ones. Because the \u0394 domain III CDCs have very low affinity for target DNA, this might be explained by their releasing transiently disintegrated DNA more readily. However, WT complexes have a much lower affinity for normal vs. mismatched target DNA, but these produced similar amounts of disintegration product. This suggests instead that domain III \u2013 target DNA interactions have an even stronger stabilizing effect on the final strand transfer complex than they do on the intermediate captured target, probably because the binding surface is particularly tailored to a target DNA conformation that is only readily accessible after nicking. Therefore removal of domain III appears to adjust the equilibrium between the target capture complex and the final STC."

Regarding the strand transfer step, we propose that removing domain III, heat, and the other buffer modifications that helped to promote reversal, move the system slightly toward this scenario by weakening the contacts between the target DNA and MuA. Heat also by definition helps cross the kinetic barrier between the two states (in both directions)."

Because the energy required to induce this bend in the DNA is only partially compensated for by energetically favorable protein-DNA contacts, CDCs have very weak affinity for unperturbed target DNA, which is reflected in very slow rates of strand transfer into those targets. As cartooned in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, we found that this barrier can be overcome in several ways: by lowering the free energy of the bent DNA conformation, using DMSO or a mismatch, or by raising the free energy of the initial unbound state by ligating it into a strained pre-bent minicircle. We suggest that in the natural pathway for Mu transposition, MuB protein does the latter, presenting pre-bent DNA to the CDCs. The affinity for target DNA could be manipulated in the opposite direction by removing domain III. That \u0394 domain III transpososomes are specifically defective in stabilizing DNA bending was supported by our observation that they could be rescued by increasing the flexibility of the target DNA or by pre-bending it. The strand transfer reaction greatly increases the stability of the final protein-DNA complex by releasing strain in the target DNA while maintaining, and probably increasing, the protein-DNA contacts. The stability of this complex shifts\u00a0the equilibrium of the strand transfer reaction strongly towards products."

Purified CDCs were serially diluted (in reaction buffer), mixed with 6 nM Atto565-labeled target DNA, and arrayed into a Corning 3575 black polystyrene 384 well microplate (Corning, Corning NY). Binding reactions were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. A Victor X5 plate reader (PerkinElmer) was used to read the anisotropy of the Atto565 fluorophore, using a 531 nm excitation and 595 nm emission filters and a 1.0 s counting time. The raw parallel and perpendicular photon counts were adjusted to account for the instrument response (G factor and plate positioning artifacts), and the resulting anisotropies were fit to an equilibrium binding model, accounting for receptor depletion, using the optimize.curve_fit function from the Python scipy package (Research Resource Identifier (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008058\">SCR_008058</a>). For each data point, 15 total measurements of anisotropy were made: three separate serial dilutions each measured by the plate reader five times."

These fragments contained a binding site for the Integration Host Factor (IHF) protein, which was added prior to ligation so that the DNA fragments would be bent in order to encourage circular ligation. IHF protein was purified using a protocol described previously (<a href=\"#bib42\">Swinger and Rice, 2007</a>). The sequences of the minicircle DNAs used in this work are given in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. In detail, the two DNA pieces were mixed in an equimolar ratio along with a twofold molar excess of IHF in T4 Ligase buffer (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at room temperature. T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs) was then added and the mixture incubated for 12 hr at room temperature. Proteins were removed by phenol:chloroform extraction followed by P6 column (Bio-Rad\u00a0Laboratories) buffer exchange into fresh T4 Ligase buffer. T4 DNA Ligase was added back in and incubated at room temperature for an additional 2 hr to remove any remaining nicks. This reaction mixture was phenol:chloroform extracted and separated by gel electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide TBE gel. The band corresponding to the circular product was identified by UV shadowing, excised, and extracted by shredding the gel slice and soaking in a\u00a0~15 fold volume excess of 10 mM Tris pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA for 8 hr at room temperature. Gel fragments were removed by filtration. To remove any remaining linear fragments or nicked circles, an equal volume of 2x BAL-31 nuclease buffer and 5 \u00b5L BAL-31 nuclease (New England Biolabs) were added and incubated for two hours each at 30\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C. The nuclease was removed by addition of EGTA to 20 mM followed by phenol:chloroform extraction and P6 column buffer exchange into a buffer of 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 15% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, and 2 mM EGTA.

Using a magnet to immobilize bead-bound CDCs, the mixture was washed to remove unbound protein and DNA and replace the CDC formation buffer with reaction buffer (including MgCl<sub>2</sub> and DMSO). An approximately two-fold molar excess of the indicated target DNA was then added for STC formation. This strand transfer reaction proceeded for 2 hr at 30\u00b0C, with gentle mixing every 30 min to keep the magnetic beads evenly dispersed. During the final 5 min, heparin was added to a final concentration of 0.05 mg mL<sup>\u22121</sup> to encourage dissolution of any incompletely formed MuA-DNA complexes. Immobilized strand transfer complexes were then washed four times into the desired buffer for disintegration (which always contained MgCl<sub>2</sub>). A\u00a0~5 fold molar excess of unlabeled cold competitor mismatched target DNA was added in the final wash. A sample was always taken immediately after the final wash (time\u00a0=\u00a00 min) to record the initial baseline levels of reacted/unreacted DNA. After this, the reaction was either sampled as a function of time or divided equally among three temperature conditions (30\u00b0C, 45\u00b0C, and 60\u00b0C) for 1 hr. Disintegration was carried out where indicated in either the standard reaction buffer used throughout this work, or reaction buffer modified to pH 7.9% and 16% glycerol. Samples of the reaction were taken by dilution into a 10-fold volume excess of 97% formamide\u00a0+10 mM EDTA that had been pre-heated to 100\u00b0C."

Given that the reaction is overall isoenergetic and disintegration is unimolecular, the mechanistic basis for this has not been clear. We found the authors' discussion of this phenomenon in terms of their experimental results (Discussion, last paragraph) to be difficult to follow. The idea of \"a deep energetic well out of which the strand transfer products rarely reverse, despite the otherwise enthalpically neutral (and likely entropically uphill) nature of that chemical reaction\" seems to be a thermodynamic argument that the STC product of the reaction has a lower free energy than the pre-cleavage complex. In this scenario, disintegration is energetically uphill because the complex needs to reach a pre-cleavage like configuration in order to reverse the reaction. Wouldn't this also imply that bending-compromised complexes would have even more difficulty reversing the reaction since they would be going even more uphill? The other point of confusion here is that the lack of reversal could be primarily a kinetic barrier; this could be what the authors had in mind, but if so it is not clear."

It is therefore hard to reconcile the rest of the figure. It seems that one could explain disintegration rates based on the stability of the target capture complex alone. For a stable complex (DMSO, mismatch), disintegration could occur at some rate, but the stability of the disintegration product just promotes target cleavage again and the energy relaxation resulting from nicking (as suggested by the authors) favors the STC. For unstable complexes, disintegration will result in a greater dissociation, giving the net effects observed."

We found the authors' discussion of this phenomenon in terms of their experimental results (Discussion, last paragraph) to be difficult to follow. The idea of \"a deep energetic well out of which the strand transfer products rarely reverse, despite the otherwise enthalpically neutral (and likely entropically uphill) nature of that chemical reaction\" seems to be a thermodynamic argument that the STC product of the reaction has a lower free energy than the pre-cleavage complex. In this scenario, disintegration is energetically uphill because the complex needs to reach a pre-cleavage like configuration in order to reverse the reaction. Wouldn't this also imply that bending-compromised complexes would have even more difficulty reversing the reaction since they would be going even more uphill? The other point of confusion here is that the lack of reversal could be primarily a kinetic barrier; this could be what the authors had in mind, but if so it is not clear.</i>"
