Here, we provide the neurosensory lineage reconstruction of a complex sensory organ, the inner ear, by imaging zebrafish embryos in vivo over an extended timespan, combining cell tracing and cell fate marker expression over time. We deliver the first dynamic map of early neuronal and sensory progenitor pools in the whole otic vesicle. It highlights the remodeling of the neuronal progenitor domain upon neuroblast delamination, and reveals that the order and place of neuroblasts\u2019 delamination from the otic epithelium prefigure their position within the SAG. Sensory and non-sensory domains harbor different proliferative activity contributing distinctly to the overall growth of the structure. Therefore, the otic vesicle case exemplifies a generic morphogenetic process where spatial and temporal cues regulate cell fate and functional organization of the rudiment of the definitive organ."

Here, we provide the neurosensory lineage reconstruction of a complex sensory organ, the inner ear, by imaging zebrafish embryos in vivo over an extended timespan, combining cell tracing and cell fate marker expression over time. We deliver the first dynamic map of early neuronal and sensory progenitor pools in the whole otic vesicle. It highlights the remodeling of the neuronal progenitor domain upon neuroblast delamination, and reveals that the order and place of neuroblasts\u2019 delamination from the otic epithelium prefigure their position within the SAG. Sensory and non-sensory domains harbor different proliferative activity contributing distinctly to the overall growth of the structure. Therefore, the otic vesicle case exemplifies a generic morphogenetic process where spatial and temporal cues regulate cell fate and functional organization of the rudiment of the definitive organ."

The inner ear is an attractive model to take on this challenge since it is accessible to manipulation, and it undergoes dynamic self-organization. It contains a manageable number of distinct cell types, which develop rapidly on an organized schedule to generate the functional units of the mature organ \u2013 the sensory patches. The key cell types of the inner ear, the supporting cells and the hair cells of the sensory patches, and the sensory neurons that innervate them, originate early during embryonic development from progenitors located in the otic vesicle, a 3D-structure arising from the otic placode adjacent to the developing hindbrain (<a href=\"#bib8\">Durruthy-Durruthy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Raft et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sap\u00e8de et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Satoh and Fekete, 2005</a>), and they are easy to score by morphology, position and specific markers (<a href=\"#bib14\">Haddon and Lewis, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Raft and Groves, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Whitfield, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Wu and Kelley, 2012</a>).

Neuronal vs. sensory specification is achieved through well-defined bHLH transcription factors: <i>atoh1</i> for hair cell formation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Millimaki et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bermingham et al., 1999</a>), <i>neurog1</i> for sensory neuron determination (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andermann et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ma et al., 1998</a>), and <i>neuroD</i> for sensory neuron differentiation and survival (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jahan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kim et al., 2001</a>).

However, the phenotypes of targeted mutants for these signaling pathways are not always easy to reconcile (<a href=\"#bib28\">Raft and Groves, 2015</a>), due to the limited comprehension of how developmental gene regulatory networks are integrated. For this, cellular data are needed as it can address how patterns can be achieved while the cells proliferate and the tissue undergoes morphogenesis, which may affect cell positioning and exposure to signals, and therefore cell specification."

Thus, it is time to progress in filling the void between gene regulatory networks and tissue architecture. With this purpose, we reconstructed the otic neurosensory lineage and investigated their single cell behavior by using in vivo imaging technologies paired with image processing tools (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Faure et al., 2016</a>). Our dynamic analyses revealed some surprising results such as the impact of neuroblast delamination and otic vesicle morphogenesis on the size and shape of this progenitor domain, and further that place and order of neuroblast delamination foreshadow their position within the statoacoustic ganglion (SAG). The comparative map of neuronal and sensory progenitors in the whole otic vesicle allows understanding how their distribution changes over time, being largely segregated with a small region of putative overlap. These findings provide the cellular data helping to understand how gene regulatory networks may work during development, tissue degeneration and regeneration."

Segmentation of the epithelial neuroD-domain allowed us to illustrate the quick expansion of this territory from anterolateral to posteromedial (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b\u2013d</a>), and when comparing three different embryos this emerges as a common trend (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2d</a>).

The lineage tree shows that within six hours a big bulk of neuroblasts delaminates (see white, yellow and orange lines in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a> corresponding to single delaminated neuroblasts), and many neuroblasts can divide after exiting (see lines branching in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) as previously described (<a href=\"#bib37\">Vemaraju et al., 2012</a>). This lineage analysis allowed ascribing delamination time (see hpf in x-axis in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) and delamination position to each neuroblast. Then, we color-coded the reconstructed cell centers according to these two criteria and displayed them (i) early when in the otic vesicle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,d,f</a>), and (ii) late when within the SAG (c-c\u2019,e-e\u2019,g-g\u2019). The first observation was that neuroblasts delaminated randomly in space and time (see intermingled colors of the reconstructed cell centers in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), but their organization within the SAG relies on the delamination order as delaminated cells aggregate laterally to the preexisting ganglion (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), thereby generating a mediolateral (ML) growth pattern with early-delaminated cells (white) located more medially than late-delaminated ones (red) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c\u2013c</a>\u00b4; see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013b</a> for additional analysis). While the inner ear grows and undergoes morphogenesis, the SAG becomes squeezed in the space between the ventromedial wall of the ear and the neural tube, such that its organization is gradually converted from ML to dorsoventral (DV), with early-delaminated sensory neurons located in close contact with the neural tube (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). Thus, the time of neuroblast delamination foreshadows the ML gradient of neuronal differentiation in the SAG."

We found that the relative position of progenitors foresees their final location in the SAG: neuroblasts from the anterior portion of the SAG delaminated from the anterolateral floor of the otic vesicle, while the ones of the posterior SAG derived from the posteromedial otic epithelium (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Next, we addressed whether the epithelial coordinates prefigure the position of neuroblasts in the SAG primordium. We observed that the anteroposterior (AP) coordinates of neuroblasts delamination (see differently colored epithelial cell center populations in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>) generally defined their relative AP position within the SAG (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e\u2013e\u2019</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>; see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1c\u2013d\u2019</a> for additional analysis). These data show that progenitors delaminating within similar spatial regions along the AP axis maintain similar relative positions later on, and indeed the analysis of their trajectories indicates that cells, while in the otic epithelium, maintain their neighbor relationships. No such correlation was observed regarding the ML axis, because cells that were originally separated in the epithelium were found close in the SAG (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f\u2013g\u2019</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>), suggesting that the AP and time cues prevail. These findings establish a link between the place and order of neuroblast delamination and their neuronal (functional) identity within the SAG, and suggest the existence of a spatial and temporal regulation in the otic epithelium of the fate and exit of SAG neuroblasts."

Due to the massive cell delamination in a relatively short time (more than 150 delamination events in the period 18-26\u00a0hpf), the neuronal progenitor domain undergoes dramatic size and shape changes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>, compare the\u00a0territory containing orange cell circles at 18\u00a0hpf and 26\u00a0hpf), as described by <a href=\"#bib14\">Haddon and Lewis (1996)</a>.

The exit of neuroblasts and the growth of the vesicle are part of the morphogenetic processes that progressively restricted the progenitor field to a more lateral region of the ventral floor of the vesicle (orange cell centers in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>, 26 hpf)."

However, one difference is that in the fish the first hair cells differentiate while neuronal precursors are still delaminating, and that hair cells continue to be produced throughout life (<a href=\"#bib14\">Haddon and Lewis, 1996</a>). This raises the question of how neuronal and hair cell production is coordinated from progenitor domains located very close within the otic epithelium, and this led us to compare the progenitor maps for hair cells and neurons."

In order to understand how these sensory patches arose we followed in vivo the incorporation of newly differentiated hair cells. The first hair cells to arise -the so called tether cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Riley et al., 1997</a>)- constituted the posterior pole of each of the maculae (white-dotted cells in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013c</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1b,c</a>) and prefigured the position of these sensory patches within the otic vesicle (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Next, these two sensory patches gradually increased their size incorporating differentiated hair cells at their anterior pole with a specific pattern (see color-coded cell centers in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b\u2013c</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>; ID Dataset: 140507aX; and see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1b,c</a> for additional samples exhibiting the same pattern). At the same time, growth and morphogenesis of the vesicle led to a structure in which the AM remained anterior and ventral, and the PM positioned in the posterior ventral edge of the medial wall of the vesicle. Once hair cells differentiate they become postmitotic (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Thus, the formation of the sensory patches depends on a pool of progenitors providing postmitotic differentiated hair cells. AM and PM develop asynchronously, with the incorporation of new hair cells being delayed in the PM (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Sap\u00e8de and Pujades, 2010</a>)."

However, they were unable to clearly assess the position of this progenitor pool and how it behaved. To do so, we first undertook the dynamical analysis of maculae generation upon neurog1-downregulation by injection of translation-blocking morpholino (ID Dataset: 140519aX, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#tbl2\">2</a>), which fully recapitulates the phenotype of <i>neurog1<sup>hi1059</sup></i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sap\u00e8de et al., 2012</a>). In the absence of neurog1, sensory neurons do not form and supernumerary hair cells are produced in the PM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f\u2013h</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Tracking the differentiated hair cells allowed us to compare the dynamics of sensory development at the single-cell level: the overall spatial pattern of hair cell generation in the AM/PM was very similar between control and morphant embryos (compare <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b\u2013c with g\u2013h</a>); however the kinetics of hair cell production in the PM differed due to a boost of differentiation in MO-neurog1 from 34\u00a0hpf onwards (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). All supernumerary hair cells in the MO-neurog1 originate from newly differentiated cells, and not from differentiated hair cells re-entering the cell cycle (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>)."

Furthermore, the position of hair cell progenitors foreshadows the organization of differentiated cells within the sensory patch, demonstrating that otic epithelial cells did not rearrange during early stages of hair cell differentiation. However, the relative positions of the maculae changed upon morphogenesis, resulting in the growth of the PM towards the anterior region while growth of the AM was mainly anterior and towards dorsal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c,h</a>). Finally, our analysis allowed us to compare the progenitor maps for hair cells and neurons at the onset of hair cell differentiation (24\u00a0hpf): they were largely segregated with a small region of putative overlap (<a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>), consistent with the existence of a pool of dual progenitors (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sap\u00e8de et al., 2012</a>)."

For this we used the Tg[Brn3c:GFP] H2B-mCherry injected embryo (ID Dataset: 140507aX). Cell behavior was assessed according to cell division (dividing/non-dividing) or cell differentiation (progenitor/differentiated) status. Cell position was monitored over time to identify spatial organization related to these features (<a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). Cells within the non-sensory domain actively proliferated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013c</a>; <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>); in contrast, half of the analyzed cells in the ventral region did not divide and some differentiated into hair cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d\u2013f</a>; <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>), suggesting that once hair cell progenitors are committed they divide less. Interestingly, even though the non-sensory domain displayed higher proliferative activity, it was less compacted (note neighboring reconstructed cell centers are more spaced in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013b</a> than in d\u2013e), supporting the idea that it contributes to the overall growth of the vesicle during this time window. To quantify this, we calculated the nearest neighbor distance (NN-distance) for all cells in these domains over time and plotted the reconstructed cell centers color-coded for their NN-distance in the whole vesicle (see that green cell centers are more compacted than blue ones in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>; see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b</a> for analyses of additional specimens)."

For this, we estimated the distribution of local cell densities over the entire otic epithelium (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5m\u2013n</a>; <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>).

This suggests that the impact of non-delaminated cells in the compaction of the otic epithelium is low. Thus, if in the MO-neurog1 cell density is not altered but cell numbers are higher in the vesicle, the volume of the otic structure should be larger than the control one. Indeed, when assessing the volumes by 3D-point-cloud segmentation the otic vesicles of MO-neurog1 were larger than the control ones (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c\u2013e</a>).

These results enable us to: (i) understand the proportions of the system, (ii) reveal the impact of morphogenesis in the spatiotemporal distribution of neurosensory cell progenitor pools, and (iii) provide the cellular data to complement the well described gene regulatory networks involved in neurosensory specification. Our strategy has been to analyze in depth and detail few selected embryos, and support our findings with lower power analyses of other specimens. This analysis of progenitor populations in their native environment over extended timespans provides the opportunity to understand in vivo cell behaviors, both at the single cell level and at the cell population level. However, due to the technically demanding nature of the experiments and analyses the sample size could not be very high. All biological systems have intrinsic noise, and therefore variability: absolute cell numbers may differ between embryos, the onset of developmental processes might occur at slightly different times, or even distinct transgenic backgrounds may behave different. Therefore, to overcome these possible biases we analyzed additional specimens with lower power analysis and demonstrate that our approach can yield reproducible results in terms of cell type proportions and cellular behaviors."

Interestingly, the position of hair cell progenitors foreshadows the organization of differentiated cells within the sensory patch, demonstrating that although the otic vesicle undergoes morphogenesis and cells do extensively proliferate, progenitors do not rearrange within the epithelium during early stages of hair cell differentiation."

Delamination place confers position along the AP axis of the SAG, and therefore function, most probably as the result of the integration of patterning signals involved in the emergence of the different domains (<a href=\"#bib21\">Maier and Whitfield, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Radosevic et al., 2011</a>). Additionally, delamination time prefigures the relative position of early-delaminated neuroblasts vs. late-delaminated ones and therefore, the gradient of neuronal differentiation within the SAG. Consequently, an epithelial neuroblast will need to integrate spatial (its position in the epithelium) and temporal (its time of delamination) information for its final allocation within the SAG. However, to achieve the fully functional organ, complexity needs to increase later on possibly by some new delamination events, division of SAG neuroblasts and changes in morphology. Given that auditory neurons, which innervate the PM, accumulate later than the vestibular neurons (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sap\u00e8de and Pujades, 2010</a>), it is possible that the majority of neuroblasts becoming auditory neurons may delaminate from posterior domains, since no specific increase in cell proliferation has been observed at later stages in the posterior part of the SAG (<a href=\"#bib37\">Vemaraju et al., 2012</a>). However, if this is the mechanism and how it is controlled remain to be explored."

However, the revised manuscript still does not address my only major concern \u2013 e.g. that most data reflect detailed analysis of only single embryos. The tables provided in the revision indicate that multiple embryos were examined for each set of experiments, but analysis of the \"extra\" embryos does not appear to be shown in any figures, and the bulk of data presented in the main display figures does not include more than one embryo. For example, a single embryo was used for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">4</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">5</a>. It is also possible that this same embryo was used in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, although this is ambiguous. Similarly, it is possible that only one control embryo and one neurog1 morphant were used for the bulk of data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Videos 6</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media10\">10</a>. Information about which embryos were analyzed should be explicitly stated in the figure legends. These figures do provide tremendous detail about a few select embryos, but I am still concerned about whether the patterns and trends they display are reproducible. For the \"extra\" embryos mentioned in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">2</a>, presumably the data could be presented in supplemental figures even if they are not as extensive of those in the display figures. Additionally, I feel there should greater effort to consider average trends taken from multiple embryos and somehow display such trends in the figures, such as in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5O</a>."

In this revision, the authors have added some samples of normal and Neurog1 morphants to quantify the total number of cells in the otic vesicle. A few additional embryos were added to analyze delamination kinetics, location of delamination (using unpublished data provide to the reviewers) and the pattern of hair cell differentiation. I also think this version does a better job of describing how the tracing of single cells through the stages of neurogenesis, gangliogenesis and hair cell formation, adds to the current state of knowledge about inner ear morphogenesis in the zebrafish. The movies are beautiful, the image analysis is sophisticated, and the insights gained primarily concern prepatterning of the neural progenitors based on location and timing of delamination. Additionally, by tracing progenitor proliferation in the neurog1 morphants, the authors ask whether or not the absence of neuroblast delamination could alter the proliferation or behavior of the cells that are thus remaining in the otocyst. This gives rise to otocysts that are larger, but no significant changes in cell behavior. The resulting increase in sensory cells does not, apparently, come from a change in proliferation of the progenitors, but is most likely a fate switch."

The data show individual nuclei and therefore they do appear to provide very precise information about absolute cell numbers, but only in a few individuals, and thus is it hard to generalise these findings."

Given the concerns raised from the earlier version of the manuscript, the authors must be up-front in stating exactly how many embryos and ears their analyses are based on. This information is hidden, and the descriptions do not always appear to match the tabled information. For example, the legend to <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> states that 'embryos' (plural) were used, but in the table, this transgenic and time combination refers to a single dataset. Is this one ear from one embryo? Information on numbers of ears and embryos should be provided at the start of the Results section, before a description of the findings, in addition to statements in the Materials and methods section and in the Figure legends. The relationship between datasets in the tables and numbers of individuals should be explained. This applies both to the wild-type studies and those in the neurog1 morphants."
