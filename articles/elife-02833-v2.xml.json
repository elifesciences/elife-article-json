                    "text": "The bithorax complex (BX-C) in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a cluster of homeotic genes that determine body segment identity. Expression of these genes is governed by cis-regulatory domains, one for each parasegment. Stable repression of these domains depends on Polycomb Group (PcG) functions, which include trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). To search for parasegment-specific signatures that reflect PcG function, chromatin from single parasegments was isolated and profiled. The H3K27me3 profiles across the BX-C in successive parasegments showed a \u2018stairstep\u2019 pattern that revealed sharp boundaries of the BX-C regulatory domains. Acetylated H3K27 was broadly enriched across active domains, in a pattern complementary to H3K27me3. The CCCTC-binding protein (CTCF) bound the borders between H3K27 modification domains; it was retained even in parasegments where adjacent domains lack H3K27me3. These findings provide a molecular definition of the homeotic domains, and implicate precisely positioned H3K27 modifications as a central determinant of segment identity."

Expression of these genes is governed by cis-regulatory domains, one for each parasegment. Stable repression of these domains depends on Polycomb Group (PcG) functions, which include trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). To search for parasegment-specific signatures that reflect PcG function, chromatin from single parasegments was isolated and profiled. The H3K27me3 profiles across the BX-C in successive parasegments showed a \u2018stairstep\u2019 pattern that revealed sharp boundaries of the BX-C regulatory domains. Acetylated H3K27 was broadly enriched across active domains, in a pattern complementary to H3K27me3. The CCCTC-binding protein (CTCF) bound the borders between H3K27 modification domains; it was retained even in parasegments where adjacent domains lack H3K27me3. These findings provide a molecular definition of the homeotic domains, and implicate precisely positioned H3K27 modifications as a central determinant of segment identity."

The bithorax complex is a cluster of three genes that together control the identity of the segments that make up the back half of the fruit fly's body. This gene cluster has been studied for several decades and these studies have helped to further our understanding of how genetic information is accessed and used to make an animal\u2019s body plan."

Proteins called Polycomb group proteins then keep the silenced genes off, in part by adding small chemical marks to other proteins called histones. Most DNA in a cell is wrapped around histones, and the addition of such chemical marks causes the DNA to become more tightly packed. This prevents the bithorax complex genes from being accessed and switched on. It had previously been suggested that each segment might have a unique pattern of chemical marks on the bithorax complex histones, but evidence to support this idea was lacking."

This revealed that segments closer to the embryo's head contain larger stretches of bithorax complex DNA covered with histones marked by the Polycomb group proteins. Bowman et al. also found that the coverage of chemical marks on the histones changed dramatically when one segment was compared to its neighboring segments. These sharp boundaries clearly outline which regulatory regions of the DNA are switched on and which are switch off; however the same pattern is not seen for the Polycomb group proteins themselves. Instead, within the bithorax complex, the pattern of these proteins is almost identical in different segments."

The choice must be remembered; this is often described as changing the epigenetic state. One prominent mechanism to fix such choices relies on the genes of the Polycomb Group (PcG). The members of this family have been well defined by genetic and biochemical studies (<a href=\"#bib43\">Simon and Kingston, 2013</a>). The PcG proteins are present in all cells, but they impose long-term repression on different target genes in different lineages. PcG proteins form distinct complexes with distinct functions. These include the PRC1 family of complexes, which compact chromatin and ubiquitylate histone H2A, and the PRC2 complexes, which methylate histone H3 on lysine 27. The molecular details of how PcG functions are coordinated to lead to repression are poorly understood."

Indeed, a mutation in <i>Polycomb</i>, the founding member of the PcG, was discovered for its segmental transformations (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lewis, 1947</a>). In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, the homeotics lie in two clusters, the Antennapedia complex (Antp-C) and the bithorax complex (BX-C). The BX-C is the better-studied cluster, due largely to the effort of EB Lewis. Lewis showed that mutations that transform specific segments align on the genetic map in the order of the body segments that they affect (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lewis, 1978</a>). The evolutionary conservation of this gene order, including that in the mammalian HOX complexes, suggests that chromosomal position dictates the expression pattern. Lewis used nested deletions to show that successively more distal genetic functions of the BX-C are activated in successively more posterior segments along the body axis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lewis, 1981</a>). The genetic functions are now thought to encompass nine regulatory domains, each for a different parasegment. The regulatory domains control three homeobox-containing genes of the complex, <i>Ultrabithorax</i> (<i>Ubx</i>), <i>abdominal-A</i> (<i>abd-A</i>), and <i>Abdominal-B</i> (<i>Abd-B</i>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maeda and Karch, 2009</a>). The regulatory domains have been roughly defined by mutant lesions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lewis, 1978</a>), and by enhancer traps in the BX-C, which show different anterior limits of expression (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bender and Hudson, 2000</a>). The molecular features that define these regions, as well as the precise locations of their boundaries, have not been defined."

We initially evaluated H3K27me3 patterns because they reflect the central function of PRC2. The entire BX-C is heavily marked with H3K27me3 in whole embryos (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schuettengruber et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">N\u00e8gre et al., 2011</a>). This histone modification is necessary for maintaining repression of BX-C genes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pengelly et al., 2013</a>), yet these genes are not repressed throughout the body. It seemed likely that parasegment-specific patterns of histone modification might be obscured when all the parasegments are pooled for analysis. Indeed, <a href=\"#bib35\">Papp and M\u00fcller (2006)</a> observed loss of the K27me3 mark across the <i>Ubx</i> transcription unit in haltere and third leg imaginal discs, tissues where <i>Ubx</i> is transcribed. These discs include cells of two parasegments (PS5&amp;6), and so it was not clear how the K27me3-free regions might correlate with transcription units or with the genetic regulatory domains. The issue could be resolved if H3K27me3 patterns could be studied in single parasegments."

To address this, we marked single parasegments with a combination of Gal4 and Gal80 drivers, and developed a nuclear sorting-chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing protocol. Gal4, a transcriptional activator, was expressed in a series of parasegments with a defined anterior boundary, and Gal80 was expressed in a pattern shifted one parasegment more posterior. Gal80 binds to and inactivates Gal4, leaving Gal4 activity in a single parasegment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Gal4 and Gal80 expression domains were established either by enhancer trapping or by selecting an enhancer to achieve the desired expression pattern (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The BX-C is almost completely repressed in PS4, with only a few neuronal cells on the midline showing UBX expression in embryos. The PS5 regulatory domain, associated with the <i>bithorax</i> (<i>bx</i>) mutant lesions, is defined by the low level of H3K27me3 modification across the leftmost (proximal) 92 kb of the complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). There is a sharp transition to full H3K27me3 coverage at a position upstream of the <i>Ubx</i> transcription start site. The low residual level of H3K27me3 marks in the 92 kb PS5 domain is likely due to partial contamination from more anterior parasegments in our preparation of PS5 nuclei (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In PS6, the leftmost 137 kb of the BX-C is clear of the K27me3 mark (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>); the additional K27me3-clear region reveals the PS6 domain.

The transition point to full K27 methylation coincides with the genetically defined <i>Fub</i> border between the PS6 and the PS7 regulatory domains (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bender and Lucas, 2013</a>). In PS7, an additional 36 kb was depleted of H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). This region includes the <i>abd-A</i> transcription unit, and is associated with the <i>infraabdominal-2</i> (<i>iab-2</i>) class of genetic mutations. We observed a reproducible mound of H3K27me3 in PS7 nuclei close to the <i>Ubx</i> promoter (arrow in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). This may reflect repression of <i>Ubx</i> by <i>abd-A</i> in this parasegment (<a href=\"#bib19\">Karch et al., 1990</a>), mediated by the PcG."

These enhancer traps show sharp anterior edges to their expression patterns, with the anterior-most labeled parasegment corresponding to the domain in which the insertion resides (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bender and Hudson, 2000</a>). In the current study, the border between the PS5 and PS6 domains, defined by the discontinuity in K27me3 enrichment in PS5 nuclei, lies 14 kb upstream of the <i>Ubx</i> promoter. However, transgenic reporter elements inserted between the <i>Ubx</i> promoter and the K27me3-defined border (presumably part of the PS5 regulatory domain) show patterns with a PS6 anterior limit. Perhaps the promoters of these reporters interact with the <i>Ubx</i> promoter in distinctive ways. There was also prior evidence of an active BX-C domain in PS4. An enhancer trap 3 kb downstream of the <i>Ubx</i> start site shows a PS4 anterior border (<a href=\"#bib9\">Casares et al., 1997</a>), and a ncRNA with a PS4 anterior expression limit is transcribed from the region 5\u201315 kb downstream of the <i>Ubx</i> start (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pease et al., 2013</a>). Despite the activity of these regulatory regions in PS4 cells, we did not detect a decrease in K27me3 at these locations.

In PS7 nuclei, we find both the POLYCOMB and POLYHOMEOTIC subunits of PRC1 are bound to the Polycomb Response Elements of the active PS6 and PS7 domains at levels comparable to those in the whole embryo profile (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H\u2013K</a>).

That view seems valid, but the concept of a PcG regulatory domain is much richer. In the PS6 domain of the BX-C, for example, there are many enhancers to drive <i>Ubx</i> expression in specific cells at specific developmental times, all of which are blocked in parasegments one through five, but active in parasegments 6 through 12 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bender and Lucas, 2013</a>). Individual enhancers need not include a segmental address that is specified, for example, by gap and pair-rule DNA-binding factors; their function is segmentally restricted by the domain architecture. Indeed, these enhancers will drive expression in a different parasegment when inserted into a different domain (as in the <i>Cbx</i> transposition, <a href=\"#bib37\">Peifer et al., 1987</a>). Each domain has a distinctive collection of enhancers; the UBX pattern in PS5 is quite different from that in PS6. Thus, there are two developmental programs for <i>Ubx</i>, one in each of these parasegments, without the need for a duplication of the <i>Ubx</i> gene. Other loci with broad regions of H3K27 methylation may likewise be parsed into multiple domains, once we examine histone marks in specific cell types."

It is interesting that both PRC1 and PRC2 components have binding patterns that do not fully reflect function (repression and K27 methylation, respectively), indicating the possibility that function of these complexes is regulated separately from binding (<a href=\"#bib35\">Papp and M\u00fcller, 2006</a>). The challenges now are to understand how PcG regulated domains are established, differently in different parasegments, and to describe the molecular mechanisms, including changes in chromosome structure, that block gene activity in H3K27 trimethylated domains."

The same was calculated for tags assigned a random location within the chromosome. The resulting distribution of random window coverages was then used to determine the significance of observed window coverages. Individual p-value cutoffs were selected based on manual inspection of each experiment. For samples with replicates, only regions significant in both replicates were used."

Regions greater than 50 kb were split into equally sized sub-regions. For each region we calculated the density, or total normalized coverage divided by region length. Replicate density values were averaged. To find differences, region densities for two parasegments were scatter plotted against one another, and a line of best fit calculated. Points located furthest away from this fit line were identified as the candidate differing regions. This approach allows us to account for the variation in sequencing coverage and noise for each sample and parasegment."

The authors must discuss their findings in the context of the findings from earlier studies (i.e. <a href=\"#bib35\">Papp and M\u00fcller, G&amp;D 2006</a>; Kwong et al., PLOS Genetics 2008; Soshnikova and Duboule, Science 2009). Directly relevant to the work by Bowman here, Papp and Muller had compared the chromatin of the HOX gene <i>Ubx</i> in wing imaginal disc cells where <i>Ubx</i> is inactive and in haltere and third leg discs where the gene is active. One key conclusion from that work was that PRC2 (as well as PRC1 and PhoRC) is bound at <i>Ubx</i> both in the inactive and in the active state (with subtle differences) but that the domains of H3-K27me3 are different in the two states, with H3-K27me3 covering the entire upstream, promoter and coding region in wing disc cells but being absent from the promoter and coding region in haltere and third leg disc cells. So the observation that H3-K27me3 domains correlate with inactivity of regulatory regions in the bithorax complex is not new but the nice data shown here in embryos (with modern genomic techniques) extend and refine these findings. From the above it also directly follows that it is key to find out about PRC2 binding at the <i>bx</i>, <i>bxd</i> and <i>abd-A</i> PREs in PS7 (Point 1)."

Given that the authors may already have chromatin from PS7 nuclei or can generate it as they did for several of their experiments in the manuscript, I do not think that it is asking too much to perform such a ChIP experiment</i>."
