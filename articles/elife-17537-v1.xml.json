This paper builds on prior work by demonstrating that <i>bicoid</i> RNA is transported along microtubules by dynein. Surprisingly, this is not sufficient to account for its anterior localisation at early stages because transport is non-directional, indicating that the RNA must also be anchored specifically at the anterior. <i>bicoid</i> mRNA assembles into mRNP particles of characteristic size at all stages of oogenesis that may be important for its transport and anchoring. This provides a new mechanism for <i>bicoid</i> mRNA localization, suggests a particular role for mRNP particles, and further contributes important in vivo observations on which further hypotheses and studies can be built."
