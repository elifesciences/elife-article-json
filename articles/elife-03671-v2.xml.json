They are present in many different cell types including electrically excitable cells in the cardiovascular and nervous systems (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dascal et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lesage et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Krapivinsky et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lesage et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Karschin et al., 1996</a>). GIRK channels regulate cellular electrical activity by modulating K<sup>+</sup> conductance near the resting membrane potential. Specifically, stimulation of certain G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) on a cell's surface leads to the opening of GIRK channels, which increases K<sup>+</sup> conductance and opposes the initiation of action potentials. This inhibitory effect on excitation is best understood in the cardiovascular system, where vagus nerve stimulation slows heart rate through acetylcholine action on GPCRs in atrial pacemaker cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Loewi and Navratil, 1926</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Giles and Noble, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Osterrieder et al., 1981</a>). The ensuing activation of GIRK channels prolongs the interval between pacemaker action potentials, thus causing the heart rate to slow. GIRK channels are also abundant in the nervous system, where they modulate slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents in response to neurotransmitter stimulation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Luscher et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lujan et al., 2009</a>)."

                        "text": "Cellular electrophysiology experiments and biochemical analysis have yielded a rich understanding of GIRK channel function. As background to the questions addressed in the present study, the following conclusions have been established over the past several decades of study. First, the G protein \u2018subunit\u2019 called G\u03b2\u03b3 (a tightly bound complex of \u03b2 and \u03b3 protein polypeptides) is the major mediator through which GPCR stimulation opens GIRK channels (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pfaffinger et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Logothetis et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Reuveny et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wickman et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Inanobe et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kofuji et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Krapivinsky et al., 1995</a>). When a GPCR is stimulated through the binding of a neurotransmitter (or drug) on the outside of the cell membrane it catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange\u2013GTP replaces GDP on the G\u03b1 subunit\u2013and release of G\u03b1(GTP) and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits on the cytoplasmic side (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gilman, 1987</a>). These subunits are then free to activate their \u2018target\u2019 proteins: G\u03b2\u03b3 activates GIRK. Second, the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) also regulates GIRK channel opening (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sui et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Logothetis and Zhang, 1999</a>). This property means that GIRK channels respond to more than one ligand and thus are under the control of more than one distinct signaling pathway. Third, the activity of certain GIRK channels, for example the neuronal GIRK2 channel, is also regulated by the concentration of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib54\">Petit-Jacques et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999a</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">1999b</a>). Intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration increases during excessive electrical excitation. Activation of GIRK2 under this circumstance may serve as a cell protective mechanism through action potential suppression. Finally, x-ray crystallography has recently provided atomic level descriptions of a neuronal GIRK channel, GIRK2, in the absence and presence of G\u03b2\u03b3, PIP<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib70\">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib71\">2013</a>)."

                        "text": "The present study addresses the following still unanswered questions. First, does the G\u03b1(GTP) subunit also regulate GIRK function? The G\u03b1 subunit co-precipitates with GIRK in biochemical \u2018pull-down\u2019 experiments (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Peleg et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ivanina et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rubinstein et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berlin et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2011</a>) and also exhibits interaction with the channel's cytoplasmic domain as detected by solution NMR spectroscopy (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mase et al., 2012</a>). Do these interactions underlie channel regulation by G\u03b1? Second, how does GIRK channel activity depend on the concentration of PIP<sub>2</sub> in the membrane? PIP<sub>2</sub> is a signaling lipid whose concentration in the cell membrane changes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lemmon, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Balla, 2013</a>). To know whether GIRK activity is responsive to these changes, a quantitative description of the channel's PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration dependence is needed. Until now, no method has existed to change PIP<sub>2</sub> in a known, quantitative and controlled manner in membranes in which GIRK channel activity is measured. Third, do G\u03b2\u03b3, PIP<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup>, act on the channel independently or do they function together? The issue of multi-ligand dependence is relevant to understanding the molecular biophysics of channel regulation and to understanding how multiple signaling pathways control membrane potential. At the level of molecular biophysics we wish to understand how multiple allosteric inputs regulate channel opening. At the level of cellular control of membrane potential we wish to understand GIRK's AND/OR relationship with respect to multiple signaling inputs."

In this study we use the planar lipid bilayer technique to characterize the regulation of GIRK channels by G-proteins, PIP<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions. The bilayer technique is a total reconstitution method in which the channel and its various regulatory components are first purified to homogeneity and then combined. Every component of the system is known to within a small error in composition and amount, including the membrane, which is produced from either purified or synthetic lipids."

To test this possibility we first fused GIRK2 channels and G\u03b2\u03b3 into the bilayer and supplemented the top chamber with 32 \u03bcM C8-PIP<sub>2</sub>, followed by fusion of vesicles containing G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GTP\u03b3S). C8-PIP<sub>2</sub> was used instead of brain PIP<sub>2</sub> to ensure that all the activated channels would be oriented with their cytoplasmic side facing the top chamber. To facilitate fusion (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fisher and Parker, 1984</a>), vesicles were applied in a solution containing 750 mM KCl. This concentration of KCl near the membrane surface produced a transient reduction of K<sup>+</sup> current\u2013until diffusion or mixing restored the local ion composition to bulk values\u2013as shown in the empty vesicle control on the left side of the trace (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

At micromolar concentrations, soluble G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GDP) closed GIRK2 channels, whereas soluble G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GTP\u03b3S) had only a small effect most likely due to small amounts of G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GDP) present in the G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GTP\u03b3S) preparation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

Given that the (unknown) partition coefficient is likely independent of C8-PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration, the titration in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> is valid for assessing the shape of the titration curve. But what we really want to know is the activity dependence of GIRK2 as a function of the mole fraction of PIP<sub>2</sub> inside the membrane. The practical difficulty in determining this is each measurement for a given mole fraction has to come from a different membrane; and each membrane has a different number of channels. In other words, to compare membranes we have to normalize with respect to the number of channels. To do this we produced membranes with a desired mole fraction of full-length PIP<sub>2</sub> in the lipid mixture, recorded GIRK2 currents, and then applied C8-PIP<sub>2</sub> to maximally activate (or nearly so), as shown (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Data from different bilayers could then simply be normalized with respect to their maximally activated current. The graph shows GIRK2 channel activation as a function of PIP<sub>2</sub> mole fraction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Here, as in the case of soluble C8-PIP<sub>2</sub>, activation is a sigmoid shaped function of PIP<sub>2</sub> mole fraction, consistent with a requirement of multiple PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules in channel activation. Moreover, the steepest portion of the graph (corresponding to a few tenths to one percent PIP<sub>2</sub>) is in agreement the known concentration range of PIP<sub>2</sub> in the inner leaflet of cell membranes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Heck et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">van Meer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Balla, 2013</a>).

Here we aim to replicate Na<sup>+</sup> dependence in the bilayer through quantitative measurements and to further our understanding of Na<sup>+</sup> activation by investigating the relationship between Na<sup>+</sup> and PIP<sub>2</sub> activation. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> graphs GIRK2 channel activity as a function of internal Na<sup>+</sup> or C8-PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). In these experiments GIRK2 channels and twofold excess G\u03b2\u03b3 (per channel subunit) were reconstituted into bilayer membranes. The 3 dimensional plot shows how these ligands' effects are interdependent (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). As shown earlier, robust channel opening is absolutely dependent on the presence of both PIP<sub>2</sub> and G\u03b2\u03b3 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). By contrast, GIRK2 channels open in the absence of internal Na<sup>+</sup>, but opening increases as the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration is increased. Viewed along the axis of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation, the presence of internal Na<sup>+</sup> steepens the dependence of channel opening on PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Thus, Na<sup>+</sup> is not essential but augments channel opening. The effect of Na<sup>+</sup> depends on the degree of activation by PIP<sub>2.</sub> In the presence of ample PIP<sub>2</sub>, channel activity increases as a function of Na<sup>+</sup> concentration most steeply in the range 0\u201310 mM. This dependence seems well matched to the concentration range over which cytoplasmic Na<sup>+</sup> levels change in response to excessive electrical excitation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Muller and Somjen, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Somjen, 2002</a>)."

Using bilayer reconstitution we find the following. G\u03b2\u03b3 activates GIRK2, as was previously shown (<a href=\"#bib40\">Logothetis et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Reuveny et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wickman et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kofuji et al., 1995</a>). G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GTP) does not activate GIRK2 and moreover does not appear to influence the activation of GIRK2 by G\u03b2\u03b3. These findings suggest, at least for the case of the activated form of G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub> (G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GTP)) and GIRK2, that physical interactions between these proteins, if they indeed exist, are without direct functional consequence."

                        "text": "G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub> inhibits the GIRK2 channel activity only when it is in its GDP bound form, consistent with the canonical view that GIRK is activated by G\u03b2\u03b3 and that GDP-bound G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub> sequesters G\u03b2\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gilman, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wickman et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Peleg et al., 2002</a>). In the bilayer experiments the action of G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GDP) is so rapid (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) as to suggest that it might bind to the channel and cause G\u03b2\u03b3 to dissociate. We think, however, that such a displacement mechanism need not be invoked to account for the rapid inhibitory effect of G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GDP). In drawing this conclusion we appeal to the inefficiency of G\u03b2\u03b3 to activate when it does not contain a lipid anchor. Presumably G\u03b2\u03b3 fails under this circumstance because, without membrane partitioning, its local concentration near the channel is never high enough to achieve sufficient occupancy to open the channel. Thus, G\u03b2\u03b3 apparently binds to the channel with low affinity, compatible with a rapid dissociation rate. Comparatively, G\u03b2\u03b3 appears to bind G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GDP) with high affinity, as this would account for sequestration of G\u03b2\u03b3 even when no lipid is present on G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GDP) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Therefore, it seems likely that G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GDP) turns off GIRK by simply binding to the free (channel unbound) form of G\u03b2\u03b3 and shifting the equilibrium away from channel occupancy by G\u03b2\u03b3."

During biochemical purification we have never detected a complex between these two proteins on gel filtration even when both proteins are at concentrations in the 100 \u00b5M range (<a href=\"#bib71\">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</a>). Using solution NMR spectroscopy, Shimada et al. estimated the affinity between G\u03b2\u03b3 and the GIRK1 cytoplasmic domain (which accounts for the full protein\u2013protein interaction surface) to be about 250 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#bib76\">Yokogawa et al., 2011</a>). Using this value, if we conservatively assume an association rate of 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> (well below the expected diffusion limit in solution) then the dwell time for a single G\u03b2\u03b3 on the channel is calculated to be about 100 ms, a duration much shorter than the wash out time in our experiments. Finally, a low affinity interaction matches the relatively small surface area (\u223c700 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>) of interaction between G\u03b2\u03b3 and its binding site on GIRK2 in the crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib71\">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</a>). Therefore, all observations are consistent with the idea that G\u03b2\u03b3 is in rapid exchange with its binding site on the GIRK channel."

                        "text": "Given the apparent low affinity between G\u03b2\u03b3 and the GIRK channel, the high affinity of G\u03b2\u03b3 for G\u03b1(GDP), and the absence of an effect of G\u03b1 on channel function, we think the following mechanism is most likely. GPCR activation generates G\u03b2\u03b3 and G\u03b1(GTP), then G\u03b2\u03b3 activates GIRK, but once GTP is hydrolyzed the resultant G\u03b1(GDP) removes G\u03b2\u03b3 from the channel by equilibrium-mass action. This picture is simple and in good agreement with the accepted view, but it raises the following question. If the affinity of G\u03b2\u03b3 for GIRK is so low and the interaction so transient, how does GPCR activation ever achieve sufficiently high concentrations of G\u03b2\u03b3 in the membrane to activate the channel? It seems unlikely that a single GPCR located near a GIRK channel would be able to generate a high enough local concentration of subunits to activate it, especially if multiple bound G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits are required, which we suspect is the case on the basis of the crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib71\">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</a>). One way to explain this dilemma is to imagine that GIRK channels and GPCRs might be co-localized in relatively large patches on the membrane. Such an organization would exploit a fundamental property of 2-dimensional diffusion: a point source in an infinite space has no steady state solution. In other words, the transition between local and bulk G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration will grow radially with activation time. Thus, in a patch of multiple GPCRs (and channels) a sufficiently high concentration of G\u03b2\u03b3 on the membrane could be reached. The possibility of co-localization of GPCRs and GIRK channels raises an interesting challenge to the replication of cell-like signaling in the bilayer. It could be that additional cellular elements (e.g., cytoskeleton) are required to perfectly replicate the signaling behavior observed in cells."

In the presence of G\u03b2\u03b3, GIRK2 channel activity shows a sigmoid dependence on PIP<sub>2</sub> mole fraction. A Hill plot yields a coefficient around 2.5. We cannot tell from our data whether PIP<sub>2</sub> binding is cooperative (as the Hill model assumes) or non-cooperative (e.g., if multiple PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules must bind, but independently, to open the channel). Cooperative or not, the sigmoid functional relationship points to multiple PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules required to open the channel. This result is consistent with the crystal structures, which show four PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules bound to the channel (<a href=\"#bib70\">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</a>). The apparent binding constant for PIP<sub>2</sub> is 0.8% mole fraction (Hill model), which, together with the Hill coefficient, describes the position of the steepest part of the sigmoid curve along the mole fraction axis. We see that GIRK2 activity is most responsive to PIP<sub>2</sub> in the mole fraction range 0.1\u20131.0%. This is precisely the range over which PIP<sub>2</sub> is known to vary in the inner membrane leaflet of cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Balla, 2013</a>). In other words, GIRK2 is poised to be under control by PIP<sub>2</sub> membrane concentration."

                        "text": "Finally this study addressed the interdependence of multiple ligands known to activate GIRK channels. Robust channel opening requires the presence of both G\u03b2\u03b3 and PIP<sub>2.</sub> Earlier electrophysiological studies concluded that activation can occur at high concentrations of a single ligand and that the role of G\u03b2\u03b3, for example, was to enhance the stimulation brought about by PIP<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sui et al., 1998</a>). Those studies were carried out in cells, where the composition of the membrane is not so certain. The planar bilayer experiments support a simple conclusion: G\u03b2\u03b3 and PIP<sub>2</sub> are simultaneously required to activate GIRK2. This conclusion is beautifully compatible with structural studies of GIRK2, which show that when PIP<sub>2</sub> alone is bound the channel's inner gate remains closed (it exhibits the same closed conformation as when PIP<sub>2</sub> is not bound) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</a>). But when both G\u03b2\u03b3 and PIP<sub>2</sub> are bound the cytoplasmic domain rotates with respect to the transmembrane domain and causes the inner helix gate to begin opening (<a href=\"#bib71\">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</a>). PIP<sub>2</sub> binds near the interface between the cytoplasmic domain and the transmembrane domain. We hypothesize that PIP<sub>2</sub> strengthens allosteric communication between these two domains of the channel. Such a strengthening of interaction would allow conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain, induced by G\u03b2\u03b3 binding, to open the gate in the transmembrane domain."

Na<sup>+</sup> increases channel opening in the presence of G\u03b2\u03b3 and PIP<sub>2</sub> and thus Na<sup>+</sup> is best described as a modulator of the other ligands' effects (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). This conclusion is easily appreciated through inspection of the C8-PIP<sub>2</sub> activation curve in the presence and absence of Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Not only does Na<sup>+</sup> increase the current level at any given concentration of PIP<sub>2</sub> (and a fixed concentration of G\u03b2\u03b3), but the shape of the PIP<sub>2</sub> dependence curve is affected by Na<sup>+</sup>. In other words, Na<sup>+</sup> does not simply scale the PIP<sub>2</sub> dependence curve. This is explicable if the binding affinity/effect of PIP<sub>2</sub> is coupled to the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999a</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">1999b</a>). In the crystal structure Na<sup>+</sup> binds at a location in between G\u03b2\u03b3 and PIP<sub>2.</sub> It is therefore reasonable to think that conformational changes induced by the binding of one ligand, for example Na<sup>+</sup>, would have consequences for the binding/effect of another ligand, for example G\u03b2\u03b3 or PIP<sub>2.</sub> Although Na<sup>+</sup> plays a modulatory rather than obligatory role in gating, its effect is substantial and occurs over the range in which cytoplasmic Na<sup>+</sup> concentration is known to change when a cell is experiencing excessive electrical excitation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Muller and Somjen, 2000</a>). These findings are in good agreement with the hypothesis that Na<sup>+</sup> modulation renders GIRK2 a negative feedback safety element (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999a</a>)."

Consider that G\u03b2\u03b3 is released upon stimulation of all GPCRs, but GIRK channels only open specifically in response to G<sub>i/o</sub> coupled GPCRs (G<sub>i/o</sub> refers to G protein trimers containing i/o class G\u03b1 subunits) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Breitwieser and Szabo, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pfaffinger et al., 1985</a>). It is easy to understand a possible origin of specificity when comparing G<sub>i/o</sub> coupled GPCRs (which activate GIRK) and G<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCRs (which do not activate GIRK) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lei et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cho et al., 2005</a>). G<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCRs release G\u03b2\u03b3, but at the same time the G\u03b1<sub>q</sub> subunit activates PLC, which depletes PIP<sub>2</sub> through hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cho et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Keselman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sohn et al., 2007</a>). In the absence of sufficient PIP<sub>2</sub>, G\u03b2\u03b3 cannot activate GIRK. Indeed, recent experiments have shown in both atrial pacemaker cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cho et al., 2005</a>) and certain neurons (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sohn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Yamamoto et al., 2014</a>) that G<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCR stimulation inhibits GIRK activation by G<sub>i/o</sub> coupled GPCR stimulation. It is thus reasonable to think that absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> accounts at least in part for the inability of G<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCRs to activate GIRK. G<sub>i/o</sub> coupled GPCRs on the other hand generate G\u03b2\u03b3 without degrading PIP<sub>2</sub> so both necessary ligands are available to activate GIRK. This kind of GPCR selectivity results because GIRK is an AND gate with respect to G\u03b2\u03b3 and PIP<sub>2</sub> activation. In addition to the more widespread (but not yet proved) idea of GPCR/target protein co-localization (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fowler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Labouebe et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cui et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Luscher and Slesinger, 2010</a>), AND gating of GPCR targets by multiple ligands provides a mechanism for selectivity in G protein signaling."

The reconstitution procedure is similar to that previously reported (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heginbotham et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Long et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tao and MacKinnon, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brohawn et al., 2012</a>) with some modifications. Briefly, 20 mg/ml of the above lipid mixture was dispersed by sonication and then solubilized with 20 mM DM. GIRK2 and G\u03b2\u03b3 were diluted with reconstitution buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA and 3 mM DTT) supplemented with 0.2% DM to 2 mg/ml (\u223c51 \u00b5M) and 4.8 mg/ml (\u223c106 \u00b5M), respectively. Equal volumes of 20 mg/ml solubilized lipid mixture was combined with each of these protein solutions to make protein: lipid (wt:wt) ratios of 1:10 and 1:4.2 with a final lipid concentration of 10 mg/ml. For co-reconstitution of GIRK2 with G\u03b2\u03b3, the two proteins were mixed, resulting in final concentrations of 2 mg/ml and 4.8 mg/ml respectively. Subsequently, this solution was mixed with an equal volume of 20 mg/ml solubilized lipid mixture. Detergent was removed by dialysis against reconstitution buffer at 4\u00b0C for 4\u20136 days. For reconstitution of G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GTP\u03b3S) and G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub>(GDP), the proteins were diluted to 4 mg/ml (\u223c100 \u00b5M) with reconstitution buffer supplemented with 0.2% DM and 2 mM of respective nucleotides. After mixing the diluted G\u03b1<sub>i1</sub> protein solutions with equal volumes of 20 mg/ml solubilized lipid mixture, the detergent was removed by dialysis against reconstitution buffer supplemented with either 10 \u03bcM GTP\u03b3S or GDP, at 4\u00b0C for 4\u20136 days. The resulting proteoliposomes were flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen in 20 \u03bcl aliquots and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until needed."

In some experiments, 1\u20134% (wt%) of brain PIP<sub>2</sub> (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was added into the lipid mixture. In most experiments the same buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA) was used in both chambers. Voltage across the lipid bilayer was clamped with an Axopatch 200B amplifier in whole-cell mode. The analog current signal was low-pass filtered at 1 kHz (Bessel) and digitized at 20 kHz with a Digidata 1322A digitizer. Digitized data were recorded on a computer using the software pClamp (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For local perfusion, a SmartSquirt8 ValveLink Micro-Perfusion System (Automate Scientific, Berkeley, CA) was used with a 250 \u03bcm diameter perfusion pencil positioned just above the lipid bilayer. Recordings were performed at room temperature."

For what seems like millennia of time and kilograms of publications on cellular patch-recording, GIRK channels have been understood to be activated on the intracellular side by G-proteins, PIP<sub>2</sub>, and in some case Na<sup>+</sup> ions. But the complexity of the cell membrane, even when detached from the cell itself, has stymied a quantitative analysis of these effectors. This is not a persnickety pedant's problem of being unable to dot some inconsequential i's and cross some trivial t's, but is a basic deficit that has persistently prevented the field from developing a satisfactory picture of GIRK function. For many channels, such functional landscapes were well worked out long before crystal structures appeared, but for GIRK it's the reverse situation. The various GIRK structures that have been emerging from MacKinnon's lab over past years have been a bit thin on the function that the structures would be so valuable in explaining. Instead, features such as PIP<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup> activation had almost to be \u201cread into\u201d the new structures rather than being explained by them."

Now, the important GIRK effectors are examined with full reductionist control, of both protein and lipid bilayer composition: G-protein subunits charged with relevant nucleotides, PIP<sub>2</sub> etc, all in quantitatively manipulable amounts. The conclusions are not surprising \u2013 the basic lessons have been long suspected, both from qualitative probing by cellular electrophysiology and by MacKinnon's previous GIRK structures \u2013 but they are deeply satisfying and now quantitative. In essence, the functions explain the structures, for a refreshing change. Particularly important is \u2013 at last \u2013 a proper activation curve for PIP<sub>2</sub>, real PIP<sub>2</sub> from real brains, along with a comparison to the convenient, commonly used exogenous C8-analog. It's also satisfying to see a Hill-fit (nH=2.7) accompanied by an unapologetic assertion that this, while consistent with involvement of 4 binding sites, long-envisioned in cartoons and now seen in crystal structures, cannot adequately distinguish cooperative from independent activator binding. In addition, the effect of Na<sup>+</sup> as a modulator of PIP<sub>2</sub> action is clearly shown by direct experiments, simple on paper but never before properly implemented. The authors even treat old-timers with a brief historical frisson by re-visiting the non-role of G\u03b1, lubrol and all, reminding them of the Great Clapham-Brown Debates of yore that established for the first time the central place of G\u03b2\u03b3 in GIRK function. Finally, the exposition relates the mechanistic minutiae uncovered here to central biological roles of GIRKs in cardiac and neuronal electrical behaviors."
