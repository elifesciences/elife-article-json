A provocative answer provided by Steinbaugh et al. is that <i>glp-1</i> mutants are fat because they accumulate excessive quantities of yolk, which transports nutrients from the intestine to the egg cells in the germ line tissue. Yolk particles\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which are made of lipids and proteins\u00a0\u2013\u00a0are produced in intestinal cells, secreted and then taken up by the developing egg cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Grant and Hirsh, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). As an individual <i>C. elegans</i> hermaphrodite is capable of producing its body weight in progeny every day, any changes to the flow of yolk particles to the germ line tissue can dominate the overall fat content of the organism. In the <i>glp-1</i> mutants, the intestinal cells continue to produce copious amounts of yolk, which accumulates due to the lack of germ line cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

In wildtype hermaphrodite worms (left), lipids are packaged into yolk particles (YP), which are then secreted into a cavity called the pseudocoelom and taken up by egg cells (oocytes) in the germ line. The signals that promote yolk production have not yet been identified, but are likely to come from cells in the somatic gonad (dotted arrow). In the <i>glp-1</i> mutants (right), the stem cells that give rise to the egg cells are absent: however, these sterile worms still produce yolk particles, which accumulate in the body and trigger a stress response. This response involves lipase enzymes (not shown) within the lysosomes that produce metabolites of oleic acid (OA). These molecules act as signaling molecules to activate, either directly or indirectly, the transcription factors NHR-80 and SKN-1, which promote longevity. One of the roles of SKN-1 is to limit the accumulation of fat and yolk."

As such, the activation of SKN-1 in animals lacking germ line cells helps to reduce the burden caused by the excess lipids and the resulting accumulation of yolk (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In the process of dealing with the stress of elevated lipid levels, animals turn on molecular mechanisms that extend lifespan."

However, this study, does not rule out the possibility that the gonad sends out additional signals that influence lifespan."

                "text": "By revealing that the excess lipids in <i>glp-1</i> mutants are likely due to the accumulation of yolk, the work of Steinbaugh et al. starts to address another conundrum: many of the changes in gene expression that are activated in the <i>glp-1</i> mutants (and are required for the longevity of the mutants) can also be activated by nutrient deprivation in wildtype worms. This suggests that while the yolk and stored lipids are chemically and biologically related, they have different functions and should not be treated as a single entity, as most studies of <i>C. elegans</i> fat content currently do. Finally, given the similarities between the <i>C. elegans</i> intestine and the mammalian liver, the results of this study also suggest that the mammalian equivalents of SKN-1, the Nrf transcription factors, may limit susceptibility to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in a similar way."
