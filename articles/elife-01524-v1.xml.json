                    "text": "Synaptotagmin (syt) 7 is one of three syt isoforms found in all metazoans; it is ubiquitously expressed, yet its function in neurons remains obscure. Here, we resolved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent synaptic vesicle (SV) replenishment pathways, and found that syt 7 plays a selective and critical role in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathway. Mutations that disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to syt 7 abolish this function, suggesting that syt 7 functions as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for replenishment. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) has also been implicated in SV replenishment, and we found that loss of syt 7 was phenocopied by a CaM antagonist. Moreover, we discovered that syt 7 binds to CaM in a highly specific and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner; this interaction requires intact Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites within syt 7. Together, these data indicate that a complex of two conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins, syt 7 and CaM, serve as a key regulator of SV replenishment in presynaptic nerve terminals."

Here, we resolved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent synaptic vesicle (SV) replenishment pathways, and found that syt 7 plays a selective and critical role in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathway. Mutations that disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to syt 7 abolish this function, suggesting that syt 7 functions as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor for replenishment. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) has also been implicated in SV replenishment, and we found that loss of syt 7 was phenocopied by a CaM antagonist. Moreover, we discovered that syt 7 binds to CaM in a highly specific and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner; this interaction requires intact Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites within syt 7. Together, these data indicate that a complex of two conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins, syt 7 and CaM, serve as a key regulator of SV replenishment in presynaptic nerve terminals."

For example, the replenishment of synaptic vesicles (SV) in the readily releasable pool (RRP), which can be exhausted during high frequency stimulation (HFS), plays a critical role in determining the rate and degree of short-term synaptic depression (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang and Kaczmarek, 1998</a>). It has been reported that Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays an important role in the replenishment step (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dittman and Regehr, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wang and Kaczmarek, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hosoi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sakaba, 2008</a>). Thus, identification of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for SV replenishment has emerged as a critical issue, and the ubiquitous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein CaM has been implicated in this process (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sakaba and Neher, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hosoi et al., 2007</a>), by interacting with Munc13-1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lipstein et al., 2013</a>)."

Of the 17 syt isoforms in the mammalian genome, only syt 1, 4, and 7 appear to be expressed in all metazoans (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barber et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that they are involved in key, evolutionarily conserved, membrane trafficking pathways. In neurons, functions for syt 1 and 4 have been established. Syt 1 serves as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for fast synchronous SV release (<a href=\"#bib16\">Geppert et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Koh and Bellen, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nishiki and Augustine, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 2009</a>), and syt 4 modulates transmission by regulating neurotrophin release (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dean et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2012b</a>) and also regulates exocytosis in the posterior pituitary (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). One group reported that <i>Syt7</i> knock-out (KO) mice (hereafter termed KO) had normal synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maximov et al., 2008</a>), but in a more recent study from the same group concluded that syt 7 functions as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for asynchronous release (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bacaj et al., 2013</a>). It was proposed that this contradiction was due to the use of KO mice in the former study, as opposed to the more acute knock-down (KD) approach used in the latter study. However, KD of syt 7 in otherwise WT neurons had no effect (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bacaj et al., 2013</a>), so the physiological function of syt 7 in the mammalian central nervous system remains an open issue, whereas there is evidence that syt 7 regulates asynchronous synaptic transmission at the Zebrafish neuromuscular junction (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wen et al., 2010</a>). The apparent discrepancy regarding the physiological function of syt 7 between mice and Zebrafish is likely due to species differences, analogous to the different functions of syt 4 in <i>Drosophila</i> vs mice (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yoshihara et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dean et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wang and Chapman, 2010</a>)."

We then carried out paired recordings by stimulating one neuron with a bipolar glass electrode and recording from a second synaptically connected neuron, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 2009</a>), to examine evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) triggered by single action potentials (AP). The EPSC amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013I,K\u2013L</a>), and the charge transfer kinetics (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>), were also unchanged in the KOs, confirming that syt 7 does not function as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for asynchronous release in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maximov et al., 2008</a>).

We also measured synaptic depression during trains of HFS (20 Hz/2.5 s, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The PPR was the same between WT and KO neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), but KO neurons displayed faster depression during HFS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Importantly, expression of WT syt 7, but not the 4D/N Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ligand mutant (which was properly folded but failed to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)), rescued the depression phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We note that WT syt 7, and the 4D/N mutant, were both present in synapses but were not well colocalized with the SV marker, synapsin, as compared to syt 1 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The surface fractions, as well as the internal fractions, were similar between syt 1 and 7 measured by using a pHluorin tag (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), consistent with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dean et al., 2012a</a>)."

Remarkably, when applied to WT hippocampal neurons, a CaM antagonist precisely phenocopies the defects in SV replenishment apparent in KO neurons.

In that study, there was a slight reduction in synaptic transmission in KO neurons during high, but not low, frequency stimulation, suggestive of a defect in replenishment. This effect was less pronounced as compared to our observations; the reasons for this difference are unknown, but might involve differences between the inhibitory and excitatory neurons used in these studies. Moreover, a more recent report from the same group (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bacaj et al., 2013</a>), using a KD approach, reached the contradictory conclusion that syt 7 plays a role in asynchronous evoked release. However, loss of syt 7, by either KD or KO, had no effect on asynchronous release (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maximov et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bacaj et al., 2013</a>); the only case where a loss of release was observed was when syt 7 was knocked down (and not knocked out) in a syt 1 KO background. So, the physiological relevance of this observation is unclear. Moreover, in <a href=\"#bib1\">Bacaj et al. (2013)</a>, there was, again, a reduction in release only at late, but not early stages, in the stimulus train in KO neurons. We argue that this result should be interpreted as defective SV replenishment, because loss of asynchronous release should occur for all evoked responses, early and late. Furthermore, impaired replenishment of large dense core vesicles (LDCV) was also reported in KO chromaffin cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schonn et al., 2008</a>), consistent with our current study. Thus, syt 7 might serve as a ubiquitous Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for replenishment of vesicles, including LDCVs and SVs."

These findings raise the possibility that syt 7 may be targeted to, and thereby act at the plasma membrane, as proposed by <a href=\"#bib41a\">Sugita et al. (2001)</a>, to drive replenishment by either conveying SVs from reserve pools to the RRP (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kuromi and Kidokoro, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Murthy and Stevens, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ikeda and Bekkers, 2009</a>), or clearing vesicle release sites (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kawasaki et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Neher, 2010</a>). Using a pHluorin tag, we found that syt 1 and 7 have similar cell surface fractions; while significant levels of each protein are present in the plasma membrane, the largest pools of syt 7 and syt 1 are on internal organelles that acidify (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), consistent with earlier work localizing syt 7 to LDCVs and lysosomes in neuroendocrine cells and cells in the immune system (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fukuda et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Czibener et al., 2006</a>). Clearly, syt 7 is not selectively targeted to the plasma membrane (though, again, like all syt isoforms, some fraction is present in the plasma membrane [<a href=\"#bib8\">Dean et al., 2012a</a>]). Moreover, pHluorin-syt 7 does not recycle with SV-like kinetics, even after repetitive stimulation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dean et al., 2012a</a>), excluding the possibility that syt 7 traffics to SVs before, during, or after stimulation.

The analyses rely almost completely on a physiological characterization of synaptotagmin VII knockout mice, and data interpretation is greatly aided by the selective effect with no observable change in the response to a single action potential or pool size. In addition, the results are consistent with previous work showing little effect of SytVII on synaptic transmission. An important element of this study is the experiments to rescue the defect with either wild type SytVII or with a mutant version of SytVII that lacks calcium binding (4D/N). An analysis of recovery from depression supports the conclusion that SytVII is required for the fast phase of vesicle recovery, a deficit of \u223c50% is resolved. In general, the experiments are nicely performed and clearly documented."

The authors suggest that the known role of syt VII in dense core vesicle release may contribute, presumably by releasing a factor that influences synaptic vesicle recycling. However, the loss of syt VII does not eliminate regulated exocytosis of chromaffin granules, and it is harder to understand how a partial defect would produce this effect on synaptic transmission, particularly since the defect occurs as early as the second action potential in a train. This issue lies at the very heart of this study. As such, this issue has to be introduced in the Introduction and should be clearly and openly discussed. In addition, the authors should attempt additional experimentation to confirm that SytVII does indeed reside on an internal membrane and provide further experimentation to address how SytVII could specifically influence recovery. The interation with calmodulin is interesting, but it remains a protein interaction without a clearly understood relevance to vesicle recovery."
