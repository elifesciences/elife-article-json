Ammonium uptake is mediated by ammonium transporters, whose regulation is poorly understood. While transport can easily be characterized in heterologous systems, measuring transporter activity in vivo remains challenging. Here we developed a simple assay for monitoring activity in vivo by inserting circularly-permutated GFP into conformation-sensitive positions of two plant and one yeast ammonium transceptors (\u2018AmTrac\u2019 and \u2018MepTrac\u2019). Addition of ammonium to yeast cells expressing the sensors triggered concentration-dependent fluorescence intensity (FI) changes that strictly correlated with the activity of the transporter. Fluorescence-based activity sensors present a novel technology for monitoring the interaction of the transporters with their substrates, the activity of transporters and their regulation in vivo, which is particularly valuable in the context of analytes for which no radiotracers exist, as well as for cell-specific and subcellular transport processes that are otherwise difficult to track."

Ammonium uptake is mediated by ammonium transporters, whose regulation is poorly understood. While transport can easily be characterized in heterologous systems, measuring transporter activity in vivo remains challenging. Here we developed a simple assay for monitoring activity in vivo by inserting circularly-permutated GFP into conformation-sensitive positions of two plant and one yeast ammonium transceptors (\u2018AmTrac\u2019 and \u2018MepTrac\u2019). Addition of ammonium to yeast cells expressing the sensors triggered concentration-dependent fluorescence intensity (FI) changes that strictly correlated with the activity of the transporter. Fluorescence-based activity sensors present a novel technology for monitoring the interaction of the transporters with their substrates, the activity of transporters and their regulation in vivo, which is particularly valuable in the context of analytes for which no radiotracers exist, as well as for cell-specific and subcellular transport processes that are otherwise difficult to track."

High levels of ammonium can be toxic, so all organisms need to control their uptake or excretion of this substance. Ammonium transporters, which are highly conserved from bacteria to plants to humans, are essential for this process but, along with transporters in general, they are hard to study. Their activity can be examined in vitro by expressing them in heterologous systems\u2014that is, in cells other than those in which they are naturally found. But in vivo studies must rely on indirect techniques such as monitoring radioactive isotopes or membrane potentials, and these cannot distinguish between the activity of ammonium transporters and uptake of ammonium through other routes."

This is GFP in which parts of the amino acid sequence have been rearranged without fundamentally changing the overall structure or function of the protein. Circularly permutated GFP can be fused to another protein in such a way that a conformational change in the second protein triggers a change in fluorescence that can be detected by fluorescence spectroscopy or microscopy."

Due to their hydrophobic nature the characterization of transporters is challenging, and activity measurements typically depend on the use of radiotracers and heterologous expression systems. One of the major breakthroughs for characterizing channels has been the development of electrophysiology tools, enabling characterization of electrogenic transport in live cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Neher and Sakmann, 1992</a>). However, patch clamping has largely been limited to the analysis of processes at the cell membrane, or cells at the surface of sliced tissues. A new level of insight was provided by fluorescent proteins enabling us to observe cellular processes in living cells of intact tissues (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tsien, 2006</a>). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensors have allowed us to monitor analyte levels and dynamics in live cells with minimal invasive methods (<a href=\"#bib41\">Okumoto et al., 2012</a>). Particular FRET sensors can even be used to monitor biophysical processes such as membrane potential or tension between molecules in live cells, as well as the conversion of substrates of enzyme reactions by proteases and kinases. Yet to date, we have not been able to directly follow the activity of transporters and to monitor their regulation in vivo."

Based on the pioneering work of <a href=\"#bib32\">Miyawaki et al.

An alternative, again developed by Tsien's lab (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baird et al., 1999</a>), is the use of circularly permutated GFP variants as reporters for conformational rearrangements, which have been exploited to create sensors for small molecules such as calcium, zinc and maltose (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baird et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Marvin et al., 2011</a>). Circularly-permutated versions of GFP (cpGFP) have successfully been used to monitor structural rearrangements of calmodulin (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baird et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nagai et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Nakai et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akerboom et al., 2009</a>). cpGFP is a protein in which the \u03b2-barrel structure has been rearranged in a way that ligand-induced conformational changes can influence the chromophore environment and consequentially the fluorescent properties of a chimeric sensor. Depending on pH, GFP and its variants have two excitation maxima (\u03bb<sub>ex</sub> \u223c 395 and 475 nm) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tsien, 1998</a>). Protein-cpGFP fusions, in which structural rearrangements affect the state of the chromophore as well as the hydrogen bonds between the chromophore and the surrounding \u03b2-barrel, can in principle be exploited to develop sensors that monitor transporter activity. Here we tested the hypothesis that ammonium transporters can effectively report transporter activity in live cells when fused to cpGFP."

Recent results show that ammonium-triggered phosphorylation of a critical threonine in the cytosolic C-terminus of AMT1;1 leads to inhibition of ammonium transport by allosteric regulation in the trimeric transporter complex (<a href=\"#bib26\">Loqu\u00e9 et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lanquar et al., 2009</a>).

Monomeric teal fluorescent protein (mTFP), Venus or a modified circularly permutated GFP (mcpGFP), which had successfully been employed to create highly sensitive, single-fluorophore sensors for calcium and maltose (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tian et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Marvin et al., 2011</a>), were inserted into intracellular loops of AMT1;3. The functionality of the transporter fusions was tested by complementation of ammonium uptake deficiency in a yeast mutant lacking endogenous ammonium transporters (<a href=\"#bib28\">Marini et al., 1997</a>). AMT1;3 activity was extremely sensitive to manipulation of loops 7\u20138 and 9\u201310 or the cytosolic C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, modification of loop 5\u20136 (L5\u20136, position K233) by insertion of either two amino acid residues (encoded as part of the restriction site <i>XbaI</i>) or mcpGFP was tolerated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In contrast, mTFP or Venus insertions inhibited transport activity. Interestingly, L5\u20136 is located between the two pseudo-symmetric halves of the protein and connects two transmembrane helices (TMH-V and -VI) that contain residues postulated to be directly involved in recruitment, gating and substrate translocation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andrade et al., 2005</a>).

However, it is known that the cpGFP-based sensors for calcium and maltose are exquisitely sensitive to modifications in the linker sequences connecting to the respective binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akerboom et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Marvin et al., 2011</a>). To explore whether linker modification would affect the ability of the chimera to detect structural rearrangements of AMT1;3 during transport, we created 24 variants by altering the linkers connecting AMT1;3 and mcpGFP, exploiting information generated during optimization of calcium and maltose sensors (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akerboom et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Marvin et al., 2011</a>). All 24 variants maintained transport activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>); importantly some variants showed a FI response to addition of 1 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The variant showing the strongest response (40% FI change) was named AmTrac (Ammonium Transporter coupled to mcpGFP). In AmTrac, mcpGFP had been inserted into position 233 of AMT1;3, centrally located in the cytosolic loop L5\u20136 and flanked via linker sequences containing Leu-Glu and Phe-Asn at the N- and C-terminus, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). To explore the tolerance of L5\u20136 of AMT1;3 to mcpGFP insertion, we varied the insertion position in the loop (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Both transport activity and fluorescence response were highest in variants with mcpGFP inserted in central positions of L5\u20136, with a clear correlation between activity and FI change (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Loop length also proved to be critical. In variants with incremental deletions in the middle of L5\u20136 around the insertion point of mcpGFP, deletion of four or more residues abolished transport activity and the fluorescence response (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Importantly, all variants that responded to ammonium with a FI change were functional transporters, indicating that AmTrac reports transport activity. Fluorescent variants that were able to mediate transport but showed no FI change (such as AMT1;3-mcpGFP-233) were used as control sensors to exclude potential effects of other parameters such as intracellular ammonium, proton accumulation or depolarization on the FI change."

To test the reversibility of the sensor response directly, we recorded the FI of single cells trapped in a microfluidic device and exposed to ammonium pulses. AmTrac responses were detectable in single cells, were concentration-dependent, and were readily reversible, demonstrating that AmTrac can be used in vivo to quantify ammonium transport activity and to observe kinetics of the chimeric transporter in response to substrate availability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

To create sensors with enhanced SNR, we randomly substituted residues in the two-amino acid linker directly preceding mcpGFP. We identified AmTrac versions that maintained transport activity and showed high FI and a large ammonium-induced FI response. Interestingly, the majority of the brightest variants carried a Ser residue instead of a Glu in the position immediately preceding the mcpGFP insertion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). AmTrac-LS, a sensor with a Leu-Ser linker, was as responsive to ammonium as AmTrac (\u223c40% FI change), but was approximately fivefold brighter (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of intact yeast cells expressing the improved variant AmTrac-LS were recorded. The excitation spectra revealed two maxima, a minor peak of the protonated chromophore at \u03bb<sub>ex</sub> \u223c 380 nm and a major peak of the deprotonated chromophore at \u03bb<sub>ex</sub> \u223c 495 nm. For the emission spectra one maximum was detected at \u03bb<sub>em</sub> \u223c 513 nm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The spectra are similar to those reported for unmodified EGFP.

While these mutations did not affect plasma membrane localization of AmTrac (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), both transport activity and fluorescence response were abolished (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>), indicating that transport activity is tightly correlated with the FI response of AmTrac. Alternatively, accumulation of intracellular ammonium, and not its transport, could affect mcpGFP fluorescence. Since the <i>\u0394mep1,2,3</i> yeast strain lacks endogenous ammonium transporters, ammonium uptake in these cells depends on episomally expressed transporters. AmTrac mutants unable to transport ammonium also prevent intracellular ammonium accumulation. To discriminate between the hypotheses that AmTrac reports conformational states of the transporter or responds to accumulation of ammonium in the cytosol, AmTrac and AmTrac-D202N, -G460D, -T464D mutants were expressed in wild type yeast carrying endogenous ammonium transporters (MEPs; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In the presence of an independent set of functional ammonium transporters, none of the transport-deficient AmTrac versions produced an FI response (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), providing strong evidence that cytosolic ammonium accumulation did not elicit the FI response. As a further test, generation of intracellular ammonium from arginine catabolism (<a href=\"#bib28\">Marini et al., 1997</a>) failed to trigger an AmTrac response (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Taken together, these results indicate that AmTrac responds to extracellular and not intracellular ammonium levels. However our data do not exclude the possibility that other mutations can uncouple of the two processes, that is, to generate a protein that responds with a FI change to addition of ammonium but is unable to mediate transport across the membrane."

Phylogenetic analyses place AMT1;3 and AMT1;2 into the same subfamily. Yeast MEPs belong to a distantly related clade; and MEP2 and AMT1;3 share only 22% identity at the protein level. Notwithstanding, insertion of mcpGFP in the center of L5\u20136 of both AMT1;2 and MEP2 (after amino acids R242 and R217, respectively) with the same linkers as in AmTrac-LS, generated two functional sensors (named AmTrac1;2 and MepTrac) that maintained transport activity (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>) and responded to ammonium addition with a fluorescence change (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). The original MepTrac showed only a low response when tested at pH 6. In contrast to AMTs, MEP2 has a pH optimum at low pH. Histidine-194 in the pore of MEP2 has been shown to be responsible for the lower pH optimum (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boeckstaens et al., 2008</a>). A variant of MepTrac carrying the H194E mutation showed a significantly increased FI response, in agreement with the broader pH optimum conferred by this mutation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boeckstaens et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Similar to AmTrac, the response of AmTrac1;2, MepTrac and MepTrac-H194E to ammonium addition were dose-dependent. It is noteworthy that the AmTrac1;2 and MepTrac sensors were generated in a single step by using the linker and position information acquired during AmTrac development. We hypothesize that based on these results it will be possible to convert other transporters with similar twofold pseudo-symmetry into activity state sensors as well (<a href=\"#bib10\">Forrest, 2013</a>)."

They offer new tools for genetic screens, for example, for identifying regulatory networks, or they can be used for screening chemical libraries to identify new drugs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bermejo et al., 2013</a>). The existing tools, that is, FRET sensors for small molecules allow us to monitor steady state levels and dynamic changes of analytes such as ions, signaling compounds, metabolites and substrates of proteases (<a href=\"#bib41\">Okumoto et al., 2012</a>). Combined with information on the cellular and subcellular localization of receptors, enzymes and transporters, they can be used to obtain a first picture of the signaling and metabolic networks. However, tools for measuring the activity of transporters in vivo have been limited to electrophysiology, which can not differentiate between transporter isoforms, and is difficult to use for measuring transporter activity in cells in live tissues or even subcellular compartments. Here we developed a prototype for such activity sensors using the important class of ammonium transporters conserved from archaebacteria to higher plants and metazoa, including the human Rhesus factors. We made use of the effect of conformational rearrangements in AMTs/MEPs transceptors on the fluorescence emitted by circularly permutated mcpGFPs that have been inserted into an intracellular loop of the transporters. These fluorescence-based sensors report the activity of the transporter in vivo and can be used to quantify the activity of a specific transporter in vivo. Information on the activity of transporters is relevant for determining the regulation of individual isoforms in live cells, to identify and characterize regulators, to monitor transport in cells otherwise inaccessible to transport measurements, and to characterize subcellular transport processes in living tissues. At the same time these novel sensors may help to record structural rearrangements that occur when transporter bind their ligands or which occur during the transport cycle. We show here that, in contrast to the interpretation of results from crystallization studies (<a href=\"#bib18\">Khademi et al., 2004</a>), AMTs and MEPs both change conformation during transport, and thus most probably do not function as \u2018passive gas channels\u2019. The nature of the conformational changes, which here are monitored in ensembles, will require crystallization of the transporter in different states, as recently achieved for a variety of transporters (<a href=\"#bib11\">Forrest and Rudnick, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Shimamura et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Jiang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</a>)."

The characteristics of the AmTrac fluorescence response, namely (i) the indistinguishable transport and fluorescence response kinetics, (ii) the reversibility, (iii) the tight link between transport activity for the FI response, (iv) the correlated shifts in affinity for ammonium transport and FI response, and (v) the restoration of the FI response by reconstitution of transport activity in suppressor mutants, strongly indicate that AmTrac sensors measure processes that occur during the transport cycle, or are intimately and quantitatively connected to transport activity. Since binding of the substrate to the transporter is part of the transport cycle, our data do not exclude the possibility that the sensors report extracellular binding of ammonium and therefore measure extracellular ammonium levels rather than activity."

Other transporters with a dual function as transporters and signaling proteins include UhpT from <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schw\u00f6ppe et al., 2003</a>), Pho84p and GAP1p from <i>Saccharomyces</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Thevelein and Voordeckers, 2009</a>) and Chl1 from Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ho et al., 2009</a>). The mechanism by which signaling is transmitted is unclear, specifically how substrate binding or conformational rearrangements during the transport cycle are necessary for triggering the receptor activity. Recent work by the Thevelein group has shed some light on the relative role of binding vs transport in this process. Some transporter-like receptors, such as the glucose transporter-like SNF3p and RGT1p from <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, appear to be unable to transport, suggesting that binding is sufficient for triggering a conformational rearrangement that is detected by intracellular signaling proteins (<a href=\"#bib48\">Thevelein and Voordeckers, 2009</a>). The yeast Pho84 phosphate transceptor functions both in phosphate transport and mediates activation of the protein kinase A pathway. The finding that phosphate analogs that do not appear to be transported retain signaling activity is consistent with the hypothesis that a complete transport cycle is not required for signaling. However, further analyses suggested that ligand binding is insufficient for signaling, therefore the authors concluded the receptor activity is triggered by specific conformational rearrangements that occur during a specific phase of the transport cycle (<a href=\"#bib43\">Popova et al., 2010</a>). Mutations in the presumed proton-binding site severely reduced transport but not signaling, demonstrating that transport and signaling activities are separable (<a href=\"#bib45\">Samyn et al., 2012</a>). Combined analysis of the action of amino acid analogs and mutagenesis of the putative binding site of the amino acid transceptor GAP1 on transport and signaling have indicated that, similar as in PHO84, signaling requires a ligand-induced conformational change that corresponds to a step in the transport cycle but does not appear to require a the full cycle (<a href=\"#bib55\">Van Zeebroeck et al., 2009</a>). It is therefore conceivable that the fluorescent change observed in the fluorescent ammonium sensors presented here is due to either (i) ammonium binding, (ii) a specific set of steps in the transport cycle, or (iii) the full transport cycle of the transporter."

The combination of two ammonium transport activity sensors from different organisms will be useful for dissecting endogenous control mechanisms, because heterologous proteins are not expected to be subject to the same regulatory control and can thus serve as references. As a next step, we will deploy AmTrac and MepTrac in both Arabidopsis roots and in yeast to study their regulation in vivo and to identify regulators. The measurement of flux through a transporter by reporting state changes, as shown here, might be applicable to other transporters or enzymes for monitoring in vivo fluxes, for example, in the context of neurotransmission. Such in vivo flux analyses will aid in understanding the mode of action of proteins and may serve as tools for drug discovery."

Since NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is a key substrate in plant physiology, these reporters represent an important technical advance. Despite the fact that the reviewers are not convinced that the sensors report transport as opposed to binding, they feel that the approach and the ability to report NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentration represent an important advance.

Other transporters that may have a dual function as transporters and signaling proteins include UhpT from <i>E. coli</i> (Schw\u00f6ppe, 2003), Pho84p and GAP1p from <i>Saccharomyces</i> (Thevelein, 2009) and Chl1 from Arabidopsis (Ho, 2009). The mechanism of the receptor function is unclear, specifically whether substrate binding or conformational rearrangements during the transport cycle are necessary for triggering the receptor activity. Recent work by the Thevelein group has shed some light on the relative role of binding versus transport in this process. Some transporter-like receptors, such as the glucose transporter-like SNF3p and RGT1p from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, appear to be unable to transport, suggesting that binding is sufficient for triggering a conformational rearrangement that is detected by intracellular signaling proteins (Thevelein, 2009). The yeast Pho84 phosphate transceptor functions both transport as phosphate transporter and mediates activation of the protein kinase A pathway. The use of phosphate analogs which do not appear to be transported retain signaling activity, consistent with the hypothesis that for signaling to occur, a complete transport cycle is not required. However, further analyses suggested that ligand binding is insufficient for signaling, therefore the authors concluded the receptor activity is triggered by specific conformational rearrangements that occur during a specific phase of the transport cycle (Popova, 2010). Mutations in the presumed proton-binding site severely reduced transport but not signaling, demonstrating that transport and signaling activities are separable (Samyn, 2012). Combined analysis of the action of amino acid analogs and mutagenesis of the putative binding site of the amino acid transceptor GAP1 on transport and signaling have indicated that, similar as in PHO84, signaling requires a ligand-induced conformational change that corresponds to a step in the transport cycle but may not the full cycle (Van Zeebroeck, 2009).\u201d"
