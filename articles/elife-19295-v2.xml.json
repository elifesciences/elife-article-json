The experiments reveal that inhibitory inputs play an important role in controlling the activity of neurons in the cochlear nucleus. By decreasing the neurons\u2019 activity, inhibitory inputs allow these cells to respond to many different levels of sound, from very loud to very quiet. The experiments also show that excitatory and inhibitory inputs are triggered by similar sounds so that the two processes quickly balance each other. This means that the brain is equally able to work out where a sound is coming from regardless of whether it is loud or quiet."

In cortical processing, the dominant excitatory neurons interact reciprocally with inhibitory neurons, which serve key functions in shaping the responses (reviewed in\u00a0<a href=\"#bib53\">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</a>). In the auditory cortex, recent work has emphasized the role of inhibition in dynamically balancing excitation via a high degree of co-tuning (e.g. <a href=\"#bib126\">Wehr and Zador, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Renart et al., 2010</a>) that serves to shape and accelerate network dynamics. Similarly, in other modalities, inhibition was found to be co-tuned with excitation in the cortex, typically with a wider tuning, generating the well-described inhibitory sidebands (auditory: <a href=\"#bib123\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib131\">Wu et al., 2008</a>, visual: <a href=\"#bib113\">Sohya et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Niell and Stryker, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Liu et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib75\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Katzner et al., 2011</a>, olfactory: <a href=\"#bib97\">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</a>). Temporally, inhibition often follows excitation closely (auditory: <a href=\"#bib126\">Wehr and Zador, 2003</a>, somatosensory: <a href=\"#bib128\">Wilent and Contreras, 2004</a>)."

This enabled a direct assessment of the input-output function under the condition of acoustic stimulation, also in combination with pharmacological manipulations. The respective experiments revealed a slight increase in temporal precision of signal coding, attributed to the influence of acoustically evoked inhibition (<a href=\"#bib28\">Dehmel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Kuenzel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Keine and R\u00fcbsamen, 2015</a>). It may be argued that the stimulus conditions employed were rather static and did not adequately reflect the challenge of processing the dynamics of spectrotemporal complex acoustic signals. While fast inhibition in T stellate cells has been attributed to a role in comodulation masking release (<a href=\"#bib99\">Pressnitzer et al., 2001</a>), the inhibitory dynamics in SBCs seem to be too slow for such an effect (<a href=\"#bib133\">Xie and Manis, 2013</a>).

Our results indicate a reliable co-tuning of inhibition with the main excitatory input. While we observed some sharpening of the response in time and frequency, our results suggest that inhibition functions as a gain control that renders the postsynaptic response sparser in time and more reproducible across trials. Temporal sparsity, i.e. a response restricted to fewer time-points, can increase the information per spike while reducing the energy expenditure. Reproducibility, i.e. a more consistent response to identical stimuli, can provide reliable stimulus encoding."

The divisive component acts primarily as a gain control, which - in conjunction with the co-tuning - maintains the SBC output rate in a smaller range across different stimulus levels. Together these two effects focus the SBC output onto well-timed stimulus events across a wide range of stimulus levels.

For each unit, the EPSP rising slopes were pooled for EPSP<sub>succ\u00a0</sub>and EPSP<sub>fail</sub> and binned. Then, the fraction of EPSP<sub>succ</sub> was calculated for each bin, and a Boltzmann function was fitted to the EPSP<sub>succ</sub> probability distribution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> left). The symmetric inflection point of this function indicates the threshold EPSP, i.e. the EPSP slope necessary to trigger an AP with\u00a0&gt;50% probability. EPSP rising slopes showed strong depression for inter-event intervals (IEI)\u00a0&lt;\u00a02 ms resulting in high AP failure rates. But, already for IEIs\u00a0&gt;\u00a05 ms, the preceding activity had only a minor influence on EPSP rising slopes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, middle). Averaging the normalized EPSP slopes across cells showed a facilitating effect for IEI between 2 ms and 20 ms (green markers, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> right).

While IEIs up to 20\u00a0ms resulted in increased EPSP slopes, the effect of IEIs on threshold EPSP and failure fraction was limited to short IEIs\u00a0&lt;\u00a02 ms. These data are consistent with previous studies, suggesting the presence of short-term facilitation rather than depression of synaptic events. Considering only the last preceding IEI, however, disregards the potential impact of previous medium- and short-term afferent activity.

In vitro studies and modeling suggested inhibition to prevent AP generation in SBC by elevating the threshold EPSP (<a href=\"#bib133\">Xie and Manis, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Kuenzel et al., 2015</a>). Slice studies reported a predominately glycinergic inhibition with a smaller GABAergic contribution (<a href=\"#bib88\">Nerlich et al., 2014a</a>, <a href=\"#bib89\">2014b</a>), and in vivo studies showed an effective, dose-dependent block of SBC spiking by iontophoretic application of glycine (<a href=\"#bib61\">Keine and R\u00fcbsamen, 2015</a>). Consequently, we tested if the activation of glycinergic inputs can directly cause the observed elevation of threshold EPSP. Glycine was applied iontophoretically, mimicking the putative role of glycinergic inhibition, while monitoring the SBC\u2019s spontaneous activity. Indeed, glycine caused an increase in the number of EPSPs that failed to trigger APs, and this specific effect could be blocked by simultaneous application of the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The iontophoretic current for glycine application was adjusted to cause an increase in the spontaneous failure fraction from 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17 to 0.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 (\u0394\u00a0=\u00a00.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12, p&lt;0.001, paired <i>t</i>-test, n\u00a0=\u00a011, U1\u00a0=\u00a00.5) to match the range observed under acoustic stimulation. This increase in failure fraction was accompanied by an elevation in threshold EPSP (threshold EPSP spont\u00a0=\u00a06.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2 V/s vs threshold EPSP glycine\u00a0=\u00a08.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8 V/s, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a02.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 V/s, p&lt;0.001, paired <i>t</i>-test, n\u00a0=\u00a011, U1\u00a0=\u00a00.32, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, see also <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>).

The specific glycine receptor antagonist strychnine was iontophoretically applied to block the acoustically evoked glycinergic inhibition. The effectiveness of the glycine block was tested before sound stimulation by simultaneously applying glycine and strychnine, with the application current for strychnine adjusted to block the effect of iontophoretically applied glycine. The ANF input firing rates were not influenced by the block of inhibition (control\u00a0=\u00a0282\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048 Hz vs. strychnine\u00a0=\u00a0283\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050 Hz, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a01.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.7 Hz, p=0.88, paired <i>t</i>-test, n\u00a0=\u00a011, U1\u00a0=\u00a00.18, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The SBC output rates in the excitatory field, however, were substantially increased under glycine block (control =\u00a0122\u00a0\u00b1\u00a049 Hz vs. strychnine\u00a0=\u00a0192\u00a0\u00b1\u00a039 Hz, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a070\u00a0\u00b1\u00a047.9 Hz, p&lt;0.001, paired <i>t</i>-test, n\u00a0=\u00a011, U1\u00a0=\u00a00.5, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We next tested if the block of glycinergic inhibition differentially affects the threshold EPSP during spontaneous activity and during acoustic stimulation.

The SBC output exhibited consistently higher VS compared to its ANF input (\u0394\u00a0=\u00a00.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04, p&lt;0.001, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n\u00a0=\u00a014, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.09, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, see also <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>), and decreased for modulation frequencies above 200 Hz (factor frequency: p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.09; interaction signal type \u00d7 frequency: p&lt;0.05, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n\u00a0=\u00a014). To estimate the degree of modulation of the neural response, the modulation depth was estimated by calculating the standard deviation of the first cycle of the normalized cross-correlation function. Modulation depth was considerably higher at the SBC output (\u0394\u00a0=\u00a00.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04, p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.09) and decreased with modulation frequency (factor frequency: p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.08; interaction signal type \u00d7 frequency: p=0.12, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n\u00a0=\u00a014)."

For that purpose, the stimulus intensity was fixed at 30\u201340 dB above the unit\u2019s threshold and the stimulus frequency modulated between one octave below and two octaves above the unit\u2019s CF. This frequency range covers the whole excitatory area as well as the inhibitory sideband. Similar to the SAM stimulation, the SFM resulted in prominent modulations of the units\u2019 firing rates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and increased failure fractions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) (spont\u00a0=\u00a00.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25 vs. stim\u00a0=\u00a00.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a00.26\u00a00.23, p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.29, data not shown). In contrast to SAM stimulation, SFM led to increased failure rates at higher modulation frequencies (e.g. 0.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13 at 20 Hz vs. 0.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12 at 400 Hz modulation frequency, p&lt;0.001, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.02, n\u00a0=\u00a019, data not shown). For SFM stimulation \u2013 same as for SAM - the SBC output showed higher VS compared to their ANF input (\u0394\u00a0=\u00a00.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09, p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.21, see also <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> left) (factor frequency: p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.48; interaction signal type \u00d7 frequency: p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.03, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n\u00a0=\u00a019). Still, overall the VS of ANF input and SBC output decreased with increasing modulation frequency (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> left). Notably, the VS of the SBC output deteriorated to a lesser degree than the ANF input. At modulation frequencies of 20 Hz, the output VS was not significantly different between ANF input and SBC output (ANF input\u00a0=\u00a00.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 vs. SBC output\u00a0=\u00a00.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a00.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07, p=0.17, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted, n\u00a0=\u00a019, U1\u00a0=\u00a00.16). For modulation frequencies of 400 Hz, however, the VS of the SBC output was considerably higher than the ANF input (ANF input\u00a0=\u00a00.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08 vs. SBC output 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a00.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06, p&lt;0.001, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted, n\u00a0=\u00a019, U1\u00a0=\u00a00.5). It has to be considered that the interpretation of VS values is difficult when the period histogram of the neuronal response shows multiple peaks (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We, therefore, used a set of additional measures to describe the neuronal response to SFM stimuli when comparing ANF input and SBC output. The modulation depth was considerably higher for the SBC output than the ANF input (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> midleft; \u0394\u00a0=\u00a00.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16, p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.28) and strongly depended on the modulation frequency (factor frequency: p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.37; interaction signal type \u00d7 frequency: p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.03, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n\u00a0=\u00a019). The same holds for signal reproducibility (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> midright; \u0394\u00a0=\u00a01.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2, p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.38) which also showed prominent frequency dependency (factor frequency: p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.26; interaction signal type \u00d7 frequency: p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.02, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n\u00a0=\u00a019). Unlike the previous measures, the normalized correlation between SFM stimulus envelope and neural response revealed a lower reproducibility for the SBC output compared to the ANF input (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> right; \u0394\u00a0=\u00a00.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03, p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.06), and the difference also holds with respect to the effect of modulation frequency (factor frequency: p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.43; interaction signal type \u00d7 frequency: p&lt;0.001, \u03b7\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a00.03, two-way RM ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected, n\u00a0=\u00a019). Overall, these data suggest that \u2013 same as for the SAM stimuli \u2013 the SBC output shows temporally increased precision and higher response\u00a0reproducibility during SFM stimulation."

In natural environments, however, the auditory system has to cope with simultaneous dynamic changes in both frequency and amplitude embedded in ambient background noise. To mimic such conditions, while preserving the possibility for a quantifying data analysis, dynamic acoustic stimuli composed of gamma-tones randomly placed in the spectrogram were used (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> top, randomized gamma-tone sequence, RGS, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for details). The SBC activity can then be characterized using spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs). In the present context, STRFs can also be used to quantify the spectrotemporal transformation of response properties across the ANF-SBC synapse, since the respective analysis can be performed for both the ANF input and SBC output. SBC activity was recorded while presenting 20\u201330 repetitions of identically structured RGS sequences of 30 s duration each.

This normalization allows a quantification of changes in the tuning shape. The increase in EPSP<sub>fail</sub> in the STRF of the SBC output manifests itself as a broad field of negativity in the difference-STRF around CF extending up to\u00a0~10 ms after the onset of the effective signal components around 2 kHz. The respective differences between ANF input and SBC output were quantified in all recorded SBCs (n\u00a0=\u00a034) separately for the positive (red) and negative (blue) regions in the STRF (corresponding to influential spectrotemporal locations in the stimulus prior to the response).

The latter can diversely shape the response properties, by reducing responses only for small, off-CF regions. Co-tuned inhibition, on the other hand, has been proposed to contribute to a precisely timed balancing of excitation to keep neurons within their dynamic ranges (<a href=\"#bib100\">Renart et al., 2010</a>). To test for such a mechanism, we quantified properties of the SBC output in comparison to the ANF input with respect to the temporal sparsity of the response and reproducibility across trials. Efficient neural codes have been proposed to show high sparsity, i.e. respond only rarely but then with high firing activity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Field, 1994</a>). Again, the RGS stimulus was used to test the effect of acoustically evoked inhibition under complex acoustic conditions.

Response reproducibility across trials renders the response more identifiable for downstream processing stages which rely on precisely timed inputs.

Like in the experiments reported above, the analysis differentiated between the ANF input to SBCs and the respective SBC output. Under control conditions, cells showed the above-described increase in sparsity and reproducibility at the ANF-to-SBC transition. Blocking the glycinergic inhibition resulted in decreased sparsity of the SBC output (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8Aiv</a>; control\u00a0=\u00a00.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 vs. strychnine\u00a0=\u00a00.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a00.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06, p&lt;0.01, two-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni\u2013adjusted, n\u00a0=\u00a012, U1\u00a0=\u00a00.33).

In comparison with the pre-post data, the pharmacological dataset shows smaller variability across cells, which may be due to the lack of outliers in the latter, smaller dataset. In summary, these data directly show that glycinergic inhibition is a critical factor for the observed improvements from ANF input to the SBC output during complex acoustic stimulation."

While hyperpolarization has been attributed to a\u00a0subtractive effect on firing rates (<a href=\"#bib30\">Doiron et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Silver, 2010</a>), shunting inhibition has mainly divisive effects (<a href=\"#bib84\">Mitchell and Silver, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Prescott and De Koninck, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Capaday and van Vreeswijk, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Ly and Doiron, 2009</a>). We investigated the functional effect of either type on the response via a simple simulation: either a fixed fraction (divisive, relative to the instantaneous firing rate) or a fixed number (subtractive) of spikes was removed from the ANF spike trains, matching the experimentally observed SBC output rates. Purely divisive inhibition, corresponding to a scaling of the PSTH, does not improve sparsity, reproducibility or temporal precision (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, purple, \u0394sparsity\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00, p=0.99, \u0394reproducibility\u00a0=\u00a00.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02, p=0.25, \u0394temporal dispersion\u00a0=\u00a00.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.41, p=0.89, n\u00a0=\u00a034, one-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted, see also <a href=\"#SD9-data\">Figure 9\u2014source data 1</a>).

Quantitatively, the simulated subtractive inhibition leads to larger improvements in sparsity and reproducibility than observed in the experimental data (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, blue, sparsity: data\u00a0=\u00a00.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13 vs. subtractive inhibition\u00a0=\u00a00.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a00.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07, p&lt;0.001; reproducibility: data\u00a0=\u00a00.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.61 vs. subtractive inhibition\u00a0=\u00a01.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9, \u0394\u00a0=\u00a00.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6, p&lt;0.001, n\u00a0=\u00a034, one-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni-adjusted).

Therefore, we propose glycinergic inhibition to take a functional role as a gain control and a signal quality enhancer, which optimizes the SBC output for the subsequent high-fidelity integration for sound localization in the MSO and LSO (see below)."

The present in vivo recordings showed that the increased failure fraction during acoustic stimulation cannot be explained by synaptic depression alone. This was evidenced by an analysis of EPSP thresholds and furthermore confirmed by iontophoretic application of a glycine receptor agonist and antagonist. In conclusion, the elevation of the EPSP threshold has proven to be a reliable indicator for inhibitory action, leading to an increased failure fraction. These data are consistent with previous in vivo studies (<a href=\"#bib67\">Kuenzel et al., 2011</a>), as well as with slice and model studies demonstrating that an increase in inhibitory conductance can elevate threshold EPSP in bushy cells (<a href=\"#bib133\">Xie and Manis, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Kuenzel et al., 2015</a>). In summary, the endbulb of Held\u2013SBC synapse seems to operate close to AP threshold and shows variable reliability which is strongly influenced by acoustically evoked inhibition (see also <a href=\"#bib65\">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Kuenzel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Keine and R\u00fcbsamen, 2015</a>).

Therefore, we focused on the modulation of glycinergic inhibition. The applied dose was equated to match the acoustically evoked level of AP failures, keeping inhibition in the physiologically relevant range. This cautious approach will tend to underestimate the in vivo effect of glycine since the block of glycine receptors by local application of strychnine might be incomplete. Consistent with the slice data, the lack\u00a0of threshold EPSP\u00a0elevation during the block of glycinergic inhibition suggests only a minor influence of the GABAergic component during tone burst stimulation. The GABAergic inhibition might have an additional modulatory function or may only be activated during periods of high activity, as has been suggested for the glycinergic inhibition in the bird\u2019s nucleus magnocellularis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Fischl et al., 2014</a>), the avian homolog of the AVCN. Overall, we find glycine to have a substantial influence in shaping transmission at the SBC junction.

Reproducibility will\u00a0also be increased if the average temporal precision of high peaks is greater than the bulk of spikes at lower firing rates.

This is relevant for downstream cells, who can then combine information more efficiently with other inputs, to achieve higher precision, e.g. for estimating interaural time delays. Second, since the SBC\u2019s response occurs on a reduced plateau of unmodulated firing than the ANF\u2019s, changes in firing rate will lead to larger relative changes in firing rate, which should improve their detection in the target neurons. Avoiding saturating or strongly adapting postsynaptic responses also supports this improvement in change detectability (<a href=\"#bib85\">Mitchison and Durbin, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Graham and Willshaw, 1997</a>).

Recent developments in STRF estimation (<a href=\"#bib117\">Theunissen et al., 2001</a>) make them a versatile tool to study the combined spectrotemporal stimulus selectivity of neurons for a wide range of acoustic stimuli. The present extension to pre- and postsynaptic activity is unique and provides a direct estimate of the spectrotemporal response modification occurring at a single endbulb synapse. It reveals inhibition to be co-tuned with excitation, but outlasting the latter, which \u2013 in total \u2013 leads to a slightly improved excitatory response precision. This response profile directly confirms the spectral properties gained from the pure-tone tuning curves and is in agreement with findings from of our previous studies on inhibition at the SBC (<a href=\"#bib61\">Keine and R\u00fcbsamen, 2015</a>). The pre-post STRF analysis could provide a generally applicable tool for the investigation of a wider range of modulations of signal processing at the giant synapses in both MNTB and AVCN, for example the functional differences on synaptic transmission under the stimulation with natural acoustic stimuli or removal/application of specific neurotransmitters, e.g. GABA (<a href=\"#bib89\">Nerlich et al., 2014b</a>) or neuromodulators, e.g. acetylcholine (<a href=\"#bib44\">Goyer et al., 2016</a>)."

In a recent study, <a href=\"#bib20\">Campagnola and Manis (2014)</a> showed directly that bushy cells receive symmetric inhibition from within the CN. Further, the\u00a0~1 ms delay of the onset of acoustically evoked inhibition compared to the onset of excitation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Kuenzel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Keine and R\u00fcbsamen, 2015</a>) suggests a single additional synaptic relay.

Signals were detected using a slope threshold for the rising flank of the EPSP. In this report, EPSPs that failed to trigger a postsynaptic AP were termed EPSP<sub>fail</sub> while EPSPs that successfully trigger an AP were termed EPSP<sub>succ</sub>. The separation between EPSP<sub>succ</sub> and EPSP<sub>fail</sub> was based on the maximum falling slope following the detection time point. The APs following EPSP<sub>succ</sub> exhibited a considerably faster-falling flank than EPSP<sub>fail</sub> enabling a clear separation of both signal types (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The detection thresholds were kept fixed for each recorded unit, but varied between units to account for different signal-to-noise ratios. For comparison of timing between EPSP<sub>succ</sub> and EPSP<sub>fail</sub>, all events were time-stamped on their respective maximum EPSP slope. Previous studies showed that the maximum slope of the EPSP is a reliable measure of EPSP strength (<a href=\"#bib67\">Kuenzel et al., 2011</a>). To determine the threshold EPSP, the maximum EPSP slopes of EPSP<sub>succ</sub> and EPSP<sub>fail</sub> were binned (bin size\u00a0=\u00a00.5 V/s), and the fraction of EPSP<sub>succ</sub> calculated for each bin. Then, a Boltzmann function of the form <math id=\"inf5\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi>\u03d5</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mrow><mo>/</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2212</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mi>a</mi></mfrac></mrow></msup></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>\u00a0was fitted to the data with each bin weighted relative to the number of events in that bin. The symmetric inflection point <i>d</i> indicates the threshold EPSP, i.e. the EPSP slope necessary to yield a\u00a0&gt;\u00a050% probability of triggering a postsynaptic AP (see also supplementary Matlab code). Earlier studies showed the influence of preceding neural activity on EPSC/EPSP and AP amplitude (<a href=\"#bib33\">Englitz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Lorteije et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib136\">Yang and Xu-Friedman, 2015</a>).

Therefore, a weighted average of all preceding events was used, with the impact dependent on the distance and EPSP slope of the respective events. The weighting was implemented as a single-exponentially decaying kernel, emphasizing temporally close events over more distant ones (<a href=\"#bib114\">Sonntag et al., 2011</a>).

The temporal precision of spikes throughout the stimulus period was assessed by calculating the vector strength (<a href=\"#bib43\">Goldberg and Brown, 1969</a>). The significance of phase-locking was tested based on the Rayleigh approximation (<a href=\"#bib81\">Mardia, 1972</a>). Vector strength is an inadequate measure if the units firing rate reproduces the stimulus modulation. Therefore, we calculated the stimulus reproduction (Corr<sub>Norm</sub>) as the normalized cross-correlation between the stimulus modulation and the respective response PSTH, adjusted for the latency of the neural response (see <a href=\"#bib119\">Tolnai et al., 2008</a>) for a detailed explanation). Note that Corr<sub>Norm</sub> is constrained to the positive range [0, 1] and an unmodulated response would yield a value of 0.82. High Corr<sub>Norm</sub> values (&gt;0.9) are only obtained when the response shape follows the stimulus envelope. The reproducibility of the neuronal responses was estimated by measuring the central peak of the shuffled autocorrelation across identical stimulus presentations (<a href=\"#bib55\">Joris et al., 2006</a>). The modulation depth of the neural response to the 100% amplitude modulation was estimated by calculating the standard deviation of the first cycle of the normalized cross-correlation function."

Specifically, we used STRFs to study the time\u00a0course of inhibition during ongoing, spectrally dispersed stimulation. Estimation of STRFs was performed using generalized reverse correlation, as described elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib118\">Theunissen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Englitz et al., 2010</a>). STRFs were estimated for both the input to the SBCs (EPSP<sub>fail</sub> + EPSP<sub>succ</sub>), as well as the SBC output (EPSP<sub>succ</sub>). Both input and output were aligned to their maximum EPSP slope, to enable a subtraction of the two STRFs using congruent reference points. STRFs were individually normalized to their standard deviation (positive peak lead normalization to very similar results), in order to allow an evaluation of tuning shape, removing the gain from overall firing rate. Without normalization, the result remains qualitatively the same. However, the inhibitory effect is then\u00a0dominated by the difference at the STRF peak, which stems from the overall firing rate difference between ANF and SBC. The resulting difference-STRF indicates the translation in spectrotemporal sensitivity from ANF input to the SBC output (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We interpret this difference to be a consequence of three factors (i) local inhibition, together with (ii) postsynaptic processes of spike-frequency adaptation and (iii) Na-channel inactivation."

Within-subject comparisons were performed by paired <i>t</i>-test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, or by multi-factorial repeated-measures (RM) ANOVA after testing for sphericity using the Mauchly test (<a href=\"#bib82\">Mauchly, 1940</a>). If the assumption of sphericity was violated, Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied. Bonferroni correction was applied to all multiple comparisons (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bonferroni, 1936</a>). Correlation between quantities was assessed by Spearman\u2019s rank correlation (<a href=\"#bib115\">Spearman, 1904</a>) to cover linear and nonlinear relationships. For interpretation of all results, a p-value less than 0.05 was deemed significant. Significance thresholds are abbreviated in figure panels as asterisks, with *, **, ***, corresponding to p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001, respectively. The effect size was calculated using the MES toolbox in Matlab (<a href=\"#bib50\">Hentschke and St\u00fcttgen, 2011</a>) and reported as eta-squared (\u03b7\u00b2) for RM ANOVA and Cohen\u2019s U1 for two-sample comparisons. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes."

To say simply that \"the functional role [of inhibition] is not entirely understood\" (Introduction section) is inadequate. In the Abstract and Introduction you suggest that one possibility is to compensate for stimulus level. The passage at the beginning of subsection \u201cInhibition at the endbulb in the context of sound localization\u201d seems important to this argument, but it is difficult to understand how sparsity enhances coincidence detection in MSO. If two inputs simply fire less, then there are fewer opportunities for coincidence, so it seems coincidence detection could get worse if the spikes are deleted at random. The authors posit that reproducibility also occurs across cells, not just within. Do the present data support that? How does level tolerance arise out of this?"

This is especially true in subsection \u201cGlycinergic inhibition renders SBC responses sparser, more reliable and temporally more precise\u201d, but even in the Abstract, these terms should be clearly defined.a) Why is kurtosis a measure of sparsity? Kurtosis seems to capture both tails of a distribution, but the term \"sparsity\" implies decreased firing generally, which would include a shift in the mean firing rate, or a skew towards longer intervals. Kurtosis, as the 4th moment, seems to be chosen to avoid both those features. Why is that? It should also be clearly explained why sparsity might be important. The argument from saving energy is not very compelling, if there is not also a decrease in firing rate.b) The term reproduction is not clear. Its definition is hidden in the Methods and while the values are compared in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, an example is not shown until <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. \"Reproduction\" has a connotation of being able to recreate something (e.g. using a response to reproduce the stimulus). However, the quantification seems to be using cross-correlation of responses. Perhaps \"reproducibility\" would be a better term for this measure, though it is important to consider that just because a response is reproducible does not mean it is correct or efficient or useful."

Why were the data not binned along the ordinate of rising slope (in 0.5 or 1 V/s bins), and the probability of success or failure computed in each bin, based on the total number of succ+fail. This would give the type of representation that would then make sense in terms of fitting to a Boltzmann to obtain a \"threshold\". Maybe do this as an inset?"

My sense is that the standard deviation would depend on whether the RLF is sampled symmetrically about a cell's dynamic range (the SD would be maximal), or asymmetrically (the SD would be lower). Please justify this measure more carefully. A more intuitive measure of flatness may be the difference in firing rate between maximum and minimum (normalized appropriately)."

It would be very helpful if the authors could take a stab at explaining how inhibition may enhance sparsity, reproduction, and temporal dispersion. In the case of sparsity, it seems like it cannot be simply a change in the mean firing rate, because kurtosis should not include that (unless there are weird effects of rectification at firing rate of 0)."

To say simply that \"the functional role [of inhibition] is not entirely understood\" (Introduction section) is inadequate. In the Abstract and Introduction you suggest that one possibility is to compensate for stimulus level. The passage at the beginning of subsection \u201cInhibition at the endbulb in the context of sound localization\u201d seems important to this argument, but it is difficult to understand how sparsity enhances coincidence detection in MSO. If two inputs simply fire less, then there are fewer opportunities for coincidence, so it seems coincidence detection could get worse if the spikes are deleted at random. The authors posit that reproducibility also occurs across cells, not just within. Do the present data support that? How does level tolerance arise out of this?</i> "

Therefore, mostly high instantaneous firing-rate events pass the junction, which often correspond to salient events in the cell's frequency range. The divisive component acts primarily as a gain control, which \u2013 in conjunction with the co-tuning \u2013 maintains the SBC output rate in a smaller range across different stimulus levels.

As the reviewers indicate, a random deletion of spikes would not lead to improved coding. Since a random deletion would correspond to a divisive scaling of the PSTH, it would also not lead to an increase in sparsity (although this would depend to some degree on the measure, see the next point). The effect of inhibition in this case is at least partially subtractive (see also #10 and #13 of the essential comments below for more details), which means that the spikes/parts of the PSTH that remain are those occurring during phases of high firing rate or high firing probabilities. These are the phases, when the stimulus drives a lot of spikes in the current frequency band/neural tuning (directly shown e.g. by the STRF tuning). For a given excitatory frequency these phases will correspond to high stimulus level (given the monotonic rate-level functions of ANFs), which are likely to be present in both the left and the right ear. We propose, that in this way, a given frequency channel transmits the most salient events in its frequency channel, which will also have the best timing (based on the general level-latency dependence (Heil and Irvine, 1997; Heil et al., 2008; Neubauer and Heil, 2008). Such an increase in temporal precision was also demonstrated before, (e.g. (Joris et al., 1994a, 1994b; Dehmel et al., 2010; Kuenzel et al., 2011) and also our <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a> and 8. Note, that due to the co-tuning of the inhibition with excitation, the strength of inhibition varies across level. Thus, across all levels the neuron\u2019s response to the <i>relatively</i> loudest peaks are kept, which is what we refer to as gain control."

MSO neurons possess a number of anatomical (Stotler, 1953; Smith, 1995; Agmon-Snir et al., 1998) and biophysical specializations (Scott et al., 2007; Mathews et al., 2010) to distinguish between monaural and binaural coincidences. The increase of ANF firing rates with sound pressure level would \u2013 at high sound intensities \u2013 likely result in a large number of coinciding inputs at the MSO level and create MSO activity at unfavorable ITDs, i.e. coincident spikes just by chance alone. The above described focus on the relatively highest-level events may allow the MSO to focus on binaural spikes with high temporal fidelity, and thus avoid inaccurate contributions to the ITD estimation. The increase of inhibition with level maintains a more limited range of firing rates across level. Given the presumably strong biophysical basis of coincidence detection in the MSO, it seems plausible that precise ITD processing can only function over a limited range of input firing frequencies. However, as intuitive as this reasoning may seem, it remains partly speculative at this point. We have added considerations along the lines above in the Discussion, adding to Discussion sections that have been added in response to other points raised by the reviewers (see section: Inhibitory mechanism for improving sparsity and reproducibility of the neural response)"

Before answering this point, we would like to make our claim more precise: If reproducibility is measured with cross-correlation at time-shift 0, an increase in reproducibility in a single cell, does not necessarily lead to an increase in reproducibility across multiple cells. Since different cells will have different tuning properties, their cross-correlation may well reduce (at time-shift 0), even if both cells individually increase their cross-correlation at time-shift 0. If cells with matched tuning properties are compared, however, an increase in reproducibility in each cell, should translate to an increase across cells. We have tested this directly for a subset of cells, identified by clearly peaked ANF cross-correlations (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 1</a>). We selected cells where identical stimulus parameters were used and in all tested cases (14 pairs of cells) the cross-correlation at time-shift 0 increased, as predicted. However, although the increase across cells was positive (0.15+/-0.18, Wilcoxon signed ranks test, p&lt;&lt;0.001) it was slightly smaller (Wilcoxon signed ranks test, p=0.03) compared to the increase within the same set of cells (0.53+/-0.41), which could be a consequence of the residual tuning mismatch between these cells."

While the current number of repetitions would make entropy estimation inaccurate (Panzeri and Treves, 1996), the general argument for an overall increase is as follows: considering the extreme case, where every cell produces an individual, but unique spike-train for a given stimulus. Then the neural population would also emit a unique population spike-train, thus be highly reproducible. Similarly, if a single cell becomes more reproducible, this reduces the set of response emitted by the entire population.

The SBCs were determined by a number of physiological properties such as high-spontaneous rates (Smith et al., 1993), localization at the rostral pole of the AVCN (Bazwinsky et al., 2008), the presence of a discernible prepotential in addition to complex waveform (Pfeiffer, 1966; Englitz et al., 2009), short AP duration (Typlt et al., 2012), and primary-like response patterns to pure-tone stimulation (Blackburn and Sachs, 1989). Based on these properties the SBCs can be reliably differentiated from the second type of principal neurons in the AVCN, the stellate cells. By considering these physiological properties, we are confident that the recorded cells were large SBCs, which have been shown to project to the MSO in cats (Osen, 1969).

The criticism of the reviewer is well taken and we not only would like to justify the approach in this letter but also explain the approach in in more detail in the text body of the manuscript. Choosing a Gaussian error function was based on a previous study (Kuenzel et al., 2011). Fitting different kinds of sigmoid functions (e.g. Boltzmann function, logistic function) resulted in different slope parameter, but identical inflection points, thus providing the same estimates for the threshold EPSP. In the original submission, we refrained from binning the rising slopes to avoid potential effects of bin size on threshold EPSP estimation. Also, in the method applied in the original manuscript, the fit is inherently weighted by the number of events, which is not the case when using binned data, as all bins will be equally weighted independent of the number of events in each bin, i.e. a probability calculated from e.g. 3 events contributes equally to the fit as does a probability calculated from 1000 events. This is why we thought the use of raw, unbinned data would provide more reliable data. However, we agree that the approach suggested by the reviewers is a more intuitive method of threshold calculation. We therefore recalculated the threshold EPSPs throughout the manuscript using the suggested method (bin size=0.5 V/s). We added a linear weighting parameter to each bin based on the number of events in each bin.

The FM stimulus spanned 3 octaves around the unit\u2019s CF, thus covering frequency areas with strong inhibition and areas lacking any inhibitory effect. The time constant of the inhibitory effect is around 20-50 ms in slice recordings (Nerlich et al., 2014), but somewhat shorter in vivo (10\u201315 ms. Nerlich et al., 2014; Keine and R\u00fcbsamen, 2015). During frequency modulated stimulation, the inhibitory conductance should therefore also be modulated and essentially act as a band-pass filter. The slowest and highest modulation frequencies might result in saturation of inhibition or insufficient activation (if the inhibitory conductance does not summate), thus reducing the inhibitory effect on the ANF-to-SBC synapse. However, the exact inhibitory dynamics in vivo are not well understood, also the combination of cell types exerting this inhibition on SBC is unclear. Hence, the temporal dynamics of inhibitory inputs during acoustic stimulation remain elusive. At this point, we can only speculate, why the effect is smaller at the highest and lowest frequencies tested, but it is tempting to argue, that the inhibitory dynamics capture the modulation rates of natural acoustic stimuli. Further studies employing natural sounds would be necessary to evaluate the inhibitory effect on different time scales."

We calculated the standard deviation across all of the sampled intensities, identically for the ANF input and the SBC output. In most cells, the RLF of the ANF input shows monotonic increase over a relative wide range of firing rates, while the RLFs of the output were more flat or even non-monotonic. A measure of monotonicity was previously suggested by Kuenzel and colleauges, (2015), which relates the maximum firing rate throughout the RLF to the firing rate obtained at highest sound intensities. While this measure is suitable for detecting non-monotonic behavior in the SBC RLF, it does not quantify the gain of neuronal response, i.e. the change in firing rate across the sound intensity. Since non-monotonic behavior of the RLF is only present in about half of the SBC (Winter and Palmer, 1990; Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2002; Keine and R\u00fcbsamen, 2015), we opted to use another measure. The original measure was normalized to the spontaneous activity and sampled identically for all cells, and thus quantifies the deviation of firing rates relative to the spontaneous activity. Still, the reviewer is right in pointing out that in the original analysis, the RLV will depend on the threshold of the neuron, i.e. for identical changes in firing rates, different measures of RLV might be obtained. While this should not pose a major problem for the comparison of ANF input and SBC output (which are both driven by the same ANF), we agree that the way the data were analyzed might be somewhat puzzling for the reader. We therefore calculated the RLV as suggested by the reviewer as the difference between minimal and maximal firing rate normalized to the spontaneous activity of ANF input and SBC output, thus providing a measure of the change in firing rates relative to spontaneous activity independent of the sampled sound intensities or the unit\u2019s threshold. Consequently, the RLV was renamed rate-level gain (RLG) throughout the manuscript. The new analysis is shown in the revised <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. Although both measures quantify somewhat different properties of the RLF, a comparison between both resulted in significant positive correlation between the two (input: rs = 0.36, p &lt; 0.01, output: rs = 0.35, p &lt; 0.01). Therefore, using the method suggested by the reviewers allows us to draw the same conclusion about the reduction in gain, but is more intuitive to the reader."

However, various studies showed, that the temporal precision also improves from the ANF to SBC on a single-unit level (Dehmel et al., 2010; Kuenzel et al., 2011; Keine and R\u00fcbsamen, 2015). Recent studies analyzing the EPSP size showed, that large EPSPs are better timed than small EPSPs (Kuenzel et al., 2011). Modeling studies showed that an increase in temporal precision can be achieved by a sufficiently large number of converging inputs (Rothman et al., 1993; Kuenzel et al., 2015) and such non-endbulb inputs have been reported in the rat VCN (G\u00f3mez-Nieto and Rubio, 2009). A recent modeling study showed that inhibition in combination with excitatory inputs at the dendrites could increase the temporal precision, but inhibition alone cannot (Kuenzel et al., 2015). Additionally, as documented by Nerlich et al. 2014 (and already mentioned above) the inhibitory inputs are rather slow, thus not suited to act on a spike-to-spike basis."

First, we simulated a pure divisive effect of inhibition, i.e. a random loss in output spikes. For that we used the input spike times of our recordings and pseudorandomly removed spike times to match the failure fractions observed in our recordings. The simulated SBC output then reflects a pure (divisive) scaling of the ANF input with failure rates identical to the experimental data. This simulation showed that a random reduction in postsynaptic firing rates is not sufficient to cause the observed increase in temporal precision and trial-to-trial reproducibility neither for SAM nor SFM stimulation (see <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s2\">2</a>). Next, we simulated a purely subtractive effect of inhibition by removing a fixed number of output spikes per bin, again matched to the experimentally observed failure rates. This results in an overall shift of the histogram, without affecting the gain of the response. We observed an increase in vector strength, modulation depth, reproducibility and sparsity for both the SAM and SFM stimulation. Notably, the simulated increase during SAM stimulation even exceeded the experimental data, while during SFM stimulation, the simulated subtractive inhibitory effect matched the data well."

A subtractive effect on the firing rates has been associated with hyperpolarizing inhibition with slow temporal dynamics (Doiron et al., 2001), consistent with previous slice recordings in SBCs (Nerlich et al., 2014). However, we also observed a reduced response gain of the SBC output, which is generally attributed to shunting inhibition (Rose, 1977; Koch and Poggio, 1992). Previous studies showed that both types of inhibition might be present at the SBC synapse and our data suggest that these two mechanisms result in a two-fold effect of increased temporal precision and reduced sound level dependence. While during SFM stimulation with constant stimulus level, the simulated subtractive inhibition matches the observed data well, during SAM stimulation, the simulated subtractive inhibition overestimates the effect on the SBC output. This might be caused by the inherent changes in stimulus level and the additional effect of inhibition on response gain in the experimental data."

It seems conceivable that the slow inhibitory currents will summate during acoustic stimulation, resulting in a functionally tonic inhibitory conductance (Nerlich et al., 2014; Kuenzel et al., 2015). However, it has been shown, that well-timed EPSPs are more likely to generate an SBC output than poorly timed EPSPs. Also, experimental data provided evidence that indeed the EPSP size, and \u2013 depending on this \u2013 the probability of SBC AP generation, does partially depend on the timing of the event (Keine and R\u00fcbsamen, 2015; Kuenzel et al., 2015), and it has been suggested that non-endbulb excitatory SBC inputs might facilitate AP generation of well-timed endbulb EPSPs (Ryugo and Sento, 1991; G\u00f3mez-Nieto and Rubio, 2009). The degree of non-endbulb excitatory inputs converging on SBCs and their activation pattern during acoustic stimulation remains to be investigated to draw conclusions of their importance of signal processing."

The removal of events was matched to the experimentally observed failure fractions. It appears the subtractive part of the inhibition can achieve these improvements, whereas the divisive part leaves them unchanged. On the other hand, the divisive part, together with the co-tuning of excitation and inhibition may preserve the SBC\u2019s ability to respond in a limited range of firing rates (Figure 3Biii/D). It should be noted that the simulated subtractive inhibition resulted in greater improvements than observed in the experimental data, additionally supporting a combined subtractive/divisive inhibitory action.

Subtractive and divisive inhibition have been shown to differently affect the neuron\u2019s output and tuning properties.
