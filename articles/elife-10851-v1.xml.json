Cohesin complexes containing meiosis-specific kleisin subunits govern most aspects of meiotic chromosome function, but whether Wapl regulates these complexes remains unknown. We show that during <i>C. elegans</i> oogenesis WAPL-1 antagonizes binding of cohesin containing COH-3/4 kleisins, but not REC-8, demonstrating that sensitivity to WAPL-1 is dictated by kleisin identity. By restricting the amount of chromosome-associated COH-3/4 cohesin, WAPL-1 controls chromosome structure throughout meiotic prophase. In the absence of REC-8, WAPL-1 inhibits COH-3/4-mediated cohesion, which requires crossover-fated events formed during meiotic recombination. Thus, WAPL-1 promotes functional specialization of meiotic cohesin: WAPL-1-sensitive COH-3/4 complexes modulate higher-order chromosome structure, while WAPL-1-refractory REC-8 complexes provide stable cohesion. Surprisingly, a WAPL-1-independent mechanism removes cohesin before metaphase I. Our studies provide insight into how meiosis-specific cohesin complexes are regulated to ensure formation of euploid gametes."

Cohesin complexes containing meiosis-specific kleisin subunits govern most aspects of meiotic chromosome function, but whether Wapl regulates these complexes remains unknown. We show that during <i>C. elegans</i> oogenesis WAPL-1 antagonizes binding of cohesin containing COH-3/4 kleisins, but not REC-8, demonstrating that sensitivity to WAPL-1 is dictated by kleisin identity. By restricting the amount of chromosome-associated COH-3/4 cohesin, WAPL-1 controls chromosome structure throughout meiotic prophase. In the absence of REC-8, WAPL-1 inhibits COH-3/4-mediated cohesion, which requires crossover-fated events formed during meiotic recombination. Thus, WAPL-1 promotes functional specialization of meiotic cohesin: WAPL-1-sensitive COH-3/4 complexes modulate higher-order chromosome structure, while WAPL-1-refractory REC-8 complexes provide stable cohesion. Surprisingly, a WAPL-1-independent mechanism removes cohesin before metaphase I. Our studies provide insight into how meiosis-specific cohesin complexes are regulated to ensure formation of euploid gametes."

The cohesin complex, which mediates sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) between S-phase and chromosome segregation at anaphase (<a href=\"#bib48\">Michaelis et al., 1997</a>), consists of two SMC proteins (Smc1 and Smc3) plus a kleisin subunit (Scc1/Rad21), forming a tripartite structure that topologically embraces DNA molecules (<a href=\"#bib19\">Haering et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Haering et al., 2008</a>). A fourth cohesin subunit (Scc3) binds to the kleisin and is also required for the functionality of the complex, while other proteins associate temporarily with cohesin to regulate its binding to DNA (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haarhuis et al., 2014</a>). Cohesin is loaded to chromosomes by the Scc2/4 complex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ciosk et al., 2000</a>), and SCC is established during DNA replication in a process that involves acetylation of Smc3 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Unal et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). SCC is ultimately dissolved at anaphase onset, when cleavage of the kleisin subunit by the protease separase triggers the segregation of sister chromatids to opposite poles of the spindle (<a href=\"#bib67\">Uhlmann et al., 1999</a>). Proper establishment and release of SCC is also essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis, the specialized cell division program that produces haploid gametes from diploid germ cells (<a href=\"#bib55\">Petronczki et al., 2003</a>)."

Wapl is thought to destabilize the interaction between the kleisin and Smc3 subunits, allowing the release of cohesin from DNA without catalytically cleaving any subunit (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Eichinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Huis in 't Veld et al., 2014</a>). Cohesin complexes in which the Smc3 subunit is acetylated during DNA replication become resistant to Wapl and remain stably bound to DNA, thereby providing persistent SCC (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nishiyama et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lopez-Serra et al., 2013</a>). However, acetylated cohesin is also removed from chromosome arms during prophase and early prometaphase in mammalian cells, when phosphorylation of Scc3 and Sororin, a protein that antagonizes Wapl, renders these complexes sensitive to Wapl (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hauf et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nishiyama et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Nishiyama et al., 2013</a>). This mode of cohesin removal is known as the prophase pathway and its failure in cells lacking Wapl causes increased arm cohesion in metaphase chromosomes and defects in chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#bib69\">Waizenegger et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Haarhuis et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Tedeschi et al., 2013</a>). Removal of Wapl before S-phase causes a large increase in chromatin-associated cohesin and dramatic changes in chromosome organization (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tedeschi et al., 2013</a>), demonstrating that Wapl is a key regulator of SCC and chromatin organization throughout the mitotic cell cycle."

Meiotic chromosomes are organized as linear arrays of chromatin loops, which are attached at their base to cohesin-containing proteinaceous axial elements (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kleckner, 2006</a>). Proper assembly of axial elements during early prophase is required for subsequent pairing and recombination between homologous chromosomes. Crossovers formed during recombination, together with SCC, form attachments between homologous chromosomes (chiasmata) that are responsible for the correct orientation of chromosomes on the first meiotic spindle and ultimately for their correct partitioning during the meiotic divisions (<a href=\"#bib55\">Petronczki et al., 2003</a>). Crucially, these events require the formation of axial elements containing meiosis-specific cohesin complexes in which the mitotic kleisin Scc1 is substituted by Rec8 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Klein et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Watanabe and Nurse, 1999</a>). Moreover, additional meiosis-specific kleisins beyond Rec8 have been identified in mouse (Rad21L) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Herr\u00e1n et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ishiguro et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lee and Hirano, 2011</a>) and in <i>C. elegans</i>, where the highly homologous and functionally redundant COH-3 and COH-4 kleisins associate with SMC-1 and SMC-3 to form cohesin complexes that associate with meiotic chromosomes independently of REC-8 cohesin (<a href=\"#bib60\">Severson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>). Although Rad21L and COH-3/4 are not essential for SCC, these kleisins are required for pairing and recombination between homologous chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ishiguro et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>). Interestingly, large amounts of Rad21L and COH-3/4 are removed from chromosomes before metaphase I (<a href=\"#bib24\">Herr\u00e1n et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ishiguro et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lee and Hirano, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>), and a prophase pathway has recently been proposed to operate during late meiotic prophase in plants (<a href=\"#bib9\">De et al., 2014</a>). However, whether Wapl induces cohesin removal at any stage of meiotic prophase in animals, and whether Wapl may regulate some of the functions of different meiosis-specific cohesin complexes is not known."

By antagonizing the binding of COH-3/4 complexes to axial elements, WAPL-1 acts as a regulator of meiotic chromosome structure and SCC. Moreover, we also show that SCC is modulated by WAPL-1 and recombination during the chromosome remodeling process that starts at the end of pachytene, and report that a WAPL-1-independent mechanism removes cohesin during the oocyte maturation process preceding metaphase I."

In fact, observation of diakinesis oocytes (the last stage of meiotic prophase) showed that both wild type and <i>wapl-1</i> mutant oocytes displayed 6 DAPI-stained bodies, demonstrating that WAPL-1 is not required for chiasma formation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Nonetheless, the reduced fertility of <i>wapl-1</i> mutants suggested that WAPL-1 may play important roles in the germ line. Thus, we investigated the staining pattern of WAPL-1 during meiosis by creating transgenic worms homozygous for the <i>tm1814</i> deletion and for a single-copy insertion of a transgene that expresses a GFP::WAPL-1 fusion protein using the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 UTRs from the <i>wapl-1</i> locus. Expression of this transgene largely rescued the fertility defects of <i>wapl-1(tm1814)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), and western blot analysis confirmed the presence of a band of the expected molecular weight for the GFP::WAPL-1 fusion protein, although the overall intensity of this band was reduced compared to the endogenous WAPL-1 protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Staining of germ lines from these transgenic worms with anti-GFP antibodies demonstrated that the GFP::WAPL-1 protein is present, with a diffuse staining pattern, in both mitotic and meiotic nuclei (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Interestingly, the intensity of the GFP::WAPL-1 signal decreased drastically as transition zone nuclei acquired the chromosome clustering characteristic of early meiotic prophase stages (leptotene and zygotene), peaking again at late pachytene and then remaining at similar high levels in diplotene and diakinesis oocytes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

During oogenesis, each meiotic division results in the formation of a polar body that contains a full complement of homologs (meiosis I) or sister chromatids (meiosis II). Polar bodies are extruded away from the egg pronucleus, localizing on the cortex and not contributing to the genetic content of the developing embryo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). All <i>wapl-1</i> mutant embryos analyzed formed two polar bodies, however, only 22% of post meiotic embryos (up to the two-cell embryo) displayed both polar bodies at the cortex, with most embryos (61%) displaying one polar body located away from the cortex and the remaining (11%) displaying both polar bodies away from the cortex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>). In addition, we noticed that chromatin morphology in the polar bodies was altered in <i>wapl-1</i> mutants, often displaying separated DNA masses within the polar body (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To gain better understanding of the effect of WAPL-1 on polar body extrusion, we performed live imaging of the meiotic and early mitotic divisions in wild type and <i>wapl-1</i> mutant embryos expressing histone H2B::mcherry (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D;</a> <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media3\">3</a>). These experiments confirmed that most <i>wapl-1</i> mutant embryos display defects in the extrusion of the second polar body (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media3\">3</a>). We also observed that in 2 out of 11 <i>wapl-1</i> mutant embryos, the second polar body, which failed to migrate to the cortex, underwent chromatin decondesation and condensation cycles, mimicking the changes observed in the mitotic nuclei of the embryo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media3\">3</a>). Moreover, in 1 out of 11 filmed embryos the second polar body eventually fused with one of the mitotic nuclei generated after the first mitotic division (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), demonstrating that the failure in polar body extrusion of <i>wapl-1</i> mutants can lead to aneuploidy in the embryo. We also used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to investigate if chromosome non-disjunction occurs during the meiotic divisions of <i>wapl-1</i> mutants. Labeling of the 5S rDNA locus on chromosome V in early embryos demonstrated that the oocyte pronucleus contained one single signal for the 5S rDNA in all embryos analyzed from wild-type (17) and <i>wapl-1</i> mutants (17) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), suggesting that chromosome V segregates properly during the meiotic divisions in the absence of WAPL-1. This analysis demonstrates that WAPL-1 is required to ensure proper polar body extrusion during the meiotic divisions, and suggests that defects in this process may contribute to the embryonic lethality observed in <i>wapl-1</i> mutants."

Polar bodies are found near the cortex in WT control, but one (middle panel) or both (right-hand side panel) polar bodies localize away from the cortex in <i>wapl-1</i> mutant embryos. (<b>B</b>) Quantification of the percentage of embryos with zero, one, or two polar bodies localized at the cortex (36 embryos scored in <i>wapl-1</i> and 34 in WT). (<b>C</b>) Quantification of polar body behavior in videos from live WT and <i>wapl-1</i> mutant embryos expressing a histone H2B::mcherry fusion protein. Note that 7 out of 11 <i>wapl-1</i> mutant embryos displayed defects in polar body extrusion. Examples of videos used for the quantification are shown in <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> (WT), <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media3\">3</a> (<i>wapl-1</i>).

Abbreviations: PB I (first polar body), PB II (second polar body), OP (oocyte pronucleus), SP (sperm pronocleus), P0 (first mitotic metaphase following fusion of OP and SP), P1 and AB (cells resulting from the first mitotic division). Note that in the WT embryo PB II remains highly condensed and locates close to PB I on the cortex. In the <i>wapl-1</i> mutant embryo, PB II becomes decondensed and fails to move to the cortex, first remaining close to the OP and then close to the AB cell produced after the first mitotic division. Chromosomes from AB and PB II appear to mix together before the second mitotic division of the embryo. (<b>E</b>) Projections of fixed embryos following the completion of the second meiotic division and labeled with a FISH probe against the 5S rDNA locus on chromosome V and DAPI. Note that in both WT and <i>wapl-1</i> mutant embryos the oocyte pronucleus (OP) and the second polar body (PB II) contain a single FISH signal, even when PB II is not localized on the cortex and chromatin appears decondensed (<i>wapl-1</i> example on right-hand side)."

Meiotic chromosomes are organized around axial elements containing cohesin and meiosis-specific HORMA-domain proteins (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kleckner, 2006</a>). Thus, we used antibodies against HTP-3, a HORMA-domain protein that is an essential component of axial elements in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Goodyer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Severson et al., 2009</a>), to investigate chromosome organization in <i>wapl-1</i> mutants. Projections made from late pachytene nuclei of wild-type germ lines demonstrated ample overlap between different HTP-3-labeled axial elements, making it difficult to follow individual HTP-3 tracks along their whole length (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, the overlap of HTP-3 tracks was reduced in <i>wapl-1</i> mutants, with some nuclei displaying six distinctive HTP-3 tracks (one per homolog pair) that could be clearly traced along their full length (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Measuring of total HTP-3 track length per nucleus demonstrated a 28% decrease in axial element length in late pachytene nuclei of <i>wapl-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

(<b>D</b>) Projections of mid pachytene nuclei stained with anti-HTP-3 antibodies (axial elements), DAPI, and labeled with a probe against the 5S rDNA locus on chromosome V. Most nuclei in <i>syp-1</i> and <i>wapl-1 syp-1</i> mutants display 2 5S foci, showing that homologs are not associated (quantification shown in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). (<b>E</b>) Projection of a late pachytene nucleus stained with DAPI, anti-HTP-3 antibodies and anti-HIM-8 antibodies (binding to a single end of the X chromosome). Both HIM-8 signals are located at the end of a short HTP-3 track, each one representing a highly compacted X chromosome. Shortening of X chromosome axial elements in late pachytene nuclei was seen in 3 out of 3 <i>syp-1 wapl-1</i> germ lines.

Appearance of PLK-2 aggregates on the nuclear envelope marks the onset of meiotic prophase (leptotene stage). In the WT germ line, SMC-1::GFP tracks are only observed in nuclei with PLK-2 aggregates, while pre-leptotene nuclei display diffuse SMC-1::GFP staining (arrows). SMC-1::GFP tracks are present in pre-leptotene nuclei of <i>wapl-1</i> mutants (arrows).

In order to understand better the effect of WAPL-1 on the organization of axial elements, we investigated chromosome structure in pachytene nuclei of <i>wapl-1 syp-1</i> double mutants, since lack of SYP-1 prevents SC assembly without affecting the formation of axial elements (<a href=\"#bib43\">MacQueen et al., 2002</a>). Late pachytene nuclei of <i>syp-1</i> mutant germ lines displayed many long and thin HTP-3 tracks, corresponding to individualized and elongated axial elements (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In contrast, late pachytene nuclei of <i>wapl-1 syp-1</i> double mutants contained fewer HTP-3 tracks, which also appeared bulkier (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This suggested that axial elements were much shorter, and/or the presence of some kind of SC-independent association between axial elements, in <i>wapl-1 syp-1</i> double mutants. Visualization of the 5S rDNA locus on chromosome V by FISH showed that this region was unpaired in most pachytene nuclei of both <i>syp-1</i> and <i>wapl-1 syp-1</i> double mutants, demonstrating that increased association of homologous axial elements is not responsible for the overall reduction in total axial element length observed in <i>wapl-1 syp-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Moreover, visualization of the X chromosome pairing center region using HIM-8 antibodies (<a href=\"#bib56\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>) demonstrated that at late pachytene, when this region becomes separated in <i>syp-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib43\">MacQueen et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), each HIM-8 signal is associated with a short track of axial element in <i>syp-1 wapl-1</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, removal of WAPL-1 induces dramatic changes in the overall organization of axial elements in pachytene nuclei."

In order to visualize all cohesin complexes in the germ line we used CRISPR to add a C-terminal GFP tag on the endogenous <i>smc-1</i> gene. Homozygous <i>smc-1::GFP</i> worms are viable and healthy and, as expected, the SMC-1::GFP protein is present in all germline and somatic nuclei. To clearly define the onset of meiotic prophase (leptotene stage), we stained germ lines of SMC-1::GFP wild type and <i>wapl-1</i> mutant worms with PLK-2 antibodies, as PLK-2 forms aggregates on the nuclear envelope of leptotene nuclei to promote homolog pairing (<a href=\"#bib35\">Labella et al., 2011</a>). In wild-type germ lines, the presence of elongated SMC-1::GFP structures (axial elements) coincided with the appearance of PLK-2 aggregates (8 out 8 germ\u00a0lines), while nuclei preceding the formation of PLK-2 aggregates displayed diffuse SMC-1::GFP staining (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). In contrast, the appearance of elongated SMC-1::GFP structures preceded the formation of PLK-2 aggregates in transition zone nuclei of <i>wapl-1</i> mutant germ lines (7 out of 8 germ lines, average of 5 nuclei per germ line) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Interestingly, transition zone nuclei in which chromosome clustering has not yet occurred display the highest intensity of WAPL-1 staining in the whole germ line (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that high levels of WAPL-1 activity may be present in these nuclei. These observations suggest that WAPL-1 regulates the timing of axial element assembly by antagonizing cohesin association with chromosomes during early meiosis."

                                "text": "During late pachytene meiotic chromosomes initiate a major remodeling process that includes the ordered disassembly of the SC, chromosome condensation and changes in axial element composition (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nabeshima et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">de Carvalho et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Martinez-Perez et al., 2008</a>). Whether the early steps of this process involve major changes in the association of cohesin with chromosomes is not known, but imaging of SMC-1::GFP in wild-type germ lines demonstrated that a diffuse pool of nuclear SMC-1::GFP starts accumulating in late pachytene, becoming very prominent in diplotene and diakinesis oocytes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). This staining pattern suggests that there is strong expression of <i>smc-1</i> during late prophase, but that most of this SMC-1 remains unbound to chromosomes, and/or that cohesin is actively removed from axial elements during these stages. In contrast, a diffuse pool of SMC-1::GFP is not observed in late prophase nuclei of <i>wapl-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Moreover, while axial elements labeled by SMC-1::GFP remained as easily traceable linear structures in diplotene nuclei of <i>wapl-1</i> mutants, they appeared as longer and more diffuse structures in wild-type oocytes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). This suggests that WAPL-1 antagonizes cohesin binding during late pachytene and diplotene stages. Interestingly, the intensity of nuclear GFP::WAPL-1 undergoes an increase during late pachytene and diplotene compared with earlier prophase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that WAPL-1 activity may be increased during these stages."

During <i>C. elegans</i> meiosis cohesin complexes carrying different kleisin subunits, either REC-8 or the highly homologous and functionally redundant COH-3 and COH-4, associate with axial elements to ensure efficient SCC and crossover formation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Pasierbek et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Severson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>). Thus, we used anti-REC-8 and anti-COH-3/4 antibodies (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) to determine the staining pattern of the different meiotic cohesin complexes in the presence and absence of WAPL-1. Upon initial observation, the intensity of REC-8 staining appeared very similar in <i>wapl-1</i> mutant germ lines and wild-type controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). However, the COH-3/4 signal was clearly increased in <i>wapl-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). A quantitative analysis of the mean nuclear intensity of REC-8 and COH-3/4 staining between leptotene and late pachytene confirmed that <i>wapl-1</i> mutant germ lines display increased levels of COH-3/4 throughout meiotic prophase, with the highest differences detected in late pachytene nuclei (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The same results were obtained using a COH-3-specific antibody, instead of the COH-3/4 used above, and anti-GFP antibodies to determine the staining of REC-8::GFP expressed from a single copy, and fully functional, transgene (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig5s4\">4</a>). In order to confirm that removal of WAPL-1 causes an increase in the levels of axis-associated COH-3/4, we also performed a line profile analysis of REC-8, COH-3/4 and SMC-3 intensity across late pachytene nuclei. This analysis allows a direct comparison of the signal intensity associated with axial elements versus the intensity observed in the inter-chromosomal regions of the same nucleus. The average difference between axis-associated and inter-chromosomal signal for COH-3/4 was increased by 114% in <i>wapl-1</i> mutants compared with wild-type controls, while the increase observed for REC-8 and SMC-3 was 27% and 59% respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The intermediate increase of axis-associated SMC-3 levels is to be expected since SMC-3 should form part of both REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesin complexes. Separation of soluble and DNA-bound protein fractions from whole-worm extracts confirmed that the amount of COH-4 associated with DNA is increased in <i>wapl-1</i> mutants compared to wild-type controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Therefore, in the absence of WAPL-1 there is a large increase in the amount of cohesin associated with axial elements, and most of this increase corresponds to cohesin complexes containing the COH-3/4 kleisins."

                                "text": "Following exit from pachytene, meiotic chromosomes undergo a condensation process that culminates with the formation of highly compacted and individualized chromatin structures seen in diakinesis oocytes, where 6 bivalents (pairs of homologous chromosomes linked together by chiasmata) are present in wild-type oocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The presence of between 7 and 12 chromatin masses in diakinesis oocytes indicates defects in the formation of chiasmata, while defects in SCC typically result in oocytes containing more than 12 chromatin bodies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Although gross loss of SCC in diakinesis oocytes requires the simultaneous depletion of REC-8, COH-3 and COH-4 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Severson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tzur et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>), REC-8 appears to play a more prominent role in mediating SCC than COH-3/4. For example, removal of REC-8 from <i>spo-11</i> mutants, which fail to form meiotic DSBs, induces extensive separation of sister chromatids in oocytes, and removal of REC-8 from mutants lacking the SC results in oocytes with separated sisters and extensive chromosome fragmentation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Colai\u00e1covo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Severson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>). In contrast, removing SPO-11 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>) or the SC from <i>coh-3 coh-4</i> double mutants does not compromise SCC in diakinesis oocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). These observations, together with the finding that WAPL-1 antagonizes the association of COH-3/4 with axial elements, led us to\u00a0investigate if the antagonistic effect of WAPL-1 on COH-3/4 may be responsible for the compromised cohesion in mutants lacking REC-8. We first tested if removing WAPL-1 from <i>spo-11 rec-8</i> double mutants had an effect on SCC observed in oocytes. Strikingly, the presence of detached sister chromatids was dramatically reduced in the oocytes of <i>wapl-1 spo-11 rec-8</i> triple mutants, which displayed an average of 11.2 DAPI-stained bodies, while diakinesis oocytes of <i>spo-11 rec-8</i> double mutants displayed an average of 19.1 DAPI-stained bodies, demonstrating that WAPL-1 antagonizes cohesion in <i>spo-11 rec-8</i> oocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>). Crucially, cohesion observed in <i>wapl-1 spo-11 rec-8</i> oocytes is mediated by COH-3/4, since sister chromatids were separated in oocytes of <i>wapl-1 spo-11 rec-8 coh-3 coh-4</i> quintuple mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>). Given that DSBs are required for tethering sister chromatids in <i>rec-8</i> oocytes (<a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>), we tested if the cohesion rescue observed in <i>wapl-1 spo-11 rec-8</i> oocytes could be due to the presence of unscheduled DSBs in these triple mutants. However, RAD-51 foci were not observed in germ lines of <i>wapl-1 spo-11 rec-8</i> triple mutants (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that removal of WAPL-1 increases COH-3/4-mediated cohesion independently of DSBs. Introducing the <i>GFP::wapl-1</i> transgene into <i>wapl-1 spo-11 rec-8</i> triple mutants resulted in oocytes with separated sister chromatids (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>), confirming that WAPL-1 antagonizes COH-3/4-mediated cohesion."

The extensive presence of small chromosome fragments with irregular shapes in <i>rec-8 syp-1</i> oocytes made manual quantification of the number of DAPI-stained bodies impractical. Thus, we used CellProfiler to determine the boundaries and area (in pixels) of each DAPI-stained body in projections of diakinesis oocytes. By imaging diakinesis oocytes from wild type, <i>coh-3 coh-4</i> double mutants and <i>rec-8 spo-11</i> double mutants we were able to calibrate the area range corresponding to bivalents, univalents and sister chromatids respectively. Despite the fact that some overlap of chromosomes occurs in projections of diakinesis oocytes, this automated method clearly identifies the predominant types of chromatin bodies known to be present in each of the three genotypes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Based on this analysis, chromosome fragments were defined by an area smaller than 120 pixels and 49% of chromatin bodies in <i>syp-1 rec-8</i> oocytes fell within this category (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). In contrast, chromosome fragments only accounted for 10% of chromatin bodies in <i>wapl-1 rec-8 syp-1</i> oocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013F</a>). This reduction in chromosome fragments was accompanied by a large increase in the number of chromatin bodies corresponding to univalents. Thus, WAPL-1 is largely responsible for the chromosome fragmentation and sister separation seen in <i>rec-8 syp-1</i> oocytes, likely by antagonizing COH-3/4 cohesin. We further tested this possibility by building a <i>coh-4 rec-8</i> double mutant, in which we hypothesized that the presence of a single meiotic kleisin (COH-3) should result in a worsening of the cohesion defects observed in <i>rec-8</i> single mutants. In agreement with this, 25% of chromatin bodies in <i>coh-4 rec-8</i> oocytes had an area corresponding to chromosome fragments, while this number was reduced to 8% in <i>wapl-1 coh-4 rec-8</i> oocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013H</a>). These observations demonstrate that WAPL-1 antagonizes SCC mediated by COH-3/4 both in the presence and absence of SPO-11 DSBs."

                                "text": "Sister chromatids remain attached in the diakinesis oocytes of <i>rec-8</i> mutants, but the contact between them is often limited to a very small region, giving <i>rec-8</i> univalents a bilobed appearance that contrasts with the rounded appearance of univalents observed in recombination-deficient mutants such as <i>spo-11</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)(<a href=\"#bib60\">Severson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Collette et al., 2011</a>). Why sisters are weakly attached in <i>rec-8</i> oocytes remains unknown, but these attachments require SPO-11 DSBs (<a href=\"#bib60\">Severson et al., 2009</a>), leading to the proposal that DSBs induce phosphorylation of COH-3/4, which in turn make these complexes cohesive in a pathway similar to the damage-induced cohesion observed in mitotic yeast cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>). However, we considered the possibility that the formation of inter-sister recombination events during the repair of SPO-11 DSBs leads to the formation of sister attachments in <i>rec-8</i> oocytes. To test this hypothesis we built worms lacking REC-8 and COSA-1, a protein required for the late stages of crossover formation but not for the induction of DSBs (<a href=\"#bib74\">Yokoo et al., 2012</a>). Strikingly, oocytes from <i>rec-8 cosa-1</i> double mutants display a dramatic increase in the number of DAPI-stained bodies (average 23.89) compared with <i>rec-8</i> (average 13.06) and <i>cosa-1</i> (average 11.83) single mutants, suggesting extensive separation of sister chromatids (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013B</a>). FISH experiments confirmed extensive separation of sister chromatids in diakinesis oocytes of <i>rec-8 cosa-1</i> double mutants, while also demonstrating that SCC is not affected in pachytene nuclei of these same mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013D</a>). Thus, loss of cohesion must occur during the chromosome remodeling process that starts at late pachytene. These results suggest that attachments between sister chromatids in diakinesis oocytes of <i>rec-8</i> mutants require the presence of a recombination event formed by the COSA-1-dependent crossover pathway. Moreover, similar to the situation in <i>spo-11 rec-8</i> oocytes, removing WAPL-1 from <i>rec-8 cosa-1</i> mutants restored cohesion in diakinesis oocytes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013B</a>), confirming that WAPL-1 antagonizes cohesion mediated by COH-3/4 during late prophase."

In most cases (21 out of 26 analyzed germ lines) this reduction is evident between the -2 and -1 oocytes, while in a few germ lines the reduction was more evident between the -3 and -2 oocytes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Thus, WAPL-1 affects meiotic prophase events by promoting cohesin removal from the beginning of meiosis, not just as part of a meiotic prophase pathway that removes cohesin during the late stages of chromosome condensation in preparation for the first meiotic division. Importantly, we have uncovered that cohesin complexes containing the COH-3/4 kleisins, rather than REC-8, are the main targets of WAPL-1, showing that kleisin identity is key in determining the sensitivity of meiotic cohesin to WAPL-1 activity."

Under this organization, the shape of chromosomes is largely determined by the size of chromatin loops and by the compaction exerted by axial elements on loop bases, two parameters that must be regulated by proteins localizing to axial elements. In fact, the meiosis-specific subunit Smc1\u03b2, which localizes to axial elements, regulates the organization of chromatin loops and the length of axial elements in mouse pachytene oocytes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Novak et al., 2008</a>). This suggests that a key role of meiosis-specific cohesin complexes may be to modulate the higher-order organization of chromosomes. Our studies provide strong support for this hypothesis. First, the formation of SMC-1-labelled axial elements is observed in nuclei before the onset of meiotic prophase (leptotene) in <i>wapl-1</i> mutants, but not in wild-type germ lines. Interestingly, the intensity of GFP::WAPL-1 is at its highest in nuclei preceding leptotene, suggesting that WAPL-1 antagonizes cohesin binding from the onset of meiosis and that the regulation of WAPL-1 levels, and presumably its activity, may be coupled to meiotic progression. Second, in pachytene nuclei removal of WAPL-1 causes a dramatic increase in the levels of chromosome-associated COH-3/4 cohesin and shortening of axial elements, consistent with COH-3/4 complexes acting as regulators of axis compaction. Shortening of axial elements is also observed in yeast cells lacking <i>wpl1</i> (A. Shinohara personal communication), consistent with our findings. Interestingly, we observed that the shortening of axial elements caused by the absence of WAPL-1 is exacerbated in mutants lacking the SC, hinting that the SC is somehow capable of antagonizing cohesin\u2019s ability to induce compaction of axial elements."

The specific effect of WAPL-1 on COH-3/4 complexes is consistent with the finding that REC-8 and COH-3/4 display clear differences in their timing and mechanism of loading during early prophase (<a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>), and may help to explain some of the functional differences between REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesin. For example, the fact that REC-8 complexes are refractory to the removal activity of WAPL-1 is consistent with these complexes playing a prominent role in providing cohesion, while COH-3/4 promote SC assembly in a cohesion-independent fashion (<a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>). Similarly, mouse Rad21L promotes homolog pairing without playing a direct role in cohesion, presumably by regulating higher-order structure of chromosomes during early prophase (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ishiguro et al., 2014</a>). A clear precedent for cohesin affecting chromosome topology independently of cohesion is observed when Wapl is removed from mammalian cells before S-phase, which causes unscheduled condensation of unreplicated chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tedeschi et al., 2013</a>). We propose that by antagonizing the stable association of COH-3/4 cohesin to axial elements, WAPL-1 acts as a major regulator of meiotic chromosome structure."

In mitotic cells, Wapl is thought to mediate cohesin removal by triggering opening of an 'exit gate' present at the interface delimited by the interaction between the N-terminal region of Smc3 and the Scc1 kleisin (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gligoris et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Huis in 't Veld et al., 2014</a>). Opening of this interface by Wapl is antagonized by acetylation of two conserved lysines in Smc3, a process that is mediated by the acetyl transferase Eco1 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Unal et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Under unchallenged growth conditions, Smc3 acetylation only occurs during DNA replication, since Eco1 is degraded after S-phase (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lyons and Morgan, 2011</a>). Thus, cohesin that associates with chromosomes during G2 is not acetylated and shows a rapid turnover mediated by Wapl (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kueng et al., 2006</a>). Interestingly, REC-8 is the only meiosis-specific kleisin subunit that appears to be loaded to chromosomes during S-phase in mice and worms, while Rad21L (mice) and COH-3/4 (worms) are loaded post S-phase (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ishiguro et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>). Thus, a plausible explanation for our observations is that only REC-8 forms part of cohesin complexes in which SMC-3 is acetylated, while COH-3/4 associate with non-acetylated SMC-3 and therefore are sensitive to WAPL-1. However, mechanisms that protect cohesin from the removal activity of Wapl independently of Smc3 acetylation have been described in yeast and human mitotic cells. For example, DSBs induce the establishment of Wpl1-resistant cohesion during G2 by a mechanism involving Eco1-mediated acetylation of Scc1 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, depletion of Eco1 after meiotic S-phase induces chromosome segregation defects in <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes, suggesting that Eco1 is functional during meiotic prophase, although the targets of Eco1 in this case remain unknown (<a href=\"#bib71\">Weng et al., 2014</a>). In addition to acetylation by Eco1, the presence of DNA damage also induces Scc1 sumoylation, which is required for establishment of cohesion and sister chromatid-mediated homologous repair during G2 (<a href=\"#bib46\">McAleenan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wu et al., 2012</a>). If posttranslational modifications on REC-8, or another subunit of REC-8 complexes, are required to antagonize the releasing activity of WAPL-1, untimely loss of these modifications could lead to premature release of REC-8 cohesin, compromising chromosome segregation during the meiotic divisions. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that prevent removal of REC-8 complexes by WAPL-1 during meiotic prophase remains an important goal for future studies."

In organisms as diverse as <i>Sordaria</i> and mouse (oocytes), visualization of cohesin during late prophase demonstrates that the emergence of compacted chromosomes attached by chiasmata is preceded by the large disappearance of axial elements as continuous linear structures, and by the accumulation of diffuse cohesin staining in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib57\">Prieto et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Storlazzi et al., 2008</a>). We report that WAPL-1 promotes loosening of axial element structure and accumulation of soluble cohesin during late prophase in <i>C. elegans</i>, suggesting that a Wapl-dependent weakening of cohesin-mediated chromosome organization may be a general feature of late prophase chromosome remodeling. Importantly, this wave of WAPL-1-mediated cohesin removal has a direct impact on the ability of COH-3/4 complexes to provide cohesion following the completion of chromosome remodeling. In the absence of REC-8, attachment of sister chromatids in diakinesis oocytes requires COH-3/4 cohesin and SPO-11 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Severson et al., 2009</a>), but since sister chromatids are attached in pachytene nuclei of <i>spo-11 rec-8</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>), loss of cohesion must occur during the process of chromosome remodeling via an unknown mechanism. By showing that removal of WAPL-1 causes a rescue of cohesion in oocytes of <i>spo-11 rec-8</i> double mutants and that this rescue requires COH-3/4 cohesin, we clearly identify WAPL-1 as a factor that antagonizes COH-3/4-mediated cohesion during late prophase."

The requirement of DSBs for cohesion in diakinesis oocytes of <i>rec-8</i> mutants has been explained by the existence of a mechanism similar to the break-induced cohesion observed in mitotic yeast cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>). Under this model, DSBs trigger establishment of COH-3/4 cohesion via a mechanism involving CHK-2-mediated phosphorylation of COH-3/4. However, we show that removal of COSA-1, a protein that localizes to chromosomes during late pachytene and that is not required for the formation and early processing of DSBs (<a href=\"#bib74\">Yokoo et al., 2012</a>), causes loss of cohesion in diakinesis oocytes of <i>rec-8</i> mutants. Therefore, the presence of DSBs alone is not sufficient to induce COH-3/4 cohesion that persists in diakinesis oocytes. Instead, tethering of sister chromatids in <i>rec-8</i> mutant oocytes appears to require the presence of crossover-fated recombination events. This requirement would explain the lack of cohesion in diakinesis oocytes of <i>spo-11 rec-8</i>, which fail to initiate recombination, and in oocytes of <i>syp-1 rec-8</i> double mutants, since SYP-1 is required for crossover formation (<a href=\"#bib43\">MacQueen et al., 2002</a>). Interestingly, SC proteins are thought to load between sister chromatids in mouse and worm mutants lacking REC-8 (<a href=\"#bib73\">Xu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rog and Dernburg, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>), suggesting that SC-promoted recombination intermediates may form between sister chromatids in <i>rec-8</i> mutants. In agreement with this possibility, crossover designation appears to occur normally in <i>Sordaria rec8</i> mutants, which also display SC formation between sister chromatids (<a href=\"#bib63\">Storlazzi et al., 2008</a>). Since sister chromatids are not separated in pachytene nuclei of <i>spo-11 rec-8, syp-1 rec-8</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Severson and Meyer, 2014</a>) or <i>cosa-1 rec-8</i> (this study), and removal of WAPL-1 from these three mutants restores cohesion in diakinesis oocytes, the antagonistic effect of WAPL-1 on COH-3/4 cohesion must occur after pachytene exit. Our studies identify chromosome remodeling as a key stage in the modulation of cohesion during meiotic prophase, and suggest that a complex interplay between late crossover precursors and WAPL-1 plays an important role in this process."

                                "text": "An essential aspect of meiotic chromosome segregation is ensuring that chiasmata remain intact until the onset of anaphase I. This issue is particularly relevant to human fertility, as oocytes establish chiasmata during fetal development, but then arrest at the dictyate stage, with the first meiotic division only taking place at ovulation, up to several decades later. In fact, cohesion deterioration in arrested oocytes has been proposed as a contributing factor to explain why the incidence of aneuploidy increases dramatically with maternal age (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nagaoka et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Herbert et al., 2015</a>). Data from different mouse models offer support for this possibility. First, partial loss of cohesin before metaphase I in oocytes of mice lacking Smc1\u03b2 (a meiosis-specific Smc1 subunit) causes the dissolution of chiasmata (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hodges et al., 2005</a>). Second, Rec8-mediated cohesion is not regenerated during late stages of meiotic prophase (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tachibana-Konwalski et al., 2010</a>) and Smc1\u03b2 expressed before birth is sufficient to ensure chiasma maintenance throughout adult age (<a href=\"#bib58\">Revenkova et al., 2010</a>). Third, age-related deterioration of bivalents is observed in oocytes from <i>Smc1\u03b2</i> mutant mice (<a href=\"#bib58\">Revenkova et al., 2010</a>), as well as in oocytes from old (long lived) wild-type mice that also display defects in chromosome segregation and depletion of cohesin from chromosomes before anaphase onset (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lister et al., 2010</a>). These observations are consistent with the view that cohesin deterioration could be an important contributor to human aneuploidy. However, the mechanisms responsible for cohesin depletion in aged oocytes are not known, with possible explanations including decay of cohesin molecules over time and leaky separase activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jessberger, 2012</a>). We have found that two different mechanisms actively remove cohesin during late prophase as part of normal meiotic progression: First, WAPL-1 antagonizes cohesin during chromosome remodeling and second, a WAPL-1-independent wave of cohesin removal occurs during oocyte maturation. These findings could be relevant to human aneuploidy, as excessive cohesin removal by the WAPL-1-dependent or independent mechanisms identified here could compromise maintenance of chiasmata before the onset of anaphase I, inducing errors in chromosome segregation during the meiotic divisions."

First, we have significantly extended our in vivo analysis of meiotic chromosome segregation by filming 11 <i>wapl-1</i> mutant and 14 wild type embryos. This new data demonstrates that the second polar body fails to be extruded in most (7/11) <i>wapl-1</i> mutant embryos, confirming our previous results on fixed embryos. Crucially, the new in vivo data reveals that the second polar body undergoes cycles of chromatin condensation and decondensation, mimicking the cell cycle of the oocyte pronucleus first and then mitotic nuclei, and that eventually chromosomes in the second polar body can fuse with the content of a mitotic nucleus. This demonstrates that the defects in polar body extrusion observed in <i>wapl-1</i> mutants induce the formation of embryos carrying abnormalities in chromosome number, likely contributing to the embryonic lethality that we report. This data is presented on a new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, which includes a table summarizing the findings from all filmed embryos, as well as in 3 supplemental Movies. Second, we have used FISH to directly assess the segregation of chromosome V during the meiotic divisions. This analysis in 17 WT and 17 <i>wapl-1</i> mutant embryos shows that all analyzed oocyte pronuclei contained a single copy of chromosome V, demonstrating normal segregation of chromosome V during the meiotic divisions. Although this FISH analysis cannot rule out segregation defects of the other five chromosomes present in <i>C. elegans</i>, our in vivo data clearly demonstrates that wapl-1 mutant embryos are defective in the extrusion of the second polar body and that this defect contributes to produce chromosomally abnormal embryos."

These new experiments confirm that WAPL-1 restricts COH-4 binding to chromosomes, fully supporting our previous observations based on the analysis of cohesin distribution by immunostaining.
