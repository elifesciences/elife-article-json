                    "text": "The generation of diverse neuronal subtypes involves specification of neural progenitors and, subsequently, postmitotic neuronal differentiation, a relatively poorly understood process. Here, we describe a mechanism whereby the neurotrophic factor NGF and the transcription factor Runx1 coordinate postmitotic differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors, a major nociceptor subtype. We show that the integrity of a Runx1/CBF\u03b2 holocomplex is crucial for NGF-dependent nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. NGF signals through the ERK/MAPK pathway to promote expression of <i>Cbfb</i> but not <i>Runx1</i> prior to maturation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. In contrast, transcriptional initiation of <i>Runx1</i> in nonpeptidergic nociceptor precursors is dependent on the homeodomain transcription factor Islet1, which is largely dispensable for <i>Cbfb</i> expression. Thus, an NGF/TrkA-MAPK-CBF\u03b2 pathway converges with Islet1-Runx1 signaling to promote Runx1/CBF\u03b2 holocomplex formation and nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. Convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic signals to control heterodimeric transcription factor complex formation provides a robust mechanism for postmitotic neuronal subtype specification."

                    "text": "The generation of diverse neuronal subtypes involves specification of neural progenitors and, subsequently, postmitotic neuronal differentiation, a relatively poorly understood process. Here, we describe a mechanism whereby the neurotrophic factor NGF and the transcription factor Runx1 coordinate postmitotic differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors, a major nociceptor subtype. We show that the integrity of a Runx1/CBF\u03b2 holocomplex is crucial for NGF-dependent nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. NGF signals through the ERK/MAPK pathway to promote expression of <i>Cbfb</i> but not <i>Runx1</i> prior to maturation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. In contrast, transcriptional initiation of <i>Runx1</i> in nonpeptidergic nociceptor precursors is dependent on the homeodomain transcription factor Islet1, which is largely dispensable for <i>Cbfb</i> expression. Thus, an NGF/TrkA-MAPK-CBF\u03b2 pathway converges with Islet1-Runx1 signaling to promote Runx1/CBF\u03b2 holocomplex formation and nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. Convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic signals to control heterodimeric transcription factor complex formation provides a robust mechanism for postmitotic neuronal subtype specification."

They form two distinct subtypes: peptidergic nerves detect potentially dangerous temperatures, whereas non-peptidergic nerves detect potentially dangerous mechanical sensations. Both subtypes originate from the same precursor nerve cell and both initially depend on an external molecule called NGF for their development and survival. During their development, non-peptidergic neurons stop responding to NGF and start producing a protein called Runx1, considered to be the \u2018master regulator\u2019 of non-peptidergic nerve cell development. Runx1 works by forming a complex with another protein called CBFb\u03b2, and this complex activates a program of gene expression that is specific to non-peptidergic nerves. However it was unclear how an external signal, like NGF, can coordinate with or influence a nerve cell\u2019s internal genetic program during the nerve\u2019s development. It was also not known whether NGF and Runx1 interact with each other."

An NGF-driven signalling pathway activates the production of CBF\u03b2, while another protein binds to the Runx1 gene to switch it on. This leads to the production of the Runx1 and CBF\u03b2 proteins that complex together to activate the non-peptidergic neuronal genetic program."

A recurring theme in the early phase of neural progenitor specification of the vertebrate nervous system is that the interplay between intrinsic determinants and extrinsic signals governs neural cell fate decisions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fishell and Heintz, 2013</a>). Indeed, cell fate choice of progenitor cells is determined by a combination of intrinsic genetic programs, which define the differentiation potential or the competence state of progenitors, and extrinsic cues, which influence the relative proportions of each cell type generated within the confines of a given competent state (<a href=\"#bib25\">Livesey and Cepko, 2001</a>). Our understanding of the mechanisms of postmitotic differentiation of neuronal subtypes, on the other hand, is rather limited, and thus the relative contributions of extrinsic and intrinsic signals, and their mechanisms of interplay during late phases of cell fate determination, remain poorly understood."

The existence of a large number of functionally specialized DRG sensory neuron subtypes, each endowed with unique morphological and physiological properties enables the somatosensory system to encode diverse sensory information, including nociception, temperature, light touch, limb movement, and body position. DRG neurons can be classified into three major classes: nociceptors, which preferentially respond to noxious stimuli, pruritogenic stimuli, and temperature; mechanoreceptors, which respond to innocuous tactile sensations; and proprioceptors, which detect position and movement of the trunk and limbs. Each functional class is further subdivided into subtypes exhibiting distinct physiological, morphological, and molecular properties (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Usoskin et al., 2015</a>). Since the same Neurogenin1-dependent progenitor population gives rise to the three principal DRG neuron types within a relatively short time window (<a href=\"#bib16\">Frank and Sanes, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ma et al., 1999</a>), specification of the diverse DRG neuron subtypes mainly takes place in postmitotic neurons. Therefore, DRG sensory neurons are particularly well suited for mechanistic studies of postmitotic differentiation of neuronal subtypes."

These two nociceptor subtypes are molecularly, morphologically and functionally distinct. Peptidergic nociceptors are traditionally defined by expression of neuropeptides, such as CGRP and Substance P, while the majority of nonpeptidergic nociceptors have binding sites for the lectin IB4 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mulderry et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Silverman and Kruger, 1990</a>). More recently, a single cell transcriptome analysis led to the identification of four molecularly defined nonpeptidergic neuron subtypes (<a href=\"#bib51\">Usoskin et al., 2015</a>). Peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptor subtypes are further distinguished by their central and peripheral axonal projection patterns (<a href=\"#bib33\">Molliver et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zylka et al., 2005</a>). Functionally, nonpeptidergic and peptidergic nociceptors are preferentially required for mechanical and thermal nociception, respectively (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cavanaugh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">McCoy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mishra and Hoon, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Vulchanova et al., 2001</a>)."

A key developmental event that defines the segregation of nociceptor subtypes is the nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific switch from NGF responsiveness to glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligand (GFL) responsiveness. This occurs by virtue of the upregulation of Ret and GDNF family <i>receptor alpha receptors (</i>GFR\u03b1), receptor components for GFL signaling, in nonpeptidergic nociceptors starting from E15.5, as well as postnatal extinction of TrkA expression (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bennett et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bennett et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Molliver and Snider, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Molliver et al., 1997</a>). Interestingly, both NGF\u2013TrkA and GFL\u2013GFR\u03b1/Ret signaling are essential for postmitotic differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. Indeed, NGF\u2013TrkA signaling is required for the acquisition of virtually all nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific features, including expression of <i>Ret</i> and <i>Gfra</i>s, whereas GFL\u2013GFR\u03b1/Ret signaling, in turn, plays a critical role in postnatal development of nonpeptidergic nociceptors, including expression of a subset of genes characteristic of mature nonpeptidergic nociceptors (<a href=\"#bib28\">Luo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Patel et al., 2000</a>). The mechanism by which NGF\u2013TrkA signaling governs differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors is unclear."

Most prominent is Runx1, a Runx family transcription factor whose expression is primarily restricted to nonpeptidergic nociceptors.

In mammals, Runx family proteins, which include Runx1, Runx2 and Runx3, are key regulators of hematopoietic, osteogenic, and immune cell lineages (<a href=\"#bib2\">Banerjee et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">de Bruijn and Speck, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ducy et al., 1997</a>). In those systems, Runx proteins function as heterodimers by forming complexes with CBF\u03b2, a non-DNA-binding cofactor that enhances the DNA binding affinity and protein stability of Runx proteins (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adya et al., 2000</a>). In the peripheral nervous system, genetic ablation of Runx1 leads to a near complete loss of nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific features and a concomitant expansion of neurons exhibiting a peptidergic nociceptor-like phenotype (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kramer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Yoshikawa et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, the dramatic consequences of NGF deficiency on nonpeptidergic-specific gene expression resemble those seen upon Runx1 ablation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Luo et al., 2007</a>). This observation suggests a potential interaction between the extrinsic signal NGF and the intrinsic factor Runx1 during nonpeptidergic nociceptor development and thus an opportunity to define mechanisms of interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors during postmitotic neuronal differentiation."

The phenotypic similarity exhibited by mice lacking NGF and those lacking Runx1 raises the intriguing possibility that NGF and Runx1 function in a common signaling pathway to control nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. To address this, we assessed the extent to which initiation of the nonpeptidergic phenotype is co-dependent on NGF and Runx1 during early stages of nociceptor development. We first sought to extend our understanding of Runx1-dependent nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific genes using unbiased gene expression profiling of DRGs from <i>Wnt1-Cre; Runx1<sup>f/f </sup>(Runx1 CKO</i>) mice, previously characterized neural crest-specific <i>Runx1</i> conditional mutants and their littermate controls at E16.5, the onset of nonpeptidergic-specific gene expression (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2006</a>). Among the many genes with downregulated expression in <i>Runx1CKO</i> DRGs compared to controls, <i>Ptprt, Myo1a</i>, and <i>Kif21b</i> were shown to exhibit strong Runx1 dependence by in situ hybridization analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1O\u2013T</a>). Further co-localization studies with Runx1 confirmed that their expression is primarily restricted to nonpeptidergic nociceptors (data not shown). We next compared the patterns of expression of these as well as additional, canonical nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific genes between <i>Runx1 CKO</i> mice and mice lacking NGF at the same developmental stages by in situ hybridization. In order to study survival-independent functions of NGF, nociceptors are kept alive in the absence of NGF by co-deletion of <i>Ngf</i> and the proapoptotic gene <i>Bax (Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/- </sup></i>mice) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Patel et al., 2000</a>). In accordance with previous observations, expression of the nonpeptidergic nociceptor markers<i> Mrgprd</i> and <i>Gfra2 </i>was almost completely abolished in presumptive nonpeptidergic nociceptors of both <i>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Runx1 CKO</i> mice at P0 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013D, K\u2013N</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Luo et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, newly identified nonpeptidergic-specific genes, including <i>Ptprt, Myo1a</i>, and <i>Kif21b</i>, exhibited dramatically reduced expression in neurons that would normally become nonpeptidergic nociceptors in <i>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice compared to littermate controls at P0 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013J</a>), in a manner similar to that observed in <i>Runx1 CKO</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1O\u2013T</a>). Furthermore, impairment in expression of <i>Mrgprd, Ptprt, Myo1a</i>, and <i>Kif21b</i> was observed in <i>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Runx1 CKO</i> mice as early as E16.5, which is when their expression is normally initiated (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As expected, expression of <i>Gfra2, Myo1a</i>, and <i>Kif21b</i> in non-nociceptors was unaffected in <i>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Runx1 CKO </i>mice, thus explaining the residual expression observed in these mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D, N</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F, H, N, P</a>). These results together demonstrate a general requirement of both NGF and Runx1 for initiation of expression of a large subset of nonpeptidergic neuron genes."

Alternatively, Runx1 may indirectly control nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation by facilitating NGF signaling. In fact, the level of NGF signaling, as assessed by the fluorescent intensity of phospho-Trk (pTrk) immunostaining, is lower in <i>Runx1 CKO</i> DRG neurons relative to controls at P0 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013F</a>). This ability of Runx1 to sustain normal levels of TrkA activity is not simply due to an effect on TrkA expression, as TrkA levels in control and <i>Runx1 CKO</i> DRGs are indistinguishable, as determined by immunohistochemistry (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G, H</a>). However, since <i>Ret</i> expression, which is strongly dependent on NGF signaling in nonpeptidergic nociceptors, appears normal at E16.5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D, E</a>), it is unlikely that diminished NGF signaling observed at P0 accounts for the profound deficits in initiation of expression of nonpeptidergic-specific genes in E16.5 <i>Runx1 CKO</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Nevertheless, to directly test the possibility that Runx1 controls maturation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors solely by modulating NGF signaling, we asked whether exogenous NGF can rescue nonpeptidergic nociceptor gene expression deficits in <i>Runx1 CKO</i> DRGs. This was addressed in two ways. First, the consequence of excess NGF was evaluated in vivo by in situ hybridization and real-time PCR analysis following intraperitoneal injections of NGF into neonatal mice. With the notable exception of <i>Ret</i>, whose expression was partially restored following NGF injection into <i>Runx1 CKO</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J\u2013L</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>), we found a general and complete lack of effect of NGF administration on expression of nonpeptidergic-specific genes in <i>Runx1 CKO</i> DRGs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013I</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). In a second series of experiments, dissociated DRG cultures from P0 control and <i>Runx1 CKO</i> animals were incubated in the presence or absence of NGF, and the effects of NGF on nonpeptidergic-specific gene expression were assessed by real-time PCR. Importantly, NGF treatment led to a robust increase in expression of the nonpeptidergic-specific genes, <i>Mrgprd, Gfra2</i>, and <i>Ptprt</i>, in wildtype neurons but not in Runx1-deficient neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2M\u2013O</a>). In contrast, <i>Ret</i> expression was NGF-dependent in both control and Runx1-deficient neurons, albeit to a lesser extent in the absence of Runx1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3P</a>). Taken together, these findings are most consistent with a model in which Runx1 primarily acts downstream of NGF to control the initiation of expression of nonpeptidergic-specific genes."

To address the mechanism by which Runx1 activity may be modulated by NGF, it was critical to first ask how Runx1 activity is normally controlled in DRG neurons. Outside of the nervous system, Runx family transcription factors function as heterodimers, forming complexes with a common non-DNA-binding cofactor CBF\u03b2. CBF\u03b2 is indispensable for Runx1 activity in cells of the hematopoietic lineage because of its role in enhancing the DNA-binding activity and stability of Runx1 proteins (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adya et al., 2000</a>). Therefore, we asked whether CBF\u03b2 plays a similar role in DRG neurons to promote Runx1 function."

In situ hybridization analysis revealed that <i>Cbfb</i> is expressed at varying levels, in the majority, if not all, DRG neurons over the entire time course of our analysis (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). Due to a lack of CBF\u03b2 antibodies that work reliably for immunohistochemistry, we generated a <i>Cbfb<sup>Flag</sup></i> knockin mouse line, in which N-terminally Flag-tagged CBF\u03b2 protein (Flag-CBF\u03b2) is produced from the endogenous <i>Cbfb</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In<i> Cbfb<sup>Flag</sup></i> mice, the Flag antibody allows for specific detection of endogenous Flag-CBF\u03b2, which appears to be expressed in nearly all DRG neurons, at varying levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, B</a>). Double labeling of Flag and Runx1 showed overlap between CBF\u03b2 and Runx1 throughout nociceptor development suggesting a potential interaction between these two proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013G</a>). It is noteworthy that CBF\u03b2 is broadly expressed and found in more than just Runx1<sup>+</sup> neurons, suggesting additional Runx1-independent CBF\u03b2 functions in the DRG (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a>). To test for a direct physical interaction between Runx1 and CBF\u03b2 in DRG neurons, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were done using a Flag antibody and extracts from DRGs of P0 <i>Cbfb<sup>Flag/Flag</sup></i> animals and wildtype littermate controls. Indeed, Runx1 is enriched in Flag immunoprecipitates from <i>Cbfb<sup>Flag/Flag</sup></i> animals but not wildtype animals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>).

Effective gene ablation in the DRG was achieved by crossing mice harboring the <i>Cbfb<sup>f</sup></i> allele to a <i>Wnt1-Cre</i> mouse line, which drives recombination specifically in the dorsal neural tube and neural crest derivatives (Danielian et al., 1998) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B, C</a>). Analysis of <i>Wnt1-Cre; Cbfb<sup>f/f</sup> (Cbfb CKO</i>) animals revealed a wide range of nonpeptidergic nociceptor phenotypes that are virtually identical to those seen in <i>Runx1 CKO </i>mice. Specifically, those genes found to be Runx1-dependent similarly require CBF\u03b2 for normal expression, as shown by in situ hybridization and real-time PCR analysis at P0 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013J</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D, E</a>). As has been shown for <i>Runx1 CKO</i> animals, expression of CGRP, a marker of peptidergic nociceptors, was de-repressed in <i>Cbfb CKO</i> animals (data not shown). Furthermore, like <i>Runx1 CKO</i> mice,<i> Cbfb CKO</i> animals at P0 exhibited a marked reduction of sensory innervation of the epidermis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K\u2013P</a>). This defect was primarily due to a deficiency in the peripheral projections of nonpeptidergic nociceptors, considering the sparseness of epidermal innervation by peptidergic nociceptors at P0 as well as their unperturbed innervation pattern in the absence of CBF\u03b2 (data not shown). We also found that the subepidermal nerve plexus is unaffected in <i>Cbfb CKO</i> mice, indicating a developmental defect in the final stage of peripheral target innervation. Therefore, both molecular and morphological features of nonpeptidergic nociceptors critically depend on both Runx1 and CBF\u03b2 during embryonic development."

Specifically, key features of C-LTMRs, including TH expression and longitudinal lanceolate endings in the periphery, as marked by expression of a Cre-dependent GFP reporter (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</a>), are nearly completely absent in mice lacking Runx1 or CBF\u03b2 at postnatal time points (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013M</a>).

                                "text": "How does NGF control Runx1/CBF\u03b2 activity? Since Runx1 and CBF\u03b2 are both necessary for nonpeptidergic neuron maturation, NGF could, in principle, control Runx1/CBF\u03b2 function by promoting the activity of Runx1, CBF\u03b2 or both. Considering the profound requirement of NGF for nonpeptidergic nociceptor gene expression, one possibility is that NGF promotes expression of <i>Runx1, Cbfb</i>, or both, thereby enabling Runx1/CBF\u03b2 complex formation, stabilization and function, and thus initiation of the nonpeptidergic nociceptor fate. We therefore examined expression of both <i>Cbfb </i>and<i> Runx1 </i>in DRGs of control and <i>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals before and during the acquisition of the nonpeptidergic nociceptor fate. Interestingly, <i>Cbfb</i> expression was found to be sensitive to loss of NGF prior to specification of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. In fact, at E14.5, a time prior to expression of nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific genes, <i>Cbfb</i> mRNA expression was significantly reduced in<i> Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> DRGs relative to controls, specifically in small-diameter nociceptor precursors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A, B, E</a>). This <i>Cbfb</i> expression deficit in <i>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> small diameter DRG neurons becomes much more pronounced at later time stages, such as E16.5, the onset of observable deficits in nonpeptidergic-specific gene expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a>). Similarly, <i>Ntrk1<sup>-/-</sup>/Bax<sup>-/- </sup></i>DRGsdisplayed reduced levels of <i>Cbfb</i> expression at P0 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H, I</a>). The deficit of <i>Cbfb</i> mRNA expression was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Considering the inability of this assay to distinguish between <i>Cbfb</i> expressed in nociceptors and that expressed in NGF-independent DRG neurons, such as proprioceptors, and non-neuronal cells of the ganglion, it is noteworthy that the real-time PCR measurements are an underestimation of the NGF dependence of <i>Cbfb</i> expression in developing nociceptors. We further addressed NGF-dependence of <i>Cbfb</i> expression at the protein level in two ways. First, Flag immunostaining on dissociated DRG cultures from P0 <i>Cbfb<sup>Flag/+ </sup></i> animals showed that NGF is essential for CBF\u03b2 protein expression in vitro (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F\u2013H</a>). Second, when DRGs from P0 control and <i>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals that were also heterozygous for the <i>Cbfb<sup>Flag</sup></i> allele were acutely dissociated, the level of Flag immunoreactivity was significantly lower in <i>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> neurons compared to controls, suggesting NGF-dependence of CBF\u03b2 protein expression in vivo (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). <i>Cbfb </i>is also sensitive to the dose of NGF as exogenous NGF administered to wildtype neonates via intraperitoneal injection further potentiated <i>Cbfb</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Together<i>, </i>these findings identify NGF as a key regulator of <i>Cbfb</i> expression prior to the initiation of NGF-dependent nonpeptidergic-specific gene expression. On the other hand, <i>Runx1</i> mRNA levels are normal in <i>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> DRGs at E14.5, as determined by both in situ hybridization and real-time PCR analysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I, J, M</a>), consistent with our previous observation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Luo et al., 2007</a>). It is only at later times, beginning at E16.5, that <i>Runx1</i> expression becomes affected, suggesting a late requirement of NGF for maintenance of <i>Runx1</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K\u2013M</a>). Consistent with the late NGF dependence of <i>Runx1</i> mRNA expression, Runx1 protein expression is unaffected in <i>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> DRGs at E14.5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6N, O, R, S</a>). At E16.5, the level of Runx1 protein is significantly diminished without any change in the number of Runx1<sup>+ </sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6P\u2013S</a>). In view of the discrepancy between the dramatic nonpeptidergic phenotypes at E16.5 and the relatively modest deficit in <i>Runx1</i> expression at this time, upregulation of <i>Cbfb</i> expression by NGF is likely to be an important mechanism by which NGF enables Runx1 function during nonpeptidergic nociceptor development."

                                "text": "To better understand the mechanism by which NGF controls <i>Cbfb</i> expression in nociceptor precursors, we next sought to identify NGF\u2013TrkA signaling cascades that control <i>Cbfb</i> expression. The canonical ERK1/2 signaling cascade represents a likely candidate because this is a major NGF\u2013TrkA effector pathway, and animals deficient in components of this pathway exhibit nonpeptidergic phenotypes, including reduced <i>Ret </i>expression, impaired innervation of the epidermis, and impaired adult CBF\u03b2 protein expression (<a href=\"#bib39\">Newbern et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhong et al., 2007</a>). To directly assess the role of MAPK signaling in NGF-dependent <i>Cbfb</i> expression during development, both in vitro and in vivo approaches were used. Through immunostaining and immunoblot analysis, we found that pharmacological inactivation of Mek1/2, direct activators of ERK1/2, greatly attenuated the ability of NGF to promote CBF\u03b2 protein expression in vitro (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). A <i>Nestin-Cre</i>-based conditional knockout mouse model, which targets all four <i>Mapk3, Mapk1, Map2k1</i>and<i> Map2k2 </i>alleles, was next used to determine the in vivo role of MAPK signaling for <i>Cbfb</i> expression. Using this in vivo model system, we found that in 4 out of 5 P0 <i>Nes-Cre; Map2k1<sup>f/f;</sup>Map2k2<sup>-/-</sup>; Mapk3<sup>-/-</sup>; Mapk1<sup>f/f </sup></i>mutants (<i>Quadruple), Cbfb</i> mRNA expression was severely disrupted, demonstrating a strong dependence of <i>Cbfb</i> expression on MAPK signaling in vivo (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F, G</a>). The phenotypic variation in this analysis likely reflects incomplete excision of all four floxed alleles. We next asked whether MAPK signaling is sufficient to promote <i>Cbfb </i>expression in vivo, in the absence of NGF or activation of other NGF-dependent signaling pathways. For this analysis, a constitutively active form of B-Raf (V600E) was expressed exclusively in the nervous system to drive MAPK signaling in animals that were null for both <i>Ntrk1</i> and <i>Bax</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">O'Donovan et al., 2014</a>). Remarkably, while <i>Cbfb</i> expression in <i>Ntrk1<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> DRGs was severely impaired, expression of B-Raf<sup>V600E</sup> in <i>Ntrk1<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice to promote constitutive MAPK signaling restored <i>Cbfb</i> expression to near normal levels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H\u2013J</a>). Real-time PCR analysis was carried out as an independent measure of <i>Cbfb</i> expression to further confirm the necessity and sufficiency of MAPK signaling for <i>Cbfb</i> expression in vivo (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K</a>). Together, these findings indicate that the ERK/MAPK signaling cascade is both necessary and sufficient to mediate NGF/TrkA-dependent expression of <i>Cbfb.</i>"

We tested the involvement of Islet1, a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, because in a neural crest derivative-specific <i>Islet1</i> mutant (<i>Isl1 CKO</i>), a Runx1 protein deficit was noted as early as E12.5, the time when Runx1 proteins are first detected in lumbar DRGs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dykes et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sun et al., 2008</a>). To define the level at which <i>Runx1</i> expression is regulated by Islet1, <i>Runx1</i> expression was evaluated by in situ hybridization analysis in DRGs of E12.5 control and <i>Isl1 CKO</i> animals. Consistent with a central role for Islet in initiating <i>Runx1</i> expression at the transcriptional level, <i>Runx1</i> transcripts were virtually undetectable in <i>Isl1 CKO</i> DRGs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A, B</a>). In contrast, <i>Cbfb</i> expression was only minimally affected by the same genetic perturbation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C, D</a>). The distinct dependence of <i>Runx1</i> and <i>Cbfb</i> expression on Islet1 was confirmed by a microarray analysis of control and <i>Isl1 CKO</i> DRGs at E12.5 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Thus, expression of Runx1 and CBF\u03b2, obligatory components of a transcription factor holocomplex, are under differential control of Islet1 and NGF; <i>Runx1</i> and <i>Cbfb </i>at early stages of nonpeptidergic nociceptor differentiation are preferentially regulated by the intrinsic cue Islet1 and the extrinsic cue NGF, respectively. Thus, a convergence of intrinsic and extrinsic signaling events in nonpeptidergic nociceptor progenitors enables formation of the Runx1/CBF\u03b2 transcription factor complex, a key event required for nonpeptidergic nociceptor differentiation."

At the core of this process is the formation of the Runx1/CBF\u03b2 transcription factor complex, both components of which are essential for directing the nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific transcriptional program. Importantly, expression of each component is independently regulated at the transcriptional level. <i>Cbfb</i> expression is controlled by the extrinsic cue NGF through the MAPK signaling pathway. On the other hand, <i>Runx1</i> expression is initiated by a mechanism that is critically dependent on Islet1, an intrinsic factor that controls early development of sensory neurons. Furthermore, the Runx1/CBF\u03b2 complex, through an unknown mechanism, maintains a high level of NGF-TrkA signaling, which is essential for at least one defining feature of nonpeptidergic nociceptors: postnatal expression of<i> Ret</i>. Thus, the initiation of a lineage-specific differentiation program is tightly controlled by a convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic factors at the level of formation of the heterodimeric Runx1/CBF\u03b2 transcription factor complex (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>)."

The Runx1/CBF\u03b2 holocomplex therefore serves as a coincidence detector for extrinsic and intrinsic signals that promote specification of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. The requirement for NGF, an extrinsic cue that is critical for survival of all nociceptors, ensures that only those nociceptor precursors that gain access to a sufficient amount of NGF and survive the period of naturally occurring cell death will undergo nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. Consistent with this, <i>Cbfb</i> expression exhibits NGF dependence at E14.5, immediately following the period of naturally occurring cell death. On the other hand, the dependence of <i>Runx1</i> expression on Islet1, a transcription factor required for terminating expression of genes whose expression is restricted to the early stage of sensory neurogenesis, likely contributes to the orderly transition from pan-sensory neurogenesis to specification of nonpeptidergic nociceptors by ensuring that <i>Runx1</i> expression and hence Runx1/CBF\u03b2-dependent nonpeptidergic nociceptor development are initiated after sensory neurogenesis (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sun et al., 2008</a>). Thus the NGF and Islet1 signals coordinate temporal control of the Runx1/CBF\u03b2 complex for timely initiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptor differentiation. It is important to note that the extrinsic and intrinsic signals described here are unlikely to be sufficient to instruct Runx1/CBF\u03b2 complex formation and the nonpeptidergic nociceptor lineage choice, as neither NGF nor Islet1 functions exclusively in nonpeptidergic nociceptors. Indeed, NGF\u2013TrkA signaling is required for survival, target innervation and normal phenotypic development of both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors (<a href=\"#bib17\">Harrington and Ginty, 2013</a>), and Islet1 is expressed broadly in developing DRG neurons and is required for the generation of virtually all nociceptors (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sun et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, one or more additional, unidentified signals must govern the divergence of the two main nociceptive lineages."

The generality of MAPK signaling suggests that it plays a similar role in controlling <i>Cbfb </i>expression in cells outside of the nervous system and thus MAPK\u2013CBF\u03b2 signaling may have a general role in cell type specification. Moreover, the identification of MAPK as an upstream activator of <i>Cbfb</i> expression may provide an explanation for the observation that <i>Cbfb</i>, unlike <i>Runx</i> genes, is widely expressed (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 1993</a>). The identity of nuclear targets of the MAPK signaling pathway that directly activate <i>Cbfb</i> expression remains unclear. To this end, we found, through bioinformatic analysis of the putative <i>Cbfb</i> promoter, cAMP-response element (CRE) consensus motifs within an evolutionally conserved 458 bp enhancer-like element (data not shown), raising the intriguing possibility that CREB family members, which are well-studied downstream mediators of MAPK signaling in many cell types (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shaywitz and Greenberg, 1999</a>), are direct transcriptional activators of <i>Cbfb. </i>In view of the role of CREB family members in NGF-dependent growth and survival of neurons (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Riccio et al., 1999</a>), the possibility of CREB-mediated activation of <i>Cbfb</i> expression would further suggest that common effectors of growth factor signaling pathways support distinct biological outcomes, in this case, survival, axon growth and maturation of nociceptors, presumably by controlling expression of distinct target genes."

It is important to note the distinction between this relatively late developmental process and the specification of progenitor domains, which takes place prior to cell cycle exit. While it is well established in vertebrate systems that specification of progenitor domains is coordinately regulated by the intrinsically defined competence state of a progenitor and spatially and temporally controlled extrinsic signals (<a href=\"#bib4\">Briscoe and Novitch, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Livesey and Cepko, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Molyneaux et al., 2007</a>), relatively little is known about the contributions of extrinsic cues, intrinsic factors, and their modes of interaction, during postmitotic specification of neuronal subtypes. The gene regulatory mechanism described here leads us to propose a simple model in which convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic signals onto a single heterodimeric transcription factor complex controls lineage-specific differentiation programs and postmitotic specification of neuronal subtypes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). It is conceivable that this simple model is generally applicable to a broad range of neuronal subtypes that rely on heterodimeric transcription factor complexes for their specification."

                                "text": "For the <i>Cbfb<sup>f</sup>\u00a0</i>allele, a ~2 kb sequence (chromosome 8: 105169674- 105171592) corresponding to a 1 kb sequence immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site as well as exon 1 and exon 2 of the <i>Cbfb</i> locus was flanked by two <i>loxP</i> sites. Recombineering technology was used to generate the targeting vector (<a href=\"#bib7\">Copeland et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Liu et al., 2003</a>). Briefly, a 129/SvJ BAC clone containing the targeted region of the <i>Cbfb</i> gene was obtained from Geneservice. An 11.5 kb region (chromosome 8: 105168174-105179387) with homology arms that were 1.5 kb and 8 kb long was inserted into a PBS-DTA plasmid, the backbone for the final targeting vector, via the first recombineering step. The 3\u2019 <i>loxP</i> site and the <i>FRT-Neo-FRT-</i>5\u2019<i> loxP</i> cassette were then introduced sequentially during subsequent recombineering steps. A Bstz171 restriction site was engineered 3\u2019 to the 3\u2019 <i>loxP </i>site to facilitate southern screening of ES cells. The targeting construct was linearized with KpnI and then electroporated into mouse 129S6SvEvTac ES cells. ES clones were screened by PCR and correctly targeted ES clones were confirmed by southern blot hybridization using both 5\u2019 and internal probes following Bstz171 digestion (WT 9.8 kb and Mutant 6.8 kb, data not shown). Chimeric <i>Cbfb<sup>f</sup>\u00a0</i>mice were produced by injection of positive ES cells into C57Bl/6 blastocysts. Mice carrying the <i>Cbfb<sup>f</sup></i> allele were subsequently generated by mating chimeric mice to germ-line <i>FlpE</i> mice to remove the <i>Neo </i>cassette (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rodriguez et al., 2000</a>). <i>Cbfb<sup>f</sup></i> mice were genotyped using a 2-primer PCR reaction with the following primers: 5\u2019-GCGCGCCAGTCACTTGTT-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-AAACCATCCCACGAACCGAACCAT-3\u2019. The sizes of PCR products from wildtype and mutant alleles are 219 bp and 324 bp, respectively. For the <i>Cbfb<sup>Flag</sup></i> allele, the targeting vector, which was nearly identical to that of the <i>Cbfb<sup>f</sup>\u00a0</i>vector, was generated using a combination of recombineering and standard subcloning strategies. The same targeted genomic region was engineered to include the <i>FRT-Neo-FRT-loxP</i> cassette\u00a0at the position identical to that in the <i>Cbfb<sup>f</sup>\u00a0</i>allele, using recombineering technology. The\u00a0sequence encoding one Flag epitope was introduced into the vector immediately upstream of the translational start site of the <i>Cbfb</i> gene by replacing a 1.1 kb NotI/AvrII fragment containing the\u00a0translational start site with the fragment carrying the insertion using standard cloning techniques.\u00a0A Bstz171 restriction site was inserted immediately downstream of the <i>Flag</i> sequence for the purpose\u00a0of southern screening. Subsequent steps for generation of <i>Cbfb<sup>Flag</sup></i> mice were the same as\u00a0those\u00a0described above for <i>Cbfb<sup>f</sup></i> mice. <i>Cbfb<sup>Flag </sup></i>mice were genotyped using a 2-primer PCR\u00a0reaction with the following primers: 5\u2019-TGAGAGCTGTCTATGGCAAAC-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-TCAGTTCAAGGATGGCAGGTA-3\u2019. The sizes of PCR products from wildtype and mutant alleles are 232 bp and 336 bp, respectively."

Area fraction for each image was considered an individual data point for statistical analysis. For quantifying the intensity of fluorescent images, images except those of cultured neurons were thresholded and regions of interest were defined either on a cell-by-cell basis or as populations of cells. The mean or total intensity of pixels above threshold was measured. For cultured neurons, the total intensity of pixels within each neuron was measured without thresholding.
