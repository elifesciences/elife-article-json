Here we show that AITC (allyl isothiocyanate; mustard oil) and menthol represent two distinct types of ligands at the mammalian cold sensor TRPM8. Kinetic analysis of channel gating revealed that AITC acts by destabilizing the closed channel, whereas menthol stabilizes the open channel, relative to the transition state. Based on these differences, we classify agonists as either type I (menthol-like) or type II (AITC-like), and provide a kinetic model that faithfully reproduces their differential effects. We further demonstrate that type I and type II agonists have a distinct impact on TRPM8 currents and TRPM8-mediated calcium signals in excitable cells. These findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding the differential actions of TRP channel ligands, with important ramifications for TRP channel structure-function analysis and pharmacology."

Here we show that AITC (allyl isothiocyanate; mustard oil) and menthol represent two distinct types of ligands at the mammalian cold sensor TRPM8. Kinetic analysis of channel gating revealed that AITC acts by destabilizing the closed channel, whereas menthol stabilizes the open channel, relative to the transition state. Based on these differences, we classify agonists as either type I (menthol-like) or type II (AITC-like), and provide a kinetic model that faithfully reproduces their differential effects. We further demonstrate that type I and type II agonists have a distinct impact on TRPM8 currents and TRPM8-mediated calcium signals in excitable cells. These findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding the differential actions of TRP channel ligands, with important ramifications for TRP channel structure-function analysis and pharmacology."

Janssens, Gees, Toth et al. investigated how menthol, and another natural compound called mustard oil, influence the opening of TRPM8. The experiments show that menthol and mustard oil both stimulate sensory neurons by opening the TRPM8 ion channel, but using different mechanisms. Mustard oil forces the channel to open faster than it normally would, whereas menthol prevents the channel from closing. Further experiments show that these mechanisms explain why some compounds stimulate sensory neurons more strongly than others."

Within the somatosensory system, several members of the TRP superfamily of cation channels act as polymodal molecular sensors of both temperature, and a variety of endogenous and exogenous chemicals, including a plethora of plant-derived compounds (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clapham, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Tominaga et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Voets et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Vriens et al., 2014</a>). Chemical activation of TRP channels in nerve endings of trigeminal or dorsal root ganglion neurons is generally believed to underlie typical chemesthetic sensations evoked by such plant-derived substances (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bandell et al., 2007</a>), such as the burning heat evoked by capsaicin (the pungent substance in hot peppers), which acts as a selective agonist of the heat-activated TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Caterina et al., 1997</a>), and the cool sensation evoked by menthol (the cooling compound in mint plants), due to activation of the cold sensor TRPM8 (<a href=\"#bib25\">McKemy et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Peier et al., 2002</a>). Such TRP channel ligands are present in widely used foodstuffs and drugs (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nilius and Appendino, 2013</a>), and are extensively used as pharmacological tools to study somatosensation and/or TRP channel function in vitro and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib22\">Julius, 2013</a>). Yet, very little is known about the molecular and biophysical mechanisms of action of the various TRP channel ligands."

AITC is responsible for the characteristic oral sensations that one experiences upon eating Dijon mustard or wasabi, which contain between 5\u201330\u2009mM of AITC (<a href=\"#bib37\">Uematsu et al., 2002</a>). Whereas earlier work has firmly established that AITC activates TRPA1 and TRPV1 in nociceptor neurons, approximately 10% of dorsal root ganglion neurons remained AITC-responsive after combined genetic deletion these two TRP channels (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bandell et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bautista et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Everaerts et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jordt et al., 2004</a>). In this work we show that AITC excites this subset of somatosensory neurons via direct activation of TRPM8. Interestingly, a detailed biophysical analysis revealed that AITC activates TRPM8 by inducing a relative destabilization of the closed conformation relative to the transition state. This mode of action is fundamentally different from that of other known TRPM8 agonists such as menthol, which stabilize the open conformation relative to the transition state. Based on these results, we propose to classify TRPM8 agonists as either type I (menthol-like) or type II (AITC-like), and provide a kinetic model that accurately describes the differential actions of the two agonist types on channel gating kinetics. Finally, we illustrate that the two agonist types have a\u00a0distinct impact on TRPM8-mediated currents and calcium signals in excitable cells."

At room temperature, TRPM8 exhibits substantial activity, which can be recorded as an outwardly rectifying current (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Application of AITC at concentrations \u2265300\u2009\u03bcM caused a rapid and reversible increase in TRPM8 current (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The amplitude of the response increased with AITC concentration, with relatively stronger effects at negative voltages, but did not saturate at the highest concentration tested (10\u2009mM; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). At 3 and 10\u2009mM AITC, activation was followed by a gradual decay of TRPM8 current, reducing current amplitude to levels below the basal level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Following washout of 3 or 10\u2009mM AITC after prolonged exposure, we observed a rapid initial decrease in current followed by a gradual restoration of the current to the basal level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), suggesting that the agonistic effect of AITC reverses more rapidly than the inhibitory effect. Rapid and reversible current responses to AITC were also observed in cell-free inside-out patches from human TRPM8-expressing HEK293 cells, indicating that the effect of AITC on TRPM8 is membrane-delimited (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>)."

To test whether AITC-induced activation of TRPM8 also involves rapid translocation of the channel towards the plasma membrane, we expressed human TRPM8 coupled with mCherry at its C terminus (TRPM8-mCherry), and performed total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to monitor potential AITC-induced transport of TRPM8 towards the plasma membrane. We have recently shown that TRPM8-mCherry is fully functional, and can be used to track cellular TRPM8 transport (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ghosh et al., 2016</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>, application of 3\u2009mM AITC had no detectable effect on the TRPM8-mCherry fluorescence in the close vicinity of the plasma membrane. mCherry fluorescence amounted to 99 \u00b1 1% and 102 \u00b1 2% of the pre-AITC level after 5 and 50\u2009s of AITC application, respectively. Since the onset of current activation by AITC was very rapid, with maximal current achieved within ~2\u2009s (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,D</a>), we can exclude a significant contribution of trafficking to the acute agonistic effect of AITC on TRPM8."

The differential effects of the two ligand types on the gating kinetics suggest that they act on different conformational states of the channel during the gating process. In particular, the characteristic slowly decaying tail currents upon repolarization in the presence of menthol indicate that menthol impedes voltage-dependent channel deactivation, which points at a stabilization of the channel in an open conformation. Oppositely, the faster current relaxation upon depolarization in the presence of AITC indicates that AITC accelerates voltage-dependent channel activation, which points at a destabilization of the channel in a closed conformation."

We have shown earlier that this model can accurately describe the effect of menthol, voltage and temperature on steady-state TRPM8 currents (<a href=\"#bib20\">Janssens and Voets, 2011</a>). Moreover, based on analysis of channel chimeras with different combinations of wild type and mutated menthol binding sites, it was found that a single TRPM8 channel can bind up to four ligand molecules, each subunit having and ligand binding site with an affinity K<sub>d</sub> (in the closed state), and that every bound ligand shifts the equilibrium between the closed and open channel by a similar extent (<a href=\"#bib20\">Janssens and Voets, 2011</a>). The energetic effect of ligand binding can be quantified as \u0394\u0394G<sub>ligand</sub>, which represents the change of the difference in Gibbs free energy between the closed and open state of the channel (\u0394G) upon binding of one ligand molecule to one of the four subunits. In the case of an agonist, \u0394\u0394G<sub>ligand</sub> &lt; 0, which implies that the open state becomes more stable relative to the closed state. As illustrated by the energy diagrams in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>,\u00a0a negative \u0394\u0394G<sub>ligand</sub> can be the result of a ligand-induced relative stabilization of the open state, destabilization of the closed state, or a combination of both, taking the transition state as the reference. In the case of a relative stabilization of the open state, the energy barrier for the transition from open to closed will become higher, which would lead to slower closing rates, as seen with the Type I agonists (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Oppositely, relative destabilization of the closed state will reduce the energy barrier for the transition from closed to open, which would be reflected in faster opening rates, as seen with the Type II agonist AITC (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Off rates (k<sub>off</sub>) were constrained by the K<sub>d</sub> and on rates. Importantly, we obtained excellent fits to the experimental data when we set fixed that menthol binding acts exclusively by stabilization the open state, while AITC acts by destabilization of the closed state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Model parameters obtained from the fits are listed in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. Gratifyingly, the model accurately predicts the concentration-dependent effects of AITC and menthol on TRPM8, including the mono-exponential time constants in the presence of different AITC concentrations, as well as the bi-exponential relaxation kinetics in the presence of menthol, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Based on these results, we propose that AITC represents the first example of a type II TRPM8 agonist, acting primarily by destabilizing the closed channel, which contrasts to the Type I agonists, such as menthol, icilin, thymol and linalool, which primarily stabilize the open channel."

The differential effects of Type I and Type II agonists on the gating kinetics of TRPM8 suggest that they may have distinct effects on TRPM8-mediated currents and calcium signals during rapid neuronal action potentials. To investigate this possibility, we measured TRPM8 currents evoked by voltage waveforms mimicking action potentials in sensory neurons in the presence of AITC (3\u2009mM) or menthol (30 \u00b5M). Note that, at a physiological holding potential of \u221260 mV, these concentrations resulted in comparable steady-state inward current amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In response to the action potential waveforms, the current in the presence of AITC mainly manifested during the upstroke phase, and rapidly deactivates upon action potential repolarization. In comparison, in the presence of menthol, the peak outward current is smaller but a more prominent inward TRPM8 current is observed during the repolarization phase of the action potential (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). These differential effects of AITC and menthol on TRPM8 currents during an action potential are fully in line with the predictions of the MWC model for type I versus Type II agonists (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We also compared the cumulative influx and efflux of charge during a 1-s train of action potential waveforms at 8\u2009Hz, a typical firing rate of cold-sensitive neurons (<a href=\"#bib28\">Orio et al., 2012</a>). As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>, net charge influx is larger in the presence of menthol, whereas net charge efflux is larger in the presence of AITC."

Since our results indicated substantial differences in charge influx during action potentials between Type I and Type II agonists, we expected that menthol and AITC may show differential efficacy in evoking Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in excitable <i>versus</i> non-excitable cells. To test this, we compared the relative responses to menthol and AITC in TRPM8-expressing mouse sensory neurons <i>versus</i> (non-excitable) HEK293 cells heterologously expressing TRPM8. For these latter experiments, we used HEK293 cells transiently expressing the mouse TRPM8 orthologue, and first tested current responses to AITC. Like its human orthologue, mouse TRPM8 was rapidly activated by AITC, and the difference in gating kinetics in the presence of AITC <i>versus</i> menthol was also observed (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, interestingly, AITC-induced current inhibition was much less pronounced in mouse TRPM8 compared to the human orthologue (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>): at the end of a 60-s application of 3\u2009mM AITC, mouse TRPM8 current amounted to 88 \u00b1 6% (n\u00a0=\u00a08) of the peak current, compared to 21 \u00b1 5% in the case of human TRPM8 (n\u00a0=\u00a07; p=0.00004).

Likewise, the peak rate of calcium rise, which represents a measure for the maximal inward calcium current, was consistently smaller in response to AITC than to menthol in neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,D</a>). Interestingly, we observed an opposite potency of the same concentrations of menthol and AITC in HEK cells expressing mouse TRPM8: AITC evoked larger calcium increases and with a higher peak rate of calcium rise than did menthol (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,D</a>). Moreover, if action potential firing in the TRPA1/TRPV1-deficient sensory neurons was blocked using tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1\u2009\u03bcM), we found a similar ratio of AITC <i>versus</i> menthol responses as in HEK cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>), with AITC being slightly more potent than menthol. Taken together, these data provide further support for the notion that, compared to Type II agonists (e.g. AITC), Type I agonists (e.g. menthol) are more potent in evoking calcium influx in excitable cells, due to enhanced calcium influx during the prolonged inward tail currents following action potentials. In cells that do not fire action potentials, rapid changes in membrane potential are not expected, and hence the kinetic differences between the two types of agonists will not affect calcium signals."

Activation of TRPM8 by cooling or by known agonists such as the natural compounds menthol, thymol and linalool, and the synthetic agonists such as icilin and halothane, is associated with a slowing of the kinetics of voltage-dependent channel gating (<a href=\"#bib39\">Vanden Abeele et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Voets et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Voets et al., 2007</a>). This slowing of the gating kinetics can be directly explained by a stabilization of the open channel relative to the transition state, as we illustrated in this work for menthol and elsewhere for cooling (<a href=\"#bib40\">Voets et al., 2004</a>). In clear contrast, activation of TRPM8 by AITC resulted in an acceleration of the kinetics of voltage-dependent gating, and we show here that this can be fully explained by a mechanism where AITC leads to a relative destabilization of the closed conformation relative to the transition state. Based thereon, we propose that TRPM8 agonists can be classified as either Type I, causing a relative stabilization the open state, or Type II, causing a relative destabilization the closed state, and we provide a kinetic voltage-dependent Monod-Wyman-Changeux-type model that faithfully reproduces their differential agonist effects. Such classification may also be extended to activating ligands of other voltage- and ligand-sensitive TRP channels. For instance, published current traces suggest that activation of TRPV1 by capsaicin or low pH is associated with faster activation time courses upon depolarization (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aneiros et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Voets et al., 2004</a>), classifying them as Type II ligands, whereas the activating effects of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) or lysophosphatidic acid are associated with slower activation and longer deactivating tails upon repolarization, classifying them a Type I agonists (<a href=\"#bib26\">Nieto-Posadas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ufret-Vincenty et al., 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "The classification of activating ligands as either Type I or Type II is useful for several purposes. First, this information can provide important insights into ligand-induced structural rearrangements during channel gating, and may help interpreting ligand-bound channel structures. Indeed, our results indicate that Type II ligands such as AITC reduce the difference Gibbs free energy between the closed state and the transition state (\u0394G<sup>\u03b1\u2020</sup>), without affecting the difference Gibbs free energy between the open state and the transition state (\u0394G<sup>\u03b2\u2020</sup>). This suggests that the AITC-induced conformational change at its binding site occurs early in the gating process, prior to the main close-open transition. Oppositely, Type I ligands such as menthol cause an increase in \u0394G<sup>\u03b2\u2020</sup>, without affecting \u0394G<sup>\u03b1\u2020</sup>. This indicates that the menthol-induced conformational change at its binding sites occurs later than the main close-open transition. This analysis and interpretation is reminiscent of the rate-equilibrium free-energy relationship (REFER) approach, which has used to evaluate the effects of perturbations (e.g. ligands or mutations) on the equilibrium of reactions, including the gating of ion channels such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and CFTR (<a href=\"#bib18\">Grosman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sorum et al., 2015</a>). In REFER, the effect of a family of perturbations on channel gating is quantified using the \u03c6-value, which is the slope of a plot of the logarithm of the opening rate (log \u03b1) versus the log of the gating equilibrium constant (log K<sub>eq</sub>), where K<sub>eq</sub> is the ratio of the opening (\u03b1) and closing (\u03b2) rate (K<sub>eq</sub> = \u03b1/\u03b2) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Auerbach, 2007</a>). In the case of type I ligands, ligand binding affects the equilibrium solely by decreasing \u03b2, yielding \u03c6 = 0. Following the REFER theorem, this indicates late movement (<a href=\"#bib4\">Auerbach, 2007</a>). Type II ligands affect the equilibrium entirely by affecting \u03b1, yielding \u03c6 = 1, indicating early movement. We also found that the effects of simultaneously applied menthol and AITC on channel gating are well described assuming independent binding and additive effects on the gating equilibria, which further supports the notion that type I and type II ligands act at distant binding sites with different timing for conformational changes."

For example, for menthol binding we obtained a k<sub>on</sub> of 0.55\u2009\u03bcM<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>, which is well below the diffusion-limited rate (&gt;100\u2009\u03bcM<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>), and also one order of magnitude or more lower than binding rates for ligands to synaptic ligand-gated channels, such as the ionotropic receptors for glutamate (k<sub>on</sub>\u2248 5\u2009\u03bcM<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clements and Westbrook, 1991</a>), ATP (k<sub>on</sub>\u2248 12\u2009\u03bcM<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bean, 1990</a>) or acetylcholine (k<sub>on</sub>\u2248 60\u2009\u03bcM<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sine et al., 1990</a>). The relatively slow ligand equilibration kinetics for menthol are in line with the distinct structural properties of ligand binding sites in TRP channels compared to these classical ionotropic receptors. Indeed, whereas binding sites for glutamate, ATP and acetylcholine are located extracellularly (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hille, 2001</a>), directly accessible from the aqueous phase, the binding site for menthol is located in a hydrophobic domain in between the transmembrane helices (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bandell et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Voets et al., 2007</a>). The observation that current relaxation time courses of TRPM8 in the presence of menthol become multi-exponential is then a direct consequence of the slow equilibration rate of menthol with its binding site in comparison to the transition rates between closed and open channel conformations."

Indeed, as predicted by our model, the AITC-induced TRPM8 current during a typical action potential waveform mainly manifest during the upstroke phase, and rapidly deactivates upon action potential repolarization. In contrast, an equipotent concentration of menthol (i.e. a concentration of menthol provoking a similar steady-state current) results in a less outward current but more prominent activation of inward TRPM8 current during the repolarization phase following an action potential, and thus leads to more Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via TRPM8. In line herewith, we found that inhibiting action potential firing using TTX has a more profound effect on menthol-induced responses than on AITC-induced responses in sensory neurons. These findings illustrate the importance of evaluating the mode of action of ligands on voltage-dependent TRP channels, especially when extrapolating results from non-excitable heterologous expression systems to physiological effects in excitable cells such as neurons, cardiomyocytes or pancreatic beta cells."

Whereas this assumption is in line with the mono-exponential kinetics we generally observed in our experiments in the absence of ligands (<a href=\"#bib40\">Voets et al., 2004</a>), it is probably a simplification of the full gating intricacies of TRPM8, and models with one or more closed-closed transitions preceding channel opening have been proposed (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fernandez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Raddatz et al., 2014</a>). Nevertheless, even when using such more complex models, the ligands\u2019 effects on TRPM8 gating kinetics can only be explained assuming that Type II ligands cause acceleration of the gating transition(s) towards the open state, whereas Type I ligands slow down the backward rate(s) from the open state."

Under our experimental conditions, activation of TRPM8 by AITC only occurred in the high micromolar to millimolar concentration range. As such, TRPM8 is about two orders of magnitude less sensitive to AITC than TRPA1, for which concentrations for half-maximal activation of 5\u201350 \u00b5M have been reported (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bandell et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Everaerts et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jordt et al., 2004</a>), but comparable to TRPV1, for which a concentration for half-maximal activation of 3\u2009mM was found at room temperature (<a href=\"#bib15\">Everaerts et al., 2011</a>). These findings are in line with in vitro experiments in sensory neurons, showing that AITC concentrations \u2264100 \u00b5M evoke responses that are strictly TRPA1-dependent (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bautista et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Everaerts et al., 2011</a>), whereas higher concentrations can also evoke TRPA1-independent responses mediated by TRPV1 or TRPM8. AITC is extensively used in in vivo experiments to induce pain and inflammation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Julius, 2013</a>). In such assays, experimental solutions that are injected or topically applied typically contain AITC at concentrations between 10 and 100\u2009mM (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bautista et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Caterina et al., 2000</a>). Whereas earlier studies have clearly shown that pain and inflammatory responses under such experimental conditions are largely mediated by TRPA1 and TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bautista et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Everaerts et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kwan et al., 2006</a>), our present results suggest that also TRPM8-positive sensory nerve endings may become activated at these AITC doses. Since activation of TRPM8-expressing neurons can cause analgesia in animal models of acute and chronic pain (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Proudfoot et al., 2006</a>), the effects of AITC on TRPM8 that we describe here need to be taken into account when using AITC as a proalgesic and/or proinflammatory agent. TRPM8 may contribute to the complex psychophysical effects that one experiences upon eating spices containing millimolar concentrations of AITC such as mustard or wasabi (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nilius and Appendino, 2013</a>). In line herewith, a transient increase in cold sensitivity was observed upon application of 100\u2009mM AITC on the tongue of human volunteers (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albin et al., 2008</a>). Although speculative, this may correlate with the transient activation followed by channel inhibition that we observed in human TRPM8."

Briefly, to fit the gating behavior during voltage steps, eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the transition matrix were numerically solved using the <i>MatrixEigenV</i> operation, and used to calculate the sums of exponential terms describing the time-dependent changes of the probabilities that the channel is in one of the 10 states. The <i>FuncFit</i> and <i>DoNewGlobalFit</i> procedures were then used to find the model parameters that yield the best global fit to current relaxation time courses measured within one cell in the absence and presence of ligand (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The global kinetic fit included three free parameters: <math id=\"inf13\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math>, <math id=\"inf14\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b2</mi><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math> and k<sub>on</sub>. Prior to the kinetic fit, K<sub>d,ligand</sub> and \u0394\u0394G<sub>ligand</sub> were determined from steady-state currents, according to <a href=\"#equ9\">Equation 9</a>; k<sub>off</sub> was set as K<sub>d</sub>\u00d7 k<sub>on</sub>; z was fixed at a value of 0.82, based on earlier work (<a href=\"#bib42\">Voets et al., 2007</a>). We further assumed that the rate of ligand binding to the open and closed state of the channel were identical, whereas the rate of ligand unbinding from the closed state was constrained by detailed balance. The <i>integrateODE</i> operation was used to model TRPM8 currents during voltage steps or action potential waveforms, using mean parameters obtained from the fits (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

Comparison between two groups was done using Student\u2019s unpaired or paired test, as indicated. No explicit power analysis was performed prior to the experiments to determine sample size, since we had no means to reliably estimate the size and variability of the effects of the ligands on parameters of TRPM8 gating. For patch-clamp experiments on HEK cells, typically 5\u201310 cells were measured for each condition, thereby limiting the SEM to \u226420% of the mean value for the relevant parameters. For the calcium imaging experiments on mouse TG neurons, a maximal number of neurons from nine mice isolated on 5 independent days were analyzed. Since highly significant results were obtained from this set of experiments, no further animals were sacrificed."

The effects of the two agonists are compared using a broad range of experimental approaches, including kinetic analysis of current responses to voltage steps, analysis of charge flow during action potentials evoked by voltage clamp, and observation of time courses of intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in excitable and non-excitable cells. The key findings are that (i) AITC and menthol responses are strictly correlated in TRPV1/TRPA1-deficient neurons suggesting TRPM8 as a novel AITC target, (ii) AITC induces rapid activation followed by slow inactivation of heterologously overexpressed TRPM8, (iii) AITC-induced activation is rapidly, whereas inactivation is slowly reversible, (iv) menthol and AITC activate TRPM8 through distinct kinetic mechanisms, (v) these differential kinetic mechanisms of the two agonists result in differential rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, depending on the cell type (excitable vs. non-excitable)."

Exposure to AITC is shown to accelerate current relaxations in response to depolarizing, but not repolarizing, voltage steps. In contrast, menthol exposure slows current relaxations in response to voltage steps in both directions. Moreover, whereas current relaxation time courses in the presence of AITC remain reasonably monoexponential, they become multiexponential in the presence of menthol. The differential effects on relaxation rates are fully explained by assuming that AITC destabilizes the closed state, whereas menthol stabilizes the open state, with respect to the transition state. On the other hand, the mono- vs. multiexponential nature of the relaxation time courses are fully explained by assuming that the rates for binding/unbinding are rapid for AITC, but slow for menthol. These kinetic features allow the authors to define two classes (class I and II) of TRPM8 agonists."
