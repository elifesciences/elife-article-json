                    "text": "Visual pigments can be spontaneously activated by internal thermal energy, generating noise that interferes with real-light detection. Recently, we developed a physicochemical theory that successfully predicts the rate of spontaneous activity of representative rod and cone pigments from their peak-absorption wavelength (\u03bb<sub>max</sub>), with pigments having longer \u03bb<sub>max</sub> being noisier. Interestingly, cone pigments may generally be ~25 fold noisier than rod pigments of the same \u03bb<sub>max</sub>, possibly ascribed to an \u2018open\u2019 chromophore-binding pocket in cone pigments defined by the capability of chromophore-exchange in darkness. Here, we show in mice that the \u03bb<sub>max</sub>-dependence of pigment noise could be extended even to a mutant pigment, E122Q-rhodopsin. Moreover, although E122Q-rhodopsin shows some cone-pigment-like characteristics, its noise remained quantitatively predictable by the \u2018non-open\u2019 nature of its chromophore-binding pocket as in wild-type rhodopsin. The openness/closedness of the chromophore-binding pocket is potentially a useful indicator of whether a pigment is intended for detecting dim or bright light."

Recently, we developed a physicochemical theory that successfully predicts the rate of spontaneous activity of representative rod and cone pigments from their peak-absorption wavelength (\u03bb<sub>max</sub>), with pigments having longer \u03bb<sub>max</sub> being noisier. Interestingly, cone pigments may generally be ~25 fold noisier than rod pigments of the same \u03bb<sub>max</sub>, possibly ascribed to an \u2018open\u2019 chromophore-binding pocket in cone pigments defined by the capability of chromophore-exchange in darkness. Here, we show in mice that the \u03bb<sub>max</sub>-dependence of pigment noise could be extended even to a mutant pigment, E122Q-rhodopsin. Moreover, although E122Q-rhodopsin shows some cone-pigment-like characteristics, its noise remained quantitatively predictable by the \u2018non-open\u2019 nature of its chromophore-binding pocket as in wild-type rhodopsin. The openness/closedness of the chromophore-binding pocket is potentially a useful indicator of whether a pigment is intended for detecting dim or bright light."

These cells convert light energy into electrical signals that the brain then interprets to allow us to see. In this cell layer, the so-called cone cells work in bright light and provide us with the sense of color, whereas rod cells are for vision in dim light. Each visual pigment consists of a protein with a pocket-like space that holds a compound called a chromophore. Light causes the chromophore to change shape inside the pocket, which in turn activates the pigment. However, the pigments can also become activated at random, even in darkness. These false signals, nicknamed \u201cdark light\u201d, are caused by heat instead of light and essentially create a kind of visual noise that can interfere with vision."

The mutant pigment was more sensitive to light of shorter wavelengths and, importantly, it behaved like a cone pigment in some ways but kept the closed pocket that is found in rod pigments. Indeed,Yue, Frederiksen et al. showed that the noise level of this mutant pigment could be accurately predicted from the wavelength it was most sensitive to and how closed its pocket was (in other words, the pocket's \u201cclosedness\u201d). Further analyses revealed that an open pocket seems to be common to cone pigments from different species. So, it appears that cone pigments are noisier because they have a more open pocket, and the extra space might allow the chromophore to move around and change shape more easily."

At the pigment level, rod pigments have a low rate of spontaneous activation in darkness (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baylor et al., 1980</a>), thus offering a good signal-to-noise ratio for dim-light vision. Spontaneous activation originates from internal thermal energy of the pigment molecule, generating an electrical event indistinguishable from that triggered by an absorbed photon (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baylor et al., 1980</a>), thus interfering with real-light detection. Recently, <a href=\"#bib10\">Luo et al. (2011)</a> have developed a macroscopic physicochemical theory about pigment noise based on the notion that a pigment\u2019s spontaneous activity originates from thermal isomerization, with an energy barrier closely related to the pigment\u2019s \u03bb<sub>max</sub>. By using multi-vibrational-mode statistical mechanics (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ala-Laurila et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Hinshelwood, 1940</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib14\">St George, 1952</a>), the theory was able to explain quantitatively the \u03bb<sub>max</sub>-dependence of pigment noise, with the noise increasing by 10<sup>7</sup>-fold from blue (short-wavelength-sensitive, or SWS) cone pigment to red (long-wavelength-sensitive, or LWS) cone pigment (<a href=\"#bib4\">Fu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Kefalov et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Luo et al., 2011</a>). This theory clarifies the decades-long uncertainty about whether the spontaneous pigment activity arises from canonical isomerization of the pigment\u2019s chromophore (as in photoisomerization) or from some different, unknown chemical reaction."

The simplest interpretation is that a cone pigment has a higher molecular frequency of attempting to cross the isomerization barrier (<a href=\"#bib10\">Luo et al., 2011</a>). Concurrently, unlike rod pigment, a number of cone pigments show observable dark chromophore-exchange without isomerization when exposed to another chromophore (<a href=\"#bib8\">Kefalov et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Matsumoto et al., 1975</a>), suggesting a tendency of spontaneous dissociation between apo-cone-opsin and 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal by Schiff-base hydrolysis, in turn implicating the binding pocket being accessible \u2013 or \u2018open\u2019 \u2013 to external water. It was hypothesized that this \u2018openness\u2019 of cone pigments\u2019 chromophore-binding pocket \u2013 defined by the property of dark chromophore-exchange \u2013 imposes less constraint on the chromophore\u2019s attempts to isomerize spontaneously, resulting in a higher thermal noise compared to rod pigments for a given \u03bb<sub>max</sub> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Luo et al., 2011</a>)."

However, this test is non-trivial, requiring in each case a separate genetic mouse line expressing a test pigment for stringent interrogation in vivo. As such, the already-available <i>Rho<sup>E122Q/E122Q</sup></i> knock-in mouse (<a href=\"#bib6\">Imai et al., 2007</a>) offers an unusual opportunity. Its rods express a mutant rhodopsin with its Glu122 residue (conserved in rhodopsin) in the chromophore-binding pocket replaced by Gln, which is common in cone pigments. This E122Q mutation causes a blue-shift in \u03bb<sub>max</sub> to\u00a0~480 nm from\u00a0~500 nm in wild-type (WT) rhodopsin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Imai et al., 2007</a>), substantial enough for validating the quantitative connection between pigment noise and \u03bb<sub>max</sub>. Equally interestingly, this mutant rhodopsin has acquired some cone-pigment-like properties such as faster decays of the meta-II and meta-III states as well as a shift of the meta-I/meta-II equilibrium (<a href=\"#bib6\">Imai et al., 2007</a>), although retaining the indication of a closed chromophore-binding pocket as gleaned from in vitro experiments (<a href=\"#bib13\">Sakurai et al., 2007</a>). Thus, we can also check in this \u2018hybrid\u2019 pigment the correlation between pigment noise and openness/closedness of the chromophore-binding pocket as we hypothesized."

Expression levels of the pigment and other phototransduction components were also normal in mutant retinae based on Western blot analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). A normal expression level of the mutant pigment was further supported by electrophysiological measurements from single rods and by optical-density measurements by microspectrophotometry (Materials and methods). To measure pigment noise, we obtained\u00a0~10 min recordings in darkness from <i>Rho<sup>WT/WT</sup>;Gcaps<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Rho<sup>E122Q/E122Q</sup>;Gcaps<sup>-/-</sup></i> rods (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and extracted the spontaneous-activation rate by two methods. The first was to count quantal events based on a criterion amplitude of\u00a0&gt;30% of the single-photon-response amplitude measured in the same cell and also on a criterion integration time (reflecting its overall kinetics) of being within 50\u2013200% of that of the average dim-flash response (<a href=\"#bib4\">Fu et al., 2008</a>).

The measurements from <i>Rho<sup>WT/WT</sup>;Gcaps<sup>-/-</sup></i> rods matched previous estimates (<a href=\"#bib3\">Burns et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Fu et al., 2008</a>). A variation of this method (<a href=\"#bib10\">Luo et al., 2011</a>) allows us to also validate the Poisson occurrence of spontaneous events, by dividing the dark records into 100 s epochs and counting the number of epochs containing no event, one event, two events, etc. Indeed, the resulting probability histogram fits the Poisson distribution (red lines in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), with the probability, <i>p</i>(<i>u</i>), of observing <i>u</i> events in each epoch being given by <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>u</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msup><mi>w</mi><mi>u</mi></msup><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>\u2212</mo><mi>w</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><mo>/</mo><mrow><mi>u</mi><mo>!</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>, where <i>w</i> is the average number of events per epoch.

Given our hypothesis that the openness of a cone pigment\u2019s chromophore-binding pocket explains its higher spontaneous activity than that of rhodopsin of the same \u03bb<sub>max</sub>, we would like to check whether dark chromophore-exchange is indeed common also to other cone types. To avoid potential complications from in vitro conditions, we confined our question to live cells with microspectrophotometry, as described earlier and used previously on salamander red cones (<a href=\"#bib8\">Kefalov et al., 2005</a>). We decided to examine zebrafish, which has reasonably large cones of multiple spectral types. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> shows their single-cell absorption spectra: red (LWS), green (medium-wavelength-sensitive, or MWS), blue (SWS), and ultraviolet-sensitive (UVS). After dark incubation with 15 \u00b5M 9-<i>cis</i>-retinal for 3 hr, the absorption spectra of dark-adapted, native (11-<i>cis</i>) LWS, MWS and SWS cones all shifted to shorter wavelengths, indicating incorporation of 9-<i>cis</i>-retinal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, with native spectra shown in black and spectra after 3 hr incubation with 15 \u00b5M 9-<i>cis</i>-retinal shown in red). Because pigments with shorter \u03bb<sub>max</sub>\u2019s show smaller \u03bb<sub>max</sub>-differences between their 11-<i>cis</i>- and 9-<i>cis</i>-conjugated forms (the latter obtained by a full bleach followed by dark incubation with 9-<i>cis</i>; indicated in green in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), the absolute amount of spectral shift due to dark chromophore-exchange was smaller for MWS and SWS cones than for LWS cones and was too small to be resolved for UVS cones. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> shows the time course of dark chromophore-exchange for LWS cones, quantified by the degree of spectral shift (Materials and methods). A single-exponential fit to the collected data (mean \u00b1 SD, 20\u201322\u00b0C) gives a time constant of 37 min,\u00a0~4 fold faster than previously found for salamander red cones (<a href=\"#bib8\">Kefalov et al., 2005</a>), although the exchange in zebrafish did not appear to have reached completion (i.e.,&lt;100%, see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), possibly because of some 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal released from the pigment staying around and competing with the exogenous 9-<i>cis</i>-retinal. The time courses of dark chromophore-exchange for other zebrafish cone pigments were not well-resolved owing to the smaller spectral shift, but appeared to be faster at least for MWS and SWS cones, in that we found a significant shift to have occurred within the first 10 min of dark incubation (not shown). In contrast, zebrafish rhodopsin showed no obvious dark chromophore-exchange even after incubation with 9-<i>cis</i>-retinal for 6 hr (blue trace in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, rod panel), same as mouse rhodopsin. Thus, at least for salamander and zebrafish, dark chromophore-exchange appears to\u00a0be a general property for cone pigments with a time constant of the order of an hour, whereas rhodopsins behave quite differently. As such, we favor at present the simple approach of referring to these two collective groups of pigments as having \u2018open\u2019 versus \u2018closed\u2019 chromophore-binding pockets, respectively. If, in the future, the noise property and the pocket openness/closedness of a larger number of native and mutant pigments could be quantitatively measured, a finer sub-division may become more pertinent."

At the same time, our hypothesized correlation between closedness/openness of the chromophore-binding pocket and pigment noise level also continues to hold. A low level of pigment noise is without exception beneficial for dim-light vision. The successful application of our theory to E122Q-rhodopsin as a non-canonical pigment underscores the potential usefulness of evaluating a pigment as being intended for dim-light or bright-light function based on its noise level and, by extension, on the closedness/openness of its chromophore-binding pocket, provided the correlation between the two features continues to hold for other pigments. Such a functional criterion may be more informative than amino-acid-sequence comparison, especially for pigments with ambiguous evolutionary origin, such as the Gecko P467-pigment (<a href=\"#bib9\">Kojima et al., 1992</a>)."

Predictions were made by substituting these parameters and \u03bb<sub>max</sub> = 481 nm (for E122Q-rhodopsin) into <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>."

For each LWS cone, the spectrum acquired at each time point during 9-<i>cis</i> incubation was fitted in the 510\u2013750 nm range with a linear combination of the two polynomials to obtain the percentage of 9-<i>cis-</i>conjugated pigment.

The primary experimental system is a knockin/knockout mouse (<i>Rho<sup>E122Q/E122Q</sup>, Gcaps<sup>-/-</sup></i>) in which the usual wild-type rhodopsin (Rho) is replaced by the mutant Rho E122Q, which has been characterized in some detail earlier using a variety of methods. Much of the paper seems to be a reiteration of the earlier 2011 paper and the authors repeatedly refer to \"our\" theory or model even though it appears that only 2 of the 8 current authors were associated with the earlier work. Although this paper ascribes to being quantitative in presenting Rho E122Q is a definitive experimental example to validate the earlier theory paper, the claims of the paper are either too vague (for example, using ill-defined terms like \"openness\" of the retinal binding pocket), or too overreaching (for example, claiming that a single test case proves the earlier theory. In fact, it's not clear that the Rho E122Q mouse is a logical or sufficient model system for a variety of reasons. However, the data set is interesting and valuable and there are no major issues, but the authors should consider rewriting sections of the paper and should address a number of questions/concerns as outlined below:"

The trivial definition of \"open\" pocket refers to accessibility of the Schiff base to hydrolysis, for example by hydroxylamine (with a 1955 Wald reference), but the actual chemistry of the hydrolysis reaction is a very complicated pH dependent mechanism that is only partly dependent on accessibility or hydration state. It is not stated why the E122Q pigment is cone-like, or \"non-canonical.\" Some detail is required to justify its use, other than the mouse model happened to exist.

Also at the end of the subsection \u201cMeasurements of the rates of spontaneous activation\u201d, it is stated that the \"molecular rate constant could be obtained by further dividing the measured cellular rate by the number of pigment molecules per rod.\" Again, how is it assumed that E122Q is the same as Rho?"

This model is currently the dominant unifying theory correlating the two key functional properties of visual pigment molecules: their spectral sensitivity characterized by the peak-absorption wavelength (\u03bb<sub>max</sub>) and their susceptibility to thermal noise characterized by the rate of thermal isomerizations. The theory by Luo et al. proposes a similar dependency between the dark event rate and \u03bb<sub>max</sub> for rod and cone pigments. However, cone pigments with the same \u03bb<sub>max</sub> as rod pigments have overall 25-fold higher dark even rates according to measurements. In the model formulation, this has been implemented by using a pre-exponential factor that is 25-fold larger for cone pigments compared to rod pigments. This difference has been earlier hypothesized to relate to the closeness/openness of the chromophore-binding pocket (Ala-Laurila et al., 2004 &amp; Luo et al., 2011). The validity of this hypothesis has not been tested directly experimentally. The current paper tests the validity of this interpretation. The current paper uses a mutant rhodopsin (E122Q-rhodopsin) with some cone-like pigment properties (e.g. faster decay of rhodopsin intermediates, meta-II and meta-III) but with a rod-like chromophore exchange rate (correlated with the openness of the binding pocket). The paper shows that the dark-event rate of E122Q-rhodopsin is in accordance with the model prediction for a typical rod pigment. This result is in line with the proposed interpretation that the pre-exponential factor of the theory correlates with the accessibility of the chromophore binding pocket rather than some other features typical of cone pigments."

This is because of the nature of the model relying on multi-vibrational-mode statistical mechanics of visual pigment activation. Direct experimental testing of such molecular properties on a selection of pigments with different spectral properties seems very difficult. Instead, an approach testing the key predictions of the model by careful selections of pigments seems effective. This is exactly what has been done. In addition, the physiological experiments have been carefully carried out with the highest technical standards. Overall, this is a very important contribution to the field.

The authors claim that within the measured times there is no spectral shifts in E122Q-rods that have been exposed to 9-cis retinal. This data is used to conclude that the exchange rate is in line with rod pigments in E122Q-rods. The conclusion is central for the paper. It would be important to validate this argument by giving an estimate of the expected spectral shifts in MSP measurements for a chromophore exchange rate that is in line with that expected for cone-pigments in a similar time interval and relate this predicted shift to the accuracy of the \u03bb<sub>max</sub> measurements. This is needed to assess to which extent the MSP with its current measurement accuracy for \u03bb<sub>max</sub> is sensitive to the chromophore exchange rates representing rod and/or cone type pigments on these time scales. This is especially true for E122Q rods where the bleached native rods that have been regenerated with 9-cis retinal have a smaller spectral shift (\u03bb<sub>max</sub> shift) compared to the WT rods."

Although it provides a single data point for this theory, it is important because the theory is more challenging to test for rods (for which spontaneous isomerization is arguably of much greater biological significance than for cones) than for cones because of the limited range of \u03bb<sub>max</sub> values found in naturally occurring rod pigments. In addition, the frequency is so low for rods that it can only be measured in intact rods, making use of their ability to use extremely efficient amplification mechanisms to allow measurement of single-molecule isomerization events. Making use of an existing mouse model with a knock-in of a rod pigment with a single point mutation that results in a significant blue shift, the authors have quantitatively confirmed that the spontaneous rate is predicted by the theory. Secondarily, they verify that the binding pocket for the chromophore is very similar to that in WT rhodopsin, based on its extremely slow chromophore exchange kinetics."

The primary experimental system is a knockin/knockout mouse (Rho<sup>E122Q/E122Q</sup>, Gcaps<sup>-/-</sup>) in which the usual wild-type rhodopsin (Rho) is replaced by the mutant Rho E122Q, which has been characterized in some detail earlier using a variety of methods.

The confusion for 30 years is whether the spontaneous activity of a pigment comes from thermal isomerization or from some other irrelevant chemical reaction.

The new data on live zebrafish cones and rods (with the long time required for acquiring these data explaining the delay in submitting the revised manuscript) suggest that, as in the case of salamander red cone pigment previously studied by us (Kefalov et al., Neuron, 2005), there is a clear difference between native rhodopsin and cone pigments with respect to dark chromophore-exchange \u2013 namely, either no observable exchange up to 6 hours for rod pigment or &gt;50% exchange already in 2 hr or less for cone pigments. Thus, we have taken the simple approach of referring to these pigments as having \u201cclosed\u201d and \u201copen\u201d chromophore-binding pocket, respectively. Should we later find that the openness/closedness of the chromophore-binding pocket ought to be quantified in a finer fashion, we shall refine our theory accordingly.

The authors claim that within the measured times there is no spectral shifts in E122Q-rods that have been exposed to 9-cis retinal. This data is used to conclude that the exchange rate is in line with rod pigments in E122Q-rods. The conclusion is central for the paper. It would be important to validate this argument by giving an estimate of the expected spectral shifts in MSP measurements for a chromophore exchange rate that is in line with that expected for cone-pigments in a similar time interval and relate this predicted shift to the accuracy of the \u03bb<sub>max</sub> measurements. This is needed to assess to which extent the MSP with its current measurement accuracy for \u03bb<sub>max</sub> is sensitive to the chromophore exchange rates representing rod and/or cone type pigments on these time scales. This is especially true for E122Q rods where the bleached native rods that have been regenerated with 9-cis retinal have a smaller spectral shift (\u03bb<sub>max</sub> shift) compared to the WT rods.</i>"

The zebrafish data are now included in the revised manuscript. The bottom line is that, to the extent resolvable, the property of dark chromophore-exchange does appear to be common across cone pigments but negligible in rhodopsin. Regarding the chromophore-binding pocket, we now simply define it operationally as being \u201copen\u201d if the pigment shows the property of dark chromophore exchange with an exogenous chromophore without isomerization. Rhodopsin shows no sign of any exchange up to 6 hours, whereas cone pigments show substantial exchange in the order of an hour, whether in salamander (Kefalov et al., Neuron, 2005) or zebrafish (in this paper). We would like to emphasize here (and have stated as such in the paper) that our work, which uses one value for the pre-exponential factor <i>A</i> for rod pigments and another for cone pigments (i.e., a binary situation), is not necessarily intended to be the final word. If it turns out in the future that the <i>A</i> value has more than two possible values, we may have to fine-tune the theory."

Although it provides a single data point for this theory, it is important because the theory is more challenging to test for rods (for which spontaneous isomerization is arguably of much greater biological significance than for cones) than for cones because of the limited range of \u03bb<sub>max</sub> values found in naturally occurring rod pigments. In addition, the frequency is so low for rods that it can only be measured in intact rods, making use of their ability to use extremely efficient amplification mechanisms to allow measurement of single-molecule isomerization events. Making use of an existing mouse model with a knock-in of a rod pigment with a single point mutation that results in a significant blue shift, the authors have quantitatively confirmed that the spontaneous rate is predicted by the theory. Secondarily, they verify that the binding pocket for the chromophore is very similar to that in WT rhodopsin, based on its extremely slow chromophore exchange kinetics.</i>"
