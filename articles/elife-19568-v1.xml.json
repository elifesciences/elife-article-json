                    "text": "Laetoli is a well-known palaeontological locality in northern Tanzania whose outstanding record includes the earliest hominin footprints in the world (3.66 million years old), discovered in 1978 at Site G and attributed to <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i>. Here, we report hominin tracks unearthed in the new Site S at Laetoli and referred to two bipedal individuals (S1 and S2) moving on the same palaeosurface and in the same direction as the three hominins documented at Site G. The stature estimates for S1 greatly exceed those previously reconstructed for <i>Au. afarensis</i> from both skeletal material and footprint data. In combination with a comparative reappraisal of the Site G footprints, the evidence collected here embodies very important additions to the Pliocene record of hominin behaviour and morphology. Our results are consistent with considerable body size variation and, probably, degree of sexual dimorphism within a single species of bipedal hominins as early as 3.66 million years ago."

Here, we report hominin tracks unearthed in the new Site S at Laetoli and referred to two bipedal individuals (S1 and S2) moving on the same palaeosurface and in the same direction as the three hominins documented at Site G. The stature estimates for S1 greatly exceed those previously reconstructed for <i>Au. afarensis</i> from both skeletal material and footprint data. In combination with a comparative reappraisal of the Site G footprints, the evidence collected here embodies very important additions to the Pliocene record of hominin behaviour and morphology. Our results are consistent with considerable body size variation and, probably, degree of sexual dimorphism within a single species of bipedal hominins as early as 3.66 million years ago."

Seven bipedal tracks in different preservation state (see below) were exposed in L8 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>) and four in M9 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Two additional tracks of the same individual were found in the eastern part of TP2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). All these prints are clearly referable to a single individual trackway, with an estimated total length of 32 m and trending SSE\u00a0to\u00a0NNW (i.e., 320\u2013330\u00b0), approximately parallel to the G1 and G2/3 trackways. Following the code used for the Site G prints (<a href=\"#bib29\">Leakey, 1981</a>), we refer to the new individual as S1 (footprint numbers S1-1\u20137 in L8, S1-1\u20134 in M9 and S1-1\u20132 in TP2). At the end of the September 2015 field season, we discovered one more track referable to a second individual (S2), in the SW corner of TP2. Conversely, we exposed only non-hominin footprints in test-pit M10 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Consequently, the Tuff is overlain here only by reworked loose soil, and the tracks are not filled up with compact and/or cemented sediment. Preservation issues arise from this situation, because the tuff tends to be rather altered and dislodged along the natural fractures (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The first four tracks in the L8 trail are the best preserved, whereas the state of preservation of the footprint-bearing surface is particularly critical in the northern part (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), where the\u00a0surface\u00a0appears very damaged by cracks of different size and by plant roots. Some parts of the surface even subsided into micro-grabens developed along the main faults. Consequently, the anterior portion of the track L8/S1-6 is no longer visible because it is situated in one of these lowered parts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Moreover, a zigzag channel, probably formed by a large root, crosses the northern half of this test-pit from SE to NW, so that L8/S1-5 is virtually indiscernible (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In the western portion of L8, three large rounded holes (green circles in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) originated from roots of acacia trees that grew on the surface. Raindrop imprints are visible to the northern edge of the test-pit (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) on two relatively well-preserved portions of the tuff surrounded by weathered and lowered areas. These features have\u00a0also\u00a0been described in several other footprint-bearing sites at Laetoli (<a href=\"#bib30\">Leakey, 1987a</a>)."

This enlarged morphology is possibly due to a lateral slipping of the foot before the toe-off; alternatively, it could be due to taphonomic factors\u00a0as\u00a0a thick root crossing the footprint longitudinally may have altered its original morphology. The overall morphology of the S1 tracks matches those at Site G (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>) and is similar in particular to the prints of the larger individual, G2 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Robbins, 1987</a>): the heel has an oval shape and is pressed deeply into the ground; the medial side of the arch is higher than the lateral one; the ball region is oriented at an angle of about 75\u00b0 with respect to the longitudinal axis of the foot and is delimited anteriorly by a transversal ridge, formed when the toes gripped the wet ash and pushed it posteriorly. No clear distinction among the toes is visible. The adducted hallux extends more anteriorly than the other toes in all visible footprints. In TP2/S1-1, the hallux apparently shuffled anteriorly when the foot was lifted from the ground. Some tracks (especially L8/S1-3, M9/S1-2, M9/S1-3 and TP2/S1-1) are characterised by a posterior drag mark about 100 mm long (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig9\">7</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>). These\u00a0marks\u00a0were possibly left by the heel shuffling on the ash before being firmly placed into the soil. The two latter features were also\u00a0recognised in some of the G2 prints (<a href=\"#bib50\">Robbins, 1987</a>) and suggest that the feet were probably lifted above the ground at a low oblique angle. The depth distribution pattern indicates that the weight transfer of S1 was similar to that described for G1\u20133 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Robbins, 1987</a>): starting from the heel, the weight was transferred along the lateral part of the foot (note the steep slope of the lateral wall of the tracks compared to that on the medial side) up to the distal metatarsal region, and from here to the toes. In some of the S1 tracks (L8/S1-1, L8/S1-3 and TP2/S1-8, all of the right side), however,\u00a0the area of maximum depth is located beneath toes 2\u20135. This may suggest a somewhat asymmetrical walking, in which the weight was sometimes loaded on the anterolateral part of the foot before the toe-off. Alternatively, this pattern may be indicative of a rotation of the upper body during the gait (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schmid, 2004</a>). The angle of gait ranges approximately from 2\u00b0 to 11\u00b0, without any particular difference between the right and left sides. Regarding this aspect, S1 resembles more G2/3, for which very low average angles are reported, whereas G1 shows instead wide\u00a0asymmetrical angles (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tuttle, 1987</a>)."

Site G is situated about 150 m to the north, on the same surface but 1.5\u20132 m lower than Site S. Several shallow gullies dissect this surface, producing a complexly terraced morphology: consequently, there is no observable stratigraphic continuity between the two sites. However, the gullies put into light about 2\u20133 m of the underlying sequence, whose units are horizontally layered and characterised by almost constant thickness. Only a shallow depression elongated E-W can be observed between the sites; this is probably an ancient erosion channel filled by a constant thickness of the Site S footprint-bearing tuff.

Significant implications about the social structure of this stem hominin species derive from these physical and behavioural characteristics, suggesting that reproductive strategies and social structure among at least some of the early bipedal hominins were closer to a gorilla-like model than to chimpanzees or modern humans."

The easiest method follows <a href=\"#bib58\">Tuttle (1987)</a> and consists of estimating the stature starting from the footprint length\u00a0considering the ratio between foot length and stature in modern humans. Given that the foot length in <i>H. sapiens</i> is generally about 14% to 16% of stature (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tuttle [1987]</a>, and references therein), we computed two estimates for the Laetoli hominins assuming that their feet were, respectively, 14% and 16% of their body height (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#tbl3\">3</a>). This method, however, is not fully reliable because it is based on the\u00a0body proportions of modern humans, and because it does not take into account that the footprint length does not accurately reflect the foot length. For this last reason, we also estimated\u00a0stature using the method of <a href=\"#bib11\">Dingwall et al. (2013)</a>, who published some equations based on regressions of stature by footprint length in modern Daasanach people (from\u00a0the\u00a0Lake Turkana area, Kenya). In particular, given the probable low walking speed of the Laetoli hominins (see below), we used the 'walk only' equation (Standard Error of Estimate, SEE\u00a0=\u00a05.4) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dingwall et al., 2013</a>). The obtained\u00a0results (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#tbl3\">3</a>) fall within the range of statures estimated with the first method (except for G1 and G3, for which slightly taller statures were calculated). Finally, to assess how the results were influenced by considering modern human data, we also computed some estimates using the foot:stature ratio known for <i>Au. afarensis</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dingwall et al., 2013</a>). This ratio is 0.155\u20130.162 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dingwall et al., 2013</a>), so\u00a0we obtained stature estimates (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#tbl3\">3</a>) predictably close to or slightly lower than the lower limit of the estimates given by the <a href=\"#bib58\">Tuttle (1987)</a> method."

For S2 only, we used the relationship between the footprint length and body mass (SEE\u00a0=\u00a03.8) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dingwall et al., 2013</a>) because of the enlarged morphology of TP2/S2-1.

Laetoli is already famous for its Site G fossil footprints of (presumably) <i>Australopithecus afarensis</i> individuals. The new Site S footprints reported here represent very important additions to the Pliocene record of hominin behavior and morphology. A dozen new footprints from the S1 (N=11) and S2 (N=1) trails are sufficiently complete to estimate the body sizes of their makers (again, presumably <i>A. afarensis</i>) as well as approximate walking speeds. The new stature estimate for one of the individuals greatly exceeds those previously reconstructed from fossilized skeletal material or footprint data for any <i>A. afarensis</i> individual, consistent with substantial body size variation and likely sexual dimorphism within a single species of sexually dimorphic australopithecines."
