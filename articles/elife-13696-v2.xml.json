                    "text": "Neurotransmitter release requires SNARE complexes to bring membranes together, NSF-SNAPs to recycle the SNAREs, Munc18-1 and Munc13s to orchestrate SNARE complex assembly, and Synaptotagmin-1 to trigger fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane fusion. However, it is unclear whether Munc13s function upstream and/or downstream of SNARE complex assembly, and how the actions of their multiple domains are integrated. Reconstitution, liposome-clustering and electrophysiological experiments now reveal a functional synergy between the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and C<sub>2</sub>C domains of Munc13-1, indicating that these domains help bridging the vesicle and plasma membranes to facilitate stimulation of SNARE complex assembly by the Munc13-1 MUN domain. Our reconstitution data also suggest that Munc18-1, Munc13-1, NSF, \u03b1SNAP and the SNAREs are critical to form a \u2018primed\u2019 state that does not fuse but is ready for fast fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Overall, our results support a model whereby the multiple domains of Munc13s cooperate to coordinate synaptic vesicle docking, priming and fusion."

However, it is unclear whether Munc13s function upstream and/or downstream of SNARE complex assembly, and how the actions of their multiple domains are integrated. Reconstitution, liposome-clustering and electrophysiological experiments now reveal a functional synergy between the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and C<sub>2</sub>C domains of Munc13-1, indicating that these domains help bridging the vesicle and plasma membranes to facilitate stimulation of SNARE complex assembly by the Munc13-1 MUN domain. Our reconstitution data also suggest that Munc18-1, Munc13-1, NSF, \u03b1SNAP and the SNAREs are critical to form a \u2018primed\u2019 state that does not fuse but is ready for fast fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Overall, our results support a model whereby the multiple domains of Munc13s cooperate to coordinate synaptic vesicle docking, priming and fusion."

Electrical signals in one neuron trigger the release of the neurotransmitters, which then bind to receptor proteins on another neuron nearby. Neurotransmitters are packaged into small compartments called synaptic vesicles and are released from the neuron when these vesicles fuse with the membrane that surrounds the cell. Many proteins are involved in regulating this process to ensure that neurotransmitters are released at the right place and time."

It contains many different regions, including a long domain called MUN and three additional domains called C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and C<sub>2</sub>C among others. However, it is not clear how all these domains work together to control neurotransmitter release. Here Liu, Seven et al. address this question using purified proteins inserted into membranes as well as experiments in neurons from mice. The experiments show that the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and C<sub>2</sub>C domains all play key roles in neurotransmitter release. Together with the MUN domain, these three domains help to form bridges between synaptic vesicles and the membrane surrounding the neuron. These bridges could help other proteins involved in neurotransmitter release to form a group that induces vesicle fusion."

A future challenge is to find out how the proteins that form this primed state promote vesicle fusion."

These large proteins of presynaptic active zones contain a variable N-terminal region that in some isoforms include a C<sub>2</sub> domain (the C<sub>2</sub>A domain), and a highly conserved C-terminal region that includes (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> for Munc13-1): i) a C<sub>1</sub> domain involved in diacyglycerol (DAG)-phorbol ester-dependent augmentation of release (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rhee et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Basu et al., 2007</a>); a C<sub>2</sub>B domain that regulates release probability and modifies short term plasticity through its Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phosphatidylinositolphosphate-binding activities (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shin et al., 2010</a>); a MUN domain that is key for the crucial function of Munc13 in release (<a href=\"#bib7\">Basu et al., 2005</a>) and mediates the activity of Munc13 in opening syntaxin-1 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Richmond et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ma et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yang et al., 2015</a>); and a C<sub>2</sub>C domain that is also important for release (<a href=\"#bib35\">Madison et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Stevens et al., 2005</a>) and is not predicted to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> but may bind phospholipids because this is a common property of C<sub>2</sub> domains (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rizo and Sudhof, 1998</a>). The central function of Munc13s in neurotransmitter release was initially associated to an essential role in vesicle priming (<a href=\"#bib3\">Augustin et al., 1999</a>), but later studies that used stringent definitions of vesicle docking (see discussion) uncovered a critical role for Munc13s in docking that was attributed to their activity in mediating SNARE complex assembly (<a href=\"#bib65\">Weimer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Imig et al., 2014</a>). However, it is unknown whether Munc13s participate in upstream interactions that might help bridging the two membranes to promote docking and priming. This possibility is attractive because the MUN domain is related to tethering factors involved in diverse forms of membrane traffic (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pei et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2011</a>) and is flanked by domains with demonstrated or potential lipid-binding properties. Moreover, while there is evidence that Munc13s modulate release probability and have a role beyond docking [e.g. (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rhee et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shin et al., 2010</a>)], it is unclear whether they form part of the primed complex after SNARE complex assembly, influencing membrane fusion downstream of priming."

                                "text": "As expected, Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB could not stimulate lipid mixing between V- and T-liposomes in the presence of NSF-\u03b1SNAP because NSF-\u03b1SNAP disassemble the syntaxin-1-SNAP-25\u2009t-SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ma et al., 2013</a>), but it was surprising that Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB did not have marked effects on the lipid mixing observed in the presence of Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, Munc18-1 and NSF-\u03b1SNAP (data not shown; see also below). This observation prompted us to investigate to what extent the lipid mixing observed in these experiments reflects real membrane fusion. For this purpose, we used an assay that simultaneously measures lipid mixing from de-quenching of the fluorescence of Marina Blue-labeled lipids and content mixing from the development of FRET between PhycoE-Biotin trapped in the T-liposomes and Cy5-Streptavidin trapped in the V-liposomes (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zucchi and Zick, 2011</a>). Addition of unlabeled streptavidin to the reaction ensures that the observed FRET arises only from content mixing. Using this approach, we again observed that efficient lipid mixing in the presence of NSF-\u03b1SNAP required C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and Munc18-1, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and that Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB did not markedly affect lipid mixing under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>). However, content mixing in the presence of Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, Munc18-1, NSF-\u03b1SNAP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>was inefficient in the absence of Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB and was strongly enhanced by Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D</a>). The difference between lipid and content mixing in the absence of Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB emphasizes the fact that lipid mixing may not necessarily reflect true membrane fusion, as described in previous studies [e.g. (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zick and Wickner, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kyoung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Diao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lai et al., 2014</a>)]. Overall, our results show that Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB selectively enhances content mixing but not lipid mixing under our conditions. These findings indicate that Syt1 plays a role in membrane fusion, in agreement with results from single vesicle assays using full-length Syt1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kyoung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Diao et al., 2012</a>)."

Note that in these assays much of the Cy5 fluorescence increase caused by FRET from PhycoE (reflecting content mixing) should occur during the first round of fusion and that no further substantial increases are thus expected in subsequent rounds of fusion or upon detergent addition. Correspondingly, the maximum Cy5 fluorescence observed in our most efficient fusion reactions was similar to that observed upon detergent addition (e.g. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, red curve; see Materials and Methods). In contrast, the lipid mixing signal expressed as percentage of maximum Marina Blue fluorescence is much smaller in the same reactions (e.g. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, red curve) because fluorescence de-quenching is expected to continue in successive rounds of fusion and to undergo a further, large increase upon detergent addition due to additional probe dilution."

We hypothesized that the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>C domain might be such a factor based on evidence suggesting that this domain plays an important role in release (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stevens et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Madison et al., 2005</a>). To test this hypothesis, we performed fusion assays between V- and T-liposomes, with or without Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB, in the presence of Munc18-1, NSF-\u03b1SNAP and fragments of Munc13-1 that contained the MUN domain alone or together with the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region, the C<sub>2</sub>C domain, or both (MUN, C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, MUNC<sub>2</sub>C and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, respectively).

Since these two domains bind DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub>, respectively, we tested the effects of removing DAG, PIP<sub>2</sub> or both in the T-liposomes in the full reconstitutions including C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C and observed considerable impairments of fusion (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), similar to those observed in the lipid mixing assays of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>. We also attempted to examine the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of fusion in these full reconstitutions, which were normally performed with 100\u2009\u03bcM EGTA to chelate any residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> before addition of 600\u2009\u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (to make the concentration of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> 500\u2009\u03bcM). However, experiments where we added 100 or 120\u2009\u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 300\u2009s (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) yielded similar fusion efficiency to that observed when we added 600\u2009\u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Since the EGTA present should chelate most of the added 100\u2009\u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, these results suggest that a small amount of residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> (likely in the 1\u2009\u03bcM range or below) is sufficient to trigger fusion in these experiments, but further research will be required to assess the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence more accurately. Note that the sensitivity of the reaction to such low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, compared to those that activate Syt1 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fernandez-Chacon et al., 2001</a>), can be attributed to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain present in C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shin et al., 2010</a>) (see below), and that residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> might arise from the purified C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment, which we did not treat with Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators to avoid removal of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions bound to the C<sub>1</sub> domain."

Although these measurements reflect not only liposome clustering but also fusion, clustering should dominate the formation of large particles. These data indicated that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C is somewhat more efficient in liposome clustering than C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, exhibiting substantial clustering activity at 50\u2013100 nM concentration (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Since C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C clustered mixtures of T- and V-liposomes more efficiently than C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), these data suggested that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C may preferentially bridge V-liposomes to T-liposomes. To test this notion more rigorously, we analyzed liposome clustering after 3 min at 20\u00b0C to minimize contributions of liposome fusion to the DLS data. Lipid mixing assays confirmed that very little fusion occurs under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). At 20\u00b0C, C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C again was able to cluster T-liposomes but not V-liposomes in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which required Ca<sup>2+</sup> for clustering (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6A\u2013D</a>). To test whether populations of clustered and non-clustered liposomes can be distinguished by DLS, we used plain vesicles that did not contain PS or proteins and that, correspondingly, were not clustered by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Indeed, a clearly bimodal distribution of clustered and non-clustered liposomes was observed by DLS when we added C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C to a 1:1 mixture of plain liposomes and T-liposomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Importantly, only clustered vesicles were detectable by DLS analysis of a 1:1 mixture of V- and T-liposomes in the presence of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C and the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a>). These data show that, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C does not cluster V-liposomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), it can bridge V-liposomes to T-liposomes."

However, it is important to note that there are multiple potential explanations for these activities. The findings that PS is a major determinant of vesicle clustering by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) without requiring Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure\u00a02\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), but C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> to cluster V-liposomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), suggest that there are multiple membrane binding sites in these large protein fragments that can cooperate in cis to interact with a single membrane or in trans to bind to two membranes. Indeed, the MUN, C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains contain several positive patches, the C<sub>1</sub> domain binds to DAG, and the C<sub>2</sub>B domain binds to PIP<sub>2</sub> weakly in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and more strongly in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yang et al., 2015</a>). The C<sub>2</sub>C domain is likely to have at least one lipid-binding site with moderate affinity that explains the stronger overall liposome clustering activity of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C compared to C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (see discussion). Moreover, the sequence spanning residues 1517\u20131531 at the C-terminus of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN does not form part of the MUN domain structure (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yang et al. 2015</a>) and contains a highly hydrophobic sequence that could bind to membranes, but this sequence may become structured due to the presence of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain in C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, which could render it unable to bind membranes. We speculate that this hydrophobic sequence together with positive patches in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region underlie the liposome clustering activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<b>A</b>), while in C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C the C<sub>2</sub>C domain provides a PS-binding site that cooperates with the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region to favor binding in cis to the same membrane (<b>B</b>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain may favor membrane binding of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C in a different orientation that facilitates interaction of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain in trans with another membrane, which would explain why Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C can bridge V-liposomes; this orientation could also be favored by binding of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to PIP<sub>2</sub> and of the C<sub>1</sub> domain to DAG in T-liposomes (<b>C</b>), leading to the overall notion that the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region binds to the plasma membrane and the C<sub>2</sub>C domain to synaptic vesicle membrane (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Extensive studies will be required to test this and other plausible models compatible with the liposome clustering data."

We thus performed additional lipid and content mixing assays with all protein and liposome concentrations diluted 2-fold, 4-fold and 8-fold, and found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> still stimulated fusion strongly even in the most diluted conditions, albeit at a somewhat slower rate (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>). Analysis of the fusion reaction with the 8-fold dilution by DLS revealed that efficient clustering already occurred after 3 min in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and the particle size increased to a very little extent one minute after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4C\u2013F</a>), although the size did increase considerably as the reaction progressed to completion. These results suggest that the action of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C in these experiments is not limited to bridging V- to T-liposomes but also involves activities downstream of such bridging."

To study how membrane-anchoring of Syt1 affects fusion in our assays, we used liposomes containing synaptobrevin and a Syt1 fragment spanning its transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic regions (VSyt1-liposomes). These liposomes contained a smaller percentage of PS (6.8%) that resembles that of synaptic vesicles and prevents inhibition of fusion due to binding of Syt1 to the membrane where it is anchored (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stein et al., 2007</a>). The VSyt1-liposomes fused efficiently with T-liposomes in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stein et al., 2007</a>), and the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN fragment slightly increased the fusion efficiency, but Munc18-1 had no marked effect (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). However, as expected, fusion was abolished by NSF-\u03b1SNAP and, in their presence, fusion required Munc18-1, C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>). These latter results are similar to those obtained in the experiments where the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB was added instead of incorporating Syt1 into the V-liposomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>)."

To test this idea, we analyzed fusion between VSyt1- and T-liposomes in the presence of NSF-\u03b1SNAP, Munc18-1 and a mutant Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment where two of the aspartate Ca<sup>2+</sup> ligands were mutated to asparagine (D705N,D711N) to disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. We found that content mixing was strongly impaired by the D706N,D711N mutation while Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent lipid mixing was not affected (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E,F</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain is critical for fusion under these conditions. To examine how these results are related to the membrane bridging activity of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, we analyzed the particle size in fusion reactions where all protein and liposome concentrations were diluted eight-fold, which still allows a strong Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced stimulation of content mixing for WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (as observed in the experiments performed with the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment; <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>) but not for the D706N,D711N mutant (<a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013D</a>). DLS analysis of the 8-fold diluted fusion reactions including WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C showed that much of the liposome clustering had already occurred after 3 min in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, while little changes were observed 1 min after adding Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a moderate increase in particle size occurred as the reaction progressed to completion (<a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>). In analogous reactions with the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C D706N,D711N mutant, efficient clustering occurred after 3 min and did not increase further afterwards (<a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>)."

Note also that the finding that the D706N,D711N mutation disrupts content mixing but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent lipid mixing (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>) correlates with the observation that efficient content mixing in the presence of WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>, while there is substantial lipid mixing without Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figures 9A,C,E</a>). Indeed, quantification at 300\u2009s, before Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition, showed that the fluorescence increase reflecting lipid mixing was 28.9% of that observed 200\u2009s after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition while content mixing was minimal at 300\u2009s (fluorescence 3.3% of that observed 200\u2009s after adding Ca<sup>2+</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This difference is exacerbated by the fact that the maximal fluorescence associated with content mixing is expected to correspond to only one round of fusion, whereas additional rounds of fusion can contribute to the maximal fluorescence in the lipid mixing signal. Hence, these results suggest that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C, NSF-\u03b1SNAP and Munc18-1 enable formation of a \u2018primed state\u2019 that is ready for membrane fusion and includes assembled trans-SNARE complexes, as lipid mixing can occur, but requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0binding to the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain for fast full fusion that might be further accelerated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to Syt1."

To clarify the functional importance of different domains for Munc13-1, we performed additional rescue experiments in autaptic neuronal cultures from Munc13-1/2 double KO mice (<a href=\"#bib61\">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</a>) but expressing Munc13-1 fragments with a lentiviral expression vector, which does not overexpress proteins at such high levels as the Semliki Forest virus. Analysis of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) revealed that a Munc13-1 fragment encompassing the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C region rescued close to 50% of the EPSC amplitude compared to rescue with WT Munc13-1, whereas Munc13-1 fragments spanning the MUN, MUNC<sub>2</sub>C or C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN sequences led to only very small levels of rescue (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>). Similar results were obtained when we analyzed the readily-releasable pool using hypertonic sucrose (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C,D</a>). These results need to be examined with caution because distinct expression levels were observed for the different fragments (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, all Munc13-1 fragments were expressed at higher levels than WT, and hence their levels should be sufficient to rescue release if the fragments are functional. Indeed, since there is no release in Munc13-1/2 double KO neurons (<a href=\"#bib61\">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</a>), the very small amounts of release observed for the rescues with MUN, MUNC<sub>2</sub>C and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN fragments imply that these fragments can perform Munc13-1 function to some degree, albeit with very low efficiency, and vast protein production may have compensated for functional deficiency in the previous rescues with Semliki Forest virus overexpression of the MUN domain (<a href=\"#bib7\">Basu et al., 2005</a>). Importantly, the robust rescue observed with the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment compared to C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>) shows that the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>C domain indeed plays an important role in neurotransmitter release, in clear correlation with our reconstitution data. Moreover, the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region is also critical for Munc13-1 function, as the MUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment is much less active than C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C in both the rescue experiments (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>) and in our fusion assays (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">9</a>)."

Strong evidence indicates that Munc18-1 and Munc13s orchestrate SNARE complex formation in an NSF-SNAP-resistant manner (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ma et al., 2013</a>), and that the participation of Munc13s in SNARE complex formation underlies their key functions in vesicle docking and priming (<a href=\"#bib65\">Weimer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Imig et al., 2014</a>). However, it was unclear whether Munc13s have additional roles upstream and/or downstream of SNARE complex assembly. Moreover, it was unknown how the functions of the different domains that form the highly conserved C-terminal region of Munc13s are integrated. Our results now show that both the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B-region preceding the MUN domain and the C<sub>2</sub>C domain at the C-terminus are critical for neurotransmitter release, and suggest a strong functional synergy between these domains that arises because they help bridging the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes, facilitating the activity of the MUN domain in mediating opening of syntaxin-1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Our results also indicate that the neuronal SNAREs, Munc18-1, Munc13, NSF and \u03b1-SNAP are crucial to generate a \u2018primed state\u2019 that includes Munc13 as an integral component and is ready to release but needs Ca<sup>2+</sup> to trigger fast membrane fusion."

The finding that the Mun13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment can bridge V-liposomes to T-liposomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) is particularly revealing because it suggests a natural model for how the different domains that form the conserved C-terminal region of Munc13s cooperate to mediate synaptic vesicle docking and priming (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), providing an explanation for why this fragment rescues neurotransmitter release and stimulates liposome fusion much more efficiently than shorter fragments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig9\">9</a> and <a href=\"#fig10\">10</a>). In this model, we assume that NSF-\u03b1SNAP disassemble the syntaxin-1-SNAP-25 complex in the T-liposomes and Munc18-1 binds to the released syntaxin-1 folded into a closed conformation. Bridging of the two membranes through respective interactions with the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region and the C<sub>2</sub>C domain at opposite ends of the highly elongated MUN domain creates a \u2018cage-like\u2019 environment to facilitate SNARE complex assembly, placing the MUN domain in an ideal position to exert its activity in accelerating the transition from the syntaxin-1-Munc18-1 complex to the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This model is consistent with studies that revealed an important function for Munc13s in docking using stringent vesicle-plasma membrane distance criteria [direct contact or &lt;5 nm; (<a href=\"#bib65\">Weimer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Imig et al., 2014</a>)], and that suggested that docking is equivalent to priming, reflecting partial SNARE complex formation (note that this notion may not be valid for more relaxed definitions of docking). Our model postulates that Munc13s function in docking and priming not only because they promote SNARE complex assembly but also because they participate in upstream interactions that provide a bridge between the two membranes."

Indeed, these tethering factors likely facilitate SNARE complex formation by similar mechanisms to that proposed here for Munc13-1 (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yu and Hughson, 2010</a>). The presence of C<sub>1</sub> domain and C<sub>2</sub> domains adjacent to the MUN domain in Munc13s provides opportunities for modulation by factors that regulate release such as DAG, PIP<sub>2</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, Munc13-1 contains an N-terminal C<sub>2</sub>A domain that contributes to vesicle docking via interaction with \u03b1RIMs [(<a href=\"#bib17\">Dulubova et al., 2005</a>); M. Camacho and C. Rosenmund, unpublished results], which underlies the finding that rescue of release by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C is incomplete (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>) and further supports the notion of an overall role for Munc13s in docking. We also note that reconstitution studies had previously shown that Munc13-4 promotes docking of V- to T-membranes in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boswell et al., 2012</a>), but it is unclear to what extent this activity is related to that describe here for Munc13-1 because the C-terminal C<sub>2</sub> domain of Munc13-4 binds Ca<sup>2+</sup>, whereas the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C is not predicted to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rizo and Sudhof, 1998</a>)."

The interactions that cause such bridging are still unclear and extensive studies will be required to characterize them because the distinct vesicle clustering properties of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) suggest that these large protein fragments contain multiple membrane binding sites that can cooperate in cis to interact with a single membrane or in trans to bind to two membranes (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We have been unable to express the C<sub>2</sub>C domain alone and we have not detected specific interactions of this domain with the SNAREs in preliminary NMR experiments using the MUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment. Although this fragment does not bind tightly to liposomes (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), it seems likely that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain contains a lipid-binding site(s) with moderate affinity, as this feature would explain the stronger overall liposome clustering activity of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C compared to C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and phospholipid binding is a characteristic property of C<sub>2</sub> domains (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rizo and Sudhof, 1998</a>).

This proposal is consistent with data suggesting a role for Sec1p (the yeast Munc18-1) after SNARE complex assembly (<a href=\"#bib21\">Grote et al., 2000</a>) and with the observation that a constitutively open syntaxin-1 mutant fully rescues the docking defect observed in <i>Unc13</i> nulls in C. elegans but rescues neurotransmitter release only partially, which also suggested a role for Unc13 downstream of SNARE complex formation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hammarlund et al., 2007</a>). It is also possible that \u03b1-SNAP forms part of this primed complex (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zick et al., 2015</a>).

Thus, effects of Syt1 may only be observable at faster time scales, as Syt1 is not essential for release but is key to trigger release with high speed upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sudhof, 2013</a>).

Note also that the strong effect of the D705N,D711N mutation in the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain in our reconstitutions (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E,F</a>) contrasts with the mild effects of an analogous mutation in the C<sub>2</sub>B domain of the related isoform Munc13-2 on evoked release (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shin et al., 2010</a>). However, it is plausible that these mild effects arise because this isoform has some functional differences with Munc13-1 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rosenmund et al., 2002</a>) or because there is some functional redundancy with another protein not included in our reconstitutions (e.g. CAPS), and the increased release probability caused by the mutation in the Munc13-2 C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shin et al., 2010</a>) suggests a role as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that might cooperate with Syt1. Mutating the Munc13-2 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites did have marked effects on release during action-potential trains; hence, our reconstitution results, which were obtained in the presence of DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub>, may be related to hyper-activated states present during these trains."

To measure content mixing without interference from vesicle leakiness, most experiments were performed in the presence of 5\u2009\u03bcM streptavidin. Control experiments without streptavidin were performed to measure the maximum Cy5 fluorescence attainable upon detergent addition. However, there was a large variability in the maximum Cy5 fluorescence values observed, perhaps because of binding of the dye to the detergent. Since the average maximum values observed in detergent were similar to the maximum Cy5 fluorescence observed at the end of the most efficient fusion reactions (those including the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment, e.g. <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, blue trace) and the latter was more reproducible, in practice we used averaged maximum values of these reactions for normalization.

While the experiments presented in this work expand on previous work on the role of Munc13 on synaptic vesicle priming and plasticity, the suggested role as acting in \"synergy\" with the synaptotagmin C<sub>2</sub> domains is less clear and, ideally, should be further tested by additional experiments as outlined below (points 1, 2, and 3).

The experiments of Shin et al. revealed no effect of the DN mutant on isolated EPSCs, and on the RRP.

Since in their bulk assay, t- and v-vesicles may continuously undergo docking, this produces opportunities for both lipid and content mixing to occur as a consequence of an increasing number of docked vesicles.

The authors suggest that different mechanisms are at play, but there may be other possibilities. The calcium independent lipid mixing effects of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN are thought to reflect support of SNARE complex assembly by C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN. In the presence of NSF/SNAP and Munc18-1 there are at least two explanations: (1) NSF/SNAP reverts the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN-mediated SNARE complex assembly in the absence of calcium, while in the presence of calcium more C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN is recruited to the liposomes and can then override the antagonistic effect of NSF/SNAP.

Establishing this limit with some precision would help ascertain how the activity of this system compares to the resting state in the synapse. The authors also speculate that Syt1-dependence may become apparent if they had faster time resolution in their assay. Given the central role of this calcium-sensor in synaptic biology, establishing whether it has any activity here is essential. However, as pointed out in (5) above, the results with the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB domain are rather different from the results with full-length Syt1.

In particular, they make the important point that lipid-mixing proceeds \"efficiently\" without Syt1, while contents-mixing is strongly enhanced by Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB. However, in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, it is not obvious that the effect of Syt1 is more pronounced for content vs lipid-mixing. Although the change in the curves for content-mixing appear more dramatic than for lipid-mixing, this seems to be due to the scale of the axes and not necessarily to the rates. The initial rate changes about 3 fold for contents mixing (comparing B and D). A similar increase in lipid mixing would be hard to see at their resolution, but looks plausible when comparing A and C. A similar burst in lipid-mixing appears to be present in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>. Without meaningful resolution over this range, it is challenging to draw the conclusion \"the finding that Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB selectively enhances content mixing but not lipid mixing provides strong evidence that Syt1 plays a direct role in membrane fusion\u2026\". The same point is echoed strongly in the Discussion. At a minimum, it would be helpful if the authors provided initial rates from each experiment, rather than endpoints. Otherwise, the discussion surrounding whether Syt1 is uniquely designed to support full-fusion should probably be more guarded. However, all these results were generated with the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB, so again, it might be better to eliminate all results with the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB domain from this work."

The data provided in these papers are quite compelling. The three papers should be cited separately, including the corresponding conclusions, and then explain why the authors think that these papers are not helpful or believable in defining (part of) the mechanism by which Munc13 mediates vesicle docking. Somewhat in the same context, can one use the liposome-clustering activity of proteins and protein fragments as a basis to extrapolate towards corresponding roles of the respective proteins in synaptic vesicle docking in neurons? For example, in the case of Syt1, such a conclusion can probably not be drawn \u2013 loss of Syt1 does not really affect synaptic vesicle docking much."

So, 100% content mixing could actually correspond to substantially fewer vesicles undergoing content mixing than vesicles undergoing lipid mixing. A suggestion would be to change all figure panel titles from \"lipid mixing\" to \"relative lipid mixing\" and \"content mixing\" to \"relative content mixing\", and to change all the y-axis labels from \"Fluorescence (% of max)\" to \"Fluorescence (arbitrary units)\".

The results suggest that the Munc13 C2 domains (especially C2B and C2C) play key roles in priming as demonstrated by <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> (reconstitution experiments) and 10 (neuronal culture experiments). It is also suggested that the Munc13 C2 domains act synergistically together with those of synaptotagmin upon Ca2+-triggering. The study extends a previous one by the authors (Ma et al., 2013) in fundamental ways. Since fusion reactions were monitored in bulk, the effects on fusion efficiency cannot be separated from effects on vesicle docking, posing questions on the proposed role on intrinsic fusion mechanisms (points 2, 3, 6 and 9). Moreover, the absence of complexin is a limitation in their reconstituted experiments and may have influenced the effect of Munc13 in their in vitro experiments. While the experiments presented in this work expand on previous work on the role of Munc13 on synaptic vesicle priming and plasticity, the suggested role as acting in \"synergy\" with the synaptotagmin C2 domains is less clear and, ideally, should be further tested by additional experiments as outlined below (points 1, 2, and 3). The role of Munc13 in fusion per se is interesting, but the available data are still a bit too inconclusive to make such a strong statement \u2013 even in the title. For example, the DD/NN mutation in C2B impairs liposome fusion, but corresponding mutations do not affect evoked EPSCs. It might be prudent to discuss these data a bit more carefully.</i> "

Arguments commonly used to reach such conclusion include: i) there are clear correlations between the reconstitution data and physiological results; and ii) the biochemical properties underlying the reconstitution results make overall sense in the context of what is known about this system from research by a variety of approaches. Thus, many of the papers in the field that used reconstitutions have provided important insights even though they had striking contradictions with physiological data, most notably the fact that lipid and/or content mixing did not require Munc18-1 and Munc13s. Our reconstitutions are the only ones so far that can account for the dramatic disruption of release observed in the absence of Munc18-1 or Munc13s in vivo (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a> is particularly striking in this regard), they include the (arguably) eight most central components of the release machinery, and there are many correlations between the results obtained with these reconstitutions and physiological data (see Discussion)."

Similarly, if some of our reconstitution data appear to contradict physiological results (e.g. the effects of the DD/NN mutation in the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain), it is probable that there is an explanation due to functional redundancy or compensatory effects in vivo.

We are reluctant to remove the results obtained with the soluble Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment because these results are important for how the story is developed (e.g. the switch to a different method of monitoring lipid and content mixing) and because, based on the abundant data already available in the literature with this fragment, it is natural that many researchers in the field would wonder what happens if we add this fragment. Note that experiments using full-length Syt1 do have the advantage of being more physiological, as pointed out in the review, but do not allow a direct comparison of the results with and without the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub> domains with the same liposome preparations. For instance, there is a clear increase in content mixing when Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB is added in reconstitutions with C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), but it would be more difficult to reach this conclusion comparing results obtained with different V-liposome preparations that include or lack full-length Syt1. This result is important because it shows an effect of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub> domains in this system and it is likely that this effect cannot be observed when we use C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C because the system is too efficient (see Discussion). Finally, we would like to emphasize that, while it is true that some results obtained with C<sub>2</sub>AB and full-length Syt1 are different (mostly in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Munc18-1 and NSF-\u03b1SNAP) the data obtained in the presence of Munc18-1, NSF-\u03b1SNAP and different Munc13-1 fragments are quite similar for C<sub>2</sub>AB and full-length Syt1 (compare <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a> with <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>)."

We also would like to emphasize that this difference is exacerbated by the fact that the maximal fluorescence associated with content mixing is expected to correspond to only one round of fusion, whereas additional rounds of fusion could contribute to the maximal fluorescence in the lipid mixing signal, which could easily correspond to more than 0.5 rounds of fusion if lipid mixing indeed arose from real fusion (which we do not believe). Hence, there is a dramatic difference in the amounts of lipid mixing and content mixing that occur before Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition. Note also that the clear contrast between lipid and content mixing was also observed in the experiments without Syt1 or with Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB, in the presence of Munc18-1, NSF-\u03b1SNAP and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, blue curves).

In any case, it is good that the authors confirmed the content mixing results with the different content mixing assay by Zucchi and Zick. Thus, there is really no \"problem\" with the sulforhodamine content mixing assay.</i>"

We attempted to perform experiments where both liposome populations are loaded with sulforhodamine B to assess how much of the de-quenching arises from leakiness (Yu et al., 2013). However, we were unable to observe lipid mixing in these control experiments. Since the solutions of high sulforhodamine B concentrations trapped in the liposomes are highly acidic (pH about 2), which may underlie the lack of lipid mixing, we attempted to increase the pH of these solutions to 5.5 or 7.4 before trapping them into the liposomes, but at both pH values the liposomes were strongly leaky.\"</i>"

In the second revision we did not remove the data obtained with the sulforhodamine method because the argument made in the second round of review (stating that there is no problem) was not compelling; we did have a big problem with the method when we included sulforhodamine on both vesicles. With regard to the concerns raised in this third round of review, it is unclear whether the buffer can handle the strongly acidic pH caused by the very high concentrations of sulforhodamine that are being used.
