We studied the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia using a simple frequency-discrimination task. Though participants were asked to compare the two tones in each trial, implicit memory of previous trials affected their responses. We hypothesized that implicit memory decays faster among dyslexics. We tested this by increasing the temporal intervals between consecutive trials, and by measuring the behavioral impact and ERP responses from the auditory cortex. Dyslexics showed a faster decay of implicit memory effects on both measures, with similar time constants. Finally, faster decay of implicit memory also characterized the impact of sound regularities in benefitting dyslexics' oral reading rate. Their benefit decreased faster as a function of the time interval from the previous reading of the same non-word. We propose that dyslexics\u2019 shorter neural adaptation paradoxically accounts for their longer reading times, since it reduces their temporal window of integration of past stimuli, resulting in noisier and less reliable predictions for both simple and complex stimuli. Less reliable predictions limit their acquisition of reading expertise."

We studied the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia using a simple frequency-discrimination task. Though participants were asked to compare the two tones in each trial, implicit memory of previous trials affected their responses. We hypothesized that implicit memory decays faster among dyslexics. We tested this by increasing the temporal intervals between consecutive trials, and by measuring the behavioral impact and ERP responses from the auditory cortex. Dyslexics showed a faster decay of implicit memory effects on both measures, with similar time constants. Finally, faster decay of implicit memory also characterized the impact of sound regularities in benefitting dyslexics' oral reading rate. Their benefit decreased faster as a function of the time interval from the previous reading of the same non-word. We propose that dyslexics\u2019 shorter neural adaptation paradoxically accounts for their longer reading times, since it reduces their temporal window of integration of past stimuli, resulting in noisier and less reliable predictions for both simple and complex stimuli. Less reliable predictions limit their acquisition of reading expertise."

The inferred mean of previous stimuli (prior) is combined with the representation of the current stimulus, and forms an integrated percept (posterior).

One putative conceptual link may be provided by the Bayesian framework, when the principle of efficient coding is introduced (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wei et al., 2015</a>). This principle predicts that more likely stimuli gradually acquire denser, more reliable representations. The typical gradual enhancement of the representation of more likely stimuli may be reduced in dyslexia, leading to reduced sensitivity to the specific phonological and morphological forms that characterize native language. Assessing this hypothesis experimentally requires long-term tracking of the learning of novel sound statistics."

Recruitment was based on ads at the Hebrew University. Monetary compensation for participation was according to standard student rates. The study was approved by the Hebrew University Committee for the Use of Human Subjects in Research. All dyslexic participants had been diagnosed as having a specific reading disability by authorized clinicians. Reading-related measures were also assessed in our lab (detailed in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Participants with more than 2 years of formal musical education were excluded, so that musical training would not be a major contributor to their pitch sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Micheyl et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Parbery-Clark et al., 2011</a>).

Offline analysis was performed using Brain Vision Analyzer 1.05 software (Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) and EEGLAB toolbox for Matlab (<a href=\"#bib13\">Delorme and Makeig, 2004</a>). The EEG signal was digitally band-pass filtered between 1 Hz and 30 Hz to remove large drifts in signal and high-frequency noise. ICA analysis was trained on the entire length of each block and on all scalp electrodes to identify components that reflect eye-blink- or eye-movement-evoked electrical activity. An eye-related component was identified by its time-correlation with the occurrence of blinks or saccades. This relationship between the identified component and eye-blink activity was verified by confirming that the component's scalp distribution was typical of eye-related electrical activity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Delorme et al., 2007</a>). Data were referenced to the nose channel to remove external electrical influence. Artifact rejection was applied to the non-segmented data according to the following criteria: any data point with an EOG or EEG &gt;\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0100\u00a0\u00b5V was rejected along with the data\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0300 ms around it.

Finally, if the difference between two adjacent data points was more than 50\u00a0\u00b5V, the data\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0300 ms around it were rejected.

By manipulating the temporal interval between tones in a sequence while carrying out behavioral measurements and analyses of event related potentials, they demonstrated that the dyslexic participants showed less of the 'anchoring effect' attributable to the previous trials, implying that implicit memory decays faster relative to controls. A third study demonstrated a diminished benefit of re-presentation of nonword stimuli for the dyslexic participants. The authors describe the effects as 'shorter neural adaptation' and hypothesize that they reflect a 'noisier' neural environment, which can result in the cumulative difficulties that lead to reading disability."
