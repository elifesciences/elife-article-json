However, it remains unknown how serotonergic neurons that innervate the first olfactory relay respond to odor stimulation and how they integrate synaptically into local circuits. We examined the sole pair of serotonergic neurons that innervates the <i>Drosophila</i> antennal lobe (the first olfactory relay) to characterize their physiology, connectivity, and contribution to pheromone processing. We report that nearly all odors inhibit these cells, likely through connections made reciprocally within the antennal lobe. Pharmacological and immunohistochemical analyses reveal that these neurons likely release acetylcholine in addition to serotonin and that exogenous and endogenous serotonin have opposing effects on olfactory responses. Finally, we show that activation of the entire serotonergic network, as opposed to only activation of those fibers innervating the antennal lobe, may be required for persistent serotonergic modulation of pheromone responses in the antennal lobe."

Behaviors that rely critically on olfaction also depend on proper serotonin signaling (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lent et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kravitz, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dierick and Greenspan, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Becnel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Johnson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ganesh et al., 2010</a>). Recently, there has been great interest in how this transmitter influences olfactory processing across model organisms including vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib48\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Petzold et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kapoor et al., 2016</a>) and invertebrates (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kloppenburg and Mercer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gatellier et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dacks et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2009</a>). To understand how serotonin affects olfactory processing, we must understand both how the modulator is released in relation to olfactory signals, and determine the cellular effect of the modulator on each neuron in the circuit. While progress has been made towards these goals, it still remains unclear how endogenous serotonin is released into olfactory circuits and how it shapes odor responses."

Knowing how serotonin release correlates with olfactory sampling is critical for forming physiological models of 5-HT function in olfaction. For example, in mammals serotonin indirectly inhibits olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the olfactory bulb (OB) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Petzold et al., 2009</a>). Serotonin may thus serve as a gain control mechanism in the bulb if it is released during olfactory sampling, or it may actually boost olfactory responses should olfactory stimuli inhibit serotonergic fibers within the bulb(<a href=\"#bib17\">Dugu\u00e9 and Mainen, 2009</a>)."

More importantly, as with several other insect species, only one pair of serotonergic interneurons termed the contralaterally-projecting serotonin-immunoreactive deuterocerebral interneurons (CSDns), project to the first olfactory relay, the antennal lobes (AL) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kent et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sun et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dacks et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In flies, mechanisms exist to label and manipulate this neuron (<a href=\"#bib66\">Singh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Roy et al., 2007</a>), and recent studies have shown the CSDns to be directly involved in pheromone-mediated behaviors such as courtship (<a href=\"#bib66\">Singh et al., 2013</a>). Here, we sought to (1) describe for the first time the olfactory receptive fields of a serotonergic neuron that innervates a primary olfactory structure, (2) characterize the synaptic integration of this neuron within the antennal lobe, and (3) determine how the endogenous release of serotonin influences olfactory and pheromone processing in insects. Our results demonstrate that these neurons, the CSDns, are predominantly inhibited by olfactory stimulation, and that this inhibition arises from reciprocal synapses formed directly within the AL. We show that the CSDn likely also releases the fast-acting neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh), and that these two molecules produce different effects with opposing polarities and time courses on their downstream targets. Finally, we report that despite the CSDns being the only serotonergic neurons to project to the AL, robust modulation of glomeruli that respond to the male pheromone, 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), is only observed when the entire serotonergic network is stimulated in unison, rather than sole activation of the CSDns."

Several odorants, such as ammonia and ethyl acetate, indeed elicited rapid and diverse responses in these cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). However, a broad panel of odorants spanning several chemical classes reveals that most olfactory stimuli actually suppress firing in the CSDn (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This odor panel was selected such that most known ORNs classes were activated by at least one odor in the panel (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Silbering et al., 2011</a>).

If the CSDn is sensitive to this same source of inhibition, then the strongest odors in our panel should elicit the strongest inhibitory responses in these cells. Here, we define the strength of an odor to be the total olfactory receptor neuron activity as measured by a local field potential (LFP) from the antennae (<a href=\"#bib63\">Schneider, 1957</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). We measured such field potentials for a subset of our odor panel and found a strong correlation between antennal LFP amplitudes and the strength of inhibition onto the CSDn (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). These results support the notion that inhibitory responses in the CSDn may arise from the well-described inhibitory circuits of the antennal lobe."

Odor evoked inhibition of the CSDn is likely meditated in part by both transmitter systems, as bath application of their respective antagonists block this inhibition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>). While GABA and glutamate antagonists block the odor-evoked inhibition of the CSDn, it is not certain if this inhibition arises at the level of the AL. Alternatively, downstream circuits, such as the mushroom bodies or lateral horn, may project to the CSDn to provide this inhibition. Thus, we tested for pre- and postsynaptic specializations in the CSDns' neurites within the AL. We expressed a serotonin reuptake transporter fused to eGFP (dSerT-eGFP) in the CSDns (<a href=\"#bib56\">Park et al., 2006</a>). This molecule localized in the AL confirming that the CSDns release 5-HT within this structure. To determine if the CSDns also have postsynaptic sites in the AL, we expressed the dendritic marker, DenMark (<a href=\"#bib52\">Nicolai et al., 2010</a>). The positive labeling observed for both molecules suggests that the CSDn forms reciprocal connections within the antennal lobe (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E and F</a>). Specifically, we found labeling for both markers throughout the AL suggesting that all glomeruli interact with the CSDn in a bidirectional manner to some extent. Notably, the anterior lateral glomeruli, including DA1 and VA1d, which both process pheromones, had the least staining for both markers."

                                "text": "The significance of the olfactory-mediated inhibition of the CSDn will ultimately depend on its output connectivity and impact on neurons within the AL. Our immunohistochemistry and previous EM studies (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sun et al., 1993</a>) imply that the CSDn has presynaptic release sites within the AL. Additionally, serotonin has been shown to modulate GABAergic interneurons in the ALs of moths (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kloppenburg and Hildebrand, 1995</a>) and flies (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dacks et al., 2009</a>) suggesting possible synaptic connections between these cell types. To test for connections between the CSDn and GABAergic local interneurons (LNs) in the AL, we used the R60F02-Gal promoter line to express the red-light activated channelrhodopsin, Chrimson (<a href=\"#bib36\">Klapoetke, 2014</a>) in the CSDn. This line strongly labels the CSDns with only a few additional processes seen in the subesophageal ganglion (<a href=\"#bib66\">Singh et al., 2013</a>). We recorded the responses of randomly sampled LNs in the dorsal lateral cluster while stimulating the CSDn with a brief pulse of light (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Stimulation of the CSDn results in a brief depolarization of the LNs followed by a delayed hyperpolarization.(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Surprisingly, the potent 5-HT receptor antagonist, methysergide, is not effective at blocking this excitatory synapse (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). This result suggests that the CSDn may release another neurotransmitter in addition to serotonin."

We applied the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine and found that it blocks the CSDn-mediated depolarization in the LNs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The delayed hyperpolarization was not blocked by mecamylamine, but rather it was blocked by methysergide suggesting it is serotonin-mediated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Depolarizing the LNs prior to CSDn stimulation demonstrates that this inhibition is indeed strong enough to prevent LN firing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013G</a>). We conducted a larger survey of LNs using voltage-clamp recordings and found nearly identical results (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data suggest that the CSDn may release two neurotransmitters that have opposing roles in the AL; acetylcholine, which is predominately excitatory and serotonin, which broadly inhibited these GABAergic LNs. Consistent with this notion, we found that the CSDn is labeled by the ChAT-Gal4 promoter line, and that it is immunopositive for both ChAT and VAchT (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Such stimulation is also likely to recruit polysynaptic pathways. We thus devised a new strategy called TERPS (Tetrodotoxin Engineered Resistance for Probing Synapses) to exclusively test for monosynaptic connections between neurons. We recorded from LNs in the presence of TTX to block all action potentials in the brain. We then selectively rescued spiking in the CSDn by co-expressing Chrimson and the TTX-insensitive sodium channel, NaChBac (<a href=\"#bib60\">Ren et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Nitabach et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). Brief pulses of red light resulted in broad plateau potentials in CSDns expressing NaChBac and Chrimson (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Such potentials were sufficient to elicit a brief depolarization and a strong hyperpolarization in LNs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). The hyperpolarization was blocked by methysergide, but neither methysergide nor mecamylamine blocked the depolarization (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). This depolarization is thus likely mediated by electrical coupling. Together these data show that the serotonergic connections from the CSDn to the LNs are likely monosynaptic, while the acetylcholinergic connections appear polysynaptic."

In <i>Drosophila</i>, such studies strongly emphasized modulation of the DA1 glomerulus\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Dacks et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Singh et al., 2013</a>) because of its sensitivity to the male pheromone cVA, which is critical for normal courtship behavior (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kurtovic et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dickson, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kohl et al., 2015</a>). We thus sought to test the effects of manipulating endogenous serotonin release on olfactory responses in the DA1 glomerulus. We first employed a pharmacological approach because it allows us to easily manipulate serotonergic transmission without altering Ach release from the CSDn. To reduce serotonergic transmission, we blocked postsynaptic receptors by adding the broad serotonin antagonist, methysergide to our recording saline (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Blocking serotonin receptors increased the odor responses of PNs innervating this glomerulus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and E</a>). This suggests that serotonin functions naturally to suppress DA1 responses and that methysergide removes this suppression. To elevate serotonin levels, we used the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Unlike the exogenous application of 5-HT, fluoxetine should specifically concentrate serotonin at naturally occurring release sites (<a href=\"#bib8\">Calvi\u00f1o and Szczupak, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Calvi\u00f1o et al., 2005</a>).

We performed similar experiments in flies by using a <i>tryptophan hydroxylase</i> (Trh) Gal4 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alekseyenko et al., 2010</a>) promoter line to express Chrimson in all serotonergic neurons. We stimulated this population strongly for 10 min using the same 10\u2009Hz sine wave of red light (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7A\u2013C</a>). Activation of the whole serotonergic system produced a long-lasting suppression of odor responses. First, these results are consistent with the role of endogenous 5-HT in flies being to suppress odor responses rather than to boost them as seen with exogenous application. Second, they suggest that 5-HT from sources other than the CSDn may contribute to the modulation of DA1 odor responses."

One mechanism by which serotonergic neurons other than the CSDn could influence AL circuits is by aiding in establishing a basal level of serotonin concentration in the fly haemolymph. In this model, all serotonin cells would contribute to tonic levels of circulating 5-HT and the DA1 would be sensitive to this serotonin. Alternatively, serotonin could modulate higher-order olfactory neurons that project back to the DA1 glomerulus. If either of these theories is true, then killing the CSDn should leave DA1 sensitive to serotonergic pharmacology. To test this theory, we expressed a temperature-dependent diphtheria toxin in the CSDns to kill them three days post eclosion (<a href=\"#bib27\">Han et al., 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This manipulation eliminated all 5-HT immunopositive processes in the antennal lobe, confirming that the CSDns are the only serotoninergic neurons to project to the AL in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dacks et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Singh et al., 2013</a>). Even in the absence of viable CSDns, the application of methysergide potentiated PN responses in the DA1 glomerulus (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E and F</a>), suggesting that serotonergic neurons outside the AL contribute in modulating PN responses. We also expressed diphtheria toxin in all 5-HT neurons using the Trh promoter (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). In this case, no potentiation was seen suggesting the boosting by methysergide was not caused by off target effects (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H and I</a>). These findings are consistent with the notion that the CSDn is likely not the serotonergic neuron responsible for the pharmacological effects seen in the DA1 glomerulus."

We thus repeated our experiments on the VA1d glomerulus, which responds to the female derived odor methyl laurate and whose cognate ORNs are necessary and sufficient for attraction in both males and females\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib19\">Dweck, 2015</a>). As with DA1, we saw no modulation of VA1d PN odor responses during chronic Chrimson activation of the CSDn (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and B</a>). In addition to chronic stimulation, we also applied brief pulses of light to drive the CSDn transiently during the peak of VA1d odor responses (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). This protocol revealed a small but significant increase in the VA1d responses during CSDn stimulation. This effect was observed only during the portion of the odor response in which the CSDn was being activated (Figure D and E). In total, CSDn activation added about 1 action potential per PN per odor response in this glomerulus. Because CSDn stimulation boosted rather than suppressed VA1d responses, it is more likely to be caused by acetylcholine from the CSDn rather than serotonin. Indeed, this small boost in VA1d firing was observed in the presence of methysergide, further suggesting it is not mediated by 5-HT (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). We repeated this brief stimulation protocol on the DA1 glomerulus, where we found no evidence of modulation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Such global suppression could serve as a gain control mechanism to prevent PN responses from saturating or to allow signals from glomeruli less sensitive to serotonin to be boosted relative to other glomeruli (<a href=\"#bib57\">Petzold et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dugu\u00e9 and Mainen, 2009</a>).

In these studies, the application of exogenous serotonin results in the boosting of olfactory responses in PNs. We attribute this difference to the mode of application, namely exogenous versus endogenous release. The influence of exogenous 5-HT is known to be concentration dependent, and low concentrations of 5-HT can suppress odor responses in PNs in moths (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kloppenburg and Hildebrand, 1995</a>). However, it is unlikely that concentration alone explains our phenomenon since even strong optogenetic activation of all 5-HT neurons elicits suppression of PN odor responses in our experiments."

For example, 5-HT7 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Becnel et al., 2011</a>) and 5-HT1B (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yuan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Singh et al., 2013</a>) receptors are both found in the AL of the fly, but the 5-HT7 receptor is fully saturated before the 5-HT1B receptor begins to show any sensitivity to 5-HT (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gasque et al., 2013</a>). Tonic bath application of serotonin might also preferentially activate one class of receptors, while phasic release from natural stores might favorably activate another class. Our data is consistent with these hypotheses. For example, we found that transient release of serotonin from the CSDn elicited only a brief excitatory inward current in LNs and PNs and a more prolonged outward inhibitory current (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, bath application of 5-HT resulted in a prolonged inward current that lasted the duration of 5-HT exposure (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Conflicting and opposing effects of serotonin have also been reported in other systems. In crayfish, the rate of bath application of serotonin determines whether it will facilitate or depress synaptic input onto command neurons that trigger escape behaviors (<a href=\"#bib71\">Teshiba et al., 2001</a>). Thus, the rate of change in serotonin concentration at CSDn to LN and PN synapses may be another reason why we observe differences in the modulation of odor responses with endogenous release and bath application."

Interestingly, we found that DA1 is highly sensitive to serotonergic pharmacology, yet largely insensitive to serotonin from the CSDn. In fact, DA1 sensitivity to serotonergic pharmacology remains even when the CSDn is ablated. This lack of DA1 sensitivity to CSDn-derived serotonin is consistent with the finding that this glomerulus is only weakly innervated by the CSDn (<a href=\"#bib66\">Singh et al., 2013</a>), but is still surprising given that the CSDn is the only serotonergic neuron that innervates the AL (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kent et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sun et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dacks et al., 2006</a>). We propose that one of two mechanisms might allow stimulation of the entire 5-HT network to strongly modulate DA1 odor responses where CSDn stimulation cannot. First, serotonin released from Trh-Gal4 stimulation may modulate cells outside the AL that are inaccessible to the CSDn and that ultimately feedback into the AL. Such a model could extend to most of the pheromone sensitive glomeruli in the antennal lobe as the VA1d glomerulus is also weakly innervated by the CSDn and shows weak modulation due to CSDn stimulation. Second, stimulation of Trh-Gal4 may elevate serotonin in the AL through paracrine signaling to levels higher than can be achieved by the CSDn alone. This paracrine or hormonal function for serotonin may not be so surprising considering serotonin can be readily measured in the haemolymph of many invertebrates (<a href=\"#bib55\">Panksepp et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Tecott, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lange et al., 1989</a>), and neuronal activity alone is sufficient to raise circulating 5-HT in invertebrate models (<a href=\"#bib46\">Levenson et al., 1999</a>). In the fly larvae, a single 30 s bout of activity in serotonergic neurons can drastically elevate 5-HT levels for several minutes as measured extracellularly by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borue et al., 2009</a>). At these concentration levels, 5-HT may be able to diffuse long distances within the fly nervous system."

Earlier studies proposed a polarity in the CSDn's neurites and suggested that it integrates input from higher protocerebral circuits to modulate the AL in a top-down manner (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dacks et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hill et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sun et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Roy et al., 2007</a>). Our data is more consistent with a recent suggestion that the CSDn forms local circuits operating at the level of each glomerulus (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kloppenburg and Mercer, 2008</a>). We found both pre- and postsynaptic specializations throughout virtually all glomeruli in the AL and confirmed that these connections are functional. Additionally, we show cellular correlates of both synaptic inputs and outputs in CSDn arbors within the LH (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Together this anatomical and physiological evidence argues at minimum that top-down modulation is not the exclusive function of the CSDn."

Both LNs and PNs are inhibited by serotonin from the CSDn and are indirectly excited by Ach during CSDn stimulation. Our immunohistochemistry assays suggest that the CSDn does likely release Ach. We\u00a0also observedthat blocking 5-HT transmission with methysergide has no effect on the postsynaptic depolarization of the LNs and PNs. Thus 5-HT cannot be the only means by which the CSDn communicates with AL neurons. However, the identity of the neurons that are monosynaptically connected to the CSDn via Ach remains unknown. Combining our TERPS strategy with calcium imaging and pharmacology should provide a powerful means to identify and disambiguate all of the serotonergic and cholinergic postsynaptic partners of the CSDn."

                                "text": "As mentioned above, CSDn stimulation alone was not sufficient to induce strong, lasting modulation in pheromone sensitive glomeruli. So what might be the function of CSDn connectivity within the AL? One possibility is that the CSDn robustly modulates non-pheromone channels. We performed a pilot study of randomly patched PNs from the dorsal medial cluster, but we never observed strong CSDn-mediated modulation (data not shown). An alternative hypothesis is that the CSDn might make odor responses more reliable across those glomeruli that it densely innervates. Functionally, the CSDn hyperpolarizes AL neurons through 5-HT and excites them in an Ach dependent manner. Interestingly, CSDn-evoked activity in PNs and LNs are virtually indistinguishable. At resting membrane potentials these synapses are quite weak as measured at the soma. Importantly though, the effect of CSDn stimulation became pronounced when LNs were depolarized by current injection and firing in LNs was suppressed via strong serotonergic inhibition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). CSDn stimulation also depolarized LNs more strongly when LNs where hyperpolarized from their resting potentials. This is consistent with the notion that the whichever active current is furthest from its reversal potential will dominate the net effect on the membrane potential. Thus CSDn spiking should serve to narrow the range of LN and PN activity, reduce membrane fluctuations arising from noise, and promote all odor responses to be initiated from a similar baseline. Subsequently, during the odor stimulus, the CSDn is inhibited through reciprocal synapses from LNs, and AL neurons are free to fire in a manner dictated by the odor itself. Such a configuration should reduce the variability in the absolute value of PN and LN responses across different presentations of the same olfactory stimulus resulting in more reliable olfactory coding."

Our results are qualitatively similar to recent studies addressing the effects of endogenous serotonin on olfaction in mice (<a href=\"#bib57\">Petzold et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kapoor et al., 2016</a>). In both cases, serotonin has a predominantly inhibitory effect on the principal neurons within the first olfactory relay, and broadly blocking serotonin receptors boosts odor responses in these same cells. In both mice and flies, serotonin is also likely released with a fast excitatory neurotransmitter, and the net effect of stimulating serotonergic cells on downstream neurons is brief excitation. In both mice (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kapoor et al., 2016</a>) and flies, the effects of brief activation of serotonergic neurons on odor responses appears to be mediated by their fast co-transmitter (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). And finally, only strong sustained activation of the entire serotonergic network leads to a long-lasting suppression of odor responses in mice (<a href=\"#bib57\">Petzold et al., 2009</a>) and flies."

One such question is what stimuli evoke activity in raphe neurons that specifically project to the OB. Previous studies have reported dynamic odor responses in raphe neurons during olfactory tasks(<a href=\"#bib59\">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen et al., 2015</a>), but the axons of these cells could not be traced back to the OB. It is therefore always possible that their olfactory receptive fields are being generated by input from higher-cortical areas. In one study, a subset of raphe neurons showed significant inhibition during odor sampling(<a href=\"#bib59\">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</a>). These cells could serve the analogous function of the CSDn in mice if they indeed project to the OB. A second question that is common to both mice and flies is why robust serotonergic modulation is only observed with strong stimulation of the entire serotonergic network, and importantly, what might cause this type of activity. Given the similarities of serotonergic modulation in the olfactory systems of mice and flies, studies in the CSDn should shed light into the function and organization of serotonergic modulation in mammalian model systems."

In brief, a carrier stream of carbon-filtered house air was presented at 2.2L/min to the fly continuously. A solenoid was used to redirect 200\u2009ml/min of this air stream into an odor vial before rejoining the carrier stream, thus diluting the odor a further 10-fold prior to reaching the animal. All odors are reported as v/v dilutions in paraffin oil (J.T. Baker VWR #JTS894), except for acids, which were diluted in distilled water. All odors were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO) except for cVA, which was obtained from Pherobank (Wageningen, Netherlands). A complete list of odors used can be found in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>. cVA and methyl laurate were delivered as pure odorants. In our olfactometer design, the odor vial path was split to 10 channels each with a different odor or solvent control. Pinch valves (Clark Solutions, Hudson MA part number PS1615W24V) were used to select stimuli between each trial. Thus for <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, each odor was presented sequentially one trial at a time. Each odor was presented 4\u20136 times within a preparation and the mean of these responses were then averaged across animals. For <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, An odor was presented every 30 s, but the same odor was never presented twice within 90 s to prevent depletion of the odor vial's headspace. For figures involving only cVA, the odor was presented every 80 s. For <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, seven different vials of ammonia were utilized, and we cycled our odor presentation through each vial sequentially, again to prevent headspace depletion. We found it critical to flush the olfactometer lines overnight prior to each experiment to prevent odor contamination defined as CSDn responses to empty odor vials or solvent-only control vials. As the CSDn likely integrates input from all LNs (based on our estimation of connectivity probability), it is not surprising that even small amount of residual odor in the olfactometer can create odor responses to solvent controls."

For whole cell recordings, a small hyperpolarizing current was applied to offset the depolarization caused by the pipette seal conductance. Their resting potentials were adjusted slightly to match the firing rate of similar neurons obtained in cell-attached recordings. Neurons which did not fire spontaneously or that had depolarized membrane potentials upon break-in were excluded from the study. Cells were held at -60 mV for voltage clamp recordings. For these experiments, the antenna of the fly was removed to minimize potential polysynaptic contributions of the ORNs during CSDn stimulation."

This line is referred to as CSDn-Gal4 throughout the manuscript and labels the CSDn and only a small set of additional neurons (<a href=\"#bib66\">Singh et al., 2013</a>). These other neurons were never visible under epifluorescence in our recording set up. The CSDn is unambiguously identifiable as the only visible GFP-positive neuron under our epifluorescence microscopes (Zeiss Axioscop with Thorlabs LED model M470L3 and Dage MTI IR-1000 camera). The cell is located on the posterior lateral edge of the antennal lobe and has a large soma size, large action potentials (&gt;30 mV), and a low spontaneous firing rate of 1\u20132\u2009Hz. Initially, we used biocytin cell fills to confirm this cell to be the CSDn, but we subsequently relied only on GFP labeling, cell size, position, and physiology to confirm its identity in later recordings. DA1 PNs were labeled using the Q/QUAS system (<a href=\"#bib58\">Potter et al., 2010</a>) with the MZ19-QF promoter. These cells were identified based on their soma location in the lateral cluster of the antennal lobe and responsiveness to cVA. This allowed us to specifically target DA1 PNs while manipulating the CSDn using the Gal4/UAS system. VA1d was also identified in Mz19-QF, but was located dorsally and medially. This cell did not respond appreciably to cVA, but did respond to methyl laurate. For pharmacological experiments, DM6 and DL5 were identified in the NP3062 promoter line (under Gal4/UAS expression) by their unique odor responses, positions, and size (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gaudry et al., 2013</a>). Randomly selected LNs were identified as LNs based on their large soma size and high amplitude action potentials. They are believed to be GABAergic as they were located in the dorsal lateral cluster and had physiology characteristic of GABAergic LNs. Glutamatergic LNs are located ventrally (<a href=\"#bib49\">Liu and Wilson, 2013</a>) and eLNs can be identified by their characteristic IPSPs (<a href=\"#bib75\">Yaksi and Wilson, 2010</a>). We are thus confident that the LNs that we sampled are GABAergic. Random PNs were selected from the medial dorsal cluster and generally had small soma sizes and action potentials."

We confirmed this by depolarizing each neuron and observing that they could no longer fire action potentials. Generally, evoked responses in saline were much larger compared to responses after the addition of TTX, suggesting that polysynaptic connections do exist. Stimulation of CSDns expressing NaChBac resulted in large plateau potentials consistent with the slow inactivation kinetics of the NaChBac channel (<a href=\"#bib60\">Ren et al., 2001</a>). In some preparations spontaneous NaChBac plateau potentials could be seen during CSDn recordings. Similarly, in some LN recordings, we observed spontaneous hyperpolarizations that were indistinguishable from CSDn evoked hyperpolarizations. These spontaneous events were also completely blocked by methysergide. This suggests that they are serotonergic and likely originate from the CSDn. The residual depolarization left after mecamylamine and methysergide application was insensitive to Cd<sup>++</sup> application. We thus believe it to be mediated by electrical coupling. As gap junctions are generally low pass filters, it is reasonable that the broad NaChBac spike might be transmitted more efficiently from the CSDn to postsynaptic cells compared to a burst of typical fast spikes. We also tested this approach in the cVA circuit of the fly by patching third order cVA sensitive neurons in the lateral horn(<a href=\"#bib41\">Kohl et al., 2013</a>). Here we found that chronic expression of NaChBac dramatically altered the synaptic connectivity between DA1 PNs and these neurons in the lateral horn such that responses no longer resembled previously published reports. Therefore caution should be exercised when chronically expressing NaChBac to assess connectivity in any system."

Two-tailed one sample t-tests were performed in our voltage-clamp analysis to compare the size of currents with the baseline after baseline subtraction (testing against a mean of zero). A repeated measures ANOVA was performed for multiple comparisons between two or more drug treatments and controls within the same group. A one-way ANOVA was performed for <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> because each preparation did not receive every treatment. A Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test was performed after each ANOVA."

By using different electrophysiological methods, such as whole-cell and voltage clamp recordings, combined with optogenetics manipulations, the authors show that these CSDns are mainly inhibited by odor application through reciprocal synapses deriving within the antennal lobe. Moreover, the authors reveal that CSDns release multiple transmitters, namely in addition to serotonin, the excitatory transmitter acetyl choline. Both transmitters seem to have opposing effects and time courses on their target neurons. Finally by performing a series of experiments, the authors provide evidence that this serotonergic network modulates odor-evoked responses of olfactory projection neurons."

The authors spend a lot of time on negative results at this point in the manuscript, leading to an increasingly confused reader. Why did the authors choose to activate CSDns with ammonia before optogenetic activation? In fact, all methods that selectively activate the CSDNs fail to modulate PNs. And yet a 5HT antagonist and a 5HT reuptake inhibitor do modulate them. Also, activating the whole 5HT system modulates PN output. The authors attribute that to some facilitation of CSDn efficacy by other 5HT neurons. While that is possible, they are not able to test whether the CSDns are even necessary for the effects of activating the whole 5HT system. How certain is it that CSDns are the sole source of AL 5HT in flies? While these conflicting results could be simply explained if there were an alternative source of 5HT to the AL the results of Roy et al. and Dacks et al. suggest otherwise. So, these nettles should be grasped in the discussion and addressed."

By using different electrophysiological methods, such as whole-cell and voltage clamp recordings, combined with optogenetics manipulations, the authors show that these CSDns are mainly inhibited by odor application through reciprocal synapses deriving within the antennal lobe. Moreover, the authors reveal that CSDns release multiple transmitters, namely in addition to serotonin, the excitatory transmitter acetyl choline. Both transmitters seem to have opposing effects and time courses on their target neurons.

Specifically, we refocused much of the manuscript around pheromone processing and the DA1 glomerulus and we leave open the possibility that other olfactory channels might be modulated more strongly by the CSDn. We still believe the interaction between the CSDn and this glomerulus is of critical importance as cVA processing and the DA1 glomerulus are critical for proper courtship behavior (a widely studied model system). Unfortunately, we tried to develop a LexA-CSDn line to stimulate the CSDn and label other non-pheromone PNs with the Gal4/UAS system, but this new line did not label the CSDn."

They are labeled much more weakly than the CSDn and are never visible at our patch-clamping rigs. We only observe these cells on occasion during confocal imaging and none of these other neurons are labeled with the 5-HT antibody. Gal4 expression is often graded and we find the CSDn to be by far the most strongly labeled cell in this line. We thus attribute our findings to the CSDn. We reference Singh et al. 2013 regarding the specificity of the R60F02-Gal4 line. Our observations regarding the expression patterns of R60F02-Gal4 are largely in agreement with their publication with the exception that we saw less labeling in VA1d.

All of these odors including geranyl acetate inhibit the CSDn. Thus even if the CSDn receives monosynaptic input from a few ORNs, it is still likely that activation of those ORNs will inhibit the CSDn, as long as the same odor recruits enough LN activity.

Glutamatergic LNs are located in the most ventral region of the antennal lobe and are inaccessible in our preparation. To access Glu LNs, we must rotate the head of the fly 180\u00b0 and patch from the ventral side (Liu and Wilson, 2013). Additionally, GABA and Glu LNs can be distinguished physiologically as Glu LNs have much smaller action potential amplitudes. Acetylcholinergic eLNs are also located more ventrally and have a very characteristic physiological hallmark of continuous barrages of IPSPs (Yaksi and Wilson, 2010). Thus we are confident that the soma location, spike amplitude, and subthreshold activity are sufficient to classify these neurons as GABAergic LNs. However, we certainly do acknowledge that even these GABAergic LNs likely represent a very diverse population, and that our approach must result in a sampling bias towards only dorsal lateral GABA LNs."

Glutamate in the AL tends to be inhibitory (Liu and Wilson, 2013). The two best candidates are the ORNs themselves or the PNs. Recent EM work in the larvae has shown the CSDn to receive monosynaptic input from only two ORN classes. It is possible that once inhibition is blocked in the AL, the excitation from these ORN classes is revealed. Additionally, we recorded from the CSDn while stimulating most PNs with channelrhodopsin (Q-GH146 &gt; QUAS-ChR2) and found that activation of the PNs can cause a small depolarization in the CSDn. We believe any source of excitation is simply masked when inhibition is intact."

Spike-triggered averages from dual recordings failed to reveal monosynaptic connections between these cells presumably because single-spike-evoked potentials are small. To see any effect postsynaptically, we have to drive a lot of activity in the CSDn, which inherently recruits polysynaptic circuits. These connections were actually presumed from earlier work in flies and moths that suggested that the CSDn synapses onto LNs and PNs. To address the reviewer and to test these connections directly, we developed a new strategy for assessing monosynaptic connections. This approach should work in any model system. In short we block all activity in the brain with tetrodotoxin and rescue spiking selectively in the CSDn through the expression of the TTX-insensitive sodium channel, NaChBac. This approach worked successfully at the cholinergic ORN to LN synapse and for all 5-HT synapses from the CSDn. It did however reveal that all of the acetylcholine effects from the CSDn onto the LNs and PNs are likely polysynaptic. However, it remains certain that the CSDn must still communicate within the AL through a means other than 5-HT alone. This is because methysergide does not block the excitation of LNs and PNs during CSDn stimulation in saline. Thus the CSDn must still either use Ach in the AL or communicate with cholinergic neurons via gap junction coupling. The identity of the monosynaptic cholinergic partners of the CSDn remain unknown."

We reason that the hard wiring of the circuit would remain the same in both instances and thus both methods of application should have the same effect. We believe that the differences are likely seen do to either the overall concentration of 5-HT or the accessibility of 5-HT to extrasynaptic receptors. Gasque et al. 2013 showed that the fly 5-HT7 receptor is fully saturated prior to concentrations where 5-HT1B receptors even begin to activate. These two receptors have opposite effects on cAMP and have both been implicated in the AL. The exogenous concentrations of 5-HT used in these studies are generally quite high and may simply saturate one or both receptor types in a manner that is never achieved but exogenous release."

The authors spend a lot of time on negative results at this point in the manuscript, leading to an increasingly confused reader. Why did the authors choose to activate CSDns with ammonia before optogenetic activation? In fact, all methods that selectively activate the CSDNs fail to modulate PNs. And yet a 5HT antagonist and a 5HT reuptake inhibitor do modulate them. Also, activating the whole 5HT system modulates PN output. The authors attribute that to some facilitation of CSDn efficacy by other 5HT neurons. While that is possible, they are not able to test whether the CSDns are even necessary for the effects of activating the whole 5HT system. How certain is it that CSDns are the sole source of AL 5HT in flies? While these conflicting results could be simply explained if there were an alternative source of 5HT to the AL the results of Roy et al. and Dacks et al. suggest otherwise.

The first explanation is that serotonin from non-CSDn neurons may modulate downstream neurons that feedback into the AL and into the DA1 glomerulus. There are known projections for other studies that show higher order feedback into the AL. The second possible mechanism is that the DA1 glomerulus may be sensitive to 5-HT in the haemolymph or extracellular space and that serotonin may reach the antennal lobe from outside via paracrine signaling. Our data is consistent with either of these models. Importantly though, our data refute a simple model that the CSDn is responsible for all olfactory modulation. We propose that this may hold true for all olfactory channels (including VA1d), and this should be of general interest in fly olfaction."
