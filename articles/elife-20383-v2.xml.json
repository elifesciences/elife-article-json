                    "text": "Invasion of erythrocytes by <i>Plasmodial</i> merozoites is a composite process involving the interplay of several proteins. Among them, the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Cysteine-Rich Protective Antigen (PfCyRPA) is a crucial component of a ternary complex, including Reticulocyte binding-like Homologous protein 5 (PfRH5) and the RH5-interacting protein (PfRipr), essential for erythrocyte invasion. Here, we present the crystal structures of PfCyRPA and its complex with the antigen-binding fragment of a parasite growth inhibitory antibody. PfCyRPA adopts a 6-bladed \u03b2-propeller structure with similarity to the classic sialidase fold, but it has no sialidase activity and fulfills a purely non-enzymatic function. Characterization of the epitope recognized by protective antibodies may facilitate design of peptidomimetics to focus vaccine responses on protective epitopes. Both in vitro and in vivo anti-PfCyRPA and anti-PfRH5 antibodies showed more potent parasite growth inhibitory activity in combination than on their own, supporting a combined delivery of PfCyRPA and PfRH5 in vaccines."

Among them, the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Cysteine-Rich Protective Antigen (PfCyRPA) is a crucial component of a ternary complex, including Reticulocyte binding-like Homologous protein 5 (PfRH5) and the RH5-interacting protein (PfRipr), essential for erythrocyte invasion. Here, we present the crystal structures of PfCyRPA and its complex with the antigen-binding fragment of a parasite growth inhibitory antibody. PfCyRPA adopts a 6-bladed \u03b2-propeller structure with similarity to the classic sialidase fold, but it has no sialidase activity and fulfills a purely non-enzymatic function. Characterization of the epitope recognized by protective antibodies may facilitate design of peptidomimetics to focus vaccine responses on protective epitopes. Both in vitro and in vivo anti-PfCyRPA and anti-PfRH5 antibodies showed more potent parasite growth inhibitory activity in combination than on their own, supporting a combined delivery of PfCyRPA and PfRH5 in vaccines."

In a first step, we tested a combination of inhibitory mAbs against the two antigens in an in vitro parasite growth inhibition assay. Parasites were cultured for one cycle of merozoite invasion in the presence of the anti-PfCyRPA c12 mAb with or without the anti-PfRH5 BS1.2 mAb at concentrations of 500, 250, and 125 \u03bcg/mL. Either mAbs showed potent inhibitory activity, consistently reducing parasite growth of all four tested <i>P. falciparum</i> strains in a concentration-dependent manner and to the same extent as the well characterized inhibitory anti-MSP-1 mAb 12.10 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blackman et al., 1990</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When combining the anti-PfCyRPA c12 mAb with the anti-RH5 BS1.2 mAb, we found a significantly enhanced inhibitory activity: while mAbs c12 and BS1.2 at a concentration of 250 \u00b5g/mL inhibited growth by 21% \u00b1 2.2% and 31% \u00b1 4.6%, respectively, the combination of both mAbs (250 \u00b5g/mL each) inhibited growth by 59% \u00b1 1.4%; (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The functional activity of both mAbs was not enhanced by the addition of a malaria-unrelated control mAb."

Mass spectrometric analysis of proteolytic fragments of PfCyRPA revealed at least four disulfide bonds that are sequential along the sequence (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Intrinsic fluorescence showed that the two Trp residues present in PfCyRPA are buried in the native state.

The crystal structure of PfCyRPA, determined to a resolution of 2.5 \u00c5 (detailed in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), confirmed our biophysical analyses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). PfCyRPA adopts a six-bladed \u03b2-propeller structure that buries the disulfide bonds and the Trp residues. Each blade of the propeller is constructed by a four-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The five disulfide bonds in PfCyRPA are located within blades 2\u20136 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), stabilizing each individual blade. The first blade has no disulfide bond; it is formed by \u03b2-strands from the N- and C-terminal regions of PfCyRPA, potentially enabling conformational changes in PfCyRPA by opening and closing. A domain alignment search (DALI; [<a href=\"#bib33\">Holm and Rosenstr\u00f6m, 2010</a>]) for related structures revealed that PfCyRPA adopts a heavily modified sialidase/neuraminidase fold. The closest structural relative is the catalytic domain of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> sialidase (<a href=\"#bib48\">Moustafa et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The two proteins have only 9% sequence identity and the structures have a large root mean square distance (rmsd) of 3.7 \u00c5 over 285 residues, clearly showing that while the overall fold is similar, the structures are very different with respect to the inclination of the blades (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and the length and conformations of the surface loops connecting the \u03b2-strands (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

The minimum is remote from the minima expected for helical (208 nm and 222 nm) and random coil (200 nm) structures. (<b>B</b>) Identification of disulfide bonds in PfCyRPA. The peptide fragments are labeled K (LysC cleavage), D (AspN cleavage), and T (trypsin cleavage). A cut-off of 2% signal intensity was applied to separate highly populated from less populated fragments. Masses that correspond to two proteolytic peptides connected by disulfide bonds were repeatedly found (parentheses) when using different proteases. An equal sign (=) signifies a disulfide bond and a minus sign (\u2212 ) signifies a skipped cleavage. For instance, the first disulfide bond between Cys48 and Cys64 was identified four times in the LysC hydrolysate: K2\u00a0=\u00a0K3 corresponds to the mass of the second and third expected proteolytic fragment linked by a disulfide bond. K2\u00a0=\u00a0K3\u20134 is the second expected LysC peptide (K2) disulfide-linked to a larger peptide (K3\u2013K4) that still contains a LysC cleavage site but this site was not recognized by the enzyme. The same reasoning applies to K2\u00a0=\u00a0K3\u20135, where two LysC cleavage sites were not recognized. An asterisk (*) denotes a disulfide bond in a peptide. The K2-4* fragment has a mass corresponding to an un-cleaved and disulfide-linked peptide with two intact LysC cleavage sites that were not recognized. The last disulfide bond ion PfCyRPA between Cys303/327 was not identified by any protease, possibly due to low abundance of the proteolytic fragments containing it. (<b>C</b>) The fluorescence emission spectrum of native PfCyRPA (black) shows a maximum at 326 nm that shifts to 338 nm when heated to 70\u00b0C (red) or 355 nm when unfolded by 9 M urea (blue). Addition of 50 mM DTT (magenta) has no significant effect on the fluorescence, suggesting that the disulfide bonds are not solvent-accessible. The unusual finding that the Trp fluorescence quantum yield of the unfolded state is higher than in the native state indicates that the excited state of Trp is efficiently quenched by nearby residues in the native structure (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen and Barkley, 1998</a>)."

In view of the involvement of viral and microbial sialidases in the unmasking of cryptic host ligands, host cell adhesion, and invasion (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lewis and Lewis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Matrosovich et al., 2015</a>), sialidase activity could make sense for PfCyRPA-mediated invasion of erythrocytes. We detected no sialidase activity, however, when we tested recombinant PfCyRPA for neuraminidase activity using a colorimetric assay (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The active site of sialidases usually contains a triad of Arg residues that bind to the substrate, a Glu/Tyr pair where the acid acts as a general base to activate the Tyr nucleophile, and a hydrophobic pocket with a conserved Trp that accommodates the acetyl group of sialic acid (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buschiazzo and Alzari, 2008</a>). In addition, many sialidases bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, of which one is close to the active site and is bound by three main-chain carbonyl groups and oxygen atoms in the side-chains of Asn, Thr, and Asp. PfCyRPA contains none of the residues necessary for catalysis, nor does it harbor a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site, providing structural correlates of the absence of sialidase activity in PfCyRPA. PfCyRPA and sialidases may have evolved from a common ancestor, or PfCyRPA could have evolved from a genuine sialidase to adopt other functionalities."

Actinase E treatment of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex resulted in the same proteolysis pattern as observed for PfCyRPA alone (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), suggesting that the epitope for mAb c12 is distant from the Actinase E recognition site at Asp189. Actinase E treatment was not necessary to crystallize the PfCyRPA/c12 complex, however. We determined the crystal structure of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex at a resolution of 4.0 \u00c5 by molecular replacement using the individual high-resolution structures of c12 and PfCyRPA as search models (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Despite the limited resolution, novel molecular features were visible in the electron density maps of the complex, providing confidence in the relative orientation of PfCyRPA and c12 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). First, the electron density visible for PfCyRPA after molecular replacement with c12 was used as a search model for structure determination of PfCyRPA alone (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). This strategy would have been impossible had the placement of c12 been wrong. Second, a loop region that is absent in the PfCyRPA search model due to Actinase E proteolysis (see above) exhibits omit electron density in the PfCyRPA/c12 complex (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Third, consistent with the similar conformations of the CDR loops in the individual c12 Fab structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) there are negligible conformational changes in the c12 CDR loops when bound to PfCyRPA. Similarly, the epitope conformation in PfCyRPA is very similar in the unbound and complexed form. Minor adjustments of side-chains were required during rebuilding of the complex structure. While the resolution of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex is limited and many side-chains lack clear electron density, as is typical for this resolution, knowledge of the relative orientation of PfCyRPA with respect to c12 in the complex is sufficient for designing peptidomimetics to target the immune response to the protective epitope."

The most frequent amino acid dimorphism of PfCyRPA at position 339 is thus located outside the epitope recognized by mAb c12, consistent with the observation that mAb c12 binds to <i>P. falciparum</i> independent of the PfCyRPA variant they express (<a href=\"#bib26\">Dreyer et al., 2012</a>). mAb c12 buries a total surface area of 950 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> on PfCyRPA with the major contributor being the light chain, which buries 520 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, while the heavy chain buries only 430 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>. The surface complementarity coefficient Sc of the complex is 0.67, a typical value for antibody-antigen interactions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lawrence and Colman, 1993</a>); a value of one would denote perfect complementarity. The light chain also forms more potential hydrogen bonds to PfCyRPA than the heavy chain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Seven hydrogen bonds are possible between PfCyRPA and the c12 light chain. Each side-chain of light chain CDR1 residues 50-RND-52 can form a hydrogen bond with the side-chains of PfCyRPA residues Asp66, Asn45, and Tyr78, respectively. A particularly large contribution to complex stability may stem from a salt bridge between PfCyRPA residue Asp66 and CDR1 residue Arg50, which by mutagenesis was found to be true (see below), a further confirmation that the PfCyRPA/c12 complex structure is correct. In addition, the heavy chain contributes significantly to antigen binding. Tyr120 of heavy chain CDR3 can engage in two hydrogen bonds with the side-chains of PfCyRPA residues Asp92 in blade two and Tyr144 in blade 3, thus establishing a mini-network that bridges blades 2 and 3. Together with heavy chain CDR3 residue Tyr122, Tyr120 also forms numerous van der Waals interactions with Asn91, Lys95, Glu96, and Phe136, Tyr144, Asn145, and Asn146 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and C</a>). A complete listing of the derived potential interactions is available in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>, which due to the limited resolution of the complex structure must remain tentative. What is clear from the structure is that mAb c12 recognizes a discontinuous epitope that contains at least 17 residues distributed over four PfCyRPA sequence stretches (marked in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

PfCyRPA is stage-specifically expressed in late schizonts and elicits mAbs that inhibit parasite growth in vitro and in a <i>P. falciparum</i> experimental infection model based on NODscidIL2R\u03b3null mice engrafted with human erythrocytes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Dreyer et al., 2012</a>). Recent studies (<a href=\"#bib58\">Reddy et al., 2015</a>) have placed PfCyRPA in a ternary complex with PfRH5 and PfRipr that as a whole is essential for erythrocyte invasion (<a href=\"#bib64\">Volz et al., 2016</a>). Like PfRH5 and PfRipr (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2011b</a>), PfCyRPA is refractory to genetic disruption (<a href=\"#bib58\">Reddy et al., 2015</a>), and loss of PfCyRPA or PFRH5 function in conditionally expressing mutants blocks parasite growth due to the inability of merozoites to invade erythrocytes (<a href=\"#bib64\">Volz et al., 2016</a>). Here, we show that antibodies against PfRH5 and PfCyRPA have additive parasite growth inhibitory activity. Inclusion of both antigens into a multivalent subunit vaccine therefore represents an attractive strategy to prevent emergence of escape mutants. While an ortholog of PfCyRPA is also present in the genome of the human parasite <i>P. vivax</i>, an ortholog of PfRH5 has only been found so far in the genome of <i>P. reichenowi</i>, a chimpanzee malaria parasite closely related to <i>P. falciparum</i> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Otto et al., 2014</a>). This may indicate a function of PfCyRPA beyond its role as a protein-binding platform in the ternary complex with PfRH5 and PfRipr. While it has been claimed that PfCyRPA anchors the ternary complex through a GPI anchor to the parasite membrane (<a href=\"#bib58\">Reddy et al., 2015</a>), recent results are not consistent with this suggestion (<a href=\"#bib64\">Volz et al., 2016</a>). This inconsistency suggests that additional proteins might be involved in anchoring the complex to the parasite membrane and that PfCyRPA has an essential function other than that of an anchor. Further functional studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms how the ternary complex is involved in the triggering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and the establishment of tight junctions between the merozoite and the erythrocytes (<a href=\"#bib64\">Volz et al., 2016</a>). In this context, it may be relevant that the five sequential disulfide bonds of PfCyRPA are in blades 1\u20135, leaving blade 6 of the \u03b2-propeller structure without such a local stabilization. Blade six is constructed by \u03b2-strands from the N- and the C-terminus, and in principle could act as a gate to allow PfCyRPA to undergo substantial conformational changes."

A non-glycosylated variant of PfCyRPA (residues Asp29\u2013Glu362, N145Q/N322Q/N338Q) did not yield well-diffracting crystals unless pre-treated with proteases. 1 mg/mL PfCyRPA in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl was diluted 1:1 with 10 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, subjected for 16 hr to a panel of twelve proteases (Hampton Research Proti-Ace Kit) at a final concentration of 0.01 mg/mL, and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Of the proteases that changed the apparent molecular mass of PfCyRPA, subtilisin and proteinase K produced multiple bands, while Glu-C, elastase, and thermolysin produced a single band of slightly smaller apparent molecular mass. The thermolysin-treated PfCyRPA was subjected to crystallization, yielding triclinic crystals upon mixing of 120 nL 7.3 mg/mL PfCyRPA in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl with 80 nL of precipitant consisting of 0.2 M LiOAc and 20% (w/v) PEG 3350. These crystals are consistent with four molecules per unit cell but did not diffract X-rays beyond a resolution of 3.3 \u00c5. Actinase E-treatment of PfCyRPA results in a different proteolysis pattern with two bands of apparent molecular mass 17 kDa and 20 kDa (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thin, plate-shaped monoclinic crystals diffracting to a maximum resolution of about 2.5 \u00c5 were obtained from mixing of 100 or 140 nL 15 mg/mL Actinase E-treated PfCyRPA in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl with 100 nL and 60 nL precipitants consisting of 0\u20130.5 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 20\u201325% PEG 3350.

Data collected from crystals grown in the presence of the heavier cations were tested for anomalous and isomorphous information content for phasing, which turned out to be negative."

However, all attempts using several hundred \u03b2-propeller structures as search models both with and without loop regions and/or as poly-Ala models were unsuccessful. Sialidases often contain structural Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which prompted co-crystallization of PfCyRPA with the earth alkali cations Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Sr<sup>2+</sup>, and Ba<sup>2+</sup> for SIRAS phasing, but none of these provided useful derivatives. Attempts to phase the PfCyRPA diffraction data by sulfur-SAD were also unsuccessful. Packing density estimations indicated two molecules of PfCyRPA in the monoclinic asymmetric unit. The PfCyRPA data could be phased by molecular replacement using the unexplained electron density of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex (see below) as a search model. The volume of density was separated using a mask, placed in a large cubic cell, and back transformed to yield structure factor amplitudes, which were then used in a PHASER (<a href=\"#bib63\">The collaborative computational project number 4, 1994</a>) molecular replacement search for two molecules. The solution had a non-random log-likelihood gain of LLG\u00a0=\u00a0175 and the orientations of the two entities replicated the 180\u00b0 two-fold NCS (non-crystallographic symmetry) estimated from the self-rotation function. Density averaging using PARROT (<a href=\"#bib63\">The collaborative computational project number 4, 1994</a>) and the NCS operator defined by the two PHASER solutions resulted in manually interpretable electron density maps. The final model has a discontinuity at Asp189, which is consistent with cleavage of a surface loop by Actinase E. A symmetry-related PfCyRPA occupies the space liberated by the cleaved loop, explaining the necessity of the proteolytic pre-treatment for crystal formation in this setting. The model was refined using automatically generated NCS restraints excluding diverging surface loop regions. 99.5% of all residues are in the favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. The hexagonal dataset of c12 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) was phased by molecular replacement using a homology model generated from the c12 sequence in MOE (Chemical Computing Group) as the search model. Separate searches for the variable and constant parts of the Fab were performed in PHASER, which, as anticipated, placed the V<sub>H</sub>V<sub>L</sub> and C<sub>H</sub>C<sub>L</sub> domain boundaries close to each other to generate a complete Fab. The final model has 99.2% of all residues in the favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. The monoclinic and orthorhombic c12 datasets were phased using the refined hexagonal c12 structure as molecular replacement search model. Both structures have 98% of their main-chain torsion angles in the favored region of the Ramachandran plot. Elbow angles were calculated with PHENIX (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>)."

Molecular replacement readily placed c12, and initial maps calculated from this partial solution revealed additional electron density at the tips of the Fab (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which occupied a volume large enough to host PfCyRPA. The density resembled a \u03b2-propeller but was not interpretable due to the limited resolution of the data. However, this density provided enough phasing power to solve the 2.5 \u00c5 PfCyRPA structure (see above), showing that the placement of the Fab was correct. The same arrangement of V<sub>H</sub>V<sub>L</sub> and C<sub>H</sub>C<sub>L</sub> was obtained when using the V<sub>H</sub>V<sub>L</sub> and C<sub>H</sub>C<sub>L</sub> parts of the Fab as separate search models, indicating that the elbow angle of c12 does not change upon binding to PfCyRPA. The final model of PfCyRPA was used to complete the molecular replacement phasing of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex (log-likelihood gain of\u00a0&gt;1260), density for which is shown in <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. A loop region not present in the PfCyRPA model could be traced in the electron density of the complex (Panel B in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), establishing confidence in the correctness of the molecular replacement solution. The model of the complex was refined according to established protocols for lower resolution structures (<a href=\"#bib17\">DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2006</a>), that\u00a0is using simulated annealing, group ADP values, automatically assigned TLS definitions, secondary structure restraints, and external restraints provided by the higher resolution individual structures of PfCyRPA and c12. No real-space refinement was applied during building and refinement of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex. Strong geometric restraints were applied throughout model building of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex. All models were built with COOT (<a href=\"#bib29\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>) and refined with PHENIX (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>)."

CyRPA and RH5 are both candidate vaccine immunogens, as antibodies directed against these proteins potently neutralize parasites. This manuscript extends our knowledge of antibody neutralization by showing that single monoclonals against CyRPA and RH5 act additively to provide enhanced neutralization. This result suggests that combined use of both proteins may be beneficial for vaccine development."

The authors also describe a structure of CyRPA bound with the Fab of neutralizing antibody c12, at to a reported 3.6 \u00c5 resolution, and validate the interaction site using a single point mutant and truncation analysis. For the most part the antibody data and the structure of CyRPA alone appear to be well done, but the reviewers have substantive concerns with the structure of CyRPA in complex with c12. Both structures are timely and relevant for the future of malaria vaccines, and the manuscript would have been suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i> were the structural results for the c12 complex more solid. If the structure with c12 has problems, the vaccine development focus of the manuscript is not justified and the manuscript less compelling overall. There are also concerns about the experiments on additivity of antibodies directed against RH5 and CyRPA, the other novel claim. We invite the authors to consider responding with a revised manuscript (and appropriate experiments and computations) to the concerns summarized below. We caution that relatively extensive new information will be required for a favorable outcome."

Since both structures have been refined at quite high resolution, and since even the CDR loops of the Fabs do not vary much from crystal form to crystal form, it seems quite odd that the complex is so poorly determined. Specific points to consider are some red flags from data reduction statistics. Using the CC1/2 as the resolution cutoff criterion gives Rmeas of 59.5 in the outer bin (high for a low symmetry space group like P21) and I/sig(I) of 0.4 (and only 2.6 for the entire dataset). Since the elbow varies a bit among Fab c12 crystal forms, did the authors use the variable and constant modules as separate MR search objects when determining the structure of the complex?"

Also, the molecular replacement solution, judged by the same result using two different approaches, must be correct. Another strong argument for the correctness of the molecular replacement solution of the complex is the fact that when placing only the Fab, the remaining electron density, although uninterpretable, could be used as a search model for phasing the PfCyRPA data. We are convinced that this phasing strategy would not have been possible had the Fab been placed wrongly. This has been emphasized in the Methods section by stating: \u201cMolecular replacement readily placed c12, and initial maps calculated from this partial solution revealed additional electron density at the tips of the Fab (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which occupied a volume large enough to host PfCyRPA. [\u2026] The same arrangement of Fv and Fc was obtained when using the Fv and Fc parts of the Fab as separate search models, indicating that the elbow angle of c12 does not change upon binding to PfCyRPA.\u201d"
