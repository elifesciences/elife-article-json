Mechanisms that regulate the appropriate timing of cell cycle withdrawal of these neuronal progenitors during brain development are not well defined. The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) is highly expressed in the proliferating GCPs, but is downregulated once the cells leave the cell cycle. This receptor has primarily been characterized as a death receptor for its ability to induce neuronal apoptosis following injury. Here we demonstrate a novel function for p75<sup>NTR</sup> in regulating proper cell cycle exit of neuronal progenitors in the developing rat and mouse EGL, which is stimulated by proNT3. In the absence of p75<sup>NTR</sup>, GCPs continue to proliferate beyond their normal period, resulting in a larger cerebellum that persists into adulthood, with consequent motor deficits."

The progenitor cells of mutant mice that lack this protein produced too many new cells, which resulted in these mice having larger cerebellums and being less able to control their movements. Further experiments showed that p75<sup>NTR</sup> interacts with a neurotrophin called proNT3 in the cerebellum, which is able to stop granule progenitor cells dividing even in the presence of other proteins that encourage cells to divide. An important challenge for the future is to work out why the mice lacking p75<sup>NTR</sup> are less able to control their movements."

In the early stages of cerebellar formation, granule cell progenitors (GCPs) originate from the rhombic lip of the fourth ventricle and migrate to the anlage of the developing cerebellum forming the external granule layer (EGL) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Altman and Bayer, 1978</a>). In this layer, the progenitor cells proliferate extensively, and subsequently withdraw from the cell cycle and migrate toward the inner granule layer (IGL) to form the adult structure of the cerebellum. The precise control of the transition from proliferation to differentiation is key for regulating the final size of the cerebellum. The expansion of granule cell progenitors in the EGL is largely driven by sonic hedgehog (Shh) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dahmane et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wallace, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wechsler-Reya and Scott, 1999</a>). Disturbances in hedgehog signaling can lead to medulloblastoma, the most abundant type of pediatric tumor (<a href=\"#bib28\">Goodrich et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zhao et al., 2015</a>). Several mitogenic ligands for GCPs have been identified in addition to sonic hedgehog, including insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hartmann et al., 2005</a>) and Notch2 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hartmann et al., 2005</a>), however, little is known about factors that signal withdrawal from the cell cycle and initiation of differentiation. Since GCPs start migrating to the IGL as early as postnatal day (P) 4 and continue until P17-P20, this is a progressive process with waves of cells that exit the cell cycle and start to migrate, while others stay in the EGL and continue to proliferate (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hatten et al., 1997</a>), raising the question of what regulates the withdrawal of these progenitors from the cell cycle in the continued presence of Shh."

                        "text": "Neurotrophins are a family of growth factors, comprised of NGF, BDNF, NT-3 and NT-4, that regulate many aspects of neuronal development and function. Neurotrophins are synthesized as precursor proteins of approximately 35\u2009kDa that can either be cleaved to generate the mature factor, or secreted as the proneurotrophin (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lee et al., 2001</a>). Mature neurotrophins bind preferentially to Trk receptors to regulate neuronal survival and differentiation, while proneurotrophins preferentially interact with the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) in a complex with a member of the sortilin family (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nykjaer et al., 2004</a>). In the cerebellum, BDNF has been shown to regulate survival and migration of GCPs via the TrkB receptor (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schwartz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Borghesani et al., 2002</a>). Consistent with this role, TrkB is highly expressed throughout the EGL and IGL. In contrast, the p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptor is highly expressed in the EGL, but not the IGL (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carter et al., 2003</a>). The p75<sup>NTR</sup> can mediate many different functions depending on the cell context by binding to distinct co-receptors and recruiting specific intracellular binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barker, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</a>). The most well-characterized function for p75<sup>NTR</sup> is in promoting neuronal apoptosis following brain injury (<a href=\"#bib27\">Friedman, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and Simi, 2012</a>)."

As with other cellular functions, the regulation of proliferation by p75<sup>NTR</sup> is dependent on cellular context, this receptor has been shown to promote cell cycle entry in developing retinal and cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib44\">Morillo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">L\u00f3pez-S\u00e1nchez and Frade, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Frade and Ovejero-Benito, 2015</a>) and cell cycle exit of a variety of tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jin et al., 2007</a>) and glial cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cragnolini et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">2012</a>). However, a role for p75<sup>NTR</sup> in regulating cell cycle exit has not been previously demonstrated in neuronal progenitors in the developing brain. We show that the absence of p75<sup>NTR</sup> led to a delay in cell cycle exit of GCPs, indicating that p75<sup>NTR</sup> is necessary for timely withdrawal from the cell cycle. The lack of p75<sup>NTR</sup> was sufficient to increase the size of the cerebellum, a difference that persisted into adulthood, compromising the normal motor/balance function of these animals. In addition, we investigated the p75<sup>NTR</sup> ligands expressed in the cerebellum that elicited cell cycle arrest of GCPs, and demonstrate a specific role for proNT3 in blocking sonic hedgehog-induced proliferation."

The external EGL (eEGL) where cells express p75<sup>NTR</sup> and proliferation markers such as Ki67 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) and the internal EGL (iEGL) where p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression is downregulated, the cells stop proliferating\u00a0and express doublecortin (DCX) as they start the migratory process toward the IGL (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>).

To assess this, EdU was injected at P5, P7, P10, and P14. In wild type mice the age of maximal GCP proliferation in the EGL is at P5, compared to P7 in the rat. Low magnification images show the overview of the cerebellum with similar EdU incorporation in WT and <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice at P5, and the progressive decrease in EGL labeling in the WT beginning at P7, starting with the anterior lobes. EdU labeling remained high in the <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice at P7 and P10 and only began to decrease at P14 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). GCPs in lobe 6 were the last to leave the cell cycle, and incorporation of EdU into cells in the EGL of this region was quantified. EdU labeling remained elevated in the <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice compared with WT, with the difference most apparent at P10 and P14 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b,c</a>). To confirm these results, we compared expression of Ki67 in the EGL between wild type and <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice at different developmental ages. At early postnatal ages (P2-P5), during maximal proliferation, there was no difference in the number of cells that expressed Ki67 between WT and <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d,e</a>). However, at P7 in the EGL of WT mice, as cells began to withdraw from the cell cycle, there was a consequent reduction in the number of Ki67-positive cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). In contrast, this reduction was not observed in the <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice, where the number of proliferating cells remained high. As with EdU incorporation, this difference persisted and was even more evident at P10 and P14, when few proliferating GCPs remained in the EGL of WT mice. Cerebellar tissue taken from WT and <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice at different developmental ages also showed a clear difference in the level of cyclin E1 at P10 and P14 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>). These data indicated that the absence of p75<sup>NTR</sup> resulted in continued GCP proliferation in the EGL, and support a potential role for p75<sup>NTR</sup> in regulating the proper timing of cell cycle exit of GCPs."

As GCP proliferation decreased starting at P7 in WT mice, the level of HDAC1 was reduced in the EGL. However, the GCPs in the <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice continued proliferating, maintaining high levels of HDAC1, even at P14 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>). Not only were there more GCPs expressing HDAC1, consistent with more proliferating cells in the EGL of <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice, the intensity of HDAC1 expression was also higher in the knockout mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b,c</a>). To determine whether stimulation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> could regulate levels of HDAC1, cultured cerebellar granule cells were treated with Shh with or without proNT3. Shh induced HDAC1, as expected, however treatment with proNT3 eliminated the Shh-mediated induction of HDAC1 within one hour of treatment (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d,e</a>), indicating that activation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> was able to block a critical component of Shh signaling. HDAC1-mediated deacetylation of Gli2 is necessary for this transcription factor to translocate to the nucleus and induce Gli1 mRNA (<a href=\"#bib10\">Canettieri et al., 2010</a>), which leads to induction of additional genes needed to promote proliferation. Since proNT3 decreased levels of HDAC1, we investigated whether proNT3 also prevented induction of Gli1 mRNA by Shh. Cultured cerebellar neurons treated with Shh with or without proNT3 for 24\u2009hr were analyzed by qPCR for Gli1 mRNA, and showed that proNT3 reduced Gli1 mRNA induction by Shh (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8f</a>)."

Animals were tested the next day with the same time interval for test/recovery but with increasing speeds of 5\u2009rpm per trial until 40\u2009rpm was reached.

Of the neurotrophins, BDNF, NT3 and NT4 are highly expressed in the developing cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib24\">Friedman et al., 1998</a>). BDNF has been demonstrated to act via TrkB to maintain survival of GCPs and promote their migration to the IGL (<a href=\"#bib8\">Borghesani et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Minichiello and Klein, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhou et al., 2007</a>). Consistent with this function, TrkB is expressed throughout the EGL and IGL. NT3 also promotes survival of granule neurons and dendritic development of Purkinje cells via TrkC (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bates et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Joo et al., 2014</a>). However, whether proneurotrophins play a role in cerebellar development has not been extensively investigated. p75<sup>NTR</sup> is abundantly expressed in granule cells only in the EGL, specifically in the outer proliferative layer, which gets progressively smaller with development as the progenitors cease proliferating and migrate to the IGL. The p75<sup>NTR</sup> can bind many different ligands, associate with different co-receptors, and recruit a panoply of intracellular binding proteins to activate specific signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib12\">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Roux and Barker, 2002</a>), and therefore can influence multiple functions depending on the cellular context. The most well characterized effect mediated by p75<sup>NTR</sup> is cell death (<a href=\"#bib23\">Frade et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Friedman, 2000</a>), especially after injury such as that induced by seizures (<a href=\"#bib50\">Roux et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Troy et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Unsain et al., 2008</a>). However, during development, p75<sup>NTR</sup> is widely expressed in the brain (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yan and Johnson, 1988</a>), and is particularly abundant in the EGL of the cerebellum, where it does not mediate apoptosis. In the present work we demonstrate a novel function for p75<sup>NTR</sup>, showing that this receptor is necessary for proper cell cycle exit of GCPs in the cerebellum, and that proNT3 can antagonize Shh-induced proliferation of GCPs and promote cell cycle withdrawal."

                                "text": "Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a highly efficacious mitogen for GCPs and is vital for their clonal expansion within the EGL (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dahmane et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wechsler-Reya and Scott, 1999</a>). Shh continues to be expressed during cerebellar maturation, which raises the question of how some GCPs in the EGL stop responding to Shh and begin to migrate to the IGL while others keep proliferating. Previous studies have shown that P5-6 is the time of maximal GCP proliferation in mice (<a href=\"#bib48\">Roussel and Hatten, 2011</a>), and our results show that this coincides with the peak of p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression in the EGL. At this stage, almost all cells in the EGL were positive for both p75<sup>NTR</sup> and proliferation markers such as Ki67 and incorporation of EdU. After P7, two sublayers became apparent in the EGL. In the external zone, GCPs continued to proliferate and express p75<sup>NTR</sup>, while cells in the internal layer of the EGL no longer expressed p75<sup>NTR</sup> or proliferation markers as they began to differentiate and migrate tangentially in the medial-lateral plane (<a href=\"#bib39\">Legu\u00e9 et al., 2015</a>) and radially towards the IGL (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wang and Zoghbi, 2001</a>). In WT mice the number of proliferating GCPs in the EGL began to decrease at P7, and continued to decrease until few proliferating cells remained in the EGL at P14. In contrast, in both the global <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice and the mice specifically lacking p75<sup>NTR</sup> in the EGL (<i>Ngfr</i><sup>fl/fl</sup>:<i>Atoh1</i>-Cre mice), the number of proliferating, Ki67-positive cells remained elevated at P7, P10, and P14. However, the granule cells eventually ceased proliferating, and no tumors formed in these mice. These results suggest that there is a delay in cell cycle exit of GCPs lacking p75<sup>NTR</sup>, sufficient to cause an enlarged cerebellum that persisted into adulthood, and defects in motor coordination in these animals. Since no tumors formed in these mice and the GCPs in the <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice eventually stopped proliferating, it is likely that other anti-mitotic factors caused the cells to eventually leave the cell cycle. Several factors have been identified that promote cell cycle exit, including BMP2 and 4 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rios et al., 2004</a>), Wnt3 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anne et al., 2013</a>), and PACAP (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nicot et al., 2002</a>), each acting by a distinct mechanism to block Shh activation of the Gli transcription factors. However, despite the presence of these other factors, the specific absence of p75<sup>NTR</sup> caused the GCPs to continue proliferating beyond the usual developmental period, indicating that this receptor is important for the timing of cell cycle withdrawal. A question that remains to be addressed is whether the different anti-proliferative factors have redundant effects to ensure normal development of the cerebellum, or if each factor is necessary for maturation of different subpopulations of granule cells, all of them necessary for proper function. We observed that the expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> persisted the longest in lobes VIb, VII, and VIII, consistent with a previous study (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carter et al., 2003</a>) and in the same regions where we detected proliferation persisting the longest in the EGL, however the delay in cell cycle exit of GCPs in both the global <i>Ngfr</i>-/- and the <i>Ngfr</i><sup>fl/fl</sup>:Atoh-Cre mice was evident throughout the cerebellum."

Shh signals by regulating the Gli transcription factors, specifically activating Gli2, which then targets Gli1 for transcriptional induction (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blaess et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hui and Angers, 2011</a>). Gli1 and Gli2 are acetylated proteins, and their transcriptional activation requires deacetylation by HDAC1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Canettieri et al., 2010</a>), which is highly expressed in proliferating GCPs (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yoo et al., 2013</a>). HDAC1 is also required for deacetylation of histones, a crucial developmental regulatory event leading to condensation of chromatin and transcriptional repression, maintaining the cells in an immature, undifferentiated state (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dovey et al., 2010</a>). Previous studies have shown that HDAC activity is necessary for Shh-induced proliferation of cultured GCPs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lee et al., 2013</a>). Coincident with the continued proliferation of GCPs in the <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice, we observed that HDAC1 expression remained elevated in the EGL compared to the WT mice, where HDAC1 decreased as the cells ceased proliferating. We demonstrated that Shh induced HDAC1 in cultured GCPs and that this induction was reversed by proNT3. ProNT3 also attenuated the induction of Gli1 mRNA by Shh, suggesting a mechanism by which p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling may interfere with the Shh pathway by inhibiting HDAC1-mediated deacetylation of Gli2 to block Shh signaling, thereby promoting withdrawal from the cell cycle. Overexpression of Shh has previously been shown to result in an enlarged cerebellum due to overproduction of granule cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Corrales et al., 2004</a>). We have similarly observed an enlarged cerebellum in mice lacking p75<sup>NTR</sup> in the EGL, suggesting that removing this block of Shh signaling has a similar consequence as overexpression of Shh, resulting in the production of excess granule cells and an enlarged cerebellum."

                                "text": "In this study we demonstrated for the first time that proNT3 is a negative regulator of GCP proliferation, acting via p75<sup>NTR</sup>. NT3 expression has previously been detected in the developing cerebellum, however the mRNA was localized by in situ hybridization to granule cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lindholm et al., 1993</a>) and the protein has been localized to Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Friedman et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhou and Rush, 1994</a>). In this study we demonstrate that proNT3 protein is also present in Purkinje cells, and can be secreted as the uncleaved proneurotrophin. Mature neurotrophins had no effect on GCP proliferation. However, since all the proneurotrophins can activate p75<sup>NTR</sup> we expected that any proneurotrophin would reduce Shh-induced proliferation of GCPs. Surprisingly, proNGF and proBDNF had no effect on GCP proliferation, although they effectively promoted death of hippocampal neurons. Thus, proNT-3 proved to be the only neurotrophin to promote cell cycle exit in this neuronal population, suggesting that there is specificity among the different p75<sup>NTR</sup> ligands for their ability to influence distinct cellular functions. The basis for this specificity is unknown, however p75<sup>NTR</sup> has been shown to bind many different ligands to trigger distinct responses. Even the same ligand binding to p75<sup>NTR</sup> on the same cells may trigger different responses depending on the state of the cell. For example, NGF treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons initially promotes neurite outgrowth via p75<sup>NTR</sup> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brann et al., 1999</a>) but later promotes p75<sup>NTR</sup>-dependent neuronal death (<a href=\"#bib26\">Friedman, 2000</a>). Additionally, how the pro domains of proneurotrophins influence p75<sup>NTR</sup> activity is not understood. Recent studies showed that the pro domain of proBDNF induced LTD in hippocampal slices via a p75<sup>NTR</sup>-dependent mechanism, but the proNGF pro domain failed to do so (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mizui et al., 2015</a>). Additionally, the BDNF pro domain induced growth cone retraction, which required p75<sup>NTR</sup> even though the pro domain does not directly bind p75<sup>NTR</sup>, but rather binds to the co-receptor of the sortilin family, in this case SorCS2 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anastasia et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, the pro domain of proBDNF has a naturally occurring Val66Met polymorphism. Although both the Val66 and Met66 pro domains bound the SorCS2 receptor, only the Val66 pro domain induced growth cone collapse, the Met66 pro domain did not (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anastasia et al., 2013</a>), indicating that slight differences in the pro domain can lead to differences in functional outcome. Our current study also identified SorCS2 as the co-receptor for proNT3 actions on the GCP population, suggesting that the distinct pro domains of proneurotrophins differentially bind to the SorCS2 co-receptor and influence how p75<sup>NTR</sup> interacts with specific signaling pathways to regulate cellular responses, which may account for the specificity of proNT3 in regulating GCP cell cycle exit."

However, using the global <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice this observation may have been largely due to effects in Purkinje cells, which also express p75<sup>NTR</sup>, and knockout of p75<sup>NTR</sup> led to a worsening of Purkinje cell morphology seen with reduced BDNF levels (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carter et al., 2003</a>). The expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in Purkinje cells is not likely to play a role in cell cycle regulation since these cells are already postmitotic, an additional indication that the function of p75<sup>NTR</sup> depends on the cell context. That study also showed that p75<sup>NTR</sup> did not appear to play a role in apoptosis in the developing cerebellum, consistent with our findings."

Not surprisingly, therefore, the global <i>Ngfr</i>-/- mice performed poorly on the rotarod test. To ascertain whether the changes in the granule cell population resulting from the specific lack of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in the EGL had any consequence for motor function, floxed <i>Ngfr</i> mice were mated with the <i>Atoh1</i>-Cre mice to eliminate p75<sup>NTR</sup> from the EGL while retaining the receptor in Purkinje cells and other neuronal populations. These mice also demonstrated a significant delay in GCP cell cycle exit, a larger cerebellum, and a deficit in motor/balance function on the rotarod test. Although the deficit was not as severe as that seen with the global <i>Ngfr</i> knockout mice, these data indicate that the EGL-specific lack of p75<sup>NTR</sup> during development was sufficient to cause persistent loss of function into adulthood. Thus, the delayed withdrawal from the cell cycle resulting in expanded proliferation of GCPs are likely to have altered the ratio of granule cells to other neuronal populations, impacting the development of appropriate circuitry for motor function."

Antibodies used were: Ki67 (Abcam 15580, RRID:AB_443209, 1/500), anti-p75 (R&amp;D; AF367, RRID:AB_2152638, 1/500), anti-p75 (Millipore MAB365, RRID:AB_2152788, 1/1000), anti-proNT-3 (R&amp;D; AF3056, RRID:AB_2154250, 1/200), anti-NT-3 (R&amp;D; AF-267-NA, RRID:AB_354434, 1/200), anti-BrdU (Millipore 05\u2013633, RRID:AB_309861, 1/50). All secondary antibodies were diluted 1:1000, and incubated for 1\u00a0hr at RT. Nuclei were labeled with 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml Dapi/PBS for 1\u2009min at RT or 1\u00a0mM Draq5 (BioStatus DR-50200) for 30\u2009min and mounted using Prolong Gold (Life Technologies P36931). Controls for immunostaining included incubation with secondary antibodies in the absence of primary antibodies. The proNT3 antibody was tested for specificity on sections from <i>Ntf3</i>-/- mice compared to WT from P0 pups, since the <i>Ntf3</i> -/- mice die after birth."

The authors convincingly demonstrate that mutations in p75, either germ-line or restricted to the <i>Atoh1</i>- expressing granule cell lineage, cause persistent proliferation and delayed cell cycle exit of GCPs. Surprisingly only pro-NT3 and not the other pro-neurotrophins can stimulate p75 and regulate cell cycle exit in GCPs ex vivo. The data indicate that proNT3 functions to oppose Shh-induced proliferation. Overall the data are clear and convincing. The findings shed light on the functions of p75 and cerebellar development."

Zhou and Rush even commented on the fact that there was a mismatch with the mRNA being seen in granule cells and the protein in Purkinje cells. It is difficult to explain why the mRNA has been detected in granule cells and the protein in Purkinje cells, however we have now validated the antibodies used here by immunoprecipitation of NT3+/+, NT3+/- and NT3-/- mouse tissue, generously provided by Lino Tessarollo, using the anti-proNT3 antibody. Bands were seen only in the NT3+/+ and NT3+/- tissue, but not in the NT3-/- tissue, and the band was the same size as the proNT3 we produced from HEK cells for these studies. NT3 is expressed at very low levels in the developing brain, and since the NT3-/- mice die at birth we were only able to obtain P0 brains. Immunostaining was detected in the cingulate cortex of WT brains, as seen for NT3 mRNA by in situ hybridization (Friedman et al., J, Neurosci. 11:1577-1584, 1991) and NT3-LacZ reporter expression (Vigers et al., J. comp. Neurol. 416:398-415, 2000), but not NT3-/- brains. Additionally, the anti-proNT3 antibody was able to reverse the effect of proNT3 on GCP proliferation in vitro (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Therefore, we are confident that the proNT3 antibody specifically recognized proNT3. Future studies to resolve the source of the proNT3 to granule or Purkinje cells may be done with floxed NT3 mice crossed with the <i>Atoh1</i>-Cre, or a Purkinje cell Cre, but that is beyond the scope of the current study."
