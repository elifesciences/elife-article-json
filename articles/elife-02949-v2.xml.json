                    "text": "Prions are self-propagating protein aggregates that are characteristically transmissible. In mammals, the PrP protein can form a prion that causes the fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Prions have also been uncovered in fungi, where they act as heritable, protein-based genetic elements. We previously showed that the yeast prion protein Sup35 can access the prion conformation in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Here, we demonstrate that <i>E. coli</i> can propagate the Sup35 prion under conditions that do not permit its de novo formation. Furthermore, we show that propagation requires the disaggregase activity of the ClpB chaperone. Prion propagation in yeast requires Hsp104 (a ClpB ortholog), and prior studies have come to conflicting conclusions about ClpB's ability to participate in this process. Our demonstration of ClpB-dependent prion propagation in <i>E. coli</i> suggests that the cytoplasmic milieu in general and a molecular machine in particular are poised to support protein-based heredity in the bacterial domain of life."

In mammals, the PrP protein can form a prion that causes the fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Prions have also been uncovered in fungi, where they act as heritable, protein-based genetic elements. We previously showed that the yeast prion protein Sup35 can access the prion conformation in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Here, we demonstrate that <i>E. coli</i> can propagate the Sup35 prion under conditions that do not permit its de novo formation. Furthermore, we show that propagation requires the disaggregase activity of the ClpB chaperone. Prion propagation in yeast requires Hsp104 (a ClpB ortholog), and prior studies have come to conflicting conclusions about ClpB's ability to participate in this process. Our demonstration of ClpB-dependent prion propagation in <i>E. coli</i> suggests that the cytoplasmic milieu in general and a molecular machine in particular are poised to support protein-based heredity in the bacterial domain of life."

Although they are not living organisms, these prion aggregates can self-propagate; when they enter a healthy organism, they cause existing, correctly folded proteins to adopt the prion fold. Within the aggregate, the prion proteins have a corrugated structure that allows them to stack together tightly, which in turn makes the aggregates very stable. As more prions are formed, they then trigger other protein molecules to misfold and join the aggregates, and the aggregates continue to grow and spread within the infected organism causing tissue damage and cell death."

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (also commonly known as BSE or \u2018mad cow disease\u2019) is an example of a prion disease that affects cattle and can be transmitted to humans by eating infected meat. Prions also form in yeast and other fungi. These prions, however, do not cause disease or cell death; instead, yeast prions act as protein-based elements that can be inherited over multiple generations and which provide the yeast with new traits or characteristics. Although prions can form spontaneously in yeast cells, their stable propagation depends on so-called chaperone proteins that help to remodel the prion aggregates. Previous work has shown that bacterial cells can also support the formation of prion-like aggregates. The bacteria were engineered to produce two yeast prion proteins\u2014one of which spontaneously formed aggregates that were needed to trigger the conversion of the other to its prion form. However, it was not known if bacterial cells could support the stable propagation of prions if the initial trigger for prion conversion was removed."

This propagation depends on a bacterial chaperone protein called ClpB, which is related to another chaperone protein that is required for stable prion propagation in yeast. As such, the findings of Yuan et al. raise the possibility that, even though a prion specific to bacteria has yet to be identified, prions or prion-like proteins might also contribute to the diversity of traits found in bacteria. Furthermore, since both yeast and bacteria form and propagate prions in similar ways, such protein-based inheritance might have evolved in these organisms' common ancestor over two billion years ago."

Specifically, the prion form of a protein known as PrP is the causative agent of the TSEs, which afflicts humans and other mammals. Native PrP (PrP<sup>C</sup>) undergoes a dramatic change in conformation upon conversion to its prion form (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>), forming distinctive cross-\u03b2 aggregates termed as amyloid (<a href=\"#bib14\">Diaz-Espinoza and Soto, 2012</a>).

In general, such prion proteins exist in either a native, soluble form or a self-perpetuating, amyloid form with spontaneous conversion between forms representing a rare event (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lancaster et al., 2010</a>). However, unlike PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, yeast prions do not normally cause cell death. Instead, they can act as protein-based genetic elements that confer new phenotypes on those cells that harbor them (<a href=\"#bib62\">True and Lindquist, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tuite and Serio, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Newby and Lindquist, 2013</a>).

In the case of Sup35, the essential prion determinants, which include a glutamine- and asparagine-rich segment and five complete copies of an imperfect oligopeptide repeat sequence, lie in the N-terminal domain (N), whereas translation release activity resides in the C-terminal domain (C) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ter-Avanesyan et al., 1993</a>). A highly charged middle region (M) increases the solubility of native Sup35 and enhances the mitotic stability of [<i>PSI</i><sup>+</sup>] (<a href=\"#bib34\">Liu et al., 2002</a>). Together, Sup35 N and M function as a transferable prion-forming module (NM) that maintains its prionogenic potential when fused to heterologous proteins (<a href=\"#bib32\">Li and Lindquist, 2000</a>). A distinctive property of the Sup35 conversion process in yeast is its dependence on the presence of a pre-existing prion, designated [<i>PIN</i><sup>+</sup>] for [<i>PSI</i><sup>+</sup>] inducibility factor (<a href=\"#bib12\">Derkatch et al., 1997</a>). Thus, yeast strains containing Sup35 in the non-prion form, [<i>psi</i><sup>\u2013</sup>], support the spontaneous conversion to [<i>PSI</i><sup>+</sup>] only if they contain [<i>PIN</i><sup>+</sup>], typically the prion form of the Rnq1 protein (<a href=\"#bib11\">Derkatch et al., 2000</a>).

Specifically, the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp104 is strictly required for the propagation of virtually all yeast prions characterized thus far, and several other chaperone proteins have been implicated in this process as well (<a href=\"#bib33\">Liebman and Chernoff, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Winkler et al., 2012</a>). Various lines of evidence support the view that the essential role of Hsp104 with respect to prion propagation stems from its ability to fragment prion aggregates and thereby to generate smaller seed particles known as propagons that can be efficiently partitioned to daughter cells during cell division (<a href=\"#bib43\">Paushkin et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ness et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cox et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kryndushkin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Satpute-Krishnan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Higurashi et al., 2008</a>).

This [<i>PIN</i><sup>+</sup>] dependence provides an experimental framework for distinguishing between the initial conversion and subsequent propagation phases of the prion cycle. In particular, the formation of prion-like Sup35 NM aggregates can be induced in bacterial cells containing the New1 protein; subsequent depletion of the New1 protein from these cells reveals whether or not the bacterial cytoplasm can support the propagation of the Sup35 NM prion in the absence of [<i>PIN</i><sup>+</sup>]."

The striking parallel between the requirements for both prion formation and prion propagation in yeast and bacteria, which are thought to have diverged more than 2.2 billion years ago, suggests that the paradigm of protein-based heredity may be more ancient than previously inferred (<a href=\"#bib13\">DeSantis et al., 2012</a>)."

We note that the presence of SDS-stable Sup35 NM aggregates in experimental starter culture cells does not represent prion propagation because the presence of New1 (i.e., [<i>PIN</i><sup>+</sup>]) enables the continuing de novo conversion of newly synthesized Sup35 NM to the prion form."

Specifically, Hsp104 is thought to facilitate prion propagation by fragmenting large aggregates into smaller propagons that are subsequently disseminated during cell division (<a href=\"#bib43\">Paushkin et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ness et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cox et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kryndushkin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Satpute-Krishnan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Higurashi et al., 2008</a>). We therefore investigated whether or not the propagation of Sup35 NM aggregates in <i>E. coli</i> requires ClpB, the bacterial ortholog of Hsp104. To address this question, we sought to deplete cells of ClpB specifically during the propagation phase of our experiments. To accomplish this, we modified pSC101<sup>TS</sup>-<i>NEW1</i> such that it also directed the expression of <i>clpB</i> under the control of its native promoter. When transformed into \u0394<i>clpB</i> cells, pSC101<sup>TS</sup>-<i>NEW1</i>-<i>clpB</i> enabled us to grow starter cultures containing ClpB and subsequently to deplete both ClpB and New1 in cells plated at the non-permissive temperature (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

The disaggregase function of ClpB, which assembles as a two-tiered hexameric ring (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2003</a>), depends on its abilities to hydrolyze ATP, to translocate polypeptides through its central pore and to collaborate with DnaK (the bacterial Hsp70) and its co-chaperones DnaJ and the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib16\">Doyle and Wickner, 2009</a>). Accordingly, we tested previously characterized ClpB mutants specifically defective for (i) ATP hydrolysis (E279A/E678A) (<a href=\"#bib64\">Weibezahn et al., 2003</a>) (ii) substrate threading through the ClpB pore (Y653A) (<a href=\"#bib65\">Weibezahn et al., 2004</a>), and (iii) collaboration with DnaK (E432A) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Oguchi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Seyffer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3a\">Carroni et al., 2014</a>).

Based on an analysis of the in vivo activities of Hsp104/ClpB chimeras, Tipton et al. argue that prion replication in yeast requires that Hsp104 collaborate with its cognate Hsp70 chaperone system. A logical inference from their work is that the inability of ClpB to substitute for Hsp104 in supporting Sup35 prion propagation in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is an indirect consequence of the inability of ClpB to cooperate with fungal co-chaperones. More recently, Reidy et al. provided direct support for this inference. In particular, Reidy et al. found that ClpB supported prion propagation in yeast provided that DnaK and GrpE were present. Interestingly, the activity of the bacterial disaggregase machinery in yeast was dependent on the fungal Hsp40-family Sis1 protein, consistent with prior work implicating Sis1 as a necessary component of the chaperone network required for prion propagation in yeast (<a href=\"#bib26\">Higurashi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tipton et al., 2008</a>). Our work demonstrates that no exogenous fungal accessory factors are required for prion propagation in bacteria. Taken together, these observations argue that the amyloid remodeling activity of Hsp104 is an evolutionarily conserved feature of the Hsp100-family chaperones, an inference that is strongly supported by our finding that propagation of the Sup35 NM prion in <i>E. coli</i> requires ClpB disaggregase activity."

                                "text": "Despite the apparent prevalence of prions in the fungal kingdom, to date, no bacterial prion has been identified. Notably, the absence of cytoplasmic mixing during conjugation would preclude the discovery of prion-like phenomena by classic genetic approaches, which facilitated the discovery of prions in yeast based on the non-Mendelian inheritance of their associated phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cox, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aigle and Lacroute, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wickner, 1994</a>). Nevertheless, recent bioinformatic analyses of prokaryotic proteomes have revealed that bacterial and archaeal genomes encode many proteins containing glutamine- and asparagine-rich prion-like domains resembling those found in most confirmed and putative <i>S. cerevisiae</i> prions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alberti et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Espinosa Angarica et al., 2013</a>; Yuan et al., unpublished data). Moreover, it is becoming increasingly clear that Q/N-richness at the level of primary amino acid sequence is neither a prerequisite for prion conversion (<a href=\"#bib57\">Taneja et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Suzuki et al., 2012</a>) nor protein amyloidogenesis (<a href=\"#bib23\">Goldschmidt et al., 2010</a>). In fact, several bacteria utilize non-Q/N-rich amyloid-forming proteins to assemble extracellular appendages mediating surface attachment and biofilm formation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chapman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Romero et al., 2010</a>). These considerations\u2014in conjunction with the work presented here\u2014suggest that prions or prion-like proteins may exist as epigenetic reservoirs of phenotypic diversity in the bacterial domain of life."

This is dependent on the presence of both the yeast PIN factor New1 and the bacterial Hsp104 homologue ClpB. A PIN factor is required for conversion of Sup35 from psi- to PSI+ (the prion form) and Hsp104 has long been known to be required for the propagation of nearly all yeast prions known. Thus the key finding of this carefully done paper is that ClpB the E coli homologue of yeast Hsp104 is also analogous (having the same function). Since most homologues are analogues and many yeast proteins can function in <i>E. coli</i>, at one level this result is not too surprising. It does however suggest that fundamentally there are no huge differences between the cytosol of yeast and <i>E. coli</i> in regards to prion propagation apart from the presumable absence of PIN factors in <i>E. coli</i>. This work sets the stage for further genetic analysis of yeast prion propagation in <i>E. coli</i>."

The authors make a distinction between prion establishment and prion propagation, but these are really more tightly linked as one cannot establish a prion without propagating it. They do come out on the side of ClpB and New1 both being required for prion propagation but indeed since both were simultaneously depleted in the experiments shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, it seems more likely that they are both required for both the establishment and propagation phases. Even given the fuzziness of the distinction is not clear if ClpB is required for the propagation alone or if it is just required for prion establishment. Does expression of NM make <i>E. coli</i> sick? If it does then that raises the possibility that strains that propagate prions are able to sequester it as a less toxic form. This in combination with the observation that the vast majority of ClpB+ colonies fail to propagate NM raises the possibility that <i>E. coli</i> host mutations are also necessary for prion propagation and that <i>E. coli</i> is coming up with various other ways to get around this sickness. The various forms of aggregates observed raises the issue of which are prion-like and which are non-propagating. The real definition of prion I guess is ability to propagate, more than its SDS insolubility. This distinction should be made clearer throughout the manuscript."

(In demonstrating that ClpB is capable of remodeling prion-like aggregates, our findings complement those from the Masison lab, which we discuss; we note, however, that Masison and colleagues found that the ability of ClpB to support [PSI+] in yeast was dependent on the fungal Hsp40-family Sis1 protein, whereas our work shows that no fungal accessory factors are required in the endogenous bacterial setting.) Specifically, our results and those of the Masison lab challenge a prevalent view in the yeast prion field \u2013 namely that the ability to remodel prion-like aggregates is an Hsp104 innovation specific to fungal systems.

This is dependent on the presence of both the yeast PIN factor New1 and the bacterial Hsp104 homologue ClpB. A PIN factor is required for conversion of Sup35 from psi- to PSI+ (the prion form) and Hsp104 has long been known to be required for the propagation of nearly all yeast prions known. Thus the key finding of this carefully done paper is that ClpB the E coli homologue of yeast Hsp104 is also analogous (having the same function). Since most homologues are analogues and many yeast proteins can function in E. coli, at one level this result is not too surprising. It does however suggest that fundamentally there are no huge differences between the cytosol of yeast and E. coli in regards to prion propagation apart from the presumable absence of PIN factors in E. coli. This work sets the stage for further genetic analysis of yeast prion propagation in E. coli</i>."

The authors make a distinction between prion establishment and prion propagation, but these are really more tightly linked as one cannot establish a prion without propagating it. They do come out on the side of ClpB and New1 both being required for prion propagation but indeed since both were simultaneously depleted in the experiments shown in</i> <a href=\"#fig6\"><i>Figure 6</i></a><i>, it seems more likely that they are both required for both the establishment and propagation phases. Even given the fuzziness of the distinction is not clear if ClpB is required for the propagation alone or if it is just required for prion establishment. Does expression of NM make E. coli sick? If it does then that raises the possibility that strains that propagate prions are able to sequester it as a less toxic form. This in combination with the observation that the vast majority of ClpB+ colonies fail to propagate NM raises the possibility that E. coli host mutations are also necessary for prion propagation and that E. coli is coming up with various other ways to get around this sickness. The various forms of aggregates observed raises the issue of which are prion-like and which are non-propagating. The real definition of prion I guess is ability to propagate, more than its SDS insolubility. This distinction should be made clearer throughout the manuscript</i>."

                    "text": "The reviewer suggests that the distinction between prion establishment and prion propagation is a fuzzy one. We suspect that we did not make the distinction clear enough in our manuscript. We believe (i) that there is a clear conceptual distinction between the <i>de novo</i> formation phase and the propagation phase and (ii) that our <i>E. coli</i>-based system provides us with a rigorous experimental strategy to distinguish between these two phases. Conceptually, the <i>de novo</i> formation of prion-like aggregates from soluble protein within a given cell (which can be facilitated by protein overproduction) represents \u201cestablishment\u201d, whereas the maintenance of these aggregates in progeny cells under conditions that do not permit <i>de novo</i> formation represents \u201cpropagation\u201d. Accordingly, the strict [PIN+] dependence of Sup35-NM aggregate formation in our bacterial system allows for a clean separation between a <i>de novo</i> formation phase (which occurs in our \u201cstarter\u201d cultures) and a propagation phase (which occurs after plating). Specifically, the detection of prion-like aggregates in cells that have arisen multiple generations after the loss of the vector encoding New1 (the source of [PIN+] in our system) is evidence for propagation (i.e. protein-based inheritance)."

If ClpB were required just for prion establishment, then depleting the cells of ClpB <i>after</i> the establishment phase would not have resulted in Round-1 progeny clones that uniformly lack prion-like aggregates (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."
