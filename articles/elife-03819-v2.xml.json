Most importantly, whether any Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels have the capability to gate (open and close) as they diffuse laterally in the plasma membrane of a cell has not previously been addressed. It should be noted that the muscle nicotinic aceytylcholine receptors (AChR) expressed in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes have also been studied by optical recording, and the fluorescence signals emanating from these channels did not indicate channel clustering at the fluorescence sites (<a href=\"#bib11\">Demuro and Parker, 2005</a>).

The interaction of Orai channels with the ER-resident protein STIM1 reduces Orai mobility, acting as a sort of diffusion trap to localize Orai channels to these sites as well as directly gating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the Orai pore (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yeromin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wu et al., 2014</a>).

We took advantage of the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of TRPV1 to record Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets that reflected the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through open TRPV1 channels in response to capsaicin in isolated mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons and in immortalized mammalian cell lines. Whole-cell voltage clamp was used to both minimize the signal due to voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and to introduce a combination of fluorescent and nonfluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators. In contrast to L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, TRPV4 channels and AChR previously studied, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets from TRPV1 channels in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons and cultured cell lines were observed with a wide spectrum of mobilities, from immobile to near the diffusion coefficient of a lipid moving through a bilayer. To our knowledge, the opening and closing of a channel as it diffuses through the plasma membrane has not been previously observed. Using TRPV1 fused to GFP expressed in HEK293T/17 cells, we established that each sparklet represented the activity of one and only one TRPV1 channel. Remarkably, we found that the mobility of TRPV1, whether measured using sparklets or by tracking GFP-fused channels, decreased with activity in an extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. We propose that activity-dependent regulation of TRPV1 mobility could, like for Orai, lead to clustering of channels in regions of the cell where they are most needed."

In addition, new data from other channels indicates that mobility can be a powerful means by which cell function can be regulated. To examine this question, however, required implementation of new approaches that would allow activity and mobility to be measured in the same preparation and in primary sensory neurons."

TRPV1-expressing nociceptors were easily distinguished as the small-diameter (\u223c50 \u00b5m) cells in a 12\u201324 hr culture. As previously shown, these cells have large, capsaicin-activated currents when studied with whole-cell patch clamp as well as when studied using inside-out patch clamp (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stein et al., 2006</a>). The fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fluo-4 (200 \u03bcM) and the nonfluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator EGTA (10 mM) were included in the patch pipette, and cells were held at a potential of \u221240 mV. This potential was chosen empirically as the potential that minimized Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the absence of capsaicin. In addition to the EGTA included in the intracellular pipette solution, 1 \u03bcM thapsigargin was included in the bath solution to deplete the endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). These solutions allowed us to attribute the capsaicin-induced rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to influx through TRPV1 channels in the plasma membrane."

Sparklets were observed with physiological concentrations of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (2 mM). Out of 12 cells that responded to capsaicin and showed a rise in global fluorescence due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, nine cells had easily distinguished local micro-domains of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that we classified as sparklets."

All-points amplitude histograms of the fluorescence intensity revealed that sparklet-to-sparklet variability in amplitude of the capsaicin-induced fluorescence was low (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, this amplitude is likely determined primarily by the channel's relative position along the z-axis within the TIRF evanescent excitation field as well as the concentrations and properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers used. Thus, we did not interpret the stereotyped amplitude in terms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at the sparklet sites. Interestingly, the two-state intensity traces (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) resemble those of single-channel activity measured with electrophysiology (e.g., <a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rosenbaum et al., 2004</a>), albeit with lower temporal resolution. These data are consistent with each sparklet representing a single gating TRPV1 channel or a cluster of TRPV1 channels gating cooperatively. We distinguish between these possibilities below."

We compared these open probability values to those measured from the whole population of channels in these isolated dorsal root ganglion cells using whole-cell patch clamp. Examining the dose\u2013response relation for activation by capsaicin (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) shows that the current recorded in the presence of 100 nM capsaicin normalized to the current at a saturating capsaicin concentration was 0.84 \u00b1 0.05 (n = 4). This fractional activation value is slightly greater than the open probability values plotted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, for which the mean was 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 (N = 5). This small discrepancy is expected, because the open probability of TRPV1 in the presence of a saturating capsaicin concentration is somewhat less than 1.0 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2004</a>). These data indicate that the sensitivity of single TRPV1 channels as calculated from optical recordings of sparklets is similar to that of the cell population measured using whole-cell patch clamp."

To determine the mechanisms involved in controlling TRPV1 mobility we measured the sparklet trajectories, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, inset. Two factors, however, limited our ability to fully characterize these trajectories. The first factor, which is a general limitation of our approach in any cell type, was that our sparklet recording time was limited by the properties of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dye used. We required a dye sensitive enough to show the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through just a single channel. The appearance of individual sparklets when capsaicin was added became difficult to discern over time as the fluorescence across the cell footprint increased. The increase in fluorescence \u2018background\u2019 was due to the rapid, global increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> that occurs over the course of our experiments. Although the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator EGTA (10 mM) in our intracellular solution extended the useful recording time by acting as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sink, a rise in global Ca<sup>2+</sup> due to continued influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through TRPV1 ultimately obscured the sparklet signals once intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels exceeded the upper limit of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive dye's optimal range (Fluo-4: 1 \u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup>; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)."

These tube-like structures were observed even when the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin was present (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), indicating that they are likely neurite-like processes underneath the cell footprint, rather than endoplasmic reticulum within the cell body. The processes hampered further characterization of capsaicin-activated sparklet activity in isolated dorsal root ganglion cells because in the confined space of the processes, global Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels dominate sparklet signals very rapidly (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). We attempted to circumvent this issue by conducting experiments very soon after cell isolation, before processes could form. However, cells studied soon after isolation, before significant processes had formed, showed footprints that were irregularly-adhered to the coverglass, and thus were not evenly within the evanescent TIRF field. Transient transfection of TRPV1 into the F11 cell line, a hybridoma formed between dorsal root ganglion cells and neuroblastoma cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stein et al., 2006</a>), were examined as an alternative to primary cell culture. In experiments using the F11 line with the channel expressed as a fluorescent fusion protein, TRPV1-tagRFP, we did observe moving sparklets (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). However, processes running under the footprint of F11 cells (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>) interfered with sparklet characterization as they did in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons. To study sparklet mobility we therefore turned to expressing tagRFP- and GFP-tagged TRPV1 (TRPV1-tagRFP and TRPV1-GFP) in transiently transfected HEK293T/17 cells, in which the neurite-like processes were not observed."

Sparklets were not observed in the absence of capsaicin nor in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a> (see also <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>), fluorescence from capsaicin-activated sparklets in HEK293T/17 cells had the signature two-amplitude intensities also observed in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For these experiments we used Fluo-5F (200 \u03bcM) together with 10 mM EGTA in the pipette solution and 20 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the extracellular buffer to closely mimic the experiments of <a href=\"#bib28\">Navedo et al. (2005)</a>, who report on immobile sparklets from L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Interestingly, the amplitude of fluorescence intensity in the sparklets was comparable in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons and HEK293T/17 cells (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). However, differences in the dye (Fluo-5F vs Fluo-4) and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (20 mM vs 2 mM) make it difficult to draw any conclusions from this similarity. The open probability for sparklets in HEK293T/17 cells was significantly less than for sparklets in isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This difference is consistent with the higher K<sub>1/2</sub> for activation of TRPV1 expressed in HEK293T/17 cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collins and Gordon, 2013</a>). Interestingly, capsaicin-independent increases in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> were observed in untransfected as well as TRPV1-transfected HEK293T/17 cells. These could be easily distinguished from sparklets due to TRPV1 as their open times were very brief and their amplitude was spikey (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), rather than showing two states like TRPV1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). These TRPV1-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were excluded from the analysis reported here."

To test this hypothesis, we used photobleaching to count the number of subunits per feature, using GFP instead of tagRFP due to its superior spectroscopic properties and because we did not need to avoid spectral overlap with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dye in these experiments. TRPV1 is a homomeric tetramer structurally similar to the voltage-gated superfamily of ion channels that includes voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liao et al., 2013</a>). Each TRPV1-GFP channel should thus have four copies of GFP per functional channel. If each fluorescent spot represents one TRPV1-GFP channel, four photobleaching steps should be observed. However, if each spot represents several TRPV1-GFP channels, &gt;4 photobleaching steps should be observed. Because measuring the GFP fluorescence intensity of mobile TRPV1 channels proved difficult, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were used in these photobleaching experiments."

We observed from one to four photobleaching steps across the population of TRPV1-GFP and plotted a histogram of the steps (total number of sites with bleaching steps = 384), shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>. We then fitted the data with a binomial model given a fixed number of subunits, <i>n</i>, and the probability that each GFP monomer was able to fluoresce at the time the sample was first illuminated, <i>p</i>, as a free parameter (see \u2018Material and methods\u2019). The best fit was obtained using <i>n</i> = 4 and p = 0.45 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), and fits with n = 5, as would be the case if TRPV1 were pentameric, or n = 8, if TRPV1 tetrameric channels formed pairs, were both rejected by \u03c7<sup>2</sup> goodness-of-fit tests (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and legend). Although p = 0.45 produced by the fit with <i>n</i> = 4 is low with respect to this value reported by others (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ji et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>), our experiments were performed in fixed cells, a preparation known to partially disrupt fluorescent protein fluorescence (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chalfie and Kain, 1998</a>).

To further understand mechanisms underlying the spectrum of sparklet mobilities we observed, we performed a large survey of TRPV1-GFP mobilities by tracking diffusion of the channels in the plasma membrane. We acquired 15 s videos of TRPV1-GFP channels moving laterally in the plasma membrane of living cells and used the particle tracking algorithm u-track, which simplifies tracking of features in a large sample size and minimizes user bias in track identification (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jaqaman et al., 2008</a>), to follow channel movements. Channel trajectories for the first 6 s of a video are shown projected onto the last fluorescent image of the cell in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> (see <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). The mean squared displacements (MSD) of selected tracks labeled as 1, 2, and 3 are presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>. Each of the three tracks exhibited a different MSD vs time slope, which was characterized by an effective diffusion coefficient, D<sub>eff</sub>, as a measure of mobility. These data were then used to generate a histogram of effective diffusion coefficients for all the TRPV1-GFP channel tracks observed in the full 15 s video (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The large variability in channel mobilities, with a 20-fold range of D<sub>eff</sub> (0.01\u20130.5 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s), is consistent with a heterogeneous population within any given cell. Interestingly, the distribution of mobilities between cells also varied, but only by about a factor of two (mean D<sub>eff</sub> range: 0.029 to 0.056 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We used circles representing the size of the uncertainty (1/10<sup>th</sup> scale) to indicate both which points were observed as sparklets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, cyan circles) and which as GFP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, red circles). The uncertainty for all the points (GFP and sparklet) ranged from 0.13 \u03bcm to 0.33 \u03bcm, allowing us to determine the positions of the fluorescent feature along the full track length. Two interpretations of these data stand out. First, the co-localization between TRPV1-GFP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, red circles) and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, cyan circles) confirmed that mobile sparklets co-diffuse with mobile TRPV1-GFP channels. Second, the higher fluorescence intensity of sparklets compared to TRPV1-GFP did not impede our ability to localize sparklets as compared to TRPV1-GFP. The simplest interpretation of our data is that sparklets represent Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through the labeled TRPV1-GFP as it gates. The mobility of actively gating TRPV1 is somewhat surprising, as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets from TRPV4 were previously reported to be immobile (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mercado et al., 2014</a>) as have sparklets attributed to L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib28\">Navedo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Navedo et al., 2006</a>) and AchR channels (<a href=\"#bib11\">Demuro and Parker, 2005</a>). In addition, in a search of the literature we did not find any reports of simultaneous observations of ion channel activity and mobility in living cells. However, the mobility of capsaicin-activated TRPV1 sparklets in three different cell types (isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons, F11 cells, and HEK293T/17 cells) raises the question of whether the mobility of other types of active channels should be reexamined."

The decreased mobility of these sparklets is illustrated by the trajectory shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> (top). The red, blue, and green segments of the track represent the location of the sparklet during three consecutive epochs of equal duration. The first, red epoch was one of high mobility. The second and third epochs, represented in blue and green, respectively, showed markedly reduced mobility. Plotting the displacements as a function of time for this track (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> bottom), fitting it with a line, and calculating its slope was used to measure the trend in this track toward reduced mobility. One of the three sparklets that showed increased mobility upon activation is shown in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The slopes of the lines from the 16 sparklets are shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, revealing a trend towards decreasing mobility (negative slope; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

Sparklets have been used previously by Navedo et al. to report on the gating of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels as single channels or in clusters of up to seven channels (<a href=\"#bib28\">Navedo et al., 2005</a>), or assemblies of TRPV4 channels in arterial myocytes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mercado et al., 2014</a>). The immobile TRPV1-tagRFP sparklets allowed us to measure the fluorescence intensity of capsaicin-induced sparklets and determine the number of channels at each sparklet site. The two-state fluorescence signature of the TRPV1-tagRFP sparklets could arise from single-channel openings or from multiple channels at each sparklet site with very high gating cooperativity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Analysis of the photobleaching steps attributed to TRPV1-GFP channels in fixed HEK293T/17 cells provided further confirmation that the channel assembles as a tetramer of TRPV1-GFP subunits without forming higher order oligomeric assemblies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Importantly, laterally mobile TRPV1-GFP in live cells could be tracked via both their fluorescent protein label and their sparklet activity, and switching from a lower fluorescence emission of the fluorescent protein label to the higher intensity sparklet fluorescence within the same feature demonstrated that the mobile sparklets emanated from mobile TRPV1-GFP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a> and <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). Together, these data indicate that each capsaicin-induced sparklet is due to the activation of one, and only one, TRPV1 ion channel. This doesn't preclude higher number assemblies from forming, but these were never observed in our transiently transfected cells. Our data on dorsal root ganglion sparklets activated by capsaicin recapitulates our observations in TRPV1-GFP and TRPV1-tagRFP expressing HEK293T/17 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

However, our finding that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is required for the capsaicin-induced decrease in TRPV1 mobility may hint at the mechanism by which the change in mobility occurs. Changes in the cytoskeleton upon upregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive effectors such as \u03b1-actinin, gelsolin or scinderin (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rodriguez Del Castillo et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Witke et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kinosian et al., 1998</a>) can be easily imagined to regulate membrane protein mobility. The formation of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> domains has previously been linked to regulation of cell architecture and remodeling of the cytoskeleton. A recent study looking at the influence of TRPM7 elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> micro-domains in migrating fibroblasts identified this process as part of the mechanism by which the cell steers towards a chemoattractant (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wei et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">2012</a>). Thus, the involvement of cytoskeleton in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx mediated regulation of TRPV1 mobility is a subject of interest for future studies."

These interactions are likely related to a physiological response facilitated by nerve growth factor (NGF) that increases cell surface expression of TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zhang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Stein et al., 2006</a>). Biochemical and electrophysiological experiments also point to a complex formed between AKAP79/150 and TRPV1 to alter sensitization of TRPV1 in response to inflammatory agents (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Por et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Efendiev et al., 2013</a>). Differential properties of a signaling complex involving TRPV1 could be determined by the mobility of the channel, which makes its activity dependent mobility a point of interest. One can imagine that the activity of TRPV1 will confine the channel to a specific region of the cell, where it may (or may not) be more likely to encounter its binding partners in the PI3-kinase/ TrkA receptor complex. It is further possible that the binding of TRPV1 to a complex with a consequent change to the channel's mobility also feeds back on its function."

Perhaps decreased mobility in regions of locally elevated channel activity serves as a sort of diffusion trap, concentrating TRPV1 channels in parts of the cell where they are most needed. Sensory neurons with cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia are not very polarized (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dubin and Patapoutian, 2010</a>). Indeed, in culture without other types of neurons they do not form synapses; in their role as sensory receptors they are not postsynaptic to other cells types and appear to have lost the signaling required to form postsynaptic structures. Other mechanisms for protein targeting might thus be prominent in these types of cells."

                        "text": "In preparation for analyzing sparklet intensity and movement observed in endogenous TRPV1, TRPV1-tagRFP and TRPV1-GFP expressing cells, we first normalized TRPV1 sparklet signal to an average from images acquired before sparklets were observed, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib11\">Demuro and Parker, 2005</a>). In the case of immobile sparklet intensity analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A and 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), all points histograms of the normalized intensity were generated in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), with baseline subtraction to account for rising global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in background and (\u0394F/F<sub>0</sub>) collected in a 12 \u00d7 12 (6 \u00d7 6 for dorsal root ganglion neuron experiments) pixel region-of-interest (ROI) centered on each sparklet. In the case of sparklet movement analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B, 5, 7</a>) five frames were averaged in time with the frequency cut-off set to 0.1 using the Windowed-sinc filter plug-in (ImageJ). Tracking of individual sparklets was then semi-autonomously performed with the ImageJ Spot Tracker 2D plug-in (<a href=\"http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/spottracker/\">http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/spottracker/</a>). In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, the TRPV1-GFP fluorescent feature was tracked at an early stage of sparklet activity so that longer segments of the track represented contiguous positions of the GFP fluorescence followed by segments of sparklet fluorescence. Spot Tracker 2D does not provide the uncertainty for each position in the track, and we wished to compare the precision in measuring sparklet to GFP single molecule positions. We used Matlab (<a href=\"http://www.mathworks.com/\">www.Mathworks.com</a>) to calculate the standard deviations (x- and y-direction) of a 2D bivariate Gaussian function fit to an ROI centered on each fluoroescent peak recovered by ImageJ Spot Tracker 2D (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schmidt et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cheezum et al., 2001</a>). A bivariate Gaussian was used because time averaging of the frames could stretch the feature by a small degree, and the uncertainty for the precision was calculated as the average of the two standard deviations. The region we ascribed to the feature (5 \u00d7 5 pixels) was chosen as a compromise between isolating the feature of interest from surrounding unrelated signals and recovering the full shape of the GFP or sparklet feature. As TRPV1 channels opened, the background fluorescence levels gradually increased during the course of the video. Although most single particle detection methods rely on a background offset in their fitting function to accommodate a slowly varying and evenly distributed background level, we found that the highly variable and changing background levels of sparklet videos necessitated a background subtraction and additional fitting constraints in the tails of the 2D Gaussian fit. To suppress any effect that the background fluorescence had on our fits, an additional two layers of pixels surrounding the 5 \u00d7 5 pixel region were used to calculate a mean background level. This mean background was subtracted from the pixels in our 5 \u00d7 5 feature region, and the two layers of pixels were padded onto our feature region as zero-valued to extend the total fitted ROI to a 9 \u00d7 9 region. In <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, tracks were selected based on their contiguous sparklet fluorescence signals for ease of tracking. Fluorescence from GFP was not observed in the course of these videos due to the high background fluorescence (for example, see <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). This allowed us to pool displacement data from TRPV1-GFP and TRPV1-tagRFP in our analysis. Displacements of sparklet positions in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> were determined for time points that are 10 steps apart (i.e., frame <i>i</i> to <i>i</i> + 10) to: 1) minimize the random noise contribution and 2) have greater confidence in the precision of the displacement calculation."

The number of tracks contributing to each average MSD in a video ranged from \u223c80-600. The MSD difference ratio (R<sub>\u0394MSD</sub>) reduced the impact of photobleaching on a particular cell by normalizing to the MSD measured in the first part of each video (see <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The only difference is that they held at \u201340 mV (compared to \u201370 mV for L\u2013type sparklets). They argued that this was so \u201cto minimize the activity of voltage\u2013gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels while also limiting the driving force of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cell, which would reduce the duration of our experiments as the global rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> obscures the signal due to single TRPV1\u201d.

Also \u201340 mV does not minimize the driving force when the calcium equilibrium potential is +120 mV. In addition, the 10 mM EGTA should be capable of buffering global changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Furthermore, these recordings represent the first measurements of TRPV1 sparklets, and therefore a number of criteria should be fulfilled, e.g., quantal levels should depend on the calcium electrochemical gradient and not on the nature of the agonist or antagonist.

These algorithms work well with single fluorescent particles due to the high signal\u2013to\u2013noise ratio between the particle and the surrounding environment (i.e., small standard deviation of the 2D Gaussian fit that equal the relative size of the particle). Like any statistical analysis, the smaller the variability, the higher the confidence in the calculated mean value, or in this case the 2D location of the particle. Attempts to apply these methods of analysis to larger more variable and dynamic \u201cparticle\u201d like Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events would be extremely difficult. The relative size, or spatial spread of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, would increase the standard deviation of the 2D Gaussian fit, and therefore decrease the confidence of the location of the particle.

However, with extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 2 mM, the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV1 will continue to saturate available EGTA and a Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient will form between the plasma membrane (where we collect our signal in TIRF) and the opening of the pipette (where Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound EGTA diffuses out of the cell as Ca<sup>2+</sup> \u2013free EGTA diffuses in). This increases the free Ca<sup>2+</sup> available to bind Fluo\u20134 or Fluo-5F, making it harder to resolve additional sparklets. In response to the reviewer\u2019s question about quantal level, we now show collected data for sparklets from both dorsal root ganglion neurons and HEK293T/17 cells in new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>. The results of this analysis surprised us, because we expected the uneven position of the bilayer in the evanescent field would produce more variability than observed.
