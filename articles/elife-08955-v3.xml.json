                    "text": "HIV encodes Tat, a small protein that facilitates viral transcription by binding an RNA structure (<i>trans</i>-activating RNA [TAR]) formed on nascent viral pre-messenger RNAs. Besides this well-characterized mechanism, Tat appears to modulate cellular transcription, but the target genes and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We report here that Tat uses unexpected regulatory mechanisms to reprogram target immune cells to promote viral replication and rewire pathways beneficial for the virus. Tat functions through master transcriptional regulators bound at promoters and enhancers, rather than through cellular \u2018TAR-like\u2019 motifs, to both activate and repress gene sets sharing common functional annotations. Despite the complexity of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in the cell, Tat precisely controls RNA polymerase II recruitment and pause release to fine-tune the initiation and elongation steps in target genes. We propose that a virus with a limited coding capacity has optimized its genome by evolving a small but \u2018multitasking\u2019 protein to simultaneously control viral and cellular transcription."

Besides this well-characterized mechanism, Tat appears to modulate cellular transcription, but the target genes and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We report here that Tat uses unexpected regulatory mechanisms to reprogram target immune cells to promote viral replication and rewire pathways beneficial for the virus. Tat functions through master transcriptional regulators bound at promoters and enhancers, rather than through cellular \u2018TAR-like\u2019 motifs, to both activate and repress gene sets sharing common functional annotations. Despite the complexity of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in the cell, Tat precisely controls RNA polymerase II recruitment and pause release to fine-tune the initiation and elongation steps in target genes. We propose that a virus with a limited coding capacity has optimized its genome by evolving a small but \u2018multitasking\u2019 protein to simultaneously control viral and cellular transcription."

A small protein encoded by the virus, called Tat, boosts the expression of HIV genes in infected immune cells by binding to a structure that forms on newly synthesized viral RNAs. Recent evidence suggests that HIV also changes the expression of human genes to make immune cells more hospitable to the virus. However, it was not known exactly which specific genes are targeted, or how the virus alters their expression."

Rather than bind to the same structure seen in newly forming HIV RNAs, Tat turns on or off the expression of its human target genes by interacting with proteins that regulate human gene expression. In doing so, Tat is able to precisely control the activity of an enzyme called RNA Polymerase II that is necessary for the early steps of gene expression."

The work of Reeder, Kwak et al. suggests that Tat reshapes the human genome to position target genes in ways that allow them to be efficiently turned on or off. Future studies will further reveal how Tat accomplishes this genome remodeling during different stages of infection. In addition, further research is also necessary to look closely into the sets of genes targeted by Tat to find patterns of genes that work together to alter cell behavior, and investigate how these new behaviors allow HIV to thrive."

Transcription factors coordinate the activation and/or repression of key regulatory programs by acting at one or multiple steps in this regulatory circuitry. While one group of transcription factors recruit Pol II to their target genes to induce transcription initiation, another class functions by promoting the transcriptional pause release from the promoter-proximal state to allow Pol II transition to the productive elongation phase (<a href=\"#bib20\">Feinberg et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gomes et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Peterlin and Price, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Rahl et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>). Thus, promoter-proximal pausing has been identified as a general feature of transcription control by Pol II in metazoan cells and a key regulatory step during differentiation, cell development and induction of stem cell pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman and Lis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Core and Lis, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Smith and Shilatifard, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "In addition to Pol II and the basal transcription machinery, the epigenetic landscape plays another critical role in transcription regulation, mediated by covalent modifications to the N-terminal tails of histones. The study of chromatin modifications has revealed fundamental concepts in the regulation of transcription. Histone marks, in general, associate with different genomic domains (promoters, coding units and enhancers) and provide evidence of their transcriptional status (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barski et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Creyghton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Guenther et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Li et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Tessarz and Kouzarides, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>). While active promoters are marked with histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), active transcription units are marked with H3K79me3 and H3K36me3 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Kouzarides, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Li et al., 2007</a>). Thus, most Pol II regulated genes (protein-coding and long non-coding RNAs) contain a K4/K36 signature that positively correlates with active gene expression (<a href=\"#bib30\">Guttman and Rinn, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Martin and Zhang, 2005</a>). In addition to promoters, distal genomic elements referred to as enhancers modulate gene activity through gene looping or long-range chromatin interactions and further regulate the location, timing, and levels of gene expression (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bulger and Groudine, 2011</a>). The genomic locations of these enhancers (inter- or intra-genic) usually correlate with high H3K4me1 and low H3K4me3 content and their activity is proportional to the levels of H3K27Ac (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bulger and Groudine, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Creyghton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Kim et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Kowalczyk et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Smallwood and Ren, 2013</a>). Additionally, H3K27Ac also appears to modulate two temporally separate events: it enhances the search kinetics of transcriptional activators and accelerates the transition from initiation into elongation leading to a robust and potentially tunable transcriptional response (<a href=\"#bib102\">Stasevich et al., 2014</a>)."

In addition to sustaining transcription of their own genomes, certain viral transcription factors directly or indirectly alter existing cellular programs in ways that promote viral processes (replication and spread) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ferrari et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Horwitz et al., 2008</a>) and/or modulate programs in the infected target cell. It is well established that the HIV Tat protein relieves promoter-proximal pausing at the viral promoter by recruiting the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to the <i>trans</i>-activating RNA (TAR) stem-loop formed at the 5\u2019-end of viral nascent pre-mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib15\">D'Orso and Frankel, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Mancebo et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Ott et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib112\">Zhu et al., 1997</a>). Recently, it was discovered that Tat recruits P-TEFb as part of a larger complex referred to as super elongation complex (SEC), which is composed by the MLL-fusion partners involved in leukemia (AF9, AFF4, AFF1, ENL, and ELL), and PAF1. Although SEC formation relies on P-TEFb, optimal P-TEFb kinase activity towards the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) is AF9 dependent, and the MLL-fusion partners and PAF1 are required for Tat transactivation (<a href=\"#bib35\">He et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Luo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Sobhian et al., 2010</a>)."

One example of Tat-mediated down-regulation is the mannose receptor in macrophages and immature dendritic cells, which plays a key role in host defense against pathogens by mediating their internalization (<a href=\"#bib10\">Caldwell et al., 2000</a>). A similar case is Tat\u2019s repression of the MHC class I gene promoter, which depends on Tat binding to complexes containing the TBP-associated factor TAFII250/TAF1 (<a href=\"#bib107\">Weissman et al., 1998</a>). The interaction of the C-terminal domain of\u00a0Tat\u00a0and TAF1 suggests that Tat mediates repression functions through the transcription initiation complex. These, and many other examples, suggest that Tat is capable of altering cellular gene expression via association with factors bound to promoters."

While these previous studies have provided early glimpses about Tat recruitment to host cell chromatin, a comprehensive description of the direct target genes and the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address those gaps in knowledge, we aimed at: (i) identifying Tat target genes in the human genome, (ii) delineating the molecular mechanisms by which Tat reprograms cellular transcription, and (iii) defining how Tat is recruited to host cell chromatin. One of the main challenges in the field is to obtain a high-quality, comprehensive ChIP-seq that will provide functional insights. To address this challenge, we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of Tat in the human genome using a technically improved ChIP-seq compared to the previous studies. Moreover, we investigated the molecular mechanisms using a global analysis of chromatin signatures that demarcate the position and activity of genomic domains (enhancers, promoters and coding units), as well as Pol II recruitment and activity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barski et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Creyghton et al., 2010</a>). We provide, for the first time, evidence that the direct Tat target genes share functional annotations and are regulated by common master transcriptional regulators such as T-cell identity factors. While the Tat stimulated genes (TSG) show a positive role in activating T cells, favoring cell proliferation to promote viral replication and spread, the Tat down-regulated genes (TDG) show critical roles in blunting immune system responses, nucleic acid biogenesis (splicing and translation), and proteasome control. Strikingly, Tat functions as both activator and repressor by modulating Pol II recruitment and/or pause release as well as controlling the activity of chromatin-modifying enzymes to reprogram the epigenetic landscape of the host cell."

We provide the molecular basis of an unprecedented paradigm with critical roles in host-pathogen interactions."

However, the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. To elucidate how Tat performs these functions we aimed at: (i) identifying genomic domains occupied and regulated by Tat in the human genome, and (ii) defining the mechanisms of transcriptional control. We generated high-quality chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP)-seq datasets in two Jurkat CD4+ T cell lines, inducibly expressing FLAG-tagged Tat or green fluorescent protein (GFP) used as negative control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Importantly, the cell line used expresses low and physiologic levels of Tat, which mimic those detected during HIV infection (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We utilized this minimalistic system in order to more precisely examine the effects of Tat alone rather than in an infection setting. The latter approach may compromise the investigation due to the introduction of other viral products that may also affect cellular behavior and/or alter Tat activity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Frankel and Young, 1998</a>)."

We identified genomic domains enriched with statistically significant occupancy relative to input DNA using the model-based analysis of ChIP-seq (MACS) algorithm with a stringent cutoff (FDR&lt;0.05) (<a href=\"#bib109\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Unexpectedly, we did not find a significant number of overlapping peaks between the Tat and FLAG\u00a0ChIP-seq datasets, suggesting that the Tat Ab performs poorly in ChIP, providing a molecular explanation for the low-quality dataset generated by Marban et al. (<a href=\"#bib73\">Marban et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013E</a>). We thus focused on FLAG, which enabled us to generate a better quality, more comprehensive ChIP-seq dataset compared with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kim et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Marban et al., 2011</a>), which served as the key basis to elucidate novel Tat functions in the control of cellular transcription. To precisely map Tat binding sites in the human genome, we called FLAG peaks in both the Tat and GFP cell lines, then discarded those peaks in the intersection of both datasets, considering only the FLAG peaks unique to the Tat cell line to be true Tat binding events. We found that the majority of FLAG peaks in the Tat cell line represent bona fide Tat binding sites because they are not detected in the GFP cell line (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,C\u2013E</a>). Importantly, the ChIP signal for FLAG was barely detectable in the GFP cell line or in cells expressing inactivating Tat mutations in the activation domain (such as C22A) that abolish Tat recruitment to target genes and/or impair gene expression activation (<a href=\"#bib16\">D'Orso et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Another controller node assembles the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) serine/threonine kinase, which is best known for its role as an activator of the DNA damage response (HIV infection cluster). The activity of HIV integrase stimulates an ATM-dependent DNA damage response, and ATM deficiency sensitizes cells to retrovirus-induced cell death. In addition, ATM inhibition is capable of suppressing the replication of both wild-type and drug-resistant HIV (<a href=\"#bib64\">Lau et al., 2005</a>), thus demonstrating the importance of this TSG in controlling viral processes. With respect to down-regulated processes, ribosomal proteins centered around RPS9 (ribosome cluster), together with translation initiation factors (EIF3b) and the nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein NOLC1, as well as components of the spliceosome such as SF3B5, SNRPB, SNRNP200, LSM4, and PCBP2 (spliceosome cluster), suggest negative regulation of these processes (<a href=\"#fig1s9\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 9</a>)."

The prime example of pathways enriched in TSG is T-cell signaling/activation and co-stimulatory signals (CD28) that provide additional control mechanisms to prevent inappropriate and hazardous T-cell activation. The data is consistent with the fact that, in early stages of infection, the viral encoded proteins (particularly Tat) mimic T-cell signaling pathways, resulting in sustained viral replication within infected T cells. This T-cell activation provides new targets for HIV replication, creating a favorable environment for further virus-mediated damage to the immune system and chronic consumption of the pools of na\u00efve and resting memory cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hazenberg et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hellerstein et al., 2003</a>).

To investigate whether Tat acts at the initiation or elongation steps, we performed ChIP-seq of several histone modifications (in the absence and presence of Tat) that demarcate distinct genomic domains such as promoters, coding units and enhancers and provide (in general) information regarding their transcriptional status (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

Thus, we first determined the levels of H3K4me3 in both cell lines to test whether Tat modulates transcription initiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). After fixing TSS selection for a subset of TSG such as <i>ADCYAP1</i> and <i>ARHGEF7</i>, where transcription starts at a short, internal isoform (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), we observed that the majority of TSG (excluding <i>ATP9A, CD244, ADCYAP1, CD226, SERINC2</i>) are already marked with variable (low-to-high) H3K4me3 levels and, as expected, its distribution mirrors the location of the promoter-adjacent nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We thus defined two groups of genes based on H3K4me3 fold change levels in the presence and absence of Tat (Tat/GFP). While the first group of genes (n = 17), referred to as class I TSG, has undetectable or low H3K4me3 levels in the absence of Tat (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>), the second group of genes, referred to as class II TSG, shows medium-to-high H3K4me3 levels surrounding the TSS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>)."

Previous studies have elucidated that in actively transcribed genes, H3K79me2/3-modified nucleosomes are present at their highest levels shortly downstream of the TSS and that H3K36me3 modifications occupy the entire gene body, with increasing density towards the 3\u2019-end of the gene (<a href=\"#bib29\">Guenther et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Kolasinska-Zwierz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Li et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Seila et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>). To examine transcription states in detail, we carried out ChIP-seq experiments of H3K79me3 and H3K36me3 using validated antibodies (<a href=\"#bib18\">Egelhofer et al., 2011</a>). To assess Tat\u2019s role in coupling transcription initiation with elongation at class I TSG, we calculated the fold change in H3K79me3 and H3K36me3 tag density in the presence and absence of Tat (Tat/GFP) as well as changes in their gene average distribution in both class I and II TSG (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a>). As expected, we observed that class I TSG (activated at the initiation step) also shows evidence of transcription elongation, based on the increase in H3K79me3/H3K36me3, total Pol II and elongating Pol II levels, as well as recruitment of the P-TEFb kinase at two TSG (<i>CD69</i> and <i>ADCYAP1</i>) (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). While in the absence of Tat, class I TSG are devoid of H3K79me3 throughout the gene, Tat promotes a robust increase in H3K79me3 (\u223c6.2-fold over GFP) just downstream of the TSS with a progressive decline towards the transcription termination site (TTS) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Similarly, levels of H3K36me3 at class I TSG are low in the gene body and increase towards the 3\u2019-end of the gene in the presence of Tat (\u223c5.3-fold over GFP) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Remarkably, the average distribution patterns of both H3K79me3 and H3K36me3 in these genes are consistent with previous genome-wide distribution analysis (<a href=\"#bib56\">Kouzarides, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Li et al., 2007</a>)."

If this were the case, then we would expect to find an increase in nucleosome modifications associated with transcription elongation marks in the presence of Tat, despite the lack of H3K4me3 increase. To test this possibility, we examined H3K36me3 and H3K79me3 distribution and density in these genes. We ignored genes that lack H3K79me3 irrespective of Tat presence as well as intronless genes, which complicated the density and distribution calculations, and thus ended with a more cohesive and consistently behaved group of class II TSG (n = 43). As expected, most class II TSG showed increased H3K79me3 (100%) and H3K36me3 (\u223c82%) levels within their gene bodies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a>) consistent with a role of Tat in promoting transcription elongation. Together, this analysis suggests that the majority of target genes that do not experience transcription initiation changes in response to Tat do show evidence of increased levels of promoter escape and transition to active elongation based on the global analysis of chromatin signatures (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) and Pol II (see below). Although the increase in H3K79me3 is significant, H3K36me3 changes are smaller, probably because class II TSG is active and their transcribing units already demarcated by H3K36me3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a>). Again, the average gene distribution of H3K79me3 and H3K36me3 correlates with previous studies suggesting that H3K79me3 is most enriched shortly downstream of the TSS and H3K36me3 increases towards the middle and end of the gene (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Kouzarides, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Li et al., 2007</a>)."

Conversely, at the <i>VAV3</i> guanine nucleotide exchange factor locus (class II TSG), the H3K4me3 signature surrounding the TSS does not appear to change, while the markers of active transcription in coding units (H3K79me3 and H3K36me3) showed large increases in the presence of Tat, indicating a role in transcription elongation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Heatmap representation of the density of all three chromatin signatures at promoter and gene body of class I and class II TSG demonstrate that this is common for all target genes, albeit with differences in fold change (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013E</a>), which is in agreement with the broad distribution of gene expression changes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

To test if Tat does indeed interact with these enzymes, we first affinity purified (AP) Strep-tagged Tat (or GFP, used as negative control) from nuclear fractions of the Jurkat T-cell lines and observed that Tat, but not GFP, binds both Dot1L and SetD2 as well as the P-TEFb kinase (CDK9) used as positive control in this assay (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). To further test whether changes in the epigenetic landscape directly correlate with the recruitment of these chromatin modifiers to specific genes, we performed ChIP followed by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) and found that the Tat-mediated recruitment of Dot1L and SetD2 to the <i>CD69</i> locus (class I TSG) correlates well with the increase in the histone modifications associated with transcription elongation as well as Pol II (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5B,C</a>). To provide a functional link between the Tat-mediated recruitment of these chromatin modifiers and gene expression changes, we used short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to target Dot1L and SetD2 by RNA interference (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5D\u2013H</a>). Interestingly, we noted that after knockdown of these chromatin-modifying enzymes as well as of CDK9, the increase in CD69 RNA levels (but not RPL19) in response to Tat is virtually abolished, implying that Tat-mediated recruitment of Dot1L, SetD2 and P-TEFb to TSG is a requisite for their increased transcription elongation levels,\u00a0which\u00a0is in agreement with the ChIP data (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Therefore, if Tat promotes transcription initiation and elongation as proposed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), we would expect Pol II levels to fluctuate in response to Tat in ways that reflect the specific mode of activation.

It is noteworthy that this observation is consistent with the model that Tat mediates transcription initiation at class I TSG. Conversely, as expected, we did not see higher levels of Pol II at the promoters of class II TSG in response to Tat (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B,D</a>).

Examination of two class II TSG (<i>VAV3</i> and <i>CD82</i>) using Chip-qPCR clearly demonstrates that Tat induces Pol II elongation by recruiting the P-TEFb kinase at those target genes (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Consistently, a metagene analysis shows that Tat largely increases Pol II density throughout the gene body and 3\u2019-end of class II TSG, but not at the promoter, in agreement with a role of Tat in promoting the transition to elongation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Therefore, in the absence of Tat stimulation, the majority of Pol II at class II TSG accumulates in the promoter-proximal region with a peak just downstream of the TSS while Tat strongly induces increased Pol II density in the gene body but not in the promoter-proximal region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Genome browser views of individual class II TSG such as <i>VAV3</i> are consistent with the elongation function (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), and are also in perfect agreement with the analysis of chromatin signatures related to elongation (H3K79me3 and H3K36me3) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

To further elucidate how Tat promotes transcription by binding to promoters or intragenic sites, we examined how chromatin signatures associated with these genomic domains change in response to Tat. Promoters bound by Tat are marked with the expected signature: high H3K4me3 and low H3K27Ac (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Creyghton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Heintzman and Ren, 2009</a>).

Notably, we observed that in the absence of Tat, the intragenic sites at class I TSG have low or undetectable levels of H3K27Ac (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), consistent with the idea that these genes are inactive or only minimally transcribed in the basal state without Tat (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). However, Tat increases H3K27Ac density near its intragenic binding sites by \u223c2\u201310-fold depending on the gene (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Conversely, in the absence of Tat, H3K27Ac levels at the intragenic sites of class II TSG are high and Tat increases their density, albeit with a lower fold-change than in class I TSG (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). This is consistent with the model that these genes are active in the basal state and Tat activates a post-initiation step, namely transcription elongation. Metagene analysis of class I TSG indicates that the H3K27Ac mark at intragenic binding sites is virtually absent at the immediate binding site itself but high in the nucleosomes directly surrounding the Tat peak, progressively declining further up and downstream from the binding site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). At these sites, Tat increased H3K27Ac levels an average of \u223c3-fold. A similar H3K27Ac distribution pattern is observed in class II TSG, even though the magnitude of H3K27Ac increase is smaller (\u223c1.5-fold) because these genes are already active in the absence of Tat (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>)."

To test this possibility, we performed ChIP assays on one class I TSG (<i>PPM1H</i>) and class II TSG (<i>CD82</i>). Notably, we observed that in the presence of Tat, the increase in H3K27Ac levels at class I intragenic sites in response to Tat mirrors the recruitment of p300 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>).

However, the correlation between H3K27Ac density at the intragenic site and gene expression levels at class II TSG is quite low (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.0728) because these genes are already marked by H3K27Ac in the absence of Tat (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

We performed chromosome conformation capture (3C) to assess the association of two intragenic Tat target sites and the promoter. We also performed a similar analysis between the gene promoter and distal intergenic sites located at a similar distance from the promoter but not bound by Tat. We used anchoring points near the gene promoter to measure the extent of chromatin looping between the promoter and the intragenic Tat-bound sites or the distal control domain. Interestingly, this analysis revealed that prior to Tat stimulation there is no obvious interaction between the gene promoter and the two intragenic Tat-bound sites. However, Tat promotes a strong association between the two sites, albeit with different crosslinking efficiencies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>), and this gene looping needs a functional Tat, because the C22A non-functional Tat mutant does not promote this effect (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Moreover, the effect of Tat on chromatin looping is specific as there was no detectable association when a control anchor primer was placed about 20 kb upstream from the <i>PPM1H</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We used FP in the Jurkat-GFP and -Tat cell lines and performed 3C experiments to uncouple the assembly of enhancer complexes and gene looping per se from eRNA production.

Previously, an algorithm that computes Pol II levels in promoter-proximal regions and gene body (termed Traveling Ratio [TR]) has been devised to examine the transition from initiation into elongation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib88\">Rahl et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Reppas et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Wade and Struhl, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</a>). We thought to apply such an algorithm to examine Tat functions in initiation and elongation by comparing Pol II levels found in promoter-proximal regions (-50 to +1000 respective to the TSS) versus levels within the gene body. Unexpectedly, we found in our ChIP-seq datasets that in both the presence and absence of Tat, Pol II levels tend to peak not only near the promoter of many genes, but also at certain intronic domains marked by H3K27Ac and H3K4me1, sometimes at densities similar to those found at the promoter-proximal region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These sites do not contain any known annotation in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser and does not appear to contain a non-canonical TSS because the H3K4me3 levels are low-to-undetectable. Thus, to examine if these Pol II forms were technical artifacts, we performed ChIP-seq with other Pol II Abs (total Pol II, CTD, Ser5P-CTD and Ser2P-CTD), both in the absence and presence of Tat, and found that, irrespective of the Ab used, this stably paused Pol II form was detected in the gene body, albeit with variable density levels (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly, genome browser searches revealed that intragenically poised Pol II is also detected in primary CD4+ T cells, thus ruling out the possibility that it is an artifact of Pol II distribution present in immortalized T cell lines growing in tissue culture. Moreover, examination of our ChIP-seq chromatin signature tracks indicated that the sites of intragenic Pol II pausing correspond to potential enhancers because they are marked with the corresponding enhancer signature (high H3K4me1/H3K27Ac and low H3K4me3) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Heintzman and Ren, 2009</a>)."

The problem arises because the TR algorithm treats all Pol II in the gene body as actively elongating. This assumption is invalid in cases where Pol II appears paused intragenically or is detected at an intragenic enhancer because of chromatin looping. In order to circumvent this problem we devised a custom-made algorithm referred to as \u2018modified TR\u2019 (mTR) to identify intragenic enhancers marked by H3K4me1/H3K27Ac and paused Pol II. mTR accurately categorizes these sites to more precisely calculate the promoter-proximal and gene body Pol II counts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We defined paused Pol II (pPol II) as Pol II located in both the promoter-proximal region (-50/+1000 from the TSS) and at intragenic sites marked with H3K27Ac (as determined by MACS2, with a peak cutoff of p-value &lt;0.05) and having a read density/nt greater than five times that of the average density/nt within the gene body. Of note, we used a window of -50/+1000 from the TSS (rather than -50/+300) because several genes contained accumulation of Pol II beyond the +100, and up to the +1000 position. Transcribing Pol II (tPol II) is defined as Pol II in the remainder of the gene that is not associated with the enhancer signature. Then, the mTR is the ratio of average pPol II (promoter + gene body) density to average tPol II (gene body) density (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). As expected, class II TSG showed decreased mTR in the presence of Tat compared\u00a0with the GFP cell line (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

Therefore, to more clearly explore Tat\u2019s role in controlling elongation, we computed densities for both Pol II classes (pPol II and tPol II) and compared them separately in the GFP and Tat cell lines. For each gene, we calculated the ratio of average pPol II and tPol II densities in the two cell lines (Tat/GFP) and plotted them on the X- and Y-axis, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). This\u00a0plot demonstrates clearly the Pol II behavior in response to Tat, both in terms of changes to initiation and elongation. While class I TSG showed profound increase in pPol II and tPol II as\u00a0a consequence of transcription initiation/elongation activation, class II TSG showed, albeit with gene-specific differences, higher evidence of elongation (increased tPol II form in the presence of Tat) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

Thus, we computationally examined chromatin signatures throughout promoter-proximal and -distal regions of TDG to determine at which step in the transcription cycle Tat blocks gene activation. Despite the identification of genes having marked changes in both chromatin initiation (H3K4me3) and elongation signatures (H3K79me3 and H3K36me3) such as <i>CD1E</i> and <i>FBLN2</i>, or\u00a0only\u00a0chromatin elongation signatures such as <i>EOMES</i> and <i>HSPA8</i>, this distinction did not become as clear for genes having low gene expression changes (&lt;3-fold). Therefore, we used a combined chromatin/Pol II signature to identify initiation- (class I) and elongation-regulated (class II) TDG (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). We defined class I TDG as genes having chromatin and Pol II signatures consistent with inhibited transcription initiation, with at least 60% decrease in H3K4me3 surrounding the TSS and 30% decrease in promoter-proximal Pol II with Tat (fold H3K4me3 <sub>Tat/GFP</sub>&lt;0.4 and fold Pol II<sub>Tat/GFP</sub>&lt;0.7). Conversely, class II TDG are inhibited at later stages of transcription because H3K4me3 and Pol II promoter-proximal levels remain virtually unchanged in the presence of Tat (fold H3K4me3 <sub>Tat/GFP</sub>&gt;0.7 and fold Pol II<sub>Tat/GFP</sub>&gt;0.75). Therefore, we defined class II TDG as genes having less than 30% decrease H3K4me3 surrounding the TSS and less than 25% decrease in promoter-proximal Pol II level in response to Tat. Using this signature, we identified 11 class I TDG and 14 class II TDG that strictly pass the above-mentioned criteria. Remarkably, these genes also appear to be controlled at the initiation and elongation level in primary T<sub>CM</sub> cells infected with HIV (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8E,F</a>). Although further research is needed to pinpoint the details, the rest of the genes could be a mixed class I-II population in which Tat simultaneously interfere with both the initiation and elongation steps (see Discussion)."

In support of this view, we observed a statistically significant correlation between the decrease in H3K4me3 levels surrounding the TSS and RNA levels at class I TDG but not class II (data not shown). To further examine how Tat blocks the initiation step, we performed detailed ChIP-qPCR assays to monitor the occupancy of subunits of the transcription pre-initiation complex (PIC). Interestingly, we observed that Tat recruitment to the <i>CD1E</i> gene promoter blocks the step of PIC assembly as denoted by the sharp decrease in the occupancy levels of TBP, Mediator (MED1), Pol II and the P-TEFb kinase (CDK9) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), in agreement with the virtual removal of H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,G</a>). On the contrary, class II TDG showed no significant change in H3K4me3 density surrounding the TSS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,H</a>), which\u00a0is\u00a0in agreement with the lack of Tat effects at the transcription initiation level. Consistently, at the class II TDG <i>EOMES</i>, Tat does not interfere with PIC assembly (as revealed by identical levels of TBP and MED1 at the promoter). However, Tat blocks Pol II transition into productive elongation due to dismissal of P-TEFb from both the promoter and transcription unit (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), which affects levels of total Pol II and the elongating form (Ser2P) in the gene body but not at the promoter-proximal region at two class II TDG (<i>EOMES</i> and <i>HSPA8</i>) (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>)."

The metagene analysis clearly indicated that all class I TDG showed reduced levels of both chromatin elongation signatures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,F</a>). However, the difference in magnitude at different genes was very broad, most likely due to the fact that these genes are transcribed at different levels and their abundance (based on RNA-seq) is quite disparate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,E</a>). Genome browser inspection of individual genes such\u00a0as <i>CD1E</i>, which is expressed at high levels, provide evidence that Tat is a very potent transcription initiation repressor, as revealed by the large drop in all chromatin signatures profiled (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>) and inhibition of PIC assembly at the promoter, as revealed by the dismissal of TBP, MED1, CDK9 and Pol II at the <i>CD1E</i> loci (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Genome browser inspection of individual class II TDG such\u00a0as <i>EOMES</i> demonstrate that Tat blocks the transition to elongation because Pol II density largely decreases at the transcribing unit without significant alterations in the promoter-proximal region, consistent with decreased chromatin elongation signatures but no H3K4me3 effects (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). However, surprisingly, a few genes showed no change in H3K79me3 modification, or even a small increase, right after the TSS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), possibly related to the fact that Dot1L-mediated establishment of H3K79me3 also has been linked with transcriptional repression (<a href=\"#bib81\">Nguyen and Zhang, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Onder et al., 2012</a>).

We first analyzed levels of Pol II at both Tat binding sites (Tat peak) and promoters of associated genes for both class I and II TDG. Interestingly, we found that Tat blocks Pol II recruitment at both the Tat binding site and promoter-proximal region of class I TDG (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>), in perfect agreement with the Tat-mediated decrease in H3K4me3 at those promoters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Remarkably, these observations are in agreement with the model that Tat blocks transcription initiation at class I TDG. Conversely, as expected based on the global analysis of chromatin signatures, Tat does not appear to largely block Pol II recruitment at the Tat peak and promoter of class II TDG (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B,D</a>), which we proposed to be regulated at the elongation level based on the global analysis of chromatin signatures and Pol II levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

This analysis indicates that the presence of an ETS1 motif at the Tat target genes is not by itself sufficient to determine the mechanism of action (stimulation or downregulation) or whether Tat modulates the initiation or elongation step of transcription. ETS1 may help recruit Tat to chromatin but it needs another determinant for specificity or mode of action, most likely related to the transcriptional activity status or yet unidentified co-factors (protein and/or long-non coding RNA), which might function in a gene-specific manner."

To test this possibility we performed ChIP assays on the Jurkat-GFP and -Tat cell lines using primer-pairs that amplify both promoter-proximal and promoter-distal regions of different Tat target genes. We found that Tat and ETS1 co-occupy the <i>CD69</i> promoter but not gene body (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), consistent with the motif enrichment analysis and a previous ETS1 ChIP-seq dataset (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hollenhorst et al., 2009</a>).

In addition, Tat binds some target genes lacking ETS1 motifs such as <i>CD1E</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>).

However, a comprehensive description of the direct target genes and the nature of the regulatory mechanisms have yet to be discovered. In this article, we report a technically improved Tat ChIP-seq assay that dramatically increases sensitivity compared with previous methodologies. Furthermore, by simultaneously assaying transcriptome changes and Tat\u2019s genome-wide distribution we combinatorially identified direct Tat targets in the human genome with high confidence. In contrast to previous studies, we were able to elucidate a large proportion of Tat binding sites in the human genome that correlate with marked gene expression changes (activation or repression) at both the RNA and protein levels. Importantly, the Tat target genes shared functional annotations, and are regulated (for the most part) by a common set of master transcriptional regulators."

While some sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors recruit Pol II and the basal transcription apparatus to promote transcription initiation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hahn, 2004</a>), others function at the elongation step by allowing Pol II transition from a promoter paused state to the productive elongation phase (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman and Lis, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Rahl et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>). By performing a global analysis of chromatin signatures that are generally associated with different genomic domains (promoter, coding units and enhancers) together with genome-wide Pol II distribution data in the absence and presence of Tat, we described, for the first time, the precise nature of the mechanisms of transcriptional activation and repression by Tat. Strikingly, we found that Tat directly controls both the initiation and elongation steps to transcriptionally reprogram the cell. Tat promotes Pol II recruitment at promoters and transcribing units to stimulate the transcription initiation and elongation steps, respectively. Conversely, Tat blocks Pol II recruitment to promoters or transcribing units to prevent the initiation and elongation steps, respectively, thereby leading to gene repression. Remarkably, the global analysis of chromatin signatures is consistent (for the most part) with the proposed mechanisms based on Pol II occupancy changes. For example, class I TSG (regulated at the initiation step) showed a large increase in both Pol II and H3K4me3 at promoter-proximal regions, consistent with their functional link in activating gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib96\">Shilatifard, 2012</a>). Although we have not searched for the H3K4 methylase, it would be interesting to define whether Tat hijacks one or more of Set/MLL methylases and whether DoT1L and the SEC are co-recruited to link transcription initiation with elongation (<a href=\"#bib70\">Luo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Nguyen and Zhang, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Shilatifard, 2012</a>). In addition, the mechanism by which Tat reduces H3K4me3 density at some class II TSG remains yet unknown, but it may be possible that Tat recruitment to the promoter region interferes with the H3K4me3 signature, as has been seen with the NS1 protein during influenza virus infection (<a href=\"#bib72\">Marazzi et al., 2012</a>). Although we have described that Tat associates with and recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes to target genes, one important aspect of the mechanism that we have not clarified yet is that the histone modifications may represent (in some cases) indirect effects of changes in transcription and not a direct consequence of Tat function on the genome."

                        "text": "Despite the canonical view of transcriptional regulation through transcription factor-promoter DNA interaction, it has recently become evident that internal promoters, intragenic enhancers and other genomic elements contribute to specify transcriptional programs through the formation of three-dimensional structures (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bulger and Groudine, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Creyghton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ghavi-Helm et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Heintzman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Jin et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with these discoveries, we found that Tat exploits the human genome by binding not only at promoters but also at intergenic and intragenic sites to modulate long-range chromatin interactions and transcription activation from these promoter-distal sites. We observed that at a large number of class I TSG (regulated at the initiation step) Tat binds at intragenic sites to modulate enhancer activity. In the absence of Tat, the nucleosomes surrounding these sites contain low or undetectable histone modifications related to enhancer activity (H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac). Tat binding increases their density in a manner that is proportional to transcriptional levels. Notably, this increase also correlates with the recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes (p300/CBP) at the Tat site, chromatin looping between the internal site and the promoter, and Pol II recruitment to trigger de novo transcription initiation. The role of intragenic Pol II pausing requires further investigation but it may be possible that this form of Pol II is required for active transcription elongation\u00a0by promoting template DNA circularization or acting after gene looping. This Pol II form might not have been observed in embryonic stem cells because most, if not all, genes are incompetent for elongation and Pol II is primarily paused in the promoter-proximal region."

The gene looping hypothesis provides a mechanistic explanation for the molecular effects observed at the promoter (namely Pol II recruitment and increase in H3K4me3 density) in response to Tat binding at promoter-distal sites, even without detectable Tat at the promoter-proximal region. Although we have shown that the C22A non-functional mutant (which does not dimerize) does not promote gene looping, it would be interesting to further test whether the Tat-mediated long-range chromatin interactions are controlled by protein homo-dimerization, a feature of Tat that was originally described by Frankel and Pabo (<a href=\"#bib22\">Frankel et al., 1988</a>), but whose function has since then remained largely elusive. Furthermore, the role of intragenic enhancers in activating gene expression is an attractive possibility, and might help recruit chromatin-modifying enzymes for compartmentalization purposes and/or \u2018on site\u2019 activation."

Surprisingly, in contrast to activation of the HIV genome, we found insignificant enrichment of TAR-like motifs at Tat binding sites in the human genome. Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that nascent RNA chains (folding or not into TAR-like structures) help Tat recruitment to host cell chromatin, we unexpectedly found that Tat occupies sites bound by master transcriptional regulators (ETS1) with high frequency. Notably, we provided biochemical and genetic evidence that ETS1 recruits Tat to chromatin to modulate (activate or repress) gene transcription. ETS1 is a member of a large family of transcription factors (ETS) that play important roles in T-cell stimulation and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Hollenhorst et al., 2011</a>). ETS1 requires combinatorial interactions with other factors (such as RUNX1) to activate transcription. We propose that, similarly\u00a0to RUNX1, Tat uses ETS1 as a scaffold to promote its recruitment to target genes and modulate gene transcription. Given that ETS1 is found at both activated and repressed genes, it is evident that ETS1 does not dictate per se the mode of regulation (activation or repression). For the mechanism of gene activation, a likely scenario would be that Tat is recruited to ETS1 to relieve its auto-inhibition and recruit Pol II, elongation factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes. For the mechanism of gene repression, Tat might compete off factors pre-associated with ETS1 (such as RUNX1) and block PIC assembly (in the case of transcription initiation blockage) or prevent the action of elongation factors such as P-TEFb (in the case of transcription elongation repression). Although ETS1 appears to play a central role in the recruitment of Tat to several direct target genes (irrespective of the transcriptional outcome), it is completely possible that several other co-factors including long non-coding RNAs and/or proteins function combinatorially to specify target loci identification and Tat function."

One particular observation derived from the motif analysis is that the ETS1 motif identified at both TSG and TDG contain a common sequence (5\u2019-GGAA-3\u2019) but differ in the -1/-2 positions. Of note, transcription factor binding sites slightly differing in sequence have been shown to modulate various steps of the transcription cycle including transcription factor binding affinity and conformational changes upon their recruitment to target sequences, as well as co-factor recruitment (<a href=\"#bib77\">Meijsing et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, the difference in the ETS1 motifs at TSG and TDG might contain information utilized by Tat (and/or Tat co-factors) to activate or repress transcription. Undoubtedly, further research is required to elucidate the precise molecular basis."

In addition, the analysis of transcriptome changes using RNA-seq (which measures steady-state RNA levels and not transcription per se) has some caveats, for example difficulties in detecting low abundance or highly unstable RNAs. Potentially, this may help explain why we also found a large fraction of binding events that do not have a correlate with gene expression changes. Other tools such as GRO-seq (<a href=\"#bib11\">Core et al., 2008</a>), which measure levels of nascent RNAs, will also be needed to further improve the definition of direct and indirect target genes. Moreover, a more recent and powerful technique named NET-seq yields transcriptional activity at nucleotide resolution and thus outperforms GRO-seq (<a href=\"#bib76\">Mayer et al., 2015</a>). Certainly, these tools will provide much higher-resolution to define target sites, modes of Tat recruitment and improved functional insights. Nonetheless, our work provides the first comprehensive view of how Tat modulates the biology of immune target cells by mediating key transcriptional changes. Interestingly, Tat can potentially perform different functions depending on the target cell type. Thus, it would be informative to determine how host adaptability is harnessed by a viral protein to selectively reprogram transcription in a cell lineage-specific manner."

Finally, our data provide yet another example on how a virus with a limited coding capacity optimized its genome by evolving a small but \u2018multi-tasking\u2019 protein to simultaneously control viral and cellular transcription using distinct regulatory strategies."

The Jurkat HIV E4 clone was kindly provided by Dr. J. Karn and described elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib84\">Pearson et al., 2008</a>). Jurkat T-REx cells were maintained in the same conditions as for Jurkat but in the presence of 10 \u03bcg/ml Blasticidin as indicated by the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). The derived Jurkat T-REx clones (GFP and Tat bearing the Strep/Flag (SF) epitope: GFP-SF and Tat-SF, respectively) were selected with 300 \u03bcg/ml of zeocin for four weeks and later cultured with 10 \u03bcg/ml Blasticidin and 100 \u03bcg/ml zeocin (Life Technologies). The Tat cell line was cultured for less than 3 months because it otherwise loses Tat expression and responsiveness. To generate the stable GFP:SF and Tat:SF expressing cell lines, the parental Jurkat T-REx was electroporated with 2 \u03bcg of Ssp1-linearized pcDNA4/TO vector (Life Technologies) bearing either insert using a nucleofector kit V and a Nucleofector II electroporator (Lonza,\u00a0Walkersville,\u00a0MD). To induce expression of GFP:SF and Tat:SF, the stable cell lines were treated with 1 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline (DOX, Sigma,\u00a0St.\u00a0Louis,\u00a0MO) for 16 hr (or as indicated). We chose to utilize a SF-tagged Tat protein and immunoprecipitate Tat:SF using an anti-FLAG antibody due to our inability to efficiently immunoprecipitate Tat under denaturing conditions with the available commercial anti-Tat antibodies from Covance (catalogue number MMS-116) and Abcam (ab43014)."

The cDNA was then size selected, amplified, purified with AmpureXP beads (Beckman Coulter,\u00a0Brea,\u00a0CA) and quality checked on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Samples were quantified by qPCR using SOLiD adapter primers per the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems) and the EZ-Bead system was used to amplify the libraries onto the sequencing beads for high-throughput sequencing on a SOLiD 5500xl instrument (Applied Biosystems)."

Cells were washed twice with PBS and re-suspended in 1 ml of nuclei extraction buffer (5 mM PIPES pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor [Roche]) at 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>7</sup> cells/ml and incubated for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Cell nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5\u2009min at 4\u00b0C, and re-suspended in Szak's RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) at 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>7</sup> nuclei/ml. Nuclear pellets were sonicated using the Bioruptor water bath (Diagenode) using the high setting with 30 sec on 30 sec off for 45\u2009min to generate 100\u2013300 bp DNA fragments. Chromatin DNA was quantified with NanoDrop 1000 (Agilent). For the ChIP step, 1\u20133 \u03bcg of antibody was conjugated with 15 \u03bcl of protein G dynabeads (Life Technologies) and blocked with 0.16% bovine serum albumin for 16 hr at 4\u00b0C. Antibody-conjugated dynabeads were incubated with 30\u201350 \u03bcg of chromatin DNA for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C. Then the beads were sequentially washed two times with the following buffers: low salt buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA), high salt buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA), LiCl wash buffer (0.25M LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and 1 mM Tris-EDTA pH 8.0. Chromatin immunocomplexes were eluted by incubation for 10\u2009min at 65\u00b0C with 1% SDS and 100 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and cross-linking was reversed by incubation in the solution adjusted to 200 mM NaCl and proteinase K (20 \u03bcg) for 1 hr at 65\u00b0C.

In our Pol II ChIP-seq dataset, we noted that Pol II density is elevated above active transcription levels not only at the promoter-proximal location, but also at discrete positions within bodies of actively transcribed genes. These positions are often accompanied by H3K27Ac chromatin marks. We found that these positions are three-dimensionally positioned near the TSS and are actually representative of a form of paused Pol II, not actively transcribing Pol II. Therefore, our modified traveling ratio (mTR) is calculated as follows: promoter-proximal Pol II ChIP reads/promoter-distal Pol II ChIP reads. Promoter-proximal Pol II ChIP reads are considered to be all reads aligned between \u201330 to +1000 bp of the TSS and all reads present in distal locations having a H3K27Ac peak (as determined by the method provided above) within 500 bp and having a density greater than 5\u00d7 the average Pol II density between TSS+1001 bp to TTS. Distal Pol II reads are considered to be all those from TSS+1001 bp to TTS that do not fit the criteria for promoter-proximal Pol II as indicated above. The mTR is a custom software and is publicly available. This is availble as <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Source code 1</a>."

In a first-pass filtering approach using seedtop (<a href=\"#bib97\">Shiryev et al., 2007</a>) from the NCBI BLAST package, we searched for the following pattern: X<sub>(2)</sub>-G-A-T-X<sub>(1,2)</sub>-G-A-X<sub>(4,40)</sub>-T-C-T-C-X<sub>(2)</sub>, yielding 51,559 sequence signatures. After subjecting these sequences to RNA Fold from the Vienna RNA package (<a href=\"#bib69\">Lorenz et al., 2011</a>) and calculating the partition function and base-pairing probability matrix, we used the maximum expected accuracy (MEA) structure and isolated sequences that fold in the corresponding bulged hairpin. In detail, we required the following conserved secondary structure (in dot-bracket notation, with x denoting either dot or bracket): X<sub>(2)</sub>-G-A-T-X<sub>(1,2)</sub>-G-A-X<sub>(4,40)</sub>-T-C-T-C-X<sub>(2)</sub> and X<sub>(2)-(-(-.-.(1,2)</sub>-(-(-X<sub>(4,40)</sub>-)-)-)-)-X<sub>(2)</sub>, resulting in 745 signatures covering 225 genes (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>)."

We decided to use primary CD4+ T cells (and not macrophages) because they are more closely related to the Jurkat CD4+ T-cell line used in our minimalistic study. We now show that specific TDG and TSG selected from our screen are in fact deregulated during a time course infection experiment in primary T cells. The results are shown in the new <a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8A,B</a>, the data discussed in the text (last paragraph of the subsection \u201cGenomic domains occupied and regulated by Tat in CD4+ T cells\u201d), and the materials and methods included (in the subsection \u201cPrimary CD4+ T cell isolation, stimulation and HIV infection\u201d). We also have demonstrated that the class I and class II TSG/TDG identified in the minimalistic Jurkat system (at least for the target genes examined by qRT-PCR) are also regulated at the initiation and elongation steps, respectively, during HIV infection of primary T cells. The results are shown in the new <a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8C\u2013F</a> and the data discussed in the text (in the subsection \u201cGlobal analysis of chromatin signatures indicates that Tat stimulates transcription at both the initiation and elongation steps\u201d, eighth paragraph for TSG and in the subsection \u201cGlobal analysis of chromatin signatures and Pol II distribution indicate that Tat downregulates transcription by blocking both initiation and elongation\u201d, end of first paragraph for TDG). Despite these significant additions to the revised manuscript, we were unable to perform the ETS1 knockdown in primary cells to measure Tat effects during infection. There are several explanations for the lack of success. First, it is extremely difficult to perform RNAi in primary cells due to the presence of several endogenous barriers. Second, also importantly, ETS1 knockdown affects cell growth and viability and thus compromises the infection step. Also, unfortunately, we were not able to perform ChIP assays for Pol II and other markers because of the large number of cells required for these experiments. Nonetheless, we have provided compelling evidence that the Tat target genes identified using our genome-wide analysis in Jurkat cells are relevant to normal HIV-1 infection of primary CD4+ T cells and we have provided evidence of Tat-mediated transcriptional control at the initiation and elongation steps. We hope the reviewers value the investment made and the data yielded from this new set of experiments in primary cells."

The findings are completely in line with previous publications showing that the level of histone marks such as H3K4me3 and H3K79me3 generally correspond to transcription activity, but aren't very good at indicating actual transcription levels. But I don't see what this tells us about Tat activity. The authors should acknowledge that the histone modification data is likely to represent indirect effects of changes in transcription rather than direct targets of Tat activity.</i> "

However, it is worth noting the protein-protein interactions detected between Tat and the histone modifying enzymes Dot1L and SetD2 (in the subsection \u201cGlobal analysis of chromatin signatures indicates that Tat stimulates transcription at both the initiation and elongation steps\u201d, and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). This potentially indicates more than an indirect role in chromatin remodeling. In either case, direct or indirect, we found it worth noting that different groups of TSG and TDG exhibit different changes to the chromatin modification landscape, suggesting different modes of both activation and repression. Also, our data regarding a genome-wide histone landscape helps inform not only the specifics of Tat action, but also provides general insights regarding the role of histone modification at promoters and enhancers (some along the lines of previous investigations), including:"

Our class I thresholds were selected to isolate genes that appear to be transcriptionally inactive prior to Tat stimulation, and then are activated at the level of transcription initiation. The threshold for class II TSG was selected to identify genes that are already transcriptionally active prior to Tat and are then further stimulated at the level of elongation. Our findings show that a very small number of genes are activated from an \u201coff\u201d state (17 class I TSG), which, as the reviewers correctly note, does not allow for broad conclusions about one generic method of Tat stimulation. It does, however, demonstrate that there is more than one mechanism utilized by Tat to activate/stimulate target genes, and that different genes are targeted in different manners. With regards to the signal at the class I genes being indistinguishable from noise, the ChIP-seq in the control cell line (GFP) provides compelling evidence that this is not the case. Our levels of signal to input were thoroughly vetted for reliability. Assuming that the reviewers are speaking about a marker such as H3K4me3, the levels of normalized tag densities do appear low, but the differences between the marker in the Tat vs. GFP cell lines are remarkable. The normalization to tag density per million reads yields small numbers in the metagene plots, but these nominal scales are far less important than the difference between control and test. Further, because the class I genes are nearly transcriptionally silent prior to perturbation by Tat, it does not require much of a change in the initiation markers to yield a noticeable increase in expression. We have now included examples of raw data (Genome browser views in IGV) in the modified <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a> so that the reader can see examples of real plots and nominal densities prior to averaging, in addition to the previous H3K4me3 levels in a gene-by-gene basis (modified <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

We apologize for the oversight of not including this information. We have now incorporated the number of class I and II TDG in every experiment (text and figure legends). We have explained in the original submission the approach used to classify TDG as class I or II. The reason for not including all TDG was that most of the genes might be a blend of class I and class II (probably regulated at both the initiation and elongation levels), or alternatively, regulated by unknown mechanisms. To make our findings of multiple modes of Tat action clear, we highlighted the most demonstrative cases of each mode and avoided attempting to tease out the mixed-mode genes. Those examples provide the best evidence that Tat is working on multiple transcription steps. We consider that defining all the mechanisms would be interesting and informative, but it may take additional data collection. For example, RNA-seq is not a direct measure of transcription and to strengthen the TDG classification we may need to collect transcriptional data by GRO-seq or NET-seq (Discussion). This is well beyond the scope of one single manuscript."
