                    "text": "The Arabidopsis immune receptor FLS2 perceives bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate defenses through the central cytoplasmic kinase BIK1. The heterotrimeric G proteins composed of the non-canonical G\u03b1 protein XLG2, the G\u03b2 protein AGB1, and the G\u03b3 proteins AGG1 and AGG2 are required for FLS2-mediated immune responses through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that in the pre-activation state, XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1, and it functions together with AGB1 and AGG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1, allowing optimum immune activation. Following the activation by flg22, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1 in the N terminus. The phosphorylated XLG2 enhances the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD. The study demonstrates that the G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms."

The heterotrimeric G proteins composed of the non-canonical G\u03b1 protein XLG2, the G\u03b2 protein AGB1, and the G\u03b3 proteins AGG1 and AGG2 are required for FLS2-mediated immune responses through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that in the pre-activation state, XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1, and it functions together with AGB1 and AGG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1, allowing optimum immune activation. Following the activation by flg22, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1 in the N terminus. The phosphorylated XLG2 enhances the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD. The study demonstrates that the G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms."

This ability involves signals from outside of the cell triggering changes to the activity inside the cell.

In animals and fungi, these proteins directly work with a specific class of receptor proteins called G protein-coupled receptors (or GPCRs for short).

Heterotrimeric G proteins also enhance defenses in at least two different ways. Firstly, in the absence of an infection, heterotrimeric G proteins stabilize the BIK1 protein to ensure that it is ready to respond. Secondly, if FLS2 does detect the telltale bacterial protein, BIK1 marks one of the heterotrimeric G proteins with a phosphate group. This then allows the G protein to boost the activity of another plant enzyme that is vital for defense signaling."

It forms a dynamic complex with the co-receptor BAK1 and the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 to perceive a conserved bacterial flagellar epitope, flg22, to activate a variety of defense responses (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chinchilla et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Heese et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sun et al., 2013</a>). Stability of FLS2 and BIK1 is subject to regulation by ubiquitin-proteasome system and a calcium-dependent protein kinase (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Monaghan et al., 2014</a>). We and others previously showed that BIK1 directly phosphorylates the NADPH oxidase RbohD to prime flg22-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kadota et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Li et al., 2014</a>)."

In the pre-activation state, the GDP-bound G\u03b1 interacts with the G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer to form a heterotrimer. Upon activation by GPCR, G\u03b1 exchanges GDP for GTP, resulting in the activation of the heterotrimer. The activated G\u03b1 and G\u03b2\u03b3 dissociate from each other to regulate downstream effectors. Plants contain canonical G\u03b1 (encoded by <i>GPA1</i> in Arabidopsis), G\u03b2 (encoded by <i>AGB1</i> in Arabidopsis), G\u03b3 proteins (encoded by <i>AGG1, AGG2</i>), and a non-canonical G\u03b3 (encoded by <i>AGG3</i> in Arabidopsis) (Urano and Jones, 2013). Plants additionally encode extra-large G proteins (XLGs, encoded by <i>XLG1, XLG2,</i> and <i>XLG3</i> in Arabidopsis) that carry a variable N-terminal domain and a C-terminal G\u03b1 domain (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lee and Assman, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ding et al., 2008</a>). Recent advances indicate that the Arabidopsis XLGs are functional G\u03b1 proteins and interact with G\u03b2\u03b3 dimers to form heterotrimers (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Maruta et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chakravorty et al., 2015</a>).

Recent reports indicate that XLG2, AGB1, and AGG1/2 mediate immune responses downstream of PRRs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ishikawa, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhu et al, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lorek et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Torres et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Maruta et al., 2015</a>). <i>XLG2</i> was first shown to play an important role in basal resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhu et al., 2009</a>). A recent report showed that <i>XLG2,</i> but not <i>XLG1,</i> is required for resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> and flg22-induced ROS production (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maruta et al., 2015</a>). <i>AGB1</i> and <i>AGG1/2,</i> but not <i>AGG3,</i> are required for resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> and microbial pattern-induced ROS production (<a href=\"#bib17\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lorek et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Torres et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, epistatic analyses indicated that <i>AGB1</i> acts in the same pathway as RbohD (<a href=\"#bib34\">Torres et al., 2013</a>). However, it is still debated whether plants possess 7 transmembrane GPCRs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Taddese et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Urano and Jones, 2014</a>). One recent report suggests that GPA1, AGG1/2 can interact with BAK1 and the chitin-binding receptor kinase CERK1, but not FLS2 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aranda-Sicilia et al., 2015</a>). However, GPA1 does not appear to play a role in flg22-induced ROS and disease resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Torres et al., 2013</a>). How XLG2 and AGB1 regulate PRR-mediated immunity remains elusive."

Prior to activation by flg22, the G proteins attenuate the proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1, ensuring optimum signaling competence. After flg22 stimulation, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1, indicating a ligand-induced dissociation of G\u03b1 from G\u03b2\u03b3. In addition, we provide evidence that activation by flg22 additionally leads to XLG2 phospohrylation by BIK1, and this phosphorylation positively regulates RbohD-dependent ROS production. Together the study illustrates two distinct mechanisms underlying the G protein-mediated regulation of the FLS2 signaling."

One mutant displayed significantly reduced resistance was <i>xlg2</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), confirming previous report by <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhu et al. (2009)</a>. Further characterization indicated that the mutant is compromised in flg22-induced ROS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), confirming results reported previously (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maruta et al., 2015</a>). An examination of gene expression showed that <i>XLG2, XLG3,</i> and <i>AGB1,</i> but not <i>XLG1,</i> were induced in response to flg22 treatment (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This is in agreement with the recent report that <i>XLG2/3,</i> but not <i>XLG1,</i> are required for flg22-induced responses and disease resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maruta et al., 2015</a>). A comparison of <i>xlg2</i> and <i>agb1</i> mutant showed that the two mutants were similarly compromised in flg22-induced ROS burst and resistance against <i>Pst,</i> supporting that they act together to regulate FLS2 immunity. Interestingly, <i>xlg2</i> plants were more susceptible to <i>Pst</i> than <i>agb1</i> plants in the absence of flg22 treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), suggesting that XLG2 plays additional role in plant immunity independent of AGB1. As reported previously (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maruta et al., 2015</a>), we found that the <i>xlg3</i> mutant was similar to WT in <i>Pst</i> resistance and flg22-induced ROS, whereas the <i>xlg2 xlg3</i> double mutant was slightly more defective in <i>Pst</i> resistance (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and flg22-induced ROS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), indicating that <i>XLG2/3</i> play additive roles in flg22-induced immunity. Because <i>AGG1/2</i>, but not <i>AGG3</i> and <i>GPA1</i>, are required for flg22-induced defense responses and <i>Pst</i> resistance (<a href=\"#bib17\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Torres et al., 2013</a>), these results confirmed that the heterotrimeric G proteins required for FLS2 signaling and <i>Pst</i> resistance include the non-canonical G\u03b1 proteins XLG2/3, G\u03b2 protein AGB1, and G\u03b3 proteins AGG1/2."

Consistent with this, luciferase complementation and co-immunoprecipitation assays detected XLG2-AGB1 and XLG3-AGB1 interactions in <i>Nicotiana Benthamiana (Nb)</i> plants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>) and Arabidopsis protoplasts (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013C</a>). Both the N and C termini of XLG2 are sufficient for the interaction with AGB1 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Note that XLG2-FLAG and AGB1-HA used in co-IP assays retain their biological functions when introduced into <i>agb1</i> protoplasts or <i>xlg2</i> plants (see below in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5E</a>). In the animal model, the heterotrimeric G protein is dynamically regulated upon ligand stimulation of GPCR. We tested whether flg22 treatment can similarly regulate XLG2-AGB1 interaction. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, the flg22 treatment resulted in a great reduction in XLG2-AGB1 interaction in <i>Nb</i> plants, suggesting that Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins are reminiscent of their animal counterparts in that the heterotrimer is dynamically regulated upon ligand activation of receptors. Because the heterotrimeric G protein mutants under investigation all display defects in flg22-induced ROS, which requires phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase RbohD by the BIK1 kinase (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kadota et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Li et al., 2014</a>), we monitored the flg22-induced phosphorylation of RbohD in <i>agb1</i> using antibodies that recognize the BIK1-specific S39 phosphorylation. Flg22-induced S39 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in <i>agb1</i> mutant protoplasts, whereas complementation of the mutant protoplasts with <i>AGB1</i> restored RbohD S39 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Consistent with a positive role of AGB1 in flg22-induced RbohD S39 phosphorylation, transient overexpression of <i>AGB1</i> in WT protoplasts resulted in constitutive S39 phosphorylation in RbohD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Together these results suggest that the hetero-trimeric G proteins regulate early components of the FLS2 signaling pathway."

LC-MS/MS analysis of the immune complex identified four peptides corresponding to PBL20 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), a homolog of BIK1. In contrast, immunoprecipitation of the control protein CPR5-FLAG failed to identify any PBL20 peptides. Co-IP and luciferase complementation assays confirmed that XLG2/3 indeed interacted strongly with PBL20 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>). AGB1 also interacted with PBL20, albeit much weaker than did XLG2. Because PBL20 and BIK1 belong to the same family of receptor like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) and share similar biochemical properties (<a href=\"#bib43\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>), we therefore tested whether BIK1 also interacts with the G proteins. Luciferase complementation assays showed that XLG2/3 strongly interacted with BIK1 but not BAK1 or CPR5 in <i>Nb</i> plants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), whereas AGB1 interacted with BIK1 at a much lower level. Similarly, FLS2 also displayed strong interactions with XLG2/3 and a weaker interaction with AGB1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The interactions were further confirmed by Co-IP assays (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In the absence of flg22 treatment, XLG2/3 strongly interacted with BIK1 and FLS2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Treatment of protoplasts with flg22 led to a much weaker interaction, indicating that flg22 induces dissociation of XLG2 from the FLS2 receptor complex. The BIK1<sup>K105E</sup>-HA mutant protein, which is defective in ATP-binding and dominantly inhibits flg22-induced signaling when expressed in protoplasts (<a href=\"#bib43\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>), interacted with XLG2 and XLG3 irrespective of the presence or absence of flg22, suggesting that the activation of the BIK1 kinase is required for the dissociation."

Similar to the full-length XLG2 protein, the C terminus of XLG2 also dissociated from BIK1 when protoplasts were treated with flg22 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). GST pull-down assays showed that the HIS-tagged C-terminal fragment of XLG2 strongly interacted with GST-tagged FLS2 kinase domain, but not GST alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), indicating that the C terminus of XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2. Surprisingly, GST pull-down assay showed a weak interaction between XLG2 and BIK1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Interestingly, phosphatase treatment of BIK1 enhanced its interaction with XLG2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), suggesting that XLG2 has greater affinity with non-phosphorylated BIK1. We similarly tested interaction between AGB1 with untreated and de-phosphorylated BIK1 by GST pull-down assay. While the un-treated BIK1 is unable to interact with AGB1, the de-phosphorylated form of BIK1 strongly interacted with AGB1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>).

To examine BIK1 accumulation, we crossed <i>agb1</i> with a transgenic line carrying a <i>BIK1-HA</i> transgene under control of the native <i>BIK1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib43\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>) and identified sibling transgenic lines of either <i>agb1</i> or <i>AGB1</i> genotype. Immunoblot analyses showed that the BIK1-HA protein accumulated to a much lower level in <i>agb1</i> compared to WT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), indicating that <i>AGB1</i> is required for BIK1 accumulation in plants. In contrast, FLS2 and BAK1 protein accumulation was not affected in <i>agb1,</i> indicating a specific effect on BIK1 protein. Examination of <i>BIK1-HA</i> transcripts indicated that the transgene is similarly expressed in <i>agb1</i> and WT plants (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To further rule out the possibility that AGB1 modulates BIK1 at transcriptional level, we transformed <i>agb1</i> and WT plants with <i>BIK1-HA</i> transgene under the control of the 35S promoter. Again, a much lower BIK1-HA accumulation was observed in <i>agb1</i> than in WT plants although the <i>BIK1-HA</i> transcripts accumulated to similar levels in the two lines (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Similarly, the BIK1-HA protein accumulation was greatly reduced in <i>agg1 agg2</i> double mutant plants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), indicating that <i>AGG1/2</i> are also required for BIK1 accumulation. We further asked whether <i>XLG2</i> and <i>XLG3</i> are required for BIK1 accumulation by transiently expressing BIK1-HA in <i>xlg2 xlg3</i> mutant protoplasts. Regardless of the promoter used for BIK1-HA expression, BIK1 accumulated to lower levels in the <i>xlg2 xlg3</i> double mutant than in WT protoplasts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), indicating that <i>XLG2/3</i> are also required for BIK1 accumulation. The defect in protein accumulation is specific to BIK1, as BAK1 accumulation was not affected in <i>xlg2 xlg3</i> protoplasts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The accumulation of BIK1-HA was not affected in <i>gpa1</i> mutant plants (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), a result that is consistent with previous report that GPA1 is not required for flg22-induced ROS (<a href=\"#bib17\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Torres et al., 2013</a>). BIK1 is known to be turned-over through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (<a href=\"#bib27\">Monaghan et al., 2014</a>). Treatment of plants with proteasome inhibitors PS341 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) and MG132 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) restored BIK1 accumulation in <i>agb1</i> mutant plants, suggesting that AGB1 regulates BIK1 stability through the proteasome pathway. We further performed <i>in vitro</i>\u00a0protein degradation assay to compare the rate of BIK1 degradation in total protein extracts from WT and mutant plants. The recombinant BIK1 was degraded in the WT extract, and this degradation was blocked by PS341 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), recapitulating the proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1 in plants. The rate of BIK1 degradation was more rapid in <i>agb1</i> and <i>xlg2 xlg3</i> extracts compared to that in the WT extract (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013F</a>). Because XLG2 also interacted with PBL20, we further tested whether XLG2/3 and AGB1 similarly regulate PBL20 stability. Indeed, PBL20 was also degraded in WT extracts, and this degradation was enhanced when extracts from <i>xlg2 xlg3</i> or <i>agb1</i> mutants were used (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013B</a>). Together these results demonstrate that the heterotrimeric G proteins formed by XLG2/3, AGB1, and AGG1/2 attenuate proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1 and PBL20."

We next asked whether increased copy number of <i>BIK1</i> could rescue flg22-induced ROS burst in <i>agb1</i> mutant. Introgression of the <i>NP::BIK1-HA</i> transgene into <i>agb1</i> by crossing significantly enhanced flg22-induced ROS production in these plants compared to <i>agb1</i> plants that contained only the endogenous copy of <i>BIK1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating that increasing BIK1 accumulation by the transgene at least partially restored flg22-induced ROS in <i>agb1.</i> Col-0 <i>NP::BIK1-HA</i> plants displayed higher level of ROS compared to non-transgenic WT plants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), indicating that BIK1 protein level is rate-limiting in flg22-induced immune responses. We further tested the impact of the <i>NP::BIK1-HA</i> transgene on flg22-induced resistance to <i>Pst.</i> While the <i>agb1</i> consistently supported greater amount of bacterial growth compared to WT plants following flg22 treatment, the <i>agb1 NP::BIK1-HA</i> plants were indistinguishable from WT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

We similarly introduced the <i>NP::BIK1-HA</i> transgene into <i>xlg2 xlg3</i> double mutant plants by transformation. The resulting transgenic lines displayed near WT ROS production (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) and <i>Pst</i> resistance (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) in response to flg22 treatment, indicating that <i>XLG2/3</i> also regulate FLS2-mediated immunity by controlling BIK1 stability."

An examination of XLG2\u2009N-terminal fragment expressed in protoplasts following flg22 treatment showed a prominent shift in protein migration in SDS-PAGE (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The shift of protein mobility was sensitive to phosphatase treatment, which is indicative of flg22-induced phosphorylation in XLG2. The flg22-induced phosphorylation similarly occurred to the N terminus of XLG3, but not XLG1 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which is consistent with the notion that XLG2/3 but not XLG1, are involved in flg22 signaling. To determine phospho-sites in XLG2, we expressed full-length XLG2-FLAG in protoplasts. Following flg22 treatment, the XLG2-FLAG protein was affinity-purified and subject to LC-MS/MS analysis for phospho-peptides. We were able to recover 87% of total peptide sequence, among which we identified 23 phospho-peptides corresponding to at least 15 phospho-sites (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Interestingly, all but two phospho-peptides were located in the N terminus. Strikingly, phospho-sites between amino acids 141\u2013156 accounted for nearly half of the phospho-peptides. We further tested whether these are the major phospho-sites by site-directed mutagenesis. Simultaneously substituting three to four of these residues into non-phosphorylatable alanine (XLG2<sup>S148A,S150A,S151A</sup>; XLG2<sup>S141A,S148A,S150A,S151A</sup>) resulted in severe reduction to complete elimination in flg22-induced band shift in XLG2\u2009N terminus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), indicating that amino acids Ser141, Ser148, Ser150 and Ser151 are indeed required for overall phosphorylation of XLG2 in response to flg22 treatment."

While the <i>xlg2</i> transgenic lines carrying the WT or phospho-mimicking <i>XLG2-FLAG</i> transgene completely restored the flg22-induced ROS to WT level, the two lines transformed with the non-phosphorylatable <i>XLG2-FLAG</i> transgene only partially restored the flg22-induced ROS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). The inability of phospho-mimicking XLG2 to constitutively activate ROS suggests that the phosphorylation of XLG2 is required, but not sufficient, for optimum activation of RbohD. We further introduced WT and the non-phosphorylatable <i>XLG2-FLAG</i> transgene into <i>xlg2/3</i> double mutants, and inoculated independent lines with <i>Pst.</i> While the line carrying the WT <i>XLG2-FLAG</i> transgene was fully restored in resistance to <i>Pst</i> that was indistinguishable from the WT non-transgenic plants, the two lines transformed with the non-phosphorylatable <i>XLG-FLAG</i> transgene were only marginally more resistant to <i>Pst</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). These results indicated that the phosphorylation is required, but not sufficient, for full function of XLG2. We next asked whether the phospho-site mutants affect BIK1 stability or XLG2-BIK1 interaction. When expressed in protoplasts isolated from <i>xlg2 xlg3</i> plants, the phospho-site mutants allowed similar BIK1-HA accumulation compared to protoplasts expressing the WT XLG2 protein (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These mutants also showed normal interaction with BIK1 in the absence of flg22 and normal dissociation from BIK1 in the presence of flg22. The results suggest that the phosphorylation of these sites affected neither BIK1 stability nor interaction with BIK1. Because XLG2 dissociates from BIK1 following activation by flg22 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), we reasoned that XLG2 may have additional effectors. Indeed, XLG2 interacted strongly with RbohD in Arabidopsis plants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>) and <i>Nb</i> plants (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), providing an explanation that XLG2 phosphorylation regulates ROS burst independent of BIK1 stability. The XLG2-RbohD interaction was detected in the absence of flg22 treatment, indicating that the XLG2 constitutively interacts with RbohD."

The heterotrimeric G proteins regulate FLS2-mediated immunity through at least two mechanisms. Before activation, XLG2/3, AGB1, and AGG1/2 positively regulate BIK1 stability by attenuating proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1. Upon activation of the FLS2-BIK1 complex by flg22, BIK1 directly phosphorylates XLG2 in the N terminus to regulate flg22-induced ROS production, likely through the XLG2-RbohD interaction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

GPA1 and AGG1/2 have been shown to interact with BAK1 and CERK1 in yeast two-hybrid and Bi-Fluorescence Complementation assays, although the biological significance of this remains unknown (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aranda-Sicilia et al., 2015</a>).

The interaction between XLG2/3 and AGB1, which leads to the formation of XLG2/3-AGB1-AGG1/2 heterotrimers (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maruta et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chakravorty et al., 2015</a>), is dynamically regulated by flg22. The flg22-induced dissociation of XLG2 from AGB1 likely reflects an increase of GTP-bound form of G\u03b1 which dissociates from the G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer upon receptor activation. Secondly, the interactions of the G proteins with FLS2 and BIK1 are also dynamically regulated by flg22. The flg22-induced dissociation of the G proteins from BIK1 coincides with the flg22-induced BIK1 phosphorylation, suggesting that the flg22-induced BIK1 phosphorylation triggers the dissociation of the G proteins. Indeed, de-phosphorylation of BIK1 strongly enhanced its interactions with both XLG2 and AGB1 in vitro. The decoupling of the G proteins from the receptor maybe necessary for the regulation of down-stream effectors."

Our genetic analyses indicated that XLG2, AGB1 and AGG1/2 are required for BIK1 stability in the pre-activation state. Loss of <i>XLG2</i> and <i>AGB1</i> leads to accelerated degradation of BIK1, and this is blocked by the addition of proteasome inhibitors, indicating that the G proteins attenuating the proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1. FLS2 is also subject to proteasome-dependent degradation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lu et al., 2011</a>). However, FLS2 accumulation is not affected by the <i>agb1</i> mutation, indicating that the G proteins do not generally regulate proteasome-mediated protein degradation. These observations raise an interesting question as to whether the G proteins specifically impede the ubiquitination of BIK1 or loading of BIK1 to proteasome. Importantly, introduction of a transgenic copy of BIK1 largely restored flg22-triggered immune responses and disease resistance in <i>xlg2</i> and <i>agb1</i> mutants, demonstrating that a major function of the heterotrimeric G protein is to maintain the signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex in the pre-activation state."

This phosphorylation is likely caused by the BIK1 family kinases, as two of the major phosphor-sites induced by flg22 are also phosphorylated by BIK1 in vitro. Non-phosphorylatable XLG2 mutants are compromised in flg22-induced ROS production and disease resistance to <i>Pst</i>, indicating that the phosphorylation plays a positive role. However, mutations in the phospho-sites did not affect XLG2-BIK1 interaction nor BIK1 stability, suggesting that the phosphorylated XLG2 regulates components other than BIK1. Indeed, XLG2 constitutively interacts with RbohD, suggesting that the phosphorylated XLG2 further enhances ROS production by modulating RbohD. RbohD is known to be subject to multiple regulations including phosphorylation by CPK5 and BIK1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dubiella et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kadota et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Li et al., 2014</a>) and calcium binding to EF-hand (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ogasawara et al., 2008</a>).

So a phosphorylated XLG2 may alter RbohD activity through a phosphorylation-induced conformational change or by recruiting other components. At this point, we do not know the real answer and will have to keep it vague. Nonetheless, we have clarified our results to state that the interaction is constitutive (at the end of the Results section and in the subsection \u201cFlg22-induced phosphorylation in XLG2 is required for optimum ROS production and Pst resistance\u201d) and that the mechanism by which the phosphorylated XLG2 regulate RbohD activity remains unknown (in the aforementioned subsection). Phospho-mimicking form of XLG2 showed identical phenotypes as did WT plants. This is likely because XLG2 effectors, such as RbohD, are regulated by multiple signal input. The phosphorylation of XLG2, while necessary, is not sufficient for the activation of RbohD. This point has been clearly stated in the text (subsections \u201cXLG2 phosphorylation is required for disease resistance to Pst and optimum ROS production upon flg22 induction \u201cand \u201cFlg22-induced phosphorylation in XLG2 is required for optimum ROS production and Pst resistance\u201c)."
