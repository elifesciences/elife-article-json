                    "text": "The hemispheric, bi-layered optic cup forms from an oval optic vesicle during early vertebrate eye development through major morphological transformations. The overall basal surface, facing the developing lens, is increasing, while, at the same time, the space basally occupied by individual cells is decreasing. This cannot be explained by the classical view of eye development. Using zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) as a model, we show that the lens-averted epithelium functions as a reservoir that contributes to the growing neuroretina through epithelial flow around the distal rims of the optic cup. We propose that this flow couples morphogenesis and retinal determination. Our 4D data indicate that future stem cells flow from their origin in the lens-averted domain of the optic vesicle to their destination in the ciliary marginal zone. BMP-mediated inhibition of the flow results in ectopic neuroretina in the RPE domain. Ultimately the ventral fissure fails to close resulting in coloboma."

The overall basal surface, facing the developing lens, is increasing, while, at the same time, the space basally occupied by individual cells is decreasing. This cannot be explained by the classical view of eye development. Using zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) as a model, we show that the lens-averted epithelium functions as a reservoir that contributes to the growing neuroretina through epithelial flow around the distal rims of the optic cup. We propose that this flow couples morphogenesis and retinal determination. Our 4D data indicate that future stem cells flow from their origin in the lens-averted domain of the optic vesicle to their destination in the ciliary marginal zone. BMP-mediated inhibition of the flow results in ectopic neuroretina in the RPE domain. Ultimately the ventral fissure fails to close resulting in coloboma."

In teleosts, this process is driven by a migration of single cells that undergo a subsequent intercalation into the epithelium of the expanding optic vesicle (<a href=\"#bib29\">Rembold et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">England et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">Sinn and Wittbrodt, 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">Ivanovitch et al., 2013</a>). The oval optic vesicle develops into a hemispheric bi-layered optic cup through a process that involves major morphological transformations. A long-held view of this process proposes that the lens-averted epithelium of the optic vesicle differentiates into the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), while the epithelium facing the lens gives rise to the neuroretina, which subsequently bends around the developing lens (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chow and Lang, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fuhrmann, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Walls, 1942</a>). This neuroepithelial bending is driven by a basal constriction of lens-facing retinal progenitor cells (RPC) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bogdanovi\u0107 et al., 2012</a>), which ultimately reduces the space occupied by an individual RPC at the basal surface. However, we observed that this is accompanied by a 4.7-fold increase in the overall basal optic cup surface area (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). To identify the cellular origin of this massive increase, we performed in vivo time-lapse microscopy in zebrafish at the corresponding stages, starting at 16.5 hpf (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013L</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), in a transgenic line expressing a membrane-coupled GFP in retinal stem and progenitor cells (Rx2::GFPcaax)."

The majority of the lens-averted epithelium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,G</a>, between arrowheads) serves as a neuro-epithelial reservoir, which eventually is fully integrated into the lens-facing neuro-epithelium (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

This epithelial flow is independent of cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>) as demonstrated by aphidicolin treatment.

As optic cup formation proceeds, this region flattens, enlarges, exhibits the morphological characteristics of RPE, and eventually ceases expressing RX2, a marker for retinal stem and early progenitor cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, asterisks, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>, in between arrows)."

We found, concomitant with lens formation, a prominent epithelial flow around the temporal perimeter of the forming optic cup. An involution of cells from the domain of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) into the domain of the neuroretina had been proposed (<a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2000</a>). Such reorganization of the lens-averted and the lens-facing epithelia, affecting the temporal optic cup, has been subsequently described (<a href=\"#bib27\">Picker et al., 2009</a>) and confirmed (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kwan et al., 2012</a>). It was proposed that such \u2018rim movements\u2019 could occur around most of the optic vesicle circumference (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kwan et al., 2012</a>)."

To further address the transformation of the elongated, oval optic vesicle into the hemispheric optic cup, we quantified cellular movements along the dorso-ventral axis. We found that the most prominent movements leading to the extension in the dorsal ventral axis occurred in the ventral domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). A key step in the formation of the ventral neuroretina is the formation of the optic fissure at the ventral pole of the optic vesicle. Lens-averted epithelium flows through this fissure into the forming optic cup to constitute the ventral neuroepithelium (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Taken together, we present a model of optic cup formation, driven by gastrulation-like epithelial flow from the lens-averted into the lens-facing epithelium of the forming optic cup. The epithelium flows in two domains around the temporal and nasal rim, respectively and through the optic fissure of the forming optic cup. Overall, this has far-reaching implications for different aspects of eye development. One is the establishment of the retinal stem cell niche in the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Centanin et al., 2011</a>), the distal rim of the optic cup/retina."

Time-lapse in vivo microscopy revealed that cells in the lens-averted part of the future neuroretina remained in the prospective RPE domain and did not contribute to the optic cup (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6 and 7</a>). This ultimately resulted in an apparently ectopic domain of neuroretina that arose from a morphogenetic failure, rather than from a trans-differentiation of RPE (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Fig. 6\u2014figure supplement 1,2,3</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Videos 8,9,10</a>). The severity of the phenotype correlated well with levels of fsta expression in the optic vesicle and was most prominent in the temporal domain of the optic vesicle. These findings highlight the importance of the modulation of BMP signaling for epithelial fluidity during the transformation from optic vesicle to optic cup. We propose that the repression of BMP signaling is crucial to mobilize the lens-averted retinal epithelium, causing it to flow and eventually constitute the neural retina to a large extent."

After initiation of neuroretinal differentiation in control embryos, the undifferentiated domains are restricted to the un-fused optic fissure margins and the forming CMZ. Both can be visualized by the expression of <i>Rx2</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). The impairment of neuroretinal flow, however, resulted in a mis-organization of the optic fissure. Here, the undifferentiated <i>Rx2</i>-expressing domain was found at the ultimate tip of the lens-averted neuroretinal domain, which failed to flow into the optic cup and persisted in the prospective RPE (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). As a result, the temporal optic fissure margin, in particular, failed to extend into the optic fissure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013E</a>). This also holds true, but to a lesser extent, to the nasal optic fissure margin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). As a result, the two fissure margins cannot converge resulting in a persisting optic fissure, a coloboma. Macroscopically, the pan-ocular expression of BMP4 results in phenotypes including a \u2018Plattauge\u2019 (flat-eye) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>), in which the ventral part of the eye is strongly affected and a milder phenotype (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), in which the ventral retina develops, but with a persisting optic fissure."

This is likely the cause for coloboma (<a href=\"#bib5\">Behesti et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Koshiba-Takeuchi et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">Sasagawa et al., 2002</a>). Our data based on stable BMP4 expression (rx2::BMP4) in the entire optic vesicle, however, conclusively show that early BMP4 exposure arrests neuroepithelial flow, resulting in a morphologically affected ventral retina. The ventral expression of vax2 in optic cups of rx2::BMP4 embryos indicates the maintenance of ventral retinal fates and argues against early transdifferentiation/dorsalization induced by BMP (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Remarkably, the remaining lens-averted domain of those embryos, which was ectopically localized and was not integrated into the optic cup, eventually differentiated into neuroretina (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), as indicated by the expression of vsx1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kimura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Shi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Vitorino et al., 2009</a>) and vsx2 (formerly Chx10) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Vitorino et al., 2009</a>).

Our data have far-reaching implications on the generation of the retinal stem cell niche of teleosts, as the last cells flowing into the optic cup will eventually constitute the CMZ. We identify a part of the lens-averted epithelium as the primary source of the RPE. The arrest of neuroepithelial flow by the \u2018antimotogenic\u2019 effect of BMP (<a href=\"#bib38\">Veerkamp et al., 2013</a>) results in coloboma and thus highlights the importance of the flow through the fissure for the establishment of the ventral optic cup."

Consequently, forces established outside the neuroretina are likely to drive the flow. One tissue potentially involved is the mono-layered-forming RPE. We speculate that this tissue contributes to the flow by changing its shape from a columnar to a flat epithelium, massively enlarging its surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J\u2013K</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). This remains an interesting point, in particular given that epithelial flow is maintained even if cell proliferation is inhibited in both neuroretina and RPE."

Only tracks with a significant length were used for the visualizations. Centered on the track cells are represented as spheres. Partially results are presented in a side view where the dorso-ventral axis originally represented as the z-axis has now become the y-axis. A factor of 10.5703 is introduced in order to adjust the data of the former z-axis to the other two axes. The color coding is done by choosing colors from an 8 bit lookup table and applying them from the dorsal to the ventral side based on the end of the track. Partially tracking results are presented as tailed spheres. The spheres are based on the tracking data using an average over the last three timepoints. The image is stretched in the z-axis using a factor of 10.5703, to adjust the scale to the x and y axes. Tails are created using a lookup table with 16 different shades per color. The respective shade is defined by the distance and difference in time between the recent position and the position on the tail."

A later stage in situ showing vax2 expression following BMP overexpression should also be shown.

The authors demonstrate that much of the retina derives from lens-averted epithelium, which moves round and into the lens-adjacent layer in directed movements of the cell sheet akin to gastrulation. These movements continue in the absence of cell proliferation, and account for the apparently paradoxical increase in surface area of the neuroretina, despite the decrease in apical surface area of individual cells in this tissue. It is proposed that a small patch of the lens-averted epithelium gives rise to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE)."

The retina specific homeobox transcriptions factor Rx2 in fact represents a marker for retinal stem cells at the relevant stages of the manuscript (see attached manuscript by Reinhardt, Centanin et al., submitted elsewhere). It is initially expressed in all cells of the evaginated optic vesicle (likely stem cells) and as development proceeds is limited to the CMZ. At later stages (once the retinal cell types enter terminal differentiation after the completion of optic cup formation) its expression is additionally found in M\u00fcller Glia cells and photoreceptors. The stem cells of the neuroretina and the Retinal Pigmented Epithelium (RPE) are located within the CMZ. Using an inducible CRE based lineage analysis we show in the accompanying manuscript that Rx2 cells of the CMZ represent stem cells. An individual Rx2 positive cell is multipotent and gives rise to all retinal cell types (Reinhardt, Centanin et al., submitted). This is now explicitly stated in the revised version of the manuscript where we refer to rx2 as retinal stem cell marker. The submitted manuscript of Reinhardt, Centanin et al. has been attached."

Notably the BMP signaling reporter shows a delay of activity, which can be explained by its nature as a transcriptional reporter. This suggests that BMP signaling still is active. This is in favour of a modulative action of the BMP antagonists rather than a total block. We thank the referees for this comment."
