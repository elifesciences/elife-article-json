However, little is known about when and how individual endothelial cell (EC) responds to angiogenic inputs in vivo. Here, we visualized endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in zebrafish and found that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occurred in ECs exhibiting angiogenic behavior. Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations depended upon Vegfr2 and Vegfr3 in ECs budding from the dorsal aorta (DA) and posterior cardinal vein, respectively. Thus, visualizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations allowed us to monitor EC responses to angiogenic cues. Vegfr-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occurred in migrating tip cells as well as stalk cells budding from the DA. We investigated how Dll4/Notch signaling regulates endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and found that it was required for the selection of single stalk cell as well as tip cell. Thus, we captured spatio-temporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during sprouting angiogenesis, as a result of cellular responses to angiogenic inputs."
