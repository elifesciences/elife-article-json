However, it appears that the distribution of blood capillaries largely ignores these functional boundaries. Here we report that, by contrast, astrocytes, a major player in blood-flow control, show a striking morphological sensitivity to functional borders. Specifically, we show that astrocyte processes are structurally confined by barrel boundaries in the mouse, by the border of primary auditory cortex in the rat and by layers IIIa/b and Cytochrome Oxidase (CO)-blobs boundaries in the human primary visual cortex. Thus, astrocytes which are critical elements in neuro-hemodynamic coupling show a significant anatomical segregation along functional boundaries across different mammalian species. These results may open a new anatomical marker for delineating functional borders across species, including post-mortem human brains."

However, it appears that the distribution of blood capillaries largely ignores these functional boundaries. Here we report that, by contrast, astrocytes, a major player in blood-flow control, show a striking morphological sensitivity to functional borders. Specifically, we show that astrocyte processes are structurally confined by barrel boundaries in the mouse, by the border of primary auditory cortex in the rat and by layers IIIa/b and Cytochrome Oxidase (CO)-blobs boundaries in the human primary visual cortex. Thus, astrocytes which are critical elements in neuro-hemodynamic coupling show a significant anatomical segregation along functional boundaries across different mammalian species. These results may open a new anatomical marker for delineating functional borders across species, including post-mortem human brains."

In particular, blood flow modulations have been used to demarcate functional columnar boundaries (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blasdel and Salama, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Grinvald et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lieke et al., 1989</a>). A particularly striking example of such modulation has been found across the boundaries of the rodent's vibrissae related 'barrels' (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cox et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Derdikman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Petersen and Sakmann, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Woolsey et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yang et al., 1997</a>). Given the tight coupling between columnar neuronal activation and blood flow, one could envision that the cortical vascular architecture should show anatomical shaping according to these boundaries. Such structural confinements by columnar boundaries were previously demonstrated in the dendritic and axonal arbors of barrel field neurons. These dendrites and axons appear to be 'repulsed' as they approach the barrel's boundary (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brecht and Sakmann, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lendvai et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Petersen and Sakmann, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shepherd et al., 2005</a>). However, detailed analysis of the micro-vascular organization in rodent barrel fields has failed to reveal such structural barrel-related modifications in the vascular capillary bed (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blinder et al., 2013</a>). Similar failure of anatomical confinement was additionally reported in the primate visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2015</a>), including human cytochrome oxidase blobs evident in layers 2\u20133 of striate cortex, which constitute a robust example of functional 'mosaics' in the primate striate (<a href=\"#bib25\">Livingstone and Hubel, 1984</a>). While the capillaries are a critical component in controlling blood circulation, another major constituent that is hypothesized to play a crucial role in the coupling between neurons and blood flow are glial cells, particularly astrocytes. These cells provide a crucial bridge between neuronal activity and vascular blood circulation. The basic concept is that astrocyte branches are capable of sensing the level of neuronal synaptic communications, integrate this information and then transmit it to the blood vessels, with which they are in contact. It has previously been proposed that signals related to neuronal activity levels can control the capillary\u2019s diameter through astrocytes in this manner (<a href=\"#bib3\">Attwell et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Haydon and Carmignoto, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Petzold and Murthy, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Takano et al., 2006</a>). Importantly the role of astrocytes in blood flow control has recently been demonstrated using Ca<sup>2</sup>+ imaging (<a href=\"#bib36\">Otsu et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, this research emphasized the importance of astrocytes' processes in blood flow control. Indeed, such control can be exquisitely precise, reaching sub-millimeter resolution (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fukuda et al., 2005</a>)."

Indeed, in the case of olfactory bulb glomeruli were neuronal connectivity is highly ordered, dye coupling experiments highlight a preferential communication between astrocytes within glomeruli but not between astrocytes in adjacent glomeruli (<a href=\"#bib44\">Roux et al., 2011</a>). To examine this hypothesis, we stained the entire astrocyte population in three species (mouse, rat and human) and in four functional boundaries (barrel field, auditory cortex, layer IIIa/b and Blob-interblob of human striate cortex), using an immunohistochemical procedure on thin paraffin sections. Superimposing the astrocytes onto the functional boundaries revealed a significant structural relationship. Thus, astrocyte processes showed a significant anatomical confinement at the functional boundaries. This finding raises the possibility\u00a0of using such astrocyte formations as an anatomical marker for the identification of functional boundaries across different cortical areas and species, including post-mortem human tissue."

To examine how general this phenomenon is, we examined the density of astrocyte processes in the auditory cortex of the rat. The analysis was based on 82 \u00b1 9 measurements on 4 neighbored sections (the interval between sections was about 20 \u00b5m) conducted in the left hemispheres of 4 rats (sectioned at Layer IV). For convenience, we will refer to all the secondary fields around A1 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Polley et al., 2007</a>) as A2. The border of A1/A2 was defined by dark field illumination, the results of which are depicted in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. To examine the density of astrocyte processes in the A1 vs. A2 cortex, we obtained ten bands 25 \u00b5m wide and 100 \u00b5m long, their centers located at the borders between A1/A2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, middle). Quantitative measurement of their density was taken along each pixel of the bands (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> right). In addition, we plotted straight lines (50 \u00b5m length), which were superimposed at a distance of 50 and 200 \u00b5m from the border of A1/A2 on both sides, aligned with the border's orientation. These A1 and A2 lines were then superimposed on the corresponding drawings of the astrocyte processes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and G</a>) and the number of astrocyte branch crossings were calculated."

Thus, examining the density of astrocyte processes may offer a novel 'window' into functional boundaries that may be revealed even in post-mortem tissue. To explore the possible extension of our hypothesis to the human cortex, we examined the boundaries of sub-laminae IIIa/IIIb of human primary visual cortex V1. Previous research has uncovered functional distinctions between these two sub-layers in the primate cortex (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sceniak et al., 2001</a>). We analyzed coronal sections from the right hemisphere of one human post-mortem brain (age 35). <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> depicts the orientation of the sections relative to the occipital pole. To reveal the IIIa/IIIb border we used non-phosphorylated neurofilament (NPNF) immunostaining (<a href=\"#bib8\">Campbell and Morrison, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Preuss et al., 1999</a>) and related this border to inter-laminar astrocyte processes (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Astrocyte processes were not uniformly spread in layer III, but appeared to be constrained by the border of IIIa/IIIb. To quantitatively examine this effect, we manually drew the distribution of astrocyte processes at high magnification (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Measuring the density of astrocyte processes between the two sublayers revealed a dramatic and sharp reduction in the density (66 \u00b1 4%) at the border of layer IIIb (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, left). The number of astrocyte branches crossing straight lines (375 \u00b5m length, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) at both sides of the border was also calculated in 4 neighboring sections (interval of about 20 \u00b5m between sections, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, right). There were no differences between the crossings of astrocyte processes in the same sub laminar layer at different distances (50 and 200 \u00b5m) from the border; 27.2 \u00b1 1.15 vs 28.5 \u00b1 1.07 for IIIa (t<sub>68\u00a0</sub>=\u00a01.66, p=0.10) and 13.3 \u00b1 0.54 <i>vs</i> 12.4 \u00b1 1.37 for IIIb (t<sub>62\u00a0</sub>=\u00a01.18, p=0.24). However, a highly significant change was found in the number of crossings when comparing the two sub-laminar areas at similar distances from the borders; 27.2 \u00b1 1.15 <i>vs</i> 13.3 \u00b1 0.54, t<sub>66\u00a0</sub>=\u00a022.39, p&lt;0.001, 50 \u00b5m, and 28.5 \u00b1 1.07 <i>vs</i> 12.4 \u00b1 1.37, t<sub>68\u00a0</sub>=\u00a018.44, p&lt;0.001, 200 \u00b5m from the border, indicating an abrupt change in astrocyte crossing at the sublaminar border."

However, an interesting issue is whether the density of astrocytes significantly changes as one moves from the CO-blob into the inter-blob regions. To examine this question, we mapped neighboring sections (about 100\u00a0\u00b5m apart) of human post-mortem tissue with both the CO-blob locations, defined through CO histochemistry (15\u00a0\u00b5m thick sections) and the astrocyte distribution through immunohistochemistry for GFAP.

Importantly, a significant, albeit smaller decrease in border crossing was observed in these layers as well.

Thus, determining the septa and core boundaries could be achieved with great accuracy. By contrast, defining barrel borders outside layer IV was less accurate, relying on vertical extrapolations from layer IV borders by alignment of some of the penetrating arterioles. Such extrapolation may have introduced some inaccuracies in our border delineations. Therefore, the estimates of border crossings in the upper and lower layers should be considered less accurate compared to our layer IV results."

Compatible with this suggestion, optical imaging of blood flow during vibrissae activation reflects a clear confinement of blood supply within the barrel's borders (<a href=\"#bib11\">Derdikman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Woolsey et al., 1996</a>). Indeed, as has been thoroughly examined in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blinder et al., 2013</a>), it appears that the highly localized functional selectivity reflected in intrinsic optical imaging is likely due to direct and localized modulation at the level of the microvessels, while more pathological blockage of penetrating arterioles and venules can lead to a more wide-spread vascular effects."

If, indeed such confinement serves an adaptive role, an interesting possibility is that this anatomical confinement reflects a dynamic plasticity process. In such a process, the distribution of astrocyte processes may reflect the level of sustained co-activation across neighboring neuronal assemblies, analogous to a Hebbian learning process. Relevant to this hypothesis, previous research has demonstrated activity-dependent dynamic changes in the coupling between astrocyte processes in the case of olfactory glomeruli (<a href=\"#bib44\">Roux et al., 2011</a>). It is noteworthy that this hypothesis reverses the causal chain. We do not propose that the morphological shaping of astrocytes somehow endows the underlying tissue with its functional boundaries. Rather, we hypothesize that the astrocyte processes are shaped by the functional selectivity of the underlying neuronal population. Finally, one cannot rule out a more interactive shaping, in which both systems remodel each other."

However, despite these striking differences, our results revealed such confinement in all three systems, including human cortex. It will be interesting to examine whether similar anatomical astrocyte confinements can be observed in other well defined functional boundaries, and the parameters that determine the level of astrocyte confinement in different systems. Our demonstration that astrocyte density modulation can be revealed in micro-structures in human V1 opens the exciting possibility that the non-homogeneity in astrocyte spread could be employed as a new marker for additional areal, columnar and functional discontinuities in the human brain. This is particularly important since the currently available information about such functional boundaries in post-mortem brain tissue is confined to more basic anatomical and histological aspects (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lorenz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zilles and Amunts, 2010</a>)."

An attractive hypothesis, suggested by the present results, could be that long term and habitual confinement of neuronal activation to specific functional domains may have gradually adapted the individual astrocyte arbor domains to the neuronal functional boundaries in parallel with the dendritic and axonal confinement.\""
