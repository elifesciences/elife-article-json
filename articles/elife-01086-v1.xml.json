CCR2<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes (IMs) have been implicated in Mtb-specific CD4 T cell responses but their in vivo contribution remains unresolved. Herein, we show that transient ablation of IMs during infection prevents Mtb delivery to pulmonary lymph nodes, reducing CD4 T cell responses. Transfer of MHC class II-expressing IMs to MHC class II-deficient, monocyte-depleted recipients, while restoring Mtb transport to mLNs, does not enable Mtb-specific CD4 T cell priming. On the other hand, transfer of MHC class II-deficient IMs corrects CD4 T cell priming in monocyte-depleted, MHC class II-expressing mice. Specific depletion of classical DCs does not reduce Mtb delivery to pulmonary lymph nodes but markedly reduces CD4 T cell priming. Thus, although IMs acquire characteristics of DCs while delivering Mtb to lymph nodes, cDCs but not moDCs induce proliferation of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells."

CCR2<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes (IMs) have been implicated in Mtb-specific CD4 T cell responses but their in vivo contribution remains unresolved. Herein, we show that transient ablation of IMs during infection prevents Mtb delivery to pulmonary lymph nodes, reducing CD4 T cell responses. Transfer of MHC class II-expressing IMs to MHC class II-deficient, monocyte-depleted recipients, while restoring Mtb transport to mLNs, does not enable Mtb-specific CD4 T cell priming. On the other hand, transfer of MHC class II-deficient IMs corrects CD4 T cell priming in monocyte-depleted, MHC class II-expressing mice. Specific depletion of classical DCs does not reduce Mtb delivery to pulmonary lymph nodes but markedly reduces CD4 T cell priming. Thus, although IMs acquire characteristics of DCs while delivering Mtb to lymph nodes, cDCs but not moDCs induce proliferation of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells."

It is caused by mycobacteria, notably <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, and the World Health Organization estimates that about one third of the world\u2019s population has latent tuberculosis, although only one person in 10 goes on to develop an active infection. Understanding why some individuals develop active infections, whereas most do not, could help with the development of a vaccine to prevent tuberculosis and/or new treatments for the disease. Disappointing results from vaccine trials and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis have increased the need for more research into the interactions between mycobacteria and the human immune system."

When <i>M. tuberculosis</i> first enters the human respiratory tract, the innate immune system tries to identify and destroy cells that have been infected. However, if this initial response is not effective, the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> can persist in the lungs and trigger the adaptive immune response. This involves CD4 T cells working to eliminate the infection, but our understanding of the adaptive immune response is not complete."

These monocytes develop many of the characteristics of dendritic cells, but they do not activate the CD4 T cells."

Without the dendritic cells, however, fewer CD4 T cell are primed in the lymph nodes. Samstein et al. suggest that the inflammatory monocytes play a crucial role by transporting the live bacteria to the lymph nodes. And once in the lymph nodes, the monocytes transfer invading antigens to dendritic cells to initiate the production of the CD4 T cells to lead the fight against the infection."

Although IMs make important contributions to innate immune defense during infection, recent studies also implicate IMs in priming of CD4 T cell responses during fungal, viral and parasitic infections (<a href=\"#bib22\">Traynor et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Leon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Edismo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Hohl et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Rivera et al., 2011</a>). Experiments using CCR2-deficient mice also suggested that monocytes contribute to T-cell-mediated defense against Mtb. IMs, however, can also serve as permissive host cells for Mtb in later stages of infection, suggesting that IMs can both restrict and enhance Mtb infection (<a href=\"#bib1\">Antonelli et al., 2010</a>). Because recruitment of IMs in CCR2-deficient mice is defective throughout early, intermediate and late stages of infection, it has not been possible to specifically define the role of monocytes at different times during infection (<a href=\"#bib16\">Peters et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Scott and Flynn, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Peters et al., 2004</a>). Therefore, we used CCR2-DTR mice to transiently deplete IMs and other CCR2-expressing cells during discrete stages of Mtb infection."

Previous studies have demonstrated that CD4 T-cell priming occurs approximately 7\u201310 days following inhalational challenge (<a href=\"#bib24\">Wolf et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Gallegos et al., 2008</a>). Depletion of CCR2-expressing cells 7, 9 and 11 days following infection resulted in a threefold increase in the number of live Mtb in the lungs on day 15 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To further investigate this finding, we depleted monocytes 7\u201311 days following infection and quantitatively cultured Mtb from lungs and lymph nodes 12 days following infection.

C7 T cells had proliferated in mLNs of control mice 12 days after infection but had not expanded in monocyte-depleted mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>).

This strategy did not require antibody staining for trafficking molecules (CCR2 and CD11b) and eliminated NK cells, CD4 T cells, dendritic cell progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells, yielding a highly purified (&gt;99% pure) population of IMs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To determine whether CCR2 is required for trafficking to lungs and mLNs during Mtb infection, we purified IMs from CCR2-deficient, CCR2-GFP mice for adoptive transfer into Mtb-infected, CCR2-DTR recipient mice that were monocyte depleted between 7 and 11 days following infection. Quantitative culture 12 days following Mtb infection demonstrated that wild-type and CCR2-deficient IMs were equivalent at delivering Mtb to mLNs, indicating that CCR2-signaling does not contribute to trafficking of IMs between these sites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>)."

Adoptively transferred IMs trafficked to mLNs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and, as demonstrated in the previous experiments, corrected Mtb delivery to draining lymph nodes to levels seen in mice that had not been monocyte-depleted (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, defective antigen transport to the draining mLN could not explain the lack of CD4 T cell proliferation. In a reciprocal experiment, we transferred MHC class II-deficient IMs into Mtb-infected, MHC class II-expressing CCR2-DTR mice on the same schedule described above and quantified the C7 T cell response. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> demonstrates that the magnitude of the C7 T cell response was similar in monocyte-depleted mice rescued with either MHC class II-expressing or deficient monocytes.

We transferred C7 T cells into zDC-DTR mice, infected the mice with Mtb and administered DT on days 7\u201311 following infection. Depletion of classical DCs resulted in markedly reduced C7 T cell expansion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) but did not reduce the number of live Mtb in mLNs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). FLT3L-deficient mice, which lack classical DCs but not IMs, also have markedly reduced CD4 T cell responses following Mtb infection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) despite the presence of Mtb in the mLN (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results indicate that classical DCs, while dispensable for trafficking of live Mtb from infected lungs to mLNs, are essential for CD4 T cell priming."

Our results extend previous reports that IMs influence CD4 T cell priming (<a href=\"#bib11\">Leon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Hohl et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Nakano et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Rivera et al., 2011</a>) by demonstrating that IMs serve as transporters of live bacteria from the site of infection to the site of T cell priming."

Why IMs fail to prime DCs in this setting remains unclear. Evidence that moDCs generated in vitro can stimulate T cell responses suggests that IMs can process and present antigen (<a href=\"#bib19\">Schreurs et al., 1999</a>). Recovery of several hundred adoptively transferred IMs from the mLNs of infected mice also suggests that sufficient numbers of IM were present to prime T cells. One possible explanation is that IMs, by virtue of being infected with Mtb, are ineffective at stimulating Mtb-specific lymphocytes, in contrast to resident dendritic cells that have not been infected (<a href=\"#bib24\">Wolf et al., 2007</a>)."

Other studies characterizing CD8 T cell responses to cutaneous viral infection have demonstrated a role for CD103+ DCs in transport and priming with potential contributions by inflammatory monocytes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bedoui et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Edismo et al., 2009</a>). One previous study has suggested that IMs carry fungal antigens from a site of cutaneous inoculation to draining LNs and transfer antigens to LN resident DCs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ersland et al., 2010</a>). Our study extends this finding to live pulmonary infection with Mtb. IMs transport bacteria to lymph nodes and transfer antigen to classical dendritic cells prior to CD4 T cell priming."

It is possible that cross-dressing (<a href=\"#bib23\">Wakim et al., 2011</a>), in which infected cells pass MHC molecules to uninfected cells, plays a role during Mtb infection. We did not detect transfer of MHC class II molecules from host cells to adoptively transferred, MHC class II-deficient monocytes. The number of MHC/peptide complexes required per APC to stimulate T cell responses, however, may be very small and below our level of detection. That said, given our finding that MHC class II-deficient IMs effectively complemented monocyte-depleted, MHC class II sufficient mice while MHC class II-expressing monocytes could not correct deficient T cell priming in MHC class II-deficient, monocyte-depleted mice, we believe that transfer of MHC class II molecules in either direction plays a minimal role in T cell priming during Mtb infection. Future studies will determine whether live Mtb are transferred to classical DCs, or whether transfer principally involves the movement of processed or unprocessed proteins from infected monocytes to uninfected DCs."

It would be interesting if the authors could provide insights on why the monocytes that carry Mtb to lymph nodes do not present antigen to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Is there a problem with their localization within lymph nodes? Or are they incompetent for antigen processing and presentation (their antigen presentation capacity could be tested ex vivo)? Or are they too few to function as APC and their role is limited to spreading a live organism? In addition the authors may also consider the alternative possibility that resident DCs transfer their MHC class II molecules to inflammatory monocytes (a process related to \u201ccross dressing\u201d). In this case DC depletion would block T cell activation because the source of MHC class II is absent. This possibility could be addressed by asking whether there is any MHC class II on class II KO inflammatory monocytes after adoptive transfer and infection. While these experiments would provide a mechanistic explanation to the results, they are not essential to support the major conclusions of the study and consequently the authors may address these issues in the Discussion."

We have addressed the major issues raised by the review with additional experiments and we have modified the Discussion of our manuscript. As pointed out, the mechanism of antigen transfer between monocytes and resident DCs remains unclear. Many in vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of monocyte-derived DCs to prime T cells, suggesting that IM-derived cells are not intrinsically incapable of antigen processing, presentation or T cell priming. Our ability to detect several hundred adoptively transferred IMs per mLN by flow cytometry suggests that a paucity of these cells is an unlikely explanation for their inability to prime T cells. We believe, and there is published evidence for this from other laboratories, that live Mtb infection interferes with MHC class II antigen processing and presentation. We have inserted statements in the Discussion to address these interesting possible explanations for our findings."

Although we did not find evidence for cross-dressing using this approach, since it is possible that very few MHC molecules are required per cell for T cell priming, we are unable to rule out its contribution. That said, given our finding that MHC class II-deficient IMs effectively complemented monocyte-depleted, MHC class II sufficient mice while MHC class II-expressing monocytes could not correct deficient T cell priming in MHC class II-deficient, monocyte depleted mice, we believe that transfer of MHC class II molecules in either direction plays a minimal role in T cell priming during Mtb infection."
