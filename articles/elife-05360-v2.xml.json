To test whether the coordination of VTA reward prediction error signals with these replayed spatial sequences could contribute to this process, we recorded from neuronal ensembles of the hippocampus and VTA as rats performed appetitive spatial tasks and subsequently slept. We found that many reward responsive (RR) VTA neurons coordinated with quiet wakefulness-associated hippocampal SPW-R events that replayed recent experience. In contrast, coordination between RR neurons and SPW-R events in subsequent slow wave sleep was diminished. Together, these results indicate distinct contributions of VTA reinforcement activity associated with hippocampal spatial replay to the processing of wake and SWS-associated spatial memory."

To test whether the coordination of VTA reward prediction error signals with these replayed spatial sequences could contribute to this process, we recorded from neuronal ensembles of the hippocampus and VTA as rats performed appetitive spatial tasks and subsequently slept. We found that many reward responsive (RR) VTA neurons coordinated with quiet wakefulness-associated hippocampal SPW-R events that replayed recent experience. In contrast, coordination between RR neurons and SPW-R events in subsequent slow wave sleep was diminished. Together, these results indicate distinct contributions of VTA reinforcement activity associated with hippocampal spatial replay to the processing of wake and SWS-associated spatial memory."

Between trials, the activity of VTA neurons that encoded reward-related information coordinated with the hippocampus\u2019 memories of paths through the arena and indicated where in the arena the rats found food rewards. Unexpectedly however, coordination of these VTA neurons with the hippocampus was greatly reduced when the rats were asleep. This observation suggests that waking memories and sleep-associated memories may serve distinct purposes, for example, to aid learning and planning or to stabilize the memories. A key challenge now is to determine these distinct roles."

As animals explore the environment, hippocampal place cells fire sequentially under the modulation of the theta rhythm. Subsequently, these sequences of neuronal activity are replayed in association with hippocampal sharp wave-ripple (SPW-R) events of quiet wakefulness and sleep (<a href=\"#bib27\">O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lee and Wilson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Diba and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2007</a>). SPW-R events contribute to spatial learning (<a href=\"#bib12\">Jadhav et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Girardeau et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2010</a>), and the capacity for reward to influence reactivation of CA3 place cell pairs in SPW-R events (<a href=\"#bib37\">Singer and Frank, 2009</a>)\u00a0suggests that reward-related neural activity is likely to play an important role in this process. It has been unclear whether replay events of quiet wakefulness and sleep differ in their contribution to learning and memory, but the observation that replay events during slow wave sleep (SWS) are lower fidelity than replay events during quiet wakefulness (<a href=\"#bib15\">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</a>)\u00a0supports this possibility."

Optogenetic activation of dopamine cells during spatial learning has recently been demonstrated to increase the reactivation of CA1 place cell pairs in sleep and stabilize subsequent spatial learning (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mcnamara et al., 2014</a>). In addition, electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle triggered on a hippocampal place cell\u2019s spikes has recently been shown to drive goal-directed behavior toward its place field (<a href=\"#bib4\">de Lavill\u00e9on et al., 2015</a>).\u00a0However, it is unclear how under normal physiological conditions dopamine neuronal activity engages with the hippocampus. Dopamine cells could coordinate with and reinforce replayed hippocampal sequences. In addition, the fast-onset, slowly decaying profile of dopamine synaptic release has led to the suggestion that dopamine could implement the propagation of expected value across reactivated hippocampal sequences (<a href=\"#bib8\">Foster and Wilson, 2006</a>). We hypothesized that replayed hippocampal spatial sequences would coordinate with reward-related representations of VTA neurons during tasks that place demands on spatial memory. Here, we acquired simultaneous multi-electrode (tetrode) recordings of neurons of the hippocampus and the VTA as rats performed appetitive spatial tasks and subsequently slept to determine the relationship between VTA neuronal activity, hippocampal SPW-R-associated activity, and sequence replay. We show that many reward responsive (RR) VTA neurons modulate their firing rate with SPW-R events of quiet wakefulness. Modulation of VTA unit activity was greater in SPW-R events associated with hippocampal replay of task-associated sequences. In contrast to nonRR VTA unit activity, RR unit activity preferentially coordinated with replayed representations of reward sites. In addition, RR VTA units more strongly phase-locked to the hippocampal theta rhythm than nonRR units, and RR VTA units that more strongly coupled to hippocampal theta had greater coordination with replayed reward site representations. In contrast to these findings in the awake state, in post-task epochs of SWS, SPW-R modulation of RR VTA unit activity was significantly reduced. Furthermore, within SWS, RR unit activity decreased during periods of hippocampal SPW-R reactivation. Together, these results indicate distinct contributions of VTA reinforcement activity associated with hippocampal spatial replay to the processing of wake and SWS-associated spatial memory."

We therefore explored how VTA unit activity relates to the specific spatial locations contained in replay content. To account for latency between hippocampal SPW-R events and VTA activity, we first examined the hippocampal SPW-R event-triggered VTA LFP. This revealed a prominent negative potential that peaked 84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013 ms after SPW-R onset (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We focused on replay events occurring at forced reward locations, which represent the beginning of choice trials and which comprised the majority of replay events (703/876, 80.3%; compared to 173 at choice reward locations). For each recording, we constructed a distribution of all decoded locations within these replay events and compared this to the distribution of decoded spatial locations specifically associated with 84 ms delayed RR VTA unit spikes and nonRR VTA unit spikes."

Circular concentration of VTA unit spikes around the mean preferred hippocampal theta phase was greater for RR units than nonRR units, as measured with the circular concentration coefficient kappa as described previously (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jones and Wilson, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Siapas et al., 2005</a>), (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.e.m., RR: 0.139\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.012, n = 47; nonRR: 0.099\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.019, n = 24; p<i>=</i>0.03, rank-sum test; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). For theta-modulated RR units but not theta-modulated nonRR units, circular concentration at hippocampal theta positively correlated with the probability that spike-associated replayed spatial content represented reward locations (RR units: r = 0.51, p<i>=</i>0.04, n = 17; nonRR units: r = 0.45, p<i>=</i>0.13, n = 13; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In contrast, the circular concentration coefficient of VTA units at hippocampal theta did not correlate with the firing rate of those units (RR units: r = -0.22, p<i>=</i>0.4, n = 18; nonRR units: r = -0.49, p<i>=</i>0.09, n = 13). In addition, the circular concentration of RR units at hippocampal theta did not correlate with their modulation depth at SPW-R replay events (r = 0.12, p<i>=</i>0.5, n = 45). Thus, phase-locking of RR units to hippocampal theta during run behavior was associated with the timing but not the number of spikes of RR units at SPW-R events."

Each trial consisted of two phases. In the sample phase, rats were directed pseudorandomly to either the left (or right) reward site on the forced side of the maze, where a nosepoke-triggered grain pellet reward could be obtained (MedAssociates (Georgia, VT); Bioserv). In the test phase of the trial, rats traversed the central arm to a choice point, where they chose to go right (or left) in order to win reward on the choice side of the maze. The reward contingency was set up such that if the rat had been forced to turn left in the sample phase, then the correct response in the test phase was to turn right. Individual trajectories between reward sites on forced and choice sides were 300 cm long. After training, the animals were implanted with tetrode arrays. Following recovery from surgery, animals were food deprived to 85% of their free-feeding weights. Animals relearned the task slowly, improving from 60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03% (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.e.m.) performance in the first three days of behavior to 74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% in the final three behavioral sessions.

The best fitting trajectory was selected based on a goodness-of-fit score (\u2018replay score\u2019), computed as the mean posterior probability within 15 cm of the fitted trajectory. To test if fitted trajectories could be expected by chance alignment of position estimates, the replay score for each candidate event was compared to replay score distributions derived with two shuffles of the data, using the approach described in\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Davidson et al., 2009</a>). The first \u2018column cycle shuffle\u2019 controls for the linear alignment of consecutive position estimates by circularly shifting the estimated probability distribution over position (PDF) in each candidate event time bin by a random distance. The second \u2018pseudo-event shuffle\u2019 controls for bias towards particular locations, by constructing artificial candidate events generated by replacing each PDF in a candidate event with a PDF drawn at random from the complete set of candidate events in each session. Each shuffle was performed 1500 times for each candidate event to obtain sample distributions of the replay score. To increase detection sensitivity of possible replay events on the spatial working memory task, we considered replay events to be those with a Monte Carlo p value&lt;0.05 for both shuffles on at least one path. We considered non-replay enriched events those with a p value&gt;0.2 for both shuffles for all four trajectories. For replay content assessments (below), we used a more stringent criterion for replay detection by performing the shuffles for each putative replay event on the one trajectory with the strongest replay score. We obtained similar results using the standard criterion."

We determined the temporal delay between hippocampal SPW-R events and VTA activity on the basis of the delay in the SPW-R event-triggered VTA local field potential (84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013 ms). The distribution of VTA spike-associated replay content was derived by accumulating the spatial probability distribution functions for the subset of 25 ms replay time bins that preceded VTA unit spikes by this fixed delay. The probability of reward site content for each recording was measured as the fraction of the distribution of replayed spatial locations that was associated with reward sites. The probability of VTA units coordinating with reward site content (reward site probability) was measured similarly, as the fraction of the distribution of VTA spike-associated replay content that was associated with reward locations. To compare RR and nonRR VTA spike-associated replay content with overall replay content, we computed a reward site bias as follows: Each replay time bin was assigned a 1 (or 0) when the average representation of reward site regions exceeded (or did not exceed) the average representation of nonreward regions. The same binary metric was applied to each RR and nonRR VTA spike-associated replay time bin. From these measures, we computed across the entire dataset the proportion of VTA spike-associated replay time bins that better represented reward site regions compared to nonreward site regions, and we compared this with the proportion of replay time bins that better represented reward site regions, accounting for differences in the number of spike-associated time bins across RR units and nonRR units across recordings, to derive the excess reward site bias. There were 5422 replay time bins, 2269 RR unit spike-associated bins, and 2455 nonRR unit spike-associated bins. On the SWM task, there were 3554 replay time bins and 1046 RR unit spike-associated bins. On the linear track, there were 1868 replay time bins and 818 RR unit spike-associated bins. The reward site bias was highly correlated with the reward site probability (RR units, r = 0.80, p=1.36\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-4</sup>). To explore the sensitivity of the reward site bias to the temporal delay between replayed spatial content and VTA unit activity, we systematically varied the delay in 25 ms steps. Consistent with the latency of the SPW-R-associated VTA potential, the excess reward site bias of RR units was maximal at a 75 ms VTA lag relative to hippocampal activity (data not shown)."

For each replay event, we transformed the direction index of each time bin into an index of forward or reverse content, as follows. Since we restricted our analysis to replay events occurring while the rat paused at force reward sites, for centrifugal sequence replay away from the animal\u2019s location, outbound content reflects forward replay, while inbound content reflects reverse replay. In contrast, for remotely initiated, centripetal replay towards the animal\u2019s location, inbound content reflects forward replay, while outbound content reflects reverse replay. For centrifugal and centripetal replay content analyses, we aggregated forward and reverse replay event time bins together, defining centrifugal replay events as replay trajectories moving away from the current position of the animal and centripetal replay events as replay trajectories approaching the animal. We compared the reward site bias of centrifugal and centripetal replay event time bins and of forward and reverse replay event time bins to the reward site bias of VTA unit spikes occurring with 84 ms delay to those replay time bins. There were 1700 time bins with centrifugal replay content, of which 681 were associated with RR unit spikes and 770 with nonRR unit spikes. There were 1248 time bins with centripetal replay content, of which 585 were associated with RR unit spikes and 602 with nonRR unit spikes. In addition, there were 1561 time bins with forward replay content, of which 699 were associated with RR unit spikes and 720 with nonRR unit spikes.

For each case, we ran a logistic regression in which we considered each element of the case separately, as well as their interaction. For example, in the first case, we computed a logistic regression to measure the interaction between RR unit-associated reward site bias and replay-associated reward site bias, and nonRR unit-associated reward site bias and replay associated reward site bias. We then compared the interaction term to a distribution of simulated interaction terms assuming the null hypothesis. We considered the reward site bias for replay (A), the reward site bias for RR units (B), and the reward site bias for nonRR units (C). The logistic regression predicted reward site bias as a binary dependent variable (present/absent) with binary predictors of (either B or C = 1 vs A = 0), comparison (B vs A = 1, C vs A = 0), and their interaction, the latter being the predictor pertinent to the research question. Since these hypotheses were in only one direction, we ran 1-tail tests. In order to determine the one tail p value in these nonlinear tests, we performed a nonparametric permutation test of 1,000 iterations of the logistic regression, assuming the null hypothesis (i.e., the coefficient for the interaction is centered at zero). In each iteration, the fraction of reward site bias (A) for each comparison was taken as the overall average of actual estimates separately incremented with a perturbation from a normal distribution. The mean of this distribution was set to 0 and the standard deviation chosen so as to produce simulated interaction regression coefficients with a standard deviation approximately equal to the standard error for the same predictor estimated from the logistic regression of the actual data. The proportion of simulated interaction coefficients greater than or equal to the actual interaction coefficient was taken as the estimated one-tail p value."
