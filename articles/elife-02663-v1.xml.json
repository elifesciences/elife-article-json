We therefore created conditional mouse mutants lacking both GSK-3\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 in newly born cortical excitatory neurons. <i>Gsk3</i>-deleted neurons expressing upper layer markers exhibited striking migration failure in all areas of the cortex. Radial migration in hippocampus was similarly affected. In contrast, tangential migration was not grossly impaired after <i>Gsk3</i> deletion in interneuron precursors. <i>Gsk3</i>-deleted neurons extended axons and developed dendritic arbors. However, the apical dendrite was frequently branched while basal dendrites exhibited abnormal orientation. GSK-3 regulation of migration in neurons was independent of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Importantly, phosphorylation of the migration mediator, DCX, at ser327, and phosphorylation of the semaphorin signaling mediator, CRMP-2, at Thr514 were markedly decreased. Our data demonstrate that GSK-3 signaling is essential for radial migration and dendritic orientation and suggest that GSK-3 mediates these effects by phosphorylating key microtubule regulatory proteins."

We therefore created conditional mouse mutants lacking both GSK-3\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 in newly born cortical excitatory neurons. <i>Gsk3</i>-deleted neurons expressing upper layer markers exhibited striking migration failure in all areas of the cortex. Radial migration in hippocampus was similarly affected. In contrast, tangential migration was not grossly impaired after <i>Gsk3</i> deletion in interneuron precursors. <i>Gsk3</i>-deleted neurons extended axons and developed dendritic arbors. However, the apical dendrite was frequently branched while basal dendrites exhibited abnormal orientation. GSK-3 regulation of migration in neurons was independent of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Importantly, phosphorylation of the migration mediator, DCX, at ser327, and phosphorylation of the semaphorin signaling mediator, CRMP-2, at Thr514 were markedly decreased. Our data demonstrate that GSK-3 signaling is essential for radial migration and dendritic orientation and suggest that GSK-3 mediates these effects by phosphorylating key microtubule regulatory proteins."

The GSK-3 enzyme was already known to modify the activities of many other proteins that affect the migration of cells.

GSK-3s act via mechanisms that include regulation of transcription factors, control of multiple aspects of cellular metabolism, and phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hur and Zhou, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kaidanovich-Beilin and Woodgett, 2011</a>). Most often, although not invariably, GSK-3s function as negatively acting kinases by inhibiting the functions of substrates at baseline. Inhibition is then relieved via signaling pathways that engage GSK-3 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Doble and Woodgett, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kaidanovich-Beilin and Woodgett, 2011</a>).

Multiple in vitro studies have suggested roles for GSK-3 in regulating neuronal polarity and axon growth and branching (see <a href=\"#bib39\">Hur and Zhou, 2010</a> for review). These functions are thought to be mediated via GSK-3 phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) including Collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) (<a href=\"#bib76\">Yoshimura et al., 2005</a>), Adenomatous polypsis coli (APC) (<a href=\"#bib64\">Shi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhou et al., 2004</a>), Tau (<a href=\"#bib67\">Stoothoff and Johnson, 2005</a>), microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Trivedi et al., 2005</a>), Doublecortin (DCX) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bilimoria et al., 2010</a>), and subsequent regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. In general, inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 via serine 9 (ser9) and GSK-3\u03b1 via serine 21 (ser21) phosphorylation and subsequent relief of phosphorylation of downstream targets is thought to be required for the formation of the axon and subsequent axonal growth (<a href=\"#bib43\">Jiang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hur and Zhou, 2010</a>). In a similar vein, a study employing in utero electroporation of an activating construct suggested that GSK-3 inhibition was essential for radial-guided cortical neuronal migration downstream of STK11 (LKB1) via a mechanism involving APC (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asada and Sanada, 2010</a>). A prediction of this work might be that GSK-3 deletion would enhance axon growth and radial migration. However, to date these effects of GSK-3 on neuronal polarity and migration have not been confirmed with mouse genetic studies. Further, mice with point mutation knockins that prevent ser9/21 phosphorylation are viable and have not been reported to show defects in neuronal morphology or migration (<a href=\"#bib52\">McManus et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gartner et al., 2006</a>). Finally, GSK-3 may regulate migration and morphology of cortical neurons via entirely different pathways for example via mediating effects of semaphorin signaling (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Renaud et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Nakamura et al., 2009</a>)."

We demonstrate, surprisingly, that GSK-3 activity is essential for radial neuron migration in all areas of the cortex and in the hippocampus. In contrast, tangential migration is not affected after <i>Gsk3</i> deletion in cortical interneuron precursors. Remarkably, the migration effects appear to be independent of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling that mediates GSK-3 functions in neuronal progenitors. The few upper layer neurons that reached their normal location exhibited strikingly abnormal orientation of basal dendrites. GSK-3 control of migration and morphology is correlated with the regulation of phosphorylation of DCX on ser327 and CRMP-2 on Thr514. We conclude that GSK-3 is a critical regulator of neuronal migration and morphogenesis and that GSK-3 regulation is mediated by phosphorylation of key cytoskeletal proteins."

Many of these migration arrested neurons exhibited abnormal dendritic arbors (data not shown). Because improper laminar position might affect dendritic arborization, we focused analysis on a small subset of <i>Gsk3</i>-deleted neurons that reached layer 2/3. Images at E16 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and E19 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A'</a>) show that a few <i>Gsk3</i>-deleted neurons are normally positioned and suggest that these normally positioned neurons did not undergo a substantial delay in migration. All of the neurons elaborated dendritic arbors and extended an axon into the corpus callosum. However, many of these normally positioned <i>Gsk3</i>-deleted neurons exhibited markedly abnormally oriented basal dendrites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, arrows). In many cases, basal dendrites were oriented towards the pial surface rather than towards the deeper cortical layers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>).

At later stages, recent work has demonstrated that GSK-3 is a key mediator of the amplification of the INP pool via interactions with the scaffolding protein Axin (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fang et al., 2013</a>). Axin-GSK-3 binding in the cytoplasm is clearly required for expansion of the INP pool, although the mechanism of GSK-3 action was not specified in this study.

Additional examples possibly relevant to migration are GSK-3 regulation of FAK phosphorylation at ser722 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bianchi et al., 2005</a>) and dynamin-1 phosphorylation of ser774 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Clayton et al., 2010</a>). GSK-3 phosphorylation regulates functions of these proteins in complex ways, but possibly enhances functions that may be required for neuronal migration."

                                "text": "A well-studied example of a pathway that is associated with upregulation of GSK-3 activity is semaphorin signaling. Semaphorin family members have multiple roles as chemorepellants and chemoattractants for many classes of axons and dendrites (for review see <a href=\"#bib59\">Pasterkamp, 2012</a>). Semaphorin signaling strongly activates GSK-3 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Eickholt et al., 2002</a>) resulting in phosphorylation of a key MAP, CRMP-2 (<a href=\"#bib71\">Uchida et al., 2005</a>), as well as other CRMP family members (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cole et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Yamashita and Goshima, 2012</a>). Intriguingly, during neuronal polarization semaphorin signaling is associated with suppression of axons, and formation of dendrites (<a href=\"#bib63\">Shelly et al., 2011</a>), consistent with the idea that dephosphorylated CRMP-2 may favor axon formation, whereas phosphorylated CRMP-2 may be critical to proper formation of dendritic arbors."

                                "text": "Importantly, migration and dendritic abnormalities that we have described here are consistent with cortical neuron phenotypes reported due to manipulation of semaphorin and CRMP signaling. Interfering with semaphorin, NP1 or Plexin via silencing RNAs and gene knockouts has been reported to interfere with radial migration (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Renaud et al., 2008</a>). Application of exogenous semaphorin supports apical process formation (<a href=\"#bib61\">Polleux et al., 2000</a>). Further, reduced semaphorin signaling causes bifurcation of CA1 pyramidal dendrites in the developing hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nakamura et al., 2009</a>). Downstream of semaphorins, interfering with CRMP functions has been reported to affect migration and result in branched apical dendrites and abnormal dendrite orientation (<a href=\"#bib75\">Yamashita et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Yamashita and Goshima, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ip et al., 2012</a>; for a review see, <a href=\"#bib40\">Ip et al., 2014</a>). Finally, in the context of cortical neuronal migration, phosphorylation of CRMP-2 promotes migration. Thus a GSK-3 phosphomimetic CRMP-2 can rescue migration defects associated with knockdown of the semaphorin signaling mediator, \u03b12-chimaerin (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ip et al., 2012</a>). Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibition of CRMP2 phosphorylation at Thr514 in <i>Gsk3</i>-deleted neurons may partially explain the migration and dendritic orientation abnormalities we have observed."

In particular, we do not find evidence that an STK11(LKB1)/GSK-3 inhibitory pathway is a key migration regulator. In contrast, our results are consistent with the idea GSK-3 phosphorylation of DCX and CRMP-2 is required for appropriate cytoskeletal regulation and migration. Finally, our data are consistent with the idea that GSK-3 activity is essential for the effects of semaphorin and CRMP-2 signaling on cortical neuronal development in vivo."

Since these neurons are born quite a bit earlier, are the authors confident that their driver line Nex-Cre actually causes recombination early enough to affect these earlier-born neurons? Also, most Tbr1-positive neurons are generated directly by radial glia, while the Cux1-positive neurons are largely generated via intermediate progenitors. Since intermediate progenitors are targeted by their Nex-Cre construct, might this provide an explanation for these differences?"

The authors need to deemphasize their conclusions that these are direct effects unless they have data dissociating migration from later events such as dendritic development."

Since many of the molecules implicated in this process are major players in important intracellular signalling events, this question is of considerable interest to a general audience. Specifically, the manuscript focuses on the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics in migrating posmitotic neurons in the vertebrate cortex, and the role of LKB1, GSK-3 and APC signalling cascade. These proteins have been previously implicated in neuronal migration in a study using non-genetic and acute manipulations (Asada, N. &amp; Sanada, 2010)."

Tangential neuronal migration in GSK-3 mutants is not affected suggesting that it GSK-3 is specifically involved in radial migration. Cell-autonomous deletion of GSK-3 reproduced the migration defect and revealed a neuronal morphology defect (the authors argue for dendrite orientation defects), as well as the persistence of the migration defects in postnatal animals. Next, the authors used Nex:cre to delete beta catenin, disheveled, LKB1, CDC42 and Pten, and show no effect on cortical neuron migration. However, the authors note, that in such knockouts, there was no change of Wnt target gene expression, or in the phosphorylation state of some of the GSK-3 substrates. However, the authors do finally show that GSK-3 loss of function does lead to a consistent decrease of pDCX and pCRMP-2 levels."

Using a line allowing efficient deletion of GSK3 in newly-born excitatory neurons, the study documents migration failures both in the developing cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. These defects are not observed with medial eminence-derived interneurons. The conclusion that GSK play a critical role in the migration of cortical excitatory neurons is supported by data based on a GSK-overexpression approach causing enhanced migration. A thorough analysis of the canonical Wnt pathway suggests that it is not involved in the phenotype described here. By contrast, based on results illustrating a dramatic reduction of phosphorylated CRMP-2 it would appear that GSK may be critically involved in a semaphorin pathway. These results fit well with recent observations by Ip and colleagues as well as with a report by Chen and colleague on the role of Semaphorin 3A in the radial migration of cortical neurons. This is a very well executed, thorough and interesting study. In addition to the main results summarised in the above, another virtue of this study is that it reports on a range of negative, but surprising and useful results. Beyond the lack of involvement of the Wnt pathway, the lack of effects of the deletions of PTEN and especially of Cdc42 are quite surprising. Clearly then, this important study should be published in a scholarly, high profile journal as it is likely to be of high interest to developmental neurobiologists as well as to human neurogeneticists."
