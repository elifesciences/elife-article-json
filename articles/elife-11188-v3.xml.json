Recent studies in <i>Drosophila</i> have identified different classes of contact chemosensory neurons that detect female or male pheromones and influence courtship decisions. Here, we examine central neural pathways in the male brain that process female and male pheromones using anatomical, calcium imaging, optogenetic, and behavioral studies. We find that sensory neurons that detect female pheromones, but not male pheromones, activate a novel class of neurons in the ventral nerve cord to cause activation of P1 neurons, male-specific command neurons that trigger courtship. In addition, sensory neurons that detect male pheromones, as well as those that detect female pheromones, activate central mAL neurons to inhibit P1. These studies demonstrate that the balance of excitatory and inhibitory drives onto central courtship-promoting neurons controls mating decisions."

Male fruit flies, belonging to the species <i>Drosophila melanogaster,</i> also perform courtship toward female flies. However, male flies do not court other males. Previous studies have shown that sex-specific chemical signals (or pheromones) are important cues that males use to direct courtship towards females. Researchers have previously identified two sets of sensory neurons that detect pheromones: one set detects female pheromones and promotes courtship, while the other detects male pheromones and inhibits courtship. However it was unclear how these sensory neurons controlled courtship behavior."

These pathways send signals that either excite or inhibit a central target, called P1 neurons. Female pheromones activated a pathway that activates the P1 neurons, whereas male pheromones activate another pathway that inhibits the P1 neurons. Kallman et al. suggest that the balance of these excitatory and inhibitory signals controls a fly\u2019s decision to court."

Diverse sensory stimuli contribute to courtship decisions, including visual, auditory, and chemosensory cues. Important sensory cues detected primarily by contact chemosensory neurons are sex-specific cuticular hydrocarbons that act as pheromones. Multiple gustatory receptors and neurons have been implicated in pheromone detection (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bray and Amrein, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Koh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Miyamoto and Amrein, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Moon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Watanabe et al., 2011</a>). We and others recently showed that leg chemosensory neurons expressing the PPK23 pickpocket ion channel detect pheromones (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Toda et al., 2012</a>). PPK23 is expressed in sensory neurons of many leg chemosensory bristles, with generally two PPK23 cells per bristle. One cell responds selectively to male pheromones (M cells) and the other cell to female pheromones (F cells) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pikielny, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, the PPK25 channel is expressed in one of the two PPK23-positive cells per bristle, and PPK25 is required for cellular and behavioral responses to female pheromones, arguing that it selectively labels F cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Starostina et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Vijayan et al., 2014</a>). Unlike other classes of gustatory neurons implicated in pheromone detection, PPK23 cells are Fruitless-positive (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Toda et al., 2012</a>).

In addition, we found that F cells are the only leg neurons that express the <i>vesicular glutamate transporter-Gal4</i> driver (<i>vGlut-Gal4</i>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Daniels et al., 2008</a>), suggesting that the two classes differ in their neurotransmitter profiles and providing an additional marker that selectively labels F cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>).

A single male was placed in a chamber with a virgin female and number of single wing extensions by the male was monitored, as this motor subprogram occurs specifically during courtship song production. Males expressing dTRPA1 in F cells tested at 30\u00b0C (a temperature that activates dTRPA1) had a significantly higher wing extension rate than genetically identical flies tested at the non-activating temperature of 23\u00b0C or control flies at either temperature (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In contrast, males expressing dTRPA1 in M cells had a significantly lower wing extension rate at 30\u00b0C compared to genetic and temperature controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>).

As P1 neurons have been shown to respond to hydrocarbon extracts from female and male abdomens (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kohatsu et al., 2011</a>), we tested whether F and M cells provided specific sensory inputs onto P1 neurons. P1 activity was monitored by GCaMP6s calcium imaging in live flies expressing P2X2 in both F and M cells (F+M), F cells, or M cells while ATP was applied to the legs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Activation of F cells triggered calcium increases in P1, demonstrating that sensory neurons that detect female pheromones activate courtship-promoting P1 neurons. In contrast, we observed no significant calcium response in P1 neurons upon M cell activation. Activating F+M cells using the same <i>ppk23-LexA</i> driver (without expression of Gal80 in F cells) caused robust calcium responses in P1 neurons. These experiments argue that F cells, but not M cells, activate P1 neurons. This is in contrast to a previous study that observed calcium increases in P1 neurons in response to male abdomens (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kohatsu et al., 2011</a>); however, male abdomens may activate other sensory neurons in addition to M cells, such as Fru-negative pheromone-sensing neurons, gustatory neurons, or mechanosensory neurons. The selective activation of single classes of sensory cells allows us to disambiguate sensory cues and determine the contribution of specific sensory inputs."

We identified a pair of neurons with dendrites in the VNC and axons in the protocerebrum, marked specifically by <i>R56C09-Gal4</i>, which we name Pheromone Projection Neuron class 1 (PPN1) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). PPN1 neurons have cell bodies on the dorsal surface of the third leg neuromere, send projections to all leg and wing neuromeres in the VNC, and terminate in the ventrolateral protocerebrum. PPN1 dendrites are in close proximity to PPK25 axons and PPN1 axons overlap with P1 fibers, as shown by double labeling experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). To test whether PPN1 is involved in courtship behavior, we expressed dTRPA1 in PPN1 neurons and monitored male courtship towards females upon heat-induced neural activation. Consistent with a role in promoting courtship, activating PPN1 with dTRPA1 increased male courtship behavior toward females, as measured by unilateral wing extension rate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Unlike other neurons of the courtship circuit, PPN1 is not Fru-positive based on intersectional approaches with <i>Fru-Flp</i> and <i>Fru-LexA</i> and PPN1 projections are not sexually dimorphic (data not shown). Nonetheless, the anatomical and behavioral studies suggest that PPN1 might transmit F cell activation to P1 to promote courtship."

One set of neurons was prominently activated by F+M stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These were anatomically identifiable as mAL neurons (a.k.a. aDT2, aDTb) by their distinct arborization patterns (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cachero et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ito et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kimura et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Yu et al., 2010</a>). Based on their anatomy and neurotransmitter profile, mAL neurons have been proposed to be sexually dimorphic GABAergic interneurons that convey inhibitory courtship signals to the higher brain in males (<a href=\"#bib23\">Koganezawa et al., 2010</a>). However, the behavioral role of mAL neurons in courtship, the sensory stimuli that activate mAL, and the relationship between mAL and other components of the courtship circuit have not been determined. To examine these questions, we visually screened Gal4 lines (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jenett et al., 2012</a>) and identified <i>R43D01-Gal4</i>, which includes Fru-positive, GABAergic mAL neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Males expressing Rdl RNAi in P1 neurons displayed increased courtship toward other males, arguing that P1 neurons receive GABAergic inhibition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In addition, whereas Chrimson-mediated activation of P1 neurons induced courtship behavior in solitary males, co-activation of P1 and <i>R43D01-Gal4</i> neurons suppressed this behavior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), arguing that mAL suppresses P1-mediated courtship. To more directly test whether inhibitory signals from mAL impinge on P1, we simultaneously stimulated F and M cells and monitored activity in P1 before and after 2-photon guided lesioning of mAL axons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, simultaneous stimulation of F and M cells caused transient activation of P1 and lesioning mAL axons significantly increased P1 activation."

We used cell-specific activation to determine sensory pathways that impinge on courtship-promoting P1 neurons, providing insight into the functional connectivity of the courtship circuit. Female pheromones trigger neural pathways that excite and inhibit P1, with PPN1 providing an excitatory drive onto P1 and mAL providing an inhibitory drive. F cell activation leads to P1 activation and increased courtship behavior, arguing that the sum of inputs onto P1 produces excitation or that the sequence of inputs, i.e., fast excitation followed by inhibition, provides a temporal window for excitation. In contrast, M cells activate mAL neurons to inhibit P1 and inhibit courtship behavior. These studies argue that the balance of excitation and inhibition onto P1 neurons is different following F cell or M cell activation: F cell activation leads to overall P1 activation whereas M cell activation leads to overall P1 inhibition."

M cells on the leg activate GABAergic mAL neurons, which connect the SEZ and superior lateral protocerebrum. mAL axons interdigiate with P1 fibers, and mAL acitvation causes hyperpolarization of P1, likely through the GABA-A receptors containing the Rdl subunit.

However, we do not exclude the possibility that additional intermediary neurons may also be activated by F or M cells. Indeed, a recent study identified vAB3 neurons, with projections in the first leg neuromere in the VNC, the SEZ and protocerebrum, as activated by female but not male pheromones (<a href=\"#bib6\">Clowney et al., 2015</a>). This study also showed that mAL neurons are activated by male and female abdomens and provided evidence that mAL inhibits P1. Our independent observations are consistent with this work and extend the findings by providing behavioral evidence that each identified component of the circuit promotes or inhibits courtship as predicted by its response properties, by using cell-type specific activation strategies coupled with cell-type specific imaging studies to directly test potential connections, and by identifying PPN1 as a novel neural component of the courtship circuit. Together, the studies argue that pheromones activate multiple excitatory and inhibitory interneurons that impinge on P1."

Nevertheless, the same driver was used to express P2X2 in M cells in all calcium-imaging experiments, but application of ATP only elicited calcium responses in mAL neurons. Furthermore, the <i>ppk23-LexA</i> driver (in F+M cells) that we used for M cell activation was sufficient to produce ATP-mediated activation of P1 and PPN1, and these responses were abolished in the presence of Gal80 in F cells. Thus, the observation that M cells activate mAL but not P1 or PPN1 is unlikely due to technical limitations."

Pheromones provide excitatory or inhibitory drives onto P1, such that P1 activity reflects the integration of positive and negative sensory inputs, with female pheromones causing net excitation and male pheromones causing net inhibition. P1 also integrates inputs from other sensory systems, as P1 neurons respond to visual stimuli (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kohatsu and Yamamoto, 2015</a>) and olfactory pheromones (<a href=\"#bib6\">Clowney et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kohatsu et al., 2011</a>). Thus, diverse sensory stimuli may alter the weight of excitation versus inhibition onto P1 and bias the decision to court. Altering the weights of excitation or inhibition through experience or evolution is an appealing strategy to dynamically modulate the response to potential mates or to tune attraction to conspecifics. Taken together, these studies reveal an elegant strategy used by the nervous system in which excitatory and inhibitory inputs directly converge onto a common output to control a significant behavioral decision."

These flies, as well as control males fed normal food, were kept in constant darkness until the experiment. Imaging was performed similarly to above (\u201cGCaMP6s imaging\u201d) except that a 635 nm laser (Laserglow,\u00a0Canada) was directed at the thorax. The laser was turned to its highest power (~0.01 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) but was in standby mode until frame 6 of 20, at which time the key was turned to open the shutter. The laser was left on for 6 frames. During imaging, a 525/45 bandpass emission filter (Semrock,\u00a0Rochester,\u00a0\u00a0NY) was used to prevent the 635 nm laser light from interfering with the GCaMP signal. In some cases, we found that the 488 nm imaging laser was sufficient to activate Chrimson and trigger calcium responses in downstream neurons (i.e., ppk23&gt;Chrimson, P1&gt;GCaMP6s). In addition, we found that Chrimson was weakly activated in the absence of retinal (see ArcLight imaging below). However, these phenomena were not observed in PPN1&gt;Chrimson flies, likely due to weak PPN1 or Chrimson transgene expression."

For PPN1, a red anatomy scan (with 561nm laser) measuring CD8::tdTomato fluorescence was taken prior to GCaMP calcium imaging. A maximum intensity Z-projection for the anatomy scan and each GCaMP timepoint was used for analysis. The anatomy projection was used to draw an ROI covering the axonal region in the ventrolateral protocerebrum (\u201canatomical ROI\u201d). A second ROI was drawn in a region lacking both tdTomato and G-CaMP signal (\u201cbackground ROI\u201d). Mean fluorescence levels from the background ROI was subtracted from the anatomical ROI at each GCaMP timepoint resulting in the fluorescence trace over time: F<sub>t</sub>. \u25b3F/F(%) was calculated as follows: 100*((F<sub>t</sub>-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>), where F<sub>0</sub> is the mean fluorescence intensity during time points 2 to 5.

This study is a tour de force, supported by beautiful data. The authors use a wide range of advanced methods including functional imaging, optogenetics, anatomical methods as well as behavioral assays to dissect in detail the neural pathways involved in courtship behavior. The authors show that F cells (PPK25-positive/<i>vGlut</i>-positive), which are tuned to female pheromones, promote courtship behavior, while their anatomical counterpart, the so-called M cells (PPK25-negative/<i>vGlut</i>-negative), which are responsive to male pheromones, inhibit this behavior. Both cell populations represent genetically and anatomically distinct neuronal classes, which enables the authors to study and manipulate them separately from each other. By using highly sophisticated genetic tools, the authors dissect the neuronal pathway of female pheromone processing. They convincingly show that F cells excite P1 neurons in the protocerebrum via PPN1 neurons, which represent pheromone projection neurons that provide the link between F cells in the VNC and P1 neurons in the higher brain to trigger courtship in the end. In addition, the authors study the neuronal pathway underlying male pheromone processing and elucidate the circuitry up to the higher brain. They provide evidence that M cells inhibit P1 neurons via activation of GABAergic mAL neurons in the protocerebrum which results in courtship inhibition. The authors conclude that the balance of an excitatory and inhibitory input onto P1 neurons depends on the activation of F and M cells and therefore contributes to courtship decisions. To their credit, the authors offer rational interpretations that are nuanced with appropriate caveats about alternative explanations and scenarios. In conclusion, this is a very beautiful and impressive study which is comprehensive and convincing. It represents a lot of work and is a welcome addition to the literature."
