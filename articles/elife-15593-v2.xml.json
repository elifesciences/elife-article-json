We show that immobilization decreases NOTCH activity and mimics a NOTCH loss-of-function phenotype, a reduction in the number of muscle progenitors and increased differentiation. Ligand-induced NOTCH activation prevents the reduction of muscle progenitors and the increase of differentiation upon immobilization. Inhibition of NOTCH ligand activity in muscle fibers suffices to reduce the progenitor pool. Furthermore, immobilization reduces the activity of the transcriptional co-activator YAP and the expression of the NOTCH ligand <i>JAG2</i> in muscle fibers. YAP forced-activity in muscle fibers prevents the decrease of <i>JAG2</i> expression and the number of PAX7+ cells in immobilization conditions. Our results identify a novel mechanism acting downstream of muscle contraction, where YAP activates <i>JAG2</i> expression in muscle fibers, which in turn regulates the pool of fetal muscle progenitors via NOTCH in a non-cell-autonomous manner."

We show that immobilization decreases NOTCH activity and mimics a NOTCH loss-of-function phenotype, a reduction in the number of muscle progenitors and increased differentiation. Ligand-induced NOTCH activation prevents the reduction of muscle progenitors and the increase of differentiation upon immobilization. Inhibition of NOTCH ligand activity in muscle fibers suffices to reduce the progenitor pool. Furthermore, immobilization reduces the activity of the transcriptional co-activator YAP and the expression of the NOTCH ligand <i>JAG2</i> in muscle fibers. YAP forced-activity in muscle fibers prevents the decrease of <i>JAG2</i> expression and the number of PAX7+ cells in immobilization conditions. Our results identify a novel mechanism acting downstream of muscle contraction, where YAP activates <i>JAG2</i> expression in muscle fibers, which in turn regulates the pool of fetal muscle progenitors via NOTCH in a non-cell-autonomous manner."

By the end of fetal myogenesis, PAX7+ cells adopt a satellite cell position under the basal lamina of muscle fibers (<a href=\"#bib4\">Biressi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Br\u00f6hl et al., 2012</a>).

Activation of the NOTCH signaling pathway requires direct cell-cell contact between a signal-sending cell that expresses the NOTCH ligand and a signal-receiving cell that expresses the NOTCH receptor. Upon ligand activation, the intracellular domain of the NOTCH receptor is cleaved, translocates into the nucleus, associates with the transcription factor RBPJ and activates the transcription of the bHLH transcriptional repressor genes, <i>HES</i> and <i>HEY</i> [reviewed in <a href=\"#bib1\">Andersson et al. (2011)</a>]. In adult myogenesis, NOTCH is involved in satellite cell activation, proliferation and quiescence [reviewed in <a href=\"#bib45\">Mourikis and Tajbakhsh\u00a0(2014)</a>] and the absence of NOTCH signaling in muscle stem cells results in satellite cell depletion due to premature differentiation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bjornson et al., 2012</a>). In addition, during development, NOTCH has been described to activate embryonic myogenesis in somites (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rios et al., 2011</a>). During developmental myogenesis, active NOTCH signaling is associated with proliferating muscle progenitors, while NOTCH ligands are expressed in differentiated muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Delfini et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Vasyutina et al., 2007</a>).

In addition to being a nuclear effector of the Hippo pathway, YAP has been identified as a sensor of mechanical activity and mediates cellular and transcriptional responses downstream of mechanical forces (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aragona et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dupont et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Porazinski et al., 2015</a>).

We used decamethonium bromide (DMB), which blocks muscle contraction and induces rigid paralysis that leads to immobilization (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nowlan et al., 2010</a>). Two days after the inhibition of muscle contraction, we observed a reduction in the overall muscle size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,H</a>), which is consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib16\">Crow and Stockdale, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hall and Herring, 1990</a>). In addition, we observed a decrease of 58.07% (\u00b117.66) in the number of PAX7+ muscle progenitors in paralyzed compared to control muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D-F,H-J</a>). Consistently, the relative expression levels of <i>PAX7</i> and <i>MYF5</i> genes were significantly decreased in DMB-treated limbs compared to control limbs, as early as 12\u2009hr after DMB application and with a more prominent effect at 48\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In addition to the reduction of the muscle progenitor pool, we also observed an increase of myogenic differentiation assessed by an increase of <i>MYOD</i> and <i>MYOG</i> expression using RT-q-PCR or in situ hybridization in immobilized limbs compared to control limbs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,G,K</a>). The number of <i>MYOD</i>-expressing cells was also increased in paralyzed muscles compared to control muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1M</a>). In addition, muscle fibers were larger in limb muscles of DMB-treated fetuses compared to control muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,I</a>). The large muscle fibers were associated with several nuclei in paralyzed muscles, while control muscle fibers displayed only one nucleus on transverse sections (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>). Injection of pancuronium bromide (PB), a drug that exerts a flaccid skeletal muscle paralysis (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nowlan et al., 2010</a>) led to a similar but less pronounced effect, i.e. a 28.92% (\u00b17.27) reduction in the number of PAX7+ cells and a concomitant increase of muscle differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). DMB or PB treatments of chick fetal myoblast cultures did neither affect muscle progenitors nor their differentiation and did not change the expression levels of <i>PAX7, MYF5, MYOD</i> and <i>MYOG</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that DMB and PB did not have any off-target effect on myogenic cells. We conclude that the inhibition of muscle contraction leading to rigid or flaccid paralysis reduces the pool of fetal muscle progenitors and increases their propensity to differentiate."

                                "text": "The concomitant decrease of the muscle progenitor pool and increase of muscle differentiation following muscle paralysis was reminiscent of a NOTCH loss-of-function phenotype. In the murine system, loss of NOTCH signaling results in a reduction of the progenitor pool due to a precocious shift toward differentiation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Br\u00f6hl et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Vasyutina et al., 2007</a>). To determine whether NOTCH activity was modified upon immobilization, we examined the expression of components of the NOTCH signaling pathway in paralyzed muscles. During fetal myogenesis, the NOTCH ligand <i>JAG2</i> was expressed in MF20+ differentiated muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Delfini et al. 2000</a>), while <i>HES5</i> a recognized transcriptional readout of NOTCH activity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andersson et al., 2011</a>) was excluded from differentiated muscle fibers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,D</a>). The NOTCH ligand <i>DLL1</i> is expressed during chick and mouse embryonic myogenesis (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vasyutina et al. 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">Delfini et al., 2000</a>) but is not detected by in situ hybridization in chick limb fetal muscles (<a href=\"#bib19\">Delfini et al., 2000</a>). <i>JAG2</i> and <i>HES5</i> were also expressed in blood vessels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,E</a>, arrowheads). In immobilized fetuses, the expression of the <i>JAG2</i> and <i>HES5</i> was decreased in paralyzed muscles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,F,I</a>) compared to control muscles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,E,H</a>). We believe that the downregulation of <i>JAG2</i> and <i>HES5</i> expression in paralyzed muscles reflected a muscle-specific loss of gene expression, since <i>JAG2</i> and <i>HES5</i> expression was not affected in blood vessels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C,E,F,H,I</a>, arrowheads). Moreover, blood vessels are surrounding fetal muscles in normal conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J,K</a>), when muscle splitting is accomplished (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tozer et al., 2007</a>). Consistently, the <i>JAG2</i> and <i>HES5</i> mRNA levels were moderately but significantly downregulated in limbs of immobilized animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). We believe that the unchanged <i>JAG2</i> and <i>HES5</i> expression in blood vessels obscures the changes in <i>JAG2/HES5</i> expression levels in muscles. <i>HeyL</i> is another transcriptional readout of NOTCH that responds to NOTCH activation in limb fetal muscle cells in mice (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mourikis et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Br\u00f6hl et al., 2012</a>). The relative mRNA levels of <i>HEYL</i> gene were also significantly downregulated in limbs of immobilized animals compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). In summary, NOTCH activity was reduced in paralyzed muscles, as assessed by reduced expression of the NOTCH ligand <i>JAG2</i> in muscle fibers and of the transcriptional readout of NOTCH activity, <i>HES5,</i> in muscles. The downregulation of NOTCH signaling (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and the concomitant reduction of the muscle progenitor pool and increase of differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) observed in unloading conditions led us to conclude that immobilization mimics a NOTCH loss-of-function phenotype in muscles."

To determine whether NOTCH signaling acts downstream of mechanical signals to regulate the muscle progenitor pool, we performed NOTCH rescue experiments in immobilization conditions. DLL1-induced NOTCH activation in chick embryos inhibits muscle differentiation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Delfini et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hirsinger et al., 2001</a>). We first performed ligand-dependent NOTCH activation and analyzed the consequences for PAX7+ cells in normal conditions of muscle activity. In <i>DLL1</i>-activated NOTCH limbs, the pool of PAX7+ cells was maintained at E9.5, despite inhibition of muscle differentiation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which is consistent with the maintenance of PAX7+ progenitors in NICD-expressing cells in mouse fetuses (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mourikis et al., 2012</a>). Thus, ligand-activated NOTCH maintained the number of chick fetal muscle progenitors over time and impaired their differentiation. We then forced NOTCH activity in limbs of immobilized fetuses and analyzed the consequences for muscle using the contralateral non-grafted limbs as control (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Under immobilization conditions, the left limbs displayed a reduction in progenitor numbers and increased differentiation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C,E,G</a>). In contrast, in DLL1-expressing regions of (right) limbs, the number of PAX7+ cells was increased by 215.81% (\u00b1 29.36) and myosin expression was decreased compared to control (left) limbs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013I</a>). Since immobilization leads to a 2.3-fold (58.07%) reduction in the number of PAX7+ cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), we estimated that retroviral DELTA1-induced NOTCH rescued around 93% the number of PAX7+ cells in paralyzed muscles. We conclude that NOTCH activation prevents the decrease in the number of PAX7+ cells by preventing their inappropriate differentiation under immobilization conditions."

Since we observed a concomitant loss of the expression of the NOTCH ligand <i>JAG2</i> in muscle fibers and reduced expression of NOTCH target genes in paralyzed muscles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), it was unclear which cell type, between differentiated fibers and progenitors, first sensed muscle contraction. To test whether the loss of NOTCH ligand in muscle fibers would suffice to reduce the size of the muscle progenitor pool, we blocked NOTCH ligand function specifically in muscle fibers. For this, we overexpressed a dominant-negative form of DELTA1 (DELTA1/DN) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), which prevents NOTCH ligand processing in signal-sending cells and therefore blocked NOTCH activation in signal-receiving cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chitnis, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Henrique et al., 1997</a>). We performed chick somite-electroporation at the forelimb level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) using a stable vector that can be integrated into the genome in the presence of a transposase (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bourgeois et al., 2015</a>). This vector co-expresses the Tomato reporter gene and DELTA1/DN under the control of the mouse Myosin Light Chain (MLC) promoter that drives expression in chick-differentiated muscle cells and not in muscle progenitors (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). In electroporated Tomato-expressing muscles, 44.94% (\u00b112.88) of MF20+ cells displayed Tomato expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E</a>). We observed that the lack of ligand activity in around 45% of differentiated muscle cells significantly decreased the number of PAX7+ cells by 32.42% (\u00b17.23) compared to contralateral limbs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013K</a>). This shows that a diminution of NOTCH ligand activity in muscle fibers suffices to induce a decrease in the number of PAX7+ cells. We conclude that NOTCH ligand activity in muscle fibers is required to maintain the pool of fetal muscle progenitors."

                                "text": "We next aimed to identify the signal that could sense mechanical forces and regulate <i>JAG2</i> expression in muscle fibers. We focused on the transcriptional co-activator YAP that has been shown to sense mechanical signals independently of the Hippo pathway (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aragona et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dupont et al., 2011</a>). <i>YAP1</i> transcripts and YAP protein were expressed ubiquitously in chick limbs (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013E</a>). Since the subcellular localization of YAP protein reflects its transcriptional activity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dupont et al., 2011</a>), we examined nuclear YAP staining in MF20+ and PAX7+ cells. Unexpectedly, given the proliferative role of YAP in organ formation and tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zanconato et al. 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">Piccolo et al., 2014</a>), we found that 89.6% (\u00b13.65) of myonuclei of post-mitotic MF20+ cells displayed nuclear YAP protein (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A-C,G,H</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>). Moreover, YAP nuclear staining was stronger than YAP cytoplasmic staining in MF20+ cells; the cytoplasmic domains being delineated with MF20 staining (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). In contrast, only a subset of PAX7+ cells showed nuclear YAP staining (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). Myoblast proliferation has been shown to be associated with increased nuclear YAP in cell cultures (<a href=\"#bib31\">Judson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Watt et al., 2010</a>). However, we did not detect an obvious correlation between nuclear YAP protein and the proliferative state of PAX7+ cells in chick limb fetal muscles, in vivo (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>). <i>ANKRD1</i> and <i>CTGF</i> are two recognized direct target genes of YAP in many cell types (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>). ANKRD1 is a muscle ankyrin-repeat protein that binds sarcomeric proteins (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kojic et al., 2011</a>), and CTGF is a secreted matricellular protein involved in multiple cellular processes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Malik et al., 2015</a>). <i>ANKRD1</i> and <i>CTGF</i> expression was observed at the tips of MF20+ muscle fibers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I-M,Q</a>). In fetal limbs, <i>ANKRD1</i> was exclusively expressed in muscle fibers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I,K,L</a>), whereas <i>CTGF</i> transcripts were observed also in cartilage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6M,Q</a>). YAP staining in myonuclei and the expression of YAP target genes in muscle fibers show that YAP is active in differentiated muscle cells of chick fetal limbs. The regionalized location of the YAP target gene transcripts at muscle tips along fibers suggests that additional proteins are regionalized at muscle tips to regulate <i>ANKRD1</i> and <i>CTGF</i> transcription. In immobilized fetuses, <i>ANKRD1</i> and <i>CTGF</i> expression was lost in muscle fibers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I\u2013R</a>), but <i>CTGF</i> expression was maintained in cartilage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6M,P\u2013R</a>). Consistently, the mRNA levels of <i>ANKDR1</i> showed a drastic diminution, while those of <i>CTGF</i> displayed a significant but less strong reduction in immobilization conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6S</a>). <i>CYR61</i> is another matricellular protein of the same family as CTGF and is also a YAP target gene (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lai et al., 2011</a>). CYR61 mRNA levels were also decreased in limbs 48\u2009hr after DMB treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6S</a>). Moreover, the number of YAP+ myonuclei was significantly decreased in muscle fibers of paralyzed muscles compared to control muscles (dropping from 89.6% \u00b1 3.66 to 15.9% \u00b1 4.36) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). We did not observe any obvious modification of nuclear YAP staining in PAX7+ cells of DMB-treated versus control animals (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1J,K</a>), indicating that the nuclear YAP staining in the subpopulation of PAX7+ cells is unrelated to mechanical signals. We conclude that YAP activity is observed in muscle fibers of contracting muscles and that this activity is lost in paralyzed muscles."

We overexpressed chick fetal myoblasts in\u00a0a constitutively active form of mouse Yap that cannot be phosphorylated at Ser112 and is therefore preferentially translocated to the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib73\">Xin et al., 2013</a>). Transfection of YapS112A/RCAS into fetal myoblasts increased the expression levels of YAP target genes (<i>CTGF</i> and <i>CYR61</i>) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In addition, we also observed changes in muscle gene expression, previously described in C2C12 cells and satellite cell-derived myoblasts (<a href=\"#bib31\">Judson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Watt et al., 2010</a>), i.e. concomitant increase of <i>PAX7</i> and <i>MYF5</i> and reduction of <i>MYOD</i> and <i>MYOG</i> expression. YapS112A also activated <i>JAG2</i> expression and NOTCH target genes (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). <i>JAG2</i> expression was also upregulated in differentiated muscle cells after transfection with MLC-Tomato-YapS112A (Tomato+ FACS-sorted cells) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, YAP positively regulated <i>JAG2</i> expression in cultured fetal muscle cells. In order to assess whether YAP would rescue <i>JAG2</i> expression and the muscle phenotype observed in immobilization conditions, in vivo, we electroporated the MLC-Tomato-YapS112A construct in chick limb somites of embryos that were then treated with DMB. We observed that YAP forced-activity in differentiated muscle cells activated <i>ANKRD1</i> expression in paralyzed muscles compared to the loss of ANKRD1 in paralyzed muscles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B,D,E</a>). This shows that YapS112A activates YAP target gene expression in paralyzed muscles. YAP forced-activity also rescued <i>JAG2</i> expression in paralyzed muscles compared to the loss of <i>JAG2</i> in paralyzed muscles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C,D,F</a>). Moreover, the number of PAX7+ cells was increased of 55.19% (\u00b1 10.2) in muscles displaying YapS112A expression in differentiated muscle cells (visualized with Tomato expression) compared to muscles of contralateral limbs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G\u2013N</a>). We conclude that YAP forced-activity in muscle fibers prevents the loss of <i>JAG2</i> expression in muscle fibers and the decrease in the number of adjacent muscle progenitors in immobilization conditions."

ChIP sequencing data on chick limb cells analyzing promoter-associated histone marks allowed us to characterize the promoter of the chick <i>JAG2</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We identified a putative regulatory region (\u2212629 bp; \u22121023 bp) in the <i>JAG2</i> promoter, which contained a MCAT element (CATTCC), the known binding motif for TEAD complexes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Davidson et al., 1988</a>).

(2013)</a> and <a href=\"#bib55\">Shea et al. (2015)</a>) but not for skeletal muscle development. We show here that mechanical signals are required to maintain the PAX7+ muscle progenitor pool during fetal myogenesis. However, muscle contraction does not change cell proliferation but rather affects the maintenance of PAX7+ cells by preventing their differentiation. Although chondrocyte proliferation is reduced in growth plates of long bone in the absence of muscle contraction (<a href=\"#bib52\">Roddy et al., 2011</a>), skeletogenesis is also affected by proliferation-independent mechanisms after immobilization. Muscle contraction is necessary to maintain progenitors of the joint in an undifferentiated state and prevents their differentiation into chondrocytes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kahn et al., 2009</a>). Muscle contraction also controls chondrocyte convergence extension during cartilage development in zebrafish and mice (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shwartz et al., 2012</a>). This indicates that progenitor cells of the musculoskeletal system are sensitive to mechanical signals generated by muscle contraction during development and respond to mechanical activity by several mechanisms. Interestingly in plants, physical forces contribute to stem cell maintenance acting on a master regulator (STM homeobox) of Arabidopsis shoot meristems, and this is achieved by a mechanism that is independent of cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Landrein et al., 2015</a>)."

However, a reduction in the number of satellite cells has been described in adult muscle disuse/unloading animal models (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mitchell and Pavlath, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Verdijk et al., 2012</a>). Conversely, training exercises result in an increase of satellite cell number in humans (<a href=\"#bib14\">Crameri et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Suetta et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, physiological exercise has been shown to increases satellite cell numbers and to be beneficial for sarcopenic muscles [reviewed in <a href=\"#bib3\">Arthur and Cooley (2012)</a>]. Thus, our data and the available information in literature indicate that muscle stem cells are sensitive to mechanical forces during muscle development, homeostasis and ageing. It remains to be determined whether similar molecular or cellular mechanisms are active in these diverse settings."

                                "text": "Muscle paralysis causes a reduction of NOTCH activity and consequently muscle changes that are similar to those observed in NOTCH loss-of-function experiments. This shows that NOTCH activity is sensitive to mechanical signals during developmental myogenesis. Furthermore, ligand-induced NOTCH activation prevents the concomitant reduction of the fetal progenitor pool and increase muscle differentiation that is observed in the absence of muscle contraction. NOTCH components are also downregulated in bones of muscleless limbs of <i>Spd</i> mutant mice (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rolfe et al., 2014</a>), although there is no described NOTCH loss-of-function phenotype in bones of muscleless limbs or immobilized embryos. NOTCH signaling is known to control the development of the cardiovascular system, which experiences mechanical forces. The NOTCH pathway has been proposed as an intermediary between mechanical forces and heart development [reviewed in <a href=\"#bib24\">Granados-Riveron and Brook (2012)</a>], although the precise mechanotransduction pathway has not been identified. In adult muscle, NOTCH signaling has been extensively studied during muscle homeostasis, ageing and regeneration [reviewed in <a href=\"#bib45\">Mourikis and Tajbakhsh (2014)</a>], and correlations between mechanical forces and NOTCH have been established (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carlson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Conboy et al., 2003</a>). In summary, there is evidence for a change of NOTCH activity in different tissues during development and adult life upon muscle loading, but a functional link between mechanical signals and NOTCH has not been reported. We provide evidence that NOTCH signaling emerges as a molecular pathway that acts downstream of mechanical forces to regulate the pool of muscle progenitors during development. We believe that muscle activity acts on NOTCH ligand expression in fetal muscle fibers, since <i>JAG2</i> expression is lost in fibers upon unloading and the blockade of NOTCH ligand function in muscle fibers suffices to decrease the number of adjacent muscle progenitors. In zebrafish, swimming-induced exercises lead to extensive transcriptional changes in fast muscles, including modification of the expression of NOTCH ligands, <i>Dll1, Jag1</i> and <i>Jag2</i> in addition to other NOTCH components (<a href=\"#bib47\">Palstra et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, on a molecular level, mechanical forces exerted by the signal-sending cell are required for ligand-induced NOTCH activation in a receiving cell that does not appear to sense forces directly (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gordon et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wang and Ha, 2013</a>). Lastly, the NOTCH ligand Jagged1 rescues the Duchenne muscular dystrophy phenotype in zebrafish embryos and is upregulated in mildly affected dystrophin-deficient dogs (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vieira et al., 2015</a>). All these data converge to the idea that mechanical forces provided by muscle contraction are sensed by NOTCH ligands in muscle fibers."

                                "text": "We show here that YAP activity is sensitive to mechanical stimuli in fetal muscles in vivo. The preferential loss of YAP protein in myonuclei and YAP target gene expression in differentiated muscle cells in immobilized fetuses indicate that muscle fibers directly sense mechanical signals. Our results do not provide evidence that muscle progenitors directly sense mechanical signals, since nuclear YAP protein, proliferation rate and apoptosis were not modified in PAX7+ cells in immobilization conditions. Moreover, within fetal muscles, we did not detect any expression of the YAP target genes, <i>ANKRD1</i> and <i>CTGF</i> elsewhere than in MF20+ muscle fibers. YAP is, however, known to be expressed in activated satellite cells and has been shown to enhance satellite cell proliferation and to inhibit their differentiation in culture (<a href=\"#bib31\">Judson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Watt et al., 2010</a>). Consistently, YAP is upregulated in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and is a potent modulator of rhabdomyosarcoma formation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Crose et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tremblay et al., 2014</a>). However, in addition to YAP function in muscle cell proliferation, YAP was recently shown to be upregulated in muscle fibers by mechanical overload and to be critical for the size of skeletal muscle fibers in adult mice (<a href=\"#bib22\">Goodman et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Watt et al., 2015</a>), highlighting an additional YAP function in post-mitotic muscle fibers upon loading. YAP and NOTCH pathways have been shown to converge in many biological systems in mice (<a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">Yimlamai et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">Manderfield et al., 2015</a>). Oncogenic YAP variants activate the NOTCH ligand <i>JAG1</i> and consequently NOTCH signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tschaharganeh et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, TEAD binds to regulatory sequences of the <i>JAG1</i> gene in human breast cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib77\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>). The current view is that YAP and NOTCH pathways converge to promote proliferation, cell fate and differentiation in a cell-autonomous manner in vertebrates. Using muscle unloading during fetal myogenesis, we provide evidence that YAP acts on muscle progenitors in a NOTCH\u2013dependent and non-cell autonomous manner. This mechanism is reminiscent of that of the Drosophila YAP equivalent, Yorkie, during crystal cell differentiation in hematopoiesis, where Yorkie activates Serrate to induce responses in neighboring cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ferguson and Martinez-Agosto, 2014</a>). We demonstrate a mechanistic link between YAP activity in muscle fibers and the regulation of the muscle progenitor pool and show that this is mediated by a transcriptional regulation of the NOTCH ligand <i>JAG2</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). It remains to be determined if a similar link exists between YAP and NOTCH ligands in adult muscle fibers that could explain changes in satellite cell\u00a0number during unloading or uploading of muscles. We believe that the molecular mechanism that we identify during fetal development might be central to control muscle maintenance upon mechanical loading."

The monoclonal antibodies, MF20 that recognizes sarcomeric myosin heavy chains and PAX7 that recognizes muscle progenitors, developed by D.A. Fischman and A. Kawakami, respectively, were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biology Iowa City, IA 52242. The Desmin antibody was obtained from Sigma (dilution 1/100). The YAP mouse monoclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (dilution 1/50). The MEP21 antibody originates from (<a href=\"#bib42\">McNagny et al., 1997</a>). Proliferation analysis (EdU) was performed using the Click-iT kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,\u00a0France). Apoptosis was detected using the ApoTag kit (Millipore,\u00a0France). Secondary antibodies were conjugated with Alexa-488 or Alexa-555 (Invitrogen).

National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, <a href=\"http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/\">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</a>, 1997\u20132012). To quantify the number of PAX7+ cells in limb muscles of DMB- and PB-treated fetuses, the number of PAX7+ cells was counted per unit area in dorsal and ventral muscles on three sections of each three different limbs originating from either DMB-treated, PB- treated or control embryos. The quantification of PAX7+ cells and muscle area (delineated with PAX7 and MF20 expression domains) in DELTA1/RCAS-grafted embryos was performed in three sections of each grafted (right) and contralateral (left) limbs of three immobilized and three control embryos. Quantification was performed in ectopic DLL1-expressing muscles of grafted right limbs and compared with equivalent muscles of the contralateral left limbs originating from the same embryos. The quantification of the Tomato+/MF20+ cells, MF20+ cells, PAX7+ cells and muscle area in pT2AL-MLC-Tomato-DELTA1/DN electroporated embryos was performed in five sections of each electroporated (right) and contralateral (left) of four embryos. Quantification was performed in Tomato-expressing muscles of electroporated right limbs and compared with equivalent muscles of the contralateral left limbs originating from the same embryos. The quantification of PAX7+ cells in pT2AL-MLC-Tomato-YapS112A electroporated and immobilized fetuses was performed in four sections of each electroporated (right) and contralateral (left) of four immobilized fetuses. Quantification was performed in Tomato-expressing muscles of electroporated right limbs and compared with equivalent muscles of the contralateral left limbs originating from the same embryos.

In this paper, the authors test the novel hypothesis that muscle contraction is important for regulating the number of muscle progenitors during development. By using drugs that block the contraction of muscles in the chick embryo and by molecular manipulations, they describe the possible role that YAP and NOTCH signaling may play in this process. Altogether this is a nice study with interesting hypotheses put forward which have potentially important implications, however a number of important points need to be addressed before publication can be envisaged."

In order to estimate the number of MYOD-expressing cells, we therefore counted the number of Hoechst+ nuclei of MYOD-expressing cells (based on MYOD in situ hybridization) versus the total number of Hoechst+ nuclei in muscles. We observed an increase in the percentage of MYOD-expressing cells in paralyzed muscles compared to control muscles (New <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). Moreover, we observed larger Myosin+ fibres, with multiple grouped nuclei in paralyzed muscles compared to control muscles (New <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). The increase in the number of MYOD-expressing cells, of MYOD and MYOG expression (in situ hybridization and RT-q-PCR) combined with the larger muscle fibres with multiple nuclei in paralyzed muscles compared to control muscles leads us to conclude that the decrease in the number of PAX7+ cells is due to increased differentiation. Lastly, the reversion of the muscle phenotype i.e. diminution of differentiation (and increase in the number of PAX7+ cells) upon DLL1- activated NOTCH in immobilisation conditions, is also an indirect argument that there is an increase of differentiation (in addition to the decrease in the number of PAX7+ cells) in immobilisation conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

DLL1-activated NOTCH maintains the expression of muscle progenitor markers including PAX3, MYF5 and FGFR4, while inhibiting the expression of muscle differentiation genes, MYOD, MYOG, DES and MEF2C and Myosins (Bonnet et al., 2010, Havis et al., 2012). Based on the RCAS system, DLL1 will be overexpressed only in a subset of proliferating cells (any cell types). Consequently, DLL1 will act in trans to adjacent cells. Therefore, even if a subset of proliferating cells overexpressing DLL1 inhibited NOTCH in cis, the DLL1 signal is sufficient to activate"
