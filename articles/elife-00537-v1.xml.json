                    "text": "During inflammation and infection, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are stimulated to proliferate and differentiate into mature immune cells, especially of the myeloid lineage. MicroRNA-146a (miR-146a) is a critical negative regulator of inflammation. Deletion of miR-146a produces effects that appear as dysregulated inflammatory hematopoiesis, leading to a decline in the number and quality of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), excessive myeloproliferation, and, ultimately, to HSC exhaustion and hematopoietic neoplasms. At the cellular level, the defects are attributable to both an intrinsic problem in the miR-146a\u2013deficient HSCs and extrinsic effects of lymphocytes and nonhematopoietic cells. At the molecular level, this involves a molecular axis consisting of miR-146a, signaling protein TRAF6, transcriptional factor NF-\u03baB, and cytokine IL-6. This study has identified miR-146a to be a critical regulator of HSC homeostasis during chronic inflammation in mice and provided a molecular connection between chronic inflammation and the development of bone marrow failure and myeloproliferative neoplasms."

MicroRNA-146a (miR-146a) is a critical negative regulator of inflammation. Deletion of miR-146a produces effects that appear as dysregulated inflammatory hematopoiesis, leading to a decline in the number and quality of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), excessive myeloproliferation, and, ultimately, to HSC exhaustion and hematopoietic neoplasms. At the cellular level, the defects are attributable to both an intrinsic problem in the miR-146a\u2013deficient HSCs and extrinsic effects of lymphocytes and nonhematopoietic cells. At the molecular level, this involves a molecular axis consisting of miR-146a, signaling protein TRAF6, transcriptional factor NF-\u03baB, and cytokine IL-6. This study has identified miR-146a to be a critical regulator of HSC homeostasis during chronic inflammation in mice and provided a molecular connection between chronic inflammation and the development of bone marrow failure and myeloproliferative neoplasms."

When an injury or infection occurs, it is vital that hematopoietic stem cells replenish themselves in addition to developing into the new blood cells that are needed to help the body recover. Injury and infection also lead to the inflammatory response: tissue becomes inflamed as cytokines and other molecules are released at the site of the damage to help maintain the body\u2019s immunity. It is thought that inflammatory molecules directly affect the rate at which stem cells become immune cells, with the protein NF-\u03baB having an important role, but the details of this process are not fully understood."

Balanced self-renewal vs differentiation of HSCs is intricately regulated to ensure the long-term maintenance of HSCs and the hematopoietic system (<a href=\"#bib38\">Seita and Weissman, 2010</a>). Under stressed conditions, such as inflammation and infection, the balance is shifted in favor of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation and differentiation to produce more mature immune cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">King and Goodell, 2011</a>). Following the discovery that HSCs express TLRs and may sense and respond to infection and inflammatory signals directly (<a href=\"#bib26\">Nagai et al., 2006</a>), there has been an increasing appreciation of the role of proinflammatory cytokines and infection in the modulation of HSC activity. Numerous recent studies have shown that TLR activation or interferon stimulation leads to proliferation, skewed myeloid differentiation and impaired engraftment, and self-renewal of HSCs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Essers et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baldridge et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Esplin et al., 2011</a>)."

However, the function of NF-\u03baB in HSCs remains relatively unexplored. Under stress-free conditions, NF-\u03baB is not essential for HSC function, because mice genetically deleted for NF-\u03baB subunits, such as <i>Nfkb1</i> (also known as p50) and <i>Rel</i> (also known as c-Rel), have no apparent developmental abnormality in the hematopoietic system. Mice engrafted with p50 or c-Rel knockout HSCs or RelA knockout fetal HSCs also develop relatively normal immune system under stress-free conditions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gerondakis et al., 2012</a>). However, mice with activated NF-\u03baB signaling, as a consequence of deleting I\u03baB\u03b1, A20, or the inhibitory domain of p50 or p52 subunits of NF-\u03baB, display severe inflammation, early lethality, and complex phenotypes, making studies of HSCs difficult to perform and interpret (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lee et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gerondakis et al., 2006</a>)."

Here, we demonstrate that this single miRNA, miR-146a, functions as a critical guardian of HSC quality and longevity during chronic inflammatory stress in mice. In the absence of miR-146a, HSC homeostasis is disrupted under physiological stresses such as aging and periodic bacterial encounters, as indicated by declines of HSC number and quality and dysregulated HSPC proliferation and differentiation. Chronically, these nominal stressors can lead to severe pathologies, such as HSC exhaustion, bone marrow failure, and myeloproliferative disease, produced by chronic NF-\u03baB hyperactivation and IL-6 overproduction. This study speaks to a molecular pathway involving miR-146a/TRAF6/NF-\u03baB/IL-6 that links chronic inflammatory stresses to the functional decline and depletion of HSCs and the development of myeloproliferative diseases."

We purified by FACS various types of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) populations from young wild-type (WT) mice. We found that miR-146a and miR-146b were expressed at variable levels throughout hematopoietic development. The expression of miR-146a increased by twofold as long-term HSCs (defined as Lineage<sup>\u2212</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup> CD150<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>\u2212</sup>) differentiated into a mixed pool of short-term HSCs and multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs) (defined by Lineage<sup>\u2212</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup>, referred to as LSK cells).

To characterize the role of miR-146a in HSCs during low level of chronic inflammation, we allowed age- and sex-matched WT and miR-146a KO mice to age over a year. By 4 months, miR-146a KO mice developed a mildly hypercellular bone marrow indicated by an increase in total bone marrow CD45<sup>+</sup> cells, LSK cells, and long-term HSCs, with unaltered percentages of CD19<sup>+</sup>, CD11b<sup>+</sup> and CD3\u03b5<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). However, the increase in bone marrow HSPCs and mature cells was not sustained. By 8 months of age, miR-146a KO mice showed a significant decrease in the number of total bone marrow cells and phenotypically defined HSPCs, including LSK cells and CD150<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>\u2212</sup> or EPCR<sup>+</sup> long-term HSCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). The depletion became progressively more severe by 12 months of age when the majority of miR-146a KO mice showed only a residual number of CD45<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells and nearly complete exhaustion of HSCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). To understand the cellular process leading to a transient hypercellular marrow and eventual HSC exhaustion, we analyzed the bone marrow and spleen of aging miR-146a KO mice. Dysregulated hematopoiesis was observed in 8-month-old KO mice, as shown by an increased percent of LSK cells within the total bone marrow but a significantly decreased fraction of long-term HSCs among the LSK cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). By this age, miR-146a KO mice have already developed a prominent myeloproliferative phenotype (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>). In addition, miR-146a KO mice also showed a significant increase in the number of LSK cells and long-term HSCs in their spleens, which may be due to HSPC mobilization from bone marrow to spleen and/or de novo splenic HSPC proliferation in response to bone marrow failure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Furthermore, when total HSCs from the marrow and spleen of the same mice were summed, a reduction in HSC number was still apparent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Thus, although miR-146a KO mice contain normal levels of HSPCs when they are young, as they age, they go through a hypercellular stage and then eventually start to lose bone marrow HSCs and differentiated cells, leading to HSC exhaustion and bone marrow failure. This suggests to us that a dysregulated HSC differentiation toward the myeloid lineage is taking place in the marrow, accompanied by an increased appearance of HSCs in the spleen, probably as a form of homeostatic compensation."

We stimulated 8-week-old WT and miR-146a KO mice with LPS repeatedly for a month and observed a dysregulated HSC differentiation toward myeloid cells in miR-146a KO mice, compared to WT mice, a phenotype similar to the one that spontaneously occurs during aging of the KO mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H\u2013J</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Thus, miR-146a is needed to maintain HSC homeostasis in response to chronic inflammation. This suggests that the stress of chronic inflammation may be the physiologically relevant stimulator of HSC deficiency and myeloproliferative disease in the miR-146a KO mice. Perhaps, this becomes evident in aging miR-146a KO mice not subjected to experimental inflammatory stimulation because of a low-level continual exposure to bacterial materials even in our relatively clean conditions of animal husbandry. Whether true pathogens or commensals might be the inducing agents will require further investigation."

To assess HSC function, we compared WT and miR-146a KO bone marrow HSCs in their ability to generate the entire hematopoietic repertoire competitively in vivo. Total bone marrow cells from either 6-week-old WT or miR-146a KO mice, both which were CD45.2<sup>+</sup>, were transplanted along with an equal number of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> WT bone marrow cells, into lethally irradiated CD45.1<sup>+</sup> WT recipient mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). 6 months after transplant, CD45.2<sup>+</sup> and CD45.1<sup>+</sup> cells in both the CD45.2 WT/CD45.1 WT and CD45.2 KO/CD45.1 WT mice contributed identical proportions of cells in nearly all mature hematopoietic lineages and HSPCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Furthermore, when we purified long-term HSCs (defined by LSK CD150<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>\u2212</sup>) from WT or miR-146a KO bone marrow for competitive repopulation assay, we again observed a similar contribution of WT or miR-146a KO HSCs to total white blood cells and HSPCs 6 months after transplantation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, when we extended the experiment past 10 months, we began to observe a decreased contribution of miR-146a KO cells to long-term HSCs and LSK cells, but no reduction in CD45<sup>+</sup> cells, in the bone marrow of CD45.2 KO/CD45.1 WT mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Interestingly, while WT/WT chimera mice had similar numbers of CD45.2<sup>+</sup> and CD45.1<sup>+</sup> HSCs, KO/WT chimera mice showed a specific reduction in only the CD45.2<sup>+</sup> KO HSCs and a slight elevation of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> WT HSCs, possibly as a compensation for the loss of KO HSCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These data indicate that miR-146a-deficient long-term HSCs from young mice have an intrinsic defect and are more susceptible to depletion compared to WT HSCs in the same environment; however, the intrinsic defect of miR-146a KO HSCs from young mice is rather modest and takes 10 months to become apparent in this transplant setting."

At 4 months of age, miR-146a KO mice display a modestly hypercellular bone marrow and mildly increased phenotypically defined HSCs, but no disease phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Surprisingly, miR-146a KO cells were outcompeted by their WT counterparts as early as the first month after the transplant, and there was a steady decline in their percentage over a period of 6 months (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013H</a>). 6 months after transplant, neither group of mice showed signs of pathology, and they had identical levels of total mature hematopoietic cells and HSPCs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>). However, when comparing the contribution of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> cells vs CD45.2<sup>+</sup> cells to the total pool, we observed a significant disadvantage of miR-146a KO HSPCs and mature lineages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). This is consistent with the preferential loss of CD45.2<sup>+</sup> KO LSK cells and HSCs, but not the cotransplanted CD45.1<sup>+</sup> WT cells, in KO/WT chimera mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J,K</a>). Similar to the progressive decline of HSC number, the functional quality of HSCs became more and more compromised as miR-146a KO mice aged. When the competitive repopulation experiment was carried out with 6-month-old WT and miR-146a KO bone marrow cells, at which time increased myeloid and LSK cells and decreased long-term HSCs were already evident (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), we observed that miR-146a KO cells were completely overwhelmed by their WT counterparts in the recipient mice, with ratios of about 1 miR-146a KO cell to 10 WT cells for nearly all mature lineages and HSPCs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). The defective repopulating ability observed in all mature and HSPC lineages, including the long-term HSCs, in all three major hematopoietic compartments strongly suggests that the defect must originate in the most primitive HSCs. These data indicate that miR-146a-deficiency has a detrimental effect on the quality of HSCs under chronic inflammatory stress. The functional decline of HSCs in the competitive repopulation setting is evident in healthy 8-week-old miR-146a KO mice and becomes significant in 4-month-old mice in the absence of any observable pathology, indicating the physiological importance of miR-146a as a guardian of HSC quality and longevity."

WT to WT and KO to KO transplant mice were included as controls. After 5 months, we harvested all groups for analysis. Interestingly, mice of the WT to WT and WT to KO groups had identical levels of HSPCs in their bone marrows and spleens, suggesting that the miR-146a-deficient environment is not sufficient to induce significant HSC abnormalities in WT cells during this time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013G</a>). In comparison, mice in the KO to WT and KO to KO groups both showed twofold to threefold reductions in bone marrow HSCs and myeloid progenitor cells, but not in LSK cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>), and about a 10-fold increase in spleen HSPCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013G</a>).

However, the miR-146a-deficient environment has a contributory role to the overall enhanced myelopoiesis because WT bone marrow cells in the KO environment gave rise to a mild but statistically significant increase in the number of CD45<sup>+</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup> marrow cells and the percentage of CD11b<sup>+</sup> and Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells in their spleens, compared to the WT to WT mice (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1K,L,O,P</a>). More indicative is that when WT bone marrow cells that were transiently transplanted into miR-146a KO environment for 2 months were competed against WT control bone marrow cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>), they showed a modest advantage in generating myeloid and lymphoid lineages in their spleens, peripheral blood and to a lesser extent bone marrows, whereas bone marrow HSPCs remained unaffected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L\u2013O</a>). Overall, we have shown that hematopoietic-intrinsic deficiency of miR-146a plays the dominant role in driving the HSC defects and pathological myeloproliferation while the miR-146a deficient environment also contributes to the overall phenotype. In the absence of the driving force from the miR-146a deficient environment, lethal tumor pathology and HSC functional decline are attenuated or delayed."

But this does not tell us which cell type(s) in the hematopoietic compartment might influence aspects of hematopoiesis. Because miR-146a\u2013deficient lymphocytes display a hyperactivated phenotype with dysregulated cytokine production (<a href=\"#bib41\">Yang et al., 2012</a>), we first determined whether dysregulation of miR-146a-deficient lymphocytes might contribute to HSC depletion in miR-146a KO mice. To this end, we crossed mice with a targeted deletion of the <i>Rag1</i> gene, which is required for lymphocyte maturation, with miR-146a KO mice to generate <i>Mir146a</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> <i>Rag1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> double knockout mice (miR/Rag1 DKO). When WT, miR-146a KO (miR KO), Rag1 KO, and miR/Rag DKO mice were allowed to age for 10 months, the miR KO mice showed significant depletion of HSPCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>), a finding consistent with what we have observed previously in an independent examination of WT and miR-146a KO mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Specifically, long-term HSCs and LSK cells in the miR KO marrow were reduced to only 3% and 15% of the respective WT levels. In comparison, depletion of HSPCs in miR/Rag1 DKO bone marrow was partially rescued. Long-term HSCs and LSK cells in miR/Rag1 DKO bone marrow rose to 30% and 50% of the Rag1 KO levels, respectively, and the numbers of myeloid progenitor cells and total white blood cells were normal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013E</a>). These data indicate that miR-146a-deficient lymphocytes contribute substantially to the overall HSPC exhaustion. In addition, miR-146a-deficient lymphocytes were shown to be a major driver of the development of bone marrow failure and myeloproliferative disease, because miR/Rag1 DKO mice showed normal bone marrow cellularity and an attenuated splenomegaly and myeloproliferative phenotype (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013L</a>). This was also confirmed by histological analysis of femur bones of miR/Rag1 DKO mice, which showed absence of marrow fibrosis, a common and prominent feature of aged miR KO mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). However, the rescue was not complete because miR/Rag1 DKO mice still had mildly enlarged spleens and a twofold to threefold increase in the number of total white blood cells and myeloid cells compared to Rag1 KO mice, indicating that miR-146a deficiency in myeloid lineages has an intrinsic effect on the development of myeloproliferation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4M</a>). It is worth noting that the intrinsic effect of miR-146a deficiency in myeloid cells may either be in <i>cis</i> or <i>trans</i>: it could be the proliferating cells responding to a changed intracellular signaling or to factors secreted by myeloid cells acting in an autocrine or paracrine manner."

                                "text": "To understand the molecular mechanism responsible for the stress-induced hematopoietic dysregulation, we focused on the main pathway known to be regulated by miR-146a, the NF-\u03baB pathway. We have previously shown that aging miR-146a KO mice display hyperactivated NF-\u03baB activity that is responsible for the development of myeloid malignancy (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>). To study whether NF-\u03baB may also regulate HSC homeostasis under inflammatory stress, we used a transgenic NF-\u03baB\u2013GFP reporter mouse to monitor NF-\u03baB activity quantitatively and efficiently in various cell types by measuring GFP fluorescence (<a href=\"#bib24\">Magness et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lippert et al., 2009</a>). We first tested whether NF-\u03baB can be activated in LSK cells and HSCs in 2-month-old WT NF-\u03baB-GFP (WT-GFP) reporter mouse under steady state and after LPS stimulation. We found that about 6\u20137% of WT LSK cells and HSCs had basally activated NF-\u03baB activity, as measured by GFP expression. 6 hr after LPS challenge in vivo, the percentage of LSK cells and HSCs with activated NF-\u03baB increased to more than 25% (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Interestingly, 8-month-old WT-GFP mice also showed an increased percentage of LSK cells and HSCs with basal NF-\u03baB activation, compared to 2-month-old mice (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These data suggest that both LSK cells and HSCs have functional NF-\u03baB\u2013mediated transcription that can be augmented by LPS stimulation and aging. To analyze whether hyperactivated NF-\u03baB activity is a feature in miR-146a KO HSPCs, we bred NF-\u03baB-GFP reporter mice with miR-146a KO mice to generate <i>Mir146a</i><sup>+/+</sup> (WT-GFP), <i>Mir146a</i><sup>+/\u2212</sup> (miRHET-GFP), and <i>Mir146a</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> (miRKO-GFP) NF-\u03baB-GFP reporter mice. Unperturbed 8-week-old mice of WT-GFP, miRHET-GFP, and miRKO-GFP genotypes showed identical levels of basal NF-\u03baB activity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). After repeated LPS stimulation, miRKO-GFP mice, in comparison to WT-GFP and miRHET-GFP mice, showed increased percentages of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in various HSPCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>) and mature cells in their bone marrows, spleens and peripheral blood (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>), demonstrating that chronic inflammatory stimulation with bacterial components leads to hyperactivated NF-\u03baB activity in young miR-146a-deficient mice."

By 8\u20139 months of age, miR/p50 DKO mice still exhibited levels of white blood cells and long-term HSCs comparable to that of WT mice, indicating a rescue of the HSC defects (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). We have previously shown that p50 deletion rescues the myeloproliferative disease in 6-month-old miR-146a KO mice (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>). To determine whether myeloid cancer can also be reversed in miR/p50 DKO mice, we aged a cohort of WT, miR KO, p50 KO, and miR/p50 DKO mice to about 1\u00bd years, by which time about 50% of miR-146a KO mice will have developed myeloid cancer. Interestingly, miR/p50 DKO mice still showed reduced spleen weight and prolonged survival (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D,E</a>). The incidence of tumors was also significantly reduced in miR/p50 DKO mice, compared to miR KO mice (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>). However, there were still two cases of splenic myeloid tumors from a total of 46 miR/p50 DKO mice analyzed. Histological analysis of spleens revealed that the majority of miR/p50 DKO spleens, in contrast to the miR KO spleens with frequent myeloid sarcoma, showed preserved lymphoid follicular structures (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2G</a>). Furthermore, significant marrow fibrosis seen in aged miR KO mice was also reversed in miR/p50 DKO mice (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2H</a>). Transplantation of miR/p50 DKO spleen cells into <i>Rag2</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> <i>Il2rg</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice did not result in splenomegaly or myeloid pathology as transplanting miR KO splenic tumor cells did (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2I</a> and <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>). Together, these data show that p50-deficiency significantly ameliorates the myeloproliferative disease/myeloid cancer and marrow fibrosis in aging miR-146a KO mice. These findings highlight the importance of the NF-\u03baB pathway, particularly the p50 subunit, as the primary mediator of miR-146a deficiency driven myeloid oncogenesis and marrow failure. However, the modest but significant increase in spleen weight and the occasional occurrence of myeloid tumors and marrow fibrosis in aging miR/p50 DKO mice suggest that other NF-\u03baB subunits or other pathways regulated by miR-146a may also mediate the disease phenotype. Overall, we have shown that chronic inflammation-induced or aging-associated NF-\u03baB activation is responsible for driving HSC exhaustion, myeloproliferative disease, and myeloid cancer."

Surprisingly, when examining 2-month-old WT and miR-146a KO mice, we did not observe a significant difference in the percentage of BrdU<sup>+</sup> bone marrow LSK cells and HSCs whether the mice were unperturbed or stimulated with a single LPS injection for 12 hr (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2J</a>). However, after repeated LPS stimulation for 3 days, there were significantly higher percentages of BrdU<sup>+</sup> and Ki-67<sup>+</sup> miR-146a KO LSK cells and HSCs, compared to the WT cells, indicating an increased proliferation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013H</a>). Consistent with increased HSC cycling and myeloid differentiation, miR-146a KO mice started to show a small but statistically significant increase in CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells in their spleens and bone marrows after 3 days of LPS stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). It is also interesting to note that identically gated LSK cells and HSCs in spleen seemed to be less quiescent than their bone marrow counterparts, as indicated by a higher level of Ki-67 expression after LPS stimulation, suggesting that the bone marrow milieu may be a better environment for maintaining HSC quiescence during inflammation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). These data show that chronic inflammation induces increased HSC proliferation and cycling in miR-146a KO mice and underscores the particular importance of miR-146a in modulating HSC activity during chronic inflammation, as opposed to in an acute setting."

To this end, we injected WT-GFP mice with LPS and BrdU for 4 hr and measured both NF-\u03baB activation and proliferation simultaneously. Interestingly, we only found a small fraction of cells that were doubly positive for GFP and BrdU or Ki67, indicating that cells with NF-\u03baB activation and cells that were proliferating represented two largely independent populations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>). Within the HSPC subsets, myeloid progenitor cells (L<sup>\u2212</sup>S<sup>\u2212</sup>K<sup>+</sup>) contained the largest fraction of rapidly proliferating cells, whereas HSCs and LSK cells contained the highest percentage of cells with NF-\u03baB activation. This suggests that NF-\u03baB does not appear to directly stimulate HSPC proliferation in a cell-autonomous manner. However, it remains to be seen whether NF-\u03baB regulates other aspects of HSC biology, including cell death, differentiation, and trafficking. Cell intrinsic function of NF-\u03baB in HSCs requires further study."

More importantly, overexpression of IL-6 in bone marrow cells in mice results in myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative disease (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brandt et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hawley et al., 1992</a>). Furthermore, we have shown that NF-\u03baB appears to regulate HSC proliferation in miR-146a-deficient mice in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Therefore, we focused on the proinflammatory cytokines that were overproduced in miR-146a KO mice, believing that miR-146a-deficient mice likely suffer from a chronic inflammation-driven process, and these proinflammatory cytokines produced by other immune cells upon NF-\u03baB activation may be the direct activators of HSCs."

However, upregulation of TNF\u03b1 was only prominent in miR-146a KO spleens that have developed myeloid sarcomas, but not in ones without overt tumors, suggesting that TNF\u03b1 upregulation may be a quite late event in oncogenesis. To evaluate the temporal relationship between the increase in inflammatory cytokines and the onset of HSC exhaustion and myeloproliferation, we examined younger, 6- to 10-month-old, mice. At this time, the HSC depletion and myeloproliferative phenotype start to become prominent, but no overt splenic tumors have developed. Similar to what was observed in 18-month-old mice, IL-6 expression was upregulated in both spleen and bone marrow cells of miR-146a KO mice, compared to WT mice. More importantly, miR/p50 DKO mice showed a level of IL-6 comparable to that of WT mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). However, the same trend was not observed for TNF\u03b1 expression at this age (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, when bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from 8-week-old mice were stimulated with LPS in vitro, IL-6, but not TNF\u03b1, showed consistently increased induction in miR-146a KO BMMs compared to WT BMMs. Interestingly, the exaggerated IL-6 induction in miR-146a KO BMMs was significantly more prominent with restimulation at a time when WT BMMs showed resistance to endotoxin restimulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Nahid et al., 2011</a>). This again suggests that miR-146a may be particularly important during chronic and repeated inflammatory challenge. In addition, induction of IL-6, but not TNF\u03b1, in BMMs was highly dependent on p50. In p50 KO BMMs, IL-6 induction was almost completely abolished (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These data suggest that IL-6 upregulation is an early feature in miR-146a deficiency driven HSC depletion and myeloproliferation and reduction in the IL-6 level may be an important factor underlying the reduced pathology when p50 is deleted."

Unperturbed young WT, miR-146a KO, IL6 KO, and miR/IL6 DKO mice showed similar levels of CD11b<sup>+</sup> and Gr1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells in peripheral blood, while B cells were slightly reduced in miR/IL6 DKO mice (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). When LPS was repeatedly administered in young WT, miR-146a KO, and miR/IL6 DKO mice, an accelerated myeloproliferative phenotype was observed in miR-146a KO mice that was largely absent in miR/IL6 DKO mice. Specifically, the significantly increased spleen weight, total white blood cells, myeloid cells, and erythroid precursor cells present in miR-146a KO were all reduced in miR/IL6 DKO mice to levels comparable to those of WT mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The same trend was also observed in the peripheral blood (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). In the bone marrow, repeated LPS stimulation of WT and miR/IL6 DKO mice induced variable hypocellularity. However, the depletion was more severe and consistent in miR KO bone marrow (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Furthermore, when WT, miR-146a KO, IL6 KO, and miR/IL6 DKO mice were allowed to age to 6\u20137 months, myeloproliferation and marrow fibrosis observed in miR-146a KO mice were also significantly reduced in miR/IL6 DKO mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>). More interestingly, the disrupted bone marrow HSPC homeostasis and expansion of splenic HSPCs seen in miR-146a KO mice were also partially normalized in miR/IL-6 DKO mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,G</a>). These data show that in the absence of IL-6, miR-146a KO mice display a partially reduced HSC defect and less myeloproliferative disease, indicating that upregulation of the NF-\u03baB-responsive proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 is an important driver of the HSC defect and myeloproliferative disease in miR-146a KO mice under chronic inflammatory stress induced by aging or repeated bacterial stimulation."

                                "text": "Because a variety of cells have the ability to produce IL-6 and IL-6 in turn has a pleiotropic effect on multiple cell types of the hematopoietic lineage, we wanted to identify the important cellular source and cellular target of IL-6 in mediating HSC defect and myeloproliferative disease in miR-146a KO mice. We have previously shown that miR-146a-deficient lymphocytes are involved in the development of the HSC defect and myeloproliferation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), we asked whether overproduction of IL-6 by miR-146a-deficient lymphocytes represents one potential contributing mechanism. To test this, we first stimulated WT, miR-146a KO, Rag1 KO, and miR/Rag1 DKO mice with LPS and measured IL-6 production in vivo. We found increased IL-6 production in the serum of miR-146a KO mice, compared to that of WT mice. In comparison, the serum IL-6 level in miR/Rag1 DKO mice was only modestly increased in a nonstatistically significant manner, compared to that of Rag1 KO mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). This indicates that in the absence of lymphocytes, exaggerated IL-6 production is attenuated. However, the modest increase in IL-6 production in miR/Rag1 DKO mice suggests that cells other than lymphocytes, such as myeloid cells shown earlier (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), also exhibit enhanced IL-6 production in response to stimulation. To further study the contribution of lymphocytes, we stimulated splenocytes from WT or miR-146a KO mice in vitro with either LPS to activate both T and B cells or a combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 to activate T cells specifically. In both conditions, we observed significantly increased production of IL-6 by miR-146a KO lymphocytes, compared to WT lymphocytes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Lastly, to determine whether IL-6 overproduced by miR-146a KO T cells represents an important contributor to the HSC phenotype, we transplanted total T cells from spleens of WT, miR-146a KO, or miR/IL-6 DKO mice into 10-month-old miR/Rag1 DKO mice to see whether reintroducing miR-146a-deficient T cells will promote bone marrow depletion. Interestingly, compared to miR/Rag1 DKO mice that received WT T cells, mice that received miR-146a KO T cells, but not miR/IL-6 DKO T cells, displayed bone marrow depletion of total white blood cells, myeloid progenitor cells, LSK cells, and long-term HSCs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). In addition, mild leukopenia was also observed only in the mice that received miR-146a KO T cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). These data have demonstrated the particular importance of miR-146a-deficient T cells, specifically their dysregulated IL-6 production, in driving HSC and bone marrow depletion. However, because miR/Rag1 DKO mice do exhibit depleted HSCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), other intrinsic and extrinsic contributors of HSC defect besides T cells require further examination. In addition, it remains to be tested whether the compositions and inflammatory properties of T cells, such as percentages of regulatory T cells, T<sub>h</sub>1, T<sub>h</sub>2, and T<sub>h</sub>17 cells, from WT, miR-146a KO, and miR/IL-6 DKO mice are different, which may explain their different effects on promoting inflammation and bone marrow depletion."

To further determine the direct effect of IL-6 and LPS on more refined HSPC subsets, we sorted LSK cells and long-term HSCs from bone marrow of young WT and miR-146a KO mice and stimulated them with IL-6 or LPS in the presence of BrdU for 18 hr. While HSCs did not have statistically significant difference in BrdU incorporation, KO LSK cells showed higher percentage of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells than WT LSK cells under IL-6 stimulation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>). Interestingly, no proliferative differences between WT and KO LKS cells or HSCs were detected in response to a single dose of LPS stimulation at 1 \u03bcg/ml concentration (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,I</a>). These data suggest that the hematopoietic phenotypes seen in miR-146a KO mice may be mediated by IL-6 acting directly on LSK cells, but not long-term HSCs.

The vectors can consistently overexpress TRAF6 and IRAK1 by 10-fold and 100-fold, respectively, in bone marrow HSPCs (with about 50% transduction efficiency) (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). After transplantation, we followed the mice for 9 months. Interestingly, the percent of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in nucleated peripheral blood cells transduced with either pMIG-Luc or pMIG-IRAK1 remained stable or increased slightly, whereas the GFP percentage in the pMIG-TRAF6 group declined from over 40% initially to less than 10% by the end of 9 months (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Histological analysis of harvested femur bones revealed that TRAF6-expressing mice had reduced bone marrow cellularity, compared to the control mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Given the lack of apparent phenotype in IRAK1-overexpressing mice, we further pursued TRAF6 as the more relevant target of miR-146a in the context of HSC biology. When we repeated the bone marrow transplant with 100% transduced bone marrow cells by sorting the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, mice receiving TRAF6-overexpressing bone marrow cells rapidly succumbed to bone marrow failure (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). These mice showed severe anemia and reduced numbers of GFP<sup>+</sup> white blood cells in their peripheral blood, compared to the pMIG-Luc control group (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G\u2013I</a>). These data indicate that upregulation of TRAF6 in HSPCs results in bone marrow failure in mice, thus emphasizing the importance of tightly regulating TRAF6 level in HSPCs. This result suggests that derepression of TRAF6 in miR-146a-deficient HSPCs could be primarily responsible for driving HSC depletion and bone marrow failure."

HSCs in MDS patients have a defect in the ability to differentiate into mature cells, leading to peripheral cytopenia. MDS also have a predilection to progress to bone marrow failure or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). MiR-146a KO mice recapitulate several key characteristics of MDS, including the decline in function of HSCs, peripheral cytopenia, and the propensity to progress to bone marrow failure and myeloid malignancy. To assess whether miR-146a deficiency might represent a pathogenic feature of MDS, we analyzed the expression of miR-146a in bone marrow samples from healthy donors, MDS, and AML patients. The cohort of unselected MDS, but not AML, samples showed a fourfold reduction in the level of miR-146a (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8J</a>), suggesting that miR-146a deficiency may be involved in MDS pathogenesis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Starczynowski et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Rhyasen and Starczynowski, 2012</a>)."

Mice lacking miR-146a develop a series of defects that can be accelerated by multiple LPS treatments. Extrapolating from this observation, we suggest that the natural exposure of miR-146a KO mice to bacteria and other infectious agents may be the cause of the \u2018spontaneous\u2019 deterioration of HSC function (bone marrow failure), excessive myelopoiesis, and tumor formation that are observed in these animals. It could well be that the excess myelopoiesis seen in normal mice as they age is a consequence of the same process (<a href=\"#bib37\">Salminen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beerman et al., 2010</a>). One obvious test of these notions, to examine HSC function in germ-free mice, is not ideal because of the many secondary consequences of completely ablating the normal microbiota and will require more subtle approaches. The remarkable circumstance that a single microRNA plays such a crucial role in this process has allowed us to uncover it."

We propose the following pathway of action of miR-146a: infections or other perturbations activate NF-\u03baB through TRAF6 and other signal transducers; the basal and NF-\u03baB-enhanced levels of miR-146a then limit the amount of TRAF6, allowing the system to quickly return to basal NF-\u03baB activity when the danger has passed; the transient NF-\u03baB activation causes a transient increase in IL-6 and the IL-6 acts on the stem and progenitor cells to transiently promote proliferation and myeloid differentiation. Lacking miR-146a, the action of NF-\u03baB is extended, the production of IL-6 is exaggerated, the myelopoietic stress on the HSPCs is extended, and the over time the pathological symptoms of continual myelopoiesis, bone marrow failure, and cancer emerge. This may be a pathway in humans that leads to myelodysplastic syndrome."

In addition, we have to be cautious of claims about HSC-intrinsic function due to the fact that HSCs are continuously producing more differentiated cells, which harbor the same genetic alterations and are also subject to the same external stimuli."

We have shown that miR-146a has an intrinsic function within HSCs because miR-146a-deficient HSCs have an intrinsic defect and are preferentially depleted compared to WT HSCs in the same environment. However, this intrinsic defect is modest. Other miR-146a-deficient hematopoietic cells, especially T cells, have a strong effect on HSCs. In addition, miR-146a-deficient nonhematopoietic cells also contribute to the overall HSC abnormality. TRAF6 is derepressed in miR-146a-deficient HSPCs and overexpression of TRAF6 in enriched HSPCs recapitulates the bone marrow failure phenotype. However, whether TRAF6 is functioning in HSCs or more differentiated cells require further examination. Furthermore, TRAF6 is known to regulate the MAPK and PI3K pathways in addition to NF-\u03baB. Further work will be required to clarify their respective contributions in mediating bone marrow failure. We have also demonstrated the functional activity of NF-\u03baB in HSCs and other hematopoietic cells. However, NF-\u03baB does not appear to regulate HSC proliferation cell autonomously. In fact, in WT mice, NF-\u03baB activation does not correlate with proliferative activity in any stem and progenitor cells. The functional consequence of NF-\u03baB activation within HSPCs remains an interesting unanswered question. What is clear is that NF-\u03baB does a significant amount of its \u2018damage\u2019 to HSCs through the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, produced by T cells and myeloid cells, among others. IL-6 acts directly on LSK cells to stimulate proliferation and miR-146a\u2013deficient LSK cells are more proliferative than WT LSK cells under IL-6 stimulation. In summary, miR-146a is functional in HSCs, LSK cells, T cells, myeloid cells, as well as nonhematopoietic cells, and deficiency of miR-146a in all these cells leads to the full-blown myeloproliferative disease and HSC exhaustion during chronic inflammatory stress. Based on this study and our previous work (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boldin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yang et al., 2012</a>), we have shown that a circuitry involving miR-146a/TRAF6/NF-\u03baB is operational in miR-146a-deficient T cells and myeloid cells, leading to IL-6 overproduction. IL-6 in turn directly stimulates LSK cells to proliferate and differentiate. We have also demonstrated derepression of TRAF6 and enhanced activation of NF-\u03baB in miR-146a-deficient HSCs and LSK cells. However, it is not yet clear that the cell-autonomous function of miR-146a in HSCs is through the regulation of TRAF6 and NF-\u03baB and the functional importance of TRAF6 and NF-\u03baB in HSCs requires further clarification."

In this study, we added miR-146a to the list of genes that regulate HSC homeostasis during chronic inflammation and aging. Overexpression of miR-155 also causes pathological myelopoiesis similarly to that caused by deletion of miR-146a. MiR-155 appears to act by inhibiting the negative-acting phosphatase SHIP1 (<a href=\"#bib31\">O\u2019Connell et al., 2009</a>). Enforced expression of TRAF6 in HSPCs results in cell death and/or engraftment failure and rapid bone marrow failure, a finding consistent with a previous study (<a href=\"#bib40\">Starczynowski et al., 2010</a>). The same study also shows that some key features of 5q-syndrome, a subtype of MDS, seen in TRAF6-overexpressing mice are mediated by IL-6. It is worth noting that the level of TRAF6 expression in transduced HSPCs is about 10-fold higher than that observed in miR-146a-deficient HSCs, and thus the phenotype of enforced TRAF6 overexpression in HSPCs is more rapid and dramatic, precluding a careful analysis of HSC function and activity. It will be interesting to develop a system to modulate the level of TRAF6 overexpression in a more controlled manner for HSC analysis and to characterize the effects of downregulating TRAF6 genetically or by RNA interference in miR-146a-deficient HSCs. In addition to TRAF6 and IRAK1, STAT1 and RelB have been identified as direct targets of miR-146a in regulatory T cells and Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, respectively (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Etzrodt et al., 2012</a>).

As a downstream transcription factor of both types of interferons, one might speculate that derepression of STAT1 in miR-146a-deficient HSCs may have a cell-intrinsic role in promoting HSC proliferation and exhaustion. Our preliminary analysis has shown upregulation of STAT1 mRNA in miR-146a-deficient HSPCs (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). A recent study has also suggested a role of noncanonical NF-\u03baB subunits RelB and NF-\u03baB2 in regulating HSC self-renewal (<a href=\"#bib44\">Zhao et al., 2012</a>). It remains to be determined whether other putative targets of miR-146a, such as STAT1 and RelB, also contributes to the HSC defect in the context of miR-146a deficiency."

In addition, IL-6 can also activate NF-\u03baB in certain contexts (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</a>). So, IL-6 can exert its effect either directly on HSPCs and myeloid cancer cells or indirectly by contributing to the general proinflammatory and proproliferative environment through both STAT3 and NF-\u03baB. This signaling pathway involving NF-\u03baB/IL-6/STAT3 has been demonstrated to be important in the pathogenesis of various epithelial cancers associated with inflammation, especially gastrointestinal cancer and breast cancer (<a href=\"#bib28\">Naugler and Karin, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Grivennikov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Iliopoulos et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Rakoff-Nahoum and Medzhitov, 2009</a>).

Given the multitude of mechanisms involved in downregulating NF-\u03baB activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Liew et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ruland, 2011</a>), these results highlight the critical, nonredundant role of miR-146a in the negative regulation of NF-\u03baB activity during chronic inflammation. In this way, miR-146a acts as a guardian of the functional capabilities and longevity of murine hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, this study also has several other important implications. First, it provides direct evidence that prolonged and uncontrolled inflammation-driven hematopoiesis can ultimately exhaust the HSC pool and lead to myeloid malignancies in genetically susceptible hosts, according nicely with some recent large scale epidemiological studies showing that chronic immune stimulation from past infection or autoimmunity increases the risk of developing myeloid malignancies, including AML, MDS, and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kristinsson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hasselbalch, 2012</a>). This study provides a possible molecular basis for these intriguing epidemiological observations and offers a unique experimental system to further explore the cellular and molecular pathways by which infection and autoimmunity can trigger myeloid malignancies; it also provides a system to test potential therapeutic interventions and chemoprevention. Second, miR-146a-deficient mice represent an excellent model to understand the pathogenesis of MDS, a hematopoietic malignancy of older adults (median age of 70 years) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sekeres et al., 2008</a>) that has consistently shown reduced expression of miR-146a. Lastly, it suggests that chronic inflammation may be a potential cause of the age-related decline in HSC function. Therapeutically, given that many of the cellular and molecular components are important in driving the overall pathology, inhibition of p50 subunit of NF-\u03baB, hyperactivated lymphocytes, IL-6 overproduction, and TRAF6 represent multiple opportunities for therapeutic intervention to disrupt the pathogenic process leading to myeloid malignancies, and combinatorial inhibition may have even greater therapeutic impact."

Previous papers from this lab have shown that mir-146a deletion results in T-cell mediated chronic inflammation and a myeloproliferative disorder. In this work, the authors show that HSCs become depleted by 8 months after birth. HSCs have reduced function in transplantation assays, and they cycle more than wild-type HSCs. These defects are to a large extent mediated by lymphocytes and by activated NF-kB signaling. They also suggest a role for IL-6 in mediating HSC depletion downstream of NF-kB and that mir-146a regulates NF-kB activity through TRAF6. Their data are consistent with, but more mechanistic than, several other papers in the literature suggesting that inflammation drives HSCs into cycle and impairs HSC function. The miR-146a HSC phenotype is very interesting, supported by considerable high quality data, and arguably different from anything seen previously."

This leads to IL-6 expression, which then promotes HSC depletion through increased myeloid differentiation. This is highly speculative and blurs the distinction between what Zhao et al. have tested and what they have not. Is the modest increase in TRAF6 really mediating the effects of miR-146a on HSCs? Does TRAF6 act autonomously in HSCs? What cells secrete IL-6? Does IL-6 really act on HSCs, or on other cells? Can IL-6 really promote myeloid differentiation by HSCs, or does it just promote the proliferation of myeloid progenitors that arise from HSCs? The authors have provided a lot of interesting and compelling data and should not be expected to answer all of these questions in this study; however, they should be careful to distinguish between what they have shown and what is speculation in the Discussion."

When small numbers of HSCs were transplanted with wild-type marrow, they did not observe HSC depletion in the recipient mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and in competitive whole bone marrow transplants HSC depletion was not observed until 10 months after the transplant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Furthermore, they show that Rag deficiency partially rescues HSC depletion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), raising the possibility that engrafted inflammatory T-cells or neoplastic myeloid cells indirectly cause HSC depletion. If only the mir-146a deficient HSCs are depleted in the competitive reconstitution experiments (not the competing wild-type HSCs) then this possibility would seem far-fetched. However, the data are usually presented in unconventional ways for the reconstitution experiments, making it hard to assess whether the competing wild-type HSCs consistently fail to be depleted. It would be very helpful to know absolute numbers of mir-146a deficient versus wild-type HSCs in the same mice."

If the donor HSCs become depleted, the effects are likely non-cell autonomous to HSCs and they are an indirect consequence of other mir-146a deficient hematopoietic cells. If p50-deficient HSCs are not depleted even as the mir-146a competitor marrow causes inflammation and MPD, then NF-kb likely causes depletion cell-autonomously as the authors have concluded."

For example, LSK cells might proliferate at a higher rate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I, J</a>) or the differentiation or phenotype of cells other than HSCs may be altered.

In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013I</a> the authors show that miR-146a ko cells proliferate more strongly.

Does TRAF6 act autonomously in HSCs? What cells secrete IL-6? Does IL-6 really act on HSCs, or on other cells? Can IL-6 really promote myeloid differentiation by HSCs, or does it just promote the proliferation of myeloid progenitors that arise from HSCs?

Crossing miR-146a KO with TRAF6 KO will take 6 months to generate double KO. If using siRNA to knockdown TRAF6 in miR-146a KO HSCs, this experiment will require at least 6-month follow-up in order to sufficiently assess the status of HSCs.

This means in the same environment, KO HSCs and LSK cells are out-numbered by WT HSCs and LSK cells. Because in WT:KO chimera mice, WT and KO HSCs are experiencing the same insult from WT or KO mature cells or environmental stimuli, if KO HSCs don\u2019t have an intrinsic defect, the ratios between KO and WT HSCs should be 1. The ratios should change only when KO and WT HSCs have intrinsic difference in response to identical external factors. As suggested by the reviewers, we have also included three new figures (new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E, J, K</a>) showing the absolute numbers of total, CD45.2<sup>+</sup> and CD45.1<sup>+</sup> LSK cells and HSCs in WT:WT and KO:WT chimera mice to make this point more clearly.
