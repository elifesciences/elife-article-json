We now show, using \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 constructs containing artificial cleavage sites, that this processing is an essential step permitting voltage-dependent activation of plasma membrane N-type (Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2) calcium channels. Indeed, uncleaved \u03b12\u03b4 inhibits native calcium currents in mammalian neurons. By inducing acute cell-surface proteolytic cleavage of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4, voltage-dependent activation of channels is promoted, independent from the trafficking role of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4. Uncleaved \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 does not support trafficking of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 channel complexes into neuronal processes, and inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into synaptic boutons, and we can reverse this by controlled intracellular proteolytic cleavage. We propose a model whereby uncleaved \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 subunits maintain immature calcium channels in an inhibited state. Proteolytic processing of \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b4 then permits voltage-dependent activation of the channels, acting as a checkpoint allowing trafficking only of mature calcium channel complexes into neuronal processes."
