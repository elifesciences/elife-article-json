Using both in vivo and in vitro approaches, we show that cavin-3 dictates the balance between ERK and Akt signaling. Loss of cavin-3 increases Akt signaling at the expense of ERK, while gain of cavin-3 increases ERK signaling at the expense Akt. Cavin-3 facilitates signal transduction to ERK by anchoring caveolae to the membrane skeleton of the plasma membrane via myosin-1c. Caveolae are lipid raft specializations that contain an ERK activation module and loss of the cavin-3 linkage reduces the abundance of caveolae, thereby separating this ERK activation module from signaling receptors. Loss of cavin-3 promotes Akt signaling through suppression of EGR1 and PTEN. The in vitro consequences of the loss of cavin-3 include induction of Warburg metabolism (aerobic glycolysis), accelerated cell proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis. The in vivo consequences of cavin-3 knockout are increased lactate production and cachexia."

Using both in vivo and in vitro approaches, we show that cavin-3 dictates the balance between ERK and Akt signaling. Loss of cavin-3 increases Akt signaling at the expense of ERK, while gain of cavin-3 increases ERK signaling at the expense Akt. Cavin-3 facilitates signal transduction to ERK by anchoring caveolae to the membrane skeleton of the plasma membrane via myosin-1c. Caveolae are lipid raft specializations that contain an ERK activation module and loss of the cavin-3 linkage reduces the abundance of caveolae, thereby separating this ERK activation module from signaling receptors. Loss of cavin-3 promotes Akt signaling through suppression of EGR1 and PTEN. The in vitro consequences of the loss of cavin-3 include induction of Warburg metabolism (aerobic glycolysis), accelerated cell proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis. The in vivo consequences of cavin-3 knockout are increased lactate production and cachexia."

High levels of cavin-3 promote activation of the ERK signaling pathway but suppress activation of the Akt signaling pathway. Loss of cavin-3 has the opposite effect, activating Akt at the expense of ERK. The consequences of loss of cavin-3 include accelerated cell proliferation, the induction of Warburg metabolism (a metabolic state that supports rapid cell division), and the suppression of the apoptosis pathway. (Suppression of this pathway, which leads to cell death, allows cancer cells to proliferate in the body.) While deletion of the cavin-3 gene in mice is not sufficient to cause spontaneous cancer, animals that are deficient in cavin-3 die prematurely of cachexia, a tissue wasting sequela experienced by nearly half of all cancer patients."

This linkage is necessary to ensure that cells have the correct abundance of caveolae, and it also facilitates signal transduction to the ERK signaling pathway. ERK activation in this context drives expression of two proteins, EGR1 and PTEN, which suppress Akt signaling. Hernandez et al. propose that the membrane skeleton functions as a scaffold that adaptors, such as cavin-3, use to assemble signaling modules with surface receptors for the purpose of controlling the signal transduction output from these receptors."

Many IE transcripts in the first group encoded proteins whose expression is driven by ERK (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). This observation suggested that loss of cavin-3 suppressed ERK signaling and 3 days of knockdown proved sufficient to inhibit EGF-dependent phosphorylation of ERK (pERK), translocation of ERK to the nucleus and induction of the ERK-responsive transcription factor, cFos (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). The impact of cavin-3 depletion on ERK signaling was not specific to EGF because 3-day knockdown also impaired ERK activation by serum and diverse stimuli (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

To identify the mechanism, we queried the IE microarray data and noted that the transcript whose expression showed the greatest suppression following cavin-3 depletion was early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). EGR1 is an ERK-induced transcription factor that drives expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) (<a href=\"#bib96\">Yu et al., 2011</a>). PTEN opposes the action of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) back to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PIP3 generation by PI3K is necessary for the recruitment and activation of Akt (<a href=\"#bib24\">Engelman et al., 2006</a>). Knockdown of cavin-3 caused progressive loss of both EGR1 and PTEN. Loss of EGR1 and PTEN coincided with a fivefold increase in steady state levels of activated Akt (pAkt) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). The switch from ERK to Akt signaling resulted in cell growth that was resistant to the MAPK/ERK Kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, and more sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Loss of cavin-3 potently increased levels of phosphorylated S6K (pS6K) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), indicating that cavin-3 loss activates mTORC1. Microarrays comparing transcript profiles cells depleted of cavin-3 for 0, 3, 8, and 15 days showed that the rapid proliferation of 15-day knockdown cells was associated with substantial changes in gene transcription (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A and 3A</a>). Many of transcripts that were up-regulated in the 15-day knockdowns are part of protein and nucleic acid biosynthetic pathways (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

To increase metabolite levels, some rapidly dividing cells switch to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg metabolism), a metabolic state that is characterized by increased use of fermentative glycolysis even under normoxic conditions (<a href=\"#bib18\">DeBerardinis et al., 2008</a>). Entry into aerobic glycolysis normally requires hypoxia induced factor 1 (HIF1), a transcription factor whose activity is controlled by the protein level of its \u03b1-subunit (HIF1\u03b1) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</a>).

Glucose consumption and lactate production reached rates that were equivalent to those observed in H1299 cells, a non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line that lacks cavin-3 expression (<a href=\"#bib94\">Xu et al., 2001</a>). These findings show that prolonged loss of cavin-3 activates the Akt/mTORC1/HIF1 pathway and induces aerobic glycolysis. Activation of these pathways likely facilitates rapid cell proliferation."

MEK and ERK have been shown to co-fractionate with mitogen receptors and caveolin-1 in cellular membranes of low protein-to-lipid density (<a href=\"#bib54\">Liu et al., 1997</a>). Consistent with these published observations, we found that EGFR, caveolin-1, MEK and ERK co-fractionated in low-density membrane fractions isolated from untreated SV589 fibroblasts; however, knockdown of cavin-3, knockdown of myosin-1c or brief treatment with the actin-depolymerization compound, latrunculin-A, caused MEK and ERK to accumulate in the high-density fractions, which contain the bulk of cellular membrane protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). The distribution of EGFR and caveolin-1 in the gradients became broader and heavier, but the majority of both EGFR and caveolin-1 remained in lighter fractions as compared to MEK and ERK. The EGFR remained on the plasma membrane because EGF treatment induced autophosphorylation of EGFRs in the absence of cavin-3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These observations indicate that a cytoskeletal linkage involving cavin-3, myosin-1c and F-actin positions MEK and ERK for activation by mitogen receptors, most likely by anchoring caveolae at the cell surface."

                                "text": "Cavin-3 associates with caveolae as part of a complex with caveolin-1 and other cavins (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bastiani et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">McMahon et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that caveolin-1 and other cavins may participate in the cavin-3 linkage. Mammalian genomes encode four cavins of which two (cavin-1 and cavin-3) are readily detectable in fibroblasts grown under normal culture conditions. We tested whether cavin-1 and caveolin-1 are components of the cavin-3 linkage using immunoprecipitation with antibodies to myosin-1c and found that in addition to cavin-3 both cavin-1 and caveolin-1 co-precipitated with myosin-1c (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To test whether cavin-1 and caveolin-1 are necessary for the signaling function of the cavin-3 linkage, pERK and pAkt levels were compared in fibroblasts treated with siRNA against cavin-1, cavin-3, caveolin-1 or myosin-1c. Like the cavin-3 and myosin-1c knockdowns, knockdowns of caveolin-1 and cavin-1 increased pAkt at the expense of pERK (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). However, unlike the myosin-1c knockdown, knockdown of cavin-1 reduced the protein level of cavin-3, while knockdown of caveolin-1 reduced protein levels of both cavin-1 and cavin-3. To test whether the effects of cavin-1 and caveolin-1 knockdowns on pERK and pAkt depend upon changes in cavin-3 protein levels, we over-expressed cavin-3 in SV589 fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) and repeated the four knockdowns. Cavin-3 over-expression partially protected cavin-3 levels from knockdown of cavin-1, cavin-3 or caveolin-1. This protection muted the effects of these knockdowns on pERK and pAkt levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). Importantly, cavin-3 levels correlated better with pERK/ERK and pAkt/Akt ratios than did levels of either cavin-1 or caveolin-1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,F,G</a>). The strength of this correlation suggests that cavin-3 is the limiting component of the cavin/caveolin complex for caveolar influence on ERK and Akt signaling. Both caveolin-1 and cavin-1 are required for normal abundance of caveolae (<a href=\"#bib19\">Drab et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Razani et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hill et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Liu et al., 2008</a>). Caveolin-1 is an integral membrane protein that polymerizes to form filaments that coat the cytosolic surface of caveolae (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fernandez et al., 2002</a>). Cavin-1 has been proposed to serve as an adaptor that links other cavins to the caveolin coat (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bastiani et al., 2009</a>). We propose that cavin-3 promotes efficient signal transduction to ERK by bridging between the cavin-1/caveolin-1 complex and myosin-1c (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>)."

To test whether loss of the cavin-3 linkage is necessary for the altered cell signaling, metabolism and apoptosis phenotypes of cancer cells we tested whether reconstitution of the cavin-3 linkage was sufficient to normalize ERK/Akt signaling, cell metabolism and apoptosis. To facilitate this reconstitution, we looked for a cancer cell line that lacks cavin-3, but expresses normal levels of all other linkage components. While many cancer cell lines lack cavin-3 (<a href=\"#bib94\">Xu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bastiani et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lee et al., 2011</a>), some lines such as PC-3 lacked additional linkage components (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bastiani et al., 2009</a>). H1299 cells are a line of non-small cell lung carcinoma cells that lacked detectable cavin-3, but exhibited levels of cavin-1, caveolin-1, myosin-1c and actin that were similar to the endogenous levels of SV589 fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Comparison of the pERK and pAkt responses to mitogens showed that H1299 cells had pERK and pAkt responses that were similar to SV589 fibroblasts following cavin-3 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To reconstitute cavin-3 in H1299 cells, retroviral vectors were used to stably express either GFP alone (H/GFP) or GFP and cavin-3 (H/Cavin-3). Use of a weak promoter-expression system generated levels of cavin-3 expression in H/Cavin-3 cells that were similar to endogenous levels expressed in SV589 fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Re-expression of cavin-3 restored the cavin-3 linkage as evidenced by the ability of myosin-1c antibody to co-precipitate cavin-1, cavin-3, and myosin-1c from lysates of H/Cavin-3 cells, but not H/GFP cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Restoration of the cavin-3 linkage resulted in a 7.6-fold increase in surface caveolae and redistribution of caveolin-1 to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). As compared to parental H1299 or H/GFP cells, H/Cavin-3 cells displayed higher levels of pERK and EGR1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,E</a>); lower levels of pAkt, HIF1\u03b1 and pS6K (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,E</a>); and increased sensitivity to PD98059 and resistance to LY294002 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). These signaling changes correlated with reductions in the rate of cell growth, glucose uptake and lactate production (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>). Cavin-3 re-expression also suppressed survivin levels and sensitized cells to TNF\u03b1-dependent apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,I</a>). These findings show that restoration of the cavin-3 linkage in cancer cells can normalize ERK/Akt signaling, cell metabolism and apoptosis sensitivity."

Interestingly, while expression of either EGR1 or cavin-3 restored PTEN expression to a normal level in Cavin-3 KO MEFs, expression of neither EGR1 nor cavin-3 substantially improved PTEN expression in H1299 cells despite potent suppression of pAkt. The PTEN promoter in H1299 cells is hypermethylated (<a href=\"#bib82\">Soria et al., 2002</a>) and this methylation may limit the ability of EGR1 to drive PTEN expression.

The elevated HIF1\u03b1 of Cavin-3 KO lung tissue was associated with increased fermentative glycolysis ex vivo (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Thus, in vivo loss of cavin-3 promoted Akt signaling at the expense of ERK and increased glycolytic metabolism. However, these signaling changes were not associated with developmental defects, as would be expected if apoptosis were compromised, or hyperplasia, as would be expected if cell proliferation were augmented. Cavin-3 KO mice did have shorter lifespan than control animals (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>) and the principal cause of death was cachexia as exemplified by a 40% reduction in body weight and severe lipodystrophy (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E,F</a>).

Peripheral F-actin is crosslinked by spectrins into a viscoelastic network (the membrane skeleton) that associates with the plasma membrane through diverse linkages. The spatial organization of specific linkages allows the membrane skeleton to generate specializations within the plasma membrane and loss of different organizing linkages results in loss of specific specialized domains (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bennett and Healy, 2008</a>). Our findings show that cavin-3 is part of a linkage necessary for the caveolae specialization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5\u20137</a>). Intriguingly, insulin receptors also associate with F-actin and are enriched at the border between caveolae and the rest of the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib29\">Foti et al., 2007</a>). The combination of a receptor-actin linkage with the cavin-3 linkage suggests that the skeleton assembles mitogen receptors with the caveolar ERK activation module to facilitate signal transduction coupling (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). Other adaptors may link additional downstream signaling modules to the skeleton and different assemblies of receptors and signaling modules may dictate temporal, spatial, and cell-specific responses to common environmental cues. Skeleton-dependent integration of signaling pathways may promote cell differentiation because the sophistication of the skeleton correlates with the degree of cellular differentiation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bennett and Healy, 2008</a>) and defects in the skeleton are associated with dedifferentiation, increased cell proliferation and resistance to anoikis (<a href=\"#bib65\">Mishra et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kumar et al., 2011</a>)."

First, myosin-1c participates in the transport of lipid raft components (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bond et al., 2013</a>) and the use of myosin-1c may couple delivery of caveolar components with caveolae anchorage. Second, caveolae are endocytic structures and myosin-1c may control movement of caveolae vesicles within the cortical actin network. The majority of caveolae-derived vesicles remain at the cell periphery where they re-fuse with the plasma membrane in a cyclic process referred to as potocytosis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Boucrot et al., 2011</a>). Myosin-1c may drive caveolae-derived vesicles back to the cell surface in a calcium-regulated manner because calcium channels are enriched in caveolae (<a href=\"#bib42\">Isshiki et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Pani and Singh, 2009</a>), the Donnan effects generated by endocytosis promote calcium channel opening (<a href=\"#bib77\">Saito et al., 2007</a>) and calcium promotes both myosin-1c motor activity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barylko et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Zhu et al., 1998</a>) and recycling of caveolae-derived vesicles back to the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib51\">Lin et al., 2012</a>).

EGR1 induces PTEN expression (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baron et al., 2006</a>); however, our findings show that induction of PTEN expression is not the only mechanism by which EGR1 suppresses Akt activation. How EGR1 suppresses Akt activation is currently under investigation. Alterations in cavin-3 protein levels have proportionate effects on pERK and pAkt levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>) and the tightness of this correlation may be the result of positive and negative feedback loops involving EGR1 and cavin-3. EGR1 can promote ERK activation (<a href=\"#bib79\">Shen et al., 2011</a>) and ERK activation drives EGR1 expression (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen, 1996</a>). This positive feedback loop requires cavin-3 because both pERK and EGR1 expression are suppressed in the absence of cavin-3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1\u20134, 7</a>). Cavin-3 and EGR1 also act within a negative feedback loop because EGR1 down-regulates cavin-1 and caveolin-1 expression (<a href=\"#bib43\">Joshi et al., 2012</a>) and loss of either cavin-1 or caveolin-1 suppresses cavin-3 expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

Many of these phenotypic effects involve extensive changes in gene expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A and 3A</a>). While the extent of these cellular changes may require some time to complete, our data suggest that more active processes are responsible for the hysteresis. EGR1 protein levels fall slowly during the 15-day time course, despite rapid loss of pERK (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and the short half-life of EGR1 protein (<a href=\"#bib92\">Waters et al., 1990</a>). EGR1 expression can be supported by means other than ERK (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hallahan et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Guillemot et al., 2001</a>) and these mechanisms may slow the loss of EGR1. The gradual loss of EGR1 coincides with gradual increases in survivin, pS6K and HIF1\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The slowly evolving changes in these and other factors likely dictate the time-dependence for the manifestations of resistance to apoptosis, aerobic glycolysis and acceleration in cell proliferation. The length of time required to reach the final phenotypic state also provides a general note of caution with respect to knockdown experiments. siRNA knockdowns are typically assayed 3 days post-transfection; however, our data show that this time window may capture an intermediate state that differs substantially from chronic loss-of-function. Characterization of intermediate states may improve understanding of how proteins such as cavin-3 impact the panoply of cellular processes."

These observations imply that loss of cavin-3 is not sufficient for tumorigenesis. Consistent with this conclusion, loss of cavin-3 expression is more prevalent in late-stage/high-grade cancers than in early-stage/low-grade cancers (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Caren et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Wikman et al., 2012</a>). A potential clue as to the role of cavin-3 in cancer comes from the observation that 35\u201355% of glial, lung, gastric, ovarian, breast, and colorectal cancers show hypermethylation in their cavin-3 promoters (<a href=\"#bib94\">Xu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Zochbauer-Muller et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Martinez et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Tong et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lee et al., 2011</a>). Methylation of the cavin-3 promoter also occurs normally in trophoblasts when they invade the endometrium during pregnancy (<a href=\"#bib33\">Grigoriu et al., 2011</a>). Trophoblast invasion shares many features with cancer cell metastasis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ferretti et al., 2007</a>) and the degree of methylation in the cavin-3 promoter correlates with both trophoblast invasion potential and cancer metastasis (<a href=\"#bib93\">Wikman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">van Dijk et al., 2012</a>). The accelerated cell proliferation, induction of Warburg metabolism and resistance to apoptosis that results from loss of cavin-3 may facilitate the ability of invading cells to survive and proliferate in new environments and may thus provide strong selection for loss of cavin-3 function in cancer cells. Strong selection pressure for loss of cavin-3 in cancer cells is suggested by the observation that while 41% of primary non-small cell lung carcinomas show methylation of their cavin-3 promoters, 81% of these carcinomas (N = 93) lack detectable cavin-3 expression by immunohistochemistry (<a href=\"#bib99\">Zochbauer-Muller et al., 2005</a>).

Loss of cavin-3 linkage components may cause lipodystrophy through selective death in adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib59\">Martin et al., 2012</a>); however, lipid mobilizing factors are elevated in the circulation of Cavin-3 KO animals (data not shown), suggesting that lipolysis is responsible for the loss of triglyceride stores. Cavin-3 KO animals exhibit increased use of fermentative glycolysis (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) and this increase may promote lipolysis for the purpose of clearing lactate. Glycolysis generates lactate and hepatocytes convert lactate back to glucose through the Cori cycle, which fuels the necessary gluconeogenesis via oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids. Loss of caveolae increases flux through the Cori cycle as evidenced by the increased rates of lactate production, hepatic gluconeogenesis and adipocyte lipolysis in <i>Cav1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> (Caveolin-1 KO) mice (<a href=\"#bib4\">Asterholm et al., 2012</a>). Whole body lactate production increases with age (<a href=\"#bib90\">Wallace, 2005</a>) and loss of cavin-3 may exasperate lactate production to a point after which fatty acid demand for gluconeogenesis triggers lipolysis of triglycerides stored in adipose tissue. As lactate production continues to increase, host responses to lactate may drive cannibalization of protein from muscle, which in the absence of cancer is the source of most lactate production. Cancers that commonly elicit cachexia include lung, breast, and colorectal cancers (<a href=\"#bib30\">Fox et al., 2009</a>) and these cancers frequently lack cavin-3 expression (<a href=\"#bib94\">Xu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Zochbauer-Muller et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lee et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the absence of cavin-3 in tumors may predispose patients to the development of cancer-associated cachexia, a condition that is the immediate cause of death for more than 20% of all cancer patients (<a href=\"#bib86\">Tisdale, 2002</a>)."

Many functions have been ascribed to caveolae including mitogen signaling, mechanosensing, nitric oxide signaling, endocytosis, and transcytosis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boscher and Nabi, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kiss, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Mineo and Shaul, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Nassoy and Lamaze, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</a>). Different cavin compositions may support different functions in different cellular settings. We show here that cavin-3 plays a critical role in the signal transduction function of caveolae and that cells, which normally express cavin-3, rely upon cavin-3 for normal ERK and Akt signaling with consequences for cell metabolism, apoptosis, and cell proliferation."

Briefly, cDNAs for human cavin-3 and human EGR1 were subcloned into the pMX-IRES-GFP bicistronic retroviral vector (<a href=\"#bib55\">Liu et al., 1997</a>). Cavin-3, EGR1 or vector control retroviral vectors were co-transfected with the pAmpho packaging vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) into 293T cells to produce infectious, replication-defective retroviruses. Recombinant retroviruses were used to infect H1299 cells, which are a metastatic human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line that does not express detectable cavin-3 (<a href=\"#bib94\">Xu et al., 2001</a>), SV589 fibroblasts and Cavin-3 KO MEFs. The IRES element allows both the gene of interest and GFP to be translated from the same mRNA and thus cells that express GFP also express the gene of interest following successful genomic integration of the virus. GFP positive cells were purified using two rounds of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) with a BD FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). Two rounds of sorting generated populations that were at least 96% GFP positive."

From clones #F7 (3.2 kb DNA fragment) and #R7 (4.1 kb DNA fragment), an aligned 7.0 kb DNA fragment covering the full <i>Prkcdbp</i> (Cavin-3) gene including both exon1 and exon 2 was assembled and confirmed by sequencing with the mouse genome database (MGI). A pJB1 cassette vector expressing the neomycin resistant gene (Neo<sup>r</sup>) flanked by two LoxP sites (a gift from Joachim Herz, UTSW) was used to construct the Cavin-3 targeting vector using three steps. (i) The 1.2 kb Avr II-Xho I fragment (short arm, SA) from genomic clone #F7 was subcloned into the Xba I-Xho I sites of the pBS2-SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), then subcloned using Not I into pJB1 to generate pJB1/SA. (ii) The 3.7 kb Xho I fragment (long arm, LA) from the full length Cavin-3 clone was subcloned into the Xho I site of pJB1 to generate pJB1/LA. (iii) The 7.0 kb Bam HI-Pac I fragment cut from clone pJB1/SA4, was ligated with the 8.0 kb Bam HI-Pac I fragment cut from clone pJB1/LA9 to complete the Cavin-3 targeting vector construction."

In response to these comments, the following data have been added to the resubmission: (1) Edge analysis of the IE microarray data. This analysis illustrates that depletion of cavin-3 suppresses expression of ERK-induced transcripts. (2) Knockdowns of cavin-1, cavin-3, caveolin-1 and myosin-1c in SV589 fibroblasts over-expressing cavin-3. Comparisons of pERK/ERK and pAkt/Akt vs cavin-3 level in this data set together with that of the prior data set using SV589 fibroblasts expressing endogenous levels of cavin-3 show that pERK/ERK and pAkt/Akt levels correlate with the level of cavin-3, but not the levels of cavin-1 or caveolin-1. This finding indicates that the cavin-3 component of the cavin/caveolin complex dictates the pERK/pAkt ratio. (3) Immunoprecipitation data using H/GFP and H/Cavin-3 cells. These data show that the association of cavin-1 and caveolin-1 with myosin-1c requires the presence of cavin-3. (4) Time courses of pERK/pAkt responses to EGF for SV589 fibroblasts, SV589 fibroblasts treated with cavin-3 siRNA, PC-3 and H1299 cells. (5) pS6K/S6K data for the knockdown, MEF and H1299 models. These data show that loss of cavin-3 activates mTORC1 and that cavin-3 normally suppresses mTORC1 via EGR1. (6) Glucose uptake and lactate production for EGR1 and cavin-3 reconstitutions in the MEF and H1299 models. These data show that cavin-3 suppresses aerobic glycolysis via EGR1. (7) TNF\u03b1 sensitivity for the EGR1 and cavin-3 reconstitutions in the MEF and H1299 models. These data show that cavin-3 drives an essential process for TNF\u03b1-dependent apoptosis that is EGR1-independent. In order to accommodate the new data, the figures have been restructured.

The original submission provided immunoblots, ERK/Akt quantification and caveolin-1 immunofluorescence data in cells stably expressing either EGR1 or cavin-3 under control of a viral promoter. In the resubmission, we now provide cell metabolism and apoptosis data for the rescue experiments in both the MEF and H1299 models. This additional data now show that cavin-3 expression is sufficient to fully normalize both H1299 and MEF models, but that EGR1 expression is only able to normalize Akt/mTORC1/HIF1 signaling and cell metabolism. EGR1 is unable to normalize sensitivity to TNF\u03b1. This new finding suggests that cavin-3 supports an EGR1-independent process that is necessary for TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis. The EGR1-independent process may involve caveolae or pERK, neither of which are normalized by EGR1 expression."

Because this proteomic screen did not distinguish between caveolae and lipid rafts, we used literature data to exclude proteins that did not co-localize with caveolae. Myosin heavy chain forms filaments that pull on actin stress fibers, but caveolae are not associated with actin stress fibers. Myosin-X and myosin-XV are localized to filopodia, but caveolae are not. Myosin-1a is localized to brush borders, but caveolae are not. Talin is localized to cell adhesions, but caveolae are not. \u03b1-catenin participates in actin bundling but does not show strong caveolae co-localization. Cofilin is an actin disassembly factor. Tossing these proteins left myosin-1c and ezrin. Both proteins co-localized with caveolae, but only knockdown of myosin-1c was able to phenocopy the effects of cavin-3 knockdown on pERK. Subsequent experiments (co-IP, cell fractionation) validated a role for myosin-1c in the cavin-3 linkage."

First, loss of cavin-3 suppresses pERK levels \u223c4-fold but does not eliminate pERK. Second, genetic loss of both ERK1 and ERK2 is lethal, but loss of cavin-3 is not. Third, not all cells that elicit pERK responses have caveolae. For example neurons and hepatocytes have few caveolae, but are able to mount ERK responses to trophic factors. Fourth, not all caveolae are equivalent. Caveolae of adipocytes have abundant cavin-2, myocyte caveolae have high levels of cavin-4 and endothelial caveolae are varied in their composition. What our data says is that for cells that normally express cavin-3, cavin-3 is necessary for a normal pAkt/pERK ratio with consequences for cell growth, metabolism and apoptosis. Of key significance is that epithelial cells appear to be a cell type that uses cavin-3 for this purpose and we show that reconstitution of cavin-3 in carcinoma cells that have lost cavin-3 expression is sufficient to normalize Akt/ERK signaling, cell metabolism, cell growth and sensitivity to TNF\u03b1. Given that loss of cavin-3 expression is widespread in cancer cells, loss of cavin-3 linkage function may be a common mechanism by which cancer cells achieve an Akt-dominated state that exhibits Warburg metabolism, rapid cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. We are beginning to look at other cell types to address the generality of the role we observe for cavin-3 in ERK and Akt signaling. The last paragraph of the Discussion now discusses the generality of our results."

H1299 cells suppress PTEN through promoter methylation and neither cavin-3 nor EGR1 was capable of substantially increasing PTEN levels, yet both cavin-3 and EGR1 normalized pAkt levels. We hypothesize that EGR1 drives expression of other proteins that inhibit Akt activation and are starting to explore how this suppression works using candidates identified in our microarray data. Regarding PC-3 cells, we chose not to pursue this cell line because these cells lack cavin-1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> in the resubmission) and loss of cavin-1 suppresses cavin-3 levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). PC-3 cells are of interest to us for future experiments both because these cells lack all four cavins, which will facilitate isogenic reconstitution experiments, and because caveolin-1 promotes cell migration and metastasis in PC-3 cells. Loss of cavin-3 is associated with both cancer cell metastasis and trophoblast migration and loss of cavin-3 may drive caveolin-1 into a process that facilitates cell migration. A discussion of additional mechanisms beyond PTEN protein level is now provided in both the Results and Discussion."

Myosin-1c binds to negatively charged cargos and we suspect that these phosphorylations provide the complementary charges that drive myosin-1c interaction with cavin-3; however, until we know which residues must be phosphorylated and whether aspartate/glutamate substitutions can substitute for phosphorylation we cannot begin to test for direct interactions with purified proteins."

Myosin-1c knockdown by contrast had little effect on cavin-1, cavin-3 or caveolin-1 level despite near maximal effect on pERK and pAkt levels. These observations indicate that cavin-3 and myosin-1c provide limiting activities that are necessary for normal ERK and Akt signaling.

This published literature together with our data led to our proposal that cavin-3 bridges between the cavin-1/caveolin-1 complex and myosin-1/F-actin. Additional support for this conclusion comes from <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, which as described in the response to critique 8, shows that cavin-3 is necessary for the ability of antibodies to myosin-1c to co-precipitate cavin-1 and caveolin-1.
