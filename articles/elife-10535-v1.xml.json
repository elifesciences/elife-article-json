But this is not true in the case of the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">xkcd, 2007</a>). Adult flies forage for microbes on overripe fruit, relying on their sense of smell to detect the acetic acid (the chemical that gives vinegar its pungent aroma) that accumulates as the fruit ferments. However, flies tend to ignore or even avoid both low levels of vinegar (which suggest that the fruit is not ripe enough) and high levels of vinegar (which suggest that the fruit might be rotten)."

Their data also show that starvation has a more nuanced influence on the early processing of olfactory information than was previously anticipated: hunger does more than just tune up the flies' sensitivity to food odors. Instead, it triggers specific responses (both excitatory and inhibitory) that encourage the flies to forage on sub-optimal food sources. In doing so, Ko et al. possibly provide additional evidence to support the notion that it is not wise to go grocery shopping on an empty stomach, lest hunger signals may impair your ability to discriminate good food from bad."

In fruit flies, much like in humans and other vertebrates, the olfactory neurons that detect specific volatile chemicals wire up to discrete clusters of synapses within the brain called glomeruli. Olfactory neurons that detect the same chemical all connect to the same glomerulus. Depending on the concentration, vinegar odor activates 6 to 8 of the 40 or so glomeruli in the fruit fly brain. However, a previous landmark study from the Wang group revealed that the activity of a single olfactory glomerulus, referred to as DM1, could explain most of a fly's attraction to vinegar (<a href=\"#bib3\">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</a>). Turning off the receptors that connect to DM1 caused the flies to ignore the odor of vinegar. On the other hand, restoring only the activity of DM1 neurons in otherwise \u2018anosmic\u2019 flies (that is, flies that have lost almost all sense of smell) was enough to make them attracted to vinegar again."

Hence, the competitive interaction between DM1 and DM5 (which are activated at different vinegar odor concentrations) may ultimately determine whether the fly decides to approach a potential food source or to stay away."

The hormone insulin indirectly mediates this effect. Starvation causes insulin levels to plummet, triggering a chain of events that ultimately causes DM1 olfactory neurons to increase the expression of a specific receptor protein. This receptor detects a signaling molecule called \u2018short neuropeptide F\u2019. Upon binding to the receptor, this neuropeptide effectively amplifies, or turns up the \u2018gain\u2019 of, DM1 activity. Since DM1 neurons control a fruit fly's attraction to vinegar, this finding seemed to elegantly explain how insulin signaling can lead hungry flies to look more widely for food."

By extending the range of odor concentrations tested, Ko et al. now find that this mechanism only explains how hungry flies boost their attraction to low vinegar odor concentrations. At higher concentrations, starved flies still pursue vinegary food more robustly than fed controls, even when signaling mediated by short neuropeptide F is reduced (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ko et al., 2015</a>). Could an additional neuropeptide account for this difference? To search for this missing hunger signal, Ko et al. surveyed other receptor proteins, looking for those that were increased in sensory neurons as a result of starvation. The Tachykinin receptor (called DTKR for short) emerged as a strong candidate, especially because it was known that it can tune down the responses of the fly's olfactory neurons (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ignell et al., 2009</a>)."

Similarly, DM5 (the glomerulus responsible for avoidance of high levels of vinegar) was less active in starved flies, but its activity could be brought back up to that of a fed fly when DTKR was knocked-down. Finally, Ko et al. identified insulin as the likely signal that acts upstream of DTKR in starving flies."

One helps the transmission of signals at the DM1 glomerulus, which makes the flies more sensitive to attractive food odors. In parallel, the other turns down transmission at DM5, which makes the flies less likely to avoid normally unpleasant or aversive smells. Together, these systems allow flies to pursue less-than-optimal food sources in times of shortage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

                                "text": "Vinegar (or acetic acid) is the ultimate product of the fermentation process in fruit, which is why fruit flies are attracted to vinegar odor. However, both low and high concentrations of vinegar odor leave flies indifferent (left). This is because low concentrations indicate that the fruit is just-ripe (green banana), whereas high concentrations mean that it is rotten (brown banana). Hungry flies behave differently because the low levels of insulin caused by starvation trigger two distinct neuropeptide signaling systems that reshape their olfactory responses (right). In hungry flies, the receptor for short neuropeptide F (called sNPFR) is upregulated in a subset of olfactory neurons. This helps the transmission of signals within the DM1 glomerulus, which increases the sensitivity to low concentrations of attractive food odors. In parallel, elevated Tachykinin signaling (through the DTKR receptor) inhibits the transmission of signals within the DM5 glomerulus. This decreases the avoidance of normally unpleasant smells (such as high concentrations of vinegar). Together these effects allow the pursuit of less-than-optimal food sources (depicted by the green arrows pointing toward the just-ripe and rotten bananas). DM1 and DM5 are specific glomeruli found in the antennal lobe (AL) of the fly brain and their color intensity represents the strength of their activation in fed vs hungry flies."

From clever behavioral assays, to sophisticated genetic manipulations and imaging of brain activity, the work describes how an important sensory cue is handled in different ways depending on the internal state of the animal (that is, hungry or not). Since what is true for the fly is often\u2014at least in outline\u2014true for man, the area of research is now ripe to contribute principles of sensory processing that may be applicable to many, if not all, animal species."
