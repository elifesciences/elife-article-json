It requires recruitment of outer kinetochore microtubule binders by centromere proteins C and T (CENP-C and CENP-T). To study the molecular requirements of kinetochore formation, we reconstituted the binding of the MIS12 and NDC80 outer kinetochore subcomplexes to CENP-C and CENP-T. Whereas CENP-C recruits a single MIS12:NDC80 complex, we show here that CENP-T binds one MIS12:NDC80 and two NDC80 complexes upon phosphorylation by the mitotic CDK1:Cyclin B complex at three distinct CENP-T sites. Visualization of reconstituted complexes by electron microscopy supports this model. Binding of CENP-C and CENP-T to MIS12 is competitive, and therefore CENP-C and CENP-T act in parallel to recruit two MIS12 and up to four NDC80 complexes. Our observations provide a molecular explanation for the stoichiometry of kinetochore components and its cell cycle regulation, and highlight how outer kinetochore modules bridge distances of well over 100 nm."

It requires recruitment of outer kinetochore microtubule binders by centromere proteins C and T (CENP-C and CENP-T). To study the molecular requirements of kinetochore formation, we reconstituted the binding of the MIS12 and NDC80 outer kinetochore subcomplexes to CENP-C and CENP-T. Whereas CENP-C recruits a single MIS12:NDC80 complex, we show here that CENP-T binds one MIS12:NDC80 and two NDC80 complexes upon phosphorylation by the mitotic CDK1:Cyclin B complex at three distinct CENP-T sites. Visualization of reconstituted complexes by electron microscopy supports this model. Binding of CENP-C and CENP-T to MIS12 is competitive, and therefore CENP-C and CENP-T act in parallel to recruit two MIS12 and up to four NDC80 complexes. Our observations provide a molecular explanation for the stoichiometry of kinetochore components and its cell cycle regulation, and highlight how outer kinetochore modules bridge distances of well over 100 nm."

The affinity of the kinetochore for microtubules in the KMN is predominantly mediated by the NDC80 complex, a heterotetramer with an approximately 50 nm long coiled coil region that separates the microtubule-binding calponin homology (CH) domains of the NDC80 and NUF2 subunits from the SPC24 and SPC25 subunits (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ciferri et al., 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib58\">Wei et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ciferri et al., 2008</a>).

Studying the respective contribution of CENP-C and CENP-T to outer kinetochore assembly, however, has been complicated by their interdependent localization and their distinct regulation by post-translational modifications. Experiments that targeted either CENP-C or CENP-T to an ectopic chromatin array uncoupled these requirements and demonstrated the ability of both pathways to recruit outer kinetochore components (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gascoigne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hori et al., 2013</a>). An important conclusion from these previous studies is that CENP-C and CENP-T recruit NDC80C in distinct ways (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The CENP-C-dependent axis, which is now understood in detail, relies on a direct interaction of CENP-C with the MIS12 complex (MIS12C) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Screpanti et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Przewloka et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dimitrova et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Petrovic et al., 2016</a>), which further recruits NDC80C via a direct interaction (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cheeseman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Petrovic et al., 2010</a>)."

This may appear surprising, because MIS12C and CENP-T bind to NDC80C in a competitive manner (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schleiffer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Nishino et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that they can only recruit NDC80C independently from each other.

It is also plausible that crucial regulatory aspects of kinetochore-microtubule attachment, such as the tension-dependent regulation required for correcting erroneous attachments or for stabilization of correct ones, depend on the effective number and distribution of linkages, as recently proposed in elegant modeling studies (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zaytsev et al., 2014</a>).

In this study, we address instead the composition and regulation of the interactions between CCAN and the outer kinetochore, focusing on the interactions of CENP-T, MIS12C, and NDC80C. CDK1:Cyclin B phosphorylation reactions with systematically mutated CENP-T substrates revealed that the phosphorylation of CENP-T at Thr11 and Thr85 results in the recruitment of two NDC80Cs. We also report that CENP-T interacts directly with MIS12C. This requires phosphorylation of CENP-T at Ser201, which is encompassed within a non-canonical CDK1 consensus sequence. This CENP-T-bound MIS12C recruits additional NDC80C and KNL1C complexes. Importantly, CENP-C and CENP-T bind MIS12C in a competitive manner and form separate outer kinetochore recruitment modules. Thus, we have reconstituted and visualized the molecular basis of CENP-T mediated assembly of the outer kinetochore and its phospho-regulation."

Previous studies identified multiple phosphorylation sites in CENP-T and showed that its phosphorylation contributes to the recruitment of NDC80C (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gascoigne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kettenbach et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gascoigne and Cheeseman, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Nishino et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rago et al., 2015</a>). Confirming this, we identified by mass spectrometry numerous residues in CENP-T that were in vitro phosphorylated by CDK1:Cyclin B (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). These included the CDK target sites Thr11, Thr27, Ser47, and Thr85 in the N-terminal region of CENP-T, a region known to interact with the SPC24:SPC25 subunits of NDC80C (<a href=\"#bib33\">Malvezzi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Nishino et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We used isothermal titration calorimetry to test the ability of four short synthetic phosphopeptides encompassing these residues to bind SPC24:SPC25. Peptides containing phosphorylated Thr11 or Thr85 showed a binding affinity of 45 \u03bcM and 4 \u03bcM, respectively, whereas peptides containing phosphorylated Thr27 or Ser47 did not show an interaction with SPC24:SPC25 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Although the determined affinities are modest and unlikely to fully represent the binding affinities between full-length CENP-T and SPC24:SPC25, they distinguish <i>bona fide</i> binding sites from sites that do not interact."

We next generated a set of CENP-T<sup>2-101</sup> constructs in which three of the four CDK phosphorylation sites were mutated to Alanine. Constructs retaining either Thr11 or Thr85 bound to SPC24:SPC25 in a phosphorylation dependent manner, whereas constructs retaining either Thr27 or Ser47, or having all four sites mutated to Alanine, did not bind SPC24:SPC25 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Phosphorylation of CENP-T at Thr11 or Thr85 is thus sufficient to bind SPC24:SPC25. These results are consistent with in vivo experiments showing that ectopic chromosome anchoring of a CENP-T<sup>1-250</sup> fragment results in the recruitment of NDC80C when either Thr11 or Thr85 were mutated to Alanine, but not when both were mutated (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rago et al., 2015</a>)."

This possibility is supported by the change in retention volume and the apparent stoichiometry of the CENP-T<sup>2-101</sup>:SPC24:SPC25 complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We set out to test the stoichiometry of CENP-T:SPC24:SPC25 complexes further using a CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> fragment that we C-terminally labeled with a fluorescent dye to specifically follow CENP-T during chromatography and SDS-PAGE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This is helpful because CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup>, which lacks Tryptophan and has only one Tyrosine, absorbs poorly at 280 nm. Fluorescently labeled CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> (hereafter CENP-T) was in vitro phosphorylated by CDK1:Cyclin B and subsequently incubated with a threefold molar excess of SPC24:SPC25. CENP-T was part of a broad peak with two SPC24:SPC25-containing species with approximate retention volumes of 1.2 and 1.35 ml (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, green traces). Consistent with the idea that the complex eluting at 1.2 mL contained two SPC24:SPC25 molecules per CENP-T, this species was not observed for CENP-T containing the T11A or the T85A mutation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, orange traces). CENP-T that was mutated at both Thr11 and Thr85 or that was not phosphorylated, did not form a complex with SPC24:SPC25 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, red and black traces)."

We next set out to visualize these assemblies directly by electron microscopy (EM) after low-angle metal shadowing. This technique enhances the contrast of the coiled-coil regions of NDC80C, enabling a characterization of the overall dimensions of complexes containing NDC80C. The coiled-coil of NDC80C spans 51 nm and the NDC80:NUF2 - SPC24:SPC25 end-to-end length is 62 nm (corrected for an estimated 3 nm shadow contribution at both ends) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This is slightly longer than the 57 nm of yeast NDC80C previously determined using the same technique (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wei et al., 2005</a>). The difference might be explained by the use of full-length human NDC80C whereas the used yeast version lacked the N-terminal 100 residues of the Ndc80p subunit, although interspecies or technical differences cannot be excluded. The low-resolution and the flexible appearance of the NDC80C prevent unambiguous assignment of the SPC24:SPC25 and the NDC80:NUF2 modules of the complexes, although a clear kink in the coiled coil, previously attributed to a sequence insertion in NDC80 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ciferri et al., 2008</a>) marks NDC80:NUF2 in a number of cases (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We were able to distinguish at least two different kinds of complexes, containing either one or two NDC80Cs. Though it is not possible to ascertain if complexes with one discernible NDC80 contain CENP-T, those containing two NDC80Cs are presumably assembled on phosphorylated CENP-T. This interpretation is further supported by the distance between the base of the complexes and the characteristic kinks in the coiled coil of NDC80:NUF2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The apparent orientation of the two CENP-T-bound NDC80Cs widely varies, presumably because the CENP-T<sup>11-85</sup> stretch spanning the two NDC80C binding sites is flexible. In brief, we visualized how CENP-T recruits two NDC80Cs. The SPC24:SPC25 modules of these complexes are coordinated by the relative proximity of the phosphorylated Thr11 and Thr85 of CENP-T, but the microtubule-binding CH domains can be well over 100 nm apart."

Consistent with these previous reports, MIS12C bound SPC24:SPC25, displacing CENP-T<sup>2-101</sup>, already at equimolar concentrations, indicative of higher binding affinity (unpublished data). In apparent contradiction with these observations, however, it has also been reported that the phosphorylation of human CENP-T on Thr195, within a weakly conserved CDK1 consensus motif (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), contributes to the recruitment of MIS12C to CENP-T in vivo (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rago et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, the CENP-T<sup>200-230</sup> region has been identified as a crucial determinant of the CENP-T:MIS12C interaction in vivo (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rago et al., 2015</a>), indicating that residues downstream of Thr195 are also important for MIS12C binding."

The peptide carrying phosphorylated Ser201 bound directly to MIS12C in vitro, whereas the equivalent peptide containing phosphorylated Thr195 did not (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The importance of CENP-T phosphorylation at position Ser201 was recapitulated for the longer CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> construct, where mutation of this residue was shown to abrogate binding to MIS12C (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Phosphorylation of CENP-T at position Ser201 is thus both required and sufficient to mediate the MIS12C:CENP-T interaction in vitro. Although our results leave open the possibility that Ser201 is phosphorylated in vitro by a contaminating kinase, rather than by CDK1:Cyclin B, several factors contribute to mitigate this concern. First, the CDK1:Cyclin B sample we used is highly pure (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>) and devoid of other Ser/Thr kinases, as judged by mass spectrometry (unpublished data). Second, phosphorylation of CENP-T Ser201 was also observed using a commercial CDK1:Cyclin B preparation (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Third, the addition of the CDK1 specific inhibitor RO-3306 abolished the overall phosphorylation of CENP-T by CDK1:Cyclin B (as judged by the migration of CENP-T on SDS-PAGE, <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). Finally, RO-3306 prevented the specific phosphorylation of CENP-T at Ser201 and inhibited the CENP-T:MIS12C interaction, <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>)."

As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gascoigne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rago et al., 2015</a>), NDC80C and MIS12C were recruited to CENP-T loci in prometaphase and not in interphase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), in agreement with the observed CDK1-dependent recruitment of these complexes to CENP-T in vitro (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). The NDC80C binding mutant CENP-T<sup>T11A-T85A</sup> binds MIS12C in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), but in the context of a LacI-EGFP fusion, it failed to recruit not only NDC80C, but also MIS12C, to the <i>lacO</i> locus, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rago et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). CENP-T<sup>S201A</sup>, on the other hand, recruited NDC80C to the <i>lacO</i> array, but no longer interacted with MIS12C (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This result is consistent with the requirement for phosphorylation of Ser201 for MIS12C recruitment in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), and with the previous identification of the CENP-T<sup>200-230</sup> region as a crucial determinant of the CENP-T:MIS12C interaction in vivo (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rago et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, an alanine mutant of Thr195 of CENP-T prevented recruitment of both the MIS12C and the NDC80C to the ectopic <i>lacO</i> site, even if this residue is dispensable for MIS12C or NDC80C binding in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We therefore speculate that Thr195 contributes to the efficiency of phosphorylation or to the stability of CENP-T in vivo, an effect that is not recapitulated in vitro, where this residue appears to be dispensable for MIS12C binding. Overall, our data underline the importance of Ser201 of CENP-T as a MIS12C binding site both in vitro and in vivo."

Phosphorylated CENP-T integrated in large complexes whose elution volume from the SEC column was smaller than that of MIS12:NDC80 complexes. Our set of CENP-T mutants enabled a systematic analysis of these CENP-T:MIS12C:NDC80C assemblies. In addition to recapitulating observations made for CENP-T:NDC80C (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and CENP-T:MIS12C (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), these experiments showed that CENP-T with mutated NDC80C-binding motifs (T11A and T85A) still associated with MIS12C:NDC80C (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, red trace). This association strictly depended on the phosphorylation of CENP-T at Ser201 because the CENP-T triple mutant (T11A, T85A, S201A) no longer formed a complex with MIS12C or NDC80C (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, purple trace). Collectively, our results demonstrate that 1) CENP-T<sup>wt</sup> associates with MIS12C and NDC80C in 1:1:3 ratio; 2) CENP-T<sup>T11A</sup> or CENP-T<sup>T85A</sup> associate with MIS12C and NDC80C in 1:1:2 ratio; and 3) CENP-T<sup>T11A-T85A</sup> associates with MIS12C and NDC80C in 1:1:1 ratio. The behavior of the complete set of CENP-T mutants upon incubation with MIS12C and/or NDC80C is displayed in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, MIS12C that interacts with CENP-T phosphorylated at Ser201 can also interact with NDC80C. This complex was also able to incorporate KNL1C, indicating that it can bind an entire KMN assembly, as is the case for MIS12C bound to CENP-C (<a href=\"#bib42\">Petrovic et al., 2016</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

CENP-C binds at the interface of Head1 and the helical connector, two structural elements of MIS12C. This interface is stabilized by Tyr8, Phe12, and Phe13 in the \u03b10 helix of the Mis12 subunit and mutation of these three aromatic residues to alanine (MIS12C<sup>3xA</sup>) abolished the binding of MIS12C with CENP-C (<a href=\"#bib42\">Petrovic et al., 2016</a>).

The molecular mechanism behind the contribution of CENP-T to MIS12C localization at the kinetochore, however, had remained unclear, and it appeared puzzling in view of observations that MIS12C and CENP-T bind to NDC80C in a competitive manner (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schleiffer et al., 2012</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib37\">Nishino et al., 2013</a>). A role for the CENP-T<sup>200-230</sup> region in MIS12C recruitment was shown in experiments of ectopic chromatin targeting of CENP-T fragments, which revealed that MIS12C was recruited to CENP-T<sup>1-230</sup> but not to CENP-T<sup>1-200</sup> (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rago et al., 2015</a>). Our observation that the phosphorylation of Ser201 is essential for the CENP-T:MIS12C interaction in vitro is consistent with these previous observations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Phosphorylation of the weakly conserved CDK consensus site Thr195 is important for the CENP-T:MIS12C interaction in vivo (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#bib46\">Rago et al., 2015</a>), but is not required in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). A possible explanation for these results is that the phosphorylation of kinetochore-associated CENP-T at Thr195 is required for the phosphorylation of Ser201 and the subsequent binding of MIS12C. Multisite phosphorylation networks are important for the regulation of mitosis by CDK1 kinase (<a href=\"#bib28\">K\u00f5ivom\u00e4gi et al., 2011</a>) and future experiment will be required to understand the spatial and temporal regulation of CENP-T phosphorylation in vivo. Why the CENP-T T195A mutation also interfered with CENP-T:NDC80C recruitment to ectopic <i>lacO</i> loci in our hands (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) but not in a previous study (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rago et al., 2015</a>) is unclear, but is consistent with a role of this residue in the overall phosphorylation or stability of CENP-T. Our observation that the double mutant CENP-T<sup>T11A-T85A</sup> was unable to recruit MIS12C to <i>lacO</i> loci agrees with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rago et al., 2015</a>), and indicates that binding of NDC80C to CENP-T facilitates further recruitment of MIS12C (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The molecular basis for this phenomenon is currently unclear and will require further investigation. So far, we have been unable to recapitulate this effect with purified components."

Because the pseudo-symmetry of the CENP-A nucleosomes allows its binding to two CCAN modules (<a href=\"#bib59\">Weir et al., 2016</a>), we propose that mitotic phosphorylation events trigger the recruitment of four MIS12Cs (and KNL1C) and up to eight NDC80Cs per CENP-A mononucleosome (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This extrapolation of our reconstitution experiments is in line with a series of quantitative analyses of kinetochore subcomplexes by immunofluorescence microscopy. Copy numbers of CENP-C, CENP-T, MIS12C, and NDC80C were most accurately determined for metaphase kinetochores in a study that combined RNA interference, ectopic and endogenous kinetochore recruitment, and an elegant CENP-C/T chimera protein design (<a href=\"#bib53\">Suzuki et al., 2015a</a>). This analysis revealed that, on average, 215 copies of CENP-C and 72 copies of CENP-T recruit a total of 244 NDC80Cs and 151 MIS12Cs to a kinetochore. However, only 82 (of the 215) CENP-C proteins engage in binding MIS12C, whereas the remaining CENP-C does not contribute to outer kinetochore recruitment. CENP-T is responsible for the recruitment of the remaining MIS12Cs and NDC80Cs (<a href=\"#bib53\">Suzuki et al., 2015a</a>). These results correlate well to our description of 1:1:1 CENP-C:MIS12C:NDC80C and 1:1:2 or 1:1:3 CENP-T:MIS12C:NDC80C assemblies."

Our study paves the way to the reconstitution of synthetic kinetochores with controllable numbers of NDC80 complexes, which will in turn allow us to probe the importance of multivalency for force production by kinetochores. Whether the CDK-regulated localization of multiple NDC80Cs at the outer kinetochore has an effect on the function of kinetochores to signal the microtubule-attachment state through the spindle checkpoint control also remains to be addressed. In this perspective, it is interesting to note that NDC80C recruited by CENP-C:MIS12C or by CENP-T have been proposed to have different effects on the checkpoint response (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kim and Yu, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Samejima et al., 2015</a>)."

It also showed the varying orientation of the coordinated NDC80Cs relative to each other, presumably caused by the flexibility of the CENP-T regions between the NDC80C and MIS12C binding sites. The flexibility of CENP-T as well as the stretching of CENP-T upon kinetochore-microtubule contacts has been shown before: the N- and C-termini of tagged CENP-T were\u00a0~30 nm apart in the presence of tension (MG132 treated cells) but only\u00a0~4 nm apart in the absence of tension (nocodazole treated cells), as determined by immunofluorescence and immuno-electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib54\">Suzuki et al., 2011</a>).

Flp-In T-REx HeLa cells carrying the EGFP transgene (<a href=\"#bib29\">Krenn et al., 2012</a>) were maintained in DMEM (PAN Biotech) supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free FBS (Clontech) in the absence of doxycycline, penicillin and streptomycin (GIBCO) and 2 mM L-glutamine (PAN Biotech). Cells were treated with 330 nM nocodazole (Sigma) for 16 hr and mitotic cells were harvested by shake off and lysed by incubation in lysis buffer [150 mM KCl, 75 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% glycerol, 90 U/ml benzonase (Sigma) and 0.1% NP-40 supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Serva) and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitors (Roche)]. Clarified extracts were pre-cleared with protein A\u2013Sepharose (CL-4B; GE Healthcare) for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C before a 2 hr incubation with anti-CENP-T/W antibody (<a href=\"#bib4\">Basilico et al., 2014</a>) cross-linked to protein A-beads. Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer containing NP-40 0.2%, twice with lysis buffer without detergents and twice with water. Samples were reduced, alkylated and digested with LysC and Trypsin and prepared for mass spectrometry as previously described (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rappsilber et al., 2007</a>). Immunoprecipitated samples were digested directly from the beads whereas in vitro phosphorylated CENP-T samples were digested in solution. Obtained peptides were separated on an EASY-nLC 1000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Odense, Denmark) using a 45 min gradient from 5\u201360% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid and directly sprayed via a nano-electrospray source in a quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Michalski et al., 2011</a>). The Q Exactive was operated in a\u00a0data-dependent mode acquiring one survey scan and subsequently ten MS/MS scans. To identify phospho-sites, the resulting raw files were processed with MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.18) searching for CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> (in vitro samples) or the uniprot human database (in vivo samples) with deamidation (NQ), oxidation (M) and phosphorylation (STY) as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation (C) as fixed modification. A false discovery rate cut off of 1% was applied at the peptide and protein levels and as well on the site decoy fraction (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cox and Mann, 2008</a>)."

The authors used recombinant proteins to demonstrate that CENP-T will bind to Ndc80 and to Mis12-Ndc80 after phosphorylation in vitro using Cyclin B-Cdk1. They identify the phosphorylation sites and show which sites are responsible for binding Ndc80 and Mis12. They use a combination of biochemical and electron microscopy assays to estimate the stoichiometry of the complexes generated and present evidence that CENP-T can bind directly to two molecules of Ndc80 via phospho-threonines 11 and 85, and to one molecule of Mis12 via phospho-serine 201. CENP-C can compete for Mis12 binding to this latter site. Many of the main conclusions have been reported recently in other work. For example, two papers from the Westermann lab (PMIDs: 27524485 and 23334295) and a paper from the Fukagawa lab (PMID: 23334297) previously identified the N-terminal Ndc80 binding peptides in CENP-T and its budding yeast equivalent. Thus, the data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> is not new. The clear demonstration of the stoichiometry of binding of two Ndc80 molecules to CENP-T in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a> is nice, but as these two binding peptides are in distinct regions of the molecule and are each sufficient for Ndc80 binding, this is not a particular surprise. We also note that the recent paper from the Westermann lab showed similar data for the budding yeast CENP-T protein, including similar EM images to show the multiple Ndc80 complexes bound (PMID: 27524485)."

In particular S201 is followed by a valine and from the crystal structures of Cdk1 and Cdk2 it is difficult to envisage how this would bind since their active sites have a bulky residue that in almost all substrates requires a proline to for the peptide chain to fit. From the Materials and methods, it appears that the authors used insect cell produced cyclin B-Cdk1 raising the possibility that S201 was phosphorylated by a contaminated kinase. It will be important to eliminate this possibility before publication."

Based on the presented biochemistry and binding assays, it looks like CDK phosphorylation is fully efficient for promoting the interaction with the Mis12 complex. However, as this would be a non-traditional consensus site for CDK, one would expect its phosphorylation to be substantially less efficient than the other sites in CENP-T. A labeling-based strategy to measure the efficiency of phosphorylation at this site would provide allow the authors to assess the potential relevance of this site."

Moreover, what the authors data show is that the serine 201 residue is important for binding to the Mis12 complex. They do not show that the phospho-regulation of this site is key. For example, if they were instead to mutate the neighboring valine or glutamine, this could also block an interaction with the Mis12 complex as they may participate in mediating the interaction. In addition, it would be very useful if the authors could refine the requirements for this binding. All of the binding experiments use an extended portion of CENP-T. If Mis12 complex binding occurs in a limited region (and only requires phosphorylation at the serine 201 residue), they should be able to substantially narrow this binding region."

The authors should determine the affinity between phospho-CENP-T and Mis12C. If they cannot obtain enough phospho-CENP-T for this measurement, they should attempt to narrow down the Mis12C-binding region to a smaller region and perform the measurements with synthetic phospho-peptides as they did with Ndc80C. If CENP-T binds Mis12C with much weaker affinity than CENP-C, Mis12C will prefer to bind to CENP-C at the kinetochore, making it the major receptor for Mis12C."

The authors used recombinant proteins to demonstrate that CENP-T will bind to Ndc80 and to Mis12-Ndc80 after phosphorylation in vitro using Cyclin B-Cdk1. They identify the phosphorylation sites and show which sites are responsible for binding Ndc80 and Mis12. They use a combination of biochemical and electron microscopy assays to estimate the stoichiometry of the complexes generated and present evidence that CENP-T can bind directly to two molecules of Ndc80 via phospho-threonines 11 and 85, and to one molecule of Mis12 via phospho-serine 201. CENP-C can compete for Mis12 binding to this latter site. Many of the main conclusions have been reported recently in other work. For example, two papers from the Westermann lab (PMIDs: 27524485 and 23334295) and a paper from the Fukagawa lab (PMID: 23334297) previously identified the N-terminal Ndc80 binding peptides in CENP-T and its budding yeast equivalent. Thus, the data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> is not new. The clear demonstration of the stoichiometry of binding of two Ndc80 molecules to CENP-T in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a> is nice, but as these two binding peptides are in distinct regions of the molecule and are each sufficient for Ndc80 binding, this is not a particular surprise.

In the revised manuscript the authors cite the study by Nori Sagata (Suzuki et al., 2015) that showed phosphorylation at a non-SP consensus motif, to which S201 conforms. The problem with this is that the Suzuki et al. study also used baculovirus-expressed Cyclin B-Cdk1, thus the original problem remains unaddressed. As this is a key point of the manuscript the authors do need to show phosphorylation of S201 by bacterially-produced Cyclin B1-Cdk1.</i> "

In particular S201 is followed by a valine and from the crystal structures of Cdk1 and Cdk2 it is difficult to envisage how this would bind since their active sites have a bulky residue that in almost all substrates requires a proline to for the peptide chain to fit. From the materials and methods it appears that the authors used insect cell produced cyclin B-Cdk1 raising the possibility that S201 was phosphorylated by a contaminating kinase. It will be important to eliminate this possibility before publication.\u201d"

We also referred to previous work showing that replacement of Pro with Val is the least damaging substitution for the +1 position of the substrate."

The preference for Pro is determined by a very unusual main chain angle of the activation segment, typical of a left-handed helix. This peculiar conformation forces a main chain carbonyl of the activation segment to point away from the position that would allow it to establish a hydrogen bond with the main chain of the substrate, and specifically between the target S/T and the +1 residue. Pro is insensitive to this penalty, because it does not have a main chain amide, and becomes therefore selected through a \u201cnegative mechanism\u201d. The implication is that phosphorylation of other sequences is energetically more costly, and not that it cannot take place due to steric hindrance, as implied by the reviewers. It follows that adequate energetic compensation with surrounding sequences might render other substrates more appealing."

The editorial office contacted me to let me know that revisions require that individual text and figure files are uploaded and I inadvertently forgot to include this control. I apologize for that.

There are several key points in our manuscript, and certainly key in this context is that Ser201 mediates the interaction of CENP-T with the Mis12 complex when phosphorylated, which we prove beyond reasonable doubt. Key would also be to show that this site is a target of CDK1:Cyclin B in cells. We show that the interaction is suppressed before mitosis, arguing that a mitotic kinase does the job. Inhibiting CDK1 in vivo would not take us very far. So this truly important question will remain unanswered until some proper and complex in vivo sensor can be developed. To summarize, we see the question raised by the reviewers as rather marginal in the context of this manuscript."

During the first review, only a generic statement that the issue is given proper attention was raised. As I explained above, we tried to answer this concern by showing that there is substantial prior art. The reviewers did not find our answer sufficient and have now raised a specific suggestion. This may not be an <i>eLife</i> style request, in my opinion, unless the deficiency it addressed was at risk of invalidating the paper\u2019s main conclusions or interpretation, which is clearly not the case here. We also note that we do not have this reagent in our laboratory. We are aware of a previously generated expression system \u2013 by Tim Hunt\u2019s laboratory \u2013 that made use of the frog kinase (we use human reagents throughout). The paper is already gigantic and it reports a very large body of high quality work, none of which requires, for its interpretation, that the kinase is known with absolute accuracy."

Mass spectrometry analysis of this sample failed to detect any S/T kinases (we have this result in a non-annotated list that I will be very happy to share if you wanted to see it, but this will require annotation, as we had to search a self-compiled insect cell database). All contaminants, with the exception of Hsp70, were detected in trace amounts (a single peptide). We also included the experiment with RO-3306 that I had forgotten to include in the revision (panel B). And finally, we also include a new experiment in which we demonstrate that RO-3306 inhibits the CDK1:Cyclin B mediated interaction of CENP-T with the MIS12 complex (panel C). Furthermore, we have modified the text to state that we cannot exclude the possibility that CENP-T is phosphorylated by a contaminating kinase, but that the evidence we provide makes this possibility rather slim (this statement introduces the description of this new <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."
