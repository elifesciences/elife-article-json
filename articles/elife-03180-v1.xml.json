Despite this critical role, it is not known whether CD28 has functions in maintaining T cell responses following activation.  To determine the role for CD28 after T cell priming we generated a strain of mice where CD28 is removed from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after priming. We show that continued CD28 expression is important for effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following infection; maintained CD28 is required for the expansion of T helper type 1 cells, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper cells during viral infection. Persistent CD28 is also required for clearance of the bacterium <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> from the gastrointestinal tract.  Together, this study demonstrates that CD28 persistence is required for helper T cell polarization in response to infection, describing a novel function for CD28 that is distinct from its role in T cell priming."
