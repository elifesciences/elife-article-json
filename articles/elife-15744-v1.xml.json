                    "text": "Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels regulate excitability in many neurons. As is the case for all voltage-gated channels, it is widely assumed that individual Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels behave independently with respect to voltage-activation, open probability, and facilitation. Here, we report the results of super-resolution imaging, optogenetic, and electrophysiological measurements that refute this long-held view. We found that the short channel isoform (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>), but not the long (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>), associates in functional clusters of two or more channels that open cooperatively, facilitating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels are coupled via a C-terminus-to-C-terminus interaction that requires binding of the incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> to calmodulin (CaM) and subsequent binding of CaM to the pre-IQ domain of the channels. Physically-coupled channels facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents as a consequence of their higher open probabilities, leading to increased firing rates in rat hippocampal neurons. We propose that cooperative gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels represents a mechanism for the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and electrical activity."

As is the case for all voltage-gated channels, it is widely assumed that individual Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels behave independently with respect to voltage-activation, open probability, and facilitation. Here, we report the results of super-resolution imaging, optogenetic, and electrophysiological measurements that refute this long-held view. We found that the short channel isoform (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>), but not the long (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub>), associates in functional clusters of two or more channels that open cooperatively, facilitating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels are coupled via a C-terminus-to-C-terminus interaction that requires binding of the incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> to calmodulin (CaM) and subsequent binding of CaM to the pre-IQ domain of the channels. Physically-coupled channels facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents as a consequence of their higher open probabilities, leading to increased firing rates in rat hippocampal neurons. We propose that cooperative gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels represents a mechanism for the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and electrical activity."

Further experiments showed that coupling the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 channels together allows them to cooperate, and makes them more likely to be open and generate bigger calcium flows, and allowed neurons to send electrical signals more frequently. Future challenges include investigating how the clusters of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 channels are established and maintained, and determining how the channels\u2019 cooperation plays a role in both healthy and diseased states."

The opening of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels causes a local increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> that induces two opposing regulatory mechanisms: Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation (CDF) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ben-Johny and Yue, 2014</a>). CDF manifests as an increase in the magnitude of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 current (<i>I<sub>Ca</sub></i>) with repetitive activation. In neurons, CDF can induce a persistent <i>I<sub>Ca</sub></i> that increases firing rate and may even lead to self-sustained firing (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fransen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Major and Tank, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sheffield et al., 2013</a>).

Because Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> lacks that PDZ domain, CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation is unlikely to be responsible for CDF in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels.

We performed a quantitative analysis of <i>NP</i><sub>o</sub>. The whole-cell current (I) is given by the equation I = <i>i*N*P</i><sub>o</sub>, where <i>i</i> is the amplitude of the elementary current, <i>N</i> is the number of functional channels, and <i>P</i><sub>o</sub> is the channel open probability. Since elementary Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> currents are larger when Ba<sup>2+</sup> rather than Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the charge carrier, for I<sub>Ca</sub> to be similar to I<sub>Ba</sub>, the <i>NP</i><sub>o</sub> of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> must be higher in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> than Ba<sup>2+</sup>. We estimated <i>NP</i><sub>o</sub> with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup> as charge carriers by dividing the amplitude of whole-cell Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> currents at -10 mV, by the values of unitary current. Our analysis relies on the assumption that the relatively larger peak of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> currents in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was not due to faster activation kinetic of this channel than that of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels. This assumption is reasonable, as we found no significant difference in the activation time constants for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> currents that were 1.60 \u00b1 0.22 and 1.17 \u00b1 0.051 ms (-10 mV, n = 6 for each channel, p = 0.112), respectively.

Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> sparklets were recorded at a membrane potential of -80 mV in the presence of 20\u2009mM external Ca<sup>2+</sup>; 10\u2009mM EGTA was included in the patch pipette to confine the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signal to within ~1 \u00b5m of the point of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zenisek et al., 2003</a>). A quantal analysis of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> sparklets revealed the presence of single-level (elementary) events with a mean amplitude of ~40 nM for both channels, in agreement with our previous study (<a href=\"#bib35\">Navedo et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, consistent with our single channel data, we found that multi-quantal sparklets, which presumably result from the simultaneous opening of several Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, were more commonly observed in cells expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> than Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To determine whether channels in a cluster opened cooperatively or independently, we calculated the coupling coefficient (\u03ba) among channels within a Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> sparklet site by applying a coupled Markov-chain model (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chung and Kennedy, 1996</a>).

To test this hypothesis, we examined the spatial organization of endogenous Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in hippocampal neurons using super-resolution localization microscopy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>). Hippocampal neurons were immunostained against Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 using an antibody kindly provided by Dr. William Catterall and Dr. Ruth Westenbroek. This analysis showed that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels form clusters occupying an average area of 3660 \u00b1 80 nm<sup>2</sup> (n = 5). The antibody used in this study has been shown to not recognize the corresponding sequence of the closely related Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 \u03b1 subunit in both, transfected cells and hippocampal tissue (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hell et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">2013</a>).

The rationale for using only Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-GFP channels in these studies is twofold. <i>First</i>, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> and not Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channels have the ability to undergo coupled activation. <i>Second</i>, the size of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> puncta (at least in tsA-201 cells) is similar. Thus, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> clusters are likely composed of the same number of channels. We identified and excited single Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel clusters in hippocampal neurons and tsA-201 cells using TIRF microscopy with a penetration depth of 130 nm. Although some intracellular signal could be collected, the use of TIRF restricts the signal mainly to the plasmalemmal fraction of the channels. After continuous photobleaching we counted the number of step-wise decreases in fluorescence intensity of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-GFP clusters. The majority (65%) of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> clusters underwent at least five stepwise decreases in fluorescence, with the remaining clusters showing fewer steps. A single photobleaching step was observed in only 4% of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> clusters. The mean number of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels per cluster determined through sequential photobleaching was 8 \u00b1 1 (n = 1105 clusters, 18 cells) in hippocampal neurons, this number is consistent with the average cluster area calculated from our super-resolution data and is similar to that reported in two different studies on the L-type channel distribution in hippocampal neurons using immunogold-labeling with electron microscopy and high-resolution immunofluorescence techniques (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leitch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Obermair et al., 2004</a>). Step-photobleaching in tsA-201 cells revealed an average of 5 \u00b1 1 Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels per cluster (n = 585 clusters, 11 cells), consistent also with our super-resolution cluster area measurements (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Cells in the first group (controls) were dialyzed with a standard Cs<sup>+</sup>-based intracellular solution. Cells in the second group were dialyzed with a CaM-inhibitory peptide corresponding to a 15-aa fragment of the wild-type CaM-binding domain of myosin light chain kinase (MLCKp; 1\u2009\u03bcM), which binds to CaM with high affinity (apparent dissociation constant, ~6 pM) in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Torok and Trentham, 1994</a>) and has been used by others as a competitive inhibitor of CaM (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ciampa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mercado et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Piper and Large, 2004</a>). The third group consisted of cells co-expressing a dominant-negative mutant form of CaM (CaM<sub>1234</sub>) that does not bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> through its N- or C-terminal lobes. Dialysis of MLCKp or co-expression of CaM<sub>1234</sub> prevented Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VN and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VC fusion upon membrane depolarization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a>). Although MLCKp and CaM<sub>1234</sub> were equally effective in preventing Venus reconstitution, they had differential effects on I<sub>Ca</sub> inactivation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Whereas the fraction of peak <i>I<sub>Ca</sub>\u00a0</i>remaining at 300 ms (r<sub>300</sub>) in MLCKp-dialyzed cells (0.11 \u00b1 0.03, n = 5) was similar to that of controls (0.14 \u00b1 0.03, n = 5), the rate of inactivation of <i>I<sub>Ca</sub></i> was slower in cells expressing CaM<sub>1234</sub>, as reflected in a much higher r<sub>300</sub> value (0.75 \u00b1 0.05, n = 5) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Our interpretation of these findings is that the CaM molecules involved in CDI are distinct from those involved in functional coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels. The results suggest that CaM molecules that mediate coupling could be both attached to the channels or recruited to the C-terminus during depolarization. This could explain why they are accessible to MLCKp blockade, unlike the CaM molecules that mediate CDI, which are tethered to the IQ domain of the channels (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pitt et al., 2001</a>)."

These sites have different affinities for CaM; whereas CaM is \u201cpre-associated\u201d and binds tightly to the IQ domain, the association of CaM with the pre-IQ domain is seemingly weaker and likely transient. To determine which of these sites is necessary for CaM-mediated Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> coupling, we generated two mutants of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VN and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>-VC channels.

We began by recording spontaneous Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 sparklets from these cells. As in tsA-201 cells expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets in neurons were restricted to specific sites and had multi-quantal amplitudes resulting from the simultaneous opening and closing of multiple channels. The quantal unit of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was about 40 nM. The coupling coefficient (\u03ba) of sparklet sites ranged from 0.14 to 0.33. The average \u03ba value was 0.23 \u00b1 0.04 (n = 6). Importantly, sparklet site activity was decreased by application of 300 nM of the dihydropyridine antagonist isradipine and completely eliminated when the concentration of the drug was increased to 10 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A and B</a>). This is consistent with the hypothesis that sparklets in hippocampal neurons were produced by L-type calcium channels. Both Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3\u00a0channels are expressed in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hell et al., 1993</a>) and although it is impossible to distinguish between these two L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0channels using either electrophysiological or pharmacological methods, it has been shown that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels have a reduced sensitivity to dihydropyridines compared to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lipscombe et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Xu and Lipscombe, 2001</a>). A previous study by Koschak et al found that 100% of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels but only ~60% of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are inhibited by 300 nM isradipine (<a href=\"#bib24\">Koschak et al., 2001</a>), given this, it is reasonable to assume that any sparklet remaining after application of 300 nM isradipine is more likely to be generated by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3channels than Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2. In addition, near by 25% of the L-type current in hippocampal neurons is carried by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels (<a href=\"#bib31\">Moosmang et al., 2005</a>), this proportion is in agreement with the remaining sparklet site density we observed after the treatment with 300 nM isradipine (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>)."

For example, in SA node cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels is a key feature in the generation of pacemaker activity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mangoni et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Platzer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Striessnig et al., 2014</a>). In addition, it has been shown in a recent paper that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels play a critical role in controlling pacemaker activity in SAN cells through the activation of RyR and the triggering of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Torrente et al., 2016</a>). The present results suggest a potential new mechanism for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent control of pacing in these cells. Accordingly, spontaneous junctional SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events could induce multimerization of nearby Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub>, which, once fused, could produce persistent inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents that increase the number of RyR activated, thereby driving SA node cells closer to the threshold for action potential generation."

Borosilicate patch pipettes with resistances of 3\u20136 M\u03a9 were filled with an internal solution containing 87\u2009mM cesium aspartate (CsAsp), 20\u2009mM CsCl, 1\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 10\u2009mM EGTA and 5\u2009mM MgATP, adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. A voltage offset of 10 mV, attributable to the liquid junction potential of these solutions, was corrected offline. Current\u2013voltage relationships were obtained by subjecting cells to a series of 300-ms depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of -80 mV to test potentials ranging from -70 to +50 mV. The voltage dependence of channel activation (G/G<sub>max</sub>) was obtained from the resultant currents by converting them to conductances using the equation, G = <i>I<sub>Ca</sub></i>/(test pulse potential \u2013 reversal potential of <i>I<sub>Ca</sub></i>); normalized G/G<sub>max</sub> was plotted as a function of test potential.

Briefly, TIRF images of tsA-201 or hippocampal neurons expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels fused to the monomeric GFP were acquired using our Leica GSD microscope in TIRF mode. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\u2009min prior to the acquisition. Images were acquired using an oil immersion 160x objective (NA 1.43) and an Andor iXON EMCCD camera. GFP was excited with a 488 nm laser and image stacks of 2000 frames were acquired at 30\u2009Hz. During analysis, the first 5 images of the stack were averaged and a rolling-ball background subtraction was applied using ImageJ (NIH). This image was then low-pass filtered with a 2 pixel cut-off and high-pass filtered with a 5 pixel cut-off. Thresholding was then applied to identify connected regions of pixels that were above threshold. The ImageJ plugin \u2018Time Series Analyzer v2.0\u2019 was used to select 4x4 pixel ROIs, centered on the peak pixel in each spot. These ROIs were used to plot Z-axis intensity profiles (where z is time) of the entire image stack to manually detect the bleaching steps."

In this approach, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels were fused to either the VN fragments (N<sub>1\u2013154</sub>) or the VC fragment (C<sub>155\u2013238</sub>) of the Venus fluorescent protein. The Venus protein emits fluorescence only when the two fragments are close enough to interact and reconstitute the whole protein, providing a measure of the proximity between the C-terminus of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> -VN and/or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> -VC constructs were expressed at a 1:1 ratio in hippocampal neurons; tRFP fluorescence was used as an indicator of successful transfection. Confocal images were acquired with a Fluoview FV1000 microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) equipped with a UPlanS-Apochromat 60\u00d7 (NA 1.2) water-immersion objective. The Venus protein was excited using a 488 nm laser line. The calcium dependence of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 spontaneous interactions was studied in tsA-201 cells expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> -VC alone or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> -VN and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> -VC in a 1:1 ratio. Using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, cells were depolarized from a holding voltage of -80 mV to test potentials ranging from -60 to +60 mV, administered as 9-s pulses. Maturation of newly reconstituted Venus protein takes some time, hence the long depolarizing pulse (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nagai et al., 2002</a>). Images were acquired at a frequency of 100\u2009Hz during each depolarizing pulse using a through-the-lens TIRF microscope built around an inverted microscope (IX-70; Olympus) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat (60\u00d7; NA 1.49) oil-immersion lens (Olympus) and an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (iXON; Andor Technology, UK). The last 10 images of each stack were averaged, and total fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ software (NIH). The images were pseudo-colored using the \u2018red hot\u2019 lookup table in ImageJ. F<sub>0</sub> was calculated by dividing the total fluorescence for each voltage by the initial fluorescence at -80 mV. The change in F/F<sub>0</sub> was plotted against voltage and compared to G/G<sub>max</sub> curves constructed as described in the electrophysiology section. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of Venus reconstitution was tested in cells bathed in an external solution containing 20\u2009mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> or 2\u2009mM Ba<sup>2+</sup>."

This is consistent with our model, as the extent of Venus reconstitution depends on the local calcium concentration produced by the coordinated opening of clustered channels and less on magnitude of the flux through individual channels. The second factor contributing to the shared voltage dependencies is the irreversible nature of the Venus reconstitution, resulting in an increased number of fluorescent proteins with each successive depolarization as the open probability of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels increases.\""

Ultimately, this is attributed the distal C-terminus competing away CaM binding to the channel. However, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> used in the paper demonstrates quite a robust CDI (e.g. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A, B</a>), indicating that CaM is bound to the channel. The comparable CDI between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3s and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> observed in the paper is likely due to the use of the rat clones which are known to display similar CDI at ambient CaM concentrations (Yang et al., 2006, J. Neurosci. 26:10677-89). This is because the rat Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> has a point mutation relative to the human clone, which weakens its affinity for the CaM-binding domain such that ambient CaM is sufficient to (by competition) access its site on the channel (Liu et al., 2010, Nature, 463:968-973). Given this, it is unclear why Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> would lack the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation described here. At the very least the interpretation that this due to CaM being excluded from these channels is not supported?"

Since this domain competitively tunes the interaction of calmodulin with its upstream binding sites (pre-IQ, IQ) the long mutant Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel behaves functionally more like short splice variants (that lack ICDI due to splicing), with higher CDI and higher open probability, properties that are crucial for the interpretation of the author's data.

We propose that this is a consequence of two factors. First, Venus fluorescence (i.e., reconstitution) and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> conductance have similar sigmoidal relationships suggesting that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> coupling is primarily determined by the open probability of these channels. This is consistent with our model, as the extent of Venus reconstitution depends on the local calcium concentration produced by the coordinated opening of clustered channels and less on magnitude of the flux through individual channels. The second factor contributing to the shared voltage dependencies is the irreversible nature of the Venus reconstitution, resulting in an increased number of fluorescent proteins with each successive depolarization as the open probability of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channels increases.\" These lines should be removed as they represent an over-interpretation of the data. As the authors note in their second point, the sigmoidal nature of the Venus reconstitution dependence on voltage most likely reflects the irreversible nature of the Venus reconstitution such that fluorescence accumulates with successive depolarizations. I suspect if the experiments were done in reverse (i.e., test pulses stepping down from +60 mV to -60 mV) that the relationship would also show a sigmoidal relationship but with the fluorescence lower at the higher voltages where channel Po is higher. This thought experiment suggests the idea that \"\u2026Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> coupling is primarily determined by the open probability of these channels\u2026\" is an oversimplification.</i> We agree that the sigmoidal nature of the Venus reconstitution dependence on voltage is likely to be a consequence of the irreversibility of Venus reconstitution as we have stated. Accordingly, we removed the discussion of the relationship between physical Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>S</sub> channel coupling and the <i>P<sub>o</sub></i> of clustered channels.

Neurosci. 26:10677-89). This is because the rat Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> has a point mutation relative to the human clone, which weakens its affinity for the CaM-binding domain such that ambient CaM is sufficient to (by competition) access its site on the channel (Liu et al., 2010, Nature, 463:968-973). Given this, it is unclear why Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> would lack the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation described here. At the very least the interpretation that this due to CaM being excluded from these channels is not supported?</i> We thank Reviewers 1 and 2 for noting that using the mutated Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> could confound the central conclusion of our study. As requested, we repeated all our experiments using the corrected version of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> channel to be completely sure that the lack of coupling of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L</sub> was not an effect of the mutations contained in the construct. Virtually all the results were identical to what we have seen with the previous construct containing the substitution of V by A in position 2075 (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>L(V2075A)</sub>) and they are summarized below:"
