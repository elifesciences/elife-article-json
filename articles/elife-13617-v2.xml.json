However, the dynamic molecular processes involved make it difficult to correlate clustering with functional consequences in vivo. We developed a live-cell super-resolution approach to uncover the correlation between mRNA synthesis and the dynamics of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) clusters at a gene locus. For endogenous \u03b2-actin genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we observe that short-lived (~8 s) Pol II clusters correlate with basal mRNA output. During serum stimulation, a stereotyped increase in Pol II cluster lifetime correlates with a proportionate increase in the number of mRNAs synthesized. Our findings suggest that transient clustering of Pol II may constitute a pre-transcriptional regulatory event that predictably modulates nascent mRNA output."

However, the dynamic molecular processes involved make it difficult to correlate clustering with functional consequences in vivo. We developed a live-cell super-resolution approach to uncover the correlation between mRNA synthesis and the dynamics of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) clusters at a gene locus. For endogenous \u03b2-actin genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we observe that short-lived (~8 s) Pol II clusters correlate with basal mRNA output. During serum stimulation, a stereotyped increase in Pol II cluster lifetime correlates with a proportionate increase in the number of mRNAs synthesized. Our findings suggest that transient clustering of Pol II may constitute a pre-transcriptional regulatory event that predictably modulates nascent mRNA output."

Our data reveal a previously uncharacterized, direct correlation between Pol II cluster lifetime and the number of nascent mRNA molecules subsequently synthesized. We find that this correlation between Pol II cluster lifetime and nascent mRNA output is predictive in nature, and may be utilized by an experimenter to stall or induce a burst of transcription, at will using a drug treatment.

The observation of a molecule in a single frame is registered as a count of one \u201cdetection\u201d. The camera continuously records for typically 10,000 frames. The photo-converted Dendra2 molecules typically remain in the emitting state for tens to hundreds of milliseconds, and therefore a single molecule may appear in multiple frames and hence may be detected more than once. The fluorescent molecule then typically undergoes an irreversible transition into a permanent, dark state (photo-bleaching). However, the molecule may also transition to a transient dark state (blinking) before photo-bleaching.

The number of converted molecules at any given time can be controlled by the power density of 405\u00a0nm illumination. Ideally, sufficiently low 405\u00a0nm illumination is applied such that at most one molecule is detected per frame in a given region of interest. This sparse activation is a necessary condition for precise localization in single-molecule based super-resolution techniques. Consequently, at any given time, super-resolution techniques detect only a small subset of all fluorescent molecules present; and over a period of time, it is the frequency of detections that represents the relative local protein concentration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Regions of high local protein concentration will have a higher frequency of detections compared to regions of low protein concentration. This is the principle behind the time-correlated detection counting method we developed to reveal the dynamics of protein clusters existing below the diffraction (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cisse et al., 2013</a>)."

We interpret as <i>de novo</i> cluster assembly, events in which the onset of slope increase occurs after the acquisition has started (i.e. after time t = 0). Steep slopes are followed by an abrupt plateau, due to a sudden decrease in detection frequency with virtually no Pol II detection events. We interpret the inflection points with sudden transitions from very high to very low frequency of detections as cluster disassembly events.

The initial linear increase is followed by a more gradual transition to a plateau, reflecting the gradual depletion of the pool of unconverted Dendra2-Pol II through continued photo-conversion. To further verify that the distinct temporal signatures between fixed and live cell data did not stem from the fixation procedure, we decided to image a stable protein cluster in live cells. We generated a fusion of the histone H2B, well known to remain stably bound within the short timescales of our experiments (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Izeddin et al., 2014</a>) labeled with our photo-convertible protein tag (H2B-Dendra2).

This confirms that time-correlated super-resolution analysis is readily able to discriminate between stable and transient protein assemblies.

Upon transcription, the inserted MS2 sequence forms a hairpin structure in the untranslated region of the mRNA. This hairpin is specifically recognized by the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 (MS2 Coat Protein, MCP), which is exogenous to mammals (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bertrand et al., 1998</a>). When the MEF cells stably express MCP fused to the self-labeling HaloTag, the MCP-HaloTag molecules specifically decorate and accumulate on the tandem hairpin structure contained in the \u03b2-actin mRNA. The accumulation of MCP-HaloTag on the mRNA enables imaging of individual \u03b2-actin mRNA molecules (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lionnet et al., 2011a</a>). To visualize the MCP-HaloTag proteins, we use a far-red organic dye, Janelia Fluor 646 (JF<sub>646</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Grimm et al., 2015</a>) conjugated to a HaloTag ligand.

It makes the assumption that during a clustering event multiple Pol II can be loaded onto the gene, and the loaded Pol II molecules transcribe nascent mRNAs at a constant elongation rate. The elongation rate of Pol II is left as a free parameter such that the theoretical model can be fitted to the experimental data.

CDK9 the kinase of the positive transcriptional elongation factor (P-TEFb) must then phosphorylate Pol II to enable promoter escape, and entry into productive elongation. DRB (as well as flavopiridol) prevents the ATP-binding in CDK9, and thereby maintains initiating Pol II in the promoter-proximal paused state (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bensaude, 2011</a>). Indeed, we observed that DRB induces stable Pol II clusters analogous to those observed after flavopiridol treatment (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). While the effect of flavopiridol is irreversible, DRB treatment is reversible, thus enabling revocable control of the drug effect.

Indeed, beyond components of the Pol II machinery, we speculate that clustering might constitute a general mechanism to build high concentration of factors at discrete genomic loci. For instance, it was recently observed that the nuclear distribution of the pluripotency regulator, Sox2, is highly heterogeneous forming dozens of spatial clusters in the nucleus of embryonic stem cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">Liu et al., 2014</a>), and in another study spatial clusters of CDK9 were observed (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ghamari et al., 2013</a>). Our findings on Pol II and mRNA output suggest such a local enrichment of transcription factors can result in a more efficient transcription process in vivo. Because DNA super-coiling has been suggested to play a role in gene bursting in bacteria (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chong et al., 2014</a>), it is an intriguing possibility that topological constraint on the DNA may also play a role in cluster-dependent transcriptional regulation."

Promoter proximal pausing has also been observed in a wide range of genes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kim et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Muse et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</a>). Our results hint at possible mechanistic relationships between Pol II cluster disassembly and the release of paused polymerase. Although most of beta-actin regulation is thought to be regulated by promoter-proximal sequences (<a href=\"#bib17\">Danilition et al., 1991</a>), another important question is whether distal enhancer elements could regulate the initiation and/or lifetime of Pol II clustering by looping to contact the promoter of their target genes. Future studies bridging quantitative single cell imaging of Pol II recruitment with genome-wide mapping of Pol II occupancy and long-distance regulatory interactions will provide important insights in the relationships between chromatin architecture, docking, pausing/release, and Pol II clustering."

Clusters were simulated as 100 Pol II molecules assembling and disassembling at times set by the user (e.g. we modeled dynamic clusters as 100 molecules assembling at 200s and disassembling at 210\u00a0s; static clusters were modeled as clusters assembling at 200\u00a0s without disassembly). While the cluster was present, each of the 100 molecules trajectories was independently modeled using the Gillespie algorithm, with the molecular states consistent with our photophysical model (Appendix 4\u20135, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The molecules were allowed to turn on (<i>k<sub>on</sub></i> = 0.0067\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>); once on, they could either blink to a dark state (<i>k<sub>dark</sub></i> = 9.6\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>) or photobleach (<i>k<sub>bleach</sub></i> = 3\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>). Blinking molecules could turn back to the on state with a rate <i>k<sub>rev</sub></i> = 2.33\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>. All transition rates were set to our experimentally measured values. Once the time of all molecular transitions was determined, trajectories were binned with a 60 ms step to mimic camera acquisition. Simultaneous detections of two or more molecules were only counted as a single count to reflect our data analysis which does not take the spot intensity into account. Blinking events shorter than half a frame were left undetected to model our limited camera sensitivity."

For each region, the likelihood of a given trajectory was calculated for varying guesses of the number of molecules, and the number which maximized the likelihood of the trajectory was called the estimate for the number of observed molecules. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, the ROIs can be roughly partitioned into two groups on the basis of the cumulative number of localizations. These two groups are tentatively identified as \u2018Clustered\u2019 and \u2018Un-clustered\u2019. We were able to obtain estimates for the number of molecules inside of the \u2018Un-clustered\u2019 ROIs.

Subsequently, the continuous time simulation was binned according to the kinetic cycle time of 60 ms.

Note that multiple molecules in the on state at the same time can only lead to a single detection. The cumulant of all detections in a cluster was calculated for comparison with experimental data.

Because the empirical activation rate (~1/150 s<sup>-1</sup>; data not shown) is two orders of magnitude slower than the three previously determined rate constants, we expect that k<sub>on</sub> dominates the empirical activation rate. Indeed, simulations using our estimated transition rates reveal that the fit time constant of the cumulant is equivalent to the activation time constant, k<sub>on</sub>, of the simulation within 2.6% (Data not shown). We therefore identify the empirical rate constant as k<sub>on</sub>, and can easily estimate it in live cells for each individual cell, and fixed cell experiments are unnecessary for its determination."

This is indeed the case in the regime of low Pol II counts (up to ~20 Pol II molecules at a given allele, Pearson\u2019s coefficient=0.63), demonstrating that small number of Pol II molecules indeed correspond to elongating polymerases.

These simulations illustrate very clearly that 1) if the clusters were long-lived, we would observe a sustained increase in the cumulated detections over time (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), because in our regime, only a small fraction of Pol II molecules (a few percent) can be activated and photobleached in the ~10s of a cluster lifetime. 2) The onset of the plateau after each cluster gives a faithful estimate of the disassembly of the cluster (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>); 3) if clusters were pre-formed prior to our experiment, we would detect them immediately. We therefore conclude that albeit relying on stochastic activations, our technique provides an accurate measurement of the start- and end-points of the clusters. The nature of the biological event driving cluster disassembly remains to be explored (for instance a polymerase escaping a paused state might very well provide the disassembly signal, see summary below and discussion of the revised manuscript), but our technique can faithfully determine when disassembly happens: if many Pol II molecules remained at the locus for longer than a few seconds, our traces would not end as abruptly as they do."

Let us imagine a locus where a single Pol II pauses without disassembly of the cluster: since our activation power is low, we would detect a persisting slope in the tcPALM cumulant time trace, corresponding to the molecules in the cluster gradually turning on one by one (it would take minutes to entirely photoconvert a typical cluster of ~100 molecules). After minutes, the cumulant time trace would slowly saturate, as most Pol II molecules in the cluster have been photoconverted. This is indeed the case in the DRB and Flavopiridol live cell data where pausing escape is inhibited yet a slope still persists (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>, and time traces in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D and E</a>), and illustrated in our simulations of a long-lived cluster (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."

As a consequence, if proteins were to gradually accumulate at the locus, the cumulant time trace slope would not be constant but increase over time. This is because we typically photoconvert much slower than proteins accumulate."

As such, in fixed cells data, we observe a constant slope in the cumulant time trace from the beginning of the acquisition, up to the point when most molecules have been photoconverted and the curve gradually transitions into a plateau. In fixed cells this gradual slope decrease is interpretable as the gradual depletion of the pool of photoconvertible proteins in the cluster. In live cells, by contrast, slope onset is sparse and occurs abruptly, suggesting de-novo, rapid cluster assembly, and the plateaus are also sudden, suggesting disassembly is rapid as well. The exception is in the drug-treated living cells where clusters cumulant timetraces become comparable to the fixed cells controls, suggesting that tcPALM is capable of resolving static clusters if they occur in live cells."

This is exemplified in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> in which we simulate what we would observe if we performed our experiment on a static cluster. As Pol II molecules gradually disappear (fraction of green shrinks in top left panel), the slope of the cumulant time trace slowly decreases (slope of example clusters in bottom left panels). In living cells, because clusters are short lived, we usually only convert a small fraction of the molecules within the few seconds of a clustering event (e.g. ~10 molecules out of a 100 molecules cluster within 10s <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Therefore, the lifetime we measure (the duration of the positive slope events in bottom right panel of <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) reflects the duration of the biological assembly of multiple Pol II molecules. If a cluster had a longer lifetime (but the same total number of proteins), we would expect to detect molecules for a longer interval. As a result, the total amplitude of the step in the cumulant trace would be proportionally larger. However, the slope of the cumulant timetrace during the cluster would be identical. This is what we observe in our simulations: compare the cumulant time trace slope in the case of the short (10s) cluster (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, bottom right panel) to that of a longer-lived cluster (first 20s of bottom right panel in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."
