How the activity of these motors is regulated during cargo sorting is poorly understood. In this study, we address this issue using a novel in vitro assay for the motility of localising <i>Drosophila</i> mRNAs bound to native dynein-dynactin complexes. High precision tracking reveals that individual RNPs within a population undergo either diffusive, or highly processive, minus end-directed movements along microtubules. RNA localisation signals stimulate the processive movements, with regulation of dynein-dynactin\u2019s activity rather than its total copy number per RNP, responsible for this effect. Our data support a novel mechanism for multi-motor translocation based on the regulation of dynein processivity by discrete cargo-associated features. Studying the in vitro responses of RNPs to microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and microtubule ends provides insights into how an RNA population could navigate the cytoskeletal network and become anchored at its destination in cells."

Although previous experiments with artificial cargos suggested that the number of motors in the complex determines the likelihood of one-way traffic, it appears that one or more accessory proteins are actually in control during mRNA transport."

One set of studies has analysed motility of cargo populations within cells (e.g., <a href=\"#bib40\">Kural et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Shubeita et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Reis et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rai et al., 2013</a>). Although physiologically relevant, the mechanistic insights that can be derived from this approach are limited by the complex in vivo environment. The second set of studies have analysed the in vitro behaviours of artificial cargos, such as beads or DNA origami, coupled to isolated motor proteins or motor domains (e.g., <a href=\"#bib76\">Vale et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Block et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mallik et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Diehl et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ross et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Vershinin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Derr et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Furuta et al., 2013</a>). These in vitro studies have provided evidence that small increases in the number of purified motors of the same polarity strongly augment the average travel distance in that direction (<a href=\"#bib7\">Block et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mallik et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Vershinin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Derr et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Furuta et al., 2013</a>).

Cytoplasmic injection of in vitro synthesised fluorescent transcripts has shed light on the mechanisms governing RNA sorting in this system. These experiments have provided evidence that apical mRNA localisation is achieved by a bidirectional translocation process in which, on average, minus end-directed transport by the multi-subunit dynein motor and its large accessory complex dynactin predominates (<a href=\"#bib85\">Wilkie and Davis, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bullock et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Vendra et al., 2007</a>). Upon reaching the apical cytoplasm, the ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) are statically anchored by an unknown, dynein-dependent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib13\">Delanoue and Davis, 2005</a>). mRNAs that are uniformly distributed also move bidirectionally, but with little net directional bias (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bullock et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amrute-Nayak and Bullock, 2012</a>). Intriguingly, dynein-dynactin is required for both plus end- and minus end-directed motion of the localising and uniformly distributed RNPs formed upon injection (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bullock et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Vendra et al., 2007</a>)<b>.</b> Dynein is also needed for efficient spreading of uniformly distributed endogenous RNAs from the perinuclear region, supporting a physiological requirement for the motor complex in bidirectional RNA motion (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bullock et al., 2006</a>). These findings, together with the failure to detect functional evidence for the involvement of a kinesin motor (<a href=\"#bib78\">Vendra et al., 2007</a>), suggest that plus end movements of RNPs are driven by dynein moving in this direction, a property that has been documented in several in vitro studies of the motor (<a href=\"#bib63\">Schliwa et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wang et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wang and Sheetz, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mallik et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ross et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Miura et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Walter et al., 2012</a>)."

However, it is not known whether the dynein-dynactin recruited in this manner is more likely to engage in minus end-directed motion than that recruited elsewhere in the RNA.

We therefore developed RAT-TRAP (<span class=\"underline\">R</span>N<span class=\"underline\">A</span> <span class=\"underline\">T</span>ransport After <span class=\"underline\">T</span>ethered <span class=\"underline\">R</span>NA <span class=\"underline\">A</span>ffinity <span class=\"underline\">P</span>urification), a method to efficiently study RNP motility in an in vitro setting."

The RNAs were labelled by the stochastic incorporation of fluorophore-coupled UTP during the transcription reaction, permitting downstream visualisation by fluorescence microscopy. The assembled RNA-motor complexes were washed briefly and eluted from the beads with biotin, which competes for the interaction of the aptamer with streptavidin. This methodology leads to the recruitment of dynein-dynactin complexes to RNA localisation signals in association with Egl, BicD, and Lis1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dix et al., 2013</a>). To assay in vitro RNP motility, the eluate was supplemented with a saturating level of ATP and added to a chamber containing polarity-marked, GmpCpp-stabilised microtubules bound to a coverslip (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). RNAs and microtubules were then visualised with total internal reflection (TIR) microscopy."

Depletion of ATP and ADP with apyrase (<a href=\"#bib30\">Higuchi et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ma and Taylor, 1997</a>) led to a significant increase in the number of microtubule-associated RNPs compared to the ATP condition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). In the presence of apyrase there was also a large increase in the proportion of microtubule-bound RNPs that were stationary, with unidirectional behaviour absent and a strong reduction in the proportion of bidirectional complexes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). The affect of apyrase on unidirectional motion is entirely expected as processive movement of dynein is dependent on ATP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib57\">Roberts et al., 2013</a>). The inhibition of bidirectional motion by apyrase could conceivably be explained by dynein normally stepping towards both the minus and plus end of microtubules through ATP hydrolysis\u2014as has been documented in two previous studies of purified motor complexes (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ross et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Walter et al., 2012</a>)\u2014with frequent reversals between bouts of motion in each direction. Alternatively, RNPs could undergo passive diffusion along microtubules in the presence of ATP, with the presence of the motor on RNPs stimulating long-term arrest in the absence of ATP due to its tight microtubule binding in the no nucleotide state (<a href=\"#bib57\">Roberts et al., 2013</a>). Both these scenarios, or a combination of the two, could account for the relatively short mean run lengths, diffusive MSD properties, and the tight coupling of minus and plus end motile properties for individual bidirectional RNPs in the presence of ATP."

Similar distributions of lengths and velocities or individual runs in both the minus and plus end direction were also observed for bidirectional RNPs in both conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). Thus, even the occurrence of relatively long runs of <i>h</i><sup>WT</sup> RNPs was not prevented by vanadate (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). Vanadate actually caused a subtle but statistically significant increase in the mean run length and velocity of bidirectional RNPs in the minus and plus end directions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>), implying a modulation of the diffusive properties of RNPs when dynein is in the ADP.Pi state. Overall, our results demonstrate that an active energy transduction property of dynein is required for unidirectional, minus end-directed RNP motion but not for motion of bidirectional RNPs in either the minus or plus end direction. Thus, individual <i>h</i><sup><i>WT</i></sup> RNPs can adopt two discrete behaviours in vitro: unidirectional motion, driven by processive movement of dynein that is associated with ATP hydrolysis and bidirectional motion that appears to be dominated by passive diffusion."

Thus, localisation signals may promote unidirectional motion simply by increasing the average copy number of dynein-dynactin complexes bound per RNP. Such a model is consistent with previous work showing that individual purified dynein-dynactin complexes move bidirectionally in vitro, with additional dynein-dynactin complexes bound to a bead driving unidirectional motion in the minus end direction (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ross et al., 2006</a>).

Velocity of measured runs of bidirectional RNPs of the same species is lower at 4.2 fps than at 15 fps, presumably for the same reason, whereas velocity of unidirectional runs is not significantly affected by the different frame rate as short pauses have little affect on the velocity measured for such long runs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,I</a>). ***p&lt;0.001; **p&lt;0.01; *p&lt;0.05 (Mann Whitney non-parametric <i>t</i> test), compared to <i>h</i><sup>WT</sup> values for the same parameter; error bars represent SEM."

However, this was not the case. Approximately 65% of RNPs containing the <i>HLE</i> RNA exhibited unidirectional motion towards the minus end of microtubules, compared to 24% of those containing the <i>h</i><sup>WT</sup> RNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Consequently, the <i>HLE</i> RNP population had a particularly strong minus end directional bias (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These data indicate that total dynein-dynactin copy number is not the primary determinant of unidirectional RNP movement. Instead the <i>HLE</i> promotes the ability of the associated dynein-dynactin to undergo unidirectional transport, with features in the rest of the 3\u2032UTR seemingly antagonising this effect."

Because more pauses and reversals are missed at the lower frame rate, there are differences in the absolute values of measured lengths and velocities of runs for the <i>h</i><sup>WT</sup> RNPs compared to analysis at 15 fps, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> legends). The comparison of unidirectional runs of <i>HLE</i> and <i>h</i><sup>WT</sup> RNPs, together with the earlier evaluation of unidirectional motility of <i>h</i><sup>SL1x3</sup> and <i>h</i><sup>WT</sup> RNPs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>), demonstrates that once initiated the unidirectional mode of transport is not strongly influenced by the average number of cargo-associated dynein-dynactins.

Cargos moving along microtubules in vivo also have to contend with extrinsic factors, including MAPs that can act as obstacles. We were therefore interested in how RNPs assembled in the RAT-TRAP assay would react to the presence of MAPs and how this behaviour is influenced by manipulating dynein-dynactin copy number using the different <i>h</i> RNA variants. We decorated microtubules with two different recombinant, fluorescent MAPs and analysed the consequences on the motility of Cy3-labelled RNPs. The first MAP was a GFP-labelled <i>Drosophila</i> kinesin-1 with a rigor mutation (Kin<sub>401</sub>T99N:mGFP) that prevents its movement along the microtubule (<a href=\"#bib72\">Telley et al., 2009</a>). The second was a human Alexa488-labelled tau (isoform 23, also known as 0N3R) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dixit et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McVicker et al., 2011</a>), most of which undergoes diffusive movement on microtubules (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hinrichs et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). For both MAPs, stepwise photobleaching analysis of static, microtubule-associated puncta estimated an average of 4\u20135 monomers per diffraction-limited spot (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

The presence of tau23 on the microtubules also reduced the overall minus end bias to <i>h</i><sup>WT</sup> RNP motion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This effect of the MAPs was not associated with a significant reduction in the time that <i>h</i><sup>WT</sup> RNPs were detected in association with microtubules (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Thus, unlike the case for the wild-type kinesin-1 motor under similar conditions (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dixit et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Telley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McVicker et al., 2011</a>), <i>h</i><sup>WT</sup> RNPs did not frequently detach from microtubules bound by kin<sub>401</sub>T99N:mGFP or tau23.

The dispersed pattern of individual rigor kin<sub>401</sub>T99N:mGFP puncta on microtubules (see panel <b>A</b>) indicates that it is unlikely that multiple proteins per puncta are due to independent association of multiple dimers in a single diffraction-limited spot. Instead multiple kinesins may associate together in solution before microtubule binding. Note that we confirmed that purified kin<sub>401</sub>T99N:mGFP was predominantly dimeric before concentration using gel filtration. We also observed a maximum of two photobleaching steps of microtubule-associated kin<sub>401</sub>T99N:mGFP when a dilute solution of the protein (1 pM) was added to imaging chambers, consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib72\">Telley et al., 2009</a>).

These approaches are physiologically relevant but cannot rule out influences from the cellular environment, including possible indirect effects of altered motor concentration on other processes that impinge on cargo motility.

The most parsimonious explanation for the bidirectional motion is that it is also due to dynein undergoing back-and-forth movements along the microtubule, a behaviour that has been observed in several studies of the purified motor in vitro (e.g., <a href=\"#bib81\">Wang et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Wang and Sheetz, 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib83\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mallik et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ross et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Miura et al., 2010</a>) and also appears to occur in vivo (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ananthanarayanan et al., 2013</a>).

These data suggest that features associated with the RNA signal are sufficient to increase the probability of processive movement of the associated dynein. It has recently been shown in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> that microtubule-associated dynein can switch from diffusive to processive behaviour upon contacting cortical anchors, an event that regulates the generation of pulling forces on the microtubule (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ananthanarayanan et al., 2013</a>).

Thus, the regulatory mechanisms underpinning sorting of RNPs in this system appear distinct from those of other well-studied bidirectional cargos, which involve the interplay of opposite polarity force-generating motors, such as dyneins and kinesins (<a href=\"#bib67\">Shubeita et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ally et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Soppina et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jolly and Gelfand, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Reis et al., 2012</a>). How might localisation signals regulate dynein processivity? One possibility is that proteins recruited by the localisation signal directly regulate the activity of the motor. Two candidates to serve such a role are the adaptor proteins Egl and BicD, which are associated only with the dynein-dynactin bound to the localisation signals (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bullock et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dix et al., 2013</a>). It is also conceivable that the structure or rigidity of the RNA signal plays an architectural role in presenting dynein-dynactin to the microtubule in a manner that favours processive movement."

Non-processive dyneins are recruited to sites in the RNA other than localisation signals through an unknown factor (X). The most parsimonious explanation for the diffusive movement is that it is driven by dynein-dynactin. (Middle) The presence of a localisation signal leads to the recruitment of additional dynein-dynactin and a subset of RNPs in the population undergoing processive, minus end-directed transport. This introduces a minus end bias to motion of the RNA population. It is not the increased total copy number of the motor complex that drives unidirectional movement, but rather the ability of localisation signals to increase the probability of associated dynein-dynactin entering into a processive state. (Bottom) Addition of more SL1 elements increases further the likelihood of RNPs entering into the unidirectional state, leading to a greater minus end bias to motility of the RNA population. It is not known whether unidirectional motion involves stepping of a single dynein-dynactin or of multiple motor complexes. Resolving this issue will require long-term nanoscale analysis. Note that for simplicity the cartoon does not attempt to depict the absolute copy number of dynein-dynactin complexes on each RNP."

For example, reversals upon meeting an obstacle may facilitate encounters of RNPs with intersecting microtubules. Switching of RNPs between microtubules, a behaviour we have observed when intersections occur in our in vitro assays (unpublished observations), could allow these complexes to explore alternative routes to their destination. Reversals of RNPs at a MAP may also give dynein space to switch to a different lateral position on the same microtubule and thereby provide another opportunity to pass the obstacle following resumption of movement in the previous direction. Compatible with this notion, we see RNPs moving on single microtubules that can pass obstacles after multiple attempts (e.g., <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

The behaviour may also be advantageous in a cellular environment by preventing detachment of RNPs at this point, an outcome that would necessitate a rebinding event before motion on the microtubule network can resume. Interestingly, a subset of RNPs undergoes pausing at the minus ends of microtubules, with a mean dwell time of \u223c1 min for bidirectional complexes. These findings demonstrate that the probability of changing directions is different at the minus end and the plus end of the microtubule and that additional in vivo features, such as the \u03b3-tubulin ring complex or other centrosome-associated factors, are not obligatory for long-term retention of RNPs at the minus end. Intrinsic behaviours of RNPs upon reaching the minus end of the \u03b1/\u03b2-tubulin polymer may therefore contribute to the dynein-dependent anchorage of RNAs in the vicinity of minus ends in vivo (<a href=\"#bib13\">Delanoue and Davis, 2005</a>). Analysis of <i>h</i><sup>\u0394LE</sup>, <i>h</i><sup>WT</sup>, and <i>h</i><sup>SL1x3</sup> RNAs demonstrates that the probability of an RNP undergoing minus end pausing in vitro, as well as the duration of such events, is not influenced by the addition of more dynein-dynactins through localisation elements.

One explanation for these findings is that the ability of dynein bound to localisation signals to walk processively off the minus end is antagonised by interactions with the microtubule mediated by non-processive dynein bound at other sites in the RNA. Additional, long-term experiments will be required to test this hypothesis.

Diffusive motion along microtubules may be valuable for movement of RNPs through an obstacle rich environment and could still contribute to asymmetric sorting as it is associated with long-term retention of complexes at microtubule minus ends. This strategy appears analogous to that used by DNA enzymes and kinesins that depolymerise microtubules, which can employ one-dimensional diffusion to search for their specific target sites (<a href=\"#bib28\">Helenius et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gorman and Greene, 2008</a>)."

Our results also illustrate that intrinsic motile properties of cargo populations in vivo are likely to be obscured by the influence of extrinsic factors including MAPs and microtubule ends. Further exploitation of the RAT-TRAP assay is likely to be an effective strategy for shedding light on molecular mechanisms that underpin intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of cargo motility, particularly when combined with powerful <i>Drosophila</i> gene perturbation techniques. In the longer term, it will be important to understand how the behaviours defined in vitro are integrated during sorting of single RNA molecules in vivo, a goal that necessitates the development of new methods to visualise movement of transcripts in the optically challenging embryo system."

Magnetic beads were then incubated with 1 mg\u00b7ml<sup>\u22121</sup> BSA on ice for 60 min. This procedure was designed to block unspecific binding sites on the beads. Subsequently, 1 pmol of fluorescently labelled RNA (containing the streptavidin aptamers and RNA of interest) in DXB buffer (30 mM HEPES at pH 7.3, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 \u03bcM MgATP, and Complete [EDTA-free] protease inhibitor [Roche]) with 40 U RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI) was incubated with the blocked Dynabeads for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C. <i>Drosophila</i> embryo extracts were produced from dechorionated 0\u20136 hr wild-type embryos by homogenising in DXB buffer as described (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bullock et al., 2006</a>) using 100 \u03bcl of DXB buffer per 50 mg of embryos. Embryo extract was then centrifuged for 8 min at 9000 rpm at 4\u00b0C to remove debris. Typically, 100 \u00b5l embryo extract was added to the Dynabead\u2013RNA complex, supplemented with 40 U of RNasin and incubated for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C on a roller mixer. The magnetic beads were washed once with DXB buffer at 4\u00b0C and RNA-motor complexes eluted by incubating the Dynabeads with 200 \u00b5l of 10 mM biotin (Invitrogen) in motility buffer (30 mM HEPES/KOH, 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0) at 15\u00b0C for 20 min in a Thermomixer comfort (Eppendorf, UK; 950 rpm). Biotin competes for the interaction of the aptamer with streptavidin. In control experiments, we confirmed by immunoblotting that components of RNA-motor complexes are present in the eluate from <i>h</i><sup>WT</sup> RNA affinity purification experiments by probing for Egalitarian, Bicaudal-D and Dynein heavy chain. These factors were not present when RNA was omitted from the procedure. For motility assays the eluate was transferred immediately to ice and subsequently introduced along with 2.5 mM ATP and an oxygen scavenging system (1250 nM glucose oxidase, 140 nM of catalase, 71 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 24.9 mM glucose) into a flow chamber with polarity-marked, HiLyte 647-labelled microtubules pre-adsorbed to the coverslip. In a subset of experiments sodium orthovanadate or apyrase was added to the eluate (to a final concentration of 100 \u03bcM or 20 U\u00b7ml<sup>\u22121</sup>, respectively) before addition to the flow cell. In the apyrase experiment the eluate was not supplemented with ATP. Microtubules and Cy3-labelled RNA molecules were visualised with a TIR microscope (15 fps, that is 66 ms capture time (63 ms exposure plus 3 ms image acquisition) or 4.2 fps, that is 236 ms capture time (200 ms exposure plus 36 ms image acquisition)); unless stated otherwise, \u223c 1500 frames or \u223c700 frames were collected for 15 fps or 4.2 fps imaging, respectively. <i>HLE</i> RNPs were analysed at the lower frame rate (4.2 fps). This was because the reduced number of Cy3 dye molecules per RNA molecule compared to <i>h</i> 3\u2032UTR RNAs (see above) necessitated a longer exposure time. Experiments in which the motility of <i>h</i> 3\u2032UTR species was compared to that of <i>HLE</i> were also performed at 4.2 fps. Hence, all motility experiments in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4\u20136</a> (involving <i>HLE</i>) were performed at 4.2 fps, with all other experiments performed at 15 fps."

Random microtubules in the region-of-interest were selected, followed by analysing the RNPs that moved along them. The movement of RNPs with reference to the polarity of microtubules were analysed using TrackMate in Fiji (<a href=\"http://fiji.sc/TrackMate\">http://fiji.sc/TrackMate</a>) and a custom Matlab code (available on request). Sub-pixel XY coordinates of motile RNPs were acquired from TrackMate as described (<a href=\"http://fiji.sc/TrackMate\">http://fiji.sc/TrackMate</a>) using two-dimensional Gaussian fitting. The RNP coordinates were imported into Matlab where they were projected onto a vector along the coordinates of the microtubule (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hendricks et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rai et al., 2013</a>), thereby producing on-axis positions of the RNP with respect to the track. The difference in on-axis position between consecutive frames (termed <i>d</i>) was then calculated. The tracking accuracy was determined to be 11.3 nm (i.e., the standard deviation of instantaneous displacements of tracked immobile RNPs on microtubules [<a href=\"#bib29\">Hendricks et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>]). Runs were defined as the sum of consecutive displacements &gt;22 nm in one direction (i.e., before termination by pausing, reversal, RNP detachment, or the end of imaging). 22 nm was chosen as a cut-off as it is approximately twice the standard deviation of instantaneous displacement measurements for immobile RNPs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). A similar calculation was previously used to produce a cut-off for the analysis of the motility of neuronal vesicles in vitro (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hendricks et al., 2010</a>). Pauses were defined as \u22651 frame with an instantaneous displacement \u226422 nm. Reversals within RNP tracks were defined as instances when <i>d</i> of consecutive frames <i>i</i> and <i>i+1</i> were &gt;22 nm and the absolute value of the sign of <i>d</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> minus <i>d</i><sub><i>i+1</i></sub> equalled 2 (i.e., |sign(<i>d</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>)-sign(<i>d</i><sub><i>i+1</i></sub>)| = 2), where sign(<i>d</i>) = +1 for <i>d</i> &gt;0 and sign(<i>d</i>) = \u22121 for <i>d</i> &lt;0. The trajectories were then analysed for run length and persistence time and these values used to calculate run velocity. In control experiments, analysis of 20 s bins of RNP motion over the duration of image acquisition (100\u2013120 s) revealed that mean run length and velocity does not decrease over time. This indicates that RNA-motor complexes are relatively stable over the total period of image acquisition."

Here, Soundararajan and Bullock tackle this problem by first developing an improved in vitro motility assay for analyzing microtubule-based RNP motility. Their method relies on purifying native motor complexes from Drosophila extracts via their interaction with in vitro transcribed RNAs (hairy). Previous work from the Bullock lab has shown that dynein is recruited to these RNAs along with dynactin, Lis1, BicD and Egl. These RNP complexes exhibit a combination of unidirectional movement towards the minus end of the microtubule and bi-directional movement; no unidirectional plus end-directed motility was observed. This work then goes on to characterize these unidirectional and bidirectional types of motility."

There are some papers in the literature that suggest model 2 (dynein can either be minus or plus end-directed motor, and perhaps can convert between the two states). This would be a significant discovery if true, but convincing evidence is needed to advance the field. It is important to rule out diffusion as a mechanism; an MSD plot for one run can be misleading since a single run with limited events can produce a deviation for diffusion which could look like \u201cactive transport\u201d. Thus, this is not an easy question to answer in a convincing way. Simulation of 1-D diffusion (to see how often if produces apparent unidirectional runs) might be helpful. But better data would be most helpful. Looking at stepping behavior directly at higher resolution might be helpful. The 6 GFP RNPs should be pretty good for analyzing stepping behavior of the RNPs (how unidirectional is the motion when one gets down to &lt;10 nm resolution?). It might also be possible to attach the RNP to a Q dot. Second, is the motion in the plus end direction associated with significant force production? This could be done by attaching the RNP to a 1\u03bcm bead. Is the plus end direction associated with a \u223c6 pN force (this might be suggestive of a kinesin, but would not rule out a dynein or multiple dyneins; it would rule out diffusion)? Even a 1-2 pN force (what has been reported for a single dynein) might rule that out diffusion. It would also be powerful to show that the plus end force (like the unidirectional minus end) scales with copy number of dynein. However, if there is little force, then this would suggest a diffusive model. Although less informative than the two prior suggestions, it could be interesting to add ATP-vanadate to kill unidirectional minus end movement and see what happens to the \u201cbidirectional\u201d RNPs \u2013 is the plus end direction affected? If not, then this might be diffusional. The authors might have other ideas on how to address this issue as well. The bottom line is that the authors need to better support their explanation of an active plus end-directed motor activity. This might reveal that bidirectional motion is due to a switching behavior of the dynein motor itself. If shown convincingly, this would be very interesting and would increase the interest in the paper considerably. It could then be featured in the abstract for sure."

The outcome of this experiment showed that whereas the unidirectional minus end-directed movements depend on an active energy transducing process of dynein, the bidirectional RNPs do not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F \u2013 I</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplements 1B, C and 2C, D</a>).

For example, visualising RNP motility using fluorescence microscopy with enough precision to be able to resolve individual steps will probably require direct labelling of dynein with fluorophores, rather than indirect labelling of the cargo. Developing a method for unobtrusive labelling of dynein is of course time-consuming in a system that deals with native motor complexes from an animal model. There would also be considerable complexity associated with resolving the position of individual dyneins within a multi-dynein cargo-motor assembly. Optical trap experiments would require attaching a large bead to individual RNPs, which (a) is technically not trivial and (b) would not be physiological."

There are some papers in the literature that suggest model 2 (dynein can either be minus or plus end-directed motor, and perhaps can convert between the two states). This would be a significant discovery if true, but convincing evidence is needed to advance the field. It is important to rule out diffusion as a mechanism; an MSD plot for one run can be misleading since a single run with limited events can produce a deviation for diffusion which could look like \u201cactive transport\u201d. Thus, this is not an easy question to answer in a convincing way. Simulation of 1-D diffusion (to see how often if produces apparent unidirectional runs) might be helpful. But better data would be most helpful. Looking at stepping behavior directly at higher resolution might be helpful. The 6 GFP RNPs should be pretty good for analyzing stepping behavior of the RNPs (how unidirectional is the motion when one gets down to &lt;10 nm resolution?). It might also be possible to attach the RNP to a Q dot. Second, is the motion in the plus end direction associated with significant force production? This could be done by attaching the RNP to a 1\u03bcm bead. Is the plus end direction associated with a \u223c6 pN force (this might be suggestive of a kinesin, but would not rule out a dynein or multiple dyneins; it would rule out diffusion)? Even a 1-2 pN force (what has been reported for a single dynein) might rule that out diffusion. It would also be powerful to show that the plus end force (like the unidirectional minus end) scales with copy number of dynein. However, if there is little force, then this would suggest a diffusive model. Although less informative than the two prior suggestions, it could be interesting to add ATP-vanadate to kill unidirectional minus end movement and see what happens to the \u201cbidirectional\u201d RNPs \u2013 is the plus end direction affected?

However, as included in a letter to Prof. Schekman after the initial reviews, we think that a scenario in which bidirectional RNPs exclusively undergo passive diffusion along the microtubule is no less interesting than our previous model. This is particularly the case given recent evidence in <i>S. pombe</i> that dynein can undergo diffusive motion along microtubules in vivo (Ananthanarayanan et al. Cell, 2013. PMID 23791180). In fact, our new data substantially clarify the interpretation of our whole study. They lead to a novel model in which the same cargo species can associate with processive or non-processive dynein, with discrete cargo-associated features controlling switching between the two behaviours. This work therefore also paves the way for identifying factors and mechanisms that regulate dynein processivity. Our realisation that bidirectional motion is principally driven by diffusion also refines substantially our interpretations of the experiments assessing the behaviour of RNPs at MAPs and microtubule ends."
