Our crystal structure of the mitochondrial Hsp90, TRAP1, revealed an extension of the N-terminal \u03b2-strand previously shown to cross between protomers in the closed state. In this study, we address the regulatory function of this extension or \u2018strap\u2019 and demonstrate its responsibility for an unusual temperature dependence in ATPase rates. This dependence is a consequence of a thermally sensitive kinetic barrier between the apo \u2018open\u2019 and ATP-bound \u2018closed\u2019 conformations. The strap stabilizes the closed state through trans-protomer interactions. Displacement of cis-protomer contacts from the apo state is rate-limiting for closure and ATP hydrolysis. Strap release is coupled to rotation of the N-terminal domain and dynamics of the nucleotide binding pocket lid. The strap is conserved in higher eukaryotes but absent from yeast and prokaryotes suggesting its role as a thermal and kinetic regulator, adapting Hsp90s to the demands of unique cellular and organismal environments."

Our crystal structure of the mitochondrial Hsp90, TRAP1, revealed an extension of the N-terminal \u03b2-strand previously shown to cross between protomers in the closed state. In this study, we address the regulatory function of this extension or \u2018strap\u2019 and demonstrate its responsibility for an unusual temperature dependence in ATPase rates. This dependence is a consequence of a thermally sensitive kinetic barrier between the apo \u2018open\u2019 and ATP-bound \u2018closed\u2019 conformations. The strap stabilizes the closed state through trans-protomer interactions. Displacement of cis-protomer contacts from the apo state is rate-limiting for closure and ATP hydrolysis. Strap release is coupled to rotation of the N-terminal domain and dynamics of the nucleotide binding pocket lid. The strap is conserved in higher eukaryotes but absent from yeast and prokaryotes suggesting its role as a thermal and kinetic regulator, adapting Hsp90s to the demands of unique cellular and organismal environments."

Before a newly made protein can work properly, the amino acid chain has to be folded into the correct three-dimensional shape. Many proteins that have folded incorrectly are harmless, but some can disrupt the cell and cause damage. Although most proteins can fold properly on their own, they are often helped by \u2018chaperone\u2019 proteins, which speed up the process and encourage correct folding."

High temperatures can severely impair and destabilize proper protein folding, and the heat shock proteins counteract this by helping to prevent, or correct, protein misfolding. Most animals and plants have at least four genes that make different versions of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). These versions work in different places in the cell and one\u2014called TRAP1\u2014is found in internal compartments called mitochondria. Along with its role in assisting protein folding, TRAP1 also acts as an indicator of the health of the proteins in the mitochondria."

This releases energy that is used to change the shape of the protein-binding domain\u2014which is responsible for helping other proteins to fold. Recent studies of TRAP1 using a technique called protein crystallography highlighted the presence of a short amino acid tail or \u2018strap\u2019 at one end of the protein, but it is not known what role it may play in protein folding."

Similar straps are also present in the Hsp90 proteins that are found in other parts of the cell. However, the strap is absent from the Hsp90 proteins of yeast and bacteria. These experiments used proteins that had been taken from living cells and placed in an artificial setting, so an important next step will be to study the role of the strap in the folding of proteins inside living cells. Also, future work could investigate the potential role of the protein in maintaining healthy mitochondria."

Although molecular chaperones generally promote protein folding and prevent aggregation, Hsp90 is unique in that it interacts with substrate (\u2018client\u2019) proteins that are already in a semi-folded state to facilitate downstream protein\u2013protein interactions and promote client function in diverse biological pathways (<a href=\"#bib10\">Jakob et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Taipale et al., 2012</a>). Hsp90 interacts with nearly 10% of the eukaryotic proteome (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zhao et al., 2005</a>), and its client proteins vary significantly in sequence, structure, and size (<a href=\"#bib5\">Echeverria et al., 2011</a>). In most eukaryotes, there are four different Hsp90 homologs: Hsp90\u03b1 and Hsp90\u03b2 in the cytoplasm, Grp94 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and TRAP1 in mitochondria, with each homolog contributing unique biological functions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Johnson, 2012</a>). Deregulation of Hsp90 protein levels and function has been linked to multiple human diseases and for this reason Hsp90 is a target for biochemical characterization, structural studies, and drug discovery (<a href=\"#bib20\">Luo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Taipale et al., 2010</a>). Despite such importance, little is known about the biochemical characteristics that regulate client interaction and specificity."

The N-terminal domain (NTD) binds to ATP, the C-terminal domain (CTD) provides a dimerization interface between protomers, and the middle domain (MD) provides a stabilizing \u03b3-phosphate contact to help facilitate ATP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cunningham et al., 2012</a>). Together with the CTD, the MD has been shown to aid in the formation of client interactions (<a href=\"#bib32\">Street et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Genest et al., 2013</a>). Large, rigid body motions about each of the domain interfaces give rise to an ensemble of remarkably diverse conformational states that dictate the functional Hsp90 cycle (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ali et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Shiau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Dollins et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Southworth and Agard, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Lavery et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) and are linked to client maturation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib23\">Panaretou et al., 1998</a>). Work from numerous labs has demonstrated conservation of the underlying conformational cycle and mechanism; however, each Hsp90 homolog has a distinct conformational equilibrium and catalytic rate (<a href=\"#bib23\">Panaretou et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Richter et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Southworth and Agard, 2008</a>). Binding of ATP to the NTD nucleotide-binding pocket ultimately leads to stabilization of an NTD-dimerized state. Key steps in this transformation include ATP binding, closure of a mobile structure (lid) over the nucleotide, and a subsequent 90<sup>o</sup> rotation of the NTD relative to the MD (<a href=\"#bib14\">Krukenberg et al., 2011</a>). Dimer closure is the rate-limiting step for Hsp90 ATPase activity and mutations that either subtly increase or decrease ATPase rates compromise viability in yeast (<a href=\"#bib22\">Nathan and Lindquist, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Hessling et al., 2009</a>). However, our understanding of the sequence of events that regulate these structural rearrangements is limited."

Of particular note was the marked asymmetry between protomers of the homodimer, primarily at the interface between the MD and CTD. This asymmetry was sampled in solution, proved essential for catalytic turnover, and provided a new model for coupling the energy of ATP hydrolysis to client remodeling. A second feature highlighted by the TRAP1 crystal structure was an ordered 14-residue extension (out of 26 total additional residues) of the N-terminal \u03b2-strand previously shown to cross over (\u2018swap\u2019) between protomers in the closed state (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ali et al., 2006</a>). While absent in yeast and bacteria, this extension, or \u2018strap,\u2019 is found in most eukaryotic Hsp90 proteins including the cytosolic and organellar forms (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2006</a>) and can extend for as many as 122 residues as recently found in a splice variant of Hsp90\u03b1 in higher eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tripathi and Obermann, 2013</a>). Structure based point mutations and complete removal of the TRAP1 strap (\u0394strap) resulted in a sixfold increase in ATPase activity in zebrafish TRAP1 (zTRAP1) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lavery et al., 2014</a>), evidence that the strap plays a regulatory role. Similarly, deletion of the strap in Grp94 (residues 22-72, referred to as the \u2018pre-N domain\u2019) resulted in a fivefold increase in ATPase (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dollins et al., 2007</a>), indicative of a conserved regulatory role, although the mechanism remains unclear."

Using negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), we demonstrate that removal of the strap results in a profound reduction in the temperature sensitivity observed in multiple TRAP1 homologs, indicating that the strap is responsible for this unique behavior. Additionally, we develop fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and continuous-wave EPR (CW-EPR) assays to show that the strap regulates the rate-limiting conformational transitions that precede NTD dimerization, including NTD rotation and lid closure over the ATP-binding pocket. These results indicate that the strap must stabilize both the apo state and the closed state, providing a unique evolutionary strategy for modulating different phases of the kinetic landscape and optimizing in vivo function of diverse Hsp90s."

However, the extent of closed-state accumulated and the rate of closure differentiated the Hsp90s with the individual values positively correlating with the ATP hydrolysis rate (<a href=\"#bib28\">Richter et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Southworth and Agard, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Hessling et al., 2009</a>). Specifically, we used EM to demonstrate that the large variability in observed ATPase rates of cytosolic bacterial (bHsp90), yeast (yHsp90), and human Hsp90 (hHsp90), directly correlated with the ability of each homolog to reach a closed conformation in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP (AMPPNP) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Southworth and Agard, 2008</a>). Here, negative-stain EM was again used to monitor the ability of human TRAP1 (hTRAP1) to transition from the apo conformation to the closed conformation in the presence of AMPPNP. While hTRAP1 has an ATPase rate similar to the <i>E. coli</i> Hsp90 (\u223c0.5 min<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cunningham et al., 2012</a>), surprisingly hTRAP1 remained in the open conformation despite incubation with saturating AMPPNP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Noting that the discrepancy might be related to different incubation temperatures between the two experiments, we monitored the ability of hTRAP1:AMPPNP to close as a function of temperature. After 1 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) or overnight (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) incubation at room temperature (RT, \u223c23\u00b0C) hTRAP1 remained in the open state. However, after a single hour of incubation at increasing temperatures, the closed state was increasingly populated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). These results correlate well with the temperature sensitive steady-state hydrolysis rates of hTRAP1 that increases by nearly 200-fold between 25\u00b0C and 55\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib16\">Leskovar et al., 2008</a>) and are consistent with closure being rate-limiting for hydrolysis. Importantly, the equilibrium reached at each temperature (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) remains fixed after subsequent incubation at RT overnight (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These data suggest both a large, unusually thermally sensitive kinetic barrier to closure and a highly stable closed state."

The ordered strap extension observed in the zTRAP1 structure is also kinetically important, as \u0394strap (deletion of zTRAP1 residues 73\u2013100) and a single point mutant aimed at disrupting a conserved, stabilizing salt bridge at the beginning of the strap, accelerated hydrolysis by sixfold and fourfold, respectively.

These data together with previously solved crystal structures of other Hsp90 N-terminal domains displaying cis-contacts of the initial \u03b2-strand suggest that the strap likely makes equivalent contacts with the same NTD (cis) in the apo state that it forms with the trans-NTD in the closed state (<a href=\"#bib30\">Shiau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Dollins et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Li et al., 2012</a>)."

Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) provides a more convenient method than SAXS to directly measure the rate of closure (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hessling et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mickler et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Street et al., 2011</a>). Two FRET constructs were designed to probe distinct aspects of the closure reaction, relying on a Cys-free version of hTRAP1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lavery et al., 2014</a>). The first construct modeled from FRET positions previously designed for yHsp90 placed a single Cys residue on each protomer (E140C and E407C, \u2018Inter FRET\u2019) so as to give an increase in FRET upon closure (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hessling et al., 2009</a>). The second construct modeled on previous work with bHsp90 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Street et al., 2012</a>), adds two Cys residues to a single protomer (S133C and E407C, \u2018Intra FRET\u2019), and is designed to track the \u223c90<sup>o</sup> NTD rotation (relative to the MD) that occurs upon closure. After forming heterodimers, closure reactions were initiated with AMPPNP over a temperature range mirroring our SAXS experiments and the change in FRET was monitored. Pre- and post-reaction fluorescent scans showed a predicted FRET change indicative of closure for each FRET construct (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). As expected, the rate of closure correlated with increasing temperature (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>) for both dimer closure and NTD:MD rotation measurements. To measure the contribution of the strap to the kinetics of closure, we truncated the strap region of either one or both protomers in each FRET construct (although the dimeric \u0394strap construct used to measure NTD rotation proved too unstable to obtain reliable data). In both cases, a large acceleration of closure was apparent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) with the largest acceleration (16-fold) observed for the double-strap deletion."

At every temperature sampled removing the strap results in an acceleration of closure compared to WT and an overall loss in temperature dependence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Comparing the fold changes in closure rates (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>), we see the largest fold change at lower temperatures (23\u00b0C: 24-fold, 30\u00b0C: 16-fold, 32\u00b0C: 12-fold, 36\u00b0C: sevenfold, and 42\u00b0C: threefold). This increased impact at lower temperatures is readily evident in an Arrhenius plot calculated from the inter FRET experiments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). The resultant activation energies (E<sub>a</sub>) taken from the slopes of these curves are 48.8 kcal/mol and 29 kcal/mol, for WT and \u0394strap respectively. From the difference, the strap appears to be contributing \u223c20 kcal/mol towards the E<sub>a</sub> of WT hTRAP1, which we interpret as \u223c 20 kcal/mol of enthalpic stabilization of the open state. Our E<sub>a</sub> for WT hTRAP1 is consistent with that measured previously under slightly different conditions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Leskovar et al., 2008</a>), but is considerably higher than that calculated for other Hsp90 homologs (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Frey et al., 2007</a>). As a control, we also measured steady-state ATPase rates on the labeled protein used for the FRET experiments. While these showed differences in absolute ATPase rates between 1.5 and fourfold compared with their unlabeled counterparts (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2 and 3</a>), the relative impact of strap deletion was consistent across experiments. Together, these data support a model in which the N-terminal strap limits closure by inhibiting the rotational movement of the NTD that is necessary to form the catalytically active closed state."

Previous studies with yHsp90 have suggested a correlation between the \u2018\u03b2-strand swap\u2019 and dynamics of the NTD lid (<a href=\"#bib27\">Richter et al., 2006</a>). In an open conformation and prior to nucleotide binding, the lid makes contacts with helix 1 (H1) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Richter et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Shiau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Dollins et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Li et al., 2012</a>), while in the closed state the lid rotates to secure nucleotide via interactions at conserved sidechains (Ser193 and Ser195 in zTRAP1) inside the nucleotide binding pocket (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ali et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Lavery et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2 and 3</a>).

                                "text": "To test whether the strap has a role in lid stabilization, we developed an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy assay to track lid mobility in the apo and closed states (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). A cys-free version of zTRAP1 with an Ala201Cys mutation allowed labeling of a fully accessible cysteine residue in the lid with N-(1-oxyl- 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl)maleimide (MSL). We observed a small difference in ATPase activity with the MSL-labeled TRAP1 compared with ATPase rates measured using WT TRAP1 suggesting a minor labeling effect on steady-state catalytic turnover (\u223c1.3 fold). EPR spectra are sensitive to the rotational mobility of the attached MSL probe making it a useful reporter for changes in local conformational dynamics (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hubbell et al., 2000</a>). EPR spectra of full-length zTRAP1 were recorded at 23\u00b0C and shown to be more mobile in the nucleotide bound state compared to the apo state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Mobility of the lid as measured with EPR is consistent with apo structures showing low B-factors in this region due to significant contacts with H1 of the cis protomer (<a href=\"#bib27\">Richter et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Shiau et al., 2006</a>). Conversely, crystal structures of TRAP1 and other Hsp90 homologs bound to ATP analogs in the closed and dimerized conformation show that the lid folds over the nucleotide, has increased B-factors and lacks many of the stabilizing contacts with the N-terminal domain found in the apo state (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ali et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Lavery et al., 2014</a>). This is consistent with the mobile signature in the EPR observed for the closed conformation. Comparing apo state equilibrium measurements for WT and \u0394strap shows little change upon strap deletion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Fortunately EPR is sufficiently sensitive and the closure kinetics for TRAP1 are sufficiently slow, that it is possible to directly monitor changes in lid state over time. By plotting the change in normalized peak heights over time (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), it is apparent that the amplitude changes for both the mobile and immobile peaks are well fit by a single exponential curve for each sample. From this, it is clear that the rate of change between states as monitored by lid mobility is much faster for the \u0394strap sample than for WT. The fold difference between rates is on the order of changes in ATPase rates under conditions used in the EPR experiment (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Altogether, these data suggest that the local conformational changes of lid closure and NTD-rotation are part of the rate-limiting barrier to the closed state and are regulated by N-terminal residues of the strand swap and extended strap in TRAP1."

Moreover, it appears to be also responsible for the pronounced temperature-sensitivity. Although the experiments above indicate a strong role in modulating the forward closure rate, the TRAP1 crystal structure would suggest that deleting the strap might also compromise the stability of the closed state, thereby enhancing reopening rate and shifting the equilibrium towards the open state. To measure the re-opening rate, inter FRET-labeled hTRAP1 was pre-closed with AMPPNP. After closure was complete a 20-fold excess ADP was added such that upon re-opening of the NTD dimer interface, ADP would exchange resulting in a decreased FRET signal (<a href=\"#bib32\">Street et al., 2011</a>). Previous studies found apo state nucleotide on and off-rates to be fast (<a href=\"#bib16\">Leskovar et al., 2008</a>), thus the above experiment provides a good approximation of the uni-molecular reopening rate. Monitoring FRET kinetics revealed that strap removal accelerated re-opening of the NTD dimer interface by \u223ceightfold (0.0021 min<sup>\u22121</sup> \u2192 0.016 min<sup>\u22121</sup>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>).

                                "text": "Because the strap could also play a role in the hydrolysis reaction, we needed a method to decouple closure from ATP hydrolysis. As closure is rate-limiting, even single-turnover experiments would provide an aggregate rate made up of the closure and hydrolysis steps. During the course of our FRET experiments, we discovered that omitting Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the reaction buffer results in an accumulation of the closed-state in the presence of ATP without ATP hydrolysis. By contrast, in the presence of ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, TRAP1 is predominantly in the apo state as a consequence of hydrolysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,D</a>). The latter is consistent with previous observations with yHsp90 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hessling et al., 2009</a>) and bHsp90. These observations allowed us to decouple the closure and hydrolysis steps by pre-incubating TRAP1 with excess ATP without Mg<sup>2+</sup>, thereby stalling the reaction in the closed state (illustrated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Upon addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ATP is hydrolyzed and the equilibrium shifts predominantly to the apo state as seen by the loss of FRET (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Testing WT and \u0394strap in this assay revealed an acceleration of closure with removal of the strap, consistent with experiments using AMPPNP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Interestingly, the closure rate measured by FRET is significantly faster with ATP than AMPPNP suggesting a significant difference in energetics between the nucleotide analogs (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). The use of ATP for FRET-based closure measurements better matches our ATPase measurements and points to a correlation between closure rates and ATPase activity (0.79 min<sup>\u22121</sup> ATPase vs 0.42 min<sup>\u22121</sup> FRET Closure, both measurements with Inter FRET probe protein), though we do still observe a difference perhaps representing a small Mg<sup>2+</sup> contribution. Addition of excess Mg<sup>2+</sup> showed the predicted drop in FRET and revealed a minor difference in hydrolysis rate (\u223c1.4-fold) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>), suggesting that the strap may also subtly alter lid dynamics in the closed state. The acceleration effects observed for the \u0394strap protein are greater at 25\u00b0C, where the temperature dependent difference is more pronounced (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Notably, our measured closure and hydrolysis rates matched previously reported values for these steps modeled using a global fitting procedure (<a href=\"#bib16\">Leskovar et al., 2008</a>). However, the closure and hydrolysis rates measured here (0.003 s<sup>\u22121</sup> and 0.07 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, respectively) were somewhat arbitrarily assigned to the reverse order in the previously reported model. Since our experiments independently measure both reactions, we can now assign closure to be the slowest and hence rate-limiting step. This model is in good agreement with the other data presented in this study."

One exception is a recently discovered Hsp90\u03b1 alternative splice variant that creates a very large N-terminal extension of 122 residues.

By contrast, Grp94 has a very long and very well conserved strap region, with a somewhat variable, but very acidic N-terminus. Despite its long size, deleting the analogous strap region in Grp94 accelerates ATP hydrolysis by only fivefold, although temperature modulation was not investigated (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dollins et al., 2007</a>).

In support of this, yHsp90 mutations that accelerate or decelerate ATPase rates result in significant growth defects and loss of client protein folding in vivo (<a href=\"#bib22\">Nathan and Lindquist, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Prodromou et al., 2000</a>). The evolution of additional residues at the N-terminus of the Hsp90 gene provides a convenient way to adapt the chaperone's conformational cycle to function with diverse clients encountered by the different homologs or under stressed environmental conditions. Additionally, while the cytosolic Hsp90s are highly regulated by several co-chaperones (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zuehlke and Johnson, 2010</a>), only one co-chaperone has been identified for the organellar homologs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Liu et al., 2010</a>).

Additionally, added contacts that the strap provides could be a target for post-translation modifications or even provide a novel binding site for ions, metabolites, or other factors that could modulate the regulatory functions of this element. These observations provide an example of how evolved extensions at the Hsp90 N-terminus can be used to fine-tune chaperone activity to match organism-specific environmental conditions or unique subcellular demands required for optimal function."

Each sample collected was subsequently buffer subtracted and time points were averaged using scripts provided at beamline 12.3.1 and our own in-house software \u2018saxs_multiavg.py\u2019. The scattering data were transformed to P(r) vs r using the program GNOM (<a href=\"#bib35\">Svergun, 1992</a>) and Dmax was optimized. The resulting distributions were fit using an in-house least squares fitting program \u2018saxs_combine.py\u2019 in the region where non-zero data were present for the target data and closed state model. For the fitting we chose theoretical scattering data for our TRAP1 closed-state model (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lavery et al., 2014</a>) and the WT apo data for each TRAP1 homolog. The WT apo data were chosen as the best representation of apo for two reasons. (1) The apo state of Hsp90 proteins consist of a mix of conformations (<a href=\"#bib31\">Southworth and Agard, 2008</a>) of which the various conformations and percent of each remains to be elucidated for TRAP1, and (2) removal of the strap (particularly in hTRAP1) induces a shift of the apo distribution towards the closed state as observed for hTRAP1 by SAXS (data not shown), which would result in a value of percent closed for the \u0394strap protein that would under represent the true value relative to WT. The theoretical scattering curve for the TRAP1 crystal structure was generated in the program CRYSOL (<a href=\"#bib34\">Svergun et al., 1995</a>). The percent of components utilized in the fit and an R factor (R_merge) that is similar to a crystallography R factor in nature is output from our least-squares fitting program and values reported in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>.

This 'strap' is found in higher eukaryotes but is absent in yeast and bacteria. The authors also showed that point mutations or the deletion of the strap in TRAP1 (of zebra fish) or endoplasmic Grp94 results in an increase in ATPase activity. In this study, they show that a temperature-dependent kinetic barrier limits the conformational changes from the apo to the closed form of TRAP1. At lower temperature (23\u00b0C) TRAP1is predominantly open, even in the presence of AMPPNP. Local conformational changes associated with lid closure are a part of the rate limiting step to the closed state and are regulated by the strap in TRAP1."

They characterized the effects of the strap on the dimer closure kinetics, the rotation of the N-domain relative to the M-domain, the ATP hydrolysis and movement of the ATP lid (N-domain) using negative stain electron microscopy (EM), small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements.

We have also included a quantification of the activation energy for Hsp90 homologs (yHsp90 and Grp94) in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2</a>, utilizing previously reported rates found in Frey et al 2007. Comparing our calculated activation energy as well as a previously reported value (Leskovar et al 2008), we find that the other homologs have significantly lower activation energies. These data clearly show that TRAP1 has unusually large response to temperature changes."

Though we have not measured the temperature dependence of closure with ATP at the full range of temperatures as AMPPNP, we do show that the closure rate is slower at 25 \u00b0C and that the fold difference in closure rate is greater between WT and \u0394strap protein at 25 \u00b0C (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). The difference between the ATP analogs suggests that the energetics differ which could shift (but not mitigate) the observed temperature dependence of closure depending on the analog used. Importantly, we point out that despite experimental differences that could arise due to cysteine removal, labelling, or usage of varying nucleotide, our observation of the unique temperature dependent closure (also supported by Leskovar et al 2008) and the role of the strap as a structural element responsible for regulating this observation remains constant across all experiments in our manuscript."

Rather, we measure a FRET signal that is always equivalent to Apo (no change from time zero). This was also seen in FRET studies with yeast Hsp90 (yHsp90) in Hessling et al, 2009. We noted the differences in the manuscript as an observation, however we feel uncovering the molecular reason for variability of rates and affinity between the two ATP analogs is beyond the scope of this manuscript. While interesting, here our focus is on the changes in these rates that are connected with the strap."

They characterized the effects of the strap on the dimer closure kinetics, the rotation of the N-domain relative to the M-domain, the ATP hydrolysis and movement of the ATP lid (N-domain) using negative stain electron microscopy (EM), small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements.
