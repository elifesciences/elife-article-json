We present the crystal structure of a C-terminal part of HUWE1, including the catalytic domain, and reveal an asymmetric auto-inhibited dimer. We show that HUWE1 dimerizes in solution and self-associates in cells, and that both occurs through the crystallographic dimer interface. We demonstrate that HUWE1 is inhibited in cells and that it can be activated by disruption of the dimer interface. We identify a conserved segment in HUWE1 that counteracts dimer formation by associating with the dimerization region intramolecularly. Our studies reveal, intriguingly, that the tumor suppressor p14ARF binds to this segment and may thus shift the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 toward the inactive state. We propose a model, in which the activity of HUWE1 underlies conformational control in response to physiological cues\u2014a mechanism that may be exploited for cancer therapy."

We present the crystal structure of a C-terminal part of HUWE1, including the catalytic domain, and reveal an asymmetric auto-inhibited dimer. We show that HUWE1 dimerizes in solution and self-associates in cells, and that both occurs through the crystallographic dimer interface. We demonstrate that HUWE1 is inhibited in cells and that it can be activated by disruption of the dimer interface. We identify a conserved segment in HUWE1 that counteracts dimer formation by associating with the dimerization region intramolecularly. Our studies reveal, intriguingly, that the tumor suppressor p14ARF binds to this segment and may thus shift the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 toward the inactive state. We propose a model, in which the activity of HUWE1 underlies conformational control in response to physiological cues\u2014a mechanism that may be exploited for cancer therapy."

HUWE1 is overexpressed in many tumors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Confalonieri et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Adhikary et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yoon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Myant et al., 2016</a>) and has been studied intensively in this context. Surprisingly, both pro-oncogenic and tumor-suppressor functions of HUWE1 have been documented in different tumor models. This is reflected in the range of HUWE1 substrates: HUWE1 can target oncoproteins, such as N-MYC, C-MYC (<a href=\"#bib45\">Myant et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Inoue et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Zhao et al., 2009</a>), and MCL1 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Myant et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Zhong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Warr et al., 2005</a>), but also the tumor suppressor protein p53 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2005</a>) and the co-factor of MYC, MIZ1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Inoue et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Yang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Peter et al., 2014</a>) for degradation. Additionally, the functional role of HUWE1 may be context-dependent, since HUWE1 is capable of activating the transcription of either MYC/MIZ1-induced or -repressed target genes in a cell-type-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib3\">Adhikary et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Myant et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Inoue et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Peter et al., 2014</a>)."

However, p19ARF, the mouse orthologue of human p14ARF, inhibits proliferation of <i>p53</i>- and <i>Mdm2</i>-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts, formally demonstrating that ARF has growth-suppressive functions that are independent of both p53 and MDM2 (<a href=\"#bib67\">Weber et al., 2000</a>). The nature of the p53-independent functions of p14ARF has been intensively debated (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sherr, 2006</a>). One candidate mechanism is the inhibition of nucleolar function and ribosome assembly, which is mediated by associations of p14ARF with nucleophosmin and the SUMO-protease SENP3 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bertwistle et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Itahana et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Maggi et al., 2014</a>).

In an intermediate step, a catalytic cysteine residue of the HECT ligase forms a thioester bond with the C-terminus of ubiquitin. The activated carbonyl group of ubiquitin is then nucleophilically attacked by the \u03b5-amino group of a lysine residue of the substrate. This results in the formation of an isopeptide linkage between ubiquitin and the substrate. If ubiquitin, in turn, acts as a substrate, this process leads to the formation of a ubiquitin chain."

The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; a comprehensive B-factor analysis is provided in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>."

C-lobe mobility, however, as enabled by a flexible linker between the N- and C-lobes of the HECT domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), is required for HECT E3 activity (<a href=\"#bib65\">Verdecia et al., 2003</a>). We thus predict that the conformation of molecule B in the crystal reflects an auto-inhibited state. This interpretation is underscored by the fact that the dimer interface buries a particular region of the C-lobe, including Leu 4335, Met 4359, and Leu 4362 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The homologous region in NEDD4-type E3 enzymes has been shown to interact with ubiquitin, thereby facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the E3 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Maspero et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kamadurai et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

This region contains a phenylalanine four residues from the C-terminus (Phe 4371), known as \u2018\u22124 Phe\u2019, that is conserved across the HECT E3 family (<a href=\"#bib57\">Salvat et al., 2004</a>)\u00a0and has a critical role in the transfer of ubiquitin from its thioester-linked state at the E3 active site to lysine residues, presumably by anchoring the C-lobe at a specific position on the N-lobe (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kamadurai et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Salvat et al., 2004</a>) and/or by interacting with ubiquitin. Consistently, truncation of the C-lobe by four residues or mutation of \u22124 Phe was found to inhibit the\u00a0auto-ubiquitination\u00a0acitivities of various HECT E3\u00a0enzymes, including the HECT domain of HUWE1 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Verdecia et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Maspero et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kamadurai et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pandya et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Salvat et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mari et al., 2014</a>). However, the position of \u22124 Phe has rarely been resolved in crystal structures of HECT domains (<a href=\"#bib80\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kamadurai et al., 2013</a>), which may be due to\u00a0the flexibility of the C-tail in the absence of substrates.\u00a0Our crystal structure of HUWE1 has the C-tail of molecule B fully resolved (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). \u22124 Phe is buried at the dimer interface, where it interacts with Phe 3955, Phe 3958, and the aliphatic side chain portion of Lys 3954 of molecule A in trans, and with Leu 4335 and Leu 4362 of the C-lobe in cis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This tight engagement of \u22124 Phe at the dimer interface is incompatible with the C-tail reaching out to the N-lobe, as seen in an\u00a0active\u00a0conformation of the NEDD4-type E3 RSP5 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kamadurai et al., 2013</a>). Taken together, we conclude that the conformation of molecule B in our crystal structure of HUWE1 represents an auto-inhibited state."

The MALS-derived MWs of 63 and 64 kDa for the I3969A and F3982A variants, respectively, are significantly lower than the MW derived for the WT (79 kDa), indicating that the conformational equilibria of these variants are shifted toward the monomeric state.

Another cancer-associated, non-conservative amino acid substitution occurs at His 3962 (upper aerodigestive tract carcinoma: H3962D [<a href=\"http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/\">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/</a>]).

Considering that one subunit of the crystallographic dimer presents an auto-inhibited state, we thus expected the ensemble of molecules\u00a0to be inhibited in solution and\u00a0a disruption of the dimer interface to\u00a0enhance the catalytic activity of HUWE1 overall. We tested this idea by comparing the auto-ubiquitination activities of HUWE1 (3951\u20134374) WT with the dimerization-deficient variants I3969A, F3982A, I3969A/F3982A, and H3962D in vitro at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 \u03bcM, that\u00a0is, below and above the K<sub>D</sub>-value of dimerization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We find that all of the mutated variants are, indeed, more active than the WT. The stimulatory effect is most pronounced for the double mutant variant, I3969A/F3982A, consistent with the dimer being most destabilized for this variant. The activity of HUWE1 WT decreases slightly with increasing protein concentrations, which can be explained, at least qualitatively, by concentration-dependent changes in the population of the dimeric state."

This elongated construct, therefore, also dimerizes. Surprisingly, however, an additional construct extension by a preceding \u03b1-helical region (HUWE1 [3843\u20134374]) results in a marked shift of the SEC elution peak toward larger volumes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) and a MALS-derived MW of 60 kDa that approximates the calculated monomeric MW of this construct (65 kDa). Similarly, the two longest constructs, HUWE1 (3810\u20134374) and (3759\u20134374), do not dimerize, as revealed by MALS analysis (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

Indeed, HUWE1 (3843\u20134374) displays similarly high activity as the isolated HECT domain.

When comparing the amino acid sequences of the activation segment and the dimerization region, we noticed a striking degree of similarity (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). In particular, a hydrophobic motif in the thumb region, \u2018FAVLVxxxxV\u2019 (residues 3982\u20133991) recurs in almost identical form in the activation segment (residues 3874\u20133883). Remarkably, most of the residues in the dimerization region that are conserved in the activation segment (or that are at least substituted by similar amino acids) coincide with residues that participate in the dimer interface. Those include Ile 3969 and Phe 3982 that we found to be critical for dimer stability. Based on these analyses, we hypothesized that the activation segment may be able to interact with the dimerization region intramolecularly.

In a series of binding and co-expression studies with truncated p14ARF variants, we identified a minimal region comprising residues 45\u201364 of p14ARF as a major binding site for HUWE1 (data not shown). To map the corresponding binding site for p14ARF on HUWE1, we monitored the interactions between a p14ARF-derived peptide (comprising residues 45\u201364) and our panel of HUWE1 constructs by fluorescence polarization (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Interestingly, we find that all HUWE1 constructs that contain the activation segment, that\u00a0is, HUWE1 (3759\u20134374), HUWE1 (3810\u20134374), and HUWE1 (3843\u20134374), bind to the p14ARF-peptide with dissociation constants in the low micromolar range (7.7, 6, and 5.2 \u03bcM, respectively). In contrast, shorter constructs of HUWE1 that are lacking the activation segment display significantly weaker affinities for p14ARF, with dissociation constants ranging from 230 to 340 \u03bcM. These results indicate that a major binding site for p14ARF resides either in the activation segment itself or in a conformational state of HUWE1, whose population depends on the activation segment. To discriminate between these possibilities, we determined the affinity of the p14ARF-peptide for the isolated activation segment (HUWE1 [3843\u20133902], tagged with MBP). The resulting dissociation constant,\u00a03.6 \u03bcM, is similar to the ones determined for the activation segment in the context of the HECT domain. This implies that a major binding site for p14ARF on HUWE1 resides in the activation segment."

Yet, the relative stimulatory effects of the mutations are different. When monitoring the auto-ubiquitination capacity of HUWE1 in vitro, the activity enhancement\u00a0observed\u00a0for the I3969A and F3982 variants compared to the WT is relatively similar. In the cell, however, the F3982A variant stimulates the ubiquitination of physiological HUWE1 substrates more strongly than the I3969A variant. Notably, our cell-based assays were performed with large HUWE1 constructs (2474\u20134374) that include the activation segment, while the in vitro assays were based on the crystallization construct, HUWE1 (3951\u20134374), that lacks the activation segment. It is possible that the mutated residues, both of which are pivotal for the integrity of the dimer interface, contribute differently to the alternate intramolecular interaction between the dimerization region and the activation segment. To characterize this latter interaction structurally and to delineate the conformational transition of HUWE1 from the dimeric, auto-inhibited to the monomeric, active state of HUWE1 will be an important aim of future studies."

With an in vitro dissociation constant of ~3 \u03bcM, the dimerization of the C-terminal region of HUWE1 (residues 3951\u20134374) may appear relatively weak. However, affinities in the low micromolar range (and even above) are not unusual in the ubiquitin system and have been observed, for instance, for the interactions between E2 and E3 enzymes (<a href=\"#bib77\">Ye and Rape, 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib12\">Eletr and Kuhlman, 2007</a>), between ubiquitin and ubiquitin-binding domains (<a href=\"#bib22\">Husnjak et al., 2012</a>), and between ubiquitin and E2\u00a0enzymes or E2/E3 complexes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buetow et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hofmann and Pickart, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wickliffe et al., 2011</a>). While these affinities, as determined in vitro, are typically altered by avidity and/or allovalency effects in the cellular context, it still emerges that ubiquitination enzymes have evolved to act through the sequential formation of rather weak protein interfaces. This feature may benefit the dynamic handover of reaction products throughout the catalytic cascade, the efficient assembly of ubiquitin chains, and the fine-tuned interplay of ubiquitination and deubiquitination enzymes."

Importantly, the local concentrations of HUWE1 at its cellular sites of action are expected to be significantly higher, due to the effects of cellular compartimentalization and protein co-localization. Considering the large size of HUWE1 (482 kDa) and, accordingly, the large number of its interaction partners, co-localization effects likely have a particularly pronounced impact on the local concentrations of HUWE1 and, therefore, on its propensity to dimerize (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ispolatov et al., 2005</a>). Hence, even seemingly weak interactions of HUWE1, as determined in vitro, can be expected to fall into a physiologically meaningful range, that\u00a0is, a range that can give rise to a functionally relevant population of the dimeric state, yet that allows for this population to be regulated by cellular factors."

The thumb and pointer helices adjacent to the catalytic HECT domain can mediate the dimerization of HUWE1. The dimer locks the position of the C-lobe, buries the C-terminal tail (magenta), and occludes a\u00a0putative ubiquitin binding site on the C-lobe of one subunit, hence representing an auto-inhibited state. Alternatively, the dimerization region of HUWE1 can associate with the activation segment in cis, which precludes dimer formation. The activation segment and the dimerization region are separated by a 55-residue linker that is presumably flexible, thus allowing for the re-positioning of the activation segment. In the monomeric state of HUWE1, the C-lobe is mobile with respect to the N-lobe\u00a0(arrow), and the C-terminal tail may anchor the C-lobe on the N-lobe or interact with substrates, as required for catalytic activity."

For instance, several point mutations that were identified in human tumors fall into the dimerization region and result in non-conservative amino acid changes of interfacing residues. We show that two of these sites, His 3962 and Ile 3969, are critical for dimerization and for the auto-inhibition of HUWE1. These observations are in\u00a0line with the notion that there may be selective pressure, at least in some human tumors, to enhance the activity of HUWE1 and to render it resistant to inhibition by p14ARF."

While the structure of the HUWE1 catalytic domain, by itself, has been previously reported, the importance of the current structure is that it reveals a unique regulatory mechanism for this enzyme, mediated by the domains upstream of the HECT domain. The protein is shown to form an asymmetric dimer is a manner that is predicted to inhibit the activity of the enzyme, and this is confirmed biochemically. Most interesting, p14ARF, a known HUWE1-interacting protein, is proposed to stabilize the dimeric (inhibited) form of HUWE1."

Second, the HUWE1 and p14ARF are cancer-relevant proteins, and while it is not yet clear which substrate(s) of HUWE1 are most critical in cancers, the proposed mechanism of regulation by ARF will be an important contribution and lay the groundwork for further discovery."

This implies that p14ARF, as well as the p14ARF peptide, binds to HUWE1 outside of the HECT domain, but this does not appear to have ever been tested, either here or in the literature. Given the reagents that the authors have in-hand, it seems that it would be very straight-forward to determine the binding site on HUWE1 for p14ARF. Finally, as stated in the Discussion, tumor-associated mutations have been identified in HUWE1 that fall within the dimerization domain. The prediction is that these mutations might result in hyper-activation of HUWE1 by inhibiting formation of the dimer.

Importantly, the <i>local</i> concentrations of HUWE1 at its cellular sites of action are expected to be significantly higher, due to the effects of cellular compartmentalization and protein co-localization (for a rationalization of this concept, see Pawson T &amp; Scott J S, Science 78(5346), 1997 or Kuriyan J &amp; Eisenberg D, Nature 450(7172), 2007). Considering the large size of HUWE1 (482 kDa) and, accordingly, the large number of its interaction partners, co-localization effects likely have a particularly pronounced impact on the local concentrations of HUWE1 and, therefore, on its propensity to dimerize (Ispolatov I et al., Nuc.

With the tumor suppressor p14ARF, intriguingly, we have identified one such macromolecular factor. We show that p14ARF interacts with the activation segment of HUWE1 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>; see also Point 5) and propose that this interaction shifts the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 towards the inhibited dimer (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>).

Unfortunately, it is problematic to test the above hypothesis in functional assays for the following reason: As noted by Hidde Ploegh and colleagues for HUWE1 (Pandya R K et al., J. Biol. Chem. 285(8), 2010), and in line with studies on other HECT E3 enzymes (e.g. Mari S. et al., Structure 22(11), 2014; Maspero E. et al., EMBO Rep. 12(4), 2011), the thioesterification of ubiquitin on the active site of HECT E3s is difficult to visualize, due to rapid isopeptide bond formation. To circumvent this problem, previous studies, including the one on HUWE1, have typically used truncated constructs of the HECT domain, in which the C-tail, including the conserved \u2018-4 Phe\u2019, was deleted or mutated. Such HECT constructs show impaired isopeptide bond formation with ubiquitin, while thioester formation is uncompromised, and thus allow for thioester formation to be monitored (Salvat C et al., J. Biol. Chem. 279(18), 2004). However, when studying the inhibitory mode of the HUWE1 dimer, we cannot make use of such an approach, since the C-tail of HUWE1 makes up an integral part of the dimer interface on molecule B in our structure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B-D</a>).
