However, current approaches are limited in their capacity to directly assign molecular identities to neurons. Here, we use serial multiplex immunogold labeling (siGOLD) and serial-section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) to identify multiple peptidergic neurons in a connectome. The high immunogenicity of neuropeptides and their broad distribution along axons, allowed us to identify distinct neurons by immunolabeling small subsets of sections within larger series. We demonstrate the scalability of siGOLD by using 11 neuropeptide antibodies on a full-body larval ssTEM dataset of the annelid <i>Platynereis</i>. We also reconstruct a peptidergic circuitry comprising the sensory nuchal organs, found by siGOLD to express pigment-dispersing factor, a circadian neuropeptide. Our approach enables the direct overlaying of chemical neuromodulatory maps onto synaptic connectomic maps in the study of nervous systems."

However, current approaches are limited in their capacity to directly assign molecular identities to neurons. Here, we use serial multiplex immunogold labeling (siGOLD) and serial-section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) to identify multiple peptidergic neurons in a connectome. The high immunogenicity of neuropeptides and their broad distribution along axons, allowed us to identify distinct neurons by immunolabeling small subsets of sections within larger series. We demonstrate the scalability of siGOLD by using 11 neuropeptide antibodies on a full-body larval ssTEM dataset of the annelid <i>Platynereis</i>. We also reconstruct a peptidergic circuitry comprising the sensory nuchal organs, found by siGOLD to express pigment-dispersing factor, a circadian neuropeptide. Our approach enables the direct overlaying of chemical neuromodulatory maps onto synaptic connectomic maps in the study of nervous systems."

The most powerful method that is currently available for tracing neurons and mapping the connections between them is called electron microscopy. This requires slicing brain tissue into ultrathin sections, which are then imaged one by one. However, while electron microscopy provides highly detailed information about the structure of the connections between neurons, it does not reveal which molecules the neurons use to communicate with each other."

Unlike previous approaches, siGOLD allows signal molecules inside cells to be labeled with protein tags called antibodies without compromising the ability to examine the tissue with electron microscopy. The technique was developed using the larvae of a marine worm called <i>Platynereis</i>. A single larva was sliced into 5000 sections thin enough to view under an electron microscope, and 150 of these were selected to represent the entire body. Because neurons are typically long and thin, individual neurons usually spanned multiple slices."

The antibodies were labeled with gold particles, which show up as black dots under the electron microscope. Because the molecules recognized by the antibodies are present all along the neuron, and because individual neurons extend over multiple slices, it was possible to trace single neurons by labeling only a small number of slices. Repeating this process in different subsets of slices with antibodies that bind to different signal molecules allowed entire neural circuits to be mapped."

Genetically encoded tags with enzymatic activity, such as miniSOG and APEX probes, allow the resolution of cells or subcellular structures by EM following incubation with a substrate that is converted to electron-dense deposits (<a href=\"#bib39\">Martell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Shu et al., 2011</a>). Fixation-resistant protein tags compatible with EM procedures and observable by correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) or directly by immunogold labeling (immunoEM), such as the smGFPs (<a href=\"#bib66\">Viswanathan et al., 2015</a>), have also been developed. In CLEM, fluorescently labeled neurons or organelles can be imaged live prior to fixation, sectioning, and EM imaging of the specimen. Fiducial markers allow the correlation of cellular structures in the immunofluorescence (IF) and EM images (<a href=\"#bib18\">Colombelli et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Maco et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Maco et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Urwyler et al., 2015</a>).

IF imaging can be combined with scanning EM imaging of selected sections to resolve ultrastructural detail. The sequentially acquired IF and EM images can be registered, allowing for correlative analysis of images of different modalities (<a href=\"#bib17\">Collman et al., 2015</a>). However, the sequential IF procedure compromises the membrane contrast in EM, preventing the reliable tracing of fine processes across series of sections (<a href=\"#bib17\">Collman et al., 2015</a>). Array tomography also relies on embedding the specimen in porous, hydrophilic acrylic resins to allow optimal immunolabeling. For large-scale serial sectioning projects, epoxy resins, such as Epon, are favored due to their higher stability during sectioning and imaging and the optimal ultrastructural preservation they provide (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bock et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Briggman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bumbarger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ohyama et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Randel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">White et al., 1986</a>).

In sections where we omitted the primary antibody, we did not see any gold labeling in any of the traced neurites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The VNC in our sample contained approximately 1600 neurite cross-sections and the majority of these showed no gold labeling. However, for each antibody we could identify a small number of neurites that consistently showed strong labeling across different sections (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). The pattern of the labeled neurites in the VNC showed bilateral symmetry, supporting the labeling of specific peptidergic neuron populations on the left and right sides of the body. Most neurites that were labeled on one grid were also strongly labeled on their grid pair with the same antibody separated by approximately 50 sections. There were some exceptions, for example neurite n5 that was labeled strongly with the FVamide antibody in layers 18\u201323 but not in layers 69\u201374 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). To determine whether the lack of labeling was due to the lack of DCVs in these sections, we scored the number of DCVs across all sections for selected neurites (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We found that DCVs were non-uniformly distributed in the neurites and some sections completely lacked DCVs. Importantly, we only detected gold labeling on sections that contained DCVs in the respective neurite (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>)."

The specificity of the MIP antibody was demonstrated previously (<a href=\"#bib68\">Williams et al., 2015</a>). We performed microinjections with 10 different translation-blocking morpholinos, one targeting each remaining proneuropeptide. We then performed triple IF in whole-mount 72 hpf larval samples using an acetylated tubulin antibody, a rat FVa antibody, and the respective rabbit neuropeptide antibodies. The acetylated tubulin antibody allowed us to exclude developmental abnormalities caused by morpholino injection. The rat FVa antibody provided a further control to exclude that morpholino injection affected proneuropeptide processing in general. For 8 out of 10 antibodies (FVa, FMRFa, ATO, FVRIa, PDF, RGWa, PENK, LEUC), morpholino injection strongly reduced IF signal with the respective antibody (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For the FMRFa antibody, we did not detect staining in the VNC following morpholino injection but we could still detect staining in the head. The FMRFa antibody therefore likely recognizes other antigens, such as other RFa peptides in the head (<a href=\"#bib21\">Conzelmann et al., 2013b</a>). For the RYa and LUQ antibodies, we did not see a reduction in staining intensity in the VNC following morpholino injection. These two antibodies may cross-react with other R[Y F]amide peptides as suggested by the labeling of an overlapping set of neurites with the FMRFa, LUQ, and RYa antibodies (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Without knowing the exact antigen specificity for these antibodies, we can nevertheless use them as specific markers of R[Y|F]amidergic neurons."

The arrangement of peptidergic axons in the VNC reconstructed by IF and image registration was similar to that of the VNC reconstructed by siGOLD (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013H</a>). To allow a more direct comparison of the spatial relationship of peptidergic axons, we performed double IF with each of the RGWa, PDF, and LEUC antibodies generated in rabbits in combination with a FVa antibody generated in rats. The spatial relationships of the neurites labeled with the RGWa, PDF, and LEUC antibodies relative to six prominent FVa neurites was very similar between IF and siGOLD (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I,J</a>). We could also detect the coexpression of FVa and PDF in some axons, both by double-IF and siGOLD. The high specificity of immunoEM, the reproducibility of labeling across sections, and the spatial correspondence of the labels between siGOLD and whole-mount IF indicate that we could accurately identify different peptidergic neurites in a serial EM dataset."

                                "text": "The whole-body serial EM dataset combined with siGOLD labeling allows the reconstruction of circuits of neurons with specific peptidergic identities. To demonstrate this, we focused on the nuchal organs in the <i>Platynereis</i> larval head as an example. The nuchal organ is a paired putative chemosensory organ in the annelid head with sensory neurons projecting a sensory dendrite into an olfactory pit. The olfactory pit is covered by cuticle and is associated with a patch of motile cilia (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib49\">Purschke, 2005</a>). We found that several sensory neurons of the nuchal organs (SN<sup>nuch</sup>) were strongly labeled by the PDF antibody in three different PDF-labeled sections in the head (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Of the 35 SN<sup>nuch</sup> cells we identified, 15 were labeled with the PDF antibody, with some of the neurons showing strong gold labeling in multiple sections (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). This is consistent with the labeling of the nuchal organ with the PDF antibody in IF (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). We traced all SN<sup>nuch</sup> neurons and identified their direct postsynaptic targets. We found that the most strongly connected neurons, receiving up to 22 synapses from SN<sup>nuch</sup> cells, were two pairs of interneurons (IN<sup>arc</sup>) with a unique biramous morphology and contralaterally projecting axons (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D\u2013F</a>; <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Two of the IN<sup>arc</sup> neurons were previously shown to be postsynaptic to the photoreceptor cells of the larval eyespots and have connections to the ventral motorneurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Randel et al., 2015</a>). This represents a potential functional path linking the nuchal organs to the locomotor apparatus. We also identified several other neurons that received a few synapses from the SN<sup>nuch</sup> cells, including two interneurons (IN<sup>RGWa-dcr1</sup>, IN<sup>RGWa-dcl1</sup>) that were identified by siGOLD labeling to express the RGWa neuropeptide (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>). Additionally, 87 neurons received only one synapse from one of the SN<sup>nuch</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The strong connectivity of the IN<sup>arc</sup> cells to the nuchal organ relative to these other neurons suggests that the IN<sup>arc</sup> cells represent the functionally relevant targets in the circuit."

First, neuropeptides are distributed along the entire length of axons, due to their active circulation throughout the axon (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wong et al., 2012</a>). Second, neuropeptide antigens have unique properties, including their small size, high abundance, concentration in DCVs, and frequent C-terminal amidation, a modification that confers increased stability and immunogenicity to mature neuropeptides (<a href=\"#bib19\">Conzelmann and J\u00e9kely, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Eipper et al., 1992</a>). In agreement with the extreme stability of neuropeptide immunoreactivity, we could perform immunoEM of \u2018set-aside\u2019 layers using neuropeptide antibodies years after sectioning and the acquisition of the complete image series had been completed."

Array tomography was developed to provide detailed molecular profiling of individual synapses, and uses repeated immunolabeling of every section. siGOLD does not rely on the staining of every section with multiple markers, but rather the staining of sparsely distributed sections with one marker each. The aim of siGOLD is to assign molecular tags to several different neurons and to trace them through many layers. Array tomography and CLEM involves the registration of separately acquired IF and EM images, and the relocation of the sample between the different imaging setups can be challenging and time consuming (<a href=\"#bib61\">Timmermans and Otto, 2015</a>). In contrast, siGOLD relies on the direct immunoEM labeling of sections and no registration step is needed. With siGOLD, we enjoy the full resolving power of the electron microscope, and in this study we could also identify individual DCVs that carry strong immunogold signal in the neurite profile of specific peptidergic neurons."

In <i>Platynereis</i>, as well as vertebrates, <i>C. elegans</i>, and <i>Drosophila</i>, the majority of mature neuropeptides are amidated (<a href=\"#bib33\">J\u00e9kely, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</a>), and several antibodies are available (e.g. (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johard et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">N\u00e4ssel, 1993</a>)) or could readily be generated. Some neuropeptide antibodies have already been shown to work with immunoEM. For example, PDF neuropeptide-containing neurons were identified in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain by immunoEM and their local synaptic inputs were reconstructed from a series of sections (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yasuyama and Meinertzhagen, 2010</a>). This and other antibodies could be used for siGOLD labeling in larger-scale connectome projects in <i>Drosophila</i>. Similar protocols and reagents could also be established for other organisms. siGOLD could also be adapted to organisms where transgenic tools to deliver EM-compatible markers are not available. In such organisms, the use of cross-species antibodies (<a href=\"#bib19\">Conzelmann and J\u00e9kely, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">N\u00e4ssel, 1993</a>) is a promising approach that would also allow the comparison of specific peptidergic neurons and their circuits across species."

This technique uses serial multiplex immunogold labeling (siGOLD) combined with standard serial-section transmission electron microscopy. Immunogold labeling for amidated neuropeptide epitopes, which show robust and long-term immunopreservation in Epon-embedded samples, is used, one marker per section, on sparsely distributed sections. Peptides provide unique markers because they are widely distributed in neurons including along the full lengths of axons. The advantage of siGOLD is that it relies on direct immunoEM of sections and does not rely on registering EM and IF images to assign immunolabels to specific structures. They use this technique to identify peptidergic neurons for eleven different neuropeptides in the CNS of 72 hpf <i>Platynereis</i> larva and they also reconstruct part of a sensory peptidergic circuit in the head of this larva."

We scored the number of dense core vesicles per slice in several axons in our test series (HT9-5). We found that the lack of consistent gold labeling of the same axon with the same antibody on grid pairs was always due either to the lack of vesicles in the non-labeled part of the axon, or the termination of the axon before the labeled sections. In these axons, we never found gold labeling in layers where the respective axons lacked dense-core vesicles. For example, n5 in layers 18-23 contains many dense-core vesicles, and labels strongly for cFVa, but it does not contain any vesicles in layers 69-74, and consistently lacks cFVa labeling. We could also demonstrate the non-uniform distribution of dense-core vesicles along peptidergic axons at the sub-micron scale. Despite this, a large number of sections contain dense-core vesicles meaning that the random selection of sections for gold labeling is a feasible approach with a high rate of success.

When the tiles are stitched together to generate the final layer, the tile with the best contrast was chosen, and the contrast was applied to all other tiles on the same layer using TrakEM2 (built-in commands such as: \"Adjust images \u2013 Enhance contrast layer-wise\" and \"Adjust images \u2013 Set min and max layer-wise\")."

Two expert neuroanatomists reviewed every neuron in the described circuit at least twice. Each synapse was visited at least four times, once from the presynaptic side and once from the postsynaptic site, by both tracers. All single-synapse connections have been confirmed. However, we do not know the functional significance of such singe-synapse connections. In the revised version we only show the main synaptic partners of the nuchal organs that receive many synaptic inputs (the IN<sup>arc</sup> interneurons). We have now included a figure (<a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) showing all postsynaptic partners of the nuchal organ sensory neurons. It is clear that there are several other targets that receive five or less synaptic inputs from the nuchal organs, with 87 cells receiving only one synapse. These are unlikely to be all functionally relevant connections."
