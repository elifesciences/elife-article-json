However, how the neural processing captures the most reliable cues is unknown. The interaural time difference (ITD) is the primary cue to localize sound in horizontal space. ITD is encoded in the firing rate of neurons that detect interaural phase difference (IPD). Due to the filtering effect of the head, IPD for a given location varies depending on the environmental context. We found that, in barn owls, at each location there is a frequency range where the head filtering yields the most reliable IPDs across contexts. Remarkably, the frequency tuning of space-specific neurons in the owl's midbrain varies with their preferred sound location, matching the range that carries the most reliable IPD. Thus, frequency tuning in the owl's space-specific neurons reflects a higher-order feature of the code that captures cue reliability."

For example, if two sounds of a similar pitch but from different locations are heard at the same time, they will add up at the ears and change the directional information. The group of neurons that respond to that range of pitches will be activated by both sounds so they cannot provide reliable information about the direction of the individual sounds. The degree to which the directional information is altered depends on the pitch that is being detected by the neurons; therefore detection of a different pitch within the sound may be a more reliable cue."

For example, the ability to see the world in three dimensions depends on cues that signal depth (<a href=\"#bib24\">Howard, 2012</a>). Similarly, sound localization, relies on auditory spatial cues including phase differences of sounds between the ears (<a href=\"#bib39\">Moiseff and Konishi, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Grothe et al., 2010</a>). Variability of sensory cues is intrinsic to the physics of stimuli and sensory organs. For instance, light and sound waves are reflected and absorbed differently by various media depending on wavelength and location (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carlile, 1996</a>). Multiple light and sound sources can also physically interfere with each other. In the auditory system, contexts such as whether the environment is reverberant, quiet or noisy can influence spatial cues greatly. The presence of concurrent sounds can shift auditory cues used for localizing a target sound (<a href=\"#bib28\">Keller and Takahashi, 2005</a>). This shift makes cues differ from what would be measured if the sound was emitted in a quiet environment. To be considered reliable, cues associated with a given location must be similar across different contexts. Unreliable cues, on the other hand, vary across contexts."

ITD is the difference in the arrival time of a sound at the ears. ITD results from unequal distances of a sound source to the two ears when the source is to the left or to the right of the listener. In barn owls, ITD is the main cue for localizing in the horizontal space (<a href=\"#bib39\">Moiseff and Konishi, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Moiseff, 1989</a>). ITD is initially detected by brainstem neurons tuned to narrow frequency bands in both mammals and birds (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carr and Konishi, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schnupp and Carr, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). These neurons compare the timing of inputs from the left and right sides of the brain (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carr and Konishi, 1990</a>). Due to the periodicity of sound signals when narrow frequency channels are considered, the shift in time between the left and right ears for each frequency component is more precisely expressed in terms of phase, referred to as the interaural phase difference (IPD). The spectrum of IPDs across frequency serves as a set of cues used for sound localization."

While ITD-selective neurons respond to a broad range of frequencies (here the black bold curve represents the neuron's combined response for frequencies F1, F2 and F3), their inputs are narrowly tuned to frequency (each input only responding to F1, F2 or F3). Because the inputs are narrowly tuned to frequency, the responses at each input vary with the phase difference between the left and right ears (IPD) of their preferred frequency, as shown by the sinusoidal curves. (<b>B</b>) A sound emitted by a single source (<b>B</b>, left) in front of the owl is filtered by the head and decomposed in narrow frequency channels by the cochlea. The localization cue corresponds to an IPD in each frequency channel (F1\u2013F3). In a different context (<b>B</b>, right), the target frontal sound (yellow) is emitted concurrently with another sound source from a different location (blue). The blue source interferes with the yellow target and shifts the resultant IPDs in each frequency channel (shown in green). Black dotted lines indicate IPD responses for the target frontal source alone, for comparison. While IPD shifts greatly for some frequencies (F1 and F3), in others (F2) IPD is more robust to the presence of another source. Thus in this example, F2 carries the most reliable IPD cue.

These studies focused on how the brain infers sound location from IPD without taking into account that IPD at a given sound location may vary between contexts in a frequency-dependent manner. In fact, a direct consequence of the filtering effect of the head is that the IPD induced by different acoustic objects varies in each frequency channel depending on context (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blauert, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Keller and Takahashi, 2005</a>). For example, the phase of a target sound can be shifted by the presence of a concurrent sound and the amount of phase shift is frequency dependent (<a href=\"#bib28\">Keller and Takahashi, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Thus, for a given location of a sound source, the IPD cue may vary in a frequency-dependent manner in the presence of another sound. In other words, IPD may not be equally reliable as a sound localization cue at every frequency band.

For sound localization based on IPD, this would mean that those frequencies that elicit more reliable IPD (i.e., where the variability of IPD is small) at a given location across different contexts should be favored in the process of estimating this particular location. We will refer to this mechanism as <i>weighting by reliability</i>. To test whether weighting by reliability occurs in sound localization, one can examine populations of neurons that integrate localization cues. A neural representation of auditory space emerges in the barn owl's external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx). Thus, the barn owl's ICx provides an opportunity to test whether weighting by reliability is used to map sound location from variable cues."

Single unit recordings were validated by spike sorting software (<a href=\"#bib43\">Quiroga et al., 2004</a>) in 99 of the 138 recordings sites, whereas in 39 recording sites spike sorting separated two different units. Therefore, while the majority of recordings consisted of single units, some of them yielded two units. ITD and frequency tuning were measured for each neuron. We estimated best ITD from the peak of the rate-ITD tuning curve (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, top row) and the best frequency (BF) from the center of the rate-frequency tuning curve (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, bottom row). The neurons' best ITD is correlated with the preferred azimuth in the map of auditory space of the owl's ICx (<a href=\"#bib39\">Moiseff and Konishi, 1983</a>). To achieve a representative assessment of the neural population, we recorded responses of ICx neurons with best ITDs spread over the entire map. Best ITD varied from 0 to 249 \u00b5s and BF varied from 920 Hz to 6168 Hz. To the best of our knowledge, neurons tuned to such large ITDs or low BFs have not been reported in the owl's ICx (<a href=\"#bib42\">Perez and Pena, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wagner et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Vonderschen and Wagner, 2009</a>).

Neurons preferring small ITDs were tuned to higher frequencies and, conversely, those preferring large ITDs were tuned to lower frequencies. The strong correlation between best ITD and BF was not affected whether the analysis was performed using recording sites with a single unit (n = 99, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001), pooled recordings of single and multi-units (n = 138, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.72, p &lt; 0.001) or all sorted single units (n = 177, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.75, p &lt; 0.001).

In barn owls, which lack a pinna, the facial ruff and ear canal act as filters (<a href=\"#bib27\">Keller et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">von Campenhausen and Wagner, 2006</a>) embodied in the head-related transfer functions (HRTFs; <a href=\"#bib27\">Keller et al., 1998</a>). These filters change both the phase and the magnitude of each frequency component of the sound in a location-dependent manner. When sounds are coming from multiple sources, the sound waves from each source will add in the ears and alter binaural cues. As described in <a href=\"#bib28\">Keller and Takahashi (2005)</a>, the binaural cues resulting from the mixture of multiple sound sources are dictated by the relative intensity of each source within each frequency band. If two sources emitting sounds at the same intensity differ in the IPD within a frequency band, the resultant IPD is the average of the IPDs from the individual sources. When a target source carries more power in a particular frequency band, the resulting IPD will shift closer to this source. If the power of the second source is larger at a given frequency band, the IPD at this band is drawn away from the target source. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> shows an example of the relative variation in IPD around the mean IPD caused by the presence of concurrent sources. In this example the IPDs generated by one source located at 5\u00b0 of azimuth and 0\u00b0 of elevation (black dots) is contrasted with IPDs obtained when a second source, also at 0\u00b0 elevation, is added at azimuths ranging between \u221290 and 90\u00b0 (grey dots). For this azimuthal location, IPD variability induced by a second source is greatest between 3 and 4 kHz."

Thus, in addition to the shift in IPD, the presence of concurrent sounds could modulate the firing rate of ICx neurons by changing interaural correlation. To test whether the IPD reliability is consistent with the pattern of interaural correlation induced by concurrent sounds, we examined the mean interaural correlation at the ITD of the target source within each frequency channel while concurrent sounds from other locations were presented. We found that the pattern of interaural correlation as a function of frequency and location was very similar to the IPD reliability (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.81, p &lt; 0.001).

To investigate whether reliability of IPD or simply sound level was more important in driving the tuning of ICx neurons, we asked whether frequency tuning was better predicted by IPD reliability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) or by the gain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Gain and IPD reliability patterns displayed similarities, as expected from the fundamental relationship between the interaction of concurrent sound sources and their gain (<a href=\"#bib28\">Keller and Takahashi, 2005</a>); IPD at locations with lower gain is more susceptible to variation in the presence of other sounds than is IPD at locations with higher gain. Additionally, correlation between IPD reliability and gain may also arise from common causes of variation such as acoustic reflections at the facial ruff (<a href=\"#bib51\">von Campenhausen and Wagner, 2006</a>). However, the frequency tuning of neurons did not match the gain pattern as well as it matched the IPD reliability as a function of frequency at the best ITD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). We computed the correlation coefficients between the frequency tuning curves and both the IPD reliability and gain as a function of frequency at the best ITD of each neuron.

At low frequencies, the owl's facial ruff has a relatively small location-dependent effect on sound level (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hausmann et al., 2010</a>). Thus, the relative gain of high and low frequencies at different locations could provide a cue for stimulus location. To test whether the relative gain of each frequency could predict the ITD tuning, we normalized the gain across locations for each frequency separately before normalizing the gain across frequency for each location (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Once again, the results for the gain did not correlate with the experimental frequency tuning as well as the IPD reliability did (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>, p &lt; 0.001 Wilcoxon rank-sum test).

ICCc is located earlier in the pathway leading to ICx and contains ITD-sensitive neurons that are narrowly tuned to frequency (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wagner et al., 2002</a>). While ITD tuning varies with frequency in ICx, such dependence is not observed in ICCc (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wagner et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">2007</a>). Thus, recording in ICCc allowed us to assess sensory-input variability before frequency convergence occurs. Because the predictions due to reliability or to gain differed most between high and low frequencies in frontal locations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B,D</a>), we explored this range in ICCc using concurrent sounds. We measured the spatial tuning of ICCc cells using single sources and while another sound was presented from different locations covering the frontal hemisphere on the horizontal plane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). To quantify the effect of concurrent sounds in altering the spatial tuning of ICCc cells, we cross-correlated the spatial tuning curves obtained with single sources with those measured with concurrent sounds (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We found that the spatial tuning of ICCc cells tuned to the front (preferred location between 5 and 20\u00b0) was more affected by the presence of another sound, that is, more variable, at lower than at higher frequencies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.6, p &lt; 0.001). Experiments were performed in a high quality anechoic chamber (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), thus we consider it unlikely that the variability in spatial tuning of low frequency ICCc neurons is due to room reflections. Therefore the data from ICCc neurons confirm our prediction that the variability induced by the HRTFs is carried over the sound localization pathway."

To assess the frequency dependence of neural noise we computed the Fano factors, a measure of trial-to-trial response variability, for ITD tuning curves obtained with tonal stimulation. We measured ITD tuning curves using tones from 1 to 7 kHz in 70 ICx cells (total of 342 curves). If neural noise were correlated with frequency, Fano factors should vary with stimulus frequency. We found that the Fano factors spread around 1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, median = 1.06) and were negligibly correlated with the stimulus frequency (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.1, p = 0.03). We also assessed whether neural noise is frequency-dependent when examined at different locations. We split the neurons into 4 groups according to their best ITDs (0\u201350 \u00b5s; 50\u2013100 \u00b5s; 100\u2013150 \u00b5s; larger than 150 \u00b5s). For each group we averaged the Fano factors of the different neurons across the same stimulating frequency. We found no relationship between the Fano factor and frequency as a function of best ITD in the first 3 groups (Group1: r<sup>2</sup> =\u22120.08, p = 0.68; Group2: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.007, p = 0.92; Group3: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.1, p = 0.62). For best ITDs larger than 150 \u00b5s, the Fano factor decreased as frequency increased (r<sup>2</sup> =\u22120.7, p &lt; 0.001). However, if neural noise drove the low-pass frequency tuning at eccentric locations, the opposite relationship would be expected (higher frequencies noisier than lower frequencies). Thus, frequency-dependent trial-to-trial variability in neural responses cannot explain the correlation between best ITD and frequency tuning."

In the same dataset used to assess the Fano factor (n = 342), ITD curves were folded into IPD curves (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The response at each IPD was treated as a vector with direction given by the IPD and length given by the mean firing rate at that IPD. The synchronization coefficient was the amplitude of the mean IPD vector divided by the sum of the mean firing rates for the entire period. Coefficients decreased minimally with frequency (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.14, p &lt; 0.001) below 7 kHz. In sum, we found no evidence consistent with neural noise explaining the frequency-dependent ITD tuning. Thus, context dependence of the auditory cues resulting from the filtering properties of the HRTFs appeared to be the main source of location-dependent variability and the primary mechanism to adjust tonotopy along with spatial tuning."

Thus, the frequency tuning in the space-specific neurons of ICx is not simply due to tonotopy inherited from upstream neurons, but rather reflects a higher-order aspect of the neural code that may contribute to a more robust representation of sound location.

This means that at each frequency, preferred ITDs are limited to a narrow part of the natural range. This is in stark contrast to the broad distribution of best ITDs across frequency reported in the upstream nucleus ICCc (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wagner et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">2007</a>). Evidence for best ITDs covering the natural range in nucleus laminaris (NL) comes from studies of neurophonic potentials (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sullivan and Konishi, 1986</a>) and axonal delays of input fibers to NL (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carr and Konishi, 1990</a>). However, recent studies show that the methodology relying on the neurophonic to estimate the best ITDs of actual neurons, as opposed to the compound field potential from input fibers, may lead to spurious conclusions (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mc Laughlin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kuokkanen et al., 2013</a>).

When the device shifted the ITD by more than 50 \u00b5s, the ITD tuning of neurons also shifted by more than 50 \u00b5s compared to control owls.

The model of Harper and McAlpine (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harper and McAlpine, 2004</a>) proposes that the optimal distribution of preferred IPDs at each frequency will maximize the information that the population provides about IPD. In this framework, the optimal distribution of preferred IPDs at each frequency depends on the statistical distribution of IPD from the environment. This theory predicts that preferred IPDs should cover the natural range of IPD at each frequency that is relevant for sound localization in the owl. Harper and McAlpine took into account the statistics of the human acoustic cue to predict the optimal relationship between best IPD and frequency in humans. However, their predictions about the optimal neural code in the owl used a distribution of IPD that depends only on head size, and not on the IPD distribution occurring in natural environments. While this optimal coding model suggests that the distribution of IPD in natural environments may be an important factor influencing the neural code for sound localization, the model only addresses the representation of IPD at each frequency, and does not address how sound localization cues should be integrated over frequency to produce spatially selective auditory neurons. Here, we show that in the owl, spatial dependence of frequency tuning can be explained by a code that captures the range of frequency that carries the most reliable IPD. This study sheds light on an outstanding question in sound localization: Do neurons match the pattern of IPD across frequency experienced by each species? Our results suggest that neurons are tuned to the frequency range within which IPD varies least for each location over different environmental conditions. Thus, rather than neurons matching the IPD spectrum over the audible frequency range (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brainard et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Goodman et al., 2013</a>), they exclude ranges where the cue is most unreliable."

Pearson correlation coefficients were used to compare the smoothed frequency tuning curves with the estimated frequency from the IPD reliability and gain. The Pearson correlation coefficients of the spatial tuning curves obtained with single sources and those measured with concurrent sounds were averaged to quantify the overall effect of concurrent sounds in altering the spatial tuning of ICCc cells."

The gain of the loudspeaker used by <a href=\"#bib27\">Keller et al., 1998</a> decreased sharply below about 2 kHz. In the present study, the HRTFs were reprocessed by Dr Keller, equalizing the gain of the loudspeaker down to 1 kHz. As in the original paper, in order to remove the effects of the loudspeaker, an inverse filter for the loudspeaker was constructed and convolved with the head-related impulse responses. The new inverse filter, now optimized to include frequencies down to 1 kHz, removes most of the effects of the loudspeaker. To align HRTFs across owls, IPD variability was computed at an elevation centered between the acoustic axes of left and right ear-canals (the locations of maximum intensity gain of the HRTFs for left and right ears). This accounts for slight differences in head placement of each owl that might lead to differences in the definition of zero elevation across owls. We calculated the left and right acoustic axes by taking the median gain across the different frequencies and determined the center of gravity of the top 90% elevations."

The outputs were passed through a gammatone filter-bank with center frequencies ranging from 1 kHz to 8 kHz in 0.2 kHz steps. The time constants of the filters were specific to the owl and estimated from <a href=\"#bib32\">Koppl (1997a)</a> to model cochlear filters, as described in <a href=\"#bib15\">Fischer et al. (2009)</a>. Because variability was estimated within narrow frequency bands, we used IPD, rather than ITD, by converting time into phase. The IPD in narrow frequency channels was calculated as the phase delay with the highest value of the cross-correlation between the left and right outputs of the gammatone filter. For each target location, we obtained 37 estimates of IPD, each with a second source located at one of the locations covering the frontal hemisphere (between \u221290 and 90\u00b0 in steps of 5\u00b0 at elevation zero). The circular standard deviation of IPD over locations of the second sound source was used as the estimate of IPD variability at each location."

The outputs were passed through a gammatone filter-bank with center frequencies ranging from 1 kHz to 8 kHz in 0.2 kHz steps as described above. The cross-correlation was computed within each frequency channel. For a single sound source the interaural correlation was close to 1 and decreased when a concurrent sound was added. The interaural correlations with concurrent sounds were averaged across different locations of concurrent sounds."

Interaural time difference (ITD) is the primary cue to localize sound in horizontal space in these birds. ITD is encoded in the firing rate of neurons that detect interaural phase difference (IPD) in nucleus ICx. In these birds IPD is influenced by the filtering properties of the facial mask so that IPD is most reliable for a particular frequency band at a particular location. They show that frequency tuning is such that IPD is most reliable at each preferred location (IPD). These findings have very important implications for how sensory circuits are constructed to capture stimulus reliability. This paper should provoke wide interest among the readers of <i>eLife</i>."

First off, it is not clear how they compute IPD. Authors state \u201cthe IPD of the gammatone filter outputs...\u201d Normally one would cross-correlate the left and right filter outputs, then define the IPD as the phase delay with the highest correlation value (i.e., peak IPD). I assume that is how the authors compute it. But it is already known that this peak IPD will be midway between sources, as they cited from the Keller &amp; Takahashi paper. The firing rates of ICx neurons aren't sensitive to the location of the peak IPD, they're sensitive to the interaural correlation at the best ITD (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albeck &amp; Konishi 1995</a>). The addition of a concurrent source will decrease the interaural correlation, which is the value that is actually modulating the neural response. Interaural correlation at a specified IPD can be interpreted as IPD reliability; single sources will yield interaural correlation values near 1, while those for concurrent sources will be lower. It seems that analyzing IPD reliability as correlation is more directly relatable to the firing of ICx neurons. The problem with only looking at IPD peaks is that they could have little spread, which in this paper's analysis would suggest good IPD reliability, but yet have quite low correlation values, so actually not reliable cues."

Although the authors attempt to present their results clearly, it was necessary to re-read sections and go back-and-forth several times to understand the set-up and the arguments. The overall flow and organization of both the text and the figures can be significantly improved. We strongly suggest that the authors revamp their manuscript by expanding the introduction, lay out the problem much more clearly in the introduction, clearly define and explain all the terms used, lay out more clearly the logic of their arguments, expand the figure legends, and re-organize figure panels. If done, the paper will be more widely accessible, and a broader audience, more than just researchers who work in auditory coding, will be able to appreciate these very interesting results."

We were simply suggesting that they try defining IPD reliability as the average interaural correlation across contexts (evaluated from the cross-correlation function at the IPD of the target source), instead of the inverse of the variance of peak IPD across contexts. You could then compare frequency tuning to a heat map of this interaural correlation-based IPD reliability, similar to the other cases in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. We don't believe their new interaural correlation analysis is useful. You take interaural correlation functions from each frequency channel, normalize them, average them across channels (weighted or unweighted), then define the peak of this average function as the interaural correlation. The averaging of correlation functions is questionable, and defining interaural correlation as the peak of this function instead of the value at the IPD of the target source seems incorrect."

We do not wish to delay the publication of this paper unnecessarily so we offer two options for revision. First option: Since the results with peak IPD are strong on their own, you could simply delete the newly-added section on interaural correlation in the Results and Methods and eliminate the two sentences in the Discussion pertaining to it. Second option: Perform the analysis detailed above and include that analysis in the paper to make even a strong case in support of your hypothesis."

Of these 138 recordings, 99 were validated as single units and 39 as multi-unit. The reason why the number of units increased from 138 to 177 is because we used all the single units that the spike sorting analysis produced, which in 39 out of 138 recordings was more than one. In the first submission we had combined single and multi-unit data (n=138) because it is assumed that neighboring neurons in ICx have very similar tuning. When units are considered well-isolated by the software we now include them in the analysis. We do not find a scientific justification to select one over another unit in the same recording, once the software classifies them as putative single units.
