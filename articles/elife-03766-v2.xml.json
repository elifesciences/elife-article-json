                    "text": "Chitin is a fungal microbe-associated molecular pattern recognized in <i>Arabidopsis</i> by a lysin motif receptor kinase (LYK), AtCERK1. Previous research suggested that AtCERK1 is the major chitin receptor and mediates chitin-induced signaling through homodimerization and phosphorylation. However, the reported chitin binding affinity of AtCERK1 is quite low, suggesting another receptor with high chitin binding affinity might be present. Here, we propose that AtLYK5 is the primary chitin receptor in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Mutations in AtLYK5 resulted in a significant reduction in chitin response. However, AtLYK5 shares overlapping function with AtLYK4 and, therefore, <i>Atlyk4/Atlyk5-2</i> double mutants show a complete loss of chitin response. AtLYK5 interacts with AtCERK1 in a chitin-dependent manner. Chitin binding to AtLYK5 is indispensable for chitin-induced AtCERK1 phosphorylation. AtLYK5 binds chitin at a much higher affinity than AtCERK1. The data suggest that AtLYK5 is the primary receptor for chitin, forming a chitin inducible complex with AtCERK1 to induce plant immunity."

                    "text": "Chitin is a fungal microbe-associated molecular pattern recognized in <i>Arabidopsis</i> by a lysin motif receptor kinase (LYK), AtCERK1. Previous research suggested that AtCERK1 is the major chitin receptor and mediates chitin-induced signaling through homodimerization and phosphorylation. However, the reported chitin binding affinity of AtCERK1 is quite low, suggesting another receptor with high chitin binding affinity might be present. Here, we propose that AtLYK5 is the primary chitin receptor in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Mutations in AtLYK5 resulted in a significant reduction in chitin response. However, AtLYK5 shares overlapping function with AtLYK4 and, therefore, <i>Atlyk4/Atlyk5-2</i> double mutants show a complete loss of chitin response. AtLYK5 interacts with AtCERK1 in a chitin-dependent manner. Chitin binding to AtLYK5 is indispensable for chitin-induced AtCERK1 phosphorylation. AtLYK5 binds chitin at a much higher affinity than AtCERK1. The data suggest that AtLYK5 is the primary receptor for chitin, forming a chitin inducible complex with AtCERK1 to induce plant immunity."

Pathogen perception in plants can be divided into two different layers (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jones and Dangl, 2006</a>). The initial response, mediated by perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), is termed MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boller and Felix, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Macho and Zipfel, 2014</a>). MTI is characterized by a wide range of physiological responses, including production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, calcium influx, ion channel activation, callose deposition, growth inhibition, and expression of defense-related genes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Macho and Zipfel, 2014</a>). However, adapted pathogens can inhibit MTI through the secretion of specific effector proteins or small RNAs into the cell (<a href=\"#bib62\">Weiberg et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2014</a>). In response, plants have evolved polymorphic nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) proteins that either directly or indirectly recognize these effectors; thereby, restoring plant immunity. This form of immunity is termed effector-triggered immunity (ETI) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bent and Mackey, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Boller and Felix, 2009</a>). Compared to MTI, ETI is much stronger and often associated with a hypersensitive response (HR), which involves programmed cell death (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jones and Dangl, 2006</a>)."

                        "text": "Plants use cell-surface localized pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect MAMPs activating MTI (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boller and Felix, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Macho and Zipfel, 2014</a>). In plants, several PRRs have been well characterized, including FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) and elongation factor-TU (EF-Tu) RECEPTOR (EFR), which detect bacterial flagellin and EF-Tu, respectively (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gomez-Gomez and Boller, 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zipfel et al., 2006</a>). These two receptors belong to the leucine rich repeat receptor like protein kinase (LRR-RLK) family (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shiu and Bleecker, 2001</a>). Activation of these receptors by ligand binding induces the association with BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1)- Associated receptor Kinase 1 (BAK1) and phosphorylation of Botrytis-Induced Kinase (BIK1) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chinchilla et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heese et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Roux et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>). Phosphorylated BIK1 dissociates from the receptor and subsequently phosphorylates the respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (RBOHD) protein, which controls ROS production in a calcium-independent manner (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kadota et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2014</a>). Other MAMPs, such as the oligosaccharides bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and fungal chitin [degree of polymerization (dp) \u2265 6], are detected by lysin-motif (LysM) containing proteins. The chitin receptor was first reported in rice with the identification of the chitin-elicitor binding protein (CEBiP) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kaku et al., 2006</a>), which contains an extracellular LysM motif and a transmembrane domain, but lacks an intracellular kinase domain. Data indicate that CEBiP forms a complex with the rice chitin-elicitor receptor kinase 1 (OsCERK1) to mediate MTI in response to chitin (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hayafune et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Shimizu et al., 2010</a>). OsCERK1 has an active, intracellular kinase domain. The data suggest that OsCERK1 does not bind chitin but its intracellular kinase domain is activated by chitin binding to OsCEBiP (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hayafune et al., 2014</a>). In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, AtCERK1 was shown to be a key chitin receptor involved in chitin perception (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miya et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wan et al., 2008</a>). For example, <i>Atcerk1</i> mutant plants completely lose the ability to respond to chitin elicitation. There are three homologs of CEBiP in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, but a triple knock-out mutant, <i>Atlym1/Atlym2/Atlym3</i> lacking these three proteins was fully competent to respond to chitin treatment (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wan et al., 2012</a>). However, two CEBiP like proteins appear to function in conjunction with CERK1 to mediate recognition of bacterial PGN (OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 in rice, AtLYM1 and AtLYM3 in <i>Arabidopsis</i>) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Willmann et al., 2011</a>). Another CEBiP-like protein, AtLYM2, was demonstrated to act independently of AtCERK1 to mediate chitin-induced suppression of intracellular flux through plasmodesmata (<a href=\"#bib12\">Faulkner et al., 2013</a>)."

AtCERK1 was reported as the primary chitin receptor based on the mutant phenotype (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miya et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wan et al., 2008</a>) but also the fact that the protein can be precipitated by binding to chitin beads (<a href=\"#bib19\">Iizasa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Petutschnig et al., 2010</a>). The X-ray crystal structure of the ectodomain of AtCERK1 was solved by <a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al. (2012b)</a>. The structure predicted interaction of chitin oligomers with the second LysM motif in the extracellular domain. These authors suggested a model by which long chain chitin oligomers (dp \u2265 6) bound to the LysM domains on two monomers, resulting in homodimerization of AtCERK1. This dimerization was shown to activate the intracellular kinase domain (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Petutschnig et al., 2010</a>). However, there remains the possibility that, similar to the situation in rice, the active chitin receptor is composed of more than one protein. For example, mutations in <i>AtLYK4</i> were shown to significantly reduce the plant response to chitin (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wan et al., 2012</a>), although the phenotype was not as pronounced as that of <i>Atcerk1</i> mutant plants. While the X-ray crystal structure of the ectodomain of AtCERK1 provided evidence that it is indeed a chitin binding protein, a puzzling aspect of this work is the low binding affinity (chitooctaose, K<sub>d</sub> = 45 \u00b5M) reported, based on calorimetry (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2012b</a>). Another puzzling aspect is that mutations in AtCERK1, predicted to block chitin binding (AtCERK1<sup>A138H</sup>), did not block chitin-induced AtCERK1<sup>A138H</sup> phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2012b</a>).

                                "text": "<i>Arabidopsis</i> has five LysM receptor kinases (LYKs) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, plants mutated in each of these genes were tested for their ability to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to chitin elicitation. As expected from previous publications, mutations in <i>AtCERK1</i> showed strongly reduced ROS production (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miya et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wan et al., 2008</a>), while mutations in <i>AtLYK4</i> also showed a slight reduction in ROS production upon chitin elicitation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wan et al., 2012</a>). In previous publications, which involved screening <i>Atlyk1-5</i> mutants, we reported that a transposon insertion in <i>AtLYK5</i> did not affect chitin-induced MTI (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wan et al, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">2012</a>). This conclusion was based on measuring <i>AtWRKY53</i> expression upon chitin addition<i>.</i> At the time of these studies, the only <i>Atlyk5</i> mutant available was in the Lansberg (Ler) background (<i>Atlyk5-1</i>). As part of a new round of screening, we again examined the chitin response of <i>Atlyk5-1</i> mutant plants. qRT-PCR analysis showed that chitin treatment induced similar expression of <i>AtWRKY53</i> in both Ler wild-type and <i>Atlyk5-1</i> mutant plants (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>); data consistent with the previously published results (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wan, et al, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">2012</a>). However, in contrast to these results, the expression of <i>AtWRKY33</i> 15 min after chitin treatment was significantly reduced in <i>Atlyk5-1</i> mutant plants relative to Ler wild-type plants (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Chitin-triggered MAP kinase (MPK) phosphorylation was also significantly reduced in <i>Atlyk5-1</i> mutant plants compared with Ler wild-type plants (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The phosphorylated AtCERK1 triggered by chitin elicitation can be detected as a band shift based on immunoblots using anti-AtCERK1 antibody (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Petutschnig et al., 2010</a>). Chitin-triggered AtCERK1 phosphorylation was detected in Ler wild-type plants but was reduced in <i>Atlyk5-1</i> mutant plants (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In general, based on chitin-triggered ROS production, Ler wild-type plants showed a lower response to chitin than Col-0 plants, while <i>Atlyk5-1</i> mutant plants showed similar ROS production to the wild-type when treated with chitin (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Taken together, these experiments suggested that our original conclusion concerning AtLYK5 may not be correct; that is, this protein may be involved in chitin response. What is clear is that the <i>Atlyk5-1</i> mutant, with a transposon insertion in the 3\u2032 region of the gene, does not exhibit a strong phenotype under all conditions. The analysis of the chitin response in the Ler ecotype is further complicated by the generally weak response to chitin elicitation."

                                "text": "Given these concerns, we identified and characterized a Col-0 <i>Atlyk5</i> mutant (<i>Atlyk5-2</i>) from the SALK population (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This line has a T-DNA in the extracellular domain of AtLYK5 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). It should be noted that in our original publications (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wan et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">2012</a>), all of the <i>Atlyk</i> mutants, with the exception of <i>Atlyk5-1</i>, were derived from the Col-0 ecotype. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, chitin-induced ROS production was significantly lower in the <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant plants compared to Col-O wild-type plants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Calcium influx is activated by exposure of wild-type plants to chitin. Similar treatment of <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant plants showed a 90% reduction and a significant delay in the calcium response, while <i>Atcerk1</i> mutant plants showed essentially no calcium response to chitin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Flagellin-triggered calcium influx in both <i>Atcerk1</i> and <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant plants were similar to Col-0 wild-type plants (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), indicating that these defects were specific to chitin and not to a general effect on MTI. MPK3 and MPK6 are specifically phosphorylated upon chitin elicitation in Col-0 wild-type but not in <i>Atcerk1</i> mutant plants. Significant reduction in MPK phosphorylation was detected in <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant plants after chitin treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Consistent with these findings, the <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant plants showed an intermediate response with regard to chitin-induced <i>AtWRKY29, AtWRKY30, AtWRKY33,</i> and <i>AtWRKY53</i> expression compared to the Col-0 wild-type and the <i>Atcerk1</i> mutant plants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Both <i>Atcerk1</i> and <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant plants showed increased susceptibility to the fungal pathogen <i>Alternaria brassicicola</i> compared with Col-0 wild-type plants. Pretreatment with chitooctaose enhanced resistance to <i>A. brassicicola</i> in wild-type plants but not in <i>Atcerk1</i> or <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant plants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Untreated <i>Atcerk1</i> and <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant plants showed wild-type levels of resistance to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. tomato DC3000. However, only the wild-type showed increased bacterial resistance when plants were pretreated with chitooctaose to induce MTI (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). In order to confirm that the loss of chitin response was due to the <i>AtLYK5</i> mutation, transgenic plants expressing the full-length <i>AtLYK5</i> gene were generated under control of its native promoter in the <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant genetic background (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Expression of AtLYK5 in <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant plants complemented all of the chitin-induced responses, including ROS production and MAPK phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data indicate that AtLYK5 is essential for a strong response to chitin elicitation. The response of all five <i>Atlyk</i> mutant plants was tested based on chitin-induced ROS prodction (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), confirming that AtCERK1, AtLYK4 and AtLYK5, but not AtLYK2 or AtLYK3 are involved in chitin signaling."

Previously, we reported that AtLYK4 is also required for chitin elicitation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wan et al., 2012</a>). Phylogenetic analysis shows that AtLYK5 and AtLYK4 are in the same branch (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, we examined the possibility that AtLYK4 may provide some functional redundancy for the loss of AtLYK5; thus, explaining the low level response of the <i>Atlyk5</i> mutants to chitin. To address this hypothesis, mutant plants defective in both AtLYK4 and AtLYK5 were generated through crossing (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and tested for their response to chitin. Similar to the <i>Atcerk1</i> mutants, plants mutated in AtLYK4 and AtLYK5 lost all tested responses to chitin, including ROS production and MAPK phosphorylation, as well as resistance to the fungal pathogen <i>A. brassicicola</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). These genetic studies suggest that AtLYK5 and AtCERK1 are essential for a strong plant chitin response, while AtLYK4 can partially compensate for the loss of AtLYK5."

However, AtCERK1 appears to be a very weak chitin binding protein raising questions as to the biological relevance of the AtCERK1 homodimer model. Therefore, in order to predict the chitin binding site(s) within the AtLYK5 extracellular domain, a computational model of the AtLYK5 ectodomain was built by homology modeling against the known crystal structure of the fungal ECP6 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sanchez-Vallet et al., 2013</a>), a LysM effector protein, which binds chitin with very high affinity (binding at pM levels; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Based on the docking model of AtLYK5 with chitooctaose, the binding affinity was calculated at \u22128.9 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), a value comparable to the computational binding affinity of ECP6 (\u22129.0 kcal mol<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Four residues, that is, Thr-72, Tyr-128, Ser-206, and Ser-216, were predicted to form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with chitooctaose based on docking model (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Point mutations were introduced at each of these residues and transgenically expressed in <i>Atlyk5</i> mutant plants from the native promoter. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <i>AtLYK5</i><sup><i>S206P</i></sup> and <i>AtLYK5</i><sup><i>Y128G</i></sup> transgenic plants could not rescue the <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant phenotype as measured by chitin-triggered ROS production. In contrast, expression of AtLYK5<sup>T72G</sup> and AtLYK5<sup>S216P</sup> mutant proteins in the <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant plants did restore the chitin response. Consistent with these results, AtLYK5<sup>S206P</sup> mutant proteins did not bind to chitin beads, while AtLYK5<sup>Y128G</sup> mutant proteins showed a strong reduction in chitin binding using this same assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Binding of the AtLYK5<sup>T72G</sup> and AtLYK5<sup>S216P</sup> mutant proteins to the chitin beads was similar to wild-type AtLYK5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These data indicate that residues Tyr-128 and Ser-206 of AtLYK5 are important for chitin binding and that chitin binding is essential for biological activity."

Chitin-induced association between AtLYK5 and AtCERK1 was much stronger than homodimerization of AtCERK1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We also tested the chemical specificity of this response using chitin oligomers of increasing length (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Chitopentaose which can not trigger immune responses in plants did not induce AtLYK5-CERK1 association, while chitin oligomers (dp \u2265 6), which are strong elicitors, induced the interaction between AtLYK5 and AtCERK1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

The analysis showed that several residues generally considered essential for kinase activity are missing from the AtLYK5 sequence (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), including those in the P-loop sub-domain I, RD domain in sub-domain VIa, and DFG domain in sub-domain VII (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that AtLYK5 lacks kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hanks et al., 1988</a>). In order to test this directly, the AtLYK5 kinase domain was expressed and purified from <i>Escherichia coli</i> and used in an in vitro kinase assay. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, as a positive control, the AtCERK1 kinase domain showed strong kinase activity as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miya et al., 2007</a>), while no kinase activity was detected using the AtLYK5 kinase domain. In order to investigate the role of AtLYK5 kinase activity in vivo, wild-type AtLYK5, a mutant AtLYK5<sup>K395E</sup> (mutation of Lys to Glu predicted to disrupt ATP binding ability), and mutant AtLYK5<sup>\u0394KD</sup> (deletion of kinase domain) proteins were transgenically expressed in <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant plants from the native promoter (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The data show that expression of AtLYK5 or AtLYK5<sup>K395E</sup> could complement the <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant phenotype, as measured by chitin-triggered ROS production, MAPK phosphorylation, and AtCERK1 phosphorylation, whereas transgenic expression of AtLYK5<sup>\u0394KD</sup> did not complement the <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013E</a>). These results indicate that although AtLYK5 kinase activity is not required for chitin signaling, the intracellular kinase does have a function, which may include mediating protein\u2013protein interactions. Indeed, the AtLYK5<sup>\u0394KD</sup> mutant protein could not be co-immunoprecipitated with AtCERK1 after chitin treatment, while AtCERK1 interacted with AtLYK5<sup>K395E</sup> and wild-type AtLYK5 normally (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). These data strongly demonstrate that the kinase domain of AtLYK5 is necessary for the association of AtLYK5 and AtCERK1."

The problem with this model is that it does not account for the relatively low binding affinity of AtCERK1 for chitin and the fact that mutations (AtCERK1<sup>A138H</sup>) predicted to disrupt chitin binding did not block AtCERK1 autophosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2012b</a>). These discrepancies can now be explained by the interaction of AtCERK1 with AtLYK5, which binds chitin with a significantly higher affinity than AtCERK1. Indeed, AtLYK5 is required for AtCERK1 dimerization and also kinase activation. The data suggest that AtLYK5 exists in the cell, in the absence of chitin, as a homodimer. Chitin binds to AtLYK5 leading to its association with AtCERK1, dimerization and kinase activation. In this way, chitin signaling is transduced downstream through AtCERK1 kinase activity."

In rice, one long-chain chitooligosaccharide is sandwiched between two OsCEBiP monomers. Chitin treatment induces the association of OsCEBiP with OsCERK1, which activates the OsCERK1 intracellular kinase domain (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hayafune et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Shimizu et al., 2010</a>). However, in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, the three CEBiP-like proteins are not required for chitin-triggered innate immunity (<a href=\"#bib50\">Shinya et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wan et al., 2012</a>). Instead, AtLYK5 appears to play a similar role as CEBiP as a chitin-binding receptor to mediate AtCERK1 activation through ligand-induced association. These two systems are very similar since both OsCEBiP and AtLYK5 lack the intracellular kinase function. OsCEBiP has no intracellular kinase domain, while AtLYK5 contains an intracellular kinase domain that lacks activity. However, the AtLYK5 intracellular kinase domain does appear to have biological function, likely by mediating protein\u2013protein interactions. It is likely that the chitin receptor complex functions as a heterotetramer in both rice (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hayafune et al., 2014</a>) and <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), although this needs to be confirmed. Such an oligomer complex could explain why in vitro receptor binding affinities (\u223c1 \u00b5M) do not correlate well with the measured responses of plants to chitin elicitation at nM concentrations (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2002</a>). An oligomeric AtCERK1 receptor complex is also consistent with the finding that AtLYM1 and AtLYM3 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Willmann et al., 2011</a>) are necessary for PGN-induced MTI. All these studies suggest that the primary function of AtCERK1/OsCERK1 is not chitin binding per se, but to serve as a receptor scaffold for interaction with chitin binding co-receptors and, most importantly, to provide intracellular kinase activity."

Previously published data, also using ITC, measured the chitopentaose binding affinity of WGA in the low \u00b5M range, while the binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) to shorter chitin oligomers (GlcNAc)<sub>2\u20134</sub> was significantly lower (i.e., mM level; <a href=\"#bib2\">Asensio, et al., 2000</a>). ITC is one of the best methods to study protein\u2013protein interactions or protein-ligand association. Since ITC detects protein\u2013protein or protein-ligand interaction directly which is label-free, the binding affinity value might be slightly different from other methods. For example, in the case of WGA, ITC values (K<sub>d</sub>) for binding to chitobiose and chitotriose were 1.6 mM and 117 \u00b5M, respectively, (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asensio, et al., 2000</a>), while similar measurements using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) gave Kd values of 165 \u00b5M and 45 \u00b5M, respectively (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lienenmann et al., 2009</a>). Published reports for the chitin binding affinity for AtCERK1 also vary widely. For example, (<a href=\"#bib19\">Iizasa et al., 2010</a>) measured the affinity of AtCERK1 for chitin on a solid surface (commercial chitin magnetic beads) and reported a value (K<sub>d</sub>) of 82 nM. It is difficult to reconcile this number with other values obtained by ITC. One possible explanation is that the use of a solid surface promoted oligomerization of AtCERK1 resulting in an enhancement of binding affinity. In contrast, using ITC, the binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) of AtCERK1 for chitotetrose, chitopentaose, and chitooctaose was measured as 159 \u00b5M, 66 \u00b5M, and 45 \u00b5M, respectively (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2012b</a>). However, these studies were performed with significantly higher protein and ligand concentration (i.e., 0.1 mM AtCERK1 protein vs 4 mM chitotetraose or chitopentaose, and 2.4 mM chitooctaose) than used in our study. Again, such high protein concentrations could have promoted oligomerization of the AtCERK1 protein, which would affect the binding affinities."

AtLYK3 appears to be involved in recognizing short chain (dp = 4\u20135) lipo-chitooligosaccarides and chitooligosaccarides (<a href=\"#bib28\">Liang et al., 2013</a>). However, this recognition leads to a suppression of MTI. The role of AtLYK2 remains unknown but it should be noted that this gene shows very low expression in all tissues examined (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liang et al, 2014</a>). AtCERK1/AtLYK1, AtLYK4 and AtLYK5 all appear to mediate the plant response to chitin elicitation leading to MTI. Previously, we reported that the Ler ecotype <i>Atlyk5-1</i> mutant was not defective in chitin-induced MTI. However, our current data show that this mutant likely represents a weak mutant allele, perhaps due to the 3\u2032 position of the transposon insertion. The Ler ecotype is also not ideal for studying chitin signaling since it shows a generally weaker response compared to Col-0. In contrast, the Col-0 ecotype <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant showed a reduced response to chitin treatment in all assays tested, including pathogen response. The phenotype of the <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant was reversed by genetic complementation with the wild-type AtLYK5 gene."

The functions of AtLYK4 and AtLYK5 are partially redundant in that single mutants retain residual responses to chitin, while <i>Atlyk4/Atlyk5-2</i> double mutant plants show a complete lack of response to chitin, similar to the <i>Atcerk1</i> mutants. However, AtLYK5 appears to have the predominant role in chitin elicitation, as judged by the relative strength of the <i>Atlyk4</i> and <i>Atlyk5-2</i> mutant phenotypes. There are biochemical differences in the function of AtLYK4 and AtLYK5; for example, AtLYK4 interacts with AtCERK1 independently of the presence of chitin, while AtLYK5-AtCERK1 interaction is chitin dependent. The biological significance of these differences and the functional redundancy of AtLYK4 and AtLYK5 are currently unclear. One possibility is that AtLYK4 also functions as a chitin binding receptor to mediate the plant chitin repsonse."

                        "text": "Receptor homodimerization or oligomerization and subsequent phosphorylation are common mechanisms for ligand-mediate receptor activation. <i>Arabidopsis</i> examples include AtBRI1 homodimerization and heterodimerization with AtBAK1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nam and Li, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Santiago, et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sun, et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2005</a>). AtFLS2 appears to exist in the cell as a homodimer before and after ligand perception and then associates with AtBAK1 upon flagellin treatment (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albert, et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chinchilla et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heese et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sun et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sun, et al., 2013b</a>). The suggested mechanism is that ligand perception triggers autophosphorylation between the homodimer or trans-autophosphorylation between/among hetero-interacting proteins to initiate cellular signaling. It appears that all LysM receptors may function as a protein complex. For example, in leguminous plants, the LysM domain, Nod factor receptors (e.g., <i>Lotus japonicas</i> Nod factor receptor 1 and 5; LjNFR1 and LjNFR5) function as a heterodimer to mediate high affinity binding to the lipo-chitooligosaccharide Nod factor (<a href=\"#bib6\">Broghammer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gust et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Madsen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Radutoiu et al., 2003</a>). It should be emphasized that this model for Nod factor binding is very similar to that of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> chitin receptor. In both cases, one LysM RLK (CERK1/NFR1) has an active intracellular kinase domain but interacts with a second LysM RLK (LYK5/NFR5) that lacks intracellular kinase activity. This similarity underlines the now well recognized evolutionary link between chitin, Nod factor and mycorrhizal (Myc) factor recognition (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liang et al., 2014</a>)."

Prior to acceptance you need, however, to address the issues listed below: 1) A major criticism concerns the binding data obtained by ITC. While an affinity constant for WGA (for a positive control) is given, there is no comparable number for chitin affinities of AtCERK1 and AtLYK5. The only statement found is that AtLYK5 has a comparable Kd as WGA, and is 200-fold more sensitive to chitin than AtCERK1. It was unclear to us, however, how the numbers given in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> or any information in the text support these statements. Here, it is absolutely mandatory to give Kd values and an easily understandable description of how these values were determined. In addition, it should be shown that chitin binding as determined by ITC is ligand-specific. Here, competition assays with elicitor-active and inactive chitin fragments should be provided. In addition, a comprehensive discussion of apparent discrepancies between published chitin binding constants for CERK1 (Liu, 2012 45 uM, <a href=\"#bib19\">Iizasa, 2010</a>, 82 nM) and those determined in this study should be provided. This is important as the authors claim that the binding affinity of LYK5 is substantially higher than that of CERK1 and thus makes this protein the genuine chitin receptor."

However, to address criticism, we did conduct direct binding studies of LYK5 with chitotetraose and found no binding (See <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, as would be expected of a receptor involved in chitin elicitation, LYK5 appears to prefer longer chitin oligomers."

Basically, we feel that the previous studies had technical flaws and, in both cases, binding was done under conditions that would be predicted to favor protein oligomerization which would give an artificially higher binding affinity. In the case of Liu et al this is due to the very high concentrations of protein (0.1 mM) and ligand (4mM or 2.4mM) used in their binding assays. In the case of Iizasa et al, oligomerization would have been favored due to the fact that binding was measured against a solid substrate (chitin beads). Of course, this is conjecture on our part but we believe this is a likely explanation for the apparent discrepancy in the results. Perhaps more importantly, in our case, since we used proteins purified at the same time and assays done under identical conditions, a direct comparison of AtCERK1 and AtLYK5 binding was possible."

Based on our own experience, this is due to an inability to express the proteins in sufficient quantity for such studies. We consider ourselves fortunate that we were able to get enough CERK1 and LYK5 proteins to do the studies described in the paper. Unfortunately, the same was not true of LYK4. Using the same conditions we used for CERK1/LYK4, we tried to express the LYK4 extracellular domain in <i>E.coli</i> but obtained poor expression. What protein that was produced was insoluble and efforts to solubilize and refold have, thus far, proven unsuccessful. Therefore, although we would like to address the reviewers and our own curiosity about LYK4, this is going to have to wait until we work out a condition to get sufficient protein for binding studies. Since our current paper focuses on LYK5, these experiments concerning LYK4 are not really pertinent to the story being described. The data support the model that LYK5 is the major chitin binding protein, while LYK4 plays a minor role. We certainly hope to overcome the technical problems with regard to LYK4 expression and, if successful, will likely publish this as a separate story with the main focus on LYK4."
