A key downstream component of Ft signaling is the atypical myosin Dachs (D). Multiple regions of the intracellular domain of Ft have been implicated in regulating growth and PCP but how Ft regulates D is not known. Mutations in <i>Fbxl7</i>, which encodes an F-box protein, result in tissue overgrowth and abnormalities in proximodistal patterning that phenocopy deleting a specific portion of the intracellular domain (ICD) of Ft that regulates both growth and PCP. Fbxl7 binds to this same portion of the Ft ICD, co-localizes with Ft to the proximal edge of cells and regulates the levels and asymmetry of D at the apical membrane. Fbxl7 can also regulate the trafficking of proteins between the apical membrane and intracellular vesicles. Thus Fbxl7 functions in a subset of pathways downstream of Ft and links Ft to D localization."

A key downstream component of Ft signaling is the atypical myosin Dachs (D). Multiple regions of the intracellular domain of Ft have been implicated in regulating growth and PCP but how Ft regulates D is not known. Mutations in <i>Fbxl7</i>, which encodes an F-box protein, result in tissue overgrowth and abnormalities in proximodistal patterning that phenocopy deleting a specific portion of the intracellular domain (ICD) of Ft that regulates both growth and PCP. Fbxl7 binds to this same portion of the Ft ICD, co-localizes with Ft to the proximal edge of cells and regulates the levels and asymmetry of D at the apical membrane. Fbxl7 can also regulate the trafficking of proteins between the apical membrane and intracellular vesicles. Thus Fbxl7 functions in a subset of pathways downstream of Ft and links Ft to D localization."

The Hippo signaling pathway has emerged as a key regulator of organ size (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib45\">Pan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Halder and Johnson, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tapon and Harvey, 2012</a>). While most components of this pathway were originally discovered using genetic screens in <i>Drosophila</i>, mammalian orthologs of those genes perform similar functions. Additionally, mutations in several components of the pathway have been described in human cancers. An exciting aspect of the Hippo pathway is that its growth-regulating activity can be modulated by cell-surface proteins that are capable of binding to ligands expressed on adjacent cells. Such interactions may be especially important for achieving precise control of growth at a local level that is necessary for generating the detailed features of an organ."

In addition to regulating growth, Ft also regulates planar cell polarity (PCP), oriented cell division and proximodistal patterning of appendages (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib64\">Thomas and Strutt, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sharma and McNeill, 2013</a>) and its regulated activity therefore impacts the size and shape of organs. The Ft protein localizes to the cell membrane just apical to the adherens junctions (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ma et al., 2003</a>). It has a large extracellular domain composed of 34 cadherin domains as well as 4 EGF-like domains and 2 laminin G domains (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mahoney et al., 1991</a>) that binds to another large cadherin, Dachsous (Ds) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Clark et al., 1995</a>), on adjacent cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2004</a>). Ft\u2013Ds interactions are modulated by the kinase Four-Jointed (Fj), which resides in the Golgi and phosphorylates the extracellular domains of both Ft and Ds (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ishikawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brittle et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Simon et al., 2010</a>).

First, Ft influences the protein levels of Warts (Wts), a kinase that regulates the activity and subcellular location of the pro-growth transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cho et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rauskolb et al., 2011</a>). Additionally, mutations in <i>ft</i> disrupt the localization of Expanded (Ex), a FERM-domain protein that functions upstream of Hippo (Hpo) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bennett and Harvey, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Silva et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Willecke et al., 2006</a>), though other studies suggest Ft and Ex act in parallel (<a href=\"#bib17\">Feng and Irvine, 2007</a>)."

Additionally, PCP defects in <i>ft</i> mutants are partially rescued by loss of D (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mao et al., 2006</a>). D localizes to the apical membrane where, in cells of the wing disc, it localizes preferentially to the distal edge of the cell (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mao et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ambegaonkar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bosveld et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brittle et al., 2012</a>).

However, the overall levels of D protein are not obviously changed (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mao et al., 2006</a>). It has been proposed that Ft restricts growth by negatively regulating the levels of D at the apical membrane and that it regulates the D-dependent PCP functions by maintaining D asymmetry (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rogulja et al., 2008</a>)."

Ft does not bind to D itself, indicating that there must be one or more proteins that bind to Ft and mediate its regulation of D localization at the membrane. In an attempt to identify signaling pathways downstream of Ft, several recent studies have made systematic deletions in the intracellular domain (ICD) of Ft (<a href=\"#bib43\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bossuyt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>). These deletion studies implicate multiple non-overlapping regions in the ICD that differentially affect growth, PCP and organ shape, suggesting that Ft signals via multiple effector pathways. Additionally, several proteins have been shown to bind to the Ft ICD including the transcriptional repressor Atrophin/Grunge which regulates PCP (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fanto et al., 2003</a>), the novel protein Lowfat that regulates Ft protein levels (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mao et al., 2009</a>), and the casein kinase I protein Discs overgrown (Dco) that phosphorylates the Ft ICD (<a href=\"#bib18\">Feng and Irvine, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sopko et al., 2009</a>). Also, the palmitoyltransferase approximated (App) is needed for D localization to the membrane (<a href=\"#bib42\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2008</a>). However, for each of these proteins, their role in mediating the regulation of D levels or asymmetry by Ft is not well understood."

Fbxl7 has a conserved human ortholog (FBXL7<i>)</i> that shares 49% amino acid identity over the region spanning the F-box and the LRRs.

A third allele was identified fortuitously in an unrelated stock. Mutant clones of all three alleles were overrepresented in the adult eye when compared to clones of the parental <i>FRT82B</i> chromosome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), suggesting that these <i>Fbxl7</i> mutations cause increased tissue growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>).

In <i>Fbxl7</i> mutant clones, there is, at best, a very slight elevation of Ds levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013F\u2033</a>). Thus, the effects of Fbxl7 on Ds levels are minor compared to the effects on Ft levels. Additionally, we could not detect Ds in immunoprecipitates of Fbxl7 when the two proteins were co-expressed in S2 cells (not shown). Together, these findings suggest that Fbxl7 binds to and functions with Ft rather than Ds. Despite this, we did observe co-localization of Fbxl7 and Ds at apical membranes and in more basally located cytoplasmic puncta (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013G\u2033</a>). In the absence of evidence for direct interactions between Fbxl7 and Ds, their co-localization, at least at the cell surface, may result from Fbxl7 bound to Ft that is in turn bound to Ds."

We also examined a different deletion, <i>ft\u0394F</i>, in which wings from these flies are not enlarged but have greatly reduced spacing between the cross veins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). In <i>ft</i><sup><i>Grv</i></sup><i>/ft</i><sup><i>8</i></sup>; <i>ft\u0394F</i> imaginal discs, the apical localization of Fbxl7 is not disrupted (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2032\u2013F\u2034</a>). Similarly in <i>ft</i><sup><i>61</i></sup> clones, which display strong overgrowth, Fbxl7 localization was normal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013G\u2033</a>). Thus, the apical localization of Fbxl7 requires the Ft D domain but neither the F domain nor the motif that is disrupted by the <i>ft</i><sup><i>61</i></sup> allele."

Indeed, we observed a population of intracellular puncta, likely vesicles, that contain both Fbxl7 and D (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I\u2013I\u2033</a>). Moreover Fbxl7 overexpression can cause an overall shift in D from the apical membrane to the interior of the cell (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I\u2034</a>). To further characterize the population of vesicles that contain Fbxl7, we examined the localization of FLAG-Fbxl7 with 59 different markers that each labeled a subpopulation of vesicles and with several proteins that have been identified as interactors of Ft in proteomic studies (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kwon et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). No co-localization was observed with most of these markers (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013G</a> as examples) and partial co-localization was seen with two markers of the retromer pathway, Snx3 and Vps35 (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1H\u2013I\u2033</a>). However, strong co-localization was seen with a protein-trap insertion of GFP in the <i>cindr</i> locus. Cindr is thought to be an adapter protein that links membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton (\u2018Discussion\u2019). In basal sections, there is almost complete overlap between GFP-Cindr and FLAG-Fbxl7 in puncta (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013E\u2033</a>). GFP-Cindr is normally localized to the subapical membrane, apical to E-cadherin, but its localization there is less punctate and more diffuse than that of FLAG-Fbxl7 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). When tagged versions of both proteins were expressed in S2 cells, Cindr co-immunoprecipitated with full length Fbxl7 or with a version containing only the LRRs (Fbxl7\u03942) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>)."

In these clones, we observed a dramatic re-localization of GFP-Cindr.

Thus, Fbxl7 is capable of displacing a protein associated with the apical membrane into intracellular vesicles. Importantly, this is unlikely to be a consequence of increased Ft in the apical membranes of Fbxl7-ovexpressing cells, since increasing Ft levels has no effect on the apical localization of GFP-Cindr (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1J\u2013J\u2033</a>). We next tested whether changes in Cindr levels are capable of modifying Fbxl7 phenotypes. Indeed we find that the reduction in wing size from overexpression of Fbxl7 was suppressed by co-expression of GFP-Cindr (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J\u2013L</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1K</a>).

Moreover, reducing Cindr levels by RNAi did not elicit phenotypic abnormalities in wings suggestive of defects in Ft or D (not shown). However, the ability of Fbxl7 to cause changes in the localization of Cindr and Ft indicates that it can regulate trafficking of proteins between the apical membrane and the interior of the cell in either direction, and the pathways that regulate the trafficking of these proteins and D might share common components. Some of these shared components could potentially be direct targets of Fbxl7 ubiquitylation."

                                "text": "Recent studies have revealed that Ft's effects on distinct pathways may be genetically separated, and that multiple effector domains can contribute to the same function. Indeed, the growth-suppressing function of Ft may occur via at least two regions of the Ft ICD. One or more regions between amino acids 4834 and 4899 in full-length Ft appear responsible for Ft\u2019s ability to regulate Hippo signaling (labeled HM in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7M</a>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bossuyt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>). Several mutations within this region compromise this function of Ft and cause massive tissue overgrowth (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bossuyt et al., 2013</a>). Intriguingly, an allele of <i>ft</i>, <i>ft</i><sup><i>61</i></sup>, which harbors such a mutation, showed neither an effect on the recruitment of Fbxl7 to the apical membrane nor on the binding of Ft to Fbxl7. Thus, signaling via this region of the ICD appears to be independent of Fbxl7. A second, more C-terminal region of the Ft ICD (Region D in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7M</a>) that extends between amino acids 4975 and 4993 of full-length Ft, is removed by the <i>ft\u0394D</i> deletion and also has a growth-suppressive function albeit weaker than that of HM (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pan et al., 2013</a>). This second growth-suppressive pathway requires the function of Fbxl7, as the protein generated by the <i>ft\u0394D</i> allele cannot bind to Fbxl7 nor can it localize Fbxl7 to the apical membrane. Additionally, the phenotypic abnormalities of null alleles of <i>ft</i> rescued by <i>ft\u0394D</i> are very similar, if not identical to those of <i>Fbxl7</i> mutants. Furthermore, like <i>ft\u0394D, Fbxl7</i> mutations do not display overt abnormalities of hair orientation in the wing (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E\u2013J</a>), or abdomen (not shown)."

Thus, while these two pathways can be dissociated at the level of the Ft ICD, they nevertheless seem to converge further downstream. This point of convergence likely involves D since the overgrowth of <i>ft</i> mutant tissue can be suppressed completely by eliminating D function (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cho et al., 2006</a>). Indeed, it has previously been suggested that Ft regulates growth by restricting the levels of apical D, and regulates PCP by influencing the planar asymmetry of apical D (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rogulja et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pan et al., 2013</a>)."

D is normally biased towards the distal edge of the cell; in <i>Fbxl7</i> mutants, D is more evenly distributed around the cell perimeter. The asymmetric localization of D depends on at least two different regions of Ft (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pan et al., 2013</a>). One is the region that binds to Fbxl7 (Region D) and the other is composed of the last three amino acids at the C-terminus of the protein (Region F in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7M</a>), which is not necessary for Fbxl7 localization to the apical membrane. Thus, for the regulation of D asymmetry as well, there appears to be an Fbxl7-independent pathway. The existence of multiple downstream effector pathways that converge on common biological outcomes suggests that these pathways might function redundantly to some extent and thus provide robustness. This might also explain why the phenotypes elicited by overexpression of Fbxl7 are, in general, more severe than those observed in loss-of-function mutations."

We have demonstrated that, in addition to the apical membrane, Fbxl7 localizes to vesicles. Moreover, FLAG-Fbxl7 vesicles can contain Ft, Ds and D, and these may be related to the apical puncta observed on cell edges. This localization is likely specific, since we do not see Fbxl7 co-localization with other cell surface proteins such as Crumbs, Notch, and E-cadherin (not shown). Currently very little is known about the role of each of these proteins in vesicles. However, there is an increasing appreciation that most transmembrane proteins, and even proteins that are associated with the inner leaflet of the cell membrane are maintained at the plasma membrane by a dynamic process involving endocytosis and vesicle recycling (e.g., <a href=\"#bib52\">Schmick et al., 2014</a>)."

However, Ft levels are slightly elevated in <i>Fbxl7</i> mutants, which display mild overgrowth. Therefore the mutant phenotype cannot be explained by the effect on Ft. Another known regulator of apical Ft levels is <i>lowfat</i> (<i>lft</i>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mao et al., 2009</a>). Fbxl7 and Lft appear to regulate Ft in different ways. Lft overexpression, like Fbxl7, increases Ft levels. However, while Ft levels are decreased in <i>lft</i> mutant cells, Ft levels are increased in <i>Fbxl7</i> mutant cells, though less so compared to <i>Fbxl7</i> overexpression. Interestingly, for many proteins that regulate cellular trafficking, similar phenotypic abnormalities are observed with gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations, since the normal execution of the process requires the protein to shuttle efficiently between two states (<a href=\"#bib47\">Park et al., 1993</a>).

This finding, together with the observed increase in basal levels of D upon Fbxl7 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I\u2013I\u2034</a>), suggests that Fbxl7 may function to regulate D trafficking in a similar manner. Cindr and its mammalian orthologues Cin85 and CD2AP are thought to regulate interactions between membrane proteins and actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib21\">Haglund et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Petrelli et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Soubeyran et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Johnson et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2012</a>).

Recruitment of specific substrates results in their poly-ubiquitylation and degradation, or mono-ubiquitylation, which can have non-degradative signaling roles. In addition, some F-box proteins have SCF-independent roles (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nelson et al., 2013</a>). Fbxl proteins are thought to recruit substrates to the SCF complex through the interaction with their LRR domains, and substrates have been identified for several Fbxls such as Skp2 (Fbxl1), which degrades p27 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carrano et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sutterluty et al., 1999</a>).

Fbxl7 has one described substrate in mice, Aurora A (<a href=\"#bib14\">Coon et al., 2012</a>). However we do not believe Aurora A is a relevant substrate in <i>Drosophila</i>, as we do not observe Ft signaling defects when Aurora A is knocked down or overexpressed (not shown). The identification of F-box protein substrates has mainly been accomplished by unbiased approaches (<a href=\"#bib57\">Skaar et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, a combination of unbiased approaches, involving proteomics, genetic interaction screens, and identifying proteins that co-localize with Fbxl7 in vesicles could be used to identify Fbxl7 substrates."

Wing discs were immunostained for Dachs and F-actin and imaged under identical settings at 20x to determine P-D orientation, and at 63x to image the dorsal portion of the wing pouch where Dachs asymmetry is highest. Images were rotated so that the P-D axis of the wing pouch oriented vertically (90\u00b0 and 270\u00b0). A cropped 24.8 \u00d7 24.8um (500 \u00d7 500px) square was used to quantify the mean fluorescence intensity of Dachs or actin along each cell edge while recording the angle of the cell edge relative to the P-D orientation. Cell edge data were measured using a 1 pixel width line. Mean fluorescence of cell edges oriented in the P-D orientation (45\u00b0\u2013135\u00b0) or the A-P orientation (0\u00b0\u201345\u00b0; 135\u00b0\u2013180\u00b0) was isolated into two different lists, which were each averaged. The ratio of mean fluorescence of the A-P orientation to P-D orientation gives the P-D/A-P localization. For example, asymmetric localization to the P-D sides of cells will give higher mean intensities on cell edges in the A-P orientation. Quantifications were performed on eight cropped boxes from different discs for each group. Statistical significance between groups was determined by one-way ANOVA using (Tukey's test)."

They investigate relationships between several proteins including Fat, Dachsous, Dachs, Dco and vesicle trafficking proteins such as Cindr. The experiments are very rigorous and thorough, employing multiple mutant alleles, RNAi lines, transgenes, antibodies and biochemical reagents. It seems quite clear that Fbxl7 functions downstream of Fat to regulate growth and controls the apical localization and abundance of Dachs, although its mechanistic links to Dco and Cindr are not entirely clear. The manuscript represents a huge amount of work and while there are some loose ends mechanistically, substantial efforts have been made to make conclusions without over-interpreting data or forcing results."

However, it is still possible that the F domain's effects are mediated by Fbxl7, especially since Fbxl7 has residual binding to Fat lacking the D domain. It would be helpful if they tested how important Fbxl7 is for Fat's effects on Dachs. Can a form of Fat deficient in Fbxl7 binding, such as \u0394D, still improve Dachs in a fat mutant?"

The authors suggest that Fbxl7 has a role mediating some of Fat's effects on Dachs levels and asymmetry, likely by binding Fat's D domain. They also argue that the F domain's effects on Dachs asymmetry are not mediated by Fbxl7, but this is only based on the finding that removing the F domain does not detectably change Fbxl7 binding. However, it is still possible that the F domain's effects are mediated by Fbxl7, especially since Fbxl7 has residual binding to Fat lacking the D domain. It would be helpful if they tested how important Fbxl7 is for Fat's effects on Dachs. Can a form of Fat deficient in Fbxl7 binding, such as \u0394D, still improve Dachs in a fat mutant?</i>"

We think the presence of a low level of binding in the \u0394D mutant may simply be that the D deletion only partially removes the site that binds Ft and may therefore reduce the binding affinity substantially.
