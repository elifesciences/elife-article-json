The identity of the cell population and the signaling pathways involved in the progression of transition zone squamous cell carcinoma are poorly understood, hence representing limited options for targeted therapies. Here, we identify a highly tumorigenic cancer stem cell population in a mouse model of transitional epithelial carcinoma and uncover a novel mechanism by which loss of TGF\u03b2 receptor II (<i>Tgfbr2</i>) mediates invasion and metastasis through de-repression of ELMO1, a RAC-activating guanine exchange factor, specifically in cancer stem cells of transition zone tumors. We identify ELMO1 as a novel target of TGF\u03b2 signaling and show that restoration of <i>Tgfbr2</i> results in a complete block of ELMO1 in vivo. Knocking down <i>Elmo1</i> impairs metastasis of carcinoma cells to the lung, thereby providing insights into the mechanisms of progression of <i>Tgfbr2</i>-deficient invasive transition zone squamous cell carcinoma."

The identity of the cell population and the signaling pathways involved in the progression of transition zone squamous cell carcinoma are poorly understood, hence representing limited options for targeted therapies. Here, we identify a highly tumorigenic cancer stem cell population in a mouse model of transitional epithelial carcinoma and uncover a novel mechanism by which loss of TGF\u03b2 receptor II (<i>Tgfbr2</i>) mediates invasion and metastasis through de-repression of ELMO1, a RAC-activating guanine exchange factor, specifically in cancer stem cells of transition zone tumors. We identify ELMO1 as a novel target of TGF\u03b2 signaling and show that restoration of <i>Tgfbr2</i> results in a complete block of ELMO1 in vivo. Knocking down <i>Elmo1</i> impairs metastasis of carcinoma cells to the lung, thereby providing insights into the mechanisms of progression of <i>Tgfbr2</i>-deficient invasive transition zone squamous cell carcinoma."

In cervical cancer, mutations or loss of TGF\u03b2 downstream effectors SMAD2 and SMAD4 are common (<a href=\"#bib42\">Maliekal et al., 2003</a>), and loss of nuclear SMAD2 and SMAD4 is associated with poor survival (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kloth et al., 2008</a>). In genital SCC, TGF\u03b2 receptor (TGF\u03b2RII) protein expression is decreased and loss of phosphorylated SMAD2 is observed, even at early stages, suggesting that loss of TGF\u03b2 signaling may be an early event in carcinogenesis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guasch et al., 2007</a>). Mouse models targeting components of the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway have been generated (<a href=\"#bib51\">Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2006</a>).

To date, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of <i>Tgfbr2</i>-deficient transition zone carcinoma development and metastasis are unknown. In this study, we used the murine <i>Tgfbr2-</i>deficient anorectal SCC model to study the consequences of loss of TGF\u03b2 signaling in CSC-driven tumor propagation and metastasis. We found that these <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO anorectal SCC, which spontaneously metastasize to the lungs, contain a unique population of epithelial cells with features of CSCs, including: expression of the CSC marker CD34, clonogenicity in vitro, tumorigenicity in vivo, and upregulation of genes associated with invasion and metastasis. Using RNA-Sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we uncovered a novel mechanism linking loss of TGF\u03b2 signaling with invasion and metastasis via the RAC-activating GEF ELMO1. We show that <i>Elmo1</i> is a novel target of TGF\u03b2 signaling via SMAD3 and that restoration of <i>Tgfbr2</i> results in complete block of ELMO1 in vivo. Knocking down <i>Elmo1</i> impairs metastasis to the lung, providing a new therapeutic avenue to target the early phase of metastasis in highly aggressive transition zone tumorigenesis."

To lineage trace <i>Tgfbr2-</i>deficient cells within these transitional SCC and enable isolation of specific <i>Tgfbr2-</i>deficient tumor cell populations, we backcrossed these mice into mice containing loxP sites flanking a STOP sequence preceding eYFP inserted into the <i>Rosa26</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), such that all K14-positive epithelial cells, including the anorectal SCC cells, while conditionally null for <i>Tgfbr2</i> expressed YFP (cKO mice, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). We had previously identified a population of cells with stem cell characteristics, including colocalization with known stem cell markers, such as CD34, in the anorectal transition zone of wild-type mice (<a href=\"#bib58\">Runck et al., 2010</a>). We hypothesized that tumors arising at the anorectal transition zone in the <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO mice would contain a population of CD34-expressing cells, and that these cells would represent a population of tumor-propagating cells or so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs). Based on the idea that CSCs should reside at the tumor\u2013stroma border, we thought that CSCs of anorectal SCCs should express abundant integrins. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed marker expression within histologic sections of <i>Tgfbr2</i>-deficient anorectal tumors. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that all YFP<sup>+</sup>SCC cells located at the tumor\u2013stroma interface expressed high levels of the hemidesmosomal \u03b16 integrin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and the focal adhesion marker \u03b21 integrin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), and a fraction of these expressed CD34 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). These three markers were used to isolate discrete populations of cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Tumors were dissociated into a single-cell suspension as previously described (<a href=\"#bib44\">McCauley and Guasch, 2013</a>), stained with antibodies, and subjected to flow cytometry. Blood cells, endothelial cells, macrophages and dead cells were excluded, and live, K14+YFP+ epithelial cells were further purified upon \u03b16-integrin and \u03b21-integrin expression. Of these live, YFP+, \u03b16-integrin+, \u03b21-integrin+ cells, distinct CD34-negative (CD34\u2212) and CD34-positive (CD34+) populations of cells were observed and isolated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). The frequency of epithelial CD34+ cells within the tumor varied between mice, from 7% to 34%. When plated on a feeder layer of irradiated fibroblasts, both YFP+CD34\u2212and YFP+CD34+ cells sorted from <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO SCC formed colonies; however, CD34\u2212 colonies appeared to be differentiated paraclones and were unable to be passed more than once, whereas CD34+ colonies appeared to form holoclones, were able to proliferate extensively, and survived unlimited passage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H\u2013I</a>). CD34+ SCC cells did not respond to TGF\u03b2 stimulation, confirming the loss of TGF\u03b2RII, and aberrantly expressed Keratin 8, a hallmark of SCC (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ikeda et al., 2008</a>), compared to keratinocytes isolated from the anal canal of wild-type mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>).

After tertiary transplant of CD34+ SCC cells, 8/13 mice developed anorectal tumors, compared to 1 mouse of 13 transplanted with CD34\u2212 SCC cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). YFP+ cells negative for \u03b16-integrin and \u03b21-integrin were unable to form tumors upon transplantation (n\u00a0=\u00a014), indicating that not every cell type within the <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO anorectal SCC is tumorigenic. Tertiary anorectal tumors maintained the tumor hierarchy of the primary and secondary <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO SCC, and selection for CD34+ CSCs resulted in an increased ratio of CD34+ cells (75%) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013E</a>). In fact, in the single tertiary tumor that formed after transplant of CD34\u2212 SCC cells, CD34 was re-expressed in 49% of YFP+ epithelial tumor cells by FACS (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>), indicating that CD34 expression is dynamic in vivo. This is in accordance with the dynamic CD34 expression found in a DMBA-induced model of <i>Tgfbr2</i> deficient SCC of the backskin (<a href=\"#bib63\">Schober and Fuchs, 2011</a>). Whereas CSC marker expression may be dynamic (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clevers, 2011</a>), CD34 remains a useful marker to assay the CSC properties of a population of cells isolated from murine SCC. Taken together, the ability of CD34+ cells, which lack TGF\u03b2 signaling, to form secondary and tertiary tumors that recapitulate the hierarchy of the <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO primary tumors suggests that CD34+ SCC cells are able to self-renew and differentiate in vivo."

We compared the profile of CD34+ CSCs from our <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO anorectal SCC to the CSCs purified from malignant skin SCC in mice from various genetic backgrounds treated with the chemical mutagen 7,12-dimethyl-benz[a] anthracene (DMBA) to induce an activating mutation in <i>Hras</i> (<a href=\"#bib63\">Schober and Fuchs, 2011</a>). In DMBA-induced <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO skin SCC, Schober et al reported two CSC populations: CD34<sup>Hi</sup> and CD34<sup>Lo</sup>, with the CD34<sup>Lo</sup> CSC population demonstrating increased tumorigenicity over the CD34<sup>Hi</sup> population. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that only six genes were common between the CSC from <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO anorectal CD34+ cells and DMBA-induced <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO skin CD34<sup>Hi</sup> population (***p value=1.57\u00d710<sup>\u22127</sup>) and seven genes were common in the DMBA-induced <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO skin CD34<sup>Lo</sup>population (***p value=7.48\u00d710<sup>\u22125</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As expected in malignant cancers, these genes are involved in ECM organization, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis but none was related to the RAC/RHO/RAS pathway. When we compared the skin CSC population from DMBA-induced <i>Tgfbr2</i> and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) double KO mice, in which SCC initiation is delayed compared to <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO skin, nine genes were common between the <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO anorectal CD34+ CSCs and the CD34<sup>Lo</sup>population (***p value=1.98\u00d710<sup>\u221210</sup>). Similarly, only 11 genes involved in ECM organization and other functions were common between the <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO anorectal CD34+ CSCs and the DMBA-induced skin CD34<sup>Lo</sup>population in genetically wild-type mice (***p value=1.49\u00d710<sup>\u221211</sup>). The analysis of skin SCC signatures from FAK single KO mice, which are more refractory to DMBA-induced SCC formation, showed 21 common genes between <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO anorectal CD34+ CSCs and the CD34<sup>Lo</sup>population (***p value=5.35\u00d710<sup>\u221226</sup>) and one gene related to the RAC/RHO/RAS pathway was found in common (<i>Pdgfrb</i>). We also compared our <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO anorectal SCC CD34+ CSC gene signature with DMBA-induced skin SCC CD34+ cells with overexpression of VEGF, which accelerates tumor growth (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2011</a>). We found 40 genes that are upregulated in <i>Tgfbr2</i>-deficient anorectal CD34+ CSCs yet downregulated by VEGF in comparison to DMBA-induced backskin CD34+ CSCs (***p value=2.69\u00d710<sup>\u221253</sup>), and we found 45 genes commonly upregulated between <i>Tgfbr2</i>-deficient anorectal CD34+ CSCs and DMBA-induced SCC CD34+ skin CSCs when mice overexpressed VEGF (***p value=2.62\u00d710<sup>\u221239</sup>). Among these data sets, we found overlap of three RAC/RHO/RAS family genes with <i>Tgfbr2</i>-deficient anorectal CD34+ CSCs, suggesting that dysregulation of the RAC/RHO/RAS pathway may be associated with CSCs within highly aggressive tumors."

Because <i>Dock2</i> and <i>Elmo1</i> mRNA were both upregulated in <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO CD34+ SCC cells, we wondered whether the loss of TGF\u03b2 signaling was responsible for the upregulation of these RAC pathway activators. We probed the promoter regions of the mouse <i>Dock2</i> and <i>Elmo1</i> genes for the consensus SMAD-binding element (SBE) GTCT (<a href=\"#bib13\">Derynck et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Massague and Wotton, 2000</a>) and the consensus TGF\u03b2-inhibitory element (TIE) GNNTTGGNGN (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kerr et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Frederick et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">McCauley et al., 2014</a>).

These sites were evolutionarily conserved and not found in repeat regions of the genome. Moreover, these sites were not found in the promoter of <i>Elmo2</i>, despite its high degree of similarity with <i>Elmo1</i>. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to determine whether SMAD3, a canonical effector of TGF\u03b2 signaling, bound any of these potential SBEs or TIEs. SMAD3 bound to the TIE on the <i>Elmo1</i> promoter, but not to the SBE (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), and did not bind to any of the sites identified on the <i>Dock2</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

We cloned the full-length <i>Tgfbr2</i> gene into the pLVX-IRES-mCherry lentiviral vector and infected <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO CD34+ SCC cells with this construct or the empty vector. Infection of YFP+CD34+ SCC cells with the rescue construct, but not the empty vector, efficiently restored <i>Tgfbr2</i> mRNA expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D</a>). Rescued CD34+ SCC cells became sensitive to TGF\u03b2 treatment and phosphorylated SMAD2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

Treatment of <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO CD34<sup>+</sup> SCC cells with <i>Elmo1</i> shRNA resulted in 40% (construct #1) or 50% (construct #2) reduction in endogenous <i>Elmo1</i> mRNA levels, compared to cells infected with control shRNA (SH02) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Western blot analysis confirmed this reduction at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). To confirm the specificity of the shRNA, we used a hairpin-resistant ELMO1 cDNA (ELMO1*) in which we had introduced three base mutations in the target sequence of the <i>Elmo1</i> shRNA #2 without affecting the function of ELMO1 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We cloned this construct into the pLVX-IRES-mCherry lentiviral vector and infected <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO CD34+ SCC <i>Elmo1</i> shRNA expressing cells with ELMO1* or the empty vector. Western blot analysis confirmed that overexpression of the hairpin-resistant ELMO1* construct restores similar level of expression of ELMO1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). We performed an in vitro wound healing assay to show that knocking down <i>Elmo1</i> in <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO CD34+ SCC cells affected their ability to migrate and close the wound.

Despite the clinical importance of these tumors, the cellular and molecular mechanisms defining their growth and progression remain unknown. Here, we have taken advantage of a mouse model that develops spontaneous tumors at their anorectal transition zone upon loss of TGF\u03b2 signaling, which recapitulates invasive human anogenital squamous cell carcinoma, to define the cells and mechanisms by which these tumors grow and to identify the signaling pathways upon which they rely when undergoing metastasis."

We have further shown that restoration of TGF\u03b2RII in <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO SCC reduced the frequency of these CD34+ CSCs, demonstrating that loss of TGF\u03b2 signaling is a requirement for CSC maintenance in transition zone carcinoma. This is in accordance with what has been described in <i>Hras</i> mutated DMBA-induced skin SCC, where the frequency of CD34+ CSCs was 10 fold higher in <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO mice than in WT mice (<a href=\"#bib63\">Schober and Fuchs, 2011</a>). However, we find little overlap between gene signatures of CD34+ CSCs from <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO transition zone SCC and from <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO + <i>Hras</i> backskin SCC. Upregulated genes in the CD34+ CSC signature of <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO + <i>Hras</i> backskin SCC include those involved in cell cycle progression and DNA repair (<a href=\"#bib63\">Schober and Fuchs, 2011</a>), whereas the CD34+ CSC signature in our <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO anorectal SCC is primarily comprised of genes involved in invasion, metastasis, and activation of the RAC signaling pathway. Interestingly, tumor cells with low CD34 expression displayed greater tumorigenicity than cells with high CD34 expression in the <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO + <i>Hras</i> backskin SCC (<a href=\"#bib63\">Schober and Fuchs, 2011</a>), whereas we observed a dramatic enrichment for tumorigenicity in CD34+ SCC cells from transition zone tumors. We found very few genes in common between <i>Tgfbr2</i>-deficient anorectal CSCs and CSCs from DMBA-induced <i>Hras</i> skin SCC from WT mice or mice deficient in FAK, which is expected as these mice are refractory to DMBA-induced skin SCC compared to the accelerated skin SCC development in <i>Tgfbr2</i> deficient mice."

When mice were administered the DMBA skin carcinogenesis protocol while overexpressing VEGF, the resulting skin tumors were more aggressive and the stemness profile of CD34+ CSCs was qualitatively altered compared\u00a0to wild-type mice (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2011</a>). We found 45 genes commonly upregulated between <i>Tgfbr2</i>-deficient anorectal CD34+ CSCs and <i>Hras</i> + VEGF overexpressing SCC CD34+ skin CSCs, and 40 genes that were upregulated in <i>Tgfbr2</i>-deficient anorectal CD34+ CSCs but downregulated by VEGF in skin CSCs. Three of these genes (<i>Rgs16</i>, <i>Rassf3</i> and <i>Fam13a</i>) are members of the RAC/RHO/RAS pathway, and dysregulated <i>Rgs16</i> has been associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (<a href=\"#bib50\">Miyoshi et al., 2009</a>). Our gene expression analysis is evidence that the requirements of CSCs within distinct tumor types vary, and that their growth and invasive properties are heterogeneous and context-dependent. Furthermore, our data show that deregulated expression of RAC1 and RAC2 is evident in <i>Tgfbr2</i> deficient transition zone tumors but not in skin SCC in various genetic backgrounds analyzed. While we found three RAC/RHO/RAS family members which were common between <i>Tgfbr2-</i>deficient anorectal CSC and genes up- or down-regulated in DMBA-induced backskin CSCs in the aggressive VEGF gain-of-function mouse model, none of these three genes are RAC-activating GEFs. This suggests that the mechanism linking loss of TGF\u03b2 signaling with de-repression of RAC-activating GEFs is unique to CSCs within transition zone tumors, which may explain their particular aggressiveness and malignancy."

We established the metastatic gene signature of CD34+ CSCs in <i>Tgfbr2</i> cKO anorectal SCC and found that the GEF ELMO1 is a direct target of SMAD3. While more than 70 GEFs have been described to date (<a href=\"#bib56\">Parri et al., 2010</a>), ELMO1 has been specifically identified as oncogenic in a variety of studies (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lazer and Katzav, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jarzynka et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Li et al., 1706</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jiang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Ungefroren et al., 2011</a>). Upregulation of GEFs is a frequent mechanism of increased RAC activity and cancer cell invasion and metastasis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lazer and Katzav, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ensign et al., 2013</a>). We have shown here that loss of TGF\u03b2-mediated repression is one mechanism that may lead to this upregulation. There have been many reports of RAC GTPases functioning downstream of TGF\u03b2 signaling (<a href=\"#bib2\">Atfi et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Meriane et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Faherty et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 2008</a>), but never in the context of elevated GEF expression as a result of loss of TGF\u03b2 signaling. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells that retain TGF\u03b2 signaling, RAC1 regulates SMAD2 and SMAD3 at the post-transcriptional level, shifting TGF\u03b2 from a tumor-suppressive role to a tumor-promoting role (<a href=\"#bib68\">Ungefroren et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that the relationship between the TGF\u03b2 and RHO/RAC GTPase pathways is complex and context-dependent but nevertheless central."

This participation may be through a loss of activity and loss of tumor suppressive function. However, TGF\u03b2 has a complex role in tumor progression. It can act as a tumor promoter or suppressor depending on the tumor type and stage. Identifying the consequences of TGF\u03b2 signaling alterations in cancer and the players in tumor progression and metastasis for each type of cancer is a prerequisite to derive appropriate therapeutic tools. RAC inhibitors exist, but are poorly specific. Identification of key downstream components of TGF\u03b2 signaling, such as ELMO1, offers new perspectives and opportunities."

Following alignment, reads were quantified to generate computing reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM), then normalized using the DESeq algorithm and baselining to the median of all samples. We applied a filter, requiring at least 20 reads in at least one of the four samples. We generated a list of differentially regulated genes by comparing CD34-high samples to CD34-negative samples, with a fold change cutoff of 2.0 (n\u00a0=\u00a0896 entities). Entities were exported to ToppCluster in order to identify enrichment in previously published microarray datasets (Coexpression Ontologies).

Briefly, lungs were inflated with a cocktail containing dispase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 20% collagenase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and Hank\u2019s buffered saline solution (Gibco, Waltham, MA) and dissociated in the same cocktail for 30 min while shaking at 37\u00b0C. Dissociated lung tissue was washed and filtered according to our tumor dissociation protocol (<a href=\"#bib44\">McCauley and Guasch, 2013</a>), with the added treatment of red blood cell lysis buffer according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Whole lungs were sorted for YFP and analyzed using a FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences) and FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) in the Research Flow Cytometry Core at CCHMC. Percent YFP+ cells was calculated by dividing number of YFP+ cells by total cells after gating for appropriately sized single cells by forward scatter and side scatter. Experiments were performed twice in triplicate and statistical significance was determined using paired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test."

A wound was created by removing inserts. Cells were washed with PBS twice to remove detached cells and incubated with medium E low Ca<sup>2+</sup> containing puromycin (1 \u00b5g/ml). The cells were observed under an inverted light microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a CCD camera (Ropper) at X10 objective. Images were taken by MetaMorph software every 10 min for 10 hr. The wound widths of different area at each time points were measured with MetaMorph software. Data result from calculating the slope of linear trend curve of wound widths as a function of time and are representative of three experiments.

They show that a CD34 high potential cancer stem cell population exists in the transition zone SCC and that TGF\u03b2 receptor II loss activates expression of ELMO1, a GEF for Rho family small GTPase protein, identifying a pathway critically for the invasiveness and metastasis of transitional zone SCC. Overall, the reviewers were intrigued by the hypothesis and impressed by the data that identifies a potential cancer stem/initiating cell population and defines the molecular mechanisms that initiate metastatic behavior of these cells."

We have also compared our CD34+ and CD34- anorectal TZ SCC TGFb-deficient signature with other transcriptional profiles of CSC from skin cancers in a TGFb-intact background (DMBA/TPA treated) in a WT background, VEGF gain of function (from Beck et al., 2011) and <i>Sox2</i> cKO background (Boumahdi et al., 2014). There were only 38 genes available in the study using <i>Sox2</i> deletion and unsurprisingly we did not find any genes in common with a p value&lt;0.05, so we did not include a Venn diagram with these data.
