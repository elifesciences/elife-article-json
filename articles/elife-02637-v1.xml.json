SCML2 is a mammalian homolog of <i>Drosophila</i> SCM, a <i>Polycomb</i>-group protein that associates with PRC1. In this study, we show that SCML2A, an SCML2 isoform tightly associated to chromatin, contributes to PRC1 localization and also directly enforces repression of certain <i>Polycomb</i> target genes. SCML2A binds to PRC1 via its SPM domain and interacts with ncRNAs through a novel RNA-binding region (RBR). Targeting of SCML2A to chromatin involves the coordinated action of the MBT domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PRC1 through the SPM domain. Deletion of the RBR reduces the occupancy of SCML2A at target genes and overexpression of a mutant SCML2A lacking the RBR causes defects in PRC1 recruitment. These observations point to a role for ncRNAs in regulating SCML2 function and suggest that SCML2 participates in the epigenetic control of transcription directly and in cooperation with PRC1."

SCML2 is a mammalian homolog of <i>Drosophila</i> SCM, a <i>Polycomb</i>-group protein that associates with PRC1. In this study, we show that SCML2A, an SCML2 isoform tightly associated to chromatin, contributes to PRC1 localization and also directly enforces repression of certain <i>Polycomb</i> target genes. SCML2A binds to PRC1 via its SPM domain and interacts with ncRNAs through a novel RNA-binding region (RBR). Targeting of SCML2A to chromatin involves the coordinated action of the MBT domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PRC1 through the SPM domain. Deletion of the RBR reduces the occupancy of SCML2A at target genes and overexpression of a mutant SCML2A lacking the RBR causes defects in PRC1 recruitment. These observations point to a role for ncRNAs in regulating SCML2 function and suggest that SCML2 participates in the epigenetic control of transcription directly and in cooperation with PRC1."

PcG mutants fail to maintain transcriptional repression of differentiation genes during development, which results in their ectopic expression, compromised patterning of the embryo, and homeotic transformations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lewis, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Struhl, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Simon et al., 1992</a>). Most PcG genes encode proteins that recognize chromatin or modify its structure, often by forming multi-subunit protein complexes such as <i>Polycomb</i> repressive complex 1 (PRC1) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Simon and Kingston, 2009</a>). Genetic screens and biochemical studies have identified several additional PcG proteins that are not stable components of known <i>Polycomb</i> complexes. One of these proteins is sex comb on midleg (SCM), which is required for appropriate body patterning during embryonic development in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib49\">Simon et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bornemann et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">1998</a>).

SCM also belongs to a small family of proteins characterized by the presence of a conserved malignant brain tumor domain (MBT), which functions as a binding module for methylated lysines on histones (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bonasio et al., 2010a</a>), further suggesting that SCM might function on chromatin. In addition to the MBT domain, SCM contains a C-terminal SPM domain, through which it is thought to interact with PRC1 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Peterson et al., 2004</a>)."

In <i>Drosophila</i>, arrays of DNA motifs recognized by a variety of transcription factors function as recruitment \u2018hubs\u2019 for PRCs and are known as <i>Polycomb</i> responsive elements (PREs) (<a href=\"#bib36\">M\u00fcller and Kassis, 2006</a>); however, PREs alone are not sufficient to explain or predict the genome-wide occupancy patterns of PcG complexes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Simon and Kingston, 2009</a>).

However, the mechanistic details of PRC1 repression in mammals are poorly understood.

SCML2A has a domain organization similar to that of <i>Drosophila</i> SCM: two N-terminal MBT repeats, a DUF3588 domain, and a C-terminal SPM domain. Although both SCML2 isoforms are predominantly nuclear, SCML2A is enriched in the chromatin fraction, whereas the bulk of SCML2B, which lacks the SPM domain is found in the soluble nuclear fraction, where it interacts with the cell cycle machinery and participates in the G1/S checkpoint (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lecona et al., 2013</a>).

Only small traces of PRC1 components could be detected among the SCML2B-associated proteins, despite the fact that a comparable number of SCML2 peptides were detected in the two purifications (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). SCML2A also co-purified with SCMH1 (the other SCM homolog in humans) and L3MBTL3, both of which comprise C-terminal SPM domains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). As a control, both SCML2A and SCML2B recovered comparable amounts of USP7, in good agreement with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sowa et al., 2009</a>) and as we also independently confirmed (Lecona et al. unpublished). In keeping with these observations, immunoprecipitation (IP) of BMI1 from the chromatin fraction of HeLa cells recovered preferentially the chromatin-associated and SPM-containing SCML2A isoform (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, compare top and bottom band in lane 4 vs lane 1 or lane 3)."

Following a strategy we previously described (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kaneko et al., 2013</a>), we generated 293T-REx lines carrying stably integrated, inducible transgenes for human SCML2 fused to a triple N-terminal affinity tag (FLAG-HA-Twin-Strep-tag, henceforth \u2018N3\u2019) and shRNAs against the endogenous <i>SCML2</i>. In these cells, more than 30% (781 out of 2479 total) of SCML2-enriched regions (ERs) were located in the vicinity (&lt;10 kb) of the transcription start site (TSS) of protein-coding genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), consistent with a role for SCML2 in gene regulation. SCML2 targets were significantly enriched for gene ontology (GO) terms related to transcriptional regulation, development, and differentiation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>), as observed for targets of the <i>Polycomb</i> repressive machinery in other systems (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schuettengruber et al., 2007</a>). To determine whether SCML2 shared target genes with PRC1, we also performed ChIP-seq for BMI1 (also known as PCGF4), the key component of canonical PRC1.4 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gao et al., 2012</a>). SCML2 and BMI1 co-occupied several promoters, including those of transcription factors <i>RUNX1</i>, <i>IKZF2</i>, and <i>DMRT1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Overall, SCML2 shared \u223c46% of its target genes with BMI1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>), almost four times more than expected by chance (p=2.5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u2212119</sup>, hypergeometric distribution). This overlap became more pronounced as a function of decreasing p<i>-</i>values for the ERs (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>), suggesting that many of the SCML2-only or BMI1-only sites were false positives due to noise in the ChIP-seq signal. We made similar observations for endogenous SCML2 in non-transgenic K562 cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>), demonstrating that our conclusions can be generalized and do not depend on the presence of the N-terminal tag or on exogenous expression."

Unlike conventional transcription factors, these proteins do not contain a DNA binding domain that directs them to targets on chromatin; instead, there is accumulating evidence that recruitment and regulation of PcG proteins are coordinated by a number of molecular pathways that act in a combinatorial fashion to repress specific genes in different cell types (<a href=\"#bib51\">Simon and Kingston, 2013</a>)."

Here, we have unveiled two mechanisms by which SCML2A contributes to PRC1 function: (1) SCML2 and PRC1 cooperate in chromatin binding, as evidenced by loss of BMI1 upon overexpression of SCML2A<sub>\u0394RBR</sub>, recruitment of BMI1 by SCML2A at artificial tethering sites, and the weak association of SCML2B to chromatin; and (2) SCML2 enforces repression at some target sites independent of the presence of PRC1. In addition, our results show that RNA binding also plays a role in SCML2 function, as it is required for its localization to chromatin."

Genome-wide analyses revealed an extensive overlap of SCML2A target sites with those of BMI1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), suggesting that this interaction is relevant in a chromatin context. Despite the considerable overlap some sites were occupied by SCML2 or BMI1 alone. The former might reflect the complexity of PRC1 subtypes in mammals and the fact that SCML2 is also part of PRC1.2, which does not contain BMI1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gao et al., 2012</a>); the latter is likely due to the higher sensitivity of the BMI1 antibody, although we cannot exclude that some BMI1 target sites are devoid of SCML2. Together with genetic evidence in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib49\">Simon et al., 1992</a>) and mice (<a href=\"#bib56\">Takada et al., 2007</a>), these observations firmly establish SCML2 as an important player in <i>Polycomb</i>-mediated epigenetic regulation. Consistent with this, the SCML2B isoform, which lacks the SPM domain, does not bind to BMI1 and is unable to recruit PRC1 to chromatin (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>); however, when artificially tethered to a chromatinized reporter, SCML2B is still capable to repress it (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), suggesting that SCML2 (and possibly other SCM homologs) might directly enforce gene repression. This notion is further supported by the observation that knockdown for <i>SCML2</i> causes derepression of target genes without affecting BMI1 levels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This PRC1-independent silencing may be mediated by the MBT domain, which binds to methylated histone tails (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grimm et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Santiveri et al., 2008</a>) and, in the case of L3MBTL1, represses transcription via chromatin compaction (<a href=\"#bib58\">Trojer et al., 2007</a>). In fact, the MBT domain of SCM in <i>Drosophila</i> is important for repression (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grimm et al., 2007</a>), and our results show that the MBT domain contributes to the chromatin localization of SCML2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

Despite the fact that the 74-residue fragment containing the RBR is both necessary and sufficient for RNA binding in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1 and 2</a>), prediction algorithms failed to detect known protein folds or the propensity to form secondary structures in this region, suggesting that, in isolation, the RBR remains unstructured. This is not entirely unexpected, considering that induced fit is a common feature of RNA\u2013protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib66\">Williamson, 2000</a>). For example, the fragile X syndrome protein FMR1/FMRP contains an arginine-rich stretch that is disordered in solution but becomes ordered in presence of an RNA ligand (<a href=\"#bib41\">Phan et al., 2011</a>). Although the RBR was dispensable for the interaction with PRC1, its disruption resulted not only in a delocalization of SCML2A from chromatin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), but also in decreased PRC1 occupancy at several target genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This observation is intriguing in view of the fact that short-term <i>SCML2</i> knockdown did not affect BMI1 localization, and suggests that nucleoplasmic SCML2<sub>\u0394RBR</sub>, being still capable of interacting with BMI1 through the SPM domain, might function in a dominant negative fashion, titrating PRC1 away from chromatin."

Despite promiscuous RNA binding in vitro, SCML2\u2013RNA interactions appeared to be specific in vivo, as demonstrated by the following observations: (1) the profile of lincRNAs enriched in the SCML2A WT RIP-seq was unique and distinct from input and control samples (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>); (2) the lincRNAs associated with SCML2 changed upon cellular differentiation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>); and (3) several divergently transcribed ncRNAs were enriched in SCML2 RIPs although the coding mRNAs originating from the same locus were not (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>). The latter also demonstrates that physical proximity on chromatin alone was not the main determinant of SCML2\u2013RNA interactions. Furthermore, the RBR is likely required to mediate the interactions with these RNAs, given that immunoprecipitation of the \u0394RBR mutant recovered less RNA than the WT (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) and that the few detected \u0394RBR-associated RNAs were undistinguishable from those obtained in empty tag-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We propose that the RBR of SCML2A contributes to its recruitment either by interacting with <i>trans-</i>acting RNAs transcribed from distant intergenic loci, or by recognizing <i>cis</i>-acting ncRNAs. The latter may include divergent and overlapping antisense ncRNAs that originate downstream of the TSS, some of which have a demonstrated role in gene regulation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Faghihi and Wahlestedt, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Modarresi et al., 2012</a>), or promoter-associated ncRNAs that originate near the TSS of coding genes and are transcribed from the same strand (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kapranov et al., 2007</a>), similar to the ncRNAs reported to bind PRC2 via SUZ12 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kanhere et al., 2010</a>). We note that despite the examples shown (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>) and several others, we could not detect a significant spatial association between the RIP-seq and ChIP-seq signals at the genome-wide level (data not shown). This might be due to the fact that only a subset of the SCML2-associated ncRNAs act in <i>cis</i> or to the intrinsically noisy nature of the RIP-seq signal. Future studies utilizing improved technologies and/or different cellular and genetic tools will be needed to fully characterize the set of SCML2-associated ncRNAs and their mechanism of action."

We propose that SCML2A is then retained at target genes through the interaction with PRC1 and that, in turn, SCML2A contributes to stabilizing PRC1. We also report that, at a subset of genes, SCML2 appears to enforce repression directly, independent of PRC1 recruitment, via mechanisms that remain to be elucidated."

This figure also allows the direct comparison between the levels of exogenous and endogenous SCML2, as both types of protein are detected by the SCML2 antibody.
