We tested whether environmental shifts in oxygen tension lead to events in the adult newt brain that share features with processes occurring during neuronal regeneration under normoxia. By experimental simulation of varying oxygen concentrations, we show that hypoxia followed by re-oxygenation lead to neuronal death and hallmarks of an injury response, including activation of neural stem cells ultimately leading to neurogenesis. Neural stem cells accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) during re-oxygenation and inhibition of ROS biosynthesis counteracts their proliferation as well as neurogenesis. Importantly, regeneration of dopamine neurons under normoxia also depends on ROS-production. These data demonstrate a role for ROS-production in neurogenesis in newts and suggest that this role may have been recruited to the capacity to replace lost neurons in the brain of an adult vertebrate."

We tested whether environmental shifts in oxygen tension lead to events in the adult newt brain that share features with processes occurring during neuronal regeneration under normoxia. By experimental simulation of varying oxygen concentrations, we show that hypoxia followed by re-oxygenation lead to neuronal death and hallmarks of an injury response, including activation of neural stem cells ultimately leading to neurogenesis. Neural stem cells accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) during re-oxygenation and inhibition of ROS biosynthesis counteracts their proliferation as well as neurogenesis. Importantly, regeneration of dopamine neurons under normoxia also depends on ROS-production. These data demonstrate a role for ROS-production in neurogenesis in newts and suggest that this role may have been recruited to the capacity to replace lost neurons in the brain of an adult vertebrate."

The oxygen levels under the ice tend to drop and so the newts adjust their metabolism to cope with these conditions.

These molecules form naturally as a by-product of oxygen metabolism, but in high quantities they can damage cells and tissues."

These species are in general capable of adjusting their metabolic rate and to cope with the accumulation of anaerobic by-products (<a href=\"#bib24\">Larson et al., 2014</a>). Re-oxygenation upon return to normoxia may lead to the production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS), and it has been proposed that these animals need to repair tissues that might become damaged during re-oxygenation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bickler and Buck, 2007</a>). In this article, we set out to test this latter hypothesis in the highly regenerative aquatic salamander, the red-spotted newt.

Ependymoglia cells line the brain ventricles, express the intermediate filament protein GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), and have radial extensions, reaching the pial surface (<a href=\"#bib31\">Parish et al., 2007</a>). Regeneration in homeostatically non-germinal niches is independent of the normal constitutive neurogenesis occurring in the forebrain (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kirkham et al., 2014</a>), thus the newt brain is an ideal model for studying both constitutive and injury-induced adult neurogenesis, as well as the relationship between the two."

We find that modulation of oxygen tension leads to loss of neurons, activation of microglia, accumulation of ROS in ependymoglia cells concomitant with their cell cycle reentry, and increased neurogenesis in the forebrain. Inhibition of microglia activation does not abolish ependymoglia activation upon re-oxygenation, and NSCs cultured as neurospheres respond by increased proliferation in vitro, both observations indicating a cell autonomous role for ROS in NSCs. We further show that ROS production is required for cell cycle reentry by ependymoglia cells as well as for neuronal regeneration in the normally quiescent midbrain also during normoxia. Thus, we show that ROS production is an important component of NSC regulation and propose that this role of ROS may have been recruited during evolution to the capacity of regenerating neuronal subpopulations."

We tested various regimens of shifting oxygen tension and found that newts were able to cope with hypoxic conditions as low as 10% of the normal oxygen tension provided that the decrease was gradual over a period of 48 hr. Hence, animals were kept in 10% of the normal oxygen tension for five days, and brought subsequently back instantly to normoxic conditions, and analyzed at different time points (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

To determine whether neurons are lost during hypoxia/re-oxygenation, we carried out double immunostaining for the pan-neuronal marker NeuN and TUNEL.

To do so, we ablated midbrain dopamine neurons by injecting the neurotoxin, 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine), without applying the hypoxia/re-oxygenation protocol. We previously showed that, in contrast to the forebrain, the newt midbrain is non-germinal and essentially quiescent (<a href=\"#bib31\">Parish et al., 2007</a>). However, after administration of 6-OHDA, which kills dopamine neurons in the midbrain within 3 days after injection, newts regenerate lost midbrain dopamine neurons within four weeks. Regeneration is fuelled by the local activation of normally non-proliferating ependymoglia cells, which subsequently undergo a neurogenic program (<a href=\"#bib31\">Parish et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berg et al., 2010</a>). First, we noticed that injection of 6-OHDA led to accumulation of ROS in ependymoglia cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Next, we tested whether inhibition of ROS biosynthesis during the regeneration phase interfered with the ablation-responsive cell cycle reentry by ependymoglia cells, by treating animals with apocynin for five days starting from day 4 post-ablation. We found a 3.3-fold reduction in the number of proliferating ependymoglia cells in apocynin- vs control-injected animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). In addition, while apocynin treatment alone did not reduce the number of TH (Tyrosine Hydroxylase)-expressing neurons in sham-lesioned control (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), apocynin inhibited regeneration of dopamine neurons after 6-OHDA-injection assessed by a reduction in the number of midbrain neurons expressing TH (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). These data show that injury responsive ependymoglia proliferation and neuronal regeneration depends on ROS production also during normoxia."

However, conflicting data exist as to whether ROS impairs or contributes to normal stem cell function (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kim and Wong, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chuikov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dickinson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Le Belle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Walton et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). We used systemic manipulation of oxygen tension as a means to manipulate ROS levels in a naturally regenerating organism. In contrast to most previous studies, which were heavily based on mixed cultures of stem and progenitor cells, we here took advantage of the fact that the vast majority of the ependymoglia cells lining the ventricles of the adult newt brain are rarely dividing stem cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kirkham et al., 2014</a>). Our data support the view that increased ROS signaling is important for the activation of NSCs, ultimately leading to replacement of lost neurons."

Specifically, it has been suggested that mitochondrial- and NOX-derived ROS play opposing roles in NSC and progenitor cell proliferation with mitochondria-derived ROS inhibiting and NOX-derived ROS promoting proliferation of neural progenitor proliferation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hou et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Prozorovski et al., 2015</a>). In the newt brain however, mitochondrially targeted antioxidant administration neither increased nor reduced the proliferation of ependymoglia cells, although it apparently reduced mitochondrial ROS accumulation following re-oxygenation. This is in sharp contrast to the effect we found upon NOX inhibition. Since inhibiting NOX-derived ROS production counteracted re-oxygenation induced proliferation, our data indicate a dominating role for NOX-derived ROS in the control of ependymolgia cell proliferation. Other studies showed ROS accumulation in newly formed neurons, indicating a function in neuronal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tsatmali et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Tsatmali et al., 2005</a>). While we could not evaluate the effect of ROS production on neuronal differentiation in vivo, our assessment did not show any increase in ROS levels in young neurons compared to NSCs in vitro. Although these observations do not demonstrate that ROS signaling is not important for differentiation, the results indicate that differentiation of neurons does not require increased ROS production."

Completely faithful recapitulation of such constrains is not possible under laboratory conditions, not the least due to the variability of such events in nature. However, our findings are consistent with the model suggesting that shifts between hypoxic and normoxic conditions cause tissue damage (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bickler and Buck, 2007</a>). We can conclude that return to physiological oxygen tension from hypoxia leads to injury response in the newt brain, shown by loss of neurons, microglia activation, cell cycle reentry by NSCs, and increased neurogenesis. Importantly, increased ROS levels are also detectable in NSCs not only after re-oxygenation but also during replacement of midbrain dopamine neurons during constantly normoxic condition. Hence, it is plausible that ROS-production in NSC has been co-opted to the capacity of replacing lost neuronal population in the newt brain. It should also be pointed out that many hypoxia tolerant vertebrates are good regenerators. Two examples for this are zebrafish and crucian carp, both of which having marked brain regeneration capacity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kirsche and Kirsche, 1961</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wolburg and Bouzehouane, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kroehne et al., 2011</a>). Zebrafish, which live in tropical waters known to become hypoxic during nighttime, is able to survive at low levels of oxygen for days and the crucian carp remains active for months in anoxic water (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nilsson and Renshaw, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chu et al., 2010</a>).

The seemingly random, phylogenetically uneven distribution of animals capable of regenerating multiple structures in their bodies suggests that a regeneration capacity of an organism on such scale could be a purely ancestral phenomenon, which has been lost in most species for reasons that are unclear at present (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sanchez Alvarado, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Simon and Tanaka, 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "Nevertheless, specific micro-evolutionary selection mechanisms, such as loss of neurons during hypoxia/re-oxygenation as we demonstrate in the present work, may contribute to how an inherent regeneration capacity is manifested or whether it is manifested at all. Several recent findings support this view. First, closely related salamander species have non-overlapping range of regeneration capacities. For example, adult newts but not axolotls are able to regenerate the lens of the eye (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grogg et al., 2005</a>). Similarly, some planarian species have more extensive regeneration capacities than others (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sikes and Newmark, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Umesono et al., 2013</a>). Second, we found that axolotls and newts display key cellular and molecular differences during limb regeneration (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sandoval-Guzman et al., 2014</a>). Third, it has been shown that a central molecular component of salamander limb regeneration, Prod1, is only found in the salamander genome (<a href=\"#bib13\">Garza-Garcia et al., 2010</a>) suggesting local evolution of limb regeneration in salamanders. Fourth, work on pectoral fin regeneration in zebrafish revealed an intriguing example of a sex-specific obstruction of regeneration, likely due to interference with a signaling pathway maintaining key secondary sexual attributes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kang et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "In a cross-species comparative setting, it is also noteworthy that cell cycle reentry by NSCs appears to be dependent on accumulation of inflammatory cells and microglia activation in the zebrafish brain (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kyritsis et al., 2012</a>). The hypoxia/re-oxygenation experimental paradigm that we employed does not provide evidence for such an interaction in the newt brain and our data rather suggest a cell autonomous process. Although the experimental manipulations used in zebrafish and in the newt brain here are different from each other, and we cannot rule out the possibility that microglia could activate NSCs in the newt brain under certain conditions, our observations indicate that the two animal species embark on at least partially non-overlapping signaling mechanism during neuronal regeneration."

The authors first show that neuronal death and ependymoglia proliferation occur during the reoxigenation phase during hypoxia and then proceed to demonstrate that ROS levels increase in the ependymoglia during this time. More importantly, the authors show that by interfering with ROS activity, they can experimentally and significantly reduce both ependymoglia proliferation and the ensuing neurogenesis to replace dead neurons. Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the work presented in the manuscript is the evidence that ROS levels are also elevated in the 6OHDA model killing dopaminergic neurons and required also here for regenerative neurogenesis. In sum, the work reveals an important role for ROS levels during regenerative neurogenesis with will likely be of great significance in studies of regeneration of various organs in other organisms, including mammals."

To detect mitochondrial ROS we injected animals with the mitochondrial superoxide indicator Mitosox and could conclude that animals that underwent hypoxia/re-oxygenation displayed accumulation of mitochondrial ROS compared to control animals. This accumulation could be blocked by administration of the mitochondrially targeted antioxidant, Mitotempo. However, in contrast to the effect of NOX-inhibition with apocynin, Mitotempo administration did not reduce the number of PCNA<sup>+ </sup>ependymoglia cells. Thus our data indicate a dominating role for NOX derived ROS in the control of ependymoglia cell proliferation.

Unfortunately most animals did not tolerate the number of sequential injections required for this study and hence these experiments could not be evaluated. The suggested alternative way to address this question using the 6-OHDA mediated ablation model is unfortunately not feasible because the proliferation and differentiation phases are not temporally distinct during regeneration. Differentiation of TH neurons occurs gradually over time rather than in a separate burst after an initial proliferation phase. This precludes us to disentangle differentiation and proliferation from each other in a temporal dimension. However, as an indirect way we measured ROS levels in GFAP<sup>+</sup> NSCs and Dcx<sup>+</sup> young neurons and did not detect a difference comparing the two cell types. Although these observations do not demonstrate that ROS signaling is not important for differentiation, the results indicate that differentiation of neurons does not require increased ROS production. The data are shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a> and described in the Results, subsection \u201cEpendymoglia cell proliferation and neurogenesis following re-oxygenation depends on ROS production\u201d."

In some conditions the authors chose direct incorporation of nucleotides as a clear measure of cell-cycle reentry, while in others they use PCNA immunostaining.

We have previously shown (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berg et al., 2010</a>; Development) that PCNA staining and EdU pulsing give with each other consistent results regarding ependymoglia proliferation. In addition, as a proof of principle in the context of the present study, we performed EdU pulse experiments during re-oxygenation and compared the results with data obtained from PCNA staining. Importantly, there was no difference in the conclusions from the two types of measurements, as both PCNA staining and EdU pulsing indicated a 1.8 increase in ependymoglia proliferation upon re-oxygenation compared to control animals. These data are presented in the <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a> and are referred to in Results (in the subsection \u201cRe-oxygenation leads to cell cycle reentry by forebrain ependymoglia cells and increased neurogenesis\u201d)."
