The molecules and reactions that drive these dynamics in vivo are not well understood. In this study, we present evidence that a group of intrinsically disordered, serine-rich proteins regulate the dynamics of P granules in <i>C. elegans</i> embryos. The MEG (maternal-effect germline defective) proteins are germ plasm components that are required redundantly for fertility. We demonstrate that MEG-1 and MEG-3 are substrates of the kinase MBK-2/DYRK and the phosphatase PP2A<sup>PPTR\u2212\u00bd</sup>. Phosphorylation of the MEGs promotes granule disassembly and dephosphorylation promotes granule assembly. Using lattice light sheet microscopy on live embryos, we show that GFP-tagged MEG-3 localizes to a dynamic domain that surrounds and penetrates each granule. We conclude that, despite their liquid-like behavior, P granules are non-homogeneous structures whose assembly in embryos is regulated by phosphorylation."

The molecules and reactions that drive these dynamics in vivo are not well understood. In this study, we present evidence that a group of intrinsically disordered, serine-rich proteins regulate the dynamics of P granules in <i>C. elegans</i> embryos. The MEG (maternal-effect germline defective) proteins are germ plasm components that are required redundantly for fertility. We demonstrate that MEG-1 and MEG-3 are substrates of the kinase MBK-2/DYRK and the phosphatase PP2A<sup>PPTR\u2212\u00bd</sup>. Phosphorylation of the MEGs promotes granule disassembly and dephosphorylation promotes granule assembly. Using lattice light sheet microscopy on live embryos, we show that GFP-tagged MEG-3 localizes to a dynamic domain that surrounds and penetrates each granule. We conclude that, despite their liquid-like behavior, P granules are non-homogeneous structures whose assembly in embryos is regulated by phosphorylation."

In most cells, RNA molecules concentrate into aggregates called RNA granules. These granules contain both RNA and proteins that bind to RNA and are used to transport, store, and regulate the translation and breakdown of RNA molecules. Unlike many other structures within cells, RNA granules are not surrounded by a membrane; and the molecules that hold RNA granules together are not known."

When a <i>C. elegans</i> embryo is still a single cell, P granules move throughout the cell and the P granules at the front of the cell dissolve, while those at the back condense. As such, when the single-celled embryo divides, the front forms a cell without P granules (that will go on to form the tissues of the worm's body) and the back becomes a P granule-containing germ cell."

MBK-2 is an enzyme that adds phosphate groups onto other proteins, whereas PPTR-1 is part of an enzyme that removes such groups. Wang et al. have now searched for proteins that interact with MBK-2 and PPTR-1 in order to identify the molecules that regulate the assembly of P granules. They found that a group of proteins, known as MEG proteins, are acted upon by both of these proteins. Wang et al. found that MBK-2 adds phosphate groups to MEG proteins, which encourages granules to disassemble, while PPTR-1 removes these groups to promote granule assembly."

Without MEG proteins, P granules failed to assemble or disassemble normally and the worms were infertile. Using high resolution microscopy, Wang et al. observed that the MEG proteins wrap around the P granules and that one of the MEG proteins\u2014called MEG-3\u2014follows an almost ribbon-like path that surrounds and enters each granule. These observations suggest that the MEG proteins stabilize RNA granules by forming a cage-like scaffold around each granule. How the MEG proteins\u2014which are predicted to lack a fixed or ordered three-dimensional structure and show no similarity to proteins with known functions\u2014assemble into a scaffold will be the focus of future studies."

Several types of RNA granules have been described, including germ granules in germ cells, neuronal granules in neurons, and stress granules and P bodies in somatic cells. Their functions include mRNA transport and storage and the regulation of mRNA degradation and translation. Unlike other organelles, RNA granules are not bound by limiting membranes and their internal components are in constant flux with the surrounding cytoplasm. RNA granules assemble and disassemble in response to developmental or environmental cues (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kedersha et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Buchan, 2014</a>). Live imaging studies in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> zygotes have suggested that RNA granules behave like liquid droplets that undergo phase transitions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brangwynne et al., 2009</a>). Granule components exist in a condensed liquid or gel-like phase in the granule and a dispersed phase in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib55\">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Toretsky and Wright, 2014</a>). In vitro studies have lent support to this hypothesis by demonstrating that purified proteins can undergo phase transitions in aqueous solutions. For example, proteins that contain weak, multivalent protein-binding domains undergo liquid\u2013liquid demixing in concentrated solutions to form micron-sized droplets (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, RNA-binding proteins that contain low sequence-complexity domains assemble into ordered fibers that coalesce into hydrogels when maintained at low temperature (<a href=\"#bib12\">Frey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kato et al., 2012</a>). The proteins that drive the phase transitions in vivo, however, are not known. Several proteins and RNAs are required for granule integrity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buchan, 2014</a>), and recently the kinase DYRK3 has been implicated in the regulation of stress granule dissolution and condensation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wippich et al., 2013</a>). In the present study, we identify the substrates of the <i>C. elegans</i> DYRK3 homolog MBK-2 and demonstrate that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of these substrates drive the dissolution and condensation of P granules in embryos."

P granules are perinuclear during most of the germline development. During the oocyte-to-embryo transition, P granules detach from nuclei and disperse in the cytoplasm for asymmetric segregation to the nascent embryonic germline. Preferential dissolution of the granules in the anterior and condensation in the posterior of the zygote cause the granules to accumulate in the cytoplasm destined for the germline blastomere P<sub>1</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brangwynne et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gallo et al., 2010</a>). P granules segregate asymmetrically for three more divisions until the P granules are uniquely concentrated in the germline founder cell P<sub>4</sub> (<a href=\"#bib44\">Strome and Wood, 1983</a>). Two groups of RNA-binding proteins form the core components of P granules: the RGG domain proteins PGL-1 and PGL-3 and the Vasa-related helicases GLH-1, 2, 3, and 4 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Updike and Strome, 2010</a>). A self-association domain in the PGL family is essential for granule nucleation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hanazawa et al., 2011</a>), and FG repeats in GLH-1 are required for P granules to associate with nuclei (<a href=\"#bib51\">Updike et al., 2011</a>)."

(2009)</a>. MBK-2 could phosphorylate MBP::MEG-1 and MBP::MEG-3, but not MBP alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Using the DYRK consensus site K/R X<sub>1\u20133</sub> S/T P (<a href=\"#bib21\">Himpel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Campbell and Proud, 2002</a>), we identified putative consensus sites in MEG-1 (S574) and MEG-3 (T541, S582, T605). S574 in MEG-1 is reported as a phosphorylated site in Phosida (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gnad et al., 2007</a>). We mutated each consensus site to alanine and repeated the kinase assays. Phosphorylation was reduced but not eliminated in the alanine mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We conclude that recombinant MBK-2 phosphorylates MEG-1 and MEG-3 on consensus sites in vitro, as well as other sites that remain to be determined."

We detected one primary species for both GFP::MEG-1 and GFP::MEG-3 and several higher molecular weight species that did not resolve well into specific bands. Treatment with alkaline phosphatase eliminated the higher molecular weight species and increased the intensity of the lower species (unphosphorylated isoform, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The relative abundance of the unphosphorylated isoform increased in lysates depleted of <i>mbk-2</i> and decreased in lysates depleted of <i>pptr-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). We conclude that MEG-1 and MEG-3 are phosphoproteins in vivo and that MBK-2 and PPTR-1 promote and antagonize, respectively, their phosphorylation. Under all conditions, GFP::MEG-1 and GFP::MEG-3 still migrated as a mixture of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated isoforms. Because our assays were done in lysates that were depleted for MBK-2 by RNAi, and lysates that lacked PPTR-1 but retained PPTR-2, we do not know whether MBK-2 and PP2A<sup>PPTR\u22121/2</sup> are the only regulators of MEG-1 and MEG-3 phosphorylation or whether other kinases and phosphatases are also involved."

We observed the strongest phenotype in the double mutant. First, we noticed that disassembly of oocyte granules was incomplete in <i>meg-3 meg-4</i> zygotes (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), causing a few oocyte granules to persist through the first mitotic division (arrows in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). During mitosis, a few new granules appeared in the posterior cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), but these remained small (&lt;1 micron) and most were not maintained during the division (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). As a result, the total number of granules (including oocyte granules) in <i>meg-3 meg-4</i> zygotes in mitosis was \u223c11% that of wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In the 2-cell stage, new small granules formed again transiently in P<sub>1</sub>, but again these were fewer and smaller than in wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This pattern was repeated at each division such that by the 28-cell stage, only a few scattered granules were observed throughout the embryo, with no detectable enrichment in the germline founder cell P<sub>4</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We observed the same P granule dynamics when staining <i>meg-3 meg-4</i> zygotes with an antibody against another P granule component, the Vasa-homolog GLH-2 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). <i>meg-3 meg-4</i> zygotes showed similar levels of overall GFP:PGL-1 fluorescence compared to wild-type and similar levels of PGL-3 by western blot analysis (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>).

In wild-type, during each asymmetric division of the germline P blastomeres, the P granule-associated RNA <i>nos-2</i> segregates preferentially with the P granules (asymmetric segregation) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Subramaniam and Seydoux, 1999</a>). The lower levels inherited by the somatic daughter are turned over after division (degradation). In <i>meg-3 meg-4</i> zygotes, we found that <i>nos-2</i> RNA was distributed equally to P blastomeres and their somatic sisters, consistent with the lack of stable P granules. <i>nos-2</i> RNA, however, was still quickly degraded in the somatic blastomeres after division as in wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Thus, as previously reported for <i>pptr-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gallo et al., 2010</a>), despite symmetric segregation of <i>nos-2</i> RNA, an inherent asymmetry between somatic and germline blastomeres in <i>meg</i>-3 <i>meg-4</i> embryos causes <i>nos-2</i> RNA to be maintained only in the germline blastomeres. Loss of <i>meg-3</i> and <i>meg-4</i> also did not affect the formation of P bodies (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) nor the distribution of asymmetric proteins that segregate independently of P granules (PIE-1 and MEX-5) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). By the L1 larval stage, when new P granule components are synthesized in the PGCs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kawasaki et al., 2004</a>), low levels of perinuclear P granules became visible in the primordial germ cells of <i>meg-3 meg-4</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). By the L4 larval stage, P granule levels were indistinguishable from wild-type in fertile <i>meg-3 meg-4</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). We conclude that MEG-3 and MEG-4 are only required for P granule assembly in pre-gastrulation embryos and are not required for other soma/germline asymmetries, or for the assembly of P bodies or perinuclear P granules."

To avoid potential artifacts from fixation, we turned to lattice light sheet microscopy, a new method that uses ultra-thin light sheets derived from optical lattices to image 3D volumes with high temporal and spatial resolution (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2014</a>). Imaging of live zygotes co-expressing GFP::MEG-3 and mCherry:PGL-3 revealed that both were non-uniformly distributed and constantly rearranged within the granules (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). The GFP::MEG-3 and mCherry::PGL-3 signals overlapped but were never perfectly coincident, even during granule fusion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). In 34 of 37 granules analyzed, the GFP::MEG-3 signal extended over a larger area than the mCherry::PGL-3 signal (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), with GFP::MEG-3 extending further out at the periphery of each granule compared to mCherry::PGL-3."

The single time point SIM images confirmed that GFP::MEG-3 is not uniformly distributed in the granules. The non-uniform pattern of GFP::MEG-3 was also visible in raw, unprocessed images (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). In 5 out of 5 granules reconstructed in SIM mode, GFP::MEG-3 localized to a discontinuous ribbon-like domain that surrounded and penetrated the granule (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Videos 6 and 7</a>).

We suggest that this transition depends on scaffolding of new granules by MEG assemblies throughout the cytoplasm. We propose that, shortly after fertilization, MEG assemblies promote PGL condensation, depleting the cytoplasmic PGL-1 pool available to maintain oocyte granules and causing PGL-1 to redistribute from oocyte granules to MEG-scaffolded zygote granules. In <i>meg</i> mutants, this competition does not take place, allowing oocyte granules to persist longer. The alternative possibility that the primary role of the MEGs is to disassemble oocyte granules, which indirectly is required for zygote granule assembly, is unlikely since (1) the <i>meg-3</i> single mutant disassembles oocyte granules, yet is still partially defective in zygote granule assembly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), (2) <i>mbk-2</i>, which is required for the disassembly of zygote granules, is not required for the disassembly of oocyte granules (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and (3) oocyte granules represent less than 1% of the total PGL-1 pool available in <i>meg-3 meg-4</i> zygotes, so their mere presence is unlikely to interfere with the assembly of new granules (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). We detected GFP::MEG-3 in the cytoplasm of oocytes before fertilization, yet loss of <i>meg-3</i> does not affect oocyte granules until after fertilization. We do not know what cue activates the scaffolding function of MEG proteins specifically in zygotes."

Unlike the RNA-binding proteins that associate with hydrogels in vitro (<a href=\"#bib12\">Frey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kato et al., 2012</a>), the MEGs do not contain a recognizable RNA-binding domain or short repeated motifs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The MEGs contain, however, extended regions with predicted high disorder (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Intrinsically disordered proteins have been shown to oligomerize and organize scaffolds that template supramolecular structures (<a href=\"#bib49\">Turoverov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Toretsky and Wright, 2014</a>). For example, ameloblastin self-assembles in vitro into ribbons that can extend to hundreds of nanometers in length (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wald et al., 2013</a>). In vivo, ameloblastin is essential for the organization of enamel matrix proteins during teeth biomineralization. MEG-1 and MEG-3 bind directly to PGL-1 in vitro, consistent with a role in organizing PGL-1 assemblies. When over-expressed in mammalian cells, PGL-1 can assemble granules on its own (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hanazawa et al., 2011</a>). In <i>meg-3 meg-4</i> zygotes, a few small PGL-1 granules form transiently in the posterior cytoplasm but are not maintained. We suggest that, in zygotes, the self-assembly properties of PGL-1 are only sufficient to form small, unstable granules, which must be stabilized by a MEG-dependent scaffold. Our observations using light sheet microscopy indicate that MEG-3 localizes to small assemblies in the cytoplasm and larger assemblies surrounding a PGL core in the P granules. During granule disassembly, MEG-3 and MEG-4 assemblies persist longer than the PGL-1 core, consistent with occupying a distinct domain. Together these observations suggest the following working model: the MEGs promote granule assembly by forming dynamic scaffolds in the cytoplasm that stabilize and wrap around PGL condensates."

Our observations suggest that embryonic P granules in fact contain distinct surface and internal zones, as also reported for post-embryonic, perinuclear P granules (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pitt et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sheth et al., 2010</a>). Nucleoli, which also behave like liquid droplets, also contain a distinct surface shell (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brangwynne et al., 2011</a>). Nucleoli, however, are perfect spheres (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brangwynne et al., 2011</a>), whereas P granules are imperfect spheres with irregular, asymmetric contours that are constantly in flux. We suggest that this difference is due to the fact that P granules are undergoing continuous exchange with smaller assemblies in the surrounding cytoplasm. Consistent with this possibility, photobleaching experiments have demonstrated rapid exchange of GFP::PGL-1 and GFP::MEG-3 between granules and cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brangwynne et al., 2009</a> and data not shown). We conclude that P granules in embryos are not stable, homogeneous droplets, but dynamic assemblies of two (or more) condensates that mix only partially and are constantly in flux with smaller assemblies in the cytoplasm."

The MEGs are rich in serines (75 serines in MEG-1 and 119 serines in MEG-3), and their migration on Phos-tag gels suggests a complex pattern of phosphorylation with many phosphoisoforms. Initial attempts to mutate individual serines in MEG-1 and MEG-3 have not yielded detectable phenotypes, suggesting that the serines may function cumulatively (data not shown). Accumulation of negatively charged phosphates could interfere with the interactions that stabilize the MEG scaffold or its interactions with PGL-1. Consistent with this possibility, phosphorylation of the low complexity domain of the FUS stress granule protein interferes with its incorporation into hydrogels in vitro (<a href=\"#bib18\">Han et al., 2012</a>). Our genetic analyses suggest that all MEGs contribute to assembly and disassembly but to different extents, with MEG-3 and MEG-4 together making the most important contribution to assembly. The predicted pI (isoelectric point) of MEG-1 and MEG-2 in the unphosphorylated state is 6.63 and 6.04, compared to 9.74 and 9.33 for MEG-3 and MEG-4. We speculate that the intrinsic negative charge of MEG-1 and MEG-2, which is increased further by phosphorylation, favors a role for these proteins in disassembly. In contrast, the intrinsic weak positive charge of MEG-3 and MEG-4 allows them to contribute robustly to both disassembly and assembly, as they switch to negative and back to positive upon phosphorylation and dephosphorylation."

At the onset of disassembly, MBK-2/DYRK is enriched in the anterior half of the zygote (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pellettieri et al., 2003</a>). If dephosphorylation by PP2A continuously antagonizes phosphorylation by MBK-2, even small changes in the level of MBK-2 levels along the anterior/posterior axis could bias MEG phosphorylation and P granule disassembly. Paradoxically, MBK-2/DYRK also accumulates in P granules, especially late in the first cell cycle as the granules continue to grow in the posterior cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pellettieri et al., 2003</a>). Interestingly, DYRK3, the vertebrate homolog of MBK-2 that regulates stress granule dynamics, also localizes in the granules (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wippich et al., 2013</a>). Drug inhibition studies suggest that DYRK3 enhances granule condensation when its kinase activity is inhibited and promotes granule dissolution when activated (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wippich et al., 2013</a>). An attractive possibility is that, as P granules increase in size, MBK-2 activity decreases within the granule, perhaps due to the accumulation of an inhibitor. Interestingly, GFP::PPTR-1 also becomes enriched in P granules in zygotes (data not shown). There are also other asymmetries in the zygote cytoplasm that could bias P granule dynamics. GFP::MEG-3 forms an anterior-low/posterior-high gradient along the length of the zygote, and the RNA-binding protein MEX-5, which is required for full disassembly, forms an opposing gradient with higher levels in the anterior (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schubert et al., 2000</a>). Modeling studies have already demonstrated that, in principle, even weak gradients of phase transition regulators are sufficient to segregate P granules (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee et al., 2013</a>). It will be important to determine which asymmetry in the zygote cytoplasm is directly responsible for patterning P granule dynamics."

Germ plasm is thought to have evolved independently several times during metazoan evolution (<a href=\"#bib11\">Extavour and Akam, 2003</a>), and the molecules that initiate germ plasm and/or germ granule assembly in eggs are not conserved between different species, although some contain intrinsically disordered regions (e.g., Bucky Ball/Xvelo in vertebrates, MEGs in <i>C. elegans</i>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Marlow and Mullins, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bontems et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nijjar and Woodland, 2013</a>). In all species examined, the germ plasm contains microscopically visible P granule-like structures that are enriched for conserved mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins required for germ cell development (e.g., <i>nanos</i> RNA and VASA-related helicases) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Voronina et al., 2011</a>).

In contrast, the perinuclear P granules that form in primordial germ cells and their descendents are required for fertility (<a href=\"#bib50\">Updike and Strome, 2010</a>). Consistent with that view, fertile <i>meg</i> mutants that do not assemble P granules in the germ plasm assemble perinuclear P granules de novo later in development. De novo assembly of perinuclear germ granules is also observed in animals that do not inherit germ plasm and specify their primordial germ cells through inductive mechanisms later in development (<a href=\"#bib53\">Voronina et al., 2011</a>)."

Most of the players have been previously described: MBK-2 kinase is needed for P granule disassembly, PP2A phosphatase (PPTR-1, 2) is needed for P granule assembly/stability, and MEG-1 and MEG-2 are needed for P granule segregation in early embryos and for fertility. By screening for proteins that interact with PPTR-1 in yeast 2-hybrid, Wang et al. additionally identified GEI-11/MEG-3 and MEG-4. They showed that a) MEG-1,3,4 directly interact with PPTR-1,2 and also with the P granule component PGL-1, b) MEG-1 and MEG-3 are phosphorylated by MBK-2 in vitro, c) MEG-1 and MEG-3 are phospho-proteins in vivo and the abundance of their phosphorylated forms is influenced by MBK-2 and PPTR-1. Analysis of double and triple mutants showed that MBK-2 is epistatic to PPTR-1, 2, and the MEGs are epistatic to both. MEG-3, 4 function redundantly to promote P granule assembly. The model is that MBK-2 and MEG phosphorylation promote P granule disassembly in the anterior cytoplasm, and PPTR-1, 2 and MEG dephosphorylation promote P granule assembly in the posterior cytoplasm destined for the germline blastomeres. The MEG proteins are predicted to be largely disordered and based on high resolution imaging of MEG-3 in live embryos using lattice light sheet microscopy, the authors propose the MEGs form a scaffold that surrounds and penetrates the P granules and that regulates P granule dynamics."

This is followed by acknowledging that normal looking P granules do actually reform in larval and adult meg-3 meg-4 animals. A more appropriate conclusion would be that P granules ARE required for fertility in adults, but that assembly of large P granules in early embryos is not required to specify the primordial germ cells, similar to their conclusions for pptr-1.

There is a fair amount of \u201cstructure\u201d apparent within the P granules. This is particularly obvious in the largest granule at the center of the image, which looks a bit like popcorn. There is apparently structure within the granules, which exists on a characteristic length scale of \u223c200 nm. The problem is that if one looks at regions of the cytoplasm that does not contain granules, there is also structure on this length scale. Why is that? The mottled pattern seen both in granules and in the cytoplasm is quite reminiscent of the patterns one gets after running e.g. a Gaussian bandpass filter through unstructured white noise images, or after running deconvolution algorithms on unstructured images (I just did this for a random, white noise image and the result of applying a Gaussian bandpass filter looks, qualitatively, very similar to the mottled patterns you show; however, I can't seem to figure out how to upload an image with this review...). This is very relevant because for at least some of the light sheet images shown, there is a deconvolution algorithm being employed, where care needs to be taken to avoid artifacts. Do you see structure like that seen in the P granules when you use this technique to image a homogenous solution of dye? If you use this technique to image micron-sized fluorescent spherical particles, for which the embedded dye is presumably uniformly distributed within the particle, does it come out looking like popcorn? (is this also true if the particle is \u201cpre-bleached\u201d so that the fluorophores density is comparable to what one might expect for an average GFP density in the granule?). For these reasons, it is difficult for me to put any weight on arguments made about both the internal structure of the granules, and the idea that they are highly non-spherical on these length scales. Since the authors make such a big deal about the non-homogenity of the granules (e.g. last sentence of the abstract), this seems important to nail down."

The work is intriguing and most of the data presented are convincing, but the study seems incomplete in several respects. First, it is not clear why the authors chose to analyze some mutants or combinations of mutants and not others. For example, why is the meg-4 mutant omitted? In the analysis of triple mutants, why isn't the phenotype of meg-1/2/3 or meg-2/3/4 shown? The localization analysis is one of the strengths of the paper but is limited to MEG-3 protein; the conclusions would be greatly enhanced by the analysis of other MEGs and, ideally, a combination of two different MEGs differentially labeled with GFP and Cherry. Second, the paper seems to stop short of a critical experiment, analyzing the dynamics of MEG-3 (or other MEG protein) in mbk-2 and pptr-1 mutants or even the distribution in wildtype animals during disassembly. A second major concern is that meg-3 meg-4 mutant animals are fertile despite the fact P1 has very few P granules and none are apparent in P4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), which makes me question the importance of these genes and the P granule assembly process."

There is a fair amount of \u201cstructure\u201d apparent within the P granules. This is particularly obvious in the largest granule at the center of the image, which looks a bit like popcorn. There is apparently structure within the granules, which exists on a characteristic length scale of \u223c200 nm. The problem is that if one looks at regions of the cytoplasm that does not contain granules, there is also structure on this length scale. Why is that? The mottled pattern seen both in granules and in the cytoplasm is quite reminiscent of the patterns one gets after running e.g. a Gaussian bandpass filter through unstructured white noise images, or after running deconvolution algorithms on unstructured images (I just did this for a random, white noise image and the result of applying a Gaussian bandpass filter looks, qualitatively, very similar to the mottled patterns you show; however, I can't seem to figure out how to upload an image with this review...). This is very relevant because for at least some of the light sheet images shown, there is a deconvolution algorithm being employed, where care needs to be taken to avoid artifacts. Do you see structure like that seen in the P granules when you use this technique to image a homogenous solution of dye? If you use this technique to image micron-sized fluorescent spherical particles, for which the embedded dye is presumably uniformly distributed within the particle, does it come out looking like popcorn? (is this also true if the particle is \u201cpre-bleached\u201d so that the fluorophores density is comparable to what one might expect for an average GFP density in the granule?). For these reasons, it is difficult for me to put any weight on arguments made about both the internal structure of the granules, and the idea that they are highly non-spherical on these length scales. Since the authors make such a big deal about the non-homogenity of the granules (e.g. last sentence of the abstract), this seems important to nail down</i>."

Since we cannot visualize all isoforms on gels, we based all of our quantitative analyses on the non\u2010phosphorylated form of MEG\u20101 and MEG\u20103, which runs as a clear single band in all the experiments. By comparing the abundance of this band on Phos\u2010tag versus non\u2010Phos\u2010tag gels, we estimate the degree of phosphorylation in the different extracts and use these estimates to COMPARE degrees of phosphorylation between wild\u2010type and <i>mbk\u20102</i> and <i>pptr\u20101</i> mutants."
