To understand the mechanism of the tri-subunit CAF-1 complex in this process, we investigated the protein-protein interactions within the CAF-1-H3/H4 architecture using biophysical and biochemical approaches. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange and chemical cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry reveal interactions that are essential for CAF-1 function in budding yeast, and importantly indicate that the Cac1 subunit functions as a scaffold within the CAF-1-H3/H4 complex. Cac1 alone not only binds H3/H4 with high affinity, but also promotes histone tetramerization independent of the other subunits. Moreover, we identify a minimal region in the C-terminus of Cac1, including the structured winged helix domain and glutamate/aspartate-rich domain, which is sufficient to induce (H3/H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramerization. These findings reveal a key role of Cac1 in histone tetramerization, providing a new model for CAF-1-H3/H4 architecture and function during eukaryotic replication."

To understand the mechanism of the tri-subunit CAF-1 complex in this process, we investigated the protein-protein interactions within the CAF-1-H3/H4 architecture using biophysical and biochemical approaches. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange and chemical cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry reveal interactions that are essential for CAF-1 function in budding yeast, and importantly indicate that the Cac1 subunit functions as a scaffold within the CAF-1-H3/H4 complex. Cac1 alone not only binds H3/H4 with high affinity, but also promotes histone tetramerization independent of the other subunits. Moreover, we identify a minimal region in the C-terminus of Cac1, including the structured winged helix domain and glutamate/aspartate-rich domain, which is sufficient to induce (H3/H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramerization. These findings reveal a key role of Cac1 in histone tetramerization, providing a new model for CAF-1-H3/H4 architecture and function during eukaryotic replication."

Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques, Liu et al. found that one of the three proteins that makes up yeast CAF-1 \u2013 called Cac1 \u2013 forms a scaffold that supports the other CAF-1 proteins and histones H3 and H4.

The assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes is critical during DNA replication, as duplication of the genome requires concerted duplication of the resident histones. To facilitate this stepwise process (<a href=\"#bib61\">Smith and Stillman, 1991</a>), eukaryotes employ histone chaperones, proteins that associate tightly with histones prior to histone deposition on DNA (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib49\">Ransom et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Das et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Burgess and Zhang, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gurard-Levin et al., 2014</a>])."

Mass spectrometric analyses using both hydrogen/deuterium exchange and chemical cross-linking reveal H3/H4-induced conformational changes, as well as extensive cross-links between the C-terminus of Cac1 with H3 and H4. Although structural and biophysical analyses reveal a homo-dimerization motif at the Cac1 C-terminus, this is not sufficient for H3/H4 tetramerization. Rather, the Cac1 glutamate/aspartate (ED) domain is also required to tetramerize H3/H4 in vitro.

Using yeast deleted for <i>CAC1,</i> we introduced either empty vector, a vector expressing wild type Cac1 or mutant Cac1 with a series of deletions and substitutions (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">3</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). CAF-1 is known to be required for resistance to DNA damaging agents that cause DNA double-strand breaks (<a href=\"#bib35\">Linger and Tyler, 2005</a>), due to its role in chromatin assembly during DNA repair. Yeast lacking Rad52 were included to provide a control showing extreme sensitivity to DNA double-strand damage. Rad52 is essential for homologous recombination, the central repair mechanism used in yeast. Whereas <i>cac1</i> yeast were sensitive to the radiomimetic zeocin, re-introduction of the vector expressing wild type <i>CAC1</i> rescued cells from DNA damage (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Of the strains that expressed Cac1 mutant proteins, the DNA damage resistance afforded by Cac1 was noticeably compromised by the 304\u2013322, 463\u2013473 and 578\u2013580 deletions in Cac1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These deletions did not significantly affect the expression levels of the Cac1 protein (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a> and data not shown). We conclude that the decreased HX in these regions upon H3/H4 binding likely reflects their importance for the physiological complex."

To determine whether these amino acids also influence the physiological response to DNA damage in yeast, we designed mutations (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">3</a>; and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>) in the loop regions, including the N-terminal loop (amino acids 7\u201317), a loop in blade 5 (amino acids 206\u2013207), two loops in blade 6 (amino acids 273/275/276/277 and 316/318), and the disordered C-terminus (amino acids 425\u2013468), in order to minimize disruption of the Cac2 structure. Vectors expressing wild type Cac2 or Cac2 bearing mutations within these regions were introduced into the <i>cac2</i> strain.

As the Cac1 C-terminus has extensive cross-links with H3/H4, we reasoned that this entire region might be responsible for H3/H4 binding and tetramerization. To test this hypothesis and identify such a minimal region, serial N-terminal deletions were designed, which included the ED domain through the C-terminus. Truncated proteins beginning at residues 386 (Cac1<sup>386</sup>), 421 (Cac1<sup>421</sup>), 454 (Cac1<sup>454</sup>), and 457 (Cac1<sup>457</sup>) were expressed and purified from <i>E. coli</i>.

Both biophysical methods reveal that amino acids 386\u2013606 within Cac1 are competent for histone tetramerization, whereas Cac1<sup>421</sup> and Cac1<sup>457</sup> are not. These results suggest that Cac1 residues 386\u2013457 \u2013 which overlap much of the ED domain \u2013 may be responsible for a significant part of the binding interactions between Cac1 and H3/H4. To test this, we used fluorescence anisotropy with pyrene-labeled Cac1<sup>386</sup> and Cac1<sup>454</sup> (Cac1<sup>386(Py)</sup> and Cac1<sup>454(Py)</sup>, respectively) to monitor pyrene anisotropy changes with H3/H4 binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In this assay, Cac1<sup>386(Py)</sup> binds H3/H4 (K<sub>Dapp</sub> = 210 nM; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) with a slightly weaker affinity than full-length Cac1 binding to H3/H4<sup>(Py)</sup> (K<sub>Dapp</sub> = 97 nM).

Likewise, unlabeled Cac1<sup>454</sup> titrated into Cac1<sup>454(Py)</sup> increased pyrene anisotropy with a similar equilibrium constant (K<sub>D</sub> = 25 nM).

However, we also found that the Cac1<sup>386(Py)</sup> - Cac1<sup>386</sup> and Cac1<sup>454(Py)</sup> - Cac1<sup>454</sup> dimers are destabilized by the histone buffer (H.B.) that is typically used in H3/H4 equilibrium binding experiments (<a href=\"#bib11\">Donham et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Scorgie et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Karantza et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Banks and Gloss, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Winkler et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Winkler et al., 2012b</a>). Importantly, our histone tetramerization assays performed in H.B.

To examine this possibility, we used pyrene as a photophysical probe for conformational changes. Cac1<sup>386(Py)</sup> harbors two pyrene-labeled cysteines (residues 440 and 454) in this region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), whereas Cac1<sup>454(Py)</sup> only has one.

To detect conformational changes in the vicinity of these cysteines, we monitored the Cac1<sup>386(Py)</sup> excimer band with a saturating concentration of either H3/H4 or Cac2. We found that binding of H3/H4 removes this excimer band, whereas Cac2 does not change the spectrum.

In contrast, we used the Batch-Tag Web function in Protein Prospector, which provides scores based on y and b ion matches for the overall cross-linked peptide complex, one cross-linked peptide only, and the other cross-linked peptide only. This analysis is useful for minimizing false positives in cross-linking experiments, as high-scoring peptides are often cross-linked to poorer-scoring peptides (<a href=\"#bib64\">Trnka et al., 2014</a>). Knowing the score of the poorer-scoring peptide, along with confirming ion matches in the spectrum, are critical determinants for a high confidence assignment.

The CAF-1 conformation may be significantly different with and without histones, as evidenced by the different inter-subunit cross-linking patterns between CAF-1 and CAF-1-H3/H4 samples (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>). In addition, extensive changes in HX occur throughout Cac1 with H3/H4 binding, even in regions not in direct contact with H3/H4 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Together, these results suggest that H3/H4 binding induces large structural changes in CAF-1."

DNA replication is coupled to histone chaperone function, as passage of the replisome stalls or slows with depletion of the histone chaperones FACT, Asf1, or CAF-1 in vivo and in vitro (<a href=\"#bib17\">Groth et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hoek and Stillman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schlesinger and Formosa, 2000</a>). The conservative model of (H3/H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer inheritance during replication (<a href=\"#bib46\">Prior et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Xu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hoek and Stillman, 2003</a>), an important mechanism for epigenetic inheritance of histone marks, is explained by the tetramer form of histones maintained by CAF-1. In contrast to other known mechanisms, monomeric CAF-1 is capable of binding (H3/H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramers through a minimal bipartite region in the monomeric Cac1 subunit. The Cac1 subunit, then, is responsible for assembling (H3/H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramers, localizing CAF-1-H3/H4 to replication forks through PCNA, and scaffolding the architecture (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shibahara and Stillman, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Krawitz et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). These biological functions likely require many protein-protein interactions through different Cac1 domains. The interactions identified by this study indeed appear to affect CAF-1-H3/H4 structure and function, as mutations designed to disrupt them impair the CAF-1-dependent DNA damage response in vivo (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3C</a>). Thus, our model presents a novel mechanism of H3/H4 binding by a histone chaperone, illuminating a unique tetramerization pathway experienced by histones during replication."

First, we made the assumption that the H3/H4 tetramerization equilibrium constant (D + D\u2019 to T) was negligible under the FA experimental conditions. This is a reasonable assumption because we have shown previously (<a href=\"#bib11\">Donham et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2012</a>) that H3/H4 exists as dimers under our experimental buffer conditions. Here, we find no anisotropy change of H3/H4<sup>(Py)</sup> with addition of unlabeled H3/H4 up to a 10 \u00b5M concentration (data not shown). Thus, the tetramerization K<sub>D</sub> is very weak relative to the CAF-1-H3/H4 K<sub>D</sub>. Second, we cannot measure K1 and K2 independently, and so report an apparent K<sub>Dapp</sub>, which is best fit with a one-site ligand depletion model."

The fitted curve is then subtracted from the dual-labeled spectrum, producing the extracted acceptor spectrum. The FRET Effect is obtained when the extracted F<sub>385</sub> spectrum is normalized by the direct excitation of acceptor (F<sub>491</sub>), which is especially valuable when an H3/H4 binding partner quenches the FM signal.

The samples were exchanged in D<sub>2</sub>O (99.9%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) at 10\u00b0C for varied lengths of time, then quenched with 100\u2009mM dibasic potassium phosphate HCl, pH 2.4 at 0\u00b0C. The samples were then immediately injected into a 0\u00b0C chamber, digested using an online immobilized pepsin column and subjected to reversed-phase UPLC (Ultra high Performance Liquid Chromatography) for high resolution separation. To determine the extent of deuteration by mass, electrospray ionization and MSe data acquisition were implemented on a Synapt G2 (Waters Corp) q-TOF (Quadrupole-Time of Flight) mass spectrometer, which enabled high resolution and accurate mass analysis of both precursor and fragment ions."

DynamX was used to assign individual isotope distributions and compute weighted average mass values for deuterated peptides. All isotope assignments by DynamX were manually validated. No back exchange correction was used, because only relative changes in deuteration were calculated, which is expected to be identical for both raw and corrected deuteration levels (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wales and Engen, 2006</a>)."

Cysteines were reduced with 1 \u00b5L of 0.5\u2009M DTT at 55\u00b0C for 20 min, then alkylated with 2.7 \u00b5L of 0.55\u2009M iodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Prior to protease treatment, 1 \u00b5L ProteaseMAX surfactant was added to ensure a denaturing environment. Trypsin (Promega #5111) or trypsin/LysC (Promega #V507A) was prepared with 50\u2009mM acetic acid to a final concentration of 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5L, while GluC (Promega #V1651) was prepared to 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5L with 50\u2009mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. Trypsin alone, trypsin/LysC, or trypsin and GluC were added to the reaction at a 1:20 protease:protein (w/w) ratio, and allowed to digest for 3\u2009hr at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was then spun down and TFA (Trifluoroacetic Acid) was added to a final volume/volume concentration of 0.5%. The sample was desalted and concentrated with a C18-embedded ZipTip (Millpore). The peptides were then vacuum-concentrated using a SpeedVac (Thermo) and resuspended in 20 \u00b5L of 0.1% FA (Formic Acid). Samples were analyzed on the LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with an Eksigent nanoLC-2D LC system. For sample injection, 8 \u00b5L of sample was loaded onto a trapping column (ZORBAX 300SB-C18, 5 \u00d7 0.3\u2009mm, 5 \u00b5m) and washed with 2% ACN (acetonitrile), 0.1% FA at a flow rate of 10 \u00b5L/min for 10 min. The trapping column was then switched online with the nano-pump at a flow rate of 600 nL/min. Peptides were separated on an in-house made 100 \u00b5m i.d. \u00d7 150\u2009mm fused silica capillary packed with Jupiter C18 Resin (Phenomex; Torrance, CA) over a 45 min gradient from 6% - 40% ACN. The flow rate was adjusted to 350 nL/min after 10 min to increase the effective separation of the peptides. Data acquisition was performed using Xcalibur (version 2.1) software. Higher energy collisional dissociation was used to produce the fragment ions in the linear ion trap from the precursor ions, which were measured in the Orbitrap mass analyzer. For every MS scan, the nineteen most intense ions were selected for fragmentation, and masses selected for fragmentation were then excluded for a duration of 120 s after a repeat count of 3. Orbitrap obtained raw files were converted to de-isotoped, centroided peak lists using an in-house script (PAVA, UCSF)."

Variable modifications included oxidized methionine, and phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine. Tryptic peptides were included, allowing for two missed cleavages. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 12 ppm (parts per million), while fragment mass tolerance was 25 ppm. The Search Compare function was used to filter spectra; cross-linked peptide spectra were confirmed with a high score value (&gt;20), low expect value (&lt;1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20135</sup>), and multiple b and y main sequence ion matches (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>)."

In addition, several binding curves fail to reach saturation (e.g., <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, as well as Cac2 and Cac3 of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

If not, what was the rationale for eliminating these critical steps? There would seem to be a problem here, because (for instance) all H3/H4 exchange should be complete by 30' based on results published by others, but the most that is seen for any histone peptide is about half exchange. And for many peptides it is much less. Please clarify."

Oddly, the HX increases here, rather than decreases (as one might predict as the simplest way to envision secondary structure stabilization upon binding). The crosslinking is compelling in suggesting that this is the interaction interface, so the surprising HX result could imply that some stabilizing Cac1 interaction in cis is broken when the protein binds to histones. Can the HXMS data help explain what is going on here? The authors may want to highlight how much exchange is going on at the two timepoints. Is HX now completely exchanged when Cac1 encounters histones, or is it completely protected without histones and is just starting to exchange when it binds to them? Even with the table in the supplement, not knowing how much of the measurement is due to back exchange versus not being exchanged in the first place (see point #3, above) makes it challenging to know what to conclude from these analyses."

Such a scheme could be helpful in rationalizing why there is no change at the H3/H3' 4-helix bundle; at first glance, one would think that this regions should gain protection going from a dimer to a tetramer (based on published HXMS results). It appears there are insufficient (any?) peptides that could be used to measure this histone interaction \u2013 can the authors comment why this might be?"

In addition, the crosslinking of not only individual residues but whole domains appears to differ in many ways between the two papers. For one example, the present work detected Cac1-histone crosslinks on the C-terminal half of Cac1, but many histone crosslinks map to the N-terminal half of Cac1 in the Kim et al. paper. Are there differences in the protocols used consistent with these observations? Does this change some of the conclusions here, and why or why not? Also, how do the EM analyses in the Kim paper comport with the model in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>?"

We stated in the manuscript that mutations, where possible, were designed in loops and not in putative structured regions, in order to retain structural integrity as much as possible.

Our equilibrium binding experiments, however, point to the idea that Cac1 residues 454-606 can bind to Cac2 and H3/H4, in addition to the DNA interactions reported previously (Zhang, et al. 2016). These interactions are generally in the low \u00b5M range or weaker, suggestive of binding and conformational plasticity in this part of the protein. The cross-links are derived from a non-equilibrium method that has little relationship to binding energy. Thus, in the context of a CAF-1 complex, Cac1 residues 454-606 may contribute weakly to the binding energy with H3/H4, whereas residues 386-453 contribute more (Cac1<sup>386</sup>-H3/H4 K<sub>Dapp</sub> = 210 nM; Cac1<sup>454</sup>-H3/H4 K<sub>D</sub> = n.c.). With this in mind, the HX changes may not be due to direct histone binding, but could also be due to allosteric conformational changes or conformational dynamics leading to transient solvent penetration. This effect can also occur if solvent-exposed hydrogen-bonded secondary structures in the WH domain encounter a binding partner that alters hydrogen bonding (reviewed in Engen, 2009)."

Rather, cross-linking is a capture method that generates information for more definitive protein-protein structural and/or biophysical experiments. This approach is extremely useful for architectural studies of complexes such as CAF-1-H3/H4, but should be complemented by extensive and careful dissection of the hypotheses generated. Thus, we employed equilibrium approaches, which validate our cross-linking findings. Specifically, we only observe cross-links between the C-terminal half of Cac1 to H3 and H4. This is consistent with our biophysical experiments, which show that full-length Cac1 binds to H3/H4 with a dissociation constant of 97 nM, while Cac1<sup>386</sup> binds to H3/H4 with a K<sub>Dapp</sub> of 210 nM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4C</a>). The bulk of the Cac1-H3/H4 interactions that contribute to lower the free energy of a CAF-1-H3/H4 complex, therefore, indeed occur at the C-terminal half of Cac1."

We are uncertain about incubation times used in the Kim, <i>et al.</i> (2016) paper."

Thus, both studies support the interpretation that the Cac1 middle domain scaffolds interactions with histones. Kim, <i>et al.</i> (2016) observe one cross-link at the C-terminus of Cac1 to histones (Cac1 K444 to H3 K64), while we report many such cross-links. The results are consistent with the C-terminus of Cac1 interacting with histones. We have now discussed these comparisons in the Discussion section:"

This FDR approach suffers when working with a small sample size, which is the case with only CAF-1 and H3/H4. Furthermore, while isotopic cross-linkers help researchers obtain extra verification of cross-linked peptides, they provide unnecessary disadvantages. The spectra from an isotopic mixture has reduced signal intensity and makes searches more difficult. This discussion is expounded in Trnka, <i>et al.</i> (2014)"

This level of analysis helps minimize false positives, as a higher percentage of mis-assignments consist of one high-scoring peptide linked to one poorer-scoring peptide, yet the overall score for the overall cross-linked pair is reported as high. Thus, knowing the score of the poorer-scoring peptide, as well as confirming the ion matches in the spectrum, are critical determinants for generating a high confidence assignment. Overall, we feel that our analytical approach is stringent. We have now discussed these comparisons in the Discussion section."
