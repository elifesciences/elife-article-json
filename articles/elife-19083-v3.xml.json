Thus, a set of enzymes and chaperones assist folding and ensure that a sufficient number of active molecules reach their final destination (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brodsky and Skach, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ellgaard et al., 2016</a>). Even with help, folding may remain inefficient and thereby sensitive to errors or mutations, leading to disease. An illustrative example of folding inefficiency, and the consequences thereof, is the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel expressed at the surface of lung epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib22\">Riordan, 2008</a>). It has been estimated that less than 25% of newly synthesized CFTR molecules actually reach the plasma membrane. When the number of functional CFTR channels is further reduced, patients suffer from Cystic Fibrosis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Riordan, 2008</a>). This is the case for mutations that affect the kinetics or thermodynamics of CFTR folding in the ER, such as the most frequent CF mutation \u0394F508, and which are recognized by ER quality control systems and targeted for degradation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Riordan, 2008</a>)."

Most transmembrane proteins, which jointly compose 30% of the human proteome, are synthesized by ER-bound ribosomes and co-translationally inserted into the ER membrane (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ellgaard et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Xu and Ng, 2015</a>). Subsequent folding must proceed in three topological environments: the ER lumen, the membrane and the cytosol. In each of these environments, the protein may benefit from the help of chaperones and folding enzymes. On the luminal side, these are fairly well characterized and include HSP40, HSP70 and HSP90 family members (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brodsky and Skach, 2011</a>), the lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lamriben et al., 2016</a>) and protein disulfide isomerases (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brodsky and Skach, 2011</a>). Less is known about the assisted folding in the ER membrane and on the cytosolic side. If folding or assembly in any of these environments fails, the protein is recognized by quality control machineries and targeted to the ER associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lemus and Goder, 2014</a>). ERAD involves polyubiquitination of the cytosolic domains of transmembrane protein, extraction from the ER membrane and degradation by the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lemus and Goder, 2014</a>)."

LRP6 is a type I membrane protein composed of a large extracellular domain containing multiple \u00df-propeller and EGF-like domains (<a href=\"#bib20\">MacDonald et al., 2009</a>). Proper folding of the \u00df-propeller domains depends of the dedicated LRP6 chaperone Mesd (mesoderm development) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hsieh et al., 2003</a>) and possibly other chaperones such as calnexin. We have previously shown that exit of LRP6 from the ER also requires a cytoplasmic post-translational modification, namely S-palmitoylation, on two cysteine residues in close proximity to the transmembrane domain (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abrami et al., 2008b</a>). LRP6 acylation influences the conformation of this domain, possibly by alleviating the hydrophobic mismatch between the thickness of the membrane and the length of the hydrophobic stretch composing the transmembrane domain. Mutation of the palmitoylation sites leads to retention of LRP6 in the ER and ubiquitination on Lys-1403 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abrami et al., 2008b</a>) indicative of its recognition by a quality control mechanism (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feldman and van der Goot, 2009</a>). Once properly folded, LRP6 exits the ER, it transits through the Golgi, as indicated by the acquisition of Endoglycosidase H insensitive complex sugars (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abrami et al., 2008b</a>), before reaching the plasma membrane where its signal role takes place."

We show that newly synthesized wild type LRP6 also undergoes ubiquitination, on the same site (Lys-1403), and that this post-translational modification promotes its folding. For ER exit to occur, ubiquitination must however be subsequently removed. This is mediated by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP19, one of the isoforms of which is tail-anchored to the ER (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hassink et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Wing, 2016</a>). It is thought to play an essential role in skeletal muscle atrophy through unclear mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib23\">Wing, 2016</a>). At the more mechanistic level, USP19 has been shown to control the stability of several cytoplasmic proteins such as the inhibitors of apoptosis c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mei et al., 2011</a>), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Altun et al., 2012</a>) and the initiator of autophagy Beclin1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jin et al., 2016</a>). Interestingly, USP19 is a target gene of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and was found to rescue CFTR \u0394F508 from ERAD (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hassink et al., 2009</a>). More recently it was found that USP19 is a key player in a novel misfolded-protein associated secretion MAPS pathway (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lee et al., 2016</a>). We show that USP19 controls the cellular levels of LRP6. In the absence of USP19, LRP6 is efficiently targeted to ERAD. Upon USP19 overexpression, ER exit of LRP6 is greatly enhanced."

Upon ubiquitination on Lys-1403, LRP6 presumably interacts with an ubiquitin-binding protein that acts as a chaperone and provides the protein with time to fold. If folding is successful, LRP6 is transported out of the ER, a step that is favored by palmitoylation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abrami et al., 2008b</a>). If folding is impaired or delayed, polyubiquitination of other cytosolic lysine residues takes over and targets LRP6 to ERAD. The here identified ubiquitination-deubiquitination assisted-folding cycle also appears to operate on other membrane proteins such as CFTR or the anthrax toxin receptor 2 (also know as Capillary Morphogenesis gene 2, CMG2), loss of function of which leads to Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome (<a href=\"#bib8\">Deuquet et al., 2012</a>)."

To determine the relative contribution of these pathways to the degradation of LRP6, we repeated the 20 min metabolic pulse-chase experiments while either inhibiting the proteasome with MG132 or preventing lysosomal degradation by inhibiting the vacuolar ATPase with Bafilomycin A. MG132 protected LRP6 from degradation early after synthesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>), consistent with degradation of a subpopulation of LRP6 molecules by ERAD during biogenesis.

That LRP6 undergoes degradation by two distinct pathways is further support by the observation that palmitoylation deficient LRP6, in which the two cysteines are mutated to serines (LRP6<sup>CC\u2013SS</sup>), and which does not exit the ER (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abrami et al., 2008b</a>), is partially rescued by MG132 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>) but is insensitive to inhibitors of lysosomal enzymes such as Bafilomycin A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>) or leupeptin (supplementary information in [<a href=\"#bib2\">Abrami et al., 2008b</a>]).

Pulse-chase experiments with long <sup>35</sup>S pulses indeed reveal biphasic decay curves for all mutants studied, and show the existence, irrespective of the mutations, of a minor population of extremely long-lived molecules, which presumably reside at the plasma membrane. Importantly these constitute the steady state population that is revealed by western blotting. Western blot analysis of LRP6 mutants may therefore be misleading as to the importance of specific residues for biogenesis and membrane targeting (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abrami et al., 2008b</a>)."

This interaction provides LRP6 with time to fold \u2013and as such this ubiquitin-binding protein would act as a chaperone\u2013 protecting it from ERAD targeting. Lys-1403 is then deubiquitinated. At this stage, LRP6 can either (1) undergo palmitoylation of its two juxtamembranous cysteine residues, followed by ER exit, (2) be re-ubiquitinated on Lys-1403, or (3) be polyubiquitinated on one of the other 16 cytoplasmic lysine residues and sent to ERAD. Option 1, re-ubiquitination on Lys-1403, allows LRP6 to undergo a second cycle of interaction with its ubiquitin-binding chaperone, further promoting folding. Palmitoylation, which favors ER exit (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abrami et al., 2008b</a>), could prevent LRP6 from Lys-1403 ubiquitination, possibly through a conformational change of steric hindrance given the juxtamembrane localization of both modifications."

Of these, the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) represent the largest family with 56 members (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ye, 2006</a>). Because LRP6 folding takes place in the ER, we searched for ER-associated DUBs and to the best of our knowledge, only USP19 has an ER localized isoform (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clague et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hassink et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Wing, 2016</a>). Endogenous LRP6 and USP19 could be co-immunoprecipitated from RPE1 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). While ubiquitination of LRP6 is undetectable under control condition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; see also <a href=\"#bib2\">Abrami et al., 2008b</a>), silencing of <i>usp19</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) revealed a clear LRP6 ubiquitination signal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), often, but not always, appearing as a well identifiable band and a smear. Strikingly, LRP6 levels dropped drastically upon <i>usp19</i> silencing whether in HeLa (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), RPE1 cells or primary human fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Silencing of <i>usp19</i> also led to an increase in ubiquitination of palmitoylation-deficient LRP6<sup>CC\u2013SS</sup>\u00a0and a decrease of its expression (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). In reverse, over expression of wild type USP19, but not of its catalytically inactive mutant (USP19<sup>C506S</sup> [<a href=\"#bib12\">Hassink et al., 2009</a>]) reduced ubiquitination of LRP6<sup>CC\u2013SS</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), indicating that USP19 influences LRP6 ubiquitination in a manner that depends on its DUB activity.

Finally, these observations demonstrate that USP19 promotes the biogenesis of LRP6, with only 18% of newly synthesized LRP6 molecules surviving beyond 6 hr in the absence of USP19 and 60% surviving upon USP19 overexpression."

More specifically we show that following synthesis, LRP6 undergoes ubiquitination on Lys-1403, most likely of a specific form. In conceptual analogy to the binding of newly synthesized mono-glucosylated proteins to calnexin in the ER lumen (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lamriben et al., 2016</a>), we hypothesize that Lys-1403-ubiquitin can interact with a putative ER-ubiquitin binding protein that would also act as a chaperone. Upon release from this putative ubiquitin-binding chaperone, LRP6 is deubiquitinated by USP19. Following USP19 deubiquitination, LRP6 can, if properly folded, exit the ER, an events possibly promoted by palmitoylation of cysteines in the vicinity of Lys-1403 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abrami et al., 2008b</a>). Or, LRP6 can undergo a new cycle of Lys-1403-specific ubiquitination and chaperone binding. Upon prolonged presence in the ER, LRP6 undergoes polyubiquitination on other cytosolic lysines, leading to ERAD targeting. In the ER, LRP6 can thus undergo two types of ubiquitination events, which operate with different kinetics: (1) specific ubiquitination on Lys-1403 which promotes folding, (2) the slower polyubiquitination on other lysines which promotes ERAD. These two types of ubiquitination events are reminiscent of de-glucosidation and de-mannosidation of glycoproteins in the ER lumen, which also occur with different kinetics. De-glucosidation promotes folding of glycosylated protein, but if folding is too lengthy or fails, de-mannosidation takes place and targets the protein to ERAD."

We indeed found that <i>usp19</i> silencing also led to a pronounced decrease in the levels of CMG2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), defective folding of which lead to Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome (OMIM #228600) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Deuquet et al., 2009</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib7\">2011</a>). Silencing of <i>usp19</i> however did not affect the levels of the CMG2-related protein TEM8 (Tumor endothelial marker 8), nor those of the Transferrin and the EGF receptors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). USP19 was reported to rescue the CFTR \u0394508 mutant, which is an ERAD substrate (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hassink et al., 2009</a>). USP19 however also controls proteostasis of wild type CFTR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Future studies are required to establish the generality of this ubiquitin-dependent folding system, determine whether it has a built-in quality control, and identify the missing components such as the folding-promoting ubiquitin ligase, the putative ubiquitin-binding chaperone and the degradation-targeting ligase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

Consistently surface LRP6, monitored by surface biotinylation, decreases upon USP19 silencing. We show gradual decrease of LRP6 at the cells surface after 1, 2 and 3 days of siRNA. At day 3 of siRNA, LRP6 levels are undetectable at the surface but also very low in the total cell extract. Therefore, quantification of surface LRP6 was performed at day 2 of siRNA, when total LRP6 levels are still detectable (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."
