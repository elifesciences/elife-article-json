Functions hinge upon allosteric differences coupled to the ZTL photocycle; however, structural and kinetic information was unavailable. Herein, we tune the ZTL photocycle over two orders of magnitude. These variants reveal that ZTL complexes with targets independent of light, but dictates enhanced protein degradation in the dark. In vivo experiments definitively show photocycle kinetics dictate the rate of clock component degradation, thereby impacting circadian period. Structural studies demonstrate that photocycle dependent activation of ZTL depends on an unusual dark-state conformation of ZTL. Crystal structures of ZTL LOV domain confirm delineation of structural and kinetic mechanisms and identify an evolutionarily selected allosteric hinge differentiating modes of PAS/LOV signal transduction. The combined biochemical, genetic and structural studies provide new mechanisms indicating how PAS/LOV proteins integrate environmental variables in complex networks."

Functions hinge upon allosteric differences coupled to the ZTL photocycle; however, structural and kinetic information was unavailable. Herein, we tune the ZTL photocycle over two orders of magnitude. These variants reveal that ZTL complexes with targets independent of light, but dictates enhanced protein degradation in the dark. In vivo experiments definitively show photocycle kinetics dictate the rate of clock component degradation, thereby impacting circadian period. Structural studies demonstrate that photocycle dependent activation of ZTL depends on an unusual dark-state conformation of ZTL. Crystal structures of ZTL LOV domain confirm delineation of structural and kinetic mechanisms and identify an evolutionarily selected allosteric hinge differentiating modes of PAS/LOV signal transduction. The combined biochemical, genetic and structural studies provide new mechanisms indicating how PAS/LOV proteins integrate environmental variables in complex networks."

A plant called <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> has a light-sensitive protein called ZEITLUPE (or ZTL for short) that helps it keep its circadian clock in sync with the cycle of night and day. Previous studies have shown that light activates this protein causing part of it to change shape and then revert back after a period of about an hour and a half. However, it was unclear if this timing was important for ZEITLUPE to allow plants to keep track of time."

A chemical bond forms when light activates ZEITLUPE, and it turns out that how long this bond lasts before it breaks plays an important role in allowing plants to maintain a 24-hour circadian clock. This chemical bond controls the shape changes that guide the protein\u2019s activities and, when Pudasaini et al. modified ZEITLUPE so that it took much longer for this bond to break, they could tune how fast the plant\u2019s internal clocks run. In essence, the time between the bond forming and breaking breaks acts like a countdown on a stopwatch, and it must be precisely timed to keep the clock in pace with the environment."

Key to these circadian and photoperiodic responses is measurement of day length through complicated feedback loops involving sensory proteins. These sensory proteins involve members of the Period-ARNT-Singleminded and its Light, Oxygen, or Voltage (PAS/LOV respectively) subclass that couple photic-input to metabolic and stress pathways (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lokhandwala et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sahar and Sassone-Corsi, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Taylor and Zhulin, 1999</a>). Currently, how these signaling components are integrated is poorly understood due to a difficulty in decoupling photochemistry from allosteric protein changes and signal transduction. In plants and fungal species, LOV domain containing proteins act at signaling nodes to integrate sensory responses into circadian, reproductive and stress pathways (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lokhandwala et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Imaizumi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Somers et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zoltowski et al., 2007</a>). Central to their function are two key elements of the PAS family: (1) The ability to sense and respond to diverse environmental stimuli, and (2) The presence of multiple interaction surfaces that engage targets in a selective manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The ability to trigger these elements with light has positioned LOV proteins as an allosteric model and enabled the development of LOV optogenetic tools (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pudasaini et al., 2015</a>). However, limited understanding of how chemistry is linked to allostery and downstream signaling hampers our understanding of these systems."

The circadian clock regulates the expression profile of GI protein with its peak near the end of the light period. The ZTL-GI interaction is enhanced when the ZTL LOV domain absorbs blue light. This interaction stabilizes both ZTL and GI proteins toward the end of the day, thus ZTL protein level also peaks at that time, although <i>ZTL</i> transcript levels are constitutive. TOC1 expression is also clock regulated with expression mainly during the nighttime. ZTL interacts with TOC1 in a light-independent manner, however ZTL mediated TOC1 degradation is enhanced at night.

A consensus mechanism is summarized. LOV domains are typified by blue-light induced formation of a C4a adduct between a conserved Cys residue and a bound flavin (FAD, FMN or riboflavin) cofactor (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zoltowski and Gardner, 2011</a>). C4a adduct formation then drives rotation of a conserved Gln residue to initiate conformational changes within N- or C-terminal extensions (Ncap/Ccap) to the LOV core (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zoltowski and Gardner, 2011</a>). These N/Ccap elements in turn regulate activity of effector domains or recruit proteins to Ncap, Ccap or \u03b2-sheet surfaces (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,C,E</a>). Upon incubation in the dark, or in the presence of UV-A light, the signaling adduct state spontaneously decays on a timescale of seconds to days (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zoltowski and Gardner, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kennis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pudasaini and Zoltowski, 2013</a>). In this manner, LOV proteins dictate transiently stable signaling states capable of switching between a distinct on and off state depending on lighting conditions (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zoltowski et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Halavaty and Moffat, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Harper et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zoltowski et al., 2013</a>). These photoswitchable functions have made LOV proteins targets for optogenetic devices; however, currently we have limited understanding of the role of LOV photocycle kinetics for in vivo function. Genetic and photochemical studies of plant circadian and photoperiodic timing indicate <i>Arabidopsis</i> may function as a model organism for delineating the roles of photochemistry and allostery in LOV function."

Recent research indicates that their divergent roles in the circadian clock and photoperiodic flowering may enable interrogation of how chemistry regulates PAS/LOV protein function to select for signaling pathways (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zoltowski and Imaizumi, 2014</a>).

Light-state ZTL has two primary functions, formation of a LOV-GI complex to allow protein accumulation during the day via enhanced ZTL/GI stability (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2007</a>), and ZTL/GI-dependent destabilization of CO in the morning (<a href=\"#bib56\">Song et al., 2014</a>). The latter results in antagonistic roles of ZTL and FKF1 in the photoperiodic response, and may contribute to a late-flowering phenotype in some ztl mutants (<a href=\"#bib54\">Somers et al., 2004</a>). Throughout the night, ZTL mediates rapid degradation of the clock components, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) and PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 5 (PRR5) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kiba et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fujiwara et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">M\u00e1s et al., 2003b</a>). TOC1 protein levels contribute to the control of period length of the circadian clock (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zoltowski and Imaizumi, 2014</a>). Impaired degradation of TOC1 by ZTL mutants lead to accumulation of TOC1 and PRR5 protein and a long-period phenotype consistent with strains harboring additional copies of TOC1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">De Caluw\u00e9 et al., 2016</a>). Interestingly, TOC1 degradation appears to be in competition with GI, occurs with an approximately 2 hr delay following dusk, and is enhanced in the dark (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zoltowski and Imaizumi, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">M\u00e1s et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Song et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2007</a>). Current models explain such behavior in TOC1/PRR5 turnover by imparting a differential function between day and night conditions (<a href=\"#bib7\">De Caluw\u00e9 et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pokhilko et al., 2013</a>), where TOC1/PRR5 are targeted for degradation by ZTL regardless of lighting conditions, but degradation activity is enhanced in the dark. How this is achieved at the molecular and chemical level is not well understood."

Therein, we tackle two outstanding questions in the PAS/LOV field; (1) What purpose, if any, does the LOV photocycle lifetime play in biological function? Previous research proposed divergent roles for ZTL and FKF1 in the measurement of light intensity and day length (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pudasaini and Zoltowski, 2013</a>), however no experimental validation of such a model has been available. Further, with the exception of a fungal system (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dasgupta et al., 2015</a>), the role of LOV lifetimes in biology remains elusive. (2) How do PAS/LOV proteins signal to multiple interaction surfaces to allow signal integration? Based on structural studies of ZTL we have developed protein variants that decouple photocycle lifetimes from signal transduction. In this manner, we show a definitive role of LOV lifetime in circadian timing. Further, we provide an allosteric model of LOV signal transduction enabling selection of diverse protein:protein interactions."

Namely by replacing indistinct day and night conditions by a difference in activity between light and dark-state ZTL, where the light-state inhibits ZTL activity in regards to degradation. In this manner, dark-state reversion activates ZTL during evening. Incorporating ZTL photochemistry into existing models of PRR5 results in <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a> (see Mathematical model generation in methods), where c<sub>PRR5</sub> is the concentration of PRR5 protein, k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub> the light and dark-state degradation constants and k<sub>3</sub> the rate of adduct decay for ZTL. An analogous equation, with equivalent k<sub>3</sub> dependence, can be derived for TOC1 (<a href=\"#equ13\">Equation S12</a>), however, the expression pattern of TOC1 and complex regulation of TOC1 mRNA complicates analysis of TOC1 levels during the circadian cycle.

These are G46 (Ser in FKF1) that lies adjacent to the active site Q154 implicated in Gln-flip signal transduction mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zoltowski and Gardner, 2011</a>), V48 (Ile in FKF1) that sterically interacts with C82 (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zoltowski et al., 2009</a>), and G80 that lies in a GXNCRFLQ motif (X80=G for ZTL, X=R for FKF1) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). The V48 position is known to alter LOV photocycle kinetics by V/I/T substitutions (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zoltowski et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">El-Arab et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Christie et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lokhandwala et al., 2016</a>). This site has been exploited in optogenetic tools to tune signal duration under the presumption that it does not affect allosteric regulation of protein function (<a href=\"#bib57\">Strickland et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, to the best of our knowledge, the G80 position has not been exploited for tuning LOV kinetics. This likely is due to <i>Arabidopsis</i> ZTL being unusual amongst LOV proteins in containing a Gly residue at this position. As a consequence of G80, ZTL expresses poorly in <i>E. coli</i> and is largely confined to inclusion bodies (see Materials and methods). Since, G80 is unique to <i>Arabidopsis</i> ZTL, and R/Q/K substitutions are permitted in other ZEITLUPE and LOV proteins (see Discussion), it is unlikely to affect allostery and may function as a site to uniquely affect photocycle kinetics."

Double variants G46S:G80R and V48I:G80R function cooperatively to extend the ZTL photocycle to 21 hr or\u00a0&gt;65 hr respectively, very similar to WT FKF1 (62.5 hr) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pudasaini and Zoltowski, 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In addition, the difference in values for k<sub>3</sub> in these variants are sufficient to elicit theoretical differences in PRR5/TOC1 degradation rates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To verify that rate-altering variants do not also perturb allosteric regulation of ZTL function it is essential to obtain crystal structures of ZTL variants and to map an allosteric trajectory that couples C4a adduct formation to regulation of ZTL function. Towards these aims we solved 2.5 \u00c5, 2.6 \u00c5, and 2.1 \u00c5 crystal structures of dark-state WT ZTL, G80R and V48I:G80R (residues 29\u2013165) respectively (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

These structures reveal functional differences from all known LOV structures that differentiate the effects of V48I and G80R on ZTL signaling mechanisms. Namely, G80R structures are analogous to WT in all manners. The primary difference is the formation of a \u03c0-cation interaction that stabilizes the D\u03b1/E\u03b1 linkage and C82 that is necessary for C4a adduct formation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Increased rigidity of C82 imposed by the \u03c0-cation interaction is consistent with having an effect only on photocycle kinetics. In contrast, examination of V48I containing structures reveals distinct differences that identify allosteric signal transduction mechanisms to the N/Ccap. These mechanisms identify V48I as a residue that disrupts allosteric regulation of ZTL function. Below, we provide detailed analysis of ZTL in dark and light states to highlight these functional differences. We focus on two reported aspects of ZTL group function, LOV:LOV mediated homodimerization and allosteric regulation of Ncap and Ccap elements."

The observed steric stabilization through the \u03c0-cation interaction is consistent with the longer photocycle in G80R. V48I positions the additional methyl group into a pocket adjacent to N5, C82 and Q154. Comparisons of AsLOV2 structures (white; buried conformation), dark-state ZTL (yellow; exposed conformation) demonstrates that V48I can impact the position of Q154 between buried and exposed conformations. Movement of Q154 correlates with movement of F156 in I\u03b2. (<b>C\u2013F</b>) ZTL monomers are defined by an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet flanked by a series of \u03b1-helices (C\u03b1, D\u03b1, E\u03b1, F\u03b1). The helices cradle the photoreactive FMN adjacent to C82 (E\u03b1 helix). ZTL contains a 9-residue insert linking the E-F helices that accommodates the adenine ring of FAD in some LOV proteins (black) (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zoltowski et al., 2007</a>). N- and C-terminal extensions (Ncap/Ccap; yellow) are largely disordered; however, a short helix within the Ncap reaches across a dimer interface in some molecules to form contacts between the C\u03b1 and D\u03b1 helices. Two dimer interfaces are formed through the \u03b2-scaffold in ZTL. The compact dimer (<b>C,D</b>) differs from the elongated dimer (<b>E,F</b>) by a 2.0 \u00c5 translation along the \u03b2-sheet. Key residues in the dimer interface are shown in yellow. The translation disrupts a network of sulfur-\u03c0 and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions involving C45 and F47, centered around I151.

Consistent with solution studies, the crystallographic lattice is defined by two sets of anti-parallel dimers formed by extensive contacts along the \u03b2-scaffold.

However, based on two lines of evidence, we conclude that the \u03b2-scaffold interface represents the solution ZTL and FKF1 homodimers. First, FKF1 lacking the entire E-F loop and ZTL variants that disrupt R95 contacts remain dimeric (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nakasako et al., 2005</a>).

Close examination of residues linking the Ncap and Ccap to the active site FMN identifies distinguishing interactions that may be involved in signal transduction. The loss of Ncap density in the elongated dimer directly follows a CGF motif (C45-G46-F47-(V48)) that links the Ncap, FMN binding pocket and the V48 position (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

Lack of density for an adduct is consistent with minimal population of the light-state species. Density shows clear selection of the I48 methyl group towards Q154. Some residual density is present in the buried conformation of Q154 that indicates either partial occupancy of the site in the dark, or residual light-state conformations. The buried conformation correlates with the orientation of Q154 in all other LOV structures as depicted by AsLOV2. Electron density for FMN is excluded to allow clear observation of electron density for active site side-chains.

Orientations of WT/G80R Q154 are derived from the dark-state G80R ZTL structure with buried and exposed conformations shown for reference from V48I:G80R. WT/G80R and V48I:G80R deviate from typical LOV models (derived from VVD: light PDBID 3RH8, dark PDBID 2PD7) on the position of Q154. WT/G80R ZTL retains a heterogeneous orientation of Q154. We propose that Q154 is heterogeneous regardless of lighting conditions, but biased towards the buried conformation in the light. At dusk adduct decay, with rate constant k<sub>3</sub>, causes the Q154 conformation to be biased towards an exposed conformation, accelerating ubquitination of protein targets. For V48I, I48 selects the exposed conformation in the dark and leads to only partial burying of Q154 (shown in C, (<b>D</b>), leading to constitutively high ubquitination activity that mimics the dark-state of WT-ZTL.

The altered conformations contact the A\u03b2-Ncap hinge through G46 in the CGF motif (Ncap; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Here, Q154 abuts (3.4 \u00c5) the C\u03b1 carbon of G46 (Ser in FKF1). The lack of a side chain at G46 permits favorable interactions for Q154 at the flavin O4 position and allows insertion of F156 into the flavin active site. In this manner an unusual orientation of Q154 links the I\u03b2-Ccap hinge and helical interface through a QFF motif (Q154-F155-F156). In most LOV proteins, the equivalent residue to F156 is hydrophilic and adopts a solvent exposed position (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The resulting cavity occupied by F156 is filled by a Met or Leu residue (V69 in ZTL) from C\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D</a>). In ZTL, the altered orientation of Q154 clashes with typical orientations of C\u03b1. Steric clashes lead to movement of conserved F66 and rotation of V69 away from Q154 and the FMN binding pocket."

Thus, it is likely that ZTL does not involve an H-bonding switch in signal transduction and that canonical mechanisms of LOV signaling may not be universally conserved. Rather, we propose that steric interactions involving the flavin O4 position and G46 shift a dynamic equilibrium in the Q154 position to stabilize the ZTL protein in a light-state configuration. We posit that the heterogeneous orientation of Q154 destabilizes ZTL in the absence of covalently attached FMN, consistent with in vitro studies demonstrating a tendency to lose flavin rapidly. Upon light activation, ZTL is stabilized by covalent attachment of FMN (through C82) and results in movement of Q154 that necessitates rearrangement of the CGF, QFF and C\u03b1 sites to elicit signal transduction."

The Q154 conformation is not heterogeneous in V48I:G80R, rather, the Ile side chain sterically directs Q154 to an exposed conformation near O4 that has not been observed in other LOV proteins. Comparing the dark-state to V48I:G80R grown in the light, confirms density for the C4A adduct and confirms direct crystallization of the light-state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Difference density maps of the light-state molecule indicate that adduct formation is coupled to rotation of Q154 to a buried position (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Unexpectedly, rotation of Q154 requires concerted movement of I48 that reorients the Ncap. Thus, the presence of G46 selects for a heterogeneous conformation of Q154 and V48I biases the heterogeneous Q154 towards the exposed conformation in the dark. In the light, V48I disrupts rotation of Q154 to the buried conformation, thereby leading to a predominantly exposed conformation regardless of lighting conditions. Thus, unexpectedly, V48I is both an allosteric variant and alters photocycle kinetics. In particular, V48I retains an ability to form the covalent C4a adduct, which is more stable than WT (V48I k<sub>3</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.094 hr<sup>\u22121</sup>; WT k<sub>3</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.71 hr<sup>\u22121</sup>).

In this manner, G80R acts as a photocycle variant only and allows direct testing of LOV photocycle kinetics on targeted degradation of PRR5 and TOC1 (see <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>). In contrast, despite being photochemically active and stabilizing the C4a adduct, V48I blocks allosteric regulation of the Ncap through incomplete rotation of Q154 and selection of a distinct exposed conformation of Q154. Thus, we propose that V48I is an allosteric variant that mimics the degradation-active dark state. Combining our proposed mechanism with <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a> above and existing literature on light-dark formation of ZTL:GI complexes we make the following testable hypotheses: (1) V48I should demonstrate weaker interactions with GI.

CoIP results confirm that G80R retains light regulated complex formation with GI comparable to WT. In contrast, Ncap variants G46S and V48I both alter light driven complex formation with GI (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Whereas, V48I leads to dampened light-driven formation of the ZTL:GI complex, G46S enhances GI complex formation in both the dark- and light-states (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These results support our allosteric model of ZTL regulation and demonstrate that Ncap variants decouple allosteric regulation of signal transduction from photochemical formation of the C4a adduct. Further, the data implicates light-driven conformational changes near the Ncap in dictating GI interactions. Specifically, where V48I mimics the weak GI interacting dark-state and G46S mimics the strong GI interacting light state. We note that the G46S results reported here diverge from the effects of the G46E mutation reported by <a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al. (2007)</a>, where G46E abolishes GI interactions due to apparent misfolding of the LOV domain. These results are informative on the nature of mutations at the G46 site, namely the long side chain present in a G46E variant leads to steric clashes and likely would force E46 into a hydrophobic pocket (see <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We contend such clashes leads to the destabilization of the LOV domain and abolition of GI interactions as reported previously for G46E (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, the shorter sidechain in G46S, can be easily accommodated by a subtle rotation of the active site Q154 towards the proposed light-state buried conformation (modeled in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Such results are consistent with enhanced GI interactions in G46S. Combined, the results implicate the G46/V48 locus in ZTL allostery and regulation."

Literature indicates ZTL stability is dictated by GI interactions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2007</a>). Thus, we could expect low ZTL levels in V48I variants. These low ZTL levels would act in opposition to any increased targeted degradation of PRR5/TOC1 and could mask allosteric phenotypes. Based on our experimental conditions, we do not expect any complications to result. Prior studies indicate that ZTL and GI reciprocally stabilize each other (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2007</a>), but increased ZTL stability occurs in a circadian phase dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kim et al., 2003</a>). Light does enhance ZTL:GI affinity and reciprocal stability by three fold, but ZTL retains some stabilization during the subjective circadian day regardless of lighting conditions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2003</a>). These previous findings suggest that in consideration of the ZTL:GI equilibrium, GI is limiting except during the subjective circadian day. During the day, GI levels rise sufficiently to shift the equilibrium to saturate the ZTL:GI complex regardless of lighting conditions. Given that our V48I variant retains light-state affinity comparable to WT dark-state protein, GI expression during the subjective day under LL conditions should rescue the decrease in affinity. Concomitant with ZTL-ox, reciprocal stabilization of ZTL/GI should lead to high ZTL levels and ZTL should no longer oscillate. Indeed, under our experimental conditions cycling of ZTL protein is lost and V48I variants show enhanced stability in vivo (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), thereby the role of GI in ZTL stability is masked under our conditions and our results likely reflect the effect of ZTL photochemistry (G80R) and allosteric activation of PRR5/TOC1 degradation (V48I) independent of the effects on GI binding."

As a result, we should observe an enhanced delay in PRR5/TOC1 degradation in G80R variants as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. For V48I and V48I:G80R, the allosteric effects should enhance degradation of PRR5 and TOC1 leading to constitutively low PRR5/TOC1 levels."

Further, comparison of apparent rate constants for PRR5 degradation confirms a direct effect of ZTL photocycle kinetics on PRR5 degradation, where G80R #22 (0.34 hr<sup>\u22121</sup> LD, 0.14 hr<sup>\u22121</sup> LL) exhibits smaller rate constants compared to WT-ox (0.5 hr<sup>\u22121</sup> LD, 0.13 hr<sup>\u22121</sup> LL) under LD conditions where k<sub>3</sub> is most relevant (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>).

Previous studies of ZTL-ox variants demonstrate a dose dependent effect of ZTL on circadian period, where high protein levels lead to short-period phenotypes progressing to arrhythmicity and ZTL-nulls having a long-period phenotype (<a href=\"#bib54\">Somers et al., 2004</a>). Similarly, TOC1 overexpression strains have a long-period phenotype and TOC1-null strains have short periods (<a href=\"#bib35\">M\u00e1s et al., 2003b</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gendron et al., 2012</a>). Thus, we predict that despite overexpression the defect in degradation of TOC1 by G80R-ox should lead to WT periods. In contrast, low TOC1 levels in V48I and V48I:G80R should lead to arrhythmic phenotypes under expression levels comparable to WT-ox strains demonstrating normal periods."

Whereas, FKF1 function and transcription is specific to the day, ZTL demonstrates constitutive transcription and distinct functions during the day and night (<a href=\"#bib56\">Song et al., 2014</a>). These distinct functions allow ZTL to impact photoperiodic flowering through morning specific and GI-dependent destabilization of CO, and circadian function through night specific degradation of TOC1 and PRR5 (<a href=\"#bib34\">M\u00e1s et al., 2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Song et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kiba et al., 2007</a>). These results suggest that both light (CO destabilization/GI interaction) and dark (TOC1/PRR5 degradation) activate ZTL for function.

In all dark and light-state LOV structures currently in the protein data bank, the active site Gln (Q154 in ZTL) adopts a distinct buried conformation in the dark, with the NH moiety of the Gln side chain near flavin-N5 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Halavaty and Moffat, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zoltowski et al., 2007</a>). Existing light-state structures indicate that C4a adduct formation and N5 protonation induces rotation of the Gln side chain to favor an H-bond between flavin-HN5 and the O moiety of the Gln side chain (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vaidya et al., 2011</a>). In those structures, the Gln residue maintains the buried conformation and is only distinguished by the nature of H-bonds. In our ZTL structures this is not the case, rather dark-state structures have a heterogeneous orientation of Q154 that samples orientation near both the buried conformation and an exposed conformation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A heterogeneous conformation of the key signaling switch would suggest poor regulation of function under dark-state conditions. This is exactly what is observed in ZTL. ZTL retains fairly robust activity for GI interactions and TOC1/PRR5 degradation in both the light and dark, with light enhancing GI interactions and repressing TOC1/PRR5 degradation by 3\u20135 fold (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2007</a>) and (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). As such, GI-dependent function in CO destabilization is likely not a light-regulated event, but rather is a combined result of constitutive transcription of ZTL, day-specific expression of GI and poor signal amplification following light-dark interconversion due to the heterogeneous orientation of Q154. Thus, the unusual Gln orientations appear to be evolutionarily selected to permit light- and dark-state functions of ZTL and to differentiate ZTL and FKF1."

Examination of the ZTL structures identifies two key residues involved in regulating ZTL allostery. The heterogeneous conformation of Q154 is permitted by the lack of a sidechain in G46 (model in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Introduction of V48I, directs Q154 to a single exposed conformation in the dark. Biasing the Q154 to the exposed conformation results in disrupted interactions with GI and high TOC1/PRR5 degradation, in vivo, consistent with selecting for a distinct dark-state conformation. Further, the light-state V48I:G80R molecule indicates partial Q154 rotation to a buried conformation that is impeded by V48I. This impediment does not allow robust sampling of the buried conformation under any lighting conditions and coincides with constitutively high TOC1/PRR5 degradation in V48I containing variants. Combined we propose a putative model of ZTL signaling (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). ZTL retains functionality in the light and dark due to a heterogeneous orientation of Q154 permitted by G46 and V48. Differences in functionality between dark/light result from subtle biases in the orientation of Q154 between buried and exposed conformations. Based on V48I:G80R structures and activity, we propose that biasing towards the exposed conformation as the dark-state configuration (enhanced PRR5/TOC1 degradation) and biasing towards the buried conformation as the light-state configuration (enhanced GI binding)."

The altered signaling mechanism in ZTL is supported by examination of LOV proteins in <i>Brassica rapa</i>. ZTL-like proteins in <i>Brassica</i> and <i>At</i>LKP2 contain a Q154L substitution, resulting in an LXF consensus sequence at that locus. The presence of a Q154L substitution is unexpected, since these substitutions abrogate blue light signaling in other LOV proteins due to an inability to undergo the Gln-flip mechanism (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zoltowski et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nash et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nozaki et al., 2004</a>). In the proposed ZTL mechanism a Gln-flip is not necessitated and Q\u2192L substitutions are permitted. In this manner, our understanding of a canonical model of LOV signal transduction is incomplete. We propose that evolutionary selections at G46 and V48 tune allostery to the Ncap through the Q154 orientation to differentiate modes of LOV signal transduction. Given the evolutionary selection of A/S residues and permission of V48 substitutions in FKF1, we propose that FKF1 functions in a manner analogous to other LOV proteins, where light activates the biological function (CO stabilization/CDF degradation) of the primarily nuclear FKF1 protein. In this manner, evolutionary selection at position 46 may dictate day functional (FKF1) and day/night functional (ZTL) differentiation, thereby implicating LOV photocycle kinetics as being imperative for proper signal transduction."

In these models, GI expression during the day both stabilizes and sequesters ZTL. In the evening, GI pools decline leading to active free ZTL. In light of our data, the competition model must be incomplete. In the competition model there should be no differences in the LL/LD characteristics in WT and G80R strains. In the competition model GI expression profiles should dictate delays and these would be unaffected by rate-altering ZTL variants. WT and G80R interact with GI to comparable levels, yet G80R demonstrates enhanced delays in PRR5 and TOC1 degradation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

In contrast, modeling PRR5 degradation using the time dependent conversion of ZTL-light to ZTL-dark can predict with reasonable certainty the extended delay in G80R and predicts distinct differences under LL conditions between the two proteins (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In this manner, it is clear that ZTL photocycle kinetics are instrumental in dictating delays in PRR5/TOC1 turnover and circadian period."

Adduct decay in ZTL then enhances degradation of PRR5 and TOC1, impacting circadian period through two methods: (1) Degradation of PRR5, helps diminish TOC1 levels through increased cytosolic retention and accessibility to ZTL (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 2010</a>) and (2) Degradation of cytosolic TOC1. Both factors require proper ZTL photocycle kinetics. Thus, LOV photocycle kinetics are instrumental in evolutionary selection for a 24 hr period."

Both equations are constructed of similar elements, a protein synthesis term defined by mRNA levels and a degradation term defined by PRR5/TOC1 protein levels, and in the case of TOC1 the total ZTL protein pool. We note, that ZTL protein levels are not incorporated into existing models of PRR5 degradation (<a href=\"#bib7\">De Caluw\u00e9 et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pokhilko et al., 2013</a>) suggesting that overexpression has a weak enough effect on the overall rate of PRR5 degradation that models lacking ZTL concentration can accurately predict degradation kinetics. Although biologically such an analysis is incomplete, for modeling purposes the accuracy of these prior models suggests this assumption is reasonably valid. Therefore, they normalize the ZTL concentration to one and it does not appear in the PRR5 degradation term. Further, in the fit parameters, p5\u00a0=\u00a01, which allows simplification as shown in <a href=\"#equ5\">Equation S4</a>, where c<sub>ZTL</sub> now equals the total pool of ZTL protein regardless of whether free or in complex with GI."

Examining Pokhilko <i>et al</i>. and De Caluwe <i>et al.</i> provides reasonable bounds for parameter estimation. First, PRR5 models suggest that PRR5 can be accurately modeled excluding differences in ZTL expression levels (<a href=\"#bib7\">De Caluw\u00e9 et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pokhilko et al., 2013</a>), this is consistent with our data showing that WT, WT-ox and G80R-ox all have the same decay rate under LL conditions despite differences in protein levels. Second, in De Caluwe <i>et al.</i> the maximum degradation rate constant for PRR5 degradation was fit as 0.78 hr<sup>\u22121</sup>. Similarly, in Pokhilko <i>et al</i>. a max value of 0.5 hr<sup>\u22121</sup> was obtained for PRR5 and a k<sub>max</sub> of 0.8 hr<sup>\u22121</sup> for TOC1 by combining all degradation terms. Given the similarity of these maximum values we chose a k<sub>max</sub> for the dark-state of 0.8 hr<sup>\u22121</sup>. The lowest fit rate constant in mathematical models is m<sub>6</sub> (0.2 hr<sup>\u22121</sup>) for TOC1 degradation under light-state conditions.

Data was scaled and reduced in HKL2000 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Otwinowski and Minor, 1997</a>) (see <a href=\"#equ3\">Equation S2</a> for refinement statistics). The initial WT structure was solved using molecular replacement in PHASER (<a href=\"#bib32\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>) and PHENIX (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>) with the LOV1 domain of <i>Arabidopsis</i> phototropin 2 (PDBID 2Z6D) as a search model.

All ZTL structures contain four molecules per asymmetric unit that is composed of two anti-parallel LOV dimers. Residues 29\u201331 are not visible in the electron density in any molecule. In several molecules residues 29\u201343 and 164\u2013165 are unable to be resolved and have not been built. For light-state structures clear density is observed for the adduct state in two of four molecules. Although electron density suggests an adduct for the remaining two molecules, we do not model them with an adduct and the reduced density likely reflects reduction by x-rays during data collection as has been observed previously (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zoltowski et al., 2007</a>)."
