In cardiac pacemaker cells, hetero-tetramer GIRK1/4 channels and homo-tetramer GIRK4 channels play a central role in parasympathetic slowing of heart rate. It is known that the Na<sup>+</sup> binding site of the GIRK1 subunit is defective, but the functional difference between GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers and GIRK4 homo-tetramers remains unclear. Here, using purified proteins and the lipid bilayer system, we characterize G\u03b2\u03b3 and Na<sup>+</sup> regulation of GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers and GIRK4 homo-tetramers. We find in GIRK4 homo-tetramers that Na<sup>+</sup> binding increases G\u03b2\u03b3 affinity and thereby increases the GIRK4 responsiveness to G protein stimulation. GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers are not activated by Na<sup>+</sup>, but rather are in a permanent state of high responsiveness to G\u03b2\u03b3, suggesting that the GIRK1 subunit functions like a GIRK4 subunit with Na<sup>+</sup> permanently bound."
