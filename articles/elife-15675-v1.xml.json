                    "text": "Color vision in birds is mediated by four types of cone photoreceptors whose maximal sensitivities (\u03bb<sub>max</sub>) are evenly spaced across the light spectrum. In the course of avian evolution, the \u03bb<sub>max</sub> of the most shortwave-sensitive cone, SWS1, has switched between violet (\u03bb<sub>max</sub> &gt; 400 nm) and ultraviolet (\u03bb<sub>max</sub> &lt; 380 nm) multiple times. This shift of the SWS1 opsin is accompanied by a corresponding short-wavelength shift in the spectrally adjacent SWS2 cone. Here, we show that SWS2 cone spectral tuning is mediated by modulating the ratio of two apocarotenoids, galloxanthin and 11\u2019,12\u2019-dihydrogalloxanthin, which act as intracellular spectral filters in this cell type. We propose an enzymatic pathway that mediates the differential production of these apocarotenoids in the avian retina, and we use color vision modeling to demonstrate how correlated evolution of spectral tuning is necessary to achieve even sampling of the light spectrum and thereby maintain near-optimal color discrimination."

In the course of avian evolution, the \u03bb<sub>max</sub> of the most shortwave-sensitive cone, SWS1, has switched between violet (\u03bb<sub>max</sub> &gt; 400 nm) and ultraviolet (\u03bb<sub>max</sub> &lt; 380 nm) multiple times. This shift of the SWS1 opsin is accompanied by a corresponding short-wavelength shift in the spectrally adjacent SWS2 cone. Here, we show that SWS2 cone spectral tuning is mediated by modulating the ratio of two apocarotenoids, galloxanthin and 11\u2019,12\u2019-dihydrogalloxanthin, which act as intracellular spectral filters in this cell type. We propose an enzymatic pathway that mediates the differential production of these apocarotenoids in the avian retina, and we use color vision modeling to demonstrate how correlated evolution of spectral tuning is necessary to achieve even sampling of the light spectrum and thereby maintain near-optimal color discrimination."

With this statement, he underscored the sophistication of the bird\u2019s eye, which surpasses our own in several respects. Compared to humans who have three types of cone photoreceptor, birds have four, meaning they can see an extra dimension of color. Birds precisely tune their violet-, blue-, green- and red-sensitive cones by coupling light-sensitive proteins with light-filtering pigments called carotenoids. This combination of sensors and filters increases the number of colors a bird can see."

This expansion of vision into the UV is complemented by a shift in the sensitivity of the blue cone photoreceptor. However, it is not well understood exactly how the sensitivity of the blue cone is shifted and how this shift impacts color vision."

This approach revealed that blue cone sensitivity is fine-tuned through a change in the chemical structure of the light-filtering carotenoid pigments within the photoreceptor. Computational models also indicated the sensitivity of the violet and blue cones must shift in a coordinated manner to maximize the number of colors a bird can see."

When the chromophore absorbs light, it changes conformation and initiates a signaling cascade. The peak spectral sensitivity of the visual pigment is determined by the amino acid composition of the opsin and the structure of the chromophore (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yokoyama, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bridges, 1972</a>). Color vision is achieved by comparing the stimulation of receptors that are maximally sensitive to different wavelengths of light (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goldsmith, 1990</a>), but overlap of the receptors\u2019 sensitivity spectra limits color discrimination (<a href=\"#bib22\">Govardovskii et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dyer, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Vorobyev and Osorio, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Vorobyev, 2003</a>). Birds have overcome this limitation by narrowing the spectral bandwidth of some of their photoreceptors through the use of a specialized optical organelle, the pigmented cone oil droplet (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a\u2013b</a>). These oil droplets are located in the path of light through the receptor and act as long-pass cutoff filters matched to the visual pigment sensitivity of each cone subtype. Light filtering by the droplet narrows the spectral bandwidth of receptor sensitivity, thereby reducing sensitivity overlap between spectrally adjacent cone types (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c\u2013d</a>). Theoretical considerations suggest that this adaptation enhances color discrimination and color constancy (<a href=\"#bib70\">Vorobyev, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Vorobyev et al., 1998</a>)."

In the course of avian evolution, the switch between violet and ultraviolet sensitivity has occurred at least 14 times (<a href=\"#bib47\">\u00d6deen and H\u00e5stad, 2013</a>). Although the selection pressures driving this switch are not well understood, the lability of this change likely reflects its relatively simple molecular basis. The essence of this switch is a short-wavelength shift in the peak sensitivity of the SWS1 opsin that can be mediated by as little as a single amino acid substitution (e.g. S90C) in the second transmembrane helix (<a href=\"#bib58\">Shi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Altun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hauser et al., 2014</a>). This short-wavelength shift of the SWS1 cone expands the spectral sensitivity of the visual system and is predicted to enhance color discrimination (<a href=\"#bib69\">Vorobyev et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cuthill et al., 2000</a>). However, a shift in the SWS1 cone alone disrupts the even spacing of receptor sensitivities across the visible spectrum and necessitates corresponding shifts in the sensitivity of the other single cone photoreceptors to maintain even spacing."

However, in contrast to the opsin-mediated shift of the SWS1 cone sensitivity, the spectral shift of the SWS2 cone is driven primarily by changes in the filtering of the C-type oil droplet (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hart and Vorobyev, 2005</a>). Among bird species, there is a strong positive correlation between the spectral sensitivity of the SWS1 opsin and the spectral cut-off wavelength of oil droplet filtering in the SWS2 cone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hart and Vorobyev, 2005</a>).

It has long been known that cone oil droplets are pigmented with carotenoids, a class of terpenoid molecules whose light absorption properties are determined by their degree of \u03c0-electron conjugation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Capranica, 1877</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Goldsmith et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ch\u00e1bera et al., 2009</a>). Birds cannot synthesize carotenoids <i>de novo</i> and must acquire them through their diet (<a href=\"#bib40\">McGraw, 2006</a>). However, birds can metabolize these diet-derived carotenoids to change their degree of conjugation and thereby shift their absorption spectrum toward longer or shorter wavelengths (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schiedt, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bhosale et al., 2007</a>)."

These molecules have relatively short systems of conjugation and specifically absorb short-wavelength light (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goldsmith et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Toomey et al., 2015</a>). In the violet-sensitive chicken (<i>Gallus gallus</i>), the C-type droplet contains primarily\u00a0galloxanthin with a peak absorbance at 402 nm as well as an apocarotenoid of undetermined structure (Apo2) with short-wavelength-shifted peak absorbance at 380 nm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Toomey et al., 2015</a>). Here, we hypothesized that the shift in the spectral tuning of the SWS2 cone between VS and UVS species is mediated by the differential accumulation of these two apocarotenoids in the C-type cone oil droplet. To test this hypothesis, we biochemically characterized the apocarotenoids in the retinas and cone oil droplets of VS and UVS species. We then investigated the metabolism of these apocarotenoid pigments and identified a putative enzymatic pathway for their production in the eye. We characterized the enzymatic activity and expression pattern of candidate components of this pathway. Finally, we used computational models of avian visual sensitivity and color discrimination to test the hypothesis that complementary shifts in C-type oil droplet filtering are necessary to realize the full functional potential of the VS to UVS switch of the SWS1 opsin."

Ozonolysis is expected to generate a diagnostic 251 dalton product if Apo2 is saturated at the 11\u2019,12\u2019 position.

We first evaluated the relative contributions of galloxanthin and dihydrogalloxanthin to the apocarotenoid composition of the whole retinas from a range of bird species. We examined the retinal apocarotenoid composition of 21 VS and 24 UVS species across eight avian orders using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). We found that the apocarotenoid ratio (dihydrogalloxanthin:galloxanthin) differed significantly between VS and UVS species (<i>F</i><sub>1,43</sub> = 22.32, p=2.48\u00a0x\u00a010<sup>\u22125</sup>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). UVS species tended to have higher levels of the short wavelength-shifted dihydrogalloxanthin in their retinas (dihydrogalloxanthin:galloxanthin ratio 0.81 \u00b1 0.09, mean \u00b1 SD; n = 21) compared to VS species (0.52 \u00b1 0.27, n = 24, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). However, this ratio was subject to strong phylogenetic inertia (Blomberg\u2019s K = 1.58, Pagel\u2019s \u03bb = 0.93, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This means that closely related species tend to have similar apocarotenoid compositions in their retinas and we must account for these correlations to properly assess the relationship between apocarotenoid composition and SWS1 opsin tuning. We therefore repeated the analysis to include phylogeny as part of the model and found that SWS1 opsin tuning remained a significant predictor of dihydrogalloxanthin:galloxanthin ratio (phylogenetic generalized linear model: p=0.012). Overall, these findings suggest that the evolution of the UVS opsin is associated with a relative increase in the concentrations of dihydrogalloxanthin compared to galloxanthin in the retina."

We found that the droplet spectra were not well matched by the spectrum of any individual apocarotenoid or carotenoid, suggesting that they consisted of complex mixtures of carotenoids (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). To deconvolve the individual droplet spectra and thereby estimate the exact carotenoid composition of the droplets, we used a linear additive model to find the combination of seven different apocarotenoid/carotenoid spectra that best fit the measured oil droplet spectra. These seven carotenoids used for modeling are the most abundant carotenoids found in the chicken retina (<a href=\"#bib61\">Toomey et al., 2015</a>). We previously showed that this method provides accurate estimates of the relative concentrations of carotenoids contained within isolated avian oil droplets (<a href=\"#bib61\">Toomey et al., 2015</a>). Using this approach, we were able fit the observed spectra of the C-type oil droplets of each species and explain &gt;98% of the variation (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2b\u2013e</a>). The fitted spectra consisted primarily of contributions from galloxanthin and dihydrogalloxanthin, with other carotenoid spectra each contributing 9% or less to the best fit. Consistent with our hypothesis, this analysis indicated that the C-type droplets of UVS species contain primarily dihydrogalloxanthin, while the droplets of the VS species contain primarily galloxanthin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d\u2013g</a>). Thus, birds appear to modulate the relative concentrations of galloxanthin and dihydrogalloxanthin in the C-type droplet to shift the spectral filtering of the SWS2 cone, thereby complementing the spectral tuning of the SWS1 cone. Modulation of the dihydrogalloxanthin: ratio within the SWS2 cone is likely to require controlled synthesis of these molecules from yolk or dietary precursor carotenoids (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schiedt, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bhosale et al., 2007</a>).

In this study, it was reported that a subpopulation of photoreceptors that included the double cones was significantly enriched for \u03b2-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO2), a known carotenoid cleavage enzyme (<a href=\"#bib15\">Enright et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kiefer et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mein et al., 2010</a>). Like the SWS2 cone, the\u00a0double cone contains\u00a0an\u00a0oil droplet pigmented with galloxanthin, thus we hypothesized that BCO2 might mediate the initial cleavage of zeaxanthin to 3-Hydroxy-10'-apo-\u03b2-caroten-10\u2019-al in the synthesis of galloxanthin. To test this hypothesis, we cloned chicken <i>BCO2</i> and expressed it in HEK293 cells. We then delivered a zeaxanthin substrate to the cells and characterized the resulting apocarotenoid products by HPLC. Consistent with our hypothesis, cells expressing BCO2 yielded a product consistent with , with a characteristic single absorbance peak at 449 nm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d\u2013e</a>)."

Further examination of the expression profiles of the LWS opsin-expressing photoreceptors revealed that retinol dehydrogenase 12 (RDH12) is the most highly expressed member of the RDH family (<a href=\"#bib15\">Enright et al., 2015a</a>).

Next, we sought to investigate if and how these shifts in the spectral filtering of the SWS2 cone influence visual function. We hypothesized that the sensitivity of the SWS2 cone is tuned to facilitate color discrimination and maintain spectral sensitivity across the light spectrum. To test the specific influence of C-type oil droplet filtering on color discrimination, we used a receptor noise-limited (RNL) model of color discrimination to predict the maximum number of discriminable colors for a range of hypothetical visual systems with varying C-type oil droplet spectral filtering (<a href=\"#bib70\">Vorobyev, 2003</a>). For this analysis, we used existing measurements of visual physiology from a diverse panel of 7 VS and 11 UVS bird species (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>) to predict how idealized spectra of light would stimulate the single cone photoreceptors of each species. With these predicted cone stimulations, we defined a tetrachromatic color space containing all possible spectra that could be encoded by the visual system. We then determined the total number of discriminable colors that could be contained within this space by partitioning it into volumes defined by the minimum distance in color space required to distinguish two spectra. For each species, we varied the C-type oil droplet spectral filtering cutoff (\u03bb<sub>cut</sub>) in 6 nm intervals across the spectrum from 370 to 500 nm, while holding all other parameters constant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a,b</a>), and predicted the total number of discriminable colors at each level of filtering.

When we mismatched the visual systems of VS species with the spectral filtering of UVS-like C-type droplets, our analysis predicted little change in discrimination across the spectrum (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6g</a>).

The best understood and arguably most important apocarotenoid in animal biology is retinal (the aldehyde form of vitamin A), which is the product of the symmetrical cleavage of \u03b2-carotene by beta-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1) (<a href=\"#bib66\">von Lintig, 2010</a>). Retinal is the chromophore of the photoreceptor visual pigment, and further oxidation of retinal yields retinoic acid, an essential regulator of gene expression during development (<a href=\"#bib66\">von Lintig, 2010</a>). In animals, the functional roles of asymmetric apocarotenoids such as galloxanthin are less well understood, but there is growing evidence that they may be involved in retinoic acid signaling and cancer in mammals (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eroglu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sharoni et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Harrison et al., 2012</a>). Our results demonstrate a specific functional role for asymmetric apocarotenoid products as UV spectral filters in the avian visual system.

The LWS cone contains a red droplet pigmented primarily with astaxanthin (13 conjugated double bonds). The MWS cone, has a yellow zeaxanthin-pigmented oil droplet (11 conjugated double bonds), and, as we show here, the SWS2 cone has an oil droplet containing a mixture of dihydrogalloxanthin and galloxanthin (7 or 8 conjugated double bonds, respectively) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Toomey et al., 2015</a>). All of these pigments are derived from dietary zeaxanthin through direct accumulation or metabolic modification (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bhosale et al., 2007</a>).

In contrast to the action of RETSAT (which eliminates a double bond from galloxanthin, thereby causing a short-wavelength shift in C-type oil droplet filtering), in many cold-blooded species the enzyme Cyp27c1 adds a double bond to retinal, thereby increasing the length of the conjugated system and producing a long-wavelength shift in light absorbance (<a href=\"#bib16\">Enright et al., 2015b</a>).

Despite this fact, generalized sets of visual system parameters for VS or UVS visual systems are often used to model how a specific bird species sees color signals, under the untested assumption that the visual systems are relatively invariant among VS or UVS species (e.g. (<a href=\"#bib3\">Avil\u00e9s and Soler, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Friedman and Reme\u0161, 2015</a>)). Our results indicate that an exclusive focus on opsin-based spectral tuning may offer an incomplete view of the spectral adaptations of the avian visual system. For example, a recent study of warblers from distinct genera and visual ecologies observed little variation in SWS1 and SWS2 opsin spectral sensitivities (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bloch et al., 2015</a>). However, adaption in these visual systems could be mediated through changes in filtering of the ocular media and oil droplets that are not apparent from measures of the opsins alone."

The VS-to-UVS switch in avian vision has become a model system for the integrated study of molecular, sensory, and signaling evolution with a specific focus on the SWS1 opsin (<a href=\"#bib45\">\u00d6deen and H\u00e5stad, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Shi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Friedman and Reme\u0161, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">H\u00e5stad et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">van Hazel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">\u00d6deen et al., 2012</a>). Our results present a more comprehensive picture of the functional adaptations that underlie this switch and reveal that the full potential of UVS vision is only realized when there are complementary changes in spectral filtering of the C-type oil droplet of the SWS2 cone, mediated by the selective accumulation of apocarotenoid pigments."

For each of our two traits of interest, we quantified phylogenetic inertia using Blomberg\u2019s K and Pagel\u2019s \u03bb, we tested Brownian motion versus Ornstein Uhlenbeck (OU) models of evolution (Brownian motion was favored by AICc in all instances), and we estimated ancestral states using maximum likelihood.

The RNL-model accounts for chromatic mechanisms, ignores achromatic signals, and postulates that detection is limited by photoreceptor noise. The model accounts for color opponent mechanisms. However, these can be left unspecified (as long as all receptors are compared) because discrimination is limited by receptor noise and not how photoreceptor output is combined (<a href=\"#bib69\">Vorobyev and Osorio, 1998</a>). Here follows a short model description while a comprehensive model outline was described earlier (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vorobyev et al., 2001</a>)."

A specific area of concern was the modeling of color discrimination. Two specific issues came up in this regard: (1) whether the model of cone noise is accurate; and (2) how the conclusions of the model depend on the spectra distribution of inputs. Because the modeling is an essential piece of the paper, and indeed one of the most novel aspects of the paper, these issues need to be dealt with directly. Specifically, it would be very helpful to know how the conclusions of the model depend on the assumptions upon which it is based. Detailed comments from each reviewer follow, including elaboration of the points above. We are including the full reviews so that you can see the convergence onto the essential points above."

But this appears inconsistent with direct measures of cone noise. Generally, intrinsic noise dominates total cone noise at low light levels. As light levels increase, a point is reached at which quantal fluctuations begin to contribute and in some cases dominate. This behavior is seen in Lamb and Simon (1977), Rieke and Baylor (2000), Angueyra and Rieke (2013). I suspect a noise model consistent with these measurements would alter the findings in the paper about the dependence of optimal spectral sampling on light level. If there is a solid justification for using a constant Weber fraction noise model that should be given in the context of what is known about the cones. If not, a model more in line with the cone measurements should be used."

Birds have been shown to have their shortwave-sensitive pigments (SWS1) tuned either to the violet (VS) or the ultraviolet (UVS) spectrum and this SWS1 shift is accompanied by a same direction shift in the tuning of SWS2 pigments. Colour vision in birds is achieved by the presence of 4 types of cone opsins but is also regulated by the presence of oil droplets in cone photoreceptors. In this study, the authors demonstrate that the SWS2 tuning shift is mediated by modulating the ratio of 2 carotenoids (dihydrogalloxanthin and galloxanthin) present in the oil droplet found in SWS2 cones. They elucidate the molecular structure and identity of one of these carotenoids which was previously unknown and go on to report the ratio of these two carotenoids in 21 and 24 species of VS and UVS birds, respectively, showing a correlation between the ratios, SWS2 tuning and VS/UVS pigments. They show that shorter shifted SWS2 pigments are found in UVS species and have a higher amount of dihydrogalloxanthin while VS species have more galloxanthin. They then further investigate the possible enzymatic pathway from where dietary zeaxanthin is converted to dihydrogalloxanthin and galloxanthin through a 3-step enzymatic process. They show in vitro evidence that their proposed pathway can generate these 2 carotenoids and further confirm expression of the enzymes in the avian retina during development. Finally, creating a modelling system of the avian UVS and VS visual system, Toomey and colleagues were able to investigate the role of the complementary SWS1 tuning and SWS2 oil-droplets in colour discrimination in both VS and UVS species."

Because the modeling is an essential piece of the paper, and indeed one of the most novel aspects of the paper, these issues need to be dealt with directly.

This behavior is seen in Lamb and Simon (1977), Rieke and Baylor (2000), Angueyra and Rieke (2013).

In both dim and very dim conditions the model predictions are substantially short-wavelength shifted relative to the observed values. A short-wavelength shift in C-type droplet filtering increases spectral overlap between the SWS2 and SWS1 cones, but also increases the quantum catch of the receptors. As we have modeled the dim and very dim conditions, the benefit of increased quantum catch outweighs the cost of increased spectral overlap because the discrimination thresholds are directly dependent on intensity. Together these results indicate that in the diurnal species we examine, spectral filtering of the C-type oil droplets is fine-tuned for color discrimination in bright light conditions where discrimination thresholds display Weber-like behavior."

The shift of the \u03bb<sub>max</sub> of SWS1 opsin from VS to UVS can be affected by as little as a single amino acid change in the opsin (S90C). In fact, this amino acid substitution can be brought about by a single nucleotide change at the DNA level. For this reason, the VS to UVS shift is easily \u2018accessible\u2019 in an evolutionary sense. The S90C substitution is predicted to cause deprotonation of the chromophore Schiff-base linkage in the opsin (Carvalho et al. 2007, Mol. Bio. Evol. 24:183, Altun et al. 2011, ACS Chem. Biol. 6:775). This deprotonation results in a large blue-shift in the peak spectral sensitivity that dwarfs more subtle shifts brought about by other changes in the opsin. Therefore, the evolution of intermediate tunings may be constrained by the photochemistry of the visual pigment."
