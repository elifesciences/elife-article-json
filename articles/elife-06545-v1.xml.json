This arrangement is the result of coordinated cell movements, cell shape changes and the organisation of pigment cells during metamorphosis. Iridophores play a crucial part in this process by switching between the dense form of the light stripes and the loose form of the dark stripes. Adult <i>schachbrett</i> (<i>sbr</i>) mutants exhibit delayed changes in iridophore shape and organisation caused by truncations in Tight Junction Protein 1a (ZO-1a). In <i>sbr</i> mutants, the dark stripes are interrupted by dense iridophores invading as coherent sheets. Immuno-labelling and chimeric analyses indicate that Tjp1a is expressed in dense iridophores, but down-regulated in the loose form. Tjp-1a is a novel regulator of cell shape changes during colour pattern formation and the first cytoplasmic protein implicated in this process."
