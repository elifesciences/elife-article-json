We recently reported that rodent malaria parasites infect erythroblasts that express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens, which are recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contributes to the protection of mice against blood-stage malaria in a Fas ligand (FasL)-dependent manner. Erythroblasts infected with malarial parasites express the death receptor Fas. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells induce the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the infected erythroblasts in a cell-to-cell contact-dependent manner. PS enhances the engulfment of the infected erythroid cells by phagocytes. As a PS receptor, T-cell immunoglobulin-domain and mucin-domain-containing molecule 4 (Tim-4) contributes to the phagocytosis of malaria-parasite-infected cells. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective immunity exerted by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in collaboration with phagocytes."

We recently reported that rodent malaria parasites infect erythroblasts that express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens, which are recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contributes to the protection of mice against blood-stage malaria in a Fas ligand (FasL)-dependent manner. Erythroblasts infected with malarial parasites express the death receptor Fas. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells induce the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the infected erythroblasts in a cell-to-cell contact-dependent manner. PS enhances the engulfment of the infected erythroid cells by phagocytes. As a PS receptor, T-cell immunoglobulin-domain and mucin-domain-containing molecule 4 (Tim-4) contributes to the phagocytosis of malaria-parasite-infected cells. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective immunity exerted by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in collaboration with phagocytes."

The infected cells display a protein called Fas on their surface. Imai et al. found that, during a malaria infection, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells produce a protein that can interact with Fas. This interaction causes the infected cell to move a signaling molecule to its outside surface, which encourages another type of immune cell to engulf and destroy the infected cell.

With the spread of drug-resistant parasites and the lack of effective vaccines, malaria is a serious global health problem, especially in developing countries. To develop malarial vaccines, it is necessary to understand the protective immune response against malaria. However, because the malaria parasite successfully evades the host immune responses (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hisaeda et al., 2004</a>), it is difficult to identify the truly important immune responses, hindering the development of a malarial vaccine (<a href=\"#bib12\">Good and Engwerda, 2011</a>)."

However, the contribution of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to this protection remains controversial because there are no major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens on human erythrocytes infected with the malaria parasite. Some studies have shown that infection of BALB/c mice with non-lethal <i>Plasmodium yoelii</i> was controlled even after depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells comparable to control mice (<a href=\"#bib49\">Vinetz et al., 1990</a>).

The transfer of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice cured of PyNL infection into <i>Rag2</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> or irradiated recipients, followed by two boosts with PyL, conferred protection against PyL. The major protective mechanism of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is the interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3)-dependent activation of phagocytes, resulting in the enhanced phagocytosis of parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs). The cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also contributes to protecting the host against blood-stage malaria. However, the target cells of this cytotoxicity and how this cytotoxicity acts against blood-stage malaria are as yet unknown. Although recent reports have demonstrated that the human malaria parasites <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> parasitize erythroblasts (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ru et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Tamez et al., 2009</a>), the host response and protective immunity against these parasitized erythroblasts are unclear. We have reported that PyNL parasites also infect erythroblasts that express MHC class I molecules on their surfaces and that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells produce IFN-\u03b3 in response to parasitized erythroblasts in an antigen-specific manner. These results suggest that parasitized erythroblasts are the targets of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells."

This suggests that CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have different effector mechanisms for parasite clearance, and that the protective immunity mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is important in controlling infection during the early phase, within the period of peak parasitemia. Therefore, the following analyses were conducted 7\u20138 days after infection, when the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells might be activated in response to the parasite, and 16\u201318 days after infection, when the parasites begin to be eliminated."

However, this is unlikely because infection did not increase the expression of FasL on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, in contrast to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). To confirm these inferences, we used cell transfer experiments combined with a prime\u2013boost live vaccination system in which CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from mice that had recovered from PyNL infection after two homologous boosts with PyL transferred protection from an otherwise lethal infection with PyL to the recipient mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Imai et al., 2010</a>).

CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells obtained from \u2018immune\u2019 CD45.1-bearing C57BL/6 mice could transfer protection to <i>Rag2</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice (CD45.2), although parasitemia was greater compared with when the irradiated mice were used as hosts (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">Imai et al., 2010</a>). In such lymphopenic recipients, a very few cells proliferate intensively and acquire effector capacities. Thus, the homeostatic proliferation of contaminants other than CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was evaluated. The ratio of the contaminated CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in sorted CD8<sup>+</sup> cells used for the transfer was less than 0.1% (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). That in donor-derived CD45.1<sup>+</sup> cells recovered from the recipients did not exceed 0.8%, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells constantly occupied more than 96% even after infection with PyNL (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>).

FasL interacts with Fas expressed on target cells, inducing the apoptosis of the Fas-expressing cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nagata and Golstein, 1995</a>). Recently, erythroid cells have been reported to express Fas (<a href=\"#bib4\">De Maria et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tsushima et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mandal et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2006</a>). Based on our previous finding that malaria parasites infect erythroblasts (<a href=\"#bib19\">Imai et al., 2013</a>). We postulated that infected erythroid cells are the targets of FasL-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of Fas on infected erythroid cells in the spleens and peripheral blood of mice infected with PyNL\u2013green fluorescent protein (GFP). Very few TER119<sup>+</sup> erythroid cells expressed Fas in the peripheral blood, even among the infected GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In contrast, a number of infected GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressing Fas were present in the spleen, and the frequency of those cells among the parasitized cells reached 50% before peak parasitemia (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). To identify the erythroid cells that express Fas in the spleen, we examined the expression of MHC class I molecules on the infected cells because erythroblasts are distinguished from reticulocytes and mature RBCs by their high-level expression of MHC class I antigens (<a href=\"#bib19\">Imai et al., 2013</a>). Almost all Fas-expressing cells, both infected and uninfected, were MHC class I<sup>hi</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), indicating that the infected Fas<sup>+</sup> cells were erythroblasts. As those cells present antigens in conjunction with MHC class I molecules and are recognized antigen-specifically by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Imai et al., 2013</a>), it is possible that FasL-bearing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells affect infected erythroblasts expressing Fas. Notably, the infection of erythroblasts with PyNL may induce their expression of Fas, because Fas<sup>\u2212</sup> erythroblasts were markedly reduced in the infected cells relative to their numbers in uninfected cells (41% and 14%, respectively; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Moreover, the intensity of Fas expression was much higher on parasitized erythroblasts than in uninfected erythroblasts."

PS-displaying infected RBCs are more susceptible to phagocytosis, and this phenomenon is involved in the protection of the host from malaria. Therefore, we investigated whether PS is exposed on erythroid cells in response to the FasL\u2013Fas interaction during malaria (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

The addition of FasL\u2013<i>Strep</i> induced the externalization of PS in infected GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Because the Fas-expressing cells in the spleen were erythroblasts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), we confirmed that FasL\u2013<i>Strep</i> induced erythroblasts to expose PS.

It has also been reported that PS-exposing cells are highly susceptible to phagocytosis by macrophages (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fadok et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">van den Eijnde et al., 1998</a>). These findings led us to hypothesize that PS exposure on infected cells, induced by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, accelerates their engulfment by phagocytes such as macrophages. To test this hypothesis in vitro, infected cells were isolated from CD8<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-deleted, <i>gld</i>, and WT control mice infected with PyNL. The degree of PS exposure was different in each preparation. Those cells were then labeled and cocultured with macrophages from uninfected mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Only a few macrophages phagocytosed the uninfected cells, whereas up to 30% of macrophages engulfed the infected cells from the WT mice. When cocultured with infected cells from CD8<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-depleted WT or <i>gld</i> mice, the number of phagocytotic macrophages was significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). A positive correlation between the degree of PS exposure on the infected cells and the numbers of phagocytotic macrophages was observed, indicating that PS<sup>+</sup> cells are readily phagocytosed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>)."

We have previously shown that the proportion of infected erythroblasts is constant during the course of infection, unlike the proportion of infected RBCs, which increases dramatically in the later stages of infection (<a href=\"#bib19\">Imai et al., 2013</a>). This means that there are relatively more infected erythroblasts in the early stage of infection. Therefore, the reduction of infected erythroblasts by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the early phase would efficiently control blood-stage malaria. From this perspective, this protective mechanism might effectively control malaria parasites in humans, in which parasitemia develops to a lower level than that observed in animal models. Indeed, parasitized erythroblasts were found within the bone marrow of patients with vivax malaria (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ru et al., 2009</a>), and <i>P. falciparum</i> parasites (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tamez et al., 2009</a>) can infect erythroblasts in vitro. Therefore, these cells might be targets of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in humans. It will be very interesting to evaluate whether parasitized erythroblasts are phagocytosed in the human bone marrow or spleen (although this will be difficult to demonstrate experimentally)."

There are two possible explanations for the expression of Fas on infected erythroblasts. One is that the infection of Fas<sup>\u2212</sup> erythroblasts with the malaria parasite induces the expression of Fas. Our findings support this because Fas<sup>\u2212</sup> erythroblasts were markedly reduced in infected cells compared with their numbers in uninfected cells, indicating a transition from Fas<sup>\u2212</sup> to Fas<sup>+</sup> cells upon infection. However, the precise mechanism of this induction of Fas remains to be clarified. The other possible explanation is that the malaria parasite infects Fas<sup>+</sup> erythroblasts. Erythroblasts are known to express Fas under physiological conditions, and Fas is considered to be involved in the negative regulation of erythropoiesis (<a href=\"#bib4\">De Maria et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, uninfected Fas<sup>+</sup> erythroblasts were found in mice infected with PyNL. Activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing FasL might interact with uninfected erythroblasts expressing Fas and induce bystander cell damage during infection, and this system may underlie the pathogenicity of malarial anemia."

Do CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contact their target cells in the spleen? As CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and erythroblasts occur in the splenic white pulp and red pulp, respectively (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mebius and Kraal, 2005</a>), the opportunity for contact between them might be limited. However, infection with the malaria parasite changes the structure of the spleen and makes the white pulp indistinguishable from the red pulp (<a href=\"#bib5\">Del Portillo et al., 2012</a>). Thus, it is possible that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contact erythroblasts in the spleens of mice infected with PyNL. In vivo imaging would be useful in confirming this, because imaging has recently shown that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells accumulate in the liver after sporozoite infection (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kimura et al., 2013</a>)."

Unlike viruses, malaria parasites can multiply inside RBCs but may not require any cellular machinery for their replication, suggesting that the apoptosis of the host cells may not influence parasite growth. Indeed, a related protozoan, <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, can survive inside damaged host cells (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yamashita et al., 1998</a>). Instead, the elimination of the malaria parasite may require the phagocytosis of the infected cells by the phagocytes of the reticuloendothelial system, and the externalization of PS on parasitized erythroblasts via Fas/FasL plays an important role in this process. PS acts as an \u2018eat me\u2019 signal for phagocytes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Savill and Gregory, 2007</a>) and contributes to the rapid removal of infected erythroblasts and apoptotic cells. Erythroblasts are distributed in a specific region called the \u2018erythroblastic island\u2019 in the splenic red pulp. Macrophages are located in the center of the erythroblastic island and rapidly phagocytose the nuclei of erythroblasts after their enucleation under physiological conditions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chasis and Mohandas, 2008</a>). These macrophages may rapidly engulf infected erythroblasts as soon as PS is exposed after their interaction with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells."

Although PS exposure on infected RBCs induced by Fas stimulation could not be reproduced in vitro coincident with the absence of Fas<sup>+</sup> cells in the peripheral blood, we observed a substantial number of infected PS<sup>+</sup> RBCs in the peripheral blood. One possible explanation for FasL-dependent PS exposure on infected Fas<sup>\u2212</sup> RBCs is that infected erythroblasts exposing PS develop into RBCs after enucleation, which is associated with the shedding of MHC class I molecules. PS exposure on infected RBCs has been reported in response to several stressors during malaria (<a href=\"#bib9\">Foller et al., 2009</a>), and the FasL- and CD8<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-dependent system might be one cause of this PS exposure.

However, infection with PyNL induced the expression of Tim-4 on macrophages, which may play a major role in the phagocytosis of infected cells during malarial infection.

Our findings should provide novel strategies for the development of a blood-stage vaccine based on the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, distinct from those strategies based on the induction of antibodies. Antigens recognized by antibodies must be expressed on the parasite's surface. Such molecules are exposed to immune pressure and acquire polymorphisms, allowing them to evade antibody recognition and causing \u2018strain-specific immunity\u2019, which hampers the development of effective vaccines. In contrast, antigens recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are not restricted in their locations, and conserved intracellular molecules could be recognized after antigen presentation. Therefore, the development of malaria vaccines that activate protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells against blood-stage malaria might be useful and have wide applications."

The depletion of splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in malaria-infected mice is shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>. The protocols for the prime\u2013boost live vaccination and cell transfer are shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated from WT and <i>gld</i> mice infected with PyNL (25,000 pRBC) after two boosts with PyL (50,000 pRBC) at 6 and 9 weeks after the primary PyNL infection. Then, 1 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> purified cells were transferred to recipient x-ray-irradiated (5.5 Gy) mice or <i>Rag2</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice. The recipients were infected with PyL (50,000 pRBC) 1 week after cell transfer."

Following coculture, the noningested RBCs were removed with ACK lysing buffer. The capacity of macrophages to phagocytize CFSE-labeled pRBCs or normal RBCs was analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer.

Immunol., 2010), which is also described in the Introduction section in the original version of the manuscript. In the present study, however, the remaining CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may also produce IFN-\u03b3 after depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In fact, macrophages were activated in response to infection with PyNL even in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-depleted animals as indicated by higher expression of MHC class I and class II (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). These results support our proposal that the impaired phagocytosis in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-depleted mice is not due to insufficient activation of macrophages but due to the reduction of PS<sup>+</sup> infected erythroid cells."

To compensate for the lack of in vivo evidence, in vitro experiments have been performed and revealed that infected TER119<sup>+</sup> cells from the spleen, but not peripheral blood, externalized PS when co-cultured with effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). We also reported previously that effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are directly activated by infected erythroid cells in an antigen-specific manner using OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that recognize OVA peptide in conjunction with H-2K<sup>b</sup> and OVA-expressing PyNL parasites (see Imai et al, Sci. Rep., 2013). We therefore believe that direct antigen-specific activation operates, at least partially, during CD8<sup>+</sup>-T-cell-mediated protection."
