Here, we describe two independent genetic screens for <i>rsc</i> suppressors that yielded mutations in the promoter-focused ISW1a complex or mutations in the \u2018basic patch\u2019 of histone H4 (an epitope that regulates ISWI activity), strongly supporting RSC-ISW1a antagonism in vivo. RSC and ISW1a largely co-localize, and genomic nucleosome studies using <i>rsc isw1</i> mutant combinations revealed opposing functions: promoters classified with a nucleosome-deficient region (NDR) gain nucleosome occupancy in <i>rsc</i> mutants, but this gain is attenuated in <i>rsc isw1</i> double mutants. Furthermore, promoters lacking NDRs have the highest occupancy of both remodelers, consistent with regulation by nucleosome occupancy, and decreased transcription in <i>rsc</i> mutants. Taken together, we provide the first genetic and genomic evidence for RSC-ISW1a antagonism and reveal different mechanisms at two different promoter architectures."

Here, we describe two independent genetic screens for <i>rsc</i> suppressors that yielded mutations in the promoter-focused ISW1a complex or mutations in the \u2018basic patch\u2019 of histone H4 (an epitope that regulates ISWI activity), strongly supporting RSC-ISW1a antagonism in vivo. RSC and ISW1a largely co-localize, and genomic nucleosome studies using <i>rsc isw1</i> mutant combinations revealed opposing functions: promoters classified with a nucleosome-deficient region (NDR) gain nucleosome occupancy in <i>rsc</i> mutants, but this gain is attenuated in <i>rsc isw1</i> double mutants. Furthermore, promoters lacking NDRs have the highest occupancy of both remodelers, consistent with regulation by nucleosome occupancy, and decreased transcription in <i>rsc</i> mutants. Taken together, we provide the first genetic and genomic evidence for RSC-ISW1a antagonism and reveal different mechanisms at two different promoter architectures."

The chromatin is relaxed in these regions, which allows the proteins that activate genes to access the DNA. This effect is partially counteracted by the ISWI complex, which repositions nucleosomes across the promoters to fill the gaps created by the RSC complex."

Thus, these two chromatin remodelers, ISWI and RSC, compete at promoters to determine whether they contain or lack nucleosomes, which helps determine whether the gene is silent or active, respectively. Future work will look further at how the \u2018winner\u2019 is determined: how transcription factors or signaling systems within the cell bias the recruitment or activity of RSC or ISWI at particular promoters, to determine gene activity."

In yeast, the RSC chromatin-remodeling complex is an essential and abundant paralog of the canonical SWI/SNF remodeler (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cairns et al., 1996</a>). The central subunit of RSC, Sth1, is a DNA-dependent ATPase that translocates DNA, pumping DNA around the surface of a nucleosome, and effectively mobilizing the nucleosome with respect to the underlying sequence (<a href=\"#bib48\">Saha et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2005</a>). This property enables RSC to shift nucleosome positions, as well as completely eject nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lorch et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boeger et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dechassa et al., 2010</a>). In vivo, RSC facilitates transcription by all three RNA polymerases, primarily by enabling promoter access (<a href=\"#bib44\">Parnell et al., 2008</a>). RSC maintains proper promoter chromatin structure, as RSC mutants exhibit alterations in nucleosome occupancy and spacing at promoters (<a href=\"#bib4\">Badis et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ganguli et al., 2014</a>). RSC activity appears regulated, in part, by the presence of histone modifications (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kasten et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Ferreira et al., 2007</a>). RSC contains seven bromodomains on four subunits, implying a key role of acetylation in regulation. Thus, gene activation often involves the recruitment and activation of remodelers such as RSC to act on specific modified nucleosomes and promote promoter accessibility. The converse of gene activation, silencing, is expected to be the reverse process, where nucleosomes are re-positioned and organized to occlude transcription factor access."

We then introduced <i>TRP1</i>-marked plasmids containing hydroxylamine mutagenized <i>HHT2-HHF2</i> genes and screened for suppression of the temperature sensitivity phenotype upon loss of the wild-type histone plasmid (using 5-FOA negative selection). From 20,000 transformants screened, we isolated seventeen suppressors that were verified by isolating and retransforming the plasmid containing the histone mutation. Of these, most contained single mutations: eight had either H3 A7V or H3 A7T mutations, seven had an H3 T6I mutation, and one bore an H3 G33V mutation. However, one mutant bore an H4 RH17,18CY double mutation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). All of these histone mutations were also tested for suppression of other temperature-sensitive RSC alleles, including <i>rsc2-D461G</i>, <i>rsc2-Y337H</i>, and <i>rsc4-2</i>, and each was suppressed (data not shown), suggesting that these mutations generally suppress RSC defects and not a specific defect of <i>rsc2-V457M</i>.

As RSC contains several bromodomains and may be regulated by histone acetylation (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib28\">Josling et al., 2012</a>), we considered whether loss of H4 K16 acetylation may underlie the suppression. However, no H4 K16 acetylation was detected by Western blot in the H4 RH17,18CY mutant, but this could either be the result of loss of acetylation or failure of the antibody to recognize the mutated epitope. We therefore combined <i>rsc2-V457M</i> with H4 K16Q, H4 K16R, and H4 K16G mutants to determine if loss of K16 acetylation was responsible for the suppression. However, combining these mutants resulted in a slight synthetic sickness instead of suppression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), ruling out this simple model."

To directly test <i>isw1</i> mutant suppression of <i>rsc2</i> alleles, we combined <i>rsc2-V457M</i> or <i>rsc2-D461G</i> with <i>isw1</i>\u0394 and observed partial suppression of temperature sensitivity and a set of phenotypes associated with the drugs benomyl and formamide (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) as well as 6-azauracil (6AU) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Growth suppression of the double mutant was lost when <i>ISW1</i> was restored through plasmid transformation.

Furthermore, when we combined <i>rsc2-V457M</i> with both <i>isw1</i>\u0394 and H4 RH17,18CY, no enhanced suppression was observed (data not shown), suggesting that they act through the same pathway. We also directly tested whether the <i>ISWI</i> paralog, <i>ISW2</i>, might also suppress <i>rsc2</i> alleles. Combining the <i>isw2</i>\u0394 mutation with <i>rsc2-V457M</i> or <i>rsc2-D461G</i> did not confer suppression of the temperature growth defect, although some partial suppression of other phenotypes was observed (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

We identified 137 or 230 Pol II promoters at an FDR of 1% or 5%, respectively. Strikingly, 224 of these latter promoters also pass the 1% threshold for RSC enrichment. Visual comparison of the enrichment pattern (log2 fold ChIP/Input) across all Pol II promoters reveals a high degree of overlap (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), while a pairwise plot between the RSC and ISWI mean fold enrichment values at the TSS shows a positive correlation (r = 0.6; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This enrichment also extends beyond Pol II promoters, as we observed high ISW1a occupancy at both ncRNA and tRNA genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We did not observe significant enrichment of ISW1a at centromeres, although we note that ISW2 is enriched at centromeres (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</a>), which may provide any requisite ISWI function at these loci.

This transcription attenuation, as well as any suppression by ISWI, should be evident by expression analysis. To determine whether this suppression is global in nature or restricted to a subset of genes, we performed a HybMap analysis on a sampling of genes in the genome. The HybMap technique measures both sense and anti-sense RNA levels across a genome (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dutrow et al., 2008</a>), providing results that are comparable to RNA-Seq (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ni et al., 2010</a>). The advantage of this technique is the direct use of total RNA (enabling the detection of transcripts lacking polyA) without RNA labeling and/or amplification protocols to obtain absolute expression levels. Although the format restricted our array to 649 genes, it included a large fraction of genes occupied by RSC (84%), both RSC and ISW1 (9%), or unoccupied (16%), using an FDR threshold of 1%. We performed this analysis on <i>rsc2-V457M</i>, <i>isw1</i>\u0394, <i>ioc3</i>\u0394, <i>rsc2-V457M isw1</i>\u0394, and <i>rsc2-V457M ioc3</i>\u0394 strains and compared them to wild type."

Interestingly, individual <i>ioc3</i> or <i>isw1</i> mutants also lowered mean expression but with less magnitude. However, neither the <i>rsc2 ioc3</i> nor the <i>rsc2 isw1</i> double mutants generally suppressed the <i>rsc2</i> effect by restoring global gene expression. Furthermore, we saw little change among tRNA genes from any genotype and no measureable change in anti-sense transcription levels (data not shown). We also did not observe general aberrant transcription from promoters as reported previously in an <i>rsc3</i> mutant (<a href=\"#bib61\">van Bakel et al., 2013</a>). These results suggest that the suppression of RSC phenotypes is not due to a global effect on gene expression but rather due to an effect at a subset of genes. To see if such genes could be identified from our sampling, we selected genes whose expression was at least partially restored by combining <i>rsc2</i> with <i>isw1</i> or <i>ioc3</i> mutations. This analysis revealed 20 genes (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which included genes for ribosome function, snoRNA genes, and several essential genes. It is likely that the combined modest change in expression at these and other genes are responsible for the suppression relationship observed."

Loss of RSC results in a gain of nucleosome occupancy at the nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) commonly found near the TSS of genes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Badis et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Parnell et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ganguli et al., 2014</a>). We therefore constructed strains that included the <i>sth1</i><sup><i>td</i></sup> degron allele in combination with an <i>isw1\u0394</i> allele. Implementation of the <i>sth1</i><sup><i>td</i></sup> allele allows for precise inducible destruction of the catalytic subunit of RSC, thus abrogating all RSC catalytic function\u2014which we subsequently term \u2018rsc\u0394\u2019 in figures and text. We chose to use both the RSC and <i>isw1</i> null alleles to maximize the nucleosomal effects due to the loss of catalytic activity in a manner that mutations in regulatory subunits may not. Mono-nucleosomal DNA was isolated from these yeast strains after inducing the degron allele for 2 hr and analyzed by both high-resolution microarray (rsc\u0394 and <i>isw1</i>\u0394) and paired-end sequencing (rsc\u0394 only). As a reference, we also analyzed mono-nucleosomal DNA from control strains that cannot degrade Sth1 protein. To analyze the chromatin structure around the TSS, we generated nucleosome profiles around the TSS for every promoter by scoring the nucleosomal occupancy for rsc\u0394 and RSC strains. Promoters were organized into clusters based on their rsc\u0394/RSC ratio profile using a k-means algorithm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). For each cluster, the mean nucleosome profile of both strains was then generated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) (We note that the clusters in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> bear no relationship to the clustering analysis in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, which instead shows similarity in loci occupied by RSC or ISWI)."

The loss of RSC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) resulted in two major categories: (1) clusters 1\u20134 all share strong changes in nucleosome positioning following the loss of RSC and (2) clusters 5 and 6 show a weak response to the loss of RSC. Closer examination revealed further differences in each category. For example, the cluster 1 rsc<i>\u0394</i> profile shows a dramatic gain in nucleosome occupancy over the NDR at the expense of the +1 nucleosome relative to the control RSC profile, consistent with prior work (see \u2018Discussion\u2019). There is also a clear \u2018leftward\u2019 shift in nucleosome positions over the body of the gene, towards the NDR. This nucleosome shift is particularly prominent in clusters 3 and 4, while the NDR is filled into a lesser extent and the +1 nucleosome peak is not as depleted (compared to cluster 1). To confirm that these effects were not due to limitations in the sensitivity and resolution of microarray analyses, the nucleosome profiles from the microarray data were directly compared to those from the sequencing analysis (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Nucleosome profiles of the same clusters show remarkable similarity between those derived from array and sequence, validating our approaches and conclusions. Taken together, the filling of the NDR and a strong \u2018leftward\u2019 shift of the +1 nucleosome toward the NDR are consistent features that follow loss of RSC function."

Loss of <i>ISW1</i> results in modest nucleosomal changes, most notably within the promoter-proximal 5\u2032 coding region, either as changes in density or phasing, and minimal impact at the NDR. While loss of <i>ISW1</i> alone has been shown to result in nucleosomal shifts towards the TSS (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tirosh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">van Bakel et al., 2013</a>), these shifts, discernable in cluster 3, are much smaller and more restricted than those generated by the loss of RSC (compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>). Importantly, in the double mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), the nucleosomal profiles are more similar to wild type than rsc\u0394 alone.

Clusters 1\u20134 display a prototypical promoter nucleosomal architecture (\u22121, NDR, and +1 nucleosome). In contrast, clusters 5 and 6 lack this stereotypical organization; here, RSC and/or ISW1a may indeed impact nucleosome occupancy and/or positioning, but the effect may be obscured due to architectural heterogeneity. Notably, these two types of architectures have previously been designated as open (or structured) vs closed (or unstructured) and have been largely correlated with either constitutive or highly regulated gene types, respectively (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tirosh and Barkai, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cairns, 2009</a>). We verified these classifications by plotting the mean nucleosome prediction (<a href=\"#bib53\">Segal et al., 2006</a>) for each of these clusters (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). While the predictive power for individual nucleosome positions was weak, the algorithm predicted the depth and breadth of NDRs fairly accurately. The strongly responsive clusters 1\u20134 had a well-defined NDR prediction, matching the observed profile, while the weakly responsive clusters 5 and 6 showed a broad shallow NDR. Since nucleosome phasing is, in part, determined by how well the \u22121 and +1 nucleosomes are positioned flanking the NDR, this result matches well with the general lack of consistent phasing across clusters 5 and 6 gene bodies. Interestingly, cluster 3 does not show as strong a predictive NDR as clusters 1, 2, and 4, which may partly explain why this cluster shows nucleosomal shifts in both <i>isw1</i>\u0394 and rsc\u0394 and weak suppression in the double mutant. Taken together, structured/open promoters show the strongest response to RSC loss, whereas unstructured/closed promoters lack a strong response\u2014though we note that the lack of a uniform structure may obscure the response (see \u2018Discussion\u2019)."

Using our HybMap RNA expression data as a proxy for transcriptional impact, we scored genes from each category for expression. We note, however, that the differences between the HybMap and nucleosome experiments in several parameters, for example, RSC mutation vs depletion, time points, and representation among clusters (see <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), place limitations on these comparisons. Nevertheless, while all promoter classes showed reduced gene expression in <i>rsc2</i> mutants (consistent with <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), cluster 2 and especially clusters 5 and 6 (the two \u2018closed\u2019 promoter clusters) were most severely negatively impacted (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The inclusion of cluster 2 with clusters 5 and 6 is intriguing; however, it is also the only structured cluster to exhibit significant nucleosome occupancy gain over the body of the gene in rsc\u0394, which is likely related to the reduction in transcription. These impacts are not simply correlated with the level of gene expression, as the distribution of wild-type expression values between clusters is highly consistent (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similar to what we observed previously, the <i>isw1\u0394</i> mutants showed little impact on the bulk expression of these genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We also examined the chromatin structure of the 17 Pol II-transcribed genes where ISW1a loss provided significant suppression of <i>rsc2</i>\u0394 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, the moderate resolution provided by the microarray format limited the fine mapping of nucleosomes, preventing our ability to identify nucleosomes that might be directly responsible for suppression (data not shown). These 17 genes partitioned slightly more to closed (nine genes) than the more common open promoter structures (eight genes). Together, these results suggest that while the clearest effects on nucleosome positioning (restoration in <i>isw1\u0394</i>) are seen with \u2018open\u2019 promoters, the largest effects on transcription are more closely associated with \u2018closed\u2019 promoters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

We plotted the mean profile of measured histone turnover rate (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rufiange et al., 2007</a>) over the six gene clusters and found that the degree of histone turnover correlated well with remodeler occupancy, with cluster 6 having the highest turnover, particularly around and upstream of the TSS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

The gene clusters with the greatest measurable impact on chromatin organization due to RSC loss, groups 1\u20134, represent the open promoters, whereas groups 5 and 6 represent closed promoters, which collectively lack a distinctive organization and therefore a measurable impact. These promoter architectures matched well with the predictions of remodeler occupancy and histone turnover (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tirosh and Barkai, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cairns, 2009</a>). These architectures are also predicted to correlate with specific DNA sequence characteristics and nucleosome composition. For example, open promoters typically contain nucleosome exclusion sequences clustered with binding sites for factors that may help exclude or reposition nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Segal et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Badis et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</a>). To verify these, we scored promoters for the presence of TATA, Reb1, and Rsc3 binding sites, as well as the number of AAAAA sequences, which antagonize nucleosome formation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kaplan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Segal and Widom, 2009</a>). We then calculated the statistical enrichment of these sequence attributes for both structured (clusters 1\u20134) and unstructured (clusters 5\u20136) genes over background by random permutation analysis. We found that clusters 1\u20134 showed statistically significant enrichments for Reb1 and Rsc3 binding sites and AAAAA sequences, while closed promoters showed an enrichment of TATA binding sites, matching the predictions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Importantly, it is unstructured/closed and TATA-rich promoters that have been shown previously to mostly rely on chromatin modifiers and remodelers for their activation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Raser and O'Shea, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Musladin et al., 2014</a>). As developed in the \u2018Discussion\u2019, we believe our results, combined with others, argue for two different modes of impact of RSC and other remodelers at the two promoter types: open and closed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

These promoters have increased nucleosome movement and histone turnover (yellow arrows), likely aided by chromatin remodelers such as RSC and ISWI, which eject or reposition nucleosomes, respectively. In the absence of RSC, nucleosome ejection is reduced, leading to higher nucleosome density (opaque nucleosomes) and a reduction in transcription. Additional loss of ISW1a may reduce the assembly/organization of nucleosomes in the promoter, partially restoring transcription."

Here, we describe an antagonistic relationship between two such chromatin remodelers, RSC and ISW1, through a combination of genetics, gene expression, and genome-wide nucleosome positioning studies. At genes, RSC is primarily utilized for gene activation, providing this function, at least in part, by establishing or maintaining the NDR structure at promoters. We find that this function is partly counteracted by Isw1 activity, which re-positions nucleosomes to \u2018fill in\u2019 the NDR and positions nucleosomes over <i>cis</i> regulatory sequences. While there are other remodelers that also act at promoters, we consider the interactions described herein as the strongest evidence to date exemplifying chromatin remodeler antagonism."

The first screen utilized an SGA method to identify suppressors of <i>rsc7\u0394</i> and revealed <i>isw1\u0394</i> as the strongest of four identified gene suppressors and the only gene with a chromatin-related function. Indeed, combinations of <i>rsc</i> mutants with mutations in chromatin factors are almost invariably lethal (<i>rsc4</i>-HDAC combinations are a rare exception [<a href=\"#bib30\">Kasten et al., 2004</a>]). The second screen\u2014involving <i>rsc2</i> suppression by histone mutations\u2014yielded a small set of mild suppressors in histone H3 and one suppressor of moderate strength, H4 RH17,18CY. This region of the H4 tail is known as the \u2018basic patch\u2019\u2014an epitope of known importance for the binding and activity of several chromatin-modifying factors including ISWI, Sir3, and Dot1 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clapier et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Clapier et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Altaf et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fingerman et al., 2007</a>). Further genetic work focused the impact of this mutation on ISWI function, then on Isw1 function, and finally on Isw1a function (as opposed to the compositionally distinct Isw1b complex). Notably, combinations of <i>isw1\u0394</i> with Swi/Snf mutations did not confer suppression, indicating specificity for suppressing RSC function. Taken together, two independent genetic screens, combined with multiple additional genetic approaches, identify a specific suppression relationship between the RSC complex and the Isw1a complex."

It is possible that the <i>isw1</i>\u0394 and <i>ioc3</i>\u0394 suppression of <i>gcn5</i>\u0394 <i>sas3</i>\u0394 may be partially due to reducing the phenotypic effects of reduced acetylation by reducing RSC activity, since RSC function is partially dependent on acetylation (<a href=\"#bib62\">VanDemark et al., 2007</a>)."

                        "text": "We then explored whether this suppression relationship resulted from opposing roles of the two remodelers for regulating chromatin structure. A role for RSC at maintaining proper chromatin structure was previously demonstrated through the use of the strong <i>Sth1</i> degron allele (<a href=\"#bib44\">Parnell et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</a>) and other RSC alleles (<a href=\"#bib4\">Badis et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ganguli et al., 2014</a>). Loss of RSC function results in a gain of nucleosome density across Pol III genes and at the NDR of many Pol II genes. A clear observation here is the \u2018leftward\u2019 shift of the +1 and subsequent nucleosomes towards the NDR. This is consistent with (and extends) published models that RSC maintains the NDR by moving and/or ejecting nucleosomes from the TSS. Our work suggests that this movement and \u2018fill in\u2019 is, at least in part, performed by the ISWI family of remodelers, as we have demonstrated a reduction of the \u2018fill in\u2019 in the <i>rsc isw1</i> double mutant. Cells lacking <i>ISW1</i> alone exhibit modest changes in the coding region (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ni et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tirosh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yen et al., 2012</a>), which may, in part, be due to the loss of the ISW1b complex, which is thought to act primarily in the coding region, as opposed to the ISW1a complex that acts at promoters (<a href=\"#bib36\">Morillon et al., 2003</a>). Our work here provides the first molecular examination of <i>rsc isw1</i> double mutants (prompted by our genetic suppression relationships) demonstrating antagonism between these remodelers regarding the depth of the NDR, the occupancy and positioning of the +1 nucleosome, and the phasing of proximal nucleosomes in the coding region (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

More responsive genes have an open/structured promoter, with a classic \u22121, NDR, and +1 nucleosome at uniform positions with respect to the TSS. These patterns are evolutionarily conserved and partially imposed by sequence (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ioshikhes et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tsankov et al., 2011</a>), where the open promoters demonstrate a higher enrichment of nucleosome exclusion sequences, such as tracts of AAAAA, and illustrated by the strong NDR in the prediction model. While sequence alone cannot entirely dictate chromatin structure (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>), chromatin remodelers like RSC are able to reinforce the NDR by moving nucleosomes out of the NDR. The increased likelihood of Rsc3 or Reb1 binding sites occurring within the NDR may help recruit RSC or other factors to promoters that require nucleosome sliding or ejection activity to maintain this open architecture (<a href=\"#bib4\">Badis et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</a>). However, we note that the transcriptional output from these open promoters appears less affected following RSC loss than at closed/structured promoters (see below)."

This is not to say that these promoters have no chromatin structure at all; rather, each promoter has a unique chromatin structure that is not uniformly identical in phasing. In composite measurements, such as those presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, these promoters appear to have little chromatin structure, when, in reality, they simply lack consensus structure. These promoters have an increased likelihood to have a TATA box and other transcription factor binding sites, whose access may be regulated by the partial occlusion by nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ioshikhes et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tirosh and Barkai, 2008</a>). Here, Isw1a may function to help assemble/mature and properly space nucleosomes at these promoters to repress transcription, which then increases their reliance upon remodelers such as RSC and/or SWI/SNF to expose these binding sites for proper activation. Hence, these promoters would have an increased presence of both activating and repressing chromatin remodelers, as well as histone turnover, both of which we observe (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This continual state of flux, as well as lack of uniformity, may help explain why we observe little collective change in the chromatin structure in the absence of RSC function, while also observing a greater reliance on RSC function to maintain an active transcriptional status."

These results reveal the different strategies chromatin used by genes for maintaining and regulating genic transcription through the use of promoter architecture, DNA accessibility, and the antagonism between complexes that act on promoter chromatin."

By using a synthetic genetic array (SGA) approach to screen for suppressors of <i>rsc</i> mutants, the authors discovered that another remodeling protein, Isw1, specifically ameliorates the <i>rsc</i> mutant phenotypes. Nucleosome mapping studies revealed global effects of RSC and ISW1a complexes acting against each other in shaping the promoter chromatin architecture. This work appears to be a promising candidate for <i>eLife</i>. There are, however, a number of specific questions and concerns that need to be addressed."

For the few genes (e.g., MTH1, GOS1, SNF6, HIS4) that do show clear gene expression changes upon suppression by <i>ioc3\u0394</i> or <i>isw1\u0394,</i> the authors should also reveal the corresponding nucleosome maps so that readers can assess the relationship between nucleosome occupancy/position and transcription, and whether there is any correlation between the chromatin and transcription in this respect. Whatever the correlation, the issue should be articulated in the text, and possible explanations provided. Likewise it would be useful to know where the functionally affected genes fall in the categories of open and closed promoters. Do any rules emerge, or is it just random?"

Whatever the correlation, the issue should be articulated in the text, and possible explanations provided. Likewise it would be useful to know where the functionally affected genes fall in the categories of open and closed promoters. Do any rules emerge, or is it just random</i>?"

Ideally, one could link changes in nucleosome positioning to expression by using high-resolution data to show that a nucleosome has moved with respect to an important cis-controlling element, and then infer that the movement might underlie the expression change. However, our profiles are derived from a microarray platform, and although these arrays proved to be very reproducible and provide great \u2018class average\u2019 maps of gene/promoter cohorts, their resolution does not allow us to state with confidence that a single nucleosome underlies the expression change. This is indeed a limitation worth discussing, so we have added text in the Results section to reflect this limitation, and we have also included how these genes partition into the open and closed categories. This is one reason why we did not focus our paper on these single genes, but instead focused the work on our clear genetic and genomic (cohort average) evidence for antagonism between these two Remodeler families and how this interplay affects promoter/gene architecture at cohorts of genes. Future work by us and others will indeed address their interplay at particular genes."

The six clusters in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> actually involve different datasets, clustered separately, that just happened to both have six clusters. We thank the reviewers for noticing this, as we now see how a reader could have easily thought that these were the same datasets. In actuality, these two figure panels represent independent k-means cluster organizations of different data. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> represents the k-means cluster organization of the RSC and ISW1a occupancy based on the microarray data, and was provided entirely for illustrative purposes to simply show the similarity of RSC and ISW1a occupancy. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> displays instead the k-means clustering of the rsc null/RSC nucleosome ratio generated (and shown) in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, and thus bear no relationship to those derived in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. To reduce confusion, the cluster labels have been removed from <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; these labels and groups are never mentioned in the manuscript. Furthermore, we make this distinction clear in the text. Additionally, some references to cluster groups in the text now explicitly reference to those clusters derived in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, to help guide the reader."
