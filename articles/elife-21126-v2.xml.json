To understand how the underlying neural circuit turns the behavior on and off, we optically recorded circuit activity in behaving animals while manipulating circuit function using mutations, optogenetics, and drugs. In the active state, the circuit shows rhythmic activity phased with the body bends of locomotion. The serotonergic HSN command neurons initiate the active state, but accumulation of unlaid eggs also promotes the active state independent of the HSNs. The cholinergic VC motor neurons slow locomotion during egg-laying muscle contraction and egg release. The uv1 neuroendocrine cells mechanically sense passage of eggs through the vulva and release tyramine to inhibit egg laying, in part via the LGC-55 tyramine-gated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel on the HSNs. Our results identify discrete signals that entrain or detach the circuit from the locomotion central pattern generator to produce active and inactive states."

To understand how the underlying neural circuit turns the behavior on and off, we optically recorded circuit activity in behaving animals while manipulating circuit function using mutations, optogenetics, and drugs. In the active state, the circuit shows rhythmic activity phased with the body bends of locomotion. The serotonergic HSN command neurons initiate the active state, but accumulation of unlaid eggs also promotes the active state independent of the HSNs. The cholinergic VC motor neurons slow locomotion during egg-laying muscle contraction and egg release. The uv1 neuroendocrine cells mechanically sense passage of eggs through the vulva and release tyramine to inhibit egg laying, in part via the LGC-55 tyramine-gated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel on the HSNs. Our results identify discrete signals that entrain or detach the circuit from the locomotion central pattern generator to produce active and inactive states."

This quote neatly captures the challenge of working out how 80 billion neurons collectively generate our thoughts and behavior. Fortunately, the nervous system is also organized into simpler units called circuits. Each consists of a relatively small number of neurons, which communicate with one another to control as little as a single behavior. These circuits should in principle be simple enough for us to understand, particularly if we study them in nervous systems less complex than our own."

This circuit, diagrammed in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, consists of two serotonergic Hermaphrodite Specific Neurons (HSNs) and six cholinergic Ventral C neurons (VCs), each of which synapse onto a set of vulval muscles whose contraction expels eggs. Four neuroendocrine uv1 cells also regulate egg laying (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jose et al., 2007</a>). Despite its anatomical simplicity, the egg-laying circuit produces a regulated, rhythmic behavior that alternates between quiescent periods of about 20 min during which no egg laying occurs, and active states lasting a few minutes during which\u00a0~5 eggs are laid (<a href=\"#bib52\">Waggoner et al., 1998</a>). Active states appear to result when the HSNs release serotonin that signals through G protein coupled receptors on the vulval muscles to increase their excitability (<a href=\"#bib52\">Waggoner et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shyn et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hapiak et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Emtage et al., 2012</a>). Strong regulation by sensory stimuli is superimposed on the pattern of alternating behavioral states. For example, carbon dioxide regulates neuropeptide release from head sensory neurons that signal through receptors on the HSNs to inhibit egg laying (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hallem et al., 2011</a>). Worms also halt egg laying in the absence of food and restart the behavior when re-fed (<a href=\"#bib10\">Daniels et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dong et al., 2000</a>)."

Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in cells in the circuit was initially optically recorded in immobilized animals, which have limited ability to engage in egg-laying behavior (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shyn et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). More recently we developed methods to optically record Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of the vulval muscles in moving animals as they engage in normal egg-laying behavior. Using ratiometric imaging to correct for movement and focus artifacts, and recording at 20 frames/sec for periods of up to one hour, we were able to measure activity of the vulval muscles as animals cycled through active and inactive states (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins and Koelle, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Our recordings showed that the vulval muscles are excited rhythmically in phase with the body bends of animal locomotion, and we proposed this was due to signaling from the cholinergic motor neurons, including the VCs, that are rhythmically active during locomotion. We found that a conserved ERG K<sup>+</sup> channel depresses response of the vulval muscles to excitation, thus maintaining the inactive behavior state, and we proposed that serotonin signaling onto vulval muscle receptors enhances vulval muscle excitability to allow the strong muscle contractions and egg release seen in the active state. We have now generated tools to carry out Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings in moving animals for each neuron type in the egg-laying circuit. Combining these recordings with precise manipulations of the circuit using mutations, optogenetics, and drugs allows us to deduce how specific signals from these cells drive specific features of circuit activity and behavior."

We previously observed that vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients tend to occur when the vulva is at a particular phase of the locomotion body bend (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins and Koelle, 2013</a>), suggesting rhythmic activity in the locomotor circuit may be the source of rhythmicity in the egg-laying circuit. Using our video recordings of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in moving animals, we examined whether HSN and VC activity, like vulval muscle activity, are phased with locomotion. Thus we determined timing of the peaks of HSN, VC, and vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients relative to when the vulva passed through the previous and subsequent most contracted or relaxed state of a body bend (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, see Materials and Methods). The results were plotted on histograms with ventral contraction at 0 and 360\u00b0, ventral relaxation at 180\u00b0, and intermediate phases of body bends at the angles in between (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013I</a>). We found that the HSN, VC, and vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients occurred when the vulva was at particular phases of the locomotor body bend. HSN transients just prior to egg release reached their maximum at\u00a0~180\u00b0, when the vulva and adjacent body wall muscles were at their most relaxed state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). VC and vulval muscle transients that accompanied egg laying occurred later, starting at\u00a0~225\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H and I</a>). HSN transients that did not result in egg laying showed no clear evidence of phasing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). In contrast, VC transients and vulval muscle twitch transients that did not lead to egg release were still phased, but delayed by\u00a0~45\u00b0 toward the most ventral contracted state. These results confirm our previous observations that vulval muscle twitching and egg-laying activity are phased with locomotion (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins and Koelle, 2013</a>). These results extend that analysis to show that HSN, VC, and vulval muscle activity during egg laying events are rhythmic, phased with locomotion, and occur earlier in the body bend cycle, when the adjacent body wall muscles are in a more relaxed state."

(2012)</a> that optogenetic activation of HSNs stimulates egg-laying behavior (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), but we activated the HSNs while simultaneously recording behavior and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the VCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) or vulval muscles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We found that activation of HSNs resulted in circuit activity reminiscent of a spontaneous active state, including rhythmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of both VCs and vulval muscles, and egg-laying events that accompanied a subset of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Some differences from a spontaneous active state were notable. Almost every VC transient after optogenetic HSN activation was accompanied by an egg-laying event, whereas only one third of VC transients during spontaneous active states were accompanied by egg-laying events. These results suggest that the high level of HSN activity after optogenetic activation induces strong coupling of VC and vulval muscle excitation."

Careful observation shows that the most dramatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes during vulval muscle twitching occur at the ventral tips of the vm1 muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The VCs innervate vm2 muscles but not the vm1 muscles. The vm1 muscles are instead innervated by the VB6 and VA7 neurons that also release acetylcholine to drive body wall muscle contraction for locomotion (<a href=\"#bib56\">White et al., 1986</a>). Consistent with this, vm1 twitching occurs at the same time the adjacent ventral body wall muscles are contracting during locomotion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Increased electrical excitability of the vulval muscles during a spontaneous or optogenetically-induced active state may allow for vm1 excitation by VB6/VA7 with each body bend."

While VC4 and VC5 make extensive synapses onto the vm2 muscles, VC1-3 and VC6 make extensive, distributed synapses onto the ventral body wall muscles (<a href=\"#bib55\">White et al., 1976</a>). How VC activity during egg laying might affect body wall muscle contraction has not been examined. We optogenetically activated the HSNs to induce active states and recorded animal speed around egg-laying events (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We found a clear and significant reduction of locomotion speed beginning\u00a0~1 s before egg release, a time when VC activity is increasing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>).

The shortening phenotype seen in VC ChR2 animals after blue light exposure closely resembles that seen for optogenetic activation of the body wall muscles (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nagel et al., 2005</a>), except the head and tail of VC-activated animals were still mobile and active, consistent with the fact that VC neurons innervate only the central body wall muscles (<a href=\"#bib55\">White et al., 1976</a>). Our results indicate that while VC activity immediately precedes egg-laying events, it is not sufficient to drive egg release. Optogenetic VC activation is sufficient to produce a slowing of locomotion as seen during egg-laying events. In contrast, HSN activity is sufficient to induce all of the hallmarks of the active state, including rhythmic vulval muscle twitching, VC transients, and the coordinated vulval muscle contractions that produce egg-laying events."

Animals lacking HSNs have a substantial lengthening of the inactive state (<a href=\"#bib52\">Waggoner et al., 1998</a>) and are strongly egg-laying defective, accumulating\u00a0~50 eggs in the uterus rather than the 12\u201315 seen in the wild type (<a href=\"#bib50\">Trent et al., 1983</a>). We expected to find that loss of HSNs led to a dramatic reduction in vulval muscle activity. Surprisingly, we found the opposite; animals lacking HSNs had more frequent vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during the inactive state and robust activity during infrequent active states that led to multiple eggs being laid in a short period (compare <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>; quantitation in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). There was a significant reduction in the amplitude of vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during egg laying in <i>egl-1(dm)</i> mutants while the amplitude of twitch Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Vulval muscle activity in <i>egl-1(dm)</i> mutants lacking HSNs resembled the frequent yet uncoordinated vulval muscle activity found in animals missing the vm2 vulval muscle arms onto which the HSNs normally make synapses (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Such activity involves asynchronous contraction of the anterior and posterior vulval muscles, which is ineffective at allowing egg release. One quantitative measure of this asynchrony is that overall vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peaks in <i>egl-1(dm)</i> mutants were longer in duration, likely resulting in individual muscle cells beginning their transients at different times (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in animals lacking HSNs remained phased with locomotion, including the\u00a0~45\u00b0 advance in phase of vulval muscle activity that results in egg-laying events (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that the HSNs are necessary to coordinate contraction of anterior and posterior vulval muscles, and that signals from other cells besides the HSNs can also induce the egg-laying active state."

To test if egg accumulation contributed to the onset of the active phase, we sterilized animals with FUDR (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mitchell et al., 1979</a>), a DNA synthesis inhibitor that blocks germ line cell division and thus egg production. FUDR-treated animals had a dramatic reduction of vulval muscle activity and appeared to be stuck in the inactive state, with no egg-laying transients observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). The inhibition of vulval muscle activity by FUDR occurred in both wild-type animals and HSN-deficient <i>egl-1(dm)</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and D</a>).

The four uv1 cells sit at the junction between the uterine lumen and the vulval canal (<a href=\"#bib39\">Newman and Sternberg, 1996</a>), and as such are positioned to mechanically sense the accumulation of unlaid eggs in the uterus and/or passage of eggs through the vulval canal as they are laid. To record uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, we co-expressed GCaMP5 and mCherry in uv1 from the <i>ocr-2</i> promoter and made recordings in behaving animals. We found that the uv1 cells were mechanically deformed as each egg passed through the vulva, and then showed strong Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients after egg release (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Egg-laying events did not always trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in uv1, with uv1-silent events usually being the first or last within an active state (data not shown). We also observed weaker uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients a few minutes before or after the egg-laying active state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). Because these were not closely associated with egg-laying events their functional importance remains unclear. Typical active state uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients began immediately with or slightly before egg release, coinciding with the initial mechanical deformation of uv1 caused by the egg, with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peak occurring\u00a0~2 s later (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Based on the position of the uv1 cells, their morphological deformations during passage of eggs, and the timing of uv1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, our data suggest the uv1 cells are mechanically activated by eggs passing through the vulva during egg laying."

We found that exogenous tyramine reduced egg laying in wild-type animals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To identify targets of tyramine inhibition, we tested response to exogenous tyramine in strains mutant for three known <i>C. elegans</i> tyramine receptors. Animals lacking <i>lgc-55</i>, which encodes a tyramine-gated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, showed resistance to inhibition by exogenous tyramine (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), although tyramine at high levels still had a residual ability to reduce egg laying in <i>lgc-55</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We transformed into <i>C. elegans</i> a fosmid transgene containing the full-length <i>lgc-55</i> gene fused to GFP coding sequences, and found LGC-55 is expressed in the HSNs, uv1, and vulval muscles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#bib41\">Pirri et al., 2009</a>). Re-expression of LGC-55 specifically in HSN from the <i>tph-1</i> promoter restored tyramine sensitivity to <i>lgc-55</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). We have previously shown that two Cl<sup>-</sup> extruding transporters, KCC-2 and ABTS-1, are expressed in the HSNs where they promote the development of inhibitory ligand-gated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel signaling (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tanis et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bellemer et al., 2011</a>). These data suggest that tyramine signaling through LGC-55 would hyperpolarize the HSN and inhibit activity. To test this directly, we compared HSN activity in wild-type and <i>lgc-55</i> mutant animals. We observed a significant increase in the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in HSNs of <i>lgc-55</i> mutant animals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E and F</a>) in both the inactive and active states of egg-laying behavior. Mean HSN inter-transient intervals in wild-type animals were 41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 s in the inactive state and 17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 s during the active state, while intervals in <i>lgc-55</i> mutants were reduced to 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 s in the inactive state and 13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 s during the active state. Thus, the absence of inhibitory feedback by tyramine signaling onto the HSNs leads to increased activity in both the active and inactive egg-laying behavior states."

Using recordings of cell activity in behaving animals as they transition from the inactive to active egg-laying states, we were able to show that circuit activity is diminished during the inactive state, strongly increased and rhythmic during the active state, and this rhythm is phased with sinusoidal locomotion. Sterilization eliminated the active state rhythm, locking animals in the inactive state. Our results suggest that activity in the egg-laying circuit, like that of many other modulated motor circuits, responds to rhythmic input from central pattern generators (<a href=\"#bib32\">Marder et al., 2015</a>)."

Active state vulval muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients peak rhythmically each time the vulva approaches a ventral body bend, the point at which the cholinergic VB and VA motor neurons release acetylcholine to rhythmically excite both the vm1 muscles and adjacent ventral body wall muscles during locomotion. During the inactive state, K<sup>+</sup> channels including ERG depress vulval muscle excitability below threshold, explaining why we fail to observe vulval muscle activity with each body bend during this state (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins and Koelle, 2013</a>). While we observe rhythmic activity in the HSNs in the active phase, the periodicity and phasing of HSN activity does not correlate with that of locomotion. Consistent with this, previous work found changes in osmolarity can drive rhythmic HSN activity even in immobilized animals (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Thus HSN rhythmic activity is independent of locomotion, although we found HSN Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that happen to fall at a specific phase of locomotor body bends are more likely to be followed by egg release. We propose that release of serotonin from the HSNs, along with an unknown signal resulting from mechanical stretch of the uterus by accumulating eggs, together raise vulval muscle electrical excitability to result in the active state during which the vulval muscles undergo rhythmic twitching or egg laying contractions in response to the same cholinergic VA and VB neurons that drive locomotor body bends. This model accounts for the phasing of vm1 transients with body bends, although egg-laying events require additional activity in the vm2 muscles that results in the coordinated contraction of all vm muscles that results in egg release. We found that vm transients that lead to egg release are on average slightly phase advanced relative to those that do not. This phase advance could from the excitatory input onto the vm2 muscles occurring earlier in the body bend, and candidates for this input are the HSNs and VCs, both of which synapse onto the vm2 muscles and have phased activity during egg-laying events. The functional purpose of this phase advance may be mechanical. Passage of each 25\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040 \u00b5m egg requires contraction of vm1 and vm2 muscles on both the anterior and posterior sides of the vulva (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2013</a>). There may not be sufficient room for vulva to fully open and release egg unless the adjacent body wall muscles are in a contracted state."

Optogenetic activation of HSNs recapitulates features of the active state including phased VC and vulval muscle activity and multiple egg-laying events. However, stimulation of the HSNs fails to drive tetanic contraction of the vulval muscles as would be predicted for a motor neuron releasing a fast-acting neurotransmitter. Instead, HSN makes and releases the neuromodulator serotonin which signals through G protein coupled serotonin receptors to activate the vulval muscles (<a href=\"#bib11\">Desai et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shyn et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Carnell et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hobson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hapiak et al., 2009</a>). The HSNs also release serotonin onto the AVF interneurons in the nerve ring to promote a state of locomotion arousal that accompanies the active state (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hardaker et al., 2001</a>). Animals defective in serotonin signaling have reduced egg laying (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tanis et al., 2008</a>), but this defect is not as severe as that of <i>egl-1(dm)</i> animals missing HSNs (<a href=\"#bib50\">Trent et al., 1983</a>), suggesting HSN releases additional neurotransmitters. We found that optogenetic activation of HSNs leads to rhythmic activity of VC neurons, which are not known to express serotonin receptors, so an unknown signal derived from HSN could directly activate VCs, as depicted in the <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> model."

The HSNs receive little synaptic input near the vulval except from the PLM mechanosensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib56\">White et al., 1986</a>). The PLMs inhibit HSN activity and egg laying in response to gentle touch (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>), but recent work indicates the PLM neurons are also deformed during normal patterns of locomotion that could contribute to rhythmic activity seen in HSN during egg laying (<a href=\"#bib49\">Topalidou et al., 2012</a>). Neuroendocrine signaling also regulates HSN activity. <i>flp-10</i> and <i>flp-17</i> neuropeptides are released from the CO<sub>2</sub>-responsive BAG neurons in the head, and these neuropeptides signal through EGL-6 receptor and G\u03b1<sub>o</sub> to activate IRK channels that inhibit HSN activity and egg laying (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hallem et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Emtage et al., 2012</a>). Because loss of EGL-6 or IRK channels do not increase egg laying as much as cell-specific inhibition of G\u03b1<sub>o</sub>, there must be additional receptors and effectors of G\u03b1<sub>o</sub> that inhibit HSN activity. G\u03b1<sub>q</sub> signaling opposes G\u03b1<sub>o</sub> to increase serotonin release from the HSNs (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tanis et al., 2008</a>), but the ligands and receptors that activate G\u03b1<sub>q</sub> have not yet been identified. Because we find that HSN Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients vary more in frequency than amplitude, we propose that these diverse sensory signals increase or reduce the probability that HSN reaches a threshold potential that can initiate, sustain, or terminate HSN activity and thus the active behavior state of the egg-laying circuit."

Mutants lacking HSNs are strongly egg-laying defective, but eventually enter active states with properly phased vulval muscle twitching and egg-laying transients. The active state was eliminated in animals sterilized by FUDR, reducing vulval muscle activity and phasing to that seen in the inactive state. Recent work has identified the gonad as an important site of regulation for adult-specific behaviors in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fujiwara et al., 2016</a>). We propose that the accumulation of unlaid eggs in the uterus, perhaps leading to mechanical stretch, provides an essential, permissive signal for entry into the active state. Several steps during embryo production and maturation could regulate entry into the active state to result in the\u00a0~20 min\u00a0period of the egg-laying inactive state\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib52\">Waggoner et al., 1998</a>). Animals grown on food generate one new oocyte from each of two gonad arms every\u00a0~10 min, balancing out the 3\u20135 eggs laid in the\u00a0~2 min active state that occurs every\u00a0~20 min, to result in a ~constant number of unlaid eggs in the uterus (<a href=\"#bib34\">McCarter et al., 1999</a>). New embryos are moved by gonadal sheath contractions into the spermatheca for fertilization and deposition into the uterus. Excitable cells drive each of these steps, providing potential sources of regulation by cell signaling and sensory feedback (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kariya et al., 2004</a>). Eight uterine muscles line the uterine lumen and form gap junctions with the vm2 muscles (<a href=\"#bib56\">White et al., 1986</a>), and the addition of unlaid eggs into the uterus could induce a mechanical stretch that cross-excites the vm2 muscles. Future work will be required to understand how the accumulation of unlaid eggs promotes the active state."

However, we found little correlation between the strength of the VC activity and whether an egg is laid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>), and that optogenetic activation of the VC neurons fails to drive egg laying. Further, VC-defective and acetylcholine-deficient mutants have <i>increased</i> egg-laying behavior (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bany et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ringstad and Horvitz, 2008</a>). These data together are consistent with a model in which acetylcholine released from the VA/VB motor neurons signal through nicotinic receptors on the vm1 muscles to stimulate rhythmic vulval muscle twitching, which combined with acetylcholine released from the VC neurons to similarly excite the vm2 muscles results in egg laying. High levels of VC activity, such as occurs during optogenetic activation, may drive release of additional signals, such as neuropeptides, that inhibit egg-laying circuit activity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bany et al., 2003</a>; Banerjee and Francis, personal communication), or by freezing locomotion may feedback to halt the VA/VB activity required to drive vm1 contraction."

As noted above, optogenetic activation of HSNs results in VC activity, suggesting a currently unknown signal from HSN directly activates VCs. A second possible input onto VCs is suggested by the fact that the VC neurons extend processes devoid of synapses dorsally along the vulval hypodermis that could be mechanosensory (<a href=\"#bib56\">White et al., 1986</a>). Thus, rhythmic VC activity could be stimulated mechanically by body bends or by a humoral signal released from the locomotor circuit (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hu et al., 2011</a>). Further, VC activity could be mechanically stimulated by vulval muscle contraction (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>), particularly as we observed mechanical deformation of VC presynaptic termini during strong twitching and egg-laying contractions. In this way, the VCs could act like baroreceptors\u2013mechanically activated by vulval muscle contraction to drive contraction of the body wall muscles that results in animal slowing until the feedback of egg release. In this model, the coordination of locomotion and egg laying by tying both behaviors to the same central pattern generator allows productive egg release."

Passage of eggs through the vulva mechanically deforms the uv1 cells and triggers a strong Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. Our results suggest this activates uv1 to release tyramine that inhibits egg-laying, at least in part via the LGC-55 receptor on the HSN neurons. Active states last\u00a0~2 min, and inhibitory tyramine release from uv1 could provide a feedback signal that terminates activity in the circuit. The four uv1 cells have a unique structural position in the vulva that may explain how they become activated during egg laying (<a href=\"#bib40\">Newman et al., 1996</a>). uv1 cells extend processes that contact and make adherens junctions with the ventral vulF vulval cells. uv1 cells also makes dorsal attachments to utse, a large, H-shaped multinucleate uterine seam cell that attaches the uterus to the lateral epidermis and that functions as a hymen broken by the first egg-laying event. The acute mechanical strain on vulF, uv1, and/or utse during egg passage could mechanically activate ion channels. Previous work has shown uv1 expresses several TRPV channels that may be mechanosensory and contribute to this response (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jose et al., 2007</a>). A dominant-negative OCR-2 mutant expressed in uv1 leads to hyperactive egg-laying behavior phenotype. We still observe Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in uv1 after egg-laying events in this <i>ocr-2(vs29)</i> mutant (data not shown), suggesting other channels contribute to the uv1 activity we see after egg laying. Although our results indicate that uv1 releases tyramine to inhibit the HSNs via LGC-55, this signaling event does not fully explain the ability of uv1 cells to inhibit the egg-laying circuit. We found that inhibition of egg laying by exogenous tyramine is reduced but not eliminated in <i>lgc-55</i> null mutants, suggesting other tyramine receptors help terminate the active state. The uv1 cells also make <i>nlp-7</i> and <i>flp-11</i>, two neuropeptides that inhibit HSN activity and egg-laying behavior (Banerjee and Francis, personal communication), and the identification of the receptors and signaling pathways through which they inhibit serotonin release will help to more fully understand how activity of the egg-laying circuit is terminated."

A great challenge is to reduce these abstract concepts to concrete, specific mechanisms in the case of a real circuit. For the <i>C. elegans</i> egg-laying circuit, signals in each of the categories outlined above are now identified, albeit in varying levels of detail and completeness. Continuing analysis of the <i>C. elegans</i> egg-laying circuit using recordings of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in behaving animals, combined with genetic, optogenetic, and pharmacological manipulation, provides a path towards detailed understanding the mechanisms that control activity of this model circuit."

The stage and focus were adjusted manually to keep the egg-laying system in view during recording periods. Long-term recordings were cropped to 10\u201330 min with the first egg-laying event at 5 min. Three different imaging systems were used to collect recordings, and each gave quantitatively similar results. First, single, two-channel confocal slices (18 \u00b5m thick) of GCaMP5 and mCherry fluorescence were collected through a 20x Plan Apochromat objective (0.8NA) using a Zeiss Axio Observer microscope and recorded at 20 fps at 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256 pixel resolution, 16-bit depth using a 710 Duo LIVE scanner as described previously (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins and Koelle, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2013</a>).

GCaMP5/mCherry ratios were calculated, and pixels with mCherry fluorescence intensities\u00a0~2 standard deviations above background were selected as objects for mean ratio measurement. While the Volocity algorithm set with these parameters typically identified the vulval muscles and uv1 cells as a single object, the complex morphology of the HSN and VC neurons often led to the cells being found as two or more objects within each video frame. These were rejoined using a custom script in MATLAB (Mathworks). The ratio of the joined object was scaled in proportion to the area of each component object to generate an area-adjusted GCaMP5/mCherry ratio. The ratio data were then smoothed using a 150 msec (three timepoint) rolling average, and the lowest 10% of the GCaMP5/mCherry ratio values over the entire recording period were averaged to establish a \u2206R/R baseline. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and their features (peak amplitude and width at half-maximum) were identified from ratio traces using the <i>findpeaks</i> algorithm in MATLAB, and peaks were confirmed by visual inspection of GCaMP5/mCherry recordings and ratio traces. Egg-laying events were observed by allowing a small amount of bright field light to transmit into the mCherry channel whose gain was increased for egg visualization. The egg-laying active state was defined in recordings to include those transients that occurred one minute before and one minute after each egg-laying event. Those transients not found within an active state were considered to be in the inactive state. Inter-transient intervals were calculated by measuring the elapsed time between successive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peaks during the inactive and active state. Because some inactive states were devoid of detectable activity (e.g. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, VC Ca<sup>2+</sup>), inter-transient intervals during such periods were operationally defined as the time before the first or after the last transient in the recording. Because the recordings were cropped to focus on the egg-laying active state, the inactive state inter-transient intervals reported here should be considered a lower estimate. To facilitate comparisons of \u2206R/R between different reporters and recording conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1H</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5D</a>), the maximum peak amplitude was normalized to 1. Spectral analysis of active phase Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces was performed by Fast Fourier Transform method of estimation using the Signal Analyzer app in the MATLAB Signal Processing toolbox (R2016b). Quantitatively similar results were obtained using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram function and using auto-correlation analysis (data not shown). The largest amplitude frequency peak between 0 and 250 mHz from each active state periodogram was compared using one-way ANOVA."

We recorded the timing of each ventral contraction and/or relaxation flanking each Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peak. To approximate the phasing of that Ca<sup>2+</sup> relative to locomotion, we operationally defined 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0 as when the vulva was positioned when the adjacent body wall muscles were at their most ventrally contracted state, and we defined 180\u00b0 when the vulva was positioned when the adjacent body wall muscles were at their most relaxed state. The relative timing of each Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peak or behavior event was calculated as fraction of time elapsed between the previous and subsequent contraction or relaxation, regardless of whether the animal was engaged in forward or reverse locomotion, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib9\">Collins and Koelle, 2013</a>). For example, if a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peaked exactly 2 s after the vulva passed through its most ventrally relaxed state (180\u00b0) and 2 s prior to the ventral contracted state (360\u00b0), the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient phasing would be halfway between 180\u00b0 and 360\u00b0, or 270\u00b0. If a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peaked halfway between ventral contraction (0\u00b0) and ventral relaxation (180\u00b0), the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient phasing of that peak would be 90\u00b0. This method of estimation allows for phasing information to be extracted and compared independent of differences in individual animal speed and locomotion direction."

ATR was prepared at 100 mM in 100% ethanol and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. To prepare NGM plates for behavior analysis, ATR was diluted to 0.4 mM with warmed cultures of OP50 bacteria in B Broth, and 200 \u00b5l of culture was seeded onto each 60 mm NGM plate. The plates were allowed to grow for 24 hr at 25\u201337\u00b0C, after which late L4 worms were staged onto prepared plates for behavioral assays 24 hr later. During Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, ChR2 was activated with the same light used for GCaMP5 excitation. For timed behavior recording experiments on plates, a OTPG_4 TTL Pulse Generator (Doric Optics) was used to trigger image capture (Grasshopper 3, 4.1 Megapixel, USB3 CMOS camera, Point Grey Research) and shutter opening on a EL6000 metal halide light source generating 8\u201316 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> (depending on the magnification used) of\u00a0~470\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020 nm blue light via a EGFP filter set mounted on a Leica M165FC stereomicroscope. Worm size, speed, and body bends were determined from image sequences using Volocity."

Egg-laying is one of the best-described <i>C. elegans</i> behaviors, but the mechanistic details of how specific neurons and muscles control egg-laying have not been well-understood. The authors use optical imaging of neural and muscle cell activity in behaving worms to define the roles of specific motor neurons and accessory cells in generating egg-laying events. In particular they do a nice job relating their imaging data to previous work on the behavioral timing of egg-laying. The experiments are well-controlled and thorough, and justify the authors' conclusions. I am supportive of publication more or less as is."

Although the traces seem like the activity could be rhythmic (i.e. events separated by more or less periodic intervals) they do not provide evidence for this. This is particularly relevant since some earlier behavioral work has described egg-laying events within the active phase as stochastic rather than periodic. It should be straightforward to see if the intervals between neuronal spikes have a regular period or alternatively follow some sort of random distribution; either outcome would be interesting."

The theoretical foundations for how egg-laying behavior might be executed and regulated have been proposed in many earlier reports; however, this report uses G-CaMP-mediated real time calcium imaging of unrestrained behaving hermaphrodites to validate or re-qualify these ideas, and to generate more precise temporal measurements of activities between the HSN neurons, the VC neurons, the vulva muscles and the UV1 uterine endocrine cells."

The authors brought up this possibility in their 2013 J. Neuroscience paper, but in this study they measured several additional parameters to demonstrate that egg deposition has a higher probability of occurring when the ventral body wall muscles transitions between a relaxed and contracted state. Here they correlated the angles of worm postures with calcium transients of the HSN, VC neurons and vulva muscles with egg-laying events. What was surprising was the broad activity profiles of these excitable cells, but that only when the worm was in a specific posture (during locomotion), these cells activities correlated to an egg-laying event."

The authors followed up these interactions by perturbing other components of the egg-laying system."

The authors here revisited some of these conditions using cell-targeted CH2R-activation, the <i>egl-1(n986dm)</i> allele and exploring tyramine signaling, to report a more detailed picture of the temporal activities of the HSN VC and vulva muscle changes relative to the locomotor and fertility state of the hermaphrodite. The work presented in these sections summarizes and clarifies some of the hypothesis made in earlier reports."

I do not believe that there are any radical ideas or discoveries made in this report, but the report is a solid careful analysis of a complicated behavior. I also believe that the authors are deeply excited about understanding egg-laying behavior and very few other groups would put in the attention and detail to further our understanding of the problem. The approach of correlating HSN, VC UV1 and vulva muscle calcium activities with locomotion and egg-laying events is sound and validates hypotheses made in earlier reports by the authors and other in the field. The Discussion is well-written and summarizes the results, as-well-as raises a more mature way of thinking about how egg-laying behavior is executed in the hermaphrodite."

Although the traces seem like the activity could be rhythmic (i.e. events separated by more or less periodic intervals) they do not provide evidence for this. This is particularly relevant since some earlier behavioral work has described egg-laying events within the active phase as stochastic rather than periodic. It should be straightforward to see if the intervals between neuronal spikes have a regular period or alternatively follow some sort of random distribution; either outcome would be interesting.</i>"
