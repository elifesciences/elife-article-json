Fusion nonetheless proceeds efficiently. Ivanovic and Harrison suggest that these inactive hemagglutinins provide an evolutionary backup store. For example, the proportion of hemagglutinins on a virus particle that insert into the cell membrane affects how fast fusion occurs and how sensitive the virus is to attack by host immune-system proteins called antibodies. Therefore, an ability to control how often hemagglutinins insert into the membrane could allow the virus to adapt to host immune responses. In the future, Ivanovic and Harrison\u2019s findings could aid the discovery of drugs that inhibit the entry of influenza into human cells."

When the pH drops below a critical threshold, individual HAs within the contact zone adopt an \u2018extended state\u2019, in which the fusion peptide at the N-terminus of HA<sub>2</sub> engages the target membrane, while the C-terminal transmembrane anchor remains embedded in the viral membrane. Note that the \u2018extended state\u2019 might represent an ensemble of folded-back conformations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The probability of this stochastic event increases with proton concentration over the range at which groups on the protein titrate. A single HA trimer in the extended conformation cannot then fold back to its most stable, postfusion conformation, because of elastic resistance from the two membranes. Only when several neighboring HAs have extended and engaged can their joint action pull the two membranes together (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). When the critical number of extended neighbors is present, foldback is cooperative and progression toward fusion is fast."

When the total free energy is enough to overcome the \u2018hydration-force\u2019 barrier to merger (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rand and Parsegian, 1984</a>), fusion can ensue. We called this a \u2018tug-of-war\u2019 mechanism\u2014(N-1) trimers are not enough, but adding one more immediately precipitates a change, just as adding a critical extra team member will promptly snap a rope pulled against a fixed force. The team members need not touch each other as long as all are pulling on the same rope. An alternative model for cooperative action of fusion proteins comes from structural observations on alphavirus membrane fusion proteins, which suggest that a ring of five envelope-protein trimers might work as a single-unit fusion assembly (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gibbons et al., 2004</a>). This picture is a particular instance of mechanisms that require a defined, lateral interaction between participating proteins."

This analysis yields new conclusions concerning the course of viral fusion.

The simulations showed that the yield of hemifusion is relatively insensitive to the presence of inactive HAs for N<sub>h</sub> between 3 and 6 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). For N<sub>h</sub>\u00a0=\u00a03, more than 70% (<i>f</i><sub>np\u00a0</sub>=\u00a00.7) of the sites on a virion surface must be unproductive or inactive in order to detect any reduction in fusion yield; for N<sub>h\u00a0</sub>=\u00a06, we saw reduced yield whenever more than 50% of the sites lacked the potential to participate. The simulations also yielded relatively large increases in mean lag time to hemifusion for the tested range of <i>f</i><sub>np</sub> values (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). For N<sub>h\u00a0</sub>=\u00a03, we found a tenfold, and for N<sub>h\u00a0</sub>=\u00a06, a fivefold increase in mean time to hemifusion. In contrast to our simulation results, <a href=\"#bib27\">Otterstrom et al. (2014)</a> observed sudden decreases in hemifusion yield for even the small numbers of bound antibodies or Fabs, and at most about a two-to-threefold increase in hemifusion lag times until complete inhibition of hemifusion. This difference could not be explained by a smaller patch size (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and suggested to us that even for virions with no bound antibodies, a significant portion of surface sites lacked the potential to participate in fusion (i.e. the experiment was sampling from the right-hand portion of an entire theoretical inhibition curve). This qualitative conclusion is independent of the actual value of N<sub>h</sub> or <i>f</i><sub>np</sub>."

As <i>f</i><sub>np</sub> increased, a phase of relatively shallow dependence of the lag time gave way to a much stronger rate of increase, at about the same fraction at which the overall yield of hemifusion began to decline (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>). For <i>f</i><sub>np</sub> values at which more than half of the simulated virions no longer yielded hemifusion, the lag time dependence reached a plateau. <a href=\"#bib27\">Otterstrom et al.

Plateau occurs when additional reduction in the fraction of participating HAs is more likely to result in complete inhibition of hemifusion rather than further increase in the lag time. Indeed, for Fab concentrations in the plateau region for hemifusion delay, <a href=\"#bib27\">Otterstrom et al. (2014)</a> found a continuing decrease in hemifusion yield as Fab concentrations increased. The result is intuitively reasonable. A high fraction of non-participating sites in a contact patch corresponds to a high probability that any particular HA will fail to engage the target membrane, either because it cannot change conformation (unprocessed HA<sub>0</sub> or inhibitor bound HA<sub>1</sub>:HA<sub>2</sub>) or because it has irreversibly inactivated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). When this probability becomes high enough, it becomes almost impossible to achieve N<sub>h</sub> membrane-engaged neighbors within a contact patch of fixed size (consider, for example, the number of ways one can fit N<sub>h\u00a0</sub>=\u00a06 active HA neighbors within the contact patches illustrated in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> for different <i>f</i><sub>np</sub> values)."

They determined that for H3N2 X31 virions, an average of 261 bound Fabs gave half-maximal hemifusion inhibition and that 493 Fabs inhibited hemifusion completely. (We consider only their Fab data here, to avoid potential complications from divalent binding of IgGs.) We simulated inhibition, taking 375 as the number of HAs per virion (1125 Fab sites) (see Materials and methods) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We assumed random HA occupancy and postulated that a single bound Fab prevents the fusion transition of a trimer. We varied <i>f</i><sub>un</sub> values and looked for fractions that gave 50% hemifusion-yield inhibition for 261 bound Fabs and near complete inhibition for 493 bound Fabs. For N<sub>h\u00a0</sub>=\u00a03 and N<sub>h\u00a0</sub>=\u00a04, we obtained essentially unique answers for <i>f</i><sub>un</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and C</a>): 0.65 with N<sub>h\u00a0</sub>=\u00a03, and 0.4 with N<sub>h\u00a0</sub>=\u00a04. With N<sub>h\u00a0</sub>=\u00a05, no condition was consistent with the measured values (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This treatment of the inhibition data has thus allowed us to determine possible pairs of values for the number of neighboring HAs required for hemifusion and the fraction of unproductive HAs. For somewhat reduced <i>f</i><sub>un</sub> values, the data are also consistent with a smaller patch size (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This result makes intuitive sense because conceptually, a smaller patch size is like a larger patch size with more non-participating sites."

Moreover, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> shows that to fit the observed data, all virions must have the potential to fuse (that is, the simulated yield of hemifusion in the absence of Fabs is 100%, when the simulations are run with the parameters that best fit all the observations). The yield of hemifusion for H3N2 X31\u00a0virions reported by <a href=\"#bib27\">Otterstrom et al.

This difference suggests either that PR8 viruses require more HAs for hemifusion or that non-productive conformational changes are more likely (or both). (Virion size was the same for the H3 and H1 strains, so patch-size difference is not the reason for their differential neutralization susceptibility.) Following the same procedure as above for H3 HA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), we could find, for each value of N<sub>h</sub> between 3 and 6, a single value for <i>f</i><sub>un</sub> that gave both 50% fusion-yield inhibition for 74 bound Fabs and near-complete inhibition for 248 bound Fabs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

We adjusted the values for <i>k</i><sub>sim</sub> so that the mean hemifusion delay time in the absence of bound Fab was about 46 sec, as determined by <a href=\"#bib27\">Otterstrom et al. (2014)</a>. For either patch size, the corresponding <i>k</i><sub>sim</sub> ranged from 0.029\u20130.037 sec<sup>-1</sup> for N<sub>h</sub> from 3\u20136. The simulated yield of hemifusion for no bound Fab varied from about 65\u201370% for N<sub>h</sub> = 5 or 6 to less than 50% for N<sub>h</sub> = 3 or 4 (panel B in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). <a href=\"#bib27\">Otterstrom et al.

Although approximate, this rescaling takes into account the experimental uncertainties that will make the observed yield lower than modeled by the simulation; for example, the program used to select virus particles will with some frequency pick non-particles (fluorescent spots) that will certainly fail to fuse (at least 7-9% in our published experiments: <a href=\"#bib22\">Ivanovic et al, 2013</a>). Imperfections in the planar bilayer would prevent detection of potential fusion events from particles that might land on them (e.g., stick to glass exposed at a hole in the bilayer). Moreover, within the assumptions of the simulation, the observed yield may not be higher than simulated, and in general lower. In experiments at low Fab concentration, <a href=\"#bib27\">Otterstrom et al. (2014)</a> reported as much as 55% fusion; with IgGs, up to 65% in individual measurements. Even without rescaling, both these values are higher than the simulated values of yield for N<sub>h</sub> = 3 or 4 at low Fab or IgG concentration. The more complete analysis in <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a> rules out N<sub>h</sub> = 3 and disfavors N<sub>h</sub> = 4."

Variation in N<sub>h</sub> between influenza strains supports this mechanism.

The standard analytical treatment of sequential kinetics (the gamma distribution) falls short, because the fusion mechanism involves stochastic events across a large enough interface that one of several potential initiating events will go on to completion.

Although the gamma distribution continues to be a useful tool to correlate experiment and simulation results, an updated analytical model would be needed to capture the fusogenic molecular events at the virus target-membrane interface, as we now understand them. Moreover, while our current simulation model does well in the context of accumulating single-virion membrane fusion data, it is likely that this model also will evolve as we gain new experimental insight. The experiment, computer simulation, and mathematical modeling will continue to evolve together, because they serve as independent tests for mutual validity and reliability and because each can lead to predictions that can be tested by one of the other, complementary approaches."

Flaviviruses have about 25% the surface area of even the smallest influenza virions and can display at most 60 trimers (about 15% of the number on a typical small influenza virus particle). A transition from dimer-clustered E-protein subunits to fusogenic trimers is a component of the mechanism not required when the fusogen is already trimeric like influenza virus HA. Nonetheless, the fusion mechanisms for the two groups of viruses are relatively similar. Trimerization of the flavivirus E-protein subunits and target-membrane engagement of their fusion loops are rate-limiting; hemifusion requires at least two adjacent trimers. Simulations show that trimerization is a bottleneck because of limited availability of competent monomers within the contact zone between virus and target membrane, so that trimer formation must await monomer activation (e.g., dimer dissociation). The basic concepts revealed by our current analyses might thus be generalizable to other viral membrane fusion systems."

It took 10 min at pH5.2 and 37C for about half of the HAs on a virion surface to inactivate irreversibly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The same virions hemifuse with a mean delay of ~1 min at the same pH and at a much lower temperature (23\u00b0C) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ivanovic et al., 2013</a>). According to our current simulation model, for <i>f</i><sub>np\u00a0</sub>=\u00a00.5 and N<sub>h\u00a0</sub>=\u00a03, at the time of hemifusion, an average of 34% of HAs at the target-membrane interface are no longer in the pre-fusion conformation (i.e. have inserted in the target membrane or become inactivated). This is at least an order of magnitude greater than their rate of inactivation on free virions. Because the frequency of non-productive HA refolding is high (at least ~50%), the presence of a target membrane appears to accelerate both productive and non-productive refolding. We illustrate in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> a model that could explain these observations. Receptor engagement might retain HA<sub>1</sub> in a configuration separated from HA<sub>2</sub> (an \u2018open-HA\" conformation) and thereby increase the time interval for fusion peptide release and irreversible HA extension. Receptor engagement might also influence the ratio of membrane insertion to HA inactivation (see our\u00a0earlier\u00a0comment), but an overall increase in the rate of committed HA extension would in any case increase the rate at which HAs reach one or the other of those endpoints. The degree of rate increase (with respect to inactivation of HAs on free virions) will depend on the relationship between the lifetime of the open state and the probability of fusion-peptide release during the interval when HA<sub>1</sub> is not in the way. Udorn HA does not exhibit the same relative increase in the rate of refolding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). After 1 minute of incubation at low pH, most of its virion-associated HAs have assumed the low-pH conformation, but the rate of Udorn hemifusion at pH 5.2 is only ~twofold higher than that of X-31 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ivanovic et al, 2013</a>). Udorn HA, with a destabilized docking of the fusion peptide, appears to have a much greater probability of fusion-peptide release during its unconstrained (i.e. on free virions) open-state lifetime than does X-31 HA, which requires, for comparably rapid extension, the increased open-state lifetime afforded by receptor interactions with HA<sub>1</sub>. The Udorn fusion peptide might, however, be less efficient at inserting into the target membrane, because of the mutation of Gly to Ser at its fourth position. If so, the ratio of non-productive to productive HA transitions might be higher for Udorn than for X-31. The proposed role for HA-receptor contacts in catalysis of membrane fusion, not just in cell attachment, should be directly testable by future single-virion membrane fusion experiments. An important consequence of this possibility is that adjustments in receptor affinity would effectively modulate not only the yield and kinetics of fusion, but also the susceptibility of the virus to neutralization (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>)."

Thus, compensatory changes appear to maintain the overall rate within an acceptable range and imply some degree of independence of the molecular mechanisms that modulate the three fusion-rate determinants. Influenza virus penetrates from low-pH endosomes, and the rate of fusion may have an optimum determined by a balance between the rate of acidification of the virion interior (required to release viral RNPs from the matrix protein [<a href=\"#bib24\">Martin and Helenius, 1991</a>]) and the efficiency of penetration before the virus particle undergoes lysosomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ivanovic et al., 2012</a>).

Distinct mechanisms that independently modulate the properties of this molecular machinery might determine the potential of a given strain to adapt to replication in a new host.

Influenza virions lose their filamentous morphology at low pH (<a href=\"#bib4\">Calder et al., 2010</a>), and we found similar effects when using uranyl acetate. Because of this ambiguity, we included two patch sizes (PS), 121 and 55, in all simulations and comparisons with data in <a href=\"#bib27\">Otterstrom et al.

In brief, we defined a circular contact patch incorporating either 121 or 55 HAs arranged in a hexagonal lattice, where each internal HA has exactly 6 HA neighbors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). For simulations involving virions with a reduced fraction of active HAs, a defined fraction of HAs in random positions within the contact patch were flagged as inactive or unproductive (different random positions for each analyzed virion) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We assumed a single-step process for the irreversible extension of individual HAs leading either to membrane insertion (active HA; productive path, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) or inactivation (unproductive HA; non-productive path, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We first derived lag times for each HA (both active and inactive/unproductive) in the contact patch by random drawing from an exponentially decaying function with rate constant, k<sub>sim</sub> (see below). We then sorted these times in ascending order and defined hemifusion time as the lag-time for the <i>active</i> HA that contributed the final, N<sub>h</sub>th member to the previously inserted group of (N<sub>h</sub>-1) <i>active</i> HA neighbors. Inactive or unproductive HAs simply could not contribute to the inserted HA neighborhood. If the hemifusion event was not detected after the HA with the longest lag time was analyzed, the given \u2018virion\u2019 was flagged as \u2018dead\u2019. The simulation process was repeated as many times (n<sub>total</sub>) as needed to yield ~1000\u20133000 hemifusion events (n<sub>hemi</sub>) for all results shown.

The value for <i>k</i><sub>sim</sub> we used originally, 0.0025 sec<sup>-1</sup>, yields a mean hemifusion delay of ~75 sec (pH-drop to hemifusion, see next paragraph), closely matching those previous experiments (at ~pH5.2-5.5) if we assume that all HAs in the contact patch can contribute to fusion (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ivanovic et al., 2013</a>). To yield a mean hemifusion delay of ~75 sec when 65% of HA molecules in the contact patch are unproductive (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, X31 H3 panel), a higher value for <i>k</i><sub>sim</sub> is required (0.0095 sec<sup>-1</sup>).

Neutral-pH samples were directly mixed with 52.5\u00a0\u00b5l reneutralized buffer (47.5\u00a0\u00b5l pH\u00a05.2 buffer\u00a0pre-mixed\u00a0with 5\u00a0\u00b5l neutralization buffer). At indicated time points reneutralized and neutral samples were split into equal aliquots (0.4\u00a0\u00b5l original virus stock equivalents). One aliquot was loaded directly onto the gel (no trypsin samples in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> or input samples in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). A second aliquot was treated with trypsin (40\u00a0\u00b5g/ml final trypsin concentration) for 30 min on ice (trypsin was inactivated using 0.5-1mM PMSF). The remaining aliquot was subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with conformation-specific anti-HA antibody, LC89 (specific for the low-pH form of HA, HA<sub>2</sub> epitope (<a href=\"#bib34\">Wharton et al., 1995</a>)), as follows. Samples were mixed with ~1.4 \u00b5g (LC89) antibody in a 12 \u00b5l reaction additionally consisting of 1%\u00a0NP40 and incubated overnight at 4C. Protein G beads (Dynabeads, Life Technologies) were washed twice with IP buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH\u00a07.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40) and then resuspended in this buffer. An equivalent of 10\u00a0\u00b5l beads was added to each IP sample in 8 \u00b5l total buffer volume. Bead-containing reactions were incubated for 2 hours with gentle rotation at 4C. Total IP supernatant was mixed with reducing gel sample buffer and boiled. IP pellet (beads) were washed three times with IP buffer, then resuspended in reducing gel sample buffer and boiled. Total IP pellet and supernatant were loaded onto gels."

The authors have previously developed a simulation model for these single virion fusion studies and in this manuscript substantially extend this analysis to gain insight into the dependency of experimental observables (e.g. fusion delay times and fusion yield) as a function of non-active HA trimers, the number of HA trimers required for fusion and the number of antibody Fabs that inhibit fusion. The parameters that govern the overall process of fusion and its susceptibility to inhibition by Fabs suggest why some influenza strains may be more easily neutralized by antibody and how physical attributes of the individual HA trimers can influence both fusion and neutralization. The simulation model also makes specific predictions about individual HA trimer activation rates and contributions to the free energy requirements to drive membrane fusion that are likely to be testable in future experiments."

Thus, the gamma distribution model is indeed questionable if there is a significant fraction of non-productive \"molecules\".

However, we feel that current data strongly favors values for certain fundamental parameters despite some remaining uncertainty. While it is correct that the exact value for the fraction of non-participating sites is patch-size dependent, the values for the number (N<sub>h</sub>) of participating HA neighbors and the derived rate (<i>k</i><sub>e</sub>) of membrane engagement are patch-size independent, and, thus, unique for the current simulation model. We have revised the text to make that clear \u2013 see for example the Results (paragraphs two and three, subheading \u201cFab inhibition of H3 HA\u201d and paragraph two, subheading \u201cFab inhibition of H1 HA\u201d) and the Discussion (paragraph six). It is the differences between the two strains, rather than the specifics of the particular numbers, from which we draw the majority of our conclusions. For example, the different values for N<sub>h</sub> for the H1 and H3 strains support the \u2018tug-of-war\u2019 model of membrane fusion (see Discussion, paragraph one). Further, differences in independent functional variables provide evidence for compensatory features in the evolved mechanism (see Discussion, paragraph eight) and establish a direct link between the fusion mechanism and viral neutralization susceptibility (see <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a> and the Discussion section)."

In that prior paper we provided evidence that the arrest results from target membrane insertions of several HAs anywhere in the area of target-membrane contact.

While there is no direct information for the specific molecular structure of the \u2018extended state\u2019, in the revised <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, we now illustrate two general ways this extra length could be gained. The extension of the N-terminal helical coiled-coil in HA2 that projects the fusion peptides toward the target membrane is essential, while the C-terminal portion of the molecule could either retain the pre-fusion conformation (the first extended-HA intermediate in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) or unfold to allow the onset of fold-back (the second and third extended-HA intermediates). <i>The key point is that rather than representing a unique conformation, the extended state is likely an ensemble of folded-back conformations</i>. We have added a sentence in the Introduction to reflect this point (paragraph three). We have also added a statement in the revised <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> legend that the corresponding distance between the two membranes linked by inserted HAs might fluctuate around a different set of values depending on how many HAs are cooperating."

However, the kinetics of inactivation of HAs on free virions (at least for X31) is significantly slower than in the context of membrane fusion, and this is the reason for including longer time courses for the virion-HA inactivation experiments (shorter time courses for X31 virions would not be informative). We did, however, in response to your suggestion, include an earlier time point for Udorn, which exposes an interesting difference between the two HAs and suggests a model that explains both the slow inactivation of X31 HA on free virions and the differential acceleration of X31 vs. Udorn HAs in association with target membranes. The proposed model fits quite nicely with our evolving interpretations, and we have now included it in the Discussion (paragraph seven).
