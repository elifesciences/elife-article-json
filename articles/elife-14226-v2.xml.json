                    "text": "Yeast studies identified two heterohexameric tethering complexes, which consist of 4 shared (Vps11, Vps16, Vps18 and Vps33) and 2 specific subunits: Vps3 and Vps8 (CORVET) versus Vps39 and Vps41 (HOPS). CORVET is an early and HOPS is a late endosomal tether. The function of HOPS is well known in animal cells, while CORVET is poorly characterized. Here we show that Drosophila Vps8 is highly expressed in hemocytes and nephrocytes, and localizes to early endosomes despite the lack of a clear Vps3 homolog. We find that Vps8 forms a complex and acts together with Vps16A, Dor/Vps18 and Car/Vps33A, and loss of any of these proteins leads to fragmentation of endosomes. Surprisingly, Vps11 deletion causes enlargement of endosomes, similar to loss of the HOPS-specific subunits Vps39 and Lt/Vps41. We thus identify a 4 subunit-containing miniCORVET complex as an unconventional early endosomal tether in Drosophila."

CORVET is an early and HOPS is a late endosomal tether. The function of HOPS is well known in animal cells, while CORVET is poorly characterized. Here we show that Drosophila Vps8 is highly expressed in hemocytes and nephrocytes, and localizes to early endosomes despite the lack of a clear Vps3 homolog. We find that Vps8 forms a complex and acts together with Vps16A, Dor/Vps18 and Car/Vps33A, and loss of any of these proteins leads to fragmentation of endosomes. Surprisingly, Vps11 deletion causes enlargement of endosomes, similar to loss of the HOPS-specific subunits Vps39 and Lt/Vps41. We thus identify a 4 subunit-containing miniCORVET complex as an unconventional early endosomal tether in Drosophila."

Early (also known as sorting) endosomes represent the central hub where this decision is made. This tubulo-vesicular organ can also receive input from the Golgi or other intracellular vesicles. The fate and maturation of endosomes are regulated by several Rab GTPase proteins. Active, GTP-loaded Rabs recruit effectors to the vesicular membranes, which then facilitate the subsequent events, including vesicle targeting and homo- and heterotypic fusions. Intracellular vesicles usually acquire tethering factors and SNARE (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor) proteins that facilitate their fusion. Tethering complexes and proteins cross-link the membranes of the two vesicles/compartments, and may promote SNARE complex assembly and fusion (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hong and Lev, 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib17\">K\u00fcmmel and Ungermann, 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib46\">S\u00fcdhof and Rothman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wickner and Schekman, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zick and Wickner, 2014</a>)."

Four endosomal tethers have been identified to date: the early endosomal tethers Rbsn-5 (Rabenosyn-5), CORVET (Class C core endosome vacuole tethering), the vertebrate-specific EEA1 (Early endosomal antigen 1), and the late endosomal tether HOPS (Homotypic vacuole fusion and protein sorting). The Rbsn-5 protein itself has a tethering function similar to EEA1, whilst CORVET and HOPS are closely related heterohexameric tethering complexes (<a href=\"#bib17\">K\u00fcmmel and Ungermann, 2014</a>). These protein complexes were first identified and characterized in yeast. CORVET binds to Vps21/Rab5 and mediates early endosomal fusions, whereas HOPS binds to Ypt7/Rab7 and mediates late endosomal, autophagosomal and vacuolar fusions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Balderhaar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Markgraf et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Peplowska et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Plemel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Rieder and Emr, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Seals et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wurmser et al., 2000</a>). Both share a common core of class C Vps proteins (Vps11, Vps16, Vps18 and Vps33), and the two Rab-binding subunits are located on opposite ends of these complexes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Br\u00f6cker et al., 2012</a>).

Importantly, among the two CORVET-specific subunits only the homologs of Vps8 can be found in higher eukaryotes, as Vps3 seems to be a fungi-specific protein (<a href=\"#bib14\">Klinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Solinger and Spang, 2013</a>). It was recently demonstrated that one of the mammalian Vps39 homologs, Vps39-2 (also known as Tgfbrap1 or Trap1), can be found in a Vps8-containing CORVET complex (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lachmann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Perini et al., 2014</a>). The function of mammalian CORVET is still poorly characterized: the only functional analysis published to date reported that siRNA knockdown of Vps8 in HeLa cells affects the fusion of only a subset of early endosomes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Perini et al., 2014</a>)."

These sequences are replaced by a 9xHA coding sequence followed by a stop codon, and the SV40 small t intron and polyadenylation site (a widely used genetic element in Drosophila expression vectors). This genomic promoter-driven Vps8-HA construct was inserted randomly into the fly genome. We recovered two stable insertions, one integrated onto the X and another one onto the 3rd chromosome.

These cells utilize a vertebrate-like slit diaphragm and endocytic scavenger receptors to filter the hemolymph, and store or metabolize the endocytosed material (<a href=\"#bib53\">Weavers et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zhuang et al., 2009</a>). As a consequence of this continuously high endocytic activity, the endo-lysosomal compartment fills much of the cytoplasm, and forms distinct layers in garland nephrocytes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). These large binucleated cells are sheathed with a basal membrane, and the underlying plasma membrane forms numerous lacunae with the slit diaphragm located at the openings. Clathrin-coated vesicles and early endosomes form under the lacunae, and are seen as the Rbsn-5 positive layer in fluorescent photographs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). Under this peripheral layer, large electron-lucent vesicles are found that often contain a dense core. These are also part of the endosomal system, and were traditionally referred to as \u03b1-vacuoles (<a href=\"#bib15\">Koenig and Ikeda, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kosaka and Ikeda, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rusten et al., 2006</a>).

DNA sequencing identified a mutant line, vps8<sup>1</sup>, which contains two small deletions, 4 and 12 base pairs, respectively, at the positions targeted by the gRNAs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis confirmed that the frameshift mutation is present in vps8 transcripts in homozygous vps8<sup>1</sup>/vps8<sup>1</sup> mutants as well as in vps8<sup>1</sup>/deficiency (Df) animals, as a primer overlapping the deleted 4 nucleotides failed to amplify the wild type transcript, unlike in control and rescued animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

In line with this, Rab7-positive late endosomes were strongly fragmented in vps8 mutants: the average size of these vesicles strongly decreased relative to the ones in control or rescued animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, the distribution of late endosomes is also altered: Rab7-positive dots almost completely fill the cytoplasm of mutant cells unlike in control or rescued nephrocytes, in which late endosomes form a layer directly beneath peripheral early endosomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, the Rbsn-5 positive early endosomal compartment remains unaffected by the absence of Vps8, indicating that early endosomes form but are unable to fuse and generate properly sized late endosomes in mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We immunoprecipitated Vps8-HA from the genomic promoter-driven vps8-HA; vps8<sup>1</sup>/Df adults and larvae, and analyzed the precipitate by western blots. We found that endogenous Car/Vps33A, Dor/Vps18, and Vps16A all interact with Vps8-HA in both adults and larvae (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, yeast two hybrid experiments showed that Dor/Vps18 directly binds to Vps8 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In line with these, Vps8-HA colocalized with both myc-tagged Dor/Vps18 and endogenous Vps16A in garland nephrocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). Taken together, these data indicate that a CORVET-like complex exists in flies, despite the lack of clear homologs of either yeast Vps3 or mammalian Tgfbrap1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Klinger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Li and Blissard, 2015</a>). In the absence of available antibodies to Drosophila Vps11 and Vps39 proteins, we analyzed the subunit composition of Drosophila CORVET by immunoprecipitation of Vps8-HA as above, followed by tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry. In line with the western blot data, Vps16A, Dor/Vps18, and Car/Vps33A could all be detected as very strong interacting partners of Vps8 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), but neither Vps11 nor Vps39 (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). These data suggested that Vps11 might not be a component of this CORVET-like complex in Drosophila that we thus named miniCORVET, consistent with the lack of hemocyte tumors in vps11 mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

Nephrocytes lacking the HOPS specific subunits Lt or Vps39 showed a very different phenotype: late endosomes were extremely enlarged rather than fragmented, indicating a block of late endosome to lysosome trafficking (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure\u00a07E,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

This further supports that miniCORVET acts independent of Vps11. Double mutants for vps8 and lt had fragmented Rab7 vesicles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>), indicating that miniCORVET is required for the biogenesis of late endosomes while HOPS promotes their clearance.

As expected from the Rab7 stainings, large \u03b1-vacuoles are present in wild type and rescued animals but absent from vps8 mutant cells, which contain only small endosomes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), suggesting endosomal fusion defects. Similarly, the endosomal compartment is fragmented and properly sized \u03b1-vacuoles are missing from nephrocytes lacking Dor/Vps18, Vps16A, Car/Vps33A, and also from cells double mutant for both vps8 and lt (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G\u2013I</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013F</a>). Of note, these cells contain lots of small electron-dense lysosome-like organelles, which are only seen in nephrocytes lacking both miniCORVET and HOPS function. In contrast with these, the ultrastructure of nephrocytes lacking the HOPS-specific subunits (Lt/Vps41 or Vps39) as well as the class C protein Vps11 is very similar to each other but greatly different from cells lacking miniCORVET. The \u03b1-vacuoles of HOPS mutant cells are much larger than those seen in control nephrocytes, and often contain multiple dense cores (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013F,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013I</a>). Multi-core vacuoles with a more electron-dense lumen are also found in the perinuclear region of these cells (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013I</a>). These structures likely arise from the impaired maturation of late endosomes into degradative lysosomes in the absence of HOPS function. Apparently, the formation of such aberrant, enlarged late endosomes and lysosomes requires miniCORVET, because multiple homotypic endosomal fusion cycles can promote the enlargement of endosomes in HOPS mutants."

Considering the fragmented endosomal phenotype, we hypothesized that miniCORVET may cooperate with a partner on early endosomes, such as the other early endosomal tether Rbsn-5. First, miniCORVET colocalizes with Rbsn-5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Second, yeast data showed that class C Vps proteins, including Vps18p/Pep3p, interact with Vac1p/Pep7p, the yeast homolog of Rbsn-5 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Peterson and Emr, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Srivastava et al., 2000</a>). We therefore analyzed the potential binding of Rbsn-5 to either Dor/Vps18 or Vps8 in yeast two hybrid experiments, and detected its strong direct interaction with Dor/Vps18 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Importantly, nephrocytes lacking Rbsn-5 also contained fragmented Rab7-positive endosomes and were devoid of properly sized \u03b1-vacuoles based on ultrastructural analysis (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B,C</a>). These phenotypes are remarkably similar to that of vps8 mutants. Finally, we analyzed the localization of Vps8-HA in cells lacking Rbsn-5. Rab5-positive early endosomes were fragmented and accumulated in the perinuclear region in the absence of Rbsn-5, but these endosomes still contained Vps8-HA (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figurre 10D</a>). These results indicate that Rbsn-5 also acts as an essential early endosomal tether in garland nephrocytes. As cells lacking Vps8 have a normal Rbsn-5 positive endosomal compartment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), the endosomal recruitment of Rbsn-5 and miniCORVET appears to be mutually independent of each other. Strikingly, the formation of properly sized late endosomes and endolysosomes in nephrocytes thus requires the function of both Rbsn-5 and miniCORVET, which could be explained by their cooperative interaction."

The 4 class C Vps proteins (Vps11, 16, 18, 33) form its core that is shared with the HOPS complex, and the 2 specific subunits Vps3 and Vps8 are located on the opposite sides of the complex. Instead of these 2 proteins, the late endosomal tether HOPS contains Vps39 and Vps41. The specific subunits are thought to be important for the bridging of appropriate vesicles, since both complexes act as a tether during vesicle fusions: CORVET is associated with Vps21/Rab5-positive early endosomes, while HOPS localizes to Ypt7/Rab7 containing late endosomes and the vacuole/lysosome, respectively (<a href=\"#bib4\">Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib7\">Br\u00f6cker et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Plemel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Solinger and Spang, 2013</a>). Most of these proteins are conserved in higher eukaryotes, and the composition and function of HOPS is similar to the yeast complex in metazoan cells. CORVET is less well characterized: it contains the specific subunits Vps8 and Tgfbrap1, and associates with a subset of endosomes in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lachmann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Perini et al., 2014</a>)."

Importantly, it is these cells that probably display the highest endocytic activity in the larva. The endolysosomal system occupies much of the cytoplasm in garland nephrocytes, and based on ultrastructural studies, their unusually large late endosomes and lysosomes even deserved a name of their own: \u03b1-vacuoles and \u03b2-vacuoles, respectively (<a href=\"#bib15\">Koenig and Ikeda, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kosaka and Ikeda, 1983</a>). Flies with mutations in genes whose products are required for early endosomal trafficking, such as avl/Syntaxin 7 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lu and Bilder, 2005</a>), Rab5 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wucherpfennig et al., 2003</a>) and Rbsn-5 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Morrison et al., 2008</a>), die during embryonic development. In contrast, vps8 mutant flies are semilethal. Importantly, the structure and pigmentation of their compound eye and the endosomal compartment of mutant wing disc cells remains similar to wild type ones. Late endosomes and likely as a consequence endolysosomes are fragmented in vps8 mutant nephrocytes, and bacteria-containing phagosomes fail to mature into acidic phagolysosomes in hemocytes. These results raise the possibility that CORVET activity is most critical in nephrocytes and hemocytes in Drosophila. It remains to be established whether such remarkably strong phenotypes are also seen in the mammalian kidney and white blood cells in the absence of Vps8."

Based on our vps8 mutant data, the early endosomal tethering activity of Rbsn-5 might be sufficient for endocytic flux in most cells, with the exception of nephrocytes and hemocytes. This is likely due to the very high endocytic activity of these cells, and perhaps also to their unusually large endosomes and phagosomes, as the decreased membrane curvature may require the contribution of a different tether as well. We speculate that in this case, Rbsn-5 may cooperate with a 4-subunit miniCORVET complex through direct binding to Dor, an evolutionarily conserved interaction that was reported earlier between the corresponding yeast homologs, Vac1p/Pep7p and Vps18p/Pep3p (<a href=\"#bib45\">Srivastava et al., 2000</a>). This is further supported by the colocalization of Rbsn-5 with Vps8. Our model would also explain how miniCORVET could act as a tether in Drosophila in the absence of Vps3 and Tgfbrap1 homologs. Importantly, the recruitment of Vps8 and Rbsn-5 to Rab5-positive early endosomes is mutually independent of each other, suggesting that they interact after associating to the surface of these vesicles."

                        "text": "Perhaps the most surprising aspect of our study is that Vps8 appears to act independent of Vps11 in Drosophila. Several lines of evidence support this finding. First of all, the endosomal compartment is fragmented in vps8 mutants as well as in the absence of Vps16A, Dor/Vps18 and Car/Vps33A, whereas loss of the HOPS-specific subunits Vps39 and Lt/Vps41 lead to the enlargement of late endosomes and endolysosomes, a phenotype that is also seen in Vps11 mutant and RNAi cells. A summary of the phenotypes of cells lacking various miniCORVET and HOPS subunits is shown in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>. Second, Vps11 is dispensable for the recruitment of Vps8 to Rab5-positive early endosomes similar to Vps39, while the loss of Rab5, Dor, Car or Vps16A all result in cytoplasmic dispersal of Vps8. Third, our proteomic experiment identified Car, Dor, and Vps16A as interacting partners of Vps8 with 13\u201321 unique peptides for each one, suggesting that these proteins form a stable complex. In contrast, Vps11 was not identified in this immunoprecipitate. Our data go along with those of a recent pulldown study, which identified Vps8, Car, Dor and Vps16A in a search for Rab5 effectors in Drosophila cells, but not Vps11, Vps39 or Lt (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gillingham et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, Vps11 was found in a Rab2 pulldown experiment along with the other 5 HOPS subunits, unlike Vps8 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gillingham et al., 2014</a>). These independent data further support the existence of a full HOPS and the novel, 4-subunit miniCORVET complex in Drosophila."

These vacuoles mature into degradative endolysosomes (\u03b2-vacuoles), possibly by fusing with primary lysosomes. In cells lacking Vps8 (and as a result miniCORVET function), \u03b1-vacuoles remain small and fragmented due to insufficient early endosomal fusion events. In cells lacking HOPS function due to loss of Lt, Vps39 or Vps11, late endosomes fail to mature into degradative lysosomes. Note that \u03b1-vacuoles enlarge into enormous vacuoles containing multiple dense cores in these cells, likely because of the continuous input from early endosomal fusions that are supported by the tethers miniCORVET and Rbsn-5. Nephrocytes lacking both miniCORVET and HOPS function (due to loss of the shared subunits Vps16A, Car, Dor, or the double mutation of Vps8 and Lt) contain fragmented late endosomes as in the case of Vps8 mutants, and accumulate small dense granules (possibly Golgi-derived vesicles transporting lysosomal cargo).

This observation is compatible with our model of Vps11 being dispensable for miniCORVET assembly in the absence of Vps3. We thus propose that unlike a fully formed HOPS complex, a miniCORVET corresponding to the head part of the yeast or mammalian CORVET complexes exist in Drosophila. In addition to its tethering function, recruitment of the SM (Sec1/Munc18) protein Car/Vps33A may also facilitate the fusion of early endosomes by acting as a template for SNARE assembly (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2015</a>)."

In box-and-whisker plots, bars show the data lying between the upper and lower quartiles; the median is indicated as a horizontal line within the box, and whisker plots show the smallest and largest observations. Outliers are not shown. In simple dot plots, the red lines represent mean values. A p-value of 0.01 (or less) was considered to be significant. Accordingly, ** means p&lt;0.01 and *** means p&lt;0.001."

Perhaps as expected from previous work in other systems, they find that Vps8 is needed for the fusion and steady-state maintenance of an early, Rabenosyn-5 positive compartment. A second Vps-C compartment, HOPS, is needed to control docking and steady-state maintenance of a late-endosomal, Rab7-positive compartment. This is also expected. However, Lorincz et al. reveal some surprises as well. First, Vps8 exhibits a strongly tissue-specific localization to nephrocytes and hemocytes, but is doesn't seem to be needed for endosomal function in wing imaginal discs. Second, Vps8 deletion causes expansion of the hemocyte lineage and tumorigenesis. Third, Vps11, long thought to be a core component required for all Vps-C complexes, is dispensable for early endosome function in the hemocyte but still needed (along with HOPS at the late endosome. Interaction studies are consistent with this interpretation and reveal a \"mini-CORVET\" complex seemingly containing four rather than the expected six subunits."

New images showing these phenotypes have been added, please see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B, C</a>. Abnormal immune induction and hemocyte proliferation has previously been shown to cause lethality due to hematopoetic compartment-specific overexpression of PVF2, a PDGF/VEGF-like growth factor (Munier et al. 2002, EMBO reports vol. 3 no.12 pp1195\u20131200). These two references have also been added to the revised manuscript.

Since the overall brain morphology of dissected vps8 mutant larvae and adults appears similar to wild type, and we could not find any obvious alterations in various vps8 mutant neuron types compared to wild type animals in ultrastructural analyses (our unpublished observations), we hypothesize that Vps8 might not play a major role in neurons."

So it was disappointing that the possible function for Vps8 in pigment granule formation was not assessed, given that it requires only a simple cross in a white+ background. An examination of pigment granule phenotypes is warranted, particularly given the long and rich history of Vps-C studies in that context. Probably the first SM allele ever isolated, even before sec1-1, was fly carnation/Vps33A. And, now that I mention it, that paper should be cited in the present manuscript: J.T. Patterson (1932) Genetics 17:38-59.</i>"
