Trans-tight junction flux has been measured across large epithelial surfaces, but conductance across individual channels has never been measured. We report a novel trans-tight junction patch clamp technique that detects flux across individual claudin-2 channels within the tight junction of cultured canine renal tubule or human intestinal epithelial monolayers. In both cells, claudin-2 channels display conductances of ~90 pS. The channels are gated, strictly dependent on claudin-2 expression, and display size- and charge-selectivity typical of claudin-2. Kinetic analyses indicate one open and two distinct closed states. Conductance is symmetrical and reversible, characteristic of a passive, paracellular process, and blocked by reduced temperature or site-directed mutagenesis and chemical derivatization of the claudin-2 pore. We conclude that claudin-2 forms gated paracellular channels and speculate that modulation of tight junction channel gating kinetics may be an unappreciated mechanism of barrier regulation."

Trans-tight junction flux has been measured across large epithelial surfaces, but conductance across individual channels has never been measured. We report a novel trans-tight junction patch clamp technique that detects flux across individual claudin-2 channels within the tight junction of cultured canine renal tubule or human intestinal epithelial monolayers. In both cells, claudin-2 channels display conductances of ~90 pS. The channels are gated, strictly dependent on claudin-2 expression, and display size- and charge-selectivity typical of claudin-2. Kinetic analyses indicate one open and two distinct closed states. Conductance is symmetrical and reversible, characteristic of a passive, paracellular process, and blocked by reduced temperature or site-directed mutagenesis and chemical derivatization of the claudin-2 pore. We conclude that claudin-2 forms gated paracellular channels and speculate that modulation of tight junction channel gating kinetics may be an unappreciated mechanism of barrier regulation."

They act as barriers to control the movement of water, ions and small molecules between internal compartments within the body and the external environment. Some substances are transported across these barriers by passing through individual epithelial cells, but others pass through the spaces between adjacent cells. These spaces are sealed by tight junctions. If the tight junctions do not work properly, it can cause problems with regulating the movement of molecules across epithelial-lined surfaces. This in turn can contribute to diseases in humans, including inflammatory bowel disease and chronic kidney disease."

One member of this family, called claudin-2, allows sodium ions and other small positively charged ions to cross between adjacent cells.

Here, Weber et al. adapted a technique called patch clamping to study the behavior of individual claudin-2 channels in the tight junctions between mammalian epithelial cells."

Further experiments revealed that claudin-2 channels have several states; in one state the channel is fully open, in another the channel is firmly closed, and in the third state the channel is temporarily closed but primed to open."

Such studies may lead to the development of drugs that can alter the activity of these channels to treat particular diseases."

While transcellular transport is mediated by proteins that span the plasma membrane, molecular details of ions, water, and solute transport across the tight junction, i.e. the paracellular path, are less well-defined. This, in part, reflects the absence of tools able to detect single channel events at the tight junction and, therefore, a reliance on methods that measure paracellular flux over large multicellular surfaces (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shen et al., 2011</a>). The limited spatial and temporal resolution of these techniques has contributed to the widely held view of tight junction channels as constitutively open and has limited biophysical characterization of these paracellular channels. Nevertheless, it is clear that paracellular transport is critical to the function of transporting epithelia in many organs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bagnat et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">Simon et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">Wada et al., 2013</a>) and can be regulated by physiological and pathophysiological stimuli (<a href=\"#bib14\">Heller et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">Marchiando et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">Suzuki et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">Turner et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">Weber et al., 2010</a>)."

This is essential for IL-13-induced increases in paracellular Na<sup>+</sup> permeability, as conductance changes are prevented by siRNA-mediated inhibition of claudin-2 upregulation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Weber et al., 2010</a>). Thus, claudin-2 expression is regulated during development and disease. Detailed functional analysis of claudin-2-based channels, in their own right and as models for all paracellular claudin channels, is therefore critical to understanding fundamental mechanisms of development and disease."

Inducible claudin-2 expression in MDCKI monolayers, which lack endogenous claudin-2 expression, is therefore an ideal experimental model in which to define paracellular, trans-tight junction channels (<a href=\"#bib3\">Angelow and Yu, 2009</a>). We analyzed claudin-2 channel function using a novel, trans-tight junction patch clamp technique. Here, we show that this approach can detect discreet conductance events, define these in biophysical terms, perform extensive characterization that demonstrates that the currents detected reflect the activity of trans-tight junction channels, and excludes the possibility that these events are due to apical membrane conductances or other artifacts. The data show that these tight junction channels are gated and behave in a manner reminiscent of traditional transmembrane ion channels despite radical differences in orientation and function. Nevertheless, these similarities, the efficacy of pharmacological effectors of transmembrane ion channel function, and the frequency of epithelial barrier defects in disease suggest that it may be possible to develop agents that positively- or negatively-regulate tight junction channel gating for therapeutic benefit."

As expected based on previous comparisons of MDCKI and MDCKII cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Stevenson et al., 1988</a>), which differ primarily in their expression of claudin-2, induction of claudin-2 expression did not affect tight junction ultrastructure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). When expression was induced, claudin-2 concentrated at tight junctions and, to a limited extent, in cytoplasmic vesicles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Induction of claudin-2 expression also reduced transepithelial electrical resistance (TER; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and increased cationic charge selectivity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) with strict size-selectivity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

This required several technical advances, including development of low profile chambers that allowed apical tight junction access using a 50\u00b0\u201360\u00b0 approach angle while simultaneously viewing cell profiles from below the monolayer. Successful patching of tight junctions also required optimization of cell growth to afford clear morphological delineation of tight junctions while minimizing accumulation of cellular debris that could interfere with pipette sealing. Electrode configuration was also modified so that the pipette was just large enough to span the tight junction, while not so small that it would slip off of the tight junction. This allowed us to achieve a gigaseal with an ~5% success rate. Once a high resistance gigaseal was achieved, it was then possible to measure current through the paracellular pathway in response to an externally applied voltage relative to a basal reference electrode (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

We nevertheless took a pharmacological approach to further examine the hypothesis that these conductance events represented activity of transmembrane ion channels. Three different inhibitor cocktails were added to the patch pipette (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The first cocktail contained 10 mM 4-aminopyridine and 10 mM TEA-Cl to inhibit voltage-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels. The second cocktail contained 100 nM charybdotoxin and 2 \u03bcM apamin to inhibit small conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated K<sup>+</sup> channels. The third cocktail contained 100 \u03bcM amiloride, 20 \u03bcM CFTR inhibitor-172 (inh-172), and 250 \u03bcM 4,4'-Diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS) to block epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channels, CFTR, and anion exchangers respectively. None of these affected frequency or amplitude of the claudin-2-dependent ~9 pA events detected by trans-tight junction patch clamp. We therefore conclude, on the basis of biophysical, molecular, and pharmacological data, that the ~9 pA events detected represent single-channel conductances across the tight junction."

Use of the trans-tight junction patch clamp in conjunction with biionic substitution showed that the channels were permeable to methylamine (radius=1.9\u2009\u00c5) and that, like Na<sup>+</sup>, the V<sub>rev</sub> of methylamine was close to 0 mV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

Thus, basolateral Na<sup>+</sup> replacement with these larger cations induced a large negative shift in channel reversal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>). Global analyses of claudin-2-expressing MDCK by biionic substitution demonstrated tight junction size-selectivity that paralleled that of conductance events detected by trans-tight junction patch clamp (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). In addition to providing another biophysical measure in which the claudin-2-dependent events detected by trans-tight junction patch clamp are similar to claudin-2-dependent paracellular conductances measured by traditional averaging approaches, these data provide further support for the conclusion that the events detected cannot represent apical K<sup>+</sup> channels, as the latter are highly-selective and do not accommodate cations as large as methylamine. It is, however, interesting to note that the permeability of methylamine, relative to Na<sup>+</sup>, is greater in patch clamp measurements than in global measurements. We do not know the reason for this, but could speculate that it may be an artifact of the physical forces created by sealing the patch pipette over the junction. However, even if that explanation was correct, the fact that permeabilities of tetramethylamine and N-methyl-D-glucamine, relative to Na<sup>+</sup>, are unaffected and that charge selectivity is maintained show that such effects, if present, are limited. These data therefore demonstrate that the claudin-2 dependent channel represents a passive paracellular conductance pathway with charge- and size-selectivities similar to those measured across large epithelial sheets."

Trans-tight junction patch clamp recordings demonstrated that MTSET markedly reduced NP<sub>o</sub> of MDCKI monolayers expressing claudin-2<sup>I66C</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,H,J</a>) with kinetics similar to MTSET inhibition measured by global approaches (<a href=\"#bib3\">Angelow and Yu, 2009</a>).

In most cases, MTSET completely abolished events detected by trans-tight junction patch clamp in monolayers expressing claudin-2<sup>I66C</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>), but a few residual events persisted in some monolayers (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). These MTSET-resistant events were identical in size to those observed prior to MTSET addition (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a>), suggesting that MTSET inhibits each claudin-2 channel either completely or not at all. The small number of MTSET-resistant channels occurred in a subset of monolayers, suggesting that this may reflect the lability of MTSET in aqueous solutions. Alternatively, the observation that events detected in MTSET-treated claudin-2<sup>I66C</sup>-expressing monolayers had conductances of ~92 pS, similar to monolayers expressing claudin-2<sup>WT</sup> could be interpreted as support for a role of Ile<sup>66</sup> in claudin-2 gating. In either case, these data show that site-directed mutagenesis and chemical derivatization of Ile<sup>66</sup> blocks local conductance events in a specific manner. Because claudin-2 is concentrated at the tight junction and has not been demonstrated to create transmembrane channels, this result provides further support for the conclusion that events represent flux across paracellular, i.e. tight junction, channels."

Further, single channel events were inhibited by La<sup>3+</sup>, reduced temperature, and, more specifically, cysteine mutagenesis and chemical derivitization of Ile<sup>66</sup> within the claudin-2 pore. In contrast, attempts to block single claudin-2 openings with numerous established transmembrane ion channel blockers were unsuccessful. Moreover, the symmetrical behavior and size-selectivity of the claudin-2-dependent events detected by trans-tight junction patch clamp are inconsistent with known and predicted transmembrane, e.g. apical or basolateral membrane, ion channels.

It has been proposed that these strands establish the paracellular barrier and that the strands are also populated by \u201cchannels\u201d which impart charge and size selectivity. Whether these channels, commonly referred to as the pore pathway (<a href=\"#bib32\">Shen et al., 2011</a>), are open at steady state or can open and close was previously unknown. Our data show that tight junctions are populated by highly dynamic, gated channels that transition between at least three different states. The means by which these functional state transitions occur and whether they are or can be regulated is one interesting question that follows from the results presented here. Further, as investigators in this area seek to model claudin channel function based on the published crystal structure of claudin-15 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Suzuki et al., 2014</a>), our data indicate that any model applied to claudin-2 must include an explanation for rapid opening and closing of the channel.

Indeed, we did observe short-lived, step-wise conductance increases, consistent with a parallel opening of a second claudin-2 channel, superimposed on a typical initial opening (e.g., <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B</a>,<a href=\"#fig6\">6B,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7G</a>). Alternatively, the multi-strand tight junction ultrastructure and corresponding conductance model proposed by Claude (<a href=\"#bib7\">Claude, 1978</a>) suggest that channels are also arranged in series. If true, this would indicate that the NP<sub>o</sub> measured here for current across the entire height of the tight junction significantly underestimates the NP<sub>o</sub> of individual claudin-2 channels. Consistent with this, we did observed some variability in claudin-2-dependent current amplitude. This could be related to the specific configuration of a claudin-2 channel within a given submicron segment of tight junction. For example, heterogeneity may be due to variations in baseline strand conductance, different numbers of tight junction strands, or variations in strand branch points within a particular patch of tight junction. Indeed, the anastamosing arrangement of tight junction strands may be a mechanism that limits lateral spread of current from single channel openings within any individual strand."

When the pipette was sealed to the monolayer, resistance of the seal leak, i.e. the path resulting from incomplete electrical isolation at the edges of the pipette, was determined to be ~30 G\u03a9, based on the steady-state current of (~3.5 pA) at -100 mV when the pipette was sealed over the junction of claudin-2-deficient monolayers composed of either parental or uninduced, transfected MDCKI cells. The resistance of the paracellular shunt pathway (outside of the pipette) is simply the measured resistance of the monolayer, which ranged from 100 to 1,500 \u03a9\u00b7cm<sup>2</sup>, i.e. 0.0003 to 0.0045 M\u03a9. Because this resistance is so much lower than any other pathway measured, it is essentially 0 for these analyses, as it cannot significantly impact conductance events of the types measured here.

Two additional pathways, measuring ~9 pA and ~4 pA events were present only when the pipette was sealed over the junction. The ~9 pA at 100 mV, or 11 G\u03a9, events were present in MDCKI or Caco-2<sub>BBe</sub> cells expressing both high and low levels of claudin-2, but were absent in cells devoid of claudin-2, i.e. the parental MDCKI line. The frequency of detection correlated with claudin-2 expression indicating that these events are strictly claudin-2 dependent.

We and others have shown that occludin- and ZO-1 are both important to leak pathway regulation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buschmann et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">Van Itallie et al., 2009</a>) and that, in the intestine, increased leak pathway permeability is induced by TNF via a myosin light chain kinase-dependent process (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buschmann et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">Clayburgh et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">Van Itallie et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">Zolotarevsky et al., 2002</a>). Our in vitro studies suggest that this pathway may have an effective radius of 62.5\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buschmann et al., 2013</a>). We did not, however, detect a defined population of very large openings in any of our patch clamp recordings. This suggests that the\u00a0leak pathway has limited or no dynamic gating, are extremely rare, or cannot be distinguished from electrode seal loss. Alternatively, some investigators have proposed that the leak pathway opens as one tight junction strand at a time, with materials trapped between strands until the next channel opens (<a href=\"#bib28\">Sasaki et al., 2003</a>). In this case, it would be very difficult to detect these larger events. However, they could impact the effective\u00a0conductance of claudin-2 channel opening events, and thus potentially explain the variability in amplitude that we observed. It has also been suggested that leak pathway flux occurs primarily at tricellular tight junctions. We therefore attempted to seal patch pipettes over tricellular contacts. Unfortunately, either the geometry or small size of these regions makes it exceedingly difficult to place and seal an electrode. We therefore conclude that either a significant technical revision to our trans-tight junction patch clamp or completely different approaches will be required to perform single channel analyses of the leak pathway or tricellular tight junction."

Unlike conventional transmembrane ion channels, which regulate flux between extracellular and intracellular compartments, the channels depicted here bridge two extracellular compartments, lumen and tissue, and, therefore, represent an entirely new class of gated ion channels. Together with mutagenesis and structural analyses, the ability to detect individual conductance events, as described here, will be a critical tool in determination of molecular mechanisms that regulate channel assembly and gating. Such studies may lead to development of pharmacological means of modulating gating activity for therapeutic purposes."

This was particularly true for Caco-2<sub>BBe</sub> recordings and we speculate that this prevents disordered well-developed microvilli from interfering with seal formation. Osmolarity was adjusted to 300 mOsm using mannitol to facilitate seal formation. The normal pipette solution was 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KOH, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, with 290 mOsm. When 4-aminopyridine, TEA, charybdotoxin, or apamin were included in the pipette, [NaCl] was reduced to maintain osmolarity. La<sup>3+</sup> (5 mM) and MTSET (1 mM) were added to both apical and basolateral chambers, but not included in the apical pipette solution. Pipette offsets were zeroed upon access of the recording electrode to the extracellular solution and with the electrode far from the monolayer. For local dilution potential measurements, bathing solution or pipette solution was replaced with HBSS in which 90% of the NaCl was isosmotically replaced with mannitol. For local biionic potential measurements, bathing solution was replaced isosmotically with methylamine chloride (MACl), tetramethylamine chloride (TMACl), or <i>N</i>-methyl-D-glucamine chloride (NMDGCl) as indicated. V<sub>rev</sub> of opening events was determined during repetitive 1\u2009s voltage ramps from \u2212100 to +100 mV with holding potentials of \u2212100 mV. For the purposes of subtracting steady state conductance, ramps in which no openings were detected were subtracted from ramps which contained openings. The relatively short duration of these ramps permitted data oversampling at 100 KHz and <i>post hoc</i> data averaging down to 10 KHz. This provided a somewhat smaller amount of noise compared to the steady state recordings and allowed more accurate measurement of current reversal potentials. Patch clamp data and simulated currents were analyzed using Clampfit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All points histograms were generated using 0.1 pA bin size and normalized to record duration (samples/s). Data were fit to Gaussian distributions. Secondary analyses to determine absolute event counts, open and closed durations, and event conductances were performed using Clampfit event detection software. Channel activity was expressed as open probability (NP<sub>o</sub>) which was determined from the equation below (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Rane, 1993</a>):"

The density of \u2018beads\u2019 along the strands has been measured as ~55 per linear m (Anderson. News Physiol Sci. 2001). However it is not clear if each \u2018bead\u2019 represents one, more than one, or only part of a channel. In terms of changing their distribution, we have performed FRAP analyses of claudin-2 and find that the mobile fraction is only 33% (Raleigh et al. J Cell Biol. 2011). Others have reported values below 10% (Capaldo et al. Mol Biol Cell. 2014). It is therefore unlikely that macroscopic changes in claudin-2 distribution significantly affect our results here. Molecular redistribution, such as pore disassembly, could explain the closed state with longer latency defined by our data and, interestingly, have kinetics compatible with the observed rate of FRAP recovery. We have now speculated on this in the text: \u201cOne possibility is that the prolonged state (closed<sub>stable</sub>) [\u2026] and we cannot exclude this as a possible regulatory mechanism.\u201d"

J Cell Biol. 2011), and we have defined the mechanism of claudin-1 FRAP recovery to be intra-junctional diffusion (Shen et al. J Cell Biol. 2008). Finally, the half-life of claudin-2 in MDCK cells is greater than 9 hrs (van Itallie et al. J.

The primary issue here is, therefore, what is being measured by the capillary electrode when ~9 pA events are detected. As a whole, the data show that these conductances have both size- and charge-selectivity that are expected, based on measurements across larger monolayers, of claudin-2 channels. In addition, as expected for a paracellular pathway, they are symmetrical and have a reversal potential near 0. Finally, obstruction of the claudin-2 pore by a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and chemical derivatization verifies that the claudin-2 pore is essential to the genesis of these events."
