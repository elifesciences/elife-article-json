Next, they undertook a large-scale sequencing effort to identify and compare these two biosynthetic genes from this sampling of soil-dwelling bacteria (<a href=\"#bib1\">Charlop-Powers et al., 2015</a>)."

The ability to make natural products is clearly important, as many well-studied soil bacteria devote significant portions of their genomes to the production of natural products, in some cases up to 10% (<a href=\"#bib6\">Udwary et al., 2007</a>). It has long been assumed that these compounds are defensive, as many natural products have antibiotic activity and confer fitness benefits to producers competing for nutrients (<a href=\"#bib4\">Kinkel et al., 2014</a>). However, doses of these compounds that are too low to inhibit or kill other microbes can still alter their gene expression, and this scenario may be more relevant in the environment (<a href=\"#bib3\">Goh et al., 2002</a>). Given the vast diversity of biosynthetic potential uncovered in this survey, are the functions and impacts of natural products in the environment equally varied?"

By using known sequences from characterized gene clusters, the researchers identified samples enriched with biosynthetic genes similar to those associated with biomedically relevant compounds. These biosynthetic \u2018hot spots\u2019 may serve as starting points to search for structurally similar molecules with, hopefully, equally potent activities. The challenge now will be to work out how to translate sequence information into chemical reality, and further, how to begin to access not just small variations in old chemistry, but completely new chemical scaffolds."
