A new pathway controlling PP2A activity in mitosis has been recently described. This pathway includes the Greatwall (GWL) kinase and its substrates endosulfines. At mitotic entry, GWL is activated and phosphorylates endosulfines that then bind and inhibit PP2A. We analysed whether GWL overexpression could participate in cancer development. We show that GWL overexpression promotes cell transformation and increases invasive capacities of cells through hyperphosphorylation of the oncogenic kinase AKT. Interestingly, AKT hyperphosphorylation induced by GWL is independent of endosulfines. Rather, GWL induces GSK3 kinase dephosphorylation in its inhibitory sites and subsequent SCF-dependent degradation of the PHLPP phosphatase responsible for AKT dephosphorylation. In line with its oncogenic activity, we find that GWL is often overexpressed in human colorectal tumoral tissues. Thus, GWL is a human oncoprotein that promotes the hyperactivation of AKT via the degradation of its phosphatase, PHLPP, in human malignancies."

A new pathway controlling PP2A activity in mitosis has been recently described. This pathway includes the Greatwall (GWL) kinase and its substrates endosulfines. At mitotic entry, GWL is activated and phosphorylates endosulfines that then bind and inhibit PP2A. We analysed whether GWL overexpression could participate in cancer development. We show that GWL overexpression promotes cell transformation and increases invasive capacities of cells through hyperphosphorylation of the oncogenic kinase AKT. Interestingly, AKT hyperphosphorylation induced by GWL is independent of endosulfines. Rather, GWL induces GSK3 kinase dephosphorylation in its inhibitory sites and subsequent SCF-dependent degradation of the PHLPP phosphatase responsible for AKT dephosphorylation. In line with its oncogenic activity, we find that GWL is often overexpressed in human colorectal tumoral tissues. Thus, GWL is a human oncoprotein that promotes the hyperactivation of AKT via the degradation of its phosphatase, PHLPP, in human malignancies."

Biochemical experiments in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts demonstrated that during mitosis GWL is required to inhibit the protein phosphatase 2A complexed to B55 regulatory subunit (PP2AB55), a\u00a0phosphatase that dephosphorylates cyclinB-cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) substrates (<a href=\"#bib9\">Castilho et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Vigneron et al., 2009</a>). However, PP2AB55 inhibition by GWL is not direct, but through phosphorylation of the two endosulfines ARPP19 and ENSA that once phosphorylated bind and inhibit PP2AB55 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mochida et al., 2010</a>). The mammalian orthologue of GWL, originally named Microtubule-Associated Serine Threonine Kinase Like (MASTL), is also involved in the control of mitotic division. <i>MASTL</i> silencing in human cells and knockout in mice increase PP2AB55 activation and decrease phosphorylation of cyclinB-CDK1 substrates leading to important mitotic defects (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alvarez-Fernandez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Burgess et al., 2010</a>). GWL kinase activity is tightly regulated during mitotic division by phosphorylation at the C\u00a0terminus and the T-loop domains, possibly by cyclinB-CDK1 and the <i>Xenopus</i> orthologue of the Polo-like kinase (PLX1) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Vigneron et al., 2011</a>).

This holoenzyme comprises three subunits: a catalytic subunit (PP2AC, or C subunit), a scaffolding subunit (PP2AA, or A subunit) and a regulatory subunit (PP2AB, or B subunit) that is responsible for substrate specificity. This assembly complexity is crucial for PP2A large substrate repertoire and wide diversity of physiological functions (<a href=\"#bib20\">Janssens et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Virshup and Shenolikar, 2009</a>). Several PP2A holoenzymes are considered to be tumour suppressors and are functionally inactivated in cancer. Loss of activity of distinct PP2A holocomplexes mediates oncogenesis by activating different signalling pathways, including the kinases AKT and mitotic-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andrabi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 2006</a>). Particularly, PP2AB55 deregulation has been observed in breast, prostate, and colon cancers.

To this aim, we stably overexpressed pMXs-based constructs encoding wild type (WT), hyperactive kinase (K72M) or kinase dead (G44S) GWL or with empty vector (CT) into MCF10A cells, and we compared their proliferative and transforming capacities to those observed in MCF10A overexpressing the V12Ras oncogene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Stably overexpressed V12Ras and WT and K72M GWL forms are shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. The levels of these three ectopic proteins are similar, although we often observed a lower expression of the hyperactive form of GWL. Increased expression of WT and K72M GWL forms significantly raised cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), reduced cell contact inhibition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and promoted anchorage independent-cell growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) compared to control cells (CT), although in a lesser extent than V12Ras overexpression. Interestingly, overexpression of G44S GWL induced cell death probably by acting as a dominant negative since when the levels of WT GWL were increased concomitantly with those of a G44S GWL no effect on cell viability was observed (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similar results were obtained in NIH3T3. In these cell lines, kinase dead GWL expression was lethal, whereas overexpression of WT or hyperactive GWL strongly promoted cell proliferation, invasion and migration and decreased cell<b>\u2014</b>cell contact inhibition (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Overexpression of WT GWL did not overtly affect the cell phenotype. Conversely, overexpression of K72M GWL led to accumulation of cells with a double DNA content (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, FACs profile) and cell senescence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, \u03b2-galactosidase staining), a characteristic feature of activated oncogene overexpression in cultured primary cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lowe et al., 2004</a>). As it has been reported that human fibroblast transformation by some oncogenes, such as Ras (<a href=\"#bib23\">Land et al., 1983</a>), requires cell immortalisation and inhibition of the p53 pathway, we then overexpressed WT and K72M GWL in human fibroblasts immortalised by overexpression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and SV40 large T antigen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). As expected, accumulation of cells with double DNA content arrest was no longer observed in K72M GWL overexpressing cells. Moreover, proliferation of fibroblasts expressing WT or K72M GWL strongly increased (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) to levels comparable to those induced by the V12-Ras oncogene and anchorage-independent growth was promoted (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), demonstrating that GWL has transforming capacity."

We chose MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231-D3H2LN (D3H2LN) breast cancer cell lines. These cells present similar genetic background (D3H2LN coming from MDA-MB-231 cells) but different metastatic potential (D3H2LN: high metastatic clone of MDA-MB-231 selected by subcutaneous mouse xenograft). As expected, D3H2LN cells presented increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion than MDA-MB-231 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, CT versus D3H2LN). Interestingly, the former cells also displayed higher GWL expression levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> upper panels). To test whether the different invasive behaviour of these cell lines could be mediated by GWL overexpression, we stably overexpressed WT, K72M, and G44S GWL in MDA-MB-231 cells (displaying low endogenous GWL levels and metastatic capacity) and knocked down GWL by shRNA in D3H2LN cells (presenting high endogenous GWL levels and metastatic capacity). Overexpression of WT and particularly K72M GWL in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly increased cell proliferation, invasion, and migration to reach similar levels than D3H2LN cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Conversely, unlike its negative effect on cell viability in NIH3T3 and MCF10A cells, overexpression of G44S GWL did not affect cell behaviour in MDA-MB-231 cells probably due to the fact that they display higher endogenous GWL levels."

Our results show a decrease of the phosphorylation of the inhibitory sites of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) (S9/S21) in both GWL overexpressing MDA-MB-231 and SW480 cells as well as an increase of the phosphorylation of AKT on S473. Moreover, AKT phosphorylation on S473 was significantly reduced in <i>GWL</i> knockdown D3H2LN and SW620 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). No difference in AKT phosphorylation at T308 was observed (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).\u00a0We confirmed the effect of GWL on AKT phosphorylation at S473 by Western blot analysis in these cells and in NIH3T3, HeLa, MCF10A cells, and primary human fibroblasts. AKT phosphorylation on S473 was significantly increased in all these cell lines when WT or K72M GWL were overexpressed (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), whereas no effect was observed when the kinase dead form was used. Conversely, S473 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in SW620 and D3H2LN cells that stably express the <i>GWL</i> shRNA compared to cells expressing SH LUC. These results suggest that GWL overexpression could promote the oncogenic properties of these cells by increasing AKT phosphorylation at S473."

First, by performing a dose-response analysis, we found that 1 \u03bcM was the highest dose of inhibitor that did not significantly affect cell proliferation in parental MDA-MB-231 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Then, we assessed the effect of this dose on phosphorylation on S473 of AKT, cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and anchorage-independent growth in cells overexpressing WT GWL or an empty pMXs vector (CT) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). As expected, 1 \u03bcM of AKT inhibitor did not have any effect in MDA-MB231 control cells. Conversely, in GWL overexpressing cells AKT phosphorylation was reduced and cell proliferation, invasion, and migration significantly decreased to levels close or equal to those observed in controls. Moreover, inhibitor VIII also strongly reduced the capacity of GWL-overexpressing MCF10A cells to grow in soft agar. We obtained similar results in SW480 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and confirmed them with another AKT inhibitor (MK2206) in MDA-MB-231 and MCF10A cells (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). However, we did not observe any effect on S473 AKT phosphorylation or cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231 GWL overexpressed cells when other kinase controlling cell proliferation such as MEK was inhibited (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

We thus tested whether GWL induced AKT phosphorylation at S473 through ARPP19/ENSA-dependent inhibition of PP2AB55 by stably overexpressing ARPP19 and ENSA (WT and the respective S62A and S67A mutants that cannot be phosphorylated by GWL) in MCF10A cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Cell proliferation was increased following WT ARPP19 overexpression, although significantly less than following overexpression of WT or K72M GWL. Conversely, proliferation was not affected by overexpression of S62A ARPP19, indicating that increased proliferation induced by WT ARPP19 overexpression is dependent on the binding and inhibition of PP2AB55. No change in cell proliferation was observed upon overexpression of WT or S67A ENSA. Moreover, none of these proteins had any effect on AKT phosphorylation at S473, supporting the hypothesis that AKT activation upon GWL overexpression is not mediated by ARPP19/ENSA-dependent PP2AB55 inhibition."

As our data suggest that induction of AKT phosphorylation on S473 by GWL overexpression is the result of decreased dephosphorylation of this site, we tested whether GWL modulate PHLPP protein levels. First, we evaluated endogenous PHLPP in MDA-MB-231, MCF10A and SW480 cells that overexpress WT or the indicated mutants of GWL, ARPP19 or ENSA and in D3H2LN and SW620 treated with control (shLUC) or a GWL shRNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). PHLPP levels were significantly decreased in MDA-MB-231 cells and were completely undetectable in MCF10A and SW480 cells overexpressing WT or K72M GWL, whereas no effect on the endogenous levels of this phosphatase was observed when either WT or mutant ARPP19 and ENSA were overexpressed. On the contrary, the knockdown of GWL promoted an increase of the levels of this phosphatase. Analysis of PHLPP protein levels in GWL-overexpressing or control MCF10A cells transiently transfected with PHLPP at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10\u2009hr after addition of cycloheximide indicated that GWL overexpression strongly promoted PHLPP proteolysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). It has been previously reported that PHLPP levels are regulated by a GSK3-dependent phosphorylation of this protein in four different sites followed by SKP1-Cullin-Fbox-\u03b2TrCP (SCF-\u03b2TrCP)-mediated ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2009</a>). In order to check whether PHLPP proteolysis induced in GWL overexpressed cells is proteasome dependent, we added the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to the culture media. Under these conditions, PHLPP was accumulated in both CT and GWL overexpressing MCF10A cells, although the accumulation observed in CT cells was far below the one induced in GWL overexpressing cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We next checked whether this degradation is ubiquitin-dependent. To answer this question we overexpressed a mutant of PHLPP in which the four sites (S847, T851, S867 and S869) phosphorylated by GSK3 were substituted by alanines (PHLPP\u2013S/T4A). This mutant cannot be ubiquitinated by the SCF-\u03b2TrCP and is not degraded (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2009</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, PHLPP\u2013S/T4A levels were maintained in both CT and GWL-overexpressing MCF10A cells treated with cycloheximide indicating that GWL overexpression promotes SCF-\u03b2TrCP-dependent ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of PHLPP."

As phosphorylation of the inhibitory sites of GSK3 is reduced in GWL-overexpressing MDA-MB-231, SW480, and MCF10A cells and increased in D3H2LN and SW620 GWL knockdown cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), we tested whether GSK3 inhibition could affect PHLPP levels in GWL-overexpressing cells. As expected, PHLPP protein level was reduced in GWL-overexpressing cells compared with control cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, GWL and CT, 0 \u03bcM). However, addition of a GSK3 inhibitor (from 2.5 to 10 \u03bcM) increased in a dose-dependent manner PHLPP levels in GWL-overexpressing cells but not in control cells. This suggests that PHLPP level reduction in GWL-overexpressing cells is the consequence of increased GSK3 activity that leads to PHLPP ubiquitination and degradation."

Accordingly, <i>GWL</i> knockdown in more aggressive breast and colon cell lines (D3H2LN and SW620 cells, respectively) decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion to levels comparable to those observed in less metastatic cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and SW480). The opposite effect was observed when GWL was overexpressed in the less metastatic cell lines. Finally, we show that GWL levels modulate tumour growth in vivo as well (three-fold increase of tumour size in tumours derived from cancer cells overexpressing GWL and two-fold decrease in tumours obtained from cancer cells in which <i>GWL</i> was silenced compared to controls)."

These results indicate that phosphorylation of S473/AKT could be due to an inhibition of the phosphatase(s) responsible for its dephosphorylation. Our findings clearly demonstrate that AKT phosphorylation on S473 is not mediated by inhibition of PP2AB56 or of PP2AB55 through ARPP19/ENSA phosphorylation. Instead, they support the hypothesis that GWL overexpression stimulates the degradation of PHLPP, the phosphatase responsible for AKT dephosphorylation on S473 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gao et al., 2005</a>). PHLPP levels were significantly reduced in all GWL overexpressing cell lines due to increased ubiquitin and proteasome-dependent degradation. Moreover, PHLPP overexpression completely reversed the phenotype induced by GWL overexpression. To be targeted for proteosomal degradation, PHLPP is first phosphorylated by GSK3 and then ubiquitinated by SCF-\u03b2TrCP (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2009</a>). We observed a decrease of the phosphorylation levels of the GSK3 inhibitory residues S9/S21 upon GWL overexpression, suggesting that the lower PHLPP levels in GWL overexpressing cells are the result of GSK3 hyperactivation. Accordingly GSK3 inhibition induced a dramatic increase of PHLPP levels in GWL-overexpressing MCF10A cells, whereas no effect was observed in control cells."

Our results suggest that GWL phosphorylates another protein(s) to promote GSK3 activation through dephosphorylation of its inhibitory sites (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). This would result in PHLPP ubiquitination and degradation and in the subsequent increase of AKT phosphorylation on S473 that confers to this protein robust transforming and metastatic capacities. However, the molecular mechanisms by which GWL promotes dephosphorylation of the inhibitory sites of GSK3 need to be further elucidated. In this line, it is known that AKT promotes phosphorylation of GSK3 in S9/S21 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2009</a>), however, GWL overexpressed cells display a hyperactivated AKT but a S9/S21 dephosphorylated GSK3. One possible explanation for this counterintuitive physiological situation is that GWL would mediate dephosphorylation of the inhibitory sites of GSK3 by promoting the hyperactivation of the phosphatase responsible of this dephosphorylation. This would move the balance between phosphorylation of these sites by AKT\u00a0and dephosphorylation by the phosphatase regulated by GWL towards dephosphorylated and activated GSK3."

Besides its transforming capacity, GWL also confers robust invasive capacities to transformed cells.

Once acquired, fluorescent signals were quantified by applying a phantom (=pseudocells) segmentation. GWL fluorescent signal was evaluated in areas delimited for each spot by DAPI staining and plotted as histograms, from which median intensity values were extracted. These median intensities were then reported in a scatter dot plot to compare GWL expression level in normal and tumour tissue. Data were computed and analysed using Excel and GraphPad."

Overexpression of GWL is shown to stimulate the proliferation of different immortalized cell lines and to induce cell transformation as well as enhanced migration and invasion. Conversely, GWL downregulation impairs the tumorigenic properties of two cancer cell lines. Importantly, the tumor-promoting activity of GWL appears to be independent of ARPP19 and ENSA, two key substrates of GWL in the regulation of mitosis, but instead correlates with the phosphorylation of AKT on Ser473. The authors present a number of experiments supporting that GWL tumorigenic effects are mediated by AKT and that GWL-induced degradation of the phosphatase PHLPP may account for its ability to activate AKT. GWL is also shown to be overexpressed in some colorectal tumors."
