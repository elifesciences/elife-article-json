In M71 transgenic mice with a \u201cmonoclonal nose\u201d, glomerular input patterns in the olfactory bulb are massively perturbed and olfactory behaviors are altered. To gain insights into how olfactory circuits can process such degraded inputs we characterized odor-evoked responses of olfactory bulb mitral cells and interneurons. Surprisingly, calcium imaging experiments reveal that mitral cell responses in M71 transgenic mice are largely normal, highlighting a remarkable capacity of olfactory circuits to normalize sensory input. In vivo whole cell recordings suggest that feedforward inhibition from olfactory bulb periglomerular cells can mediate this signal normalization. Together, our results identify inhibitory circuits in the olfactory bulb as a mechanistic basis for many of the behavioral phenotypes of mice with a \u201cmonoclonal nose\u201d and highlight how substantially degraded odor input can be transformed to yield meaningful olfactory bulb output."

In M71 transgenic mice with a \u201cmonoclonal nose\u201d, glomerular input patterns in the olfactory bulb are massively perturbed and olfactory behaviors are altered. To gain insights into how olfactory circuits can process such degraded inputs we characterized odor-evoked responses of olfactory bulb mitral cells and interneurons. Surprisingly, calcium imaging experiments reveal that mitral cell responses in M71 transgenic mice are largely normal, highlighting a remarkable capacity of olfactory circuits to normalize sensory input. In vivo whole cell recordings suggest that feedforward inhibition from olfactory bulb periglomerular cells can mediate this signal normalization. Together, our results identify inhibitory circuits in the olfactory bulb as a mechanistic basis for many of the behavioral phenotypes of mice with a \u201cmonoclonal nose\u201d and highlight how substantially degraded odor input can be transformed to yield meaningful olfactory bulb output."

Odor molecules bind to receptor proteins that are embedded in the surface of the olfactory sensory neuron. Different receptors respond to different odors, and the nose contains hundreds of different receptors that work together to distinguish thousands of scents. When an odor molecule binds to a receptor, it triggers a pattern of electrical activity in the neuron. These patterns are the building blocks that allow smells to be recognized and if necessary, acted upon \u2013 by not eating food that smells rancid, for example."

In mice, each olfactory sensory neuron expresses only one of ~1300 odorant receptor genes, and each of these receptors interacts with multiple odorants (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chess et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Malnic et al., 1999</a>). Neurons expressing a given receptor are distributed randomly across large zones of the olfactory epithelium, but project to two spatially invariant glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, the first processing center of olfactory information in the mammalian brain (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ressler et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vassar et al., 1994</a>).

The spatiotemporal patterns of mitral cell firing are strongly shaped by the activity of local inhibitory neurons, including periglomerular cells, EPL interneurons, and granule cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Banerjee et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fukunaga et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kato et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Luo and Katz, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Miyamichi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yokoi et al., 1995</a>).

In these mice, more than 95% of all olfactory sensory neurons express a single odorant receptor, M71. As a consequence of this genetic manipulation, the frequency of sensory neurons expressing endogenous odorant receptor genes is reduced 20-fold, and the canonical glomerular odor map observed in wild-type mice disappears: most odorants now fail to elicit detectable levels of glomerular activity, while the majority of glomeruli respond to acetophenone, a known M71 ligand (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Moreover, M71 transgenic mice fail to discriminate acetophenone, a known strong M71 ligand, from air in this go/no go discrimination assay, despite the fact that acetophenone activates the vast majority of sensory neurons and glomeruli in these mice."

Conversely, what underlies the inability of these mice to detect the pervasive glomerular activity evoked by acetophenone? To explore the link between odor-evoked sensory neuron activity and behavior we analyzed the activity of olfactory bulb mitral cells, the main output neurons of the olfactory bulb. Two-photon calcium imaging and whole cell patch-clamp recordings of mitral cells revealed that mitral cell odor responses in M71 transgenic mice greatly resembled the responses observed in wild-type mice. Indeed, the fraction of responsive mitral cells and odor-evoked changes in firing rates were indistinguishable from controls. Calcium imaging and whole cell recordings further indicated that much of this normalization of odor-evoked activity is achieved through inhibition by periglomerular interneurons. Finally, we found that M71 transgenic mice exhibit spontaneous sniff adaptation in response to acetophenone exposure, suggesting that while they consistently fail to discriminate acetophenone from air in a go/no-go operant conditioning tasks they are indeed able to detect the presence of acetophenone. Together, our data reveal that odor-evoked patterns of glomerular activity can be substantially transformed by olfactory bulb neural circuits, to extract meaningful odor information from massively degraded sensory input and point towards a key role of glomerular inhibition."

This response was indistinguishable from controls (p=0.12, t-test), and similarly displayed a significant decrease in sniff frequencies upon re-exposure (p=1.7 x 10<sup>\u20138</sup>, paired t-test, n = 29 mouse-odor pairs, n = 8 mice, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Surprisingly, similar results were obtained for acetophenone presentations: both control and M71 transgenic mice displayed initial high frequency responses (control: mean = 3.0\u2009Hz, SD = 1.6\u2009Hz; M71 transgenic: mean = 3.8\u2009Hz, SD = 1.9\u2009Hz, p=0.38, t-test), and reductions in response frequencies during the second and third acetophenone presentation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F and G</a>, right panels)."

We therefore next asked how perturbed glomerular inputs in M71 transgenic mice are transformed into olfactory bulb outputs. We developed an in vivo imaging approach that permits the visualization of odor-evoked responses specifically in mitral cells, the main output neurons of the olfactory bulb. We used a replication-deficient recombinant rabies virus to drive the expression of the calcium-sensitive indicator of neural activity GCaMP3 (RV\u0394G-4GCaMP3) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tian et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wickersham et al., 2010</a>) in large populations of mitral cells. We made multiple injections of this rabies-GCaMP3 virus into the olfactory cortex underneath the lateral olfactory tract (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). After injections, mice were allowed to recover for 5\u20137 days before two-photon imaging of neural activity was performed under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Because this modified rabies virus lacks the gene encoding its viral glycoprotein, it is unable to spread transsynaptically, thereby restricting the expression of GCaMP3 to neurons directly infected via their axonal terminations (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wickersham et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">2010</a>). However, because the virus retains its ability to replicate in infected cells, we found that infected cells began exhibit clear signs of toxicity after 12 days (not shown). We therefore performed all imaging experiments within 5\u20137 days after virus injections."

In wild-type mice, we found that odorants at low concentrations (0.01%, or 1/10,000 vol./vol. dilution) typically evoked sparse, spatially distributed patterns of activity in ~15% of mitral cells (mean = 14.5%, standard deviation (SD) = 11.2%; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F and H</a>).

Interestingly, our test set of odorants includes several odorants that have been reported to not activate the M71 receptor. Ethyl acetate or eugenol, for example, do not activate M71-expressing olfactory sensory neurons at all concentrations tested (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bozza et al., 2002</a>), and do not elicit detectable glomerular activity in M71 transgenic mice (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fleischmann et al., 2008</a>). However, we found that all test odorants including ethyl acetate and eugenol evoked mitral cell responses. Moreover, the fractions of odor-responsive neurons were indistinguishable from wild-type littermate controls (mixed-effect ANOVA (genotype x odorants), F<sub>(13, 242)</sub> = 0.58, p=0.87, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H and I</a>).

Approximately half of the neurons (46.1%) did not respond to any of the 13 odorants in the stimulus set used to probe selectivity, while the majority of odor-responsive neurons (43.9% of all neurons) displayed significant increases in fluorescence to only 1\u20135 odor stimuli. A small subpopulation (10.0%) of mitral cells were more broadly tuned. Moreover, the majority of stimulus-evoked mitral cell response magnitudes were small, with peak \u0394F/F values below 35%, although we could observe a small number of large stimulus-evoked responses with \u0394F/F values of up to 200% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Finally, the fluorescence levels of most odor-responsive neurons (&gt;80%) returned to baseline within 8 s after response onset (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In M71 transgenic mice, mitral cells tended to be more broadly tuned (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>), but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Chi-squared test: \u03c72 = 17.7, p=0.17). For acetophenone and the 12 other odorants, the distribution of the response magnitudes of mitral cell was shifted towards smaller peak \u0394F/F values, with a particularly large reduction in the number of strongly responding neurons (i.e. those reaching \u0394F/F values of greater than 50%; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, median \u0394F/F: control: 0.36, M71 transgenic: 0.32; mean \u0394F/F: control: 0.47, M71 transgenic: 0.38, Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: D<sub>4116,1639</sub> = 0.12, p&lt;0.01, and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In M71 transgenic mice, the fraction of neurons responding on all 4 out of 4 repeat presentations of the same odorant was reduced from 14% in controls to 2.9% in M71 transgenic mice. Furthermore, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients of the activity patterns after odor onset. We found that for acetophenone and the 12 other odorants, the mean correlation of response patterns to individual exposures of the same odorant was reduced in M71 transgenic mice compared to controls (controls: mean across 13 odorants = 0.75 \u00b1 0.11; M71: mean = 0.25 \u00b1 0.17, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and F</a>)."

Such amplification may explain how M71 transgenic mice can still detect and discriminate most odorants. However, an increase in the trial-to-trial variability of mitral cell responses will degrade the fidelity of the odor representation, and may underlie the impairments in odor discrimination that M71 transgenic mice exhibit with more challenging assays."

We next sought to obtain more detailed information about the network mechanisms underlying the normalization of odor-evoked mitral cell activity, using whole cell recordings from mitral and tufted cells (MTCs) in awake head-fixed mice. First, we characterized the intrinsic properties of MTCs, including resting membrane potentials, input resistance, membrane time constant tau, and baseline firing rates. These biophysical properties of MTCs were, on average, similar in M71 transgenic mice (n = 6 cells from 6 mice) and controls (n = 7 cells from 5 mice, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013G</a>). Interestingly, however, we observed that MTCs in M71 transgenic mice appeared to be less heterogeneous compared to wild-type, in particular for baseline firing rate (Control: 5.8 \u00b1 6.2\u2009Hz, M71: 3.0 \u00b1 1.0\u2009Hz, p=0.003 Bartlett test) and theta modulation strength (Control: 0.4 \u00b1 0.4 mV, M71: 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 mV, p=0.01 Bartlett test), which might reflect their more homogeneous olfactory inputs and thus developmental history (<a href=\"#bib2\">Angelo et al., 2012</a>)."

We measured evoked MTC response profiles to a one-second pulse of 4 non-acetophenone stimuli (3 monomolecular odorants - hexanone, heptanal, ethyl acetate - and a mixture of isoamyl acetate, 2-nonanone and cyclohexanol, at a concentration of 1% of absolute vapor pressure). As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cury and Uchida, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kollo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Shusterman et al., 2011</a>), MTC activity in these awake, head-fixed mice was modulated by odor in a diverse manner, with prominent excitatory as well as inhibitory responses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,J and K</a>). On average, odor exposure resulted in a moderate hyperpolarization (mean \u0394Vm = -1.8 mV, SD = 2.1 mV, 27 cell/odor pairs), and a small increase in the firing rate (mean \u0394 firing rate = 2.2\u2009Hz, SD = 13.3\u2009Hz, 27 cell/odor pairs). Consistent with our imaging data, we found that overall firing rate distributions to the same 4 stimuli were more compact in M71 transgenic mice; mean changes in firing rate were indistinguishable from controls (mean \u0394 firing rate<sub>M71</sub> = 0.75\u2009Hz, SD = 2.2\u2009Hz, 20 cell/odor pairs, p=0.67, Rank-sum, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4M</a>), yet the fraction of excitatory responses was similar (control: 32%, M71: 25%). Odor presentation generally resulted in both excitatory and inhibitory responses, with only a small change in the average membrane potential (mean \u0394Vm = 0.10 mV, SD = 1.1mV, 20 cell/odor pairs; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I,J and M</a>). However, both excitatory and inhibitory responses were generally weaker (\u0394|Vm|<sub>M71</sub> = 0.5+[-0.3 0.8] mV, \u0394|Vm|<sub>cntrl</sub> = 1.3+[-0.6 2.5] mV, p=0.006, Wilcoxon rank sum; \u0394 |firing rate|<sub>M71</sub> = 0.8+[-0.3 1.6]yy Hz, \u0394|firing rate|<sub>cntrl</sub> = 6.0+[-3.0 6.2] Hz, p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum, median +[lower quartile, upper quartile]), and strong excitatory responses notably absent in M71 transgenic mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4M</a>). Most prominently, inhibitory responses were substantially reduced compared to littermate controls (p=0.003, Rank-sum, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L</a>)."

Therefore, we performed two-photon imaging experiments in mice engineered to selectively express GCaMP3 in PG cells. Selectivity was achieved by injecting Cre-dependent AAV (AAV5.hSynap.Flex.GCaMP3.WPRE.SV40) into the olfactory bulbs of either M71 transgenic mice that also carried a <i>Gad2-Cre</i> transgene (<a href=\"#bib50\">Taniguchi et al., 2011</a>), or littermate controls expressing the <i>Gad2-Cre</i> transgene only. AAV injections resulted in the labeling of large numbers of GABA-positive interneurons in the glomerular layer, with extensive processes extending into individual glomeruli (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K\u2013M</a>). In control mice, only a fraction of PG cells displayed responses to either acetophenone or ethyl acetate (acetophenone: 10.9%; ethyl acetate: 12.1%, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5O</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). The magnitudes of these odor-evoked responses were small, with more than 80% of peak \u2206F/F values below 10% (data not shown). Unlike mitral cells, where responses in M71 transgenic mice and their littermate controls were often indistinguishable, odor responses were strikingly different in PG cells. Exposure of M71 transgenic mice to acetophenone, even at the lowest concentration (0.01% vol./vol.), resulted in pervasive, strong and persistent activity in over 48% of PG cells, significantly higher than in littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5P</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>, Rank-sum test n<sub>co</sub> = 10, n<sub>M71 transgenic</sub> = 9, U = 83, p&lt;0.01). Furthermore, the magnitude and duration of acetophenone-evoked PG cell activity was significantly increased in M71 transgenic mice compared to controls (data not shown). In contrast to these robust and pervasive responses to acetophenone, ethyl acetate elicited PG cell activity in only a small population of neurons (&lt;10%, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5P</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>), and response magnitudes were consistently below 10% peak \u2206F/F values (data not shown). These responses tended to be fewer and with smaller \u2206F/F values than those observed in littermate controls, but this observation did not reach statistical significance. Taken together, electrophysiology and imaging experiments indicate that pervasive and strong glomerular excitation is balanced by similarly pervasive and strong periglomerular inhibition to normalize olfactory bulb mitral cell output."

Furthermore, although response magnitudes sharply increased with increasing acetophenone concentrations, response durations were reduced (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The striking sensitivity to acetophenone concentration was not observed for ethyl acetate.

We therefore next asked how increasing odorant concentration affects the activity of PG cells in both M71 transgenic mice and controls. While PG cells were already quite responsive to low acetophenone concentrations in M71 transgenic mice, increasing acetophenone concentrations dramatically increased PG cell activity in these mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F and H</a>): 0.1% activated over 85% (mean 85.1% \u00b1 13%) of PG cells in M71 transgenic mice compared to only 10.8% ( \u00b1 6.6%) observed in controls.

Although ethyl acetate has previously been reported not to activate the M71 receptor (<a href=\"#bib61\">Bozza et al., 2002</a>), these data suggest that ethyl acetate may in fact be a weak M71 receptor agonist that activates M71 at high concentrations. This speculation is supported by the observation that while odorants activate segregated, glomerulus-specific clusters of PG cells in wild-type mice, PG cell responses to both acetophenone and ethyl acetate were pervasive and not restricted to individual glomeruli in M71 transgenic mice, consistent with the pervasive glomerular innervation by M71-expressing sensory inputs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E and F</a>)."

The olfactory bulb of M71 transgenic mice thus provides a powerful model system with which to explore neural mechanisms of signal normalization.

In contrast, M71 transgenic mice failed to discriminate the M71 receptor ligand acetophenone from air. We have replicated these initial findings with an independent cohort of mice. In total, 15 M71 transgenic mice were tested in this task, and all 15 mice failed to reach a correct lick ratio of above 75%. Why do M71 transgenic mice fail this test? We previously hypothesized that pervasive glomerular activation elicits inhibition at multiple stations along the olfactory pathway, which could entirely suppress acetopheone-evoked neural activity. However, our calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings do not support this hypothesis. Instead, we observe that acetophenone-evoked suprathreshold mitral cell activity in M71 transgenic mice is surprisingly similar to that observed in wild-type mice: the fraction of acetophenone-responsive neurons, and acetophenone-induced changes in mitral cell firing rates are indistinguishable from controls. Furthermore, alterations in mitral cell response magnitude, duration, and changes in the dynamic range of mitral cell responses do not provide a simple explanation for the observed behavioral deficit. The most striking acetophenone-specific effect we observe is a massive amplification of theta oscillations. A single one second puff of acetophenone elicits strong theta oscillations that last for at least 20 s. The behavioral consequences of this oscillatory activity are unknown, but it is possible that these prolonged network perturbations interfere with the discrimination of acetophenone from clean air in the go/no go operant conditioning task. Alternatively, we cannot exclude that our clean air stimulus contains contaminating traces of acetophenone, and that acetophenone at extremely low concentrations is sufficient to elicit neural activity in M71 transgenic mice that makes it indistinguishable from the acetophenone odor puff. This would suggest that the observed behavioral deficit results from the inability of M71 transgenic mice to discriminate between different acetophenone concentrations, rather than from the inability to detect it. Finally, strong oscillatory network activity may precede an epileptic state (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nguyen and Ryba, 2012</a>), which could obstruct odor discrimination."

Spontaneous sniff adaptation does not require that mice accurately discriminate between successive presentations of two different stimuli. Therefore, while acetophenone-induced network perturbations may interfere with odor discrimination, mice may be able to detect and recognize acetophenone as a previously encountered stimulus in this test. Additionally, the heightened level of anxiety in M71 transgenic mice (<a href=\"#bib21\">Glinka et al., 2012</a>) might amplify sniff responses to novel stimuli including to non-olfactory components of the stimulus. Another important difference between the two behavioral tasks is that unlike spontaneous sniff adaptation, operant conditioning requires extensive training. It is possible that training, which is performed with non-acetophenone odorants, may shape the processing of odor-evoked activity, and that such plastic changes may underlie the task dependency of the behavioral deficit."

We now show that PG cells are pervasively and robustly activated by acetophenone in M71 transgenic mice. Furthermore, mitral cell patch-clamp recordings reveal that acetophenone evokes strong and prolonged phasic inhibition in M71 transgenic mitral cells, reminiscent of PGC-mediated feedforward inhibition described previously (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fukunaga et al., 2014</a>). This feedforward inhibitory activity is likely to provide an effective mechanism to transform pervasive glomerular activity into sparse mitral cell responses."

Candidates include superficial dopaminergic interneurons that have previously been suggested to mediate signal normalization (<a href=\"#bib3\">Banerjee et al., 2015</a>), as well as parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, which reside in the external plexiform layer and receive direct input from widely distributed mitral cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kato et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Miyamichi et al., 2013</a>). In addition, deep layer granule cells, which form dendrodendritic synapses on the lateral dendrites of nearby mitral cells can modulate neighboring mitral cell output by means of powerful feedback and feedforward inhibition (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jahr and Nicoll, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Margrie et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rall et al., 1966</a>). Altogether, these interglomerular inhibitory networks can normalize response magnitudes across a range of input intensities and enhance contrast between patterns of odor-evoked glomerular activity, and feedforward inhibition from primary onto secondary olfactory neurons represents an olfactory circuit function that appears highly conserved in evolution (<a href=\"#bib41\">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zhu et al., 2013</a>). However, we found that increasing acetophenone concentration dramatically increased the fraction of responsive mitral cells, resulting in dense neural odor representations similar to the dense patterns of acetophenone-evoked glomerular activity. Thus, at high acetophenone concentrations, excitation may override inhibition, exposing the limits of olfactory bulb circuit mechanisms to normalize glomerular activity."

Strikingly, the fraction of responsive neurons to a panel of 13 odorants (including acetophenone) was not significantly different from what was observed in littermate controls. While individual ligand-receptor interactions remain incompletely characterized, calcium imaging experiments suggest that most odorants do not activate M71-expressing olfactory sensory neurons, or do so only at high odorant concentrations (<a href=\"#bib61\">Bozza et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fleischmann et al., 2008</a>).

                                "text": "Whole cell recordings of mitral cells reveal that odorants commonly evoke phasic inhibition in wild-type mice (as described previously e.g <a href=\"#bib18\">Fukunaga et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Margrie et al., 2001</a>), and that this inhibition in response to odorants other than acetophenone is significantly reduced in M71 transgenic mice. This result suggests that olfactory bulb inputs ordinarily evoke non-specific inhibition that can only be overcome by strong and specific input. Such inhibition coupled with specific excitation can increase signal-to-noise ratios and enhance contrast (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cleland and Sethupathy, 2006</a>). By contrast, in the M71 transgenic mice, non-acetophenone inputs are too weak to recruit inhibition, allowing these weak inputs to evoke responses. This may at least partially explain why responses are prolonged, and why trial-to-trial variability of responses is increased in these animals. However, weak signals may also be actively amplified. For example, electrical coupling electrical coupling between mitral cells connected to the same glomerulus, and self-excitation of intraglomerular mitral cell assemblies, can further facilitate the detection of weak odor signals (<a href=\"#bib10\">Christie et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Isaacson, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Margrie et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Murphy et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schoppa and Westbrook, 2001</a>). However, a multi-synaptic pathway involving olfactory bulb tufted cells may also directly amplify the output of mitral cells in response to weak inputs (<a href=\"#bib14\">De Saint Jan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fukunaga et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gire et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Najac et al., 2011</a>). These different neural mechanisms are likely to cooperate in improving the ability of M71 transgenic mice to detect odorants that do not activate the M71 receptor. Interestingly, however, we observed that the patterns of mitral cell activity are more variable across multiple odorant presentations. The fraction of mitral cells responding reliably to the same stimulus is significantly reduced in M71 transgenic mice, and the variation of the average fraction of responsive neurons for a given trial is increased. Odorants will therefore activate more variable ensembles of cells. One important source of variability in neural responses to sensory stimuli is noise, and neural circuit mechanisms to reduce variability due to noise often rely on averaging signals from neurons carrying redundant information (<a href=\"#bib15\">Faisal et al., 2008</a>). Large numbers of sensory neurons expressing the same odorant receptor and converging onto only two glomeruli in the olfactory bulb provide a striking example of this principle. In M71 transgenic mice, the number of sensory neurons expressing a given odorant receptor are strongly reduced, thus limiting the power of averaging to reduce variability. We speculate that this increased variability of a neural odor representation will affect the accuracy of odor discrimination in M71 transgenic mice, a model consistent with the olfactory discrimination deficits observed for difficult to discriminate odorant mixtures."

Motion artifacts were first corrected by using a subpixel translational-based discrete Fourier analysis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guizar-Sicairos and Fienup, 2008</a>). ROIs were then manually drawn on an average image of the imaging site, and the pixel gray values averaged in each ROI were used to estimate the fluorescence of single cells at each time frame. For each trial, the change in fluorescence (\u2206<i>F/F<sub>0</sub></i>)was calculated as <i>(F-F<sub>0</sub></i>) <i>/ F<sub>0</sub>,</i> where <i>F<sub>0</sub></i> is the median value between seconds 2 and 6 of the pre-odor period. We estimated the baseline fluctuation at a given trial as the standard deviation (SD) of \u2206<i>F/F<sub>0</sub> </i>during the baseline period. Odor responses were assessed over a 10 s period following odor onset. A cell was deemed responsive if it exceeded response threshold (3.2 x SD for mitral cells, false positive rate (FPR) = 1.3%, 3.4 x SD for periglomerular cells, FPR = 3.8%) during at least 3 frames in this period. Using a more stringent response criterion for mitral cells (3.8 x SD) yielded reduced numbers of odor-responsive neurons, but did not change the relative distributions of odor-responsive neurons between M71 transgenic mice and controls, or mitral cell response variability (data not shown). The percent of responding neurons to each stimulus was calculated as the average number of active neurons across 4 trials. To construct the odor spot maps and to calculate the tuning curves, only cells that responded at least 2 out of the 4 trials were included. To build the cross-correlation matrix of the patterns of activity we combined \u2206<i>F/F<sub>0</sub> </i>responses of all mitral cells, averaged over the 4 s following odor onset into a single mitral cell x odor trial matrix. We then calculated the cross-trial correlations of the patterns of mitral cell activity."

Before performing parametric statistical tests (ANOVA), homogeneity of variance within datasets was tested by computing the maximum variance ratio <i>Max</i>(<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>)/<i>Min</i>(<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>) between groups. Homogeneity of variance was assumed if the maximum variance ratio was below 4. To explore the variability of mitral cell odor representation density across genotypes and odorants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H\u2013I</a>), we used a mixed-effect ANOVA with genotype and odor as fixed-effect categorical factors, and imaging site as a random effect variable to account for repeated measure of the same imaging site in the course of an experiment. To quantify the differences in the concentration dependence of neural responses across stimuli and genotypes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), we regressed the number of responsive neurons on stimulus intensity, and calculated the difference in linear change between stimuli (\u2206LC = LC<sub>acetophenone</sub> \u2013 LC<sub>ethyl acetate</sub>) as the difference between their regression slopes."

This is a very intriguing explanation with profound consequences. It means that monoclonal nose animals lack the ability to discriminate concentrations of the ligand, and their concentration dynamic range is very low. This result may inform us about concentration/intensity coding in the olfactory system. I wonder why the authors stopped short. Why in their imaging studies would they not lower acetophenone concentration to test this hypothesis? It would be ideal if they can present odors in their imaging studies using exactly the same odor delivery system used in the behavioral setup. The Knosys olfactometer may indeed suffer from a contamination problem, because it has C-flex tubing in the odor pathway."

This work is a follow up to the first work describing this mouse (Fleischmann, 2008). The current paper attempts to answer a few interesting problems formulated in the first paper: 1) How, despite the drastic decrease in the number of OSNs expressing a given OR type (except M71), do these mice show no behavioral deficits in discriminating or detecting non-M71 ligands? 2) Why, despite overexpression of the M71 receptor, are these mice unable to detect an M71 ligand (acetophenone)?

The current paper reports an obvious M/T cell response to acetophenone, and a strong concentration dependence to this ligand. How, then, do authors explain the inability of monoclonal mice to detect M71 ligands? The arguments about postsynaptic inhibition do not reconcile with their current findings, because the measured calcium activity in mitral cells is a putative proxy of spiking output. No matter the differences in bulbar circuitry and processing, if a somewhat normal signal is sent to cortex, the animal should be able to detect it."

Thus, the balance between excitation and inhibition in these two states is likely very different (see also Cazakoff, Nat.Neuro., 2014). Since it is unclear exactly how the balance differs in these M71 mice, it is hard to predict if M/T cell activity would transition in a similar way to control mice between anesthetized and awake states, or how well the anesthetized activity reflects the potential difference in network function that could emerge in the awake-state activity of these mice. Given that the current technology allows recording in awake mice, I do not see any reason why authors did not address the question more directly.

A previous study (Fleischmann et al., 2008) demonstrated that the expression of endogenous ORs was greatly reduced in M71 transgenic mice. Despite this alteration, these mice were able to detect and discriminate a variety of odors, with noticeable deficits in discriminating very similar odors. They also showed that these mice failed to detect acetophenone, an M71 receptor ligand, despite the fact that acetophenone activates the vast majority of ORNs and OB glomeruli. The neural basis of these behavioral deficits remains to be clarified."

The authors demonstrate that the fractions of mitral cells activated by an odor were very similar between wild-type and M71 transgenic mice (~15% ) despite the great reduction in endogenous OR expressions in M71 transgenic mice. Interestingly, the trail-to-trial variability of odor responses was greater in M71 transgenic mice. The authors then measured the subthreshold membrane voltage dynamics with whole cell recording and showed that odor stimulation often evoked hyperpolarization in M71 transgenic mice, consistent with a role of inhibitory mechanisms in normalization. These results demonstrate that massive normalization of odor-evoked activities occurs at the level of the OB and the increased trial-to-trial variability may underlie the behavioral deficits. The latter idea is consistent with the idea that massive convergence of ORN axons increases the reliability of odor responses."

Individual experiments consisted of 200-300 trials, and experiments typically lasted for ~30 minutes, characterized by periods of intense odor sampling that were occasionally interrupted by periods of exploration of the conditioning chamber. Our previous comments about inter-trail intervals were indeed misleading. We have now detailed the structure of each behavioral trial in the Methods section. In brief, initiated by a light beam break by the animal, each trial starts with a 0.5 second preparation period to ensure rapid odor presentation, followed by a two second odor presentation. Mild suction ensures clearing of odors after each trial, but the system was not designed for rapid clearing. After a variable time interval chosen by the animal the next trial commences. In order to specifically compare the inter-trial interval with the post-odor exposure theta oscillations we have now analyzed inter-trial intervals for 7 animals. We find that the median time from the end of one odor presentation (closing of the odor valve) to the beginning of the next is 6.3 \u00b1 0.5 seconds (25 percentile: 6 \u00b1 0 sec, 75 percentile 8.7 \u00b1 2.6 sec, mean and SD across 7 animals, 300 trials each). This is substantially lower than the prolonged theta oscillations we observe during our head-fixed in vivo whole cell recordings following acetophenone presentation, which last for at least 20 seconds. We did not attempt to change inter-trial intervals in this task, as enforced, longer inter-trial intervals can substantially alter odor discrimination learning (Bodyak and Slotnick, 1999; Walker and O\u2019Connell, 1986). Controlled variation of the inter-trial interval simultaneous with physiological recordings probing subthreshold theta oscillations is indeed a possible next step in probing the hypothesis of how acetophenone perception might be perturbed, but would go substantially beyond the scope of this manuscript. To clarify these points, we have added a detailed description of the task in the Methods section of the revised manuscript."

Sensory neurons expressing the same odorant receptor, and converging onto two glomeruli in the olfactory bulb provide a striking example of this principle. In M71 transgenic mice, the number of sensory neurons expressing a given odorant receptor are strongly reduced, thus limiting the power of averaging to reduce variability."

We find that theta coupling in response to acetophenone exposure is indeed massively amplified in M71 transgenic mice after acetophenone exposure. During baseline conditions, theta coupling of MTCs was slightly weaker in M71 transgenic mice. There was no significant difference in the preferred phase of M71 transgenic or control MTCs. During odor exposure there was no significant difference in phase preference. With respect to inhibitory responses it is difficult to ascertain preferred phase as inhibition tends to be strong, prolonged and seemingly unmodulated. We do now show the average acetophenone response for each cell recorded in the awake animal (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). One potential explanation would be that odor-evoked inhibition might clamp the membrane potential to the Cl<sup>-</sup>reversal potential at the site of the synaptic input, thus masking any modulation. At this point this is pure speculation and we thus refrain from further discussions in the revised manuscript."

The current paper reports an obvious M/T cell response to acetophenone, and a strong concentration dependence to this ligand. How, then, do authors explain the inability of monoclonal mice to detect M71 ligands? The arguments about postsynaptic inhibition do not reconcile with their current findings, because the measured calcium activity in mitral cells is a putative proxy of spiking output. No matter the differences in bulbar circuitry and processing, if a somewhat normal signal is sent to cortex, the animal should be able to detect it.</i>"

The result that an M71 monoclonal mouse cannot detect M71 ligands is very important, yet quite controversial.

Given the current result that the mitral cells in M71 mice respond more or less normally to acetophenone, I harbor doubts that these mice would not be able to detect the odor.

We have also performed a new and different type of behavioral experiment that assesses the ability of M71 transgenic mice to detect odors. In the somewhat cruder, spontaneous task (sniff modulation in response to novel odor exposure), we find that M71 transgenic animals respond to both general odors and to acetophenone. This finding indicates that the previous interpretation that M71 transgenic mice are generally and completely unable to detect acetophenone was indeed an over-simplification."

The finding that phasic odor responses to be acetophenone and other odorants are similar in wild-type and M71 transgenic mice are consistent in both awake and anesthetized mice. However, these new experiments also revealed a striking amplification of acetophenone-evoked theta oscillations. We hypothesize that these long-lasting (tens of seconds) and massively increased oscillatory network perturbations may impair the discrimination of acetophenone from air in the go/no go operant conditioning task. Therefore, these findings, together with the new result that sniffing is altered in response to acetophenone, require a more sophisticated explanation for our original findings that M71 transgenic mice do not discriminate between acetophenone and air in the go/no go operant conditioning task. We are grateful to the reviewer for this demanding and ultimately important critique."

It has been shown that not only is the resting state of M/T cells quite different in awake and anesthetized states (Rinberg, 2006, but also see Kollo, 2014), but also that M/T cell odor responses become sparser in the awake state (Kato, 2012). Thus, the balance between excitation and inhibition in these two states is likely very different (see also Cazakoff, Nat.Neuro.,2014). Since it is unclear exactly how the balance differs in these M71 mice, it is hard to predict if M/T cell activity would transition in a similar way to control mice between anesthetized and awake states, or how well the anesthetized activity reflects the potential difference in network function that could emerge in the awake-state activity of these mice.</i>"

However, we recognize that a more detailed characterization of mitral cell responses in awake M71 transgenic mice can provide important new mechanistic insight intoolfactory bulb signal normalization. Therefore, to directly test for potential differences between awake and anaesthetized recordings we have performed whole cell recordings in awake mice to complement our imaging data in anesthetized mice.

After reading this paper it is very hard to make definite conclusions about the mechanisms for such normalization. The authors proposed a role for PG cells in this process. It is one plausible explanation, but I am not sure how much this paper adds to revealing the mechanisms of signal normalization. In my opinion, there are two basic approaches. First, that the proposed mouse model can help us understand basic mechanisms of olfactory processing. The data presented does not convince me that this is the case. Second, a new model by itself presents an interesting phenomenon, and it is worth understanding how, with such unnatural structure of receptor input, the system can behave in an almost \"normal\" way.
