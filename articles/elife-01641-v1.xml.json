At present nothing is known about the function of this poorly characterised compartment. In this study, we report that the nucleolar protein Ki-67 is required for the assembly of the perichromosomal compartment in human cells. Ki-67 is a cell-cycle regulated protein phosphatase 1-binding protein that is involved in phospho-regulation of the nucleolar protein B23/nucleophosmin. Following siRNA depletion of Ki-67, NIFK, B23, nucleolin, and four novel chromosome periphery proteins all fail to associate with the periphery of human chromosomes. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) images suggest a near-complete loss of the entire perichromosomal compartment. Mitotic chromosome condensation and intrinsic structure appear normal in the absence of the perichromosomal compartment but significant differences in nucleolar reassembly and nuclear organisation are observed in post-mitotic cells."

At present nothing is known about the function of this poorly characterised compartment. In this study, we report that the nucleolar protein Ki-67 is required for the assembly of the perichromosomal compartment in human cells. Ki-67 is a cell-cycle regulated protein phosphatase 1-binding protein that is involved in phospho-regulation of the nucleolar protein B23/nucleophosmin. Following siRNA depletion of Ki-67, NIFK, B23, nucleolin, and four novel chromosome periphery proteins all fail to associate with the periphery of human chromosomes. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) images suggest a near-complete loss of the entire perichromosomal compartment. Mitotic chromosome condensation and intrinsic structure appear normal in the absence of the perichromosomal compartment but significant differences in nucleolar reassembly and nuclear organisation are observed in post-mitotic cells."

The exact structure of those chromosomes changes as the cell moves through the different stages of the cell division cycle. During the stage called mitosis, where the DNA of a cell (which has previously been duplicated) is shared into two daughter cells, the chromosomes become tightly packed structures that can be readily moved through the cytoplasm. Since the late nineteenth century, it has been known that a layer of proteins, called the perichromosomal layer, coats the condensed chromosomes. However, virtually nothing was known about the role this layer performs."

Again, however, little is known about what Ki-67 actually does."

This allowed Booth et al. to investigate the role of the perichromosomal layer as well. When the chromosomes first go through mitosis without a perichromosomal layer, no changes to the shape or the behaviour of the chromosomes are seen. However, the new nuclei are smaller than normal and their contents are arranged differently. This causes problems with the ability of daughter cells to synthesise protein building blocks and leads to an increased rate of spontaneous cell death when daughter cells try to undergo the next mitosis. Further research is needed to understand why this happens."

Ki-67 is also a major organiser of the perichromosomal layer, possibly acting as an interaction platform. Remarkably, Ki-67 depletion prevents all nucleolar proteins tested from accumulating around the chromosomes in mitosis. Thus, chromosomes in cells depleted of Ki-67 appear to lack most or all of their perichromosomal layer. This enabled us to gain insights into the function of this enigmatic chromosomal compartment. Interestingly, loss of the perichromosomal layer does not detectibly compromise the condensed morphology or intrinsic structure of mitotic chromosomes but does result in significant changes in nucleolar morphology and nuclear organization in the following interphase."

A previous report described the successful depletion of Ki-67 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Vanneste et al., 2009</a>). However, the target sequence recognised by the published siRNA lies within a repeated stretch and rescue experiments to validate the phenotype were not reported.

Both new siRNAs yielded comparable phenotypes and we used siRNA 5 (Ki5) for the depletion experiments presented below.

Thus, the pathway of nucleolar reassembly exhibits a remarkable degree of plasticity. Furthermore, the segregation of at least one major nucleolar component is noticeably more variable following Ki-67 depletion, suggesting that association with the chromosomes may contribute to the accurate and efficient segregation of the ribosome synthesis machinery at cell division."

During nuclear envelope reassembly, vesicle association and fusion on the chromosomal surface to make the double membrane bilayer precede the assembly of functional nuclear pores (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kutay and Hetzer, 2008</a>). Thus, during mitotic exit, there is a brief period during which the chromatin is insulated from contact with the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Their association with the chromosomal surface as the nuclear envelope is laid down at the end of mitosis, means that the ribosomal components of the perichromosomal compartment are inside the membrane barrier when it forms. This early access to NOR chromatin and the high protein concentration within small decondensing G1 nuclei may be critical factors in NOR reactivation, thereby \u2018jump starting\u2019 nucleolar reassembly. Indeed, it has previously been shown that assembly of prenucleolar bodies, an early step in nucleolar reassembly takes place on the chromosome periphery (<a href=\"#bib54\">Savino et al., 2001</a>). In the absence of Ki-67 and of the chromosomal periphery there will be a period of time during mitotic exit when nucleolar components in the cytoplasm are denied access to the chromosomes, and this could then explain the decreased efficiency of nucleolar reassembly."

Thus, Ki-67 has an important role in determining the behaviour of many nucleolar components during mitosis. Interestingly, this method of segregating nucleolar components means that nucleolar reassembly can begin immediately after CDK activity declines and before the re-establishment of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport during mitotic exit. Ki-67 is a PP1-interacting protein, however the biological role of this activity remains elusive and indeed the protein could execute this function during another phase of the cell cycle rather than mitosis. How the various activities of Ki-67 combine to determine the nucleolar morphology in proliferating cells and whether the perichromosomal layer has a subtle role in chromosome dynamics during mitosis or nuclear reformation remain to be determined in future studies."

Ki-67 is the subject of numerous papers in which it is used as a marker for actively dividing cells, but there is very little known about its molecular function. Here the authors demonstrate the Ki-67 is a direct PP1 binding protein in vitro, and that Ki-67 is required for proper PP1 targeting to chromosomes and the dephosphorylation of at least some substrates. In addition, the authors demonstrate that Ki-67 is required for the localization of peripheral chromatin proteins (PERPs) and nucleolar organization. This appears to be a separate function for Ki-67 where it acts apparently as a scaffold rather than a PP1-targeing protein. In general, I found this to be an interesting paper that provides a useful contribution, but there are a number of things that could be done to improve this paper."

The authors report that Ki-67 is also a PP1 interacting protein but that the cell cycle distribution of RepoMan and Ki-67 are distinct and do not influence each other, suggesting the two proteins control distinct cellular processes. The authors confirm that Ki-67 is located in the nucleolus in interphase and to the perichromosomal compartment in anaphase. Notably, the localization of six other proteins, including cPERP-B, cPERP-C, cPERP-D, cPERP-F, B23 and NIFK (some of which were identified in a previous proteomic analysis of mitotic chromosomes), to the periphery of anaphase chromosomes is severely reduced when the expression of Ki-67 is repressed by RNAi. They suggest from this that Ki-67 may be a scaffold for establishment of the perichromosomal compartment. These results are novel, interesting and believable."

Rather disarmingly, they also admit to being disappointed with the lack of effect of Ki-67 knockdown on mitotic chromosome structure. Thirdly, they observe no effect on recruitment of other perichromosomal proteins to the periphery of anaphase chromosomes when the association of PP1 to Ki-67 is abolished. Unfortunately, this reviewer is not persuaded by the data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> that Ki-67 controls the phosphorylation status of nucleolin or nucleophosmin/B23.

If this is the case live cell imaging of multiple cells may reveal asymmetric inheritance of nucleolar material. Alternatively, since Ki-67 is exported from nuclei in quiescent cells perhaps Ki-67 is important for nucleolar function on re-entry to the cell cycle? In the absence of such insight this reviewer is unfortunately left somewhat underwhelmed."

The negative results showing, amongst other things, that Ki-67 does <i>not</i> influence the phosphorylation status of nucleolin have now been removed from the manuscript. Hopefully in the very much slimmed-down description of the role of Ki-67 in phosphoregulation, the ambiguities have been removed."

In the absence of Ki-67, nucleolin segregation does become slightly more random.

We demonstrate clearly that in the absence of Ki-67 (therefore the absence of most or all of the perichromosomal compartment) NOR reactivation is less efficient during mitotic exit and subsequent ribosomal transcription is reduced. This leads us to propose the model stated on the first page above, that having nucleolar components INSIDE the reforming nuclear envelope, before nuclear pores reassemble and the envelope becomes transport-competent allows those components to act \u2013 either early, or in a more concentrated environment, or at an appropriate cell cycle stage \u2013 more efficiently and promote more efficient NOR reactivation."
