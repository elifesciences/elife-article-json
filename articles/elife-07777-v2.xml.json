They are abundant in eukaryotic proteomes and are often associated with human diseases, but their biological functions have been elusive to study. In this study, we report the identification of a tin(IV) oxochloride-derived cluster that binds an evolutionarily conserved IDR within the metazoan TFIID transcription complex. Binding arrests an isomerization of promoter-bound TFIID that is required for the engagement of Pol II during the first (de novo) round of transcription initiation. However, the specific chemical probe does not affect reinitiation, which requires the re-entry of Pol II, thus, mechanistically distinguishing these two modes of transcription initiation. This work also suggests a new avenue for targeting the elusive IDRs by harnessing certain features of metal-based complexes for mechanistic studies, and for the development of novel pharmaceutical interventions."

They are abundant in eukaryotic proteomes and are often associated with human diseases, but their biological functions have been elusive to study. In this study, we report the identification of a tin(IV) oxochloride-derived cluster that binds an evolutionarily conserved IDR within the metazoan TFIID transcription complex. Binding arrests an isomerization of promoter-bound TFIID that is required for the engagement of Pol II during the first (de novo) round of transcription initiation. However, the specific chemical probe does not affect reinitiation, which requires the re-entry of Pol II, thus, mechanistically distinguishing these two modes of transcription initiation. This work also suggests a new avenue for targeting the elusive IDRs by harnessing certain features of metal-based complexes for mechanistic studies, and for the development of novel pharmaceutical interventions."

Consequently, many studies of TFIID have used purified proteins in artificial systems where it is possible to examine particular aspects of TFIID activity in depth."

By virtue of their structural malleability and propensity to interact with multiple-binding partners, these peptide stretches of \u223c30 or more amino acid residues have become increasingly recognized for their pivotal and prevalent role in cellular functions including many implicated in human disease pathogenesis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Babu et al., 2011</a>).

However, conceptually, this feature of IDRs may be suitable for interactions with the hydrophilic and periodic metal\u2013oxygen backbones found in a group of metal clusters known as polyoxometalates (POMs). POMs, primarily composed of transition metals and oxygen, have been previously reported to exhibit potent biological activities (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rhule et al., 1998</a>), although these activities are rather promiscuous due to POMs' limited structural diversity, large size, and dependence on charge-based interactions in protein binding (<a href=\"#bib19\">Judd et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Geng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Narasimhan et al., 2011</a>).

Of all the GTFs, TFIID is the one with intrinsic DNA sequence specificity and is responsible for nucleating the assembly of a preinitiation complex (PIC) at core promoters (<a href=\"#bib43\">Roeder, 1996</a>). TFIID-promoter binding, which can be further stabilized by TFIIA, creates a platform for TFIIB loading, which in turn allows the engagement of TFIIF and Pol II. TFIIE and TFIIH are the last to join the PIC, after which promoter melting and RNA synthesis can occur. After Pol II leaves the promoter during the initial (de novo) round of transcription, a reinitiation scaffold containing TFIID has been proposed to remain on the DNA template and facilitate subsequent rounds of transcription (reinitiation) in reconstituted mammalian systems (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hawley and Roeder, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zawel et al., 1995</a>)."

TBP recognizes and binds to the TATA box, while TAF1 and TAF2 recognize the Initiator element (Inr), and the TAF6-TAF9 module recognizes the downstream core promoter element (DPE) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Juven-Gershon and Kadonaga, 2010</a>). It is generally accepted that higher TFIID-promoter affinity leads to more robust transcription, and indeed it is thought that a primary role of sequence-specific activators is to recruit TFIID to promoters (<a href=\"#bib43\">Roeder, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Albright and Tjian, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Matangkasombut et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Juven-Gershon et al., 2006</a>). However, transcription initiation is a dynamic process and the release of at least a portion of the TFIID-promoter DNA contacts has been shown to be a critical step for productive initiation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yakovchuk et al., 2010</a>). In addition, TFIID may assume diverse structures and its recognition of core promoter elements can be modulated by activators and post translational modifications (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Juven-Gershon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cianfrocco et al., 2013</a>). These distinct functional states of TFIID and their transitions are likely critical for gene-specific transcription regulation, but they are difficult to probe by conventional biochemistry and genetic analysis."

By virtue of its specificity for interfering with the first round of transcription initiation, this metal cluster compound serves as a useful tool for studying the role of TFIID in both transcription initiation and reinitiation. This non-POM metal cluster revealed a novel mode of interaction with a low-complexity protein domain, demonstrating the feasibility of using metal-based compounds to selectively target IDRs."

In this assay, the GST fusion protein was immobilized on a functionalized surface and an aqueous solution prepared with pure tin(IV) oxochloride chemicals was injected. We detected binding and dissociation of the chemical to the fusion protein upon chemical injection and buffer washing, respectively. In addition, we found that the binding is sensitive to imidazole and to pH values of \u22645.8, consistent with an essential role of histidine residues, which are protonated at lower pH and therefore incapable of coordinate bonding with the inhibitor.

In addition, the inhibitor-targeted dTAF2 IDRs are rich in lysine residues that may non-specifically interact with negatively charged DNA backbone. We therefore examined whether GST fusions containing dTAF2 (1125\u20131221) or its sub-regions could retain DNA in a GST-pull down assay using DNA fragments corresponding to different regions of the promoter used in the transcription assay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We found that indeed, this fragment of TAF2 can directly interact with DNA, primarily through the poly (K) and poly (KH) motifs, and more weakly through the adjacent poly (KD/E) motif. In addition, this interaction seems to be independent of the DNA sequence, which is not surprising given the low complexity of this region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This suggests that this newly identified DNA interaction surface of TAF2 may be quite distinct from the previously reported Inr-selective DNA-binding activity of TAF2 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Verrijzer et al., 1994</a>)."

We found the holo-TFIID protects an extended area of the promoter DNA from DNase I digestion, as previously reported on the super core promoter (SCP1) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Juven-Gershon et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The signatures of this footprint include the protection of some hypersensitive sites (such as the band A at the upstream edge of the Inr element, and many bands covered by the bracket), and the exposure of new hypersensitive sites (such as band B at the downstream edge of the Inr element) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, lane 1 and 2). The TATA box is not protected because the engagement of TBP in the context of holo-TFIID complex at this promoter requires TFIIA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cianfrocco et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, the inhibitor and its analog specifically enhanced features corresponding to promoter DNA binding by TFIID (lanes 3\u20138) (exemplified by the enhanced protection of band A and sensitization of band B, quantified by image analysis). This observed enhancement was subtle but highly reproducible using the various commercially supplied compounds and likely to be a specific consequence because a non-specific inhibitor picked up in our initial screen clearly reduced rather than enhanced TFIID binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> lanes 9\u201310 and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

It is important to note that the inhibitor doesn't block TFIID-promoter binding, thus, it is likely to affect some downstream events. Individual TFIID-promoter contacts are likely dynamic, and a rate-limiting isomerization of TFIID could influence the transition from an initially bound Pol II to a productively engaged Pol II in the assembly of a functional PIC (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yakovchuk et al., 2010</a>).

This suggests that a TFIID-TFIIB-DNA sub-complex is likely the most susceptible substrate for inhibition, while the presence of other core promoter factors may facilitate the progression of PIC assembly and reduce the time interval of this vulnerable stage. Addition of TFIIF partially alleviated the inhibition (comparing lanes 6 and 8), suggesting that TFIIF may play a necessary but insufficient role in driving TFIID into an inhibitor-resistant state. Upon further addition of Pol II to the assembly, the system became resistant to the inhibitor to a level comparable to that of preformed PICs (lanes 10 and 14). In contrast to the essential role of TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF, and Pol II (the same set of factors required for Pol II engagement) in forming the minimal PIC intermediate resistant to inhibition, adding TFIIE and TFIIH had no effect on inhibition (comparing lane 10, 12, and 14), even though these two factors are required for robust transcription. Very similar results were observed when individual protein factors were left out one by one from GTF set 1 as an alternative strategy to arrest PIC assembly at specific stages (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> lanes 11\u201324 for the pure tin(IV) oxochloride compound; and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for the original lead compound ChemDiv 7241-4207). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the step most sensitive to inhibition involves the initial binding of Pol II to a DNA-TFIID complex that must then transition into a conformation compatible with productive Pol II engagement. Importantly, after Pol II engagement takes place during de novo PIC assembly, the system becomes resistant to the inhibitor."

The addition of TFIIB enhanced protection over the upstream region (from the TATA box to the Inr), and this protection became further enhanced by the addition of TFIIF (lanes 3 and 4), consistent with the synergy between TBP and TFIIB binding to promoter DNA (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tsai and Sigler, 2000</a>), and the stabilization of TFIIB binding by TFIIF (<a href=\"#bib31\">Luse, 2012</a>). Interestingly, we observed significant changes in the footprint pattern upon the addition of Pol II (lane 5). These changes include (i) the exposure of some hypersensitive sites protected by the initial TFIID binding (such as position \u223c+16, and the sites flanking the DPE), suggesting the release or unmasking of some DNA from the bound TFIID; (ii) emergence of new hypersensitive sites (such as position \u223c+14), suggesting structural changes in the DNA trajectory itself caused by Pol II binding; (iii) reduction of the hypersensitive site induced by TFIID binding at the edge of the Inr, consistent with the release of some DNA from TFIID and/or the association of Pol II; and (iv) a strong and extended protection covering the upstream of the TATA box (\u223c\u221237) to the Inr, consistent with the engagement of Pol II and other PIC components with this region of the promoter.

This sub-complex gives a weak footprint (that is expected to be more sensitive to perturbation than the footprint generated by optimal levels of TFIID) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, lanes 2 and 3). Despite using suboptimal levels of TFIID, no significant change in the footprint protection was observed upon inhibitor treatment (lane 4). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the inhibitor likely acts at a stage after TFIID and TFIIB binding. Because Pol II and TFIIF are known to be tightly associated to each other physically and functionally (<a href=\"#bib43\">Roeder, 1996</a>) and they both rescue PIC assembly from the inhibition (TFIIF partially and Pol II completely), we next added them together to the reaction and observed, as expected, the characteristic footprint changes associated with Pol II engagement (lane5). Importantly, in the presence of the inhibitor, the Pol II-induced footprint changes over the TATA box, the Inr, and in between were largely abolished, while the protection downstream of the Inr were partially altered, suggesting that the full engagement of Pol II is significantly disrupted by the tin compound along a major portion of the promoter (lane 6). In control experiments where the inhibitor was added after TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF, and Pol II, it had almost no detectable effect on the footprint corresponding to the post-isomerization state of the partial PIC (lanes 7 and 8). This is consistent with the transcription profile where addition of Pol II renders the system resistant to the inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). To better focus on the changes over the downstream promoter region, we also performed the experiment under conditions that generate optimal TFIID footprints. We verified that the inhibitor only partially compromised the downstream changes associated with Pol II engagement, although it almost completely blocked the changes covering the TATA and Inr elements (lanes 9\u201314). The changes of DNase I protection patterns observed in the downstream region suggest that the inhibitor may still allow Pol II to partially interact with this part of the promoter (either directly or indirectly via TFIID), and that a simple complete exclusion of Pol II from accessing promoter DNA is unlikely to be the primary inhibition mechanism. These results are consistent with the possibility that the inhibitor directly stabilizes TFIID\u2013Inr interactions and prevents the progression of the conformational isomerization. We conclude that transcription inhibition is most likely a consequence of incomplete Pol II engagement due to arrested TFIID isomerization. Once PIC assembly passes through this Pol II-dependent isomerization stage, the inhibitor apparently can no longer interfere with transcription."

Although TFIID is thought to be part of the reinitiation scaffold, if and how the retained TFIID might differ from complexes assembled during de novo initiation has remained unclear. In addition, using <i>Drosophila</i> embryo nuclear extracts and a dual template assay system, Kadonaga has demonstrated that each round of transcription requires complete assembly and disassembly of the PIC. Thus, at least in vitro, under certain transcription conditions, there is no commitment of any limiting transcription factor to the initial template to form a pre-licensed reinitiation scaffold (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kadonaga, 1990</a>). This observed difference is likely a result of various regulatory protein factors and/or promoter elements present in different reaction systems. We therefore decided to further investigate whether TFIID is committed to an initiating DNA template and becomes pre-licensed for reinitiation in our completely defined highly purified human Pol II transcription system."

These findings suggest that commitment of the limiting factor (including TFIID) to DNA 1 during de novo transcription initiation mostly persists through multiple rounds of reinitiation.

In this assay, a sequence containing no G residues was inserted after the adenovirus major late promoter (for this \u2018G-less\u2019 cassette-based assay, the SCP1 is not suitable because it contains multiple G residues in the initially transcribed sequence). Transcription in the absence of GTP (but in the presence of all the other three required nucleoside triphosphates) would cause the first Pol II molecule to stall at the position of the first G-residue after the G-less cassette, and to stall the second and third Pol II molecules at positions further upstream. Using alpha-<sup>32</sup>P labeled CTP as a substrate, this system will allow the first Pol II molecule to synthesize a nascent transcript corresponding to the length of the G-less cassette, followed by progressively shorter transcripts that result from reinitiation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Szentirmay and Sawadogo, 1994</a>). Using our highly purified transcription factors, we observed just such a ladder of nascent transcripts of expected sizes as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib47\">Szentirmay and Sawadogo, 1994</a>). Importantly, addition of 0.02% Sarkosyl just before the NTP substrates only weakly diminished the synthesis of the longest transcript, but almost completely abolished the shorter ones (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), mirroring the effect of 0.02% Sarkosyl in mildly affecting preassembled PIC for the first round of transcription while completely blocking reinitiation (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Thus, the longest transcript likely represents the products of de novo (first round) transcription, while the short ones represent reinitiation products in our system. Quantification of the longest transcription confirmed robust (ninefold) inhibition of de novo transcription initiation when the chemical was added before PIC assembly, and this inhibition became highly attenuated (twofold) when the chemical was added after PIC assembly. When we normalized the signal from each round of transcription in each reaction to the first round of transcription, we found the ratio of the second and third transcripts to the first one (\u2018reinitiation rate\u2019) to be highly consistent across all the samples. In particular, inhibitor added after PIC assembly (but before NTPs allow the first Pol II to escape the promoter) had no effect on reinitiation rate, confirming that the chance of a reinitiation scaffold to support more transcription events (after the first Pol II escapes the promoter) is not sensitive to the inhibitor."

Therefore, the inhibitor-resistance caused by Pol II engagement during de novo PIC assembly is unlikely simple steric masking, but rather a result of rearrangement of TFIID\u2013DNA interactions. This difference in TFIID conformation and functional state between de novo initiation and reinitiation also suggests how TFIID and the pre-licensed scaffold might bypass certain stages of de novo PIC assembly to facilitate reinitiation.

We propose a critical isomerization step during de novo PIC assembly involving a TFIID conformational change (i.e., release of at least part of the promoter DNA, illustrated by the change in the shape of TFIID) to allow entry and engagement of Pol II. Once Pol II becomes engaged and further stabilized by other factors (TFIIE, TFIIF, etc) transcription can proceed.

The TAF2 IDR targeted by the tin(IV) oxochloride-derived inhibitor turned out to be a newly identified TAF2 DNA-binding domain that likely becomes structured upon DNA binding, perhaps reminiscent of basic domains in the leucine zipper family of activators (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shuman et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Weiss et al., 1990</a>). On the other hand, the TAF2 IDR domain, with its low-complexity sequences, does not appear to be responsible for the sequence-specific recognition of the Inr element by TAF2 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Verrijzer et al., 1994</a>). Instead, this IDR domain apparently binds DNA non-specifically, consistent with our finding that template DNA bearing Inr mutations still responded to the inhibitor in transcription reactions."

In this model, the inhibitor-stabilized TAF2 IDR is an impediment to full Pol II engagement. We postulate that this Pol II-dependent isomerization is a multi-step process that engages an extended region of the promoter DNA that gets blocked at the Inr by the inhibitor. This model is consistent with our DNase I footprinting results. Alternatively, if the TAF2 IDR is an active helper for Pol II to overcome the barrier posed by other bound factors (like TFIID) to interact with the upstream DNA and the associated protein factors (such as TFIIB), interference of TAF2 IDR function could also lead to a partially impeded Pol II engagement. This is reasonable because IDRs are known to interact with multiple partners with diverse functions (<a href=\"#bib51\">Uversky, 2013</a>). Based on the different levels of sensitivity to inhibition, Pol II engagement can be dissected into at least two sections: the release of the downstream elements from TFIID (which can partially occur in the presence of the inhibitor) and the binding and reorganization of the TATA-Inr region (which is almost completely inhibited). Further study using the TFIID inhibitor and advanced techniques, such as single-molecule imaging suitable to capture fast dynamics in complex biochemical reactions (<a href=\"#bib41\">Revyakin et al., 2012</a>), could be useful to reveal additional mechanistic aspects of this elusive part of PIC assembly."

Interestingly, although generally considered a coactivator (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albright and Tjian, 2000</a>), TFIID has also been found at promoters of silenced/inactive genes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Breiling et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tatarakis et al., 2008</a>) and may even function as a \u2018checkpoint\u2019 during activation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Marr et al., 2006</a>). It remains to be seen whether the TAF2 IDR is required for such reported checkpoint functions. Our findings regarding the TAF2 IDR are reminiscent of regulatory functions mediated by the AT-hook domains of TAF1. Much like TAF2, the TAF1 subunit of TFIID also plays critical roles in core promoter recognition (<a href=\"#bib22\">Juven-Gershon and Kadonaga, 2010</a>). The two AT-hook DNA-binding domains of TAF1 preferentially associate with the narrower minor grooves associated with AT-rich sequences (<a href=\"#bib36\">Metcalf and Wassarman, 2006</a>). Most interestingly, AT-hooks are also intrinsically disordered (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2006</a>), and their phosphorylation by casein kinase II was proposed to regulate core promoter selectivity by altering the conformation of TFIID (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>). Therefore, the various intrinsically disordered DNA-binding domains of TFIID subunits may underscore previously underappreciated versatility of this complex in recognizing core promoter elements and responding to activators."

Reinitiation is likely an important aspect of transcription regulation in vivo, possibly related to \u2018bursting\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Raj et al., 2006</a>), but its mechanism is poorly understood. We found that although the engagement of Pol II during de novo PIC assembly is sensitive to the inhibitor, re-entry of Pol II during reinitiation is inhibitor resistant. The mechanism behind this difference is linked to the different functional states of TFIID and the TAF2 IDR targeted by the inhibitor. As a reagent for mechanistic studies, the tin(IV) oxochloride cluster is distinct from Sarkosyl, which has traditionally been used to study reinitiation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hawley and Roeder, 1987</a>). Sarkosyl in fact does not discriminate between initiation and reinitiation, even in cases where specialized reinitiation scaffolds are involved. Proper targeting of reinitiation by Sarkosyl relies on the timing of addition (after de novo PIC assembly but before reinitiation in synchronized reactions). In addition, the actual target of Sarkosyl has remained largely a mystery. In contrast, the tin(IV) oxochloride cluster identified here has a clear and specific target and obviates the necessity for timed addition by directly blocking initiation while leaving reinitiation and on-going transcription intact."

For example, the role of activators and/or specific promoters in retaining TFIID, Mot1 proteins in removing and recycling TFIID, and other limiting factors, etc has all been proposed to influence these two potential mechanistically distinct pathways to achieve multiple rounds of transcription. It is also possible that the reported discrepancies can be a reflection of the complexity and diversity of regulatory factors assembled as part of the core transcription machinery responsible for promoter recognition in different organisms and possibly even distinct cell types."

Interestingly, the canonical TFIID complex has been reported in several cases to be dispensable for ongoing transcription in terminally differentiated, non-dividing cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cler et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Goodrich and Tjian, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Muller et al., 2010</a>). Accordingly, these cells are likely to be resistant to perturbation by chemicals that specifically target the canonical TFIID complex, particularly the function of TFIID in de novo transcription initiation. In contrast, biological processes stringently dependent on de novo transcription initiation, such as the onset of viral transcription after infection or re-establishment of mRNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cancer cells, should be more sensitive to this kind of chemical perturbation. Therefore, with specific functions required for de novo transcription initiation but not reinitiation, the canonical TFIID complex has the potential to be even more selective than TFIIH, another component of the Pol II core transcription machinery that was recently found to be a promising target for cancer therapy development (<a href=\"#bib49\">Titov et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chipumuro et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kwiatkowski et al., 2014</a>)."

The critical role of histidine coordination demonstrated here is a direct expansion of a recent report on a nickel/cobalt substitution in potentiating POM compounds to prevent amyloid \u03b2 peptide aggregation involved in Alzheimer's diseases (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gao et al., 2014</a>). With locally enriched charged residues, the TAF2 IDR binding to the metal complex may involve electrostatic interactions as well. Histidine coordination and salt bridges by themselves are unlikely to be sufficient for high-specificity interactions. However, the specific biochemical activity and the synergy with DNA (but not heparin) binding suggest a reasonable level of structural selectivity. This is consistent with our finding that a tris-Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid derivative capable of coordinating multiple histidines (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lata et al., 2005</a>) can bind TAF2 in the context of human TFIID but fails to inhibit transcription under relevant concentrations (data not shown). We speculate this selectivity may be partially ascribed to the periodic nature of the rigid metal\u2013oxygen backbone of our tin compound, which can at least discriminate secondary structures (\u03b1 helices, \u03b2 sheets, and random coils) of the protein target (presenting the repetitive residues with distinct periodicity). This discrimination may be sufficient to shift the equilibrium between the functional states of the dynamic IDR, as exemplified recently by a phosphorylation-induced \u03b2-barrel formation and its regulation of a disorder-to-helix transition within an IDR of the 4E-BP2 translational regulator (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bah et al., 2015</a>). We thus propose that certain features of metal complexes can be harnessed in the design of new reagents targeting polar and repetitive IDRs that have largely evaded intervention by traditional organic small-molecule modulators."

Evidence is presented for the interaction of the compound with a low complexity region of TAF2 that unexpectedly stabilizes binding of TFIID to promoter DNA. Using a defined set of initiation factors and Pol II, with and without Sarkosyl, the authors conclude that the compound does not inhibit reinitiation. The data are of high quality and demonstrate that the metal complex does inhibit transcription in vitro, likely through TFIID, however the claim that reinitiation is not affected will require further proof. The manuscript is well written, but could be improved by eliminating unnecessary data."

The tin compound inhibits transcription to the same relative extent in assays with or without Sarkosyl addition (7B). My main concern is the assumption that the difference between minus and plus Sarkosyl is due to reinitiation. The original Hawley paper used it to block subsequent initiation in a crude system and the mechanism was assumed to be disruption of protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interactions which Sarkosyl does. The fully formed PIC is fairly resistant to low concentrations, but subsequent PIC formation is blocked. The amount of Sarkosyl is critical since it will disrupt preformed PICs. This is especially important in a defined system that does not have high protein concentrations like the extracts did in the original Hawley paper. Why was it added after NTPs? Initiation takes only seconds. How long after NTPs were added was the Sarkosyl added? Why were the reactions carried out for 30 minutes? To make statements about reinitiation (repeated use of a single promoter), an alternative method is needed to demonstrate that reinitiation is actually occurring under the conditions and factor concentrations used. One way to do this is to use a G-less cassette with continuous labeling and direct analysis of transcripts as was done in Szertirmay and Sawadogo (1994). Reinitiation is indicated in such an experiment by seeing transcripts of different lengths corresponding to Pol II that has stacked up behind the first polymerase initiated. Without such evidence I am not convinced that reinitiation is occurring and this impacts the important interpretation of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>. Also the conclusion that reinitiation is not affected is hard to reconcile with the idea that the compound stabilizes TFIID binding in an inactive conformation. After initiation the compound would be expected to bind and inhibit the next round. If reinitiation is occurring in the absence of Sarkosyl what factor is responsible for resistance to the inhibitor?"

These tin-based compounds apparently interact with an intrinsically disordered region of the TAF2 subunit of TFIID. If the inhibitors act before TFIID is stably associated with the template, transcription is very significantly reduced. The authors show that the footprint of TFIID on a TATA-containing promoter is altered near the INR in the presence of the inhibitor. They also show in a Sarkosyl-based reinitiation assay that the effects of the inhibitor appear to be confined to the initial round of transcription, with subsequent rounds unaffected. The authors conclude that this inhibitor affects the initial productive engagement of the polymerase with the template, but not the case of polymerase entering additional rounds of transcription."

For example, the initial downstream expansion of the transcription bubble might be blocked. Fortunately this would be easy to test \u2013 does the inhibitor have any effect in an abortive initiation assay? If the initial few bonds can be made in the presence of the inhibitor, how long can the transcripts become?

I don't think this interpretation is justified \u2013 TFIID binding as judged by overall protection in the footprint doesn't change significantly with the inhibitor. What has changed is the alignment of (presumably) TAF2 with the INR, which in turn changed the template accessibility to DNase over this region. The localized nature of these changes provokes questions specifically about transcription bubble formation, initiation and clearance, as I just noted. It would have been useful to see if these changes persisted even when IIB and IIF were present, since these factors partially rescue transcription from the effect of the inhibitor. Another point about the footprints \u2013 as best as I can tell the TATA box is not protected. Can the authors comment on that?"

I am afraid I am skeptical of the assay. The key assumption is that Sarkosyl at 0.1% prevents the assembly of new PICs and thus confines transcription to a single round. It is not widely appreciated, but Pol II PICs do not all initiate immediately once NTPs are added. I know from my own experience that, for example, transcription for 5 min with cold NTPs still allows robust new synthesis of labeled RNAs by Pol II PICs when labeled precursors are spiked in during the next 5 min. Critically, in these experiments the RNAs were very short (&lt;20 nt), so by definition the observed transcription in the second labeling period could not have come from promoters which were already transcribed once in the initial 5 min. I suspect that the extra transcription seen when Sarkosyl is left out simply represents the failure of the otherwise late-starting complexes to initiate. This isn't simply based on my own experience \u2013 the Yudkovsky et al. paper cited here shows that TFIID-based complexes isomerize slowly to transcriptional competence, with a half time of 10-15 min. Does Sarkosyl affect that isomerization?"

The authors assume (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, for example) that Pol II is recruited to the inhibited complex but somehow cannot function. However, they don't actually demonstrate that Pol II is recruited \u2013 couldn't the inhibitor work to change TFIID's conformation so that Pol II cannot join the nascent PIC? I think an argument in this direction can be made based on the right-most panel of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. It would seem that the downstream (+16 through about +40) footprint changes characteristic of the complete complex still appear when Pol II is added after the inhibitor, but the TATA to +1 changes are reduced. This seems, at least to me, to suggest that Pol II is present in the inhibited complex even though it cannot access the transcription start site.\u201d"

Basically 0.02% Sarkosyl added at the beginning is sufficient to inhibit both initiation and reinitiation; a pre-assembled preinitiation complex (PIC) may be resistant to 0.02% Sarkosyl, but completely inhibited by 0.04% Sarkosyl (this is about 2 fold more sensitive than their 1987 paper, which might reflect some differences in our system and/or experimental procedures). On the other hand, after the addition of ribonucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrates that allow productive elongation, the system becomes resistant to a broad range of Sarkosyl, up to 0.64% as tested."

On the other hand, when added immediately after NTPs, a broad range of Sarkosyl concentrations from 0.04% to at least 0.64%, give the same result of preventing reinitiation. Therefore we chose to add 0.1% Sarkosyl within 30 seconds after NTPs addition to restrict transcription to a single round."
