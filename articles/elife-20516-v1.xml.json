In line with this result, Zhang et al. identified lymphatic endothelial cells as the source of CCL20 \u2013 the chemokine that is sensed by CCR6 (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). During an infection by <i>S. aureus</i> bacteria, innate-like T lymphocytes that lack CCR6 produced less interleukin-17 than normal. This occurred because the bulk of these cells were localized too far away to respond to interleukin 1\u03b2 signals from the macrophages that line the sinuses. Thus to work effectively, innate-like T cells need to be placed close to the CD169-expressing macrophages that line the sinus."

There, the innate-like T lymphocytes can sense interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) that the macrophages that line the sinus (blue cells) release\u00a0locally in response to the activation of the inflammasome. Together with interleukin-23 (not shown), IL-1\u03b2 activates the CCR6+ innate-like lymphocytes, which in turn produce interleukin-17 (IL-17).
