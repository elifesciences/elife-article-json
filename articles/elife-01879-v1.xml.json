In addition to these proteins, specific vacuole lipids are required for efficient fusion in vivo and with the purified organelle. Reconstitution of vacuole fusion with all purified components reveals that high SNARE levels can mask the requirement for a complex mixture of vacuole lipids. At lower, more physiological SNARE levels, neutral lipids with small headgroups that tend to form non-bilayer structures (phosphatidylethanolamine, diacylglycerol, and ergosterol) are essential. Membranes without these three lipids can dock and complete <i>trans</i>-SNARE pairing but cannot rearrange their lipids for fusion."

Fusion is guided and catalyzed by families of proteins which are conserved from yeast to humans: Rab family GTPases serve as membrane-identity master switches (<a href=\"#bib13\">Grosshans et al., 2006</a>), binding large multisubunit effector complexes which catalyze tethering, the first step of specific membrane association. Membranes bear SNARE proteins (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</a>), with characteristic heptad repeats with a central arginyl (R-SNARE) or glutamyl (Q-SNARE) residue (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fasshauer et al., 1998</a>) and membrane anchor domains. SNAREs can bind (snare) each other, either as <i>cis</i>-SNARE complexes in which each SNARE is anchored to the same membrane or as <i>trans</i>-SNARE complexes in which SNAREs are anchored to two different apposed membranes. When the SNAREs of each membrane have been liberated from <i>cis</i>-SNARE complexes by the SNARE complex disassembly system of Sec18p (NSF), Sec17p (\u03b1-SNAP), and ATP (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mayer et al., 1996</a>), and the membranes have been tightly apposed through tethering, SNAREs can assemble into <i>trans</i>-SNARE complexes. <i>Trans</i>-SNARE complex assembly is a prerequisite for the bilayer rearrangements of fusion."

An initial screen for altered vacuole morphology (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wada et al., 1992</a>), the <i>vam</i> phenotype, identified the vacuole-specific Rab (now termed Ypt7p), the vacuole-specific SNAREs, and subunits of the Rab effector complex (termed HOPS, for homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting; <a href=\"#bib35\">Seals et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wurmser et al., 2000</a>). However, later genomic screens for fragmented vacuole morphology in strains with defined nonessential gene deletions suggested that sterol and phosphoinositides were also required for fusion (<a href=\"#bib36\">Seeley et al., 2002</a>). With a quantitative, colorimetric assay of the fusion of purified vacuoles, biochemical studies confirmed vital roles for phosphoinositides (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mayer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cheever et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Seeley et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fratti et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mima and Wickner, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Xu and Wickner, 2010</a>), diacylglycerol (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jun et al., 2004</a>), and ergosterol (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kato and Wickner, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Seeley et al., 2002</a>). It was found that each of these lipids co-localized with the Rab, Rab-effector, and SNAREs in the fusion microdomain of docked vacuoles, and that the localization of these lipids to this microdomain is interdependent with localization of the fusion proteins (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fratti et al., 2004</a>)."

Reconstituted proteoliposomes (RPLs) were prepared with a recombinant prenylated Rab (Ypt7p) and with the four vacuolar SNAREs (Nyv1p, Vam3p, Vti1p, and Vam7p, which are the vacuolar R, Qa, Qb, and Qc SNAREs; <a href=\"#bib9\">Fasshauer et al., 1998</a>). RPLs were formed from an octylglucoside mixed-micellar solution of these proteins and vacuolar lipids during lengthy dialysis in the cold, then isolated by flotation. One set of proteoliposomes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) bears Marina Blue-linked phosphatidylethanolamine as a lipidic marker and entrapped Cy5-derivatized streptavidin as a lumenal marker, while a complementary set of RPLs bears the lipidic marker NBD-PE and lumenally entrapped biotinylated phycoerythrin. Fusion reactions are performed in the presence of a large excess of external, nonfluorescent streptavidin to bind any biotinylated R-phycoerythrin that may be released from the proteoliposomes by lysis. Upon addition of purified HOPS, Sec17p, Sec18p, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>:ATP, fusion allows the biotin-R-phycoerythrin to bind to the Cy5-streptavidin within the lumen of fused vesicles while remaining inaccessible to the external, nonfluorescent streptavidin. This is readily assayed by the ensuing F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Cy5 and R-phycoerythrin. Fusion is also reflected in the quenching of the fluorescence of Marina Blue-PE as it is mixed in the same bilayer with NBD-PE. The rate and extent of fusion are governed by the proteoliposomal lipid composition and by the molar ratio of SNARE proteins to lipid. Proteoliposomes of a vacuolar mixed lipid (VML) composition, based on the established composition of the isolated organelle (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schneiter et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zinser et al., 1991</a>), bearing SNAREs at a 1:1000 molar ratio to lipids (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, left, filled circles) or at a 1:3000 ratio (filled squares) undergo rapid fusion. At a 1:9000 SNARE:lipid ratio, the fusion of VML proteoliposomes (filled triangles) slows to the rate seen for PC/PS proteoliposomes at a 1:1000 ratio (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, right, open circles). Fusion is hardly detectable for PC/PS proteoliposomes with SNAREs at a 1:9000 molar ratio to lipids (open triangles)."

Tethering allows a striking enrichment of fusion proteins and lipids in a microdomain, followed by <i>trans</i>-SNARE complex assembly. This is followed by rearrangements of the lipid bilayers resulting in membrane fusion and the attendant mixing of lumenal compartments. To determine the stage(s) that require the nonbilayer-prone-lipids, paired sets of proteoliposomes were prepared with VML lipids, Ypt7p, and either the R-SNARE Nyv1p or the Q-SNAREs Vam3p (Qa) and Vti1p (Qb). These proteoliposomes readily fuse when incubated with HOPS and Vam7p (Qc-SNARE); Sec17p and Sec18p stimulate but are not required (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zick and Wickner, 2013</a>) and were not present in these assays. A second set of proteoliposomes was prepared in parallel, but lacking PE, DAG, and ERG. There was no fusion in the absence of the three small headgroup lipids (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

The Rab Ypt7p directly binds the oligomeric tethering complex HOPS (<a href=\"#bib35\">Seals et al., 2000</a>). This interaction is necessary (<a href=\"#bib38\">Stroupe et al., 2006</a>) for tethering of vacuolar membranes, and is sufficient for tethering of proteoliposomes of a simple lipid composition such as PC/PS (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hickey and Wickner, 2010</a>). It was therefore not surprising that comparable levels of trans-SNARE complex formed in the presence or absence of small headgroup lipids (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), but the need for these particular lipids for the ensuing fusion was unexpected. It has been suggested that fusion occurs immediately and inexorably upon <i>trans</i>-SNARE complex formation. However, several studies have suggested that fusion is more complex. Brunger and colleagues. (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kyoung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Diao et al., 2012</a>) have shown long kinetic separation between formation of some trans-SNARE complexes and complete membrane fusion for certain spontaneous fusion events (for example, in the absence of calcium) and in the presence of both synaptotagmin and complexin; upon calcium triggering, a burst of fast fusion events were then observed. During yeast vacuole fusion, lumenal compartment mixing occurs many minutes after docking is complete (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mayer et al., 1996</a>). Furthermore, when a single SNARE (Vam7p) is withheld from tethered vacuole clusters, the addition of this SNARE triggers rapid and synchronized completion of docking, as assayed by the acquisition of resistance to added antibody to Ypt7p or to Vam3p, but lumenal compartment mixing only occurs far more slowly (<a href=\"#bib28\">Merz and Wickner, 2004</a>). Lipid ligands have been reported to block fusion after docking (<a href=\"#bib6\">Collins and Wickner, 2007</a>). We now exploit the fully reconstituted vacuole fusion reaction to show that small-headgroup lipids that are prone to non-bilayer structures play a critical role in the progression of docked, <i>trans</i>-SNARE paired proteoliposomes to fusion."

Though the effects of disrupting PE biosynthesis in yeast are likely too pleiotropic to allow examination of its effects on vacuole fusion in vivo, PE is required for the fusion of mitotic Golgi membranes (<a href=\"#bib32\">P\u00e9cheur et al., 2002</a>). In model studies with recombinant neuronal SNAREs, PE increased the probability of docking but reduced fusion (<a href=\"#bib8\">Domanska et al., 2010</a>). These studies differed from those reported here in several crucial aspects: (i) The use of planar lipid bilayers vs highly curved proteoliposomes, (ii) neuronal vs vacuolar SNAREs, (iii) the absence of a Rab and Rab-effector docking system or of an SM protein in the neuronal reconstitution, and (iv) the composition and complexity of lipids in these reconstitutions. Yeast mutants defective in sterol biosynthesis have multiple small vacuoles, indicative of deficient organelle fusion (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kato and Wickner, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Seeley et al., 2002</a>). The fusion of vacuoles purified from wild-type yeast is blocked by extraction of ergosterol by \u03b2-methylcyclodestrin, and fusion can be restored by incubation with cholesterol-loaded \u03b2-methylcyclodestrin (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kato and Wickner, 2001</a>). Cholesterol has also been shown to be required for Semliki Forest virus fusion (<a href=\"#bib44\">White and Helenius, 1980</a>). Diacylglycerol is also directly implicated in vacuole fusion. Whereas a wild-type yeast strain has one or a few vacuoles, deletion of <i>PLC1</i>, encoding a phospholipase C which generates diacylglycerol, causes striking vacuole fragmentation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jun et al., 2004</a>), a hallmark of defective fusion (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wada et al., 1992</a>). The cell-free fusion of purified vacuoles is blocked by recombinant C1b domain, a DAG ligand, and is stimulated by added Plc1p (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jun et al., 2004</a>). Both ergosterol and diacylglycerol become enriched at the fusion microdomain of docked vacuoles, and this enrichment is sensitive to fusion-protein ligands such as Sec17p and an Fab fragment of affinity-purified antibody to Vam3p (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fratti et al., 2004</a>). Our current studies with proteoliposomes bearing pure vacuolar proteins and lipids is thus well-grounded in in vivo genetics and morphology as well as cell-free studies of the fusion of the purified organelle."

It is currently unclear whether the sole function of <i>trans</i>-SNARE pairs is a close and stable tethering of apposed lipid bilayers, or whether they exert a deforming force on each bilayer to provide the energy for lipid spatial rearrangement into non-bilayer intermediates. Prenyl-anchored SNAREs can support the fusion of vacuoles (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jun et al., 2007</a>) and of chemically-defined proteoliposomes (<a href=\"#bib48\">Xu et al., 2011</a>), and this has recently been extended to synaptic fusion in mice (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). These findings suggest that fusion does not depend on force exerted through the formation of continuous \u03b1-helices, extending from the SNARE bundle across two <i>trans</i>-membrane anchor domains (<a href=\"#bib27\">McNew et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2007</a>). How might high levels of <i>trans</i>-SNARE pairs be able to bypass the need for the three small headgroup lipids? A single <i>trans</i>-SNARE pair may bring flat or spherical membrane bilayers into close apposition without distorting their bilayer structure, while multiple <i>trans</i>-SNARE pairs may draw membranes together over a wider region, creating a bend in the bilayer at the edge of the zone of apposition, as seen for docked vacuoles (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fratti et al., 2004</a>).

The lipid rearrangements for fusion can be driven by the membrane bend induced by multiple <i>trans</i>-SNARE pairs, or can occur by the accretion of fusogenic, noncylindrical lipids when the SNARE concentrations are at low, physiological levels. The Vam7p SNARE N-domain has a Phox-homology motif, and has been shown to associate with the <i>trans</i>-apposed bilayer (<a href=\"#bib47\">Xu and Wickner, 2010</a>) by its affinity for PI(3)P and acidic lipids (<a href=\"#bib22a\">Lee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20a\">Karunakaran and Wickner, 2013</a>) and to bear apolar residues which may insert into the bilayer (<a href=\"#bib22a\">Lee et al., 2006</a>). Similarly, neuronal SNARE-associated synaptotagmin is triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to insert into the lipid bilayer (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chapman and Davis, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhang et al., 1998</a>) and may function to bridge bilayers (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ara\u00e7 et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Xue et al., 2008</a>). These may also cause bilayer distortions that facilitate fusion; there has not been a direct test of whether nonbilayer-forming lipids contribute to the extraordinary rates of calcium-triggered neuronal fusion. Further tests of this model may rely on the development of assays to measure the physical strain within bilayers, and of reconstituted reactions fusing large proteoliposomes where lipid- and protein-enriched microdomains can be visualized as readily as with vacuoles."

Samples were incubated at 100\u00b0C until dry (approximately 1 hr). Perchloric acid (300 \u00b5l of a 70% vol/vol solution) was added. Samples were incubated at 180\u2013200\u00b0C for 1 hr with occasional vortexing, then cooled to room temperature. Ammonium molybdate (1.5 ml of a 0.4% wt/vol solution) and ascorbic acid (225 \u00b5l of a 10% wt/vol solution) were added. Samples were vortexed thoroughly and incubated at 100\u00b0C for 10 min, then cooled to room temperature. Absorbance at 820 nm was measured and phospholipid concentration was estimated by comparison of vacuole lipid samples to the phosphate standards.

When small headgroup lipids were omitted, the amount of PC was adjusted to bring the sum to 100%. \u03b2-octylglucoside was added to 160 mM from a 0.5 M solution in methanol and samples were dried under a stream of nitrogen, then in vacuo. Samples were dissolved in a fivefold concentrate of RB150+Mg (0.1 M HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.75 M NaCl, 50% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) by several cycles of vortexing for 10 s, rocker mixing for 30 min, and bath sonication for 5 min, yielding mixed micellar solutions with 4 mM lipids and 50 mM detergent. Lipid micellar solutions (200 \u00b5l) were mixed with a mixed micellar solution of purified Ypt7p and the indicated SNAREs (550 \u00b5l) and 250 \u00b5l of either Cy5-derivatized streptavidin (from KPL, Gaithersburg, MD; 8 \u00b5M final) or biotinylated phycoerythrin (Life Technologies; 4 \u00b5M final).

It is found that at physiological concentration (for vacuolar SNAREs), there is a very large effect in the presence of small neutral lipids that are thought to disrupt the lipid bilayer (such as PE, DAG, ERG). Upon higher SNARE concentration, the effect is partially compensated. The starting point for these experiments is the vacuolar lipid mix, and then the individual lipid components are varied. Most importantly, a true content mixing assay was used."

Much of the literature on SNARE-dependent membrane fusion has focused on understanding the roles of proteins in inducing and/or regulating fusion, but much less attention has been paid to the lipids and it is clear from studies of other systems that some lipids can be critical for the mechanism of fusion because of their geometry. The authors now have taken advantage of their very extensive characterization of yeast vacuolar fusion and show that fusion requires lipids with small head groups (which favor stalk formation) when using low protein-to-lipid ratios (on the order of 1:5000 or 1:9000). Actually the term low here refers to comparison to what has been commonly used in the literature for reconstitutions, but the authors report in this paper that these protein densities are still comparable or higher than the physiological densities present in vacuoles. The fact that higher SNAREs densities can bypass at least partially the need for the lipids with small head groups is in itself an important finding. It could also suggest different fusion mechanisms or pathways under the different conditions."

Ypt7p is sufficient on RPLs of any lipid composition, even PC/PS, to allow vigorous clustering by HOPS (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hickey and Wickner, 2010</a>). The finding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) that the RPLs give comparable trans-SNARE pairing is of course in full accord with them having undergone comparable tethering.
