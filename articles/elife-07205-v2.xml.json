The conserved Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants and modifies chromatin at its targets. Histones modified by PRC2 can be inherited through cell division. However, it remains unclear whether this inheritance can direct long-term memory of individual gene expression states (cis memory) or instead if local chromatin states are dictated by the concentrations of diffusible factors (trans memory). By monitoring the expression of two copies of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> Polycomb target gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C </i>(<i>FLC</i>) in the same plants, we show that one copy can be repressed while the other is active. Furthermore, this \u2018mixed\u2019 expression state is inherited through many cell divisions as plants develop. These data demonstrate that epigenetic memory of <i>FLC</i> expression is stored not in trans but in cis."

The conserved Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants and modifies chromatin at its targets. Histones modified by PRC2 can be inherited through cell division. However, it remains unclear whether this inheritance can direct long-term memory of individual gene expression states (cis memory) or instead if local chromatin states are dictated by the concentrations of diffusible factors (trans memory). By monitoring the expression of two copies of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> Polycomb target gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C </i>(<i>FLC</i>) in the same plants, we show that one copy can be repressed while the other is active. Furthermore, this \u2018mixed\u2019 expression state is inherited through many cell divisions as plants develop. These data demonstrate that epigenetic memory of <i>FLC</i> expression is stored not in trans but in cis."

If this 'memory of cold' is held locally in the chromatin of the <i>FLC</i> gene, then it should be possible for two copies of the <i>FLC</i> gene in the same cell to show different gene activities. However, if the memory is stored more globally inside each cell by other proteins, then the two copies should have identical gene activities."

Furthermore, it was found that this pattern of gene activity is passed onto the daughter cells when the original cell divides."

Central to this debate is Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a key transcriptional regulator in animals and plants. PRC2 catalyses methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cao et al., 2002</a>) and mutagenesis experiments have shown that K27 is necessary for PRC2-mediated repression (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pengelly et al., 2013</a>). DNA replication poses a significant challenge to histone-modification based memory as patterns of modifications must be faithfully transmitted to daughter DNA strands (<a href=\"#bib44\">Steffen and Ringrose, 2014</a>). During replication, maternal histones are shared between daughter chromosomes where they re-associate close to their original location (<a href=\"#bib41\">Radman-Livaja et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Annunziato, 2005</a>). Since PRC2 has affinity for H3K27me3, it has been proposed that H3K27me3 on inherited histones could recruit PRC2 to daughter DNA strands in order to similarly modify newly incorporated, unmodified histones (<a href=\"#bib32\">Margueron et al., 2009</a>). Supporting the hypothesis that modified histones are indeed the key inherited cis memory element, it was recently observed that passage of H3K27-methylated histones to daughter chromosomes can occur in the absence of functional PRC2 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gaydos et al., 2014</a>). Other studies have suggested that Polycomb proteins themselves are maintained locally through DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib38\">Petruk et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Francis et al., 2009</a>)."

                        "text": "These studies provide valuable mechanistic information about how a Polycomb system <i>could</i> store the memory of transcriptional states of individual genes in cis. However, to definitively demonstrate that memory <i>is</i> stored in cis, it is necessary to show that two copies of the same DNA sequence can be independently maintained in different transcriptional states in the same nucleus (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bonasio et al., 2010</a>). This has been observed in genomic imprinting and in random X-chromosome inactivation. Since imprinting involves DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ferguson-Smith, 2011</a>), and X-chromosome inactivation involves chromosome-wide changes in chromatin structure and nuclear positioning (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gendrel et al., 2014</a>), it remains an open question whether Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can store epigenetic memory. Cis memory has also been implicated in random monoallelic expression. However, studies so far have been limited to genes with naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Deng et al., 2014</a>) or are performed on fixed tissues limiting conclusions regarding heritability (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gendrel et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, a requirement for chromatin-modifying factors in epigenetic memory does not necessarily imply that memory is itself stored in chromatin."

                        "text": "To address the question of whether Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can instruct its own inheritance and therefore constitutes a cis memory system, we exploited the classic epigenetic process of vernalization in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Vernalization is the acceleration of flowering following prolonged cold exposure and is mediated by cold-induced epigenetic repression of the Polycomb target gene and floral repressor <i>FLC. FLC</i> repression requires PRC2 but is independent of DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Finnegan et al., 2005</a>), making it a useful system for studying the cis-memory storage capability of Polycomb at a single gene. In vernalized plants, <i>FLC</i> expression is bistable, with the number of cells in which <i>FLC</i> is stably repressed increasing quantitatively with the duration of prior cold exposure (<a href=\"#bib1\">Angel et al., 2011</a>). Cold exposure results in localization of a plant-homeodomain-PRC2 complex (PHD-PRC2) to a small nucleation region within the <i>FLC</i> gene, which leads to locally increased H3K27me3 and co-ordinately decreased H3K36me3 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Angel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">De Lucia et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Finnegan and Dennis, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). On return to warm, the PHD-PRC2 complex spreads across the gene leading to high H3K27me3 over the whole locus and stable repression (<a href=\"#bib1\">Angel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">De Lucia et al., 2008</a>). After cold, H3K27me3 is present at the <i>FLC</i> promoter and gene body but does not spread to neighbouring genes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Angel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Finnegan and Dennis, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). Polycomb-dependent <i>FLC</i> repression is maintained throughout plant development until it is reset during embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gendall et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Crevillen et al., 2014</a>). If <i>FLC</i> transcriptional states are defined by concentrations of diffusible factors (trans memory), then all copies of <i>FLC</i> within a cell should be in the same transcriptional state. On the other hand, if <i>FLC</i> chromatin states instruct their own inheritance (cis memory), then it should be possible for different copies of <i>FLC</i> within a cell to exist in different heritable transcriptional states."

We generated plants expressing FLC tagged with either Venus or mCherry fluorescent protein in the <i>FRI</i>-sf2 <i>flc-2</i> genetic background (<a href=\"#bib33\">Michaels et al., 1999</a>). The transgenes consist of 12 kb of genomic DNA surrounding <i>FLC</i> with the <i>Venus</i> or <i>mCherry</i> sequence inserted as a translational fusion into <i>FLC</i> exon 6 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The early flowering phenotype of <i>flc-2</i> mutants was fully rescued in transgenic lines, demonstrating that the fusion proteins are functional (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Expression of full-length FLC-Venus fusion protein was confirmed by immunoprecipitation, followed by immunoblot and mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Like wild-type Columbia line <i>FRI</i>-sf2 (Col-FRI), <i>FLC-Venus</i> and <i>FLC-mCherry</i> plants responded to cold exposure by accelerating flowering (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This indicates that the <i>FLC</i> transgenes were stably repressed similarly to endogenous <i>FLC</i> after cold. Epigenetic repression was confirmed to be quantitatively dependent on the duration of cold exposure for <i>FLC-Venus</i> at the transcriptional level in both roots and shoots, and also at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>).

Roots provide an excellent system for studying heritability of epigenetic states because cell lineages are visible as continuous files of cells that arise from repeated anticlinal divisions along the longitudinal axis of the growing root (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dolan et al., 1993</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In warm conditions, stem cells at the root tip divide approximately once every two days, while for other meristematic cells this occurs approximately once per day (<a href=\"#bib6\">Campilho et al., 2006</a>). Each cell undergoes several divisions before reaching the elongation zone whereupon cell division no longer takes place and cells begin endoreduplication. Therefore, 7 days after plants are transferred from cold, a single cell in the stem cell niche will have given rise to a lineage that encompasses a long file of cells in the root meristem. These files allow a direct assay of the mitotic stability of the epigenetic state in vivo. Strikingly, images of FLC-Venus and FLC-mCherry 7 days after cold exposure showed long files of cells in the same expression state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), demonstrating the long-term mitotic stability of the active and repressed transcriptional states. Such files make it implausible that the observed expression levels in single cells are the result of transcriptional noise. To quantitatively characterize the <i>FLC-Venus</i> expression status in individual cells after different durations of cold, we developed an automated image analysis procedure to calculate the mean FLC-Venus intensity inside each cell (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). As suggested by individual images, our unbiased analysis of 53 roots (8547 reconstructed cells) revealed that the number of cells expressing <i>FLC-Venus</i> decreased quantitatively with the duration of cold exposure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Importantly, <i>FLC-Venus</i> expression was bimodal after 6 or 8 weeks cold, and almost all cells were silenced after 10 weeks cold (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

We crossed <i>FLC-mCherry</i> to <i>FLC-Venus</i> plants to generate F1 hybrids carrying a single copy of each transgene. In a trans-based memory, the only possible heritable expression states of <i>FLC-Venus</i>/<i>FLC-mCherry</i> are ON/ON and OFF/OFF, because epigenetic information is stored as a diffusible signal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In a cis-based memory, all four states ON/ON, ON/OFF, OFF/ON, and OFF/OFF are possible because the information is stored at the locus itself (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). As expected, non-vernalized roots showed uniform ON/ON expression of both transgenes in all cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To stochastically induce repression of the two <i>FLC</i> transgenes, we exposed F1 plants to 4\u20136 weeks of cold followed by 7 days growth in warm. Strikingly, we observed long files of cells in which one <i>FLC</i> reporter was stably repressed, while the other remained stably activated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In fact, we observed long-term mitotic stability of all four possible combinations: <i>FLC-Venus</i>/<i>FLC-mCherry</i> ON/ON, ON/OFF, OFF/ON, and OFF/OFF (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Specific nucleic acid structures (<a href=\"#bib29\">Klose et al., 2013</a>), non-coding RNAs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Herzog et al., 2014</a>) (for example the chromatin-associated <i>COOLAIR</i> antisense transcripts at <i>FLC</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Csorba et al., 2014</a>)), and histone variants (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jacob et al., 2014</a>) may also play important roles.

To prepare the masked cell wall data for segmentation into individual cells, a Gaussian filter (using a standard deviation of 2 pixels) followed by median-based local thresholding (using Fiji's Auto Local Threshold plugin and a radius of 40 pixels) was applied to each plane of the stack. Each image was skeletonized using the Fiji Skeletonize plugin and then segmented using the Watershed plugin. Together, these steps generated an individual 2D segmentation for each cell wall image in the stack. The structure of the root was then reconstructed in 3D by comparing cells in segmented 2D images with those in neighbouring planes. Briefly, cells in 2D planes were considered part of the same 3D cell if the following two criteria were satisfied: first, their centroids were within a distance of 20 pixels from one another, and second, their relative areas did not vary by more than 50%. In addition to these criteria, the maximum extent of a single cell in the z-direction was limited to 18 \u03bcm (6 z-planes). This algorithm was implemented in Python (<a href=\"http://www.python.org/\">http://www.python.org</a>) using the scikit-image library (<a href=\"http://scikit-image.org/\">http://scikit-image.org/</a>).

Recently, transgenic <i>FLC</i> constructs lacking the <i>COOLAIR</i> promoter were used to demonstrate a role for <i>COOLAIR</i> in promoting transcriptional down-regulation of <i>FLC</i> during cold exposure (<a href=\"#bib9\">Csorba et al., 2014</a>).

Furthermore, if this were the case, we would expect one of the transgenes (either <i>FLC-Venus</i> or <i>FLC-mCherry</i>) to be preferentially silenced before the other in F1 plants. That we see no obvious bias in the amount of FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry ON/OFF versus OFF/ON cells, suggests that both transgenes have similar probabilities of being repressed during cold.
