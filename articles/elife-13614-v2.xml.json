To survive, <i>C. elegans</i> dauer larvae and stationary phase <i>S. cerevisiae</i> require elevated amounts of the disaccharide trehalose. We found that dauer larvae and stationary phase yeast switched into a gluconeogenic mode in which metabolism was reoriented toward production of sugars from non-carbohydrate sources. This mode depended on full activity of the glyoxylate shunt (GS), which enables synthesis of trehalose from acetate. The GS was especially critical during preparation of worms for harsh desiccation (preconditioning) and during the entry of yeast into stationary phase. Loss of the GS dramatically decreased desiccation tolerance in both organisms. Our results reveal a novel physiological role for the GS and elucidate a conserved metabolic rewiring that confers desiccation tolerance on organisms as diverse as worm and yeast."

The experiments revealed that while preparing for desiccation, both species change their metabolism to favor creating sugars rather than releasing energy. In this process, the worms and yeast use a biochemical pathway called the glyoxylate shunt, which can convert fat or acetic acid into sugar. Genetic mutations that deactivate this pathway severely reduce the ability of both organisms to produce trehalose and tolerate desiccation. From these findings, Erkut et al. conclude that the source of trehalose in non-feeding worms is their fat deposits, while in yeast it is acetate: a molecule that is derived from ethanol, the end-product of the fermentation process."

The molecules that regulate similar metabolic transitions will also need to be identified in future studies. Ultimately, understanding these processes could present new ways of diagnosing and treating metabolic diseases such as diabetes and cancer."

For species with no means of preventing evaporative water loss, drought might result in desiccation, and eventually death. To cope with this environmental insult, many organisms enter an ametabolic state known as anhydrobiosis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Keilin, 1959</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Leprince and Buitink, 2015</a>). In this state, organisms can persist in the absence of water for a long period of time; when water becomes available, they exit the anhydrobiotic state and fully resume their normal activities. The nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> are excellent anhydrobiotes. Studies of these two model organisms have revealed various strategies for desiccation tolerance, many of which appear to be broadly conserved among other anhydrobiotes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dupont et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Erkut and Kurzchalia, 2015</a>)."

In <i>C. elegans,</i> trehalose preserves the native packing of membranes in the dried state (<a href=\"#bib16\">Erkut et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">2012</a>) and stabilizes membranes against the adverse effects of fast rehydration (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abusharkh et al., 2014</a>). In yeast, trehalose also functions as a long-lived chaperone, preventing protein aggregation upon desiccation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</a>). These observations suggest that this disaccharide plays conserved roles in desiccation tolerance. However, the metabolic basis for synthesis of trehalose remains largely unknown. In this study, we sought to identify the source of trehalose carbons and the pathway(s) that promote trehalose biosynthesis and accumulation."

Similarly, stationary phase yeast cells, which are tolerant to desiccation, also accumulate trehalose (<a href=\"#bib5\">Calahan et al., 2011</a>).

Finally, in the stationary phase, yeast cells accumulate trehalose and glycogen (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fran\u00e7ois and Parrou, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schweizer and Dickinson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Werner-Washburne et al., 1993</a>)."

How is this transition implemented? In theory, the TCA cycle could provide the intermediates required for gluconeogenesis, but this pathway generates substantial amounts of ATP, as well as NADH, which must be oxidized to NAD<sup>+</sup> to maintain cellular redox balance (<a href=\"#bib61\">Voet and Voet, 2010</a>). At first glance it seems counterintuitive that these two processes run in parallel, considering the low energetic demands of dauer larvae and stationary phase yeast cells. However, cells could be driven into gluconeogenesis via an alternate route, the glyoxylate shunt (GS) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>, depicted in red). The GS has been implicated in anhydrobiosis in the nematode <i>Aphelencus avenae</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Madin et al., 1985</a>). We hypothesized that, in <i>C. elegans</i> dauer larvae and stationary phase yeast cells, the GS serves a critical function in anabolic processes required for desiccation tolerance, in particular by enabling or promoting gluconeogenesis for trehalose biosynthesis."

Expanding our studies to the budding yeast, we discovered that <i>S. cerevisiae</i> utilizes a similar metabolic strategy, relying on the GS to drive trehalose synthesis and achieve desiccation tolerance. These results reveal, for the first time, a functionally conserved and central role for the GS in a process that is essential for survival under certain conditions."

Oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) in these larvae were measured using an extracellular flux analyzer (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

By contrast, trehalose induction upon preconditioning differed dramatically between <i>daf-2</i> and <i>daf-2;icl-1</i> dauer larvae. We quantitated the total amount of trehalose, normalized to the amount of soluble protein, in both strains before and after preconditioning (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>).

The average increase in labeled trehalose in <i>daf-2</i> was larger than the increase in total (i.e., unlabeled) trehalose (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), suggesting preferential use of lipid sources for sugar production in this strain.

These differences in trehalose induction levels between <i>daf-2</i> and <i>daf-2;icl-1</i> cannot be assigned to the trehalose biosynthetic pathway because the trehalose 6-phosphate synthase (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, reaction 25) activity of <i>daf-2</i> is not higher than that of <i>daf-2;icl-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

As described earlier, dauer larvae accumulate large amounts of trehalose, despite the fact that worms in this stage of the life cycle do not feed or grow. A similar phenomenon occurs in budding yeast. In the presence of its preferred carbon source (glucose), yeast uses fermentative glycolysis during rapid proliferation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>); under these conditions, very little trehalose accumulates (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</a>). However, once glucose concentration falls, the cells undergo a diauxic shift, thereafter using aerobic respiration for their energetic needs in order to continue proliferation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6A</a>); eventually, as external energy sources are depleted, the cells enter stationary phase. Although both glycolytic and respiratory activities are low in stationary phase, the cells continue to accumulate trehalose and glycogen, which ultimately constitute &gt;30% of total cell mass (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fran\u00e7ois and Parrou, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Werner-Washburne et al., 1993</a>). Thus, yeast might also rely on alternate carbon metabolism to generate trehalose. Therefore, we asked whether the GS in yeast can be used to drive gluconeogenesis for synthesis of trehalose."

In addition, we compared the growth rates of WT and GS-deficient cells growing on acetate as the sole carbon source (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

To test this idea, we quantitated these metabolites in WT and GS-deficient cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013D</a>). In cells grown in glucose, following the diauxic shift (20\u2009hr, black bars) and in stationary phase (48\u2009hr, grey bars), WT cells accumulated considerable amounts of trehalose (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and glycogen (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). By contrast, despite reaching high cell densities, GS-deficient cells contained low (but detectable) amounts of trehalose, but no detectable glycogen stores (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We also measured trehalose and glycogen in WT and GS-deficient cells grown with acetate as a carbon source. Under these conditions, we observed an even greater accumulation of trehalose and glycogen in WT cells, whereas GS-deficient cells contained low levels of trehalose and no detectable glycogen (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,D</a>). As controls, we also measured the amounts of trehalose and glycogen in mutant cells lacking trehalose synthase (Tps1) or the heat-shock protein Hsp104, both of which are important for yeast desiccation tolerance (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</a>). As expected, <i>\u2206tps1</i> cells contained very low levels of trehalose, but high levels of glycogen, whereas <i>\u2206hsp104</i> cells had no defects in trehalose (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) or glycogen storage (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We also measured Tps1 and Tps2 amounts (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), which were unchanged in wild type and GS-deficient cells. This rules out the trivial explanation that GS-deficient cells have limitations in trehalose 6-phosphate synthase levels, and therefore have lower trehalose amounts. Collectively, these data show that, much like preconditioned <i>C. elegans</i> dauer larvae, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> cells rely on TCA cycle-independent acetyl-CoA consumption through the GS to synthesize trehalose and glycogen."

This state depends primarily on an active glyoxylate shunt (GS), which serves as the main route for synthesis of trehalose from TAG reserves during preconditioning. We also showed that budding yeast undergoes a conceptually convergent process. In order to survive desiccation, stationary phase yeast cells must produce high levels of trehalose from acetate or glycerol. This conversion can be successfully accomplished only in the presence of a functional GS."

Amino acids, for example, can be converted into their corresponding \u03b1-keto acids, which then undergo a specific series of reactions to enter the TCA cycle, in which they are subsequently used for gluconeogenesis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, even via utilization of amino acids or other metabolites, <i>daf-2;icl-1</i> dauer larvae cannot tolerate desiccation as well as <i>daf-2</i>. Our data indicate that an intermediate level of trehalose is insufficient for desiccation tolerance: Below some threshold level, trehalose cannot exert its protective effects and overcome the adverse consequences of desiccation. This hypothesis was previously explored in yeast (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tapia et al., 2015</a>). Our results strongly suggest that a conceptually similar trehalose threshold may exist in the worm as well. It is worth to note that gluconeogenesis is in general associated with the energetic needs of the organism. In <i>C. elegans</i> and the yeast, however, it is additionally used as a defense against environmental stress. Taking advantage of the GS, worms and yeast devote large amounts of resources to the production of trehalose, which in turn protects the organism against desiccation or other water-related stresses, such as freezing and thawing during winter."

For several decades, the germination of plant seeds was considered to be the most prominent process requiring this pathway, and it was assumed that production of sugars from seed oils was a prerequisite for germination. However, studies of <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines with no functional GS revealed that in the presence of light, this pathway is non-essential (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eastmond et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Eastmond and Graham, 2001</a>). Other studies suggested a requirement for the GS in fungal virulence (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lorenz and Fink, 2001</a>), although at present we have no mechanistic understanding of why this would be the case. To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first clearly defined physiological role for the GS in <i>C. elegans</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i>."

                        "text": "It remains unclear how the GS is regulated in animals. In the worm, regulation is directly connected to sensing of a desiccative environment (hygrosensation). We previously showed that hygrosensation is at least partially mediated by head neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Erkut et al., 2013</a>). Although we still do not know the details of this sensation, one of its downstream effects is likely to be increased lipolysis. This process, followed by \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, yields acetyl-CoA, the fuel for GS. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that lipolysis determines the extent of the GS. Another finding that supports this view is the localization of ICL-1 within the organism. As shown above, ICL-1 is predominantly localized in the hypodermis. The major enzyme that synthesizes trehalose (TPS) is localized to the same tissue (<a href=\"#bib49\">Penkov et al., 2015</a>), but is not expressed in the gut. On the other hand, the major TAG deposit in the form of fat droplets resides in the gut, and to some extent in the hypodermis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mak, 2011</a>). Thus, synthesis of trehalose in the hypodermis must depend on the transport of fatty acids from the gut. Indeed, as we previously found, one of the fatty acid-binding proteins (FAR-3) is strongly upregulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels upon preconditioning (~160 and four\u00a0fold, respectively) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Erkut et al., 2013</a>). FAR-3 is predicted to have a 20 amino acid signal sequence for secretion, and could thus be involved in the transport of fatty acids between cells. These observations strongly suggest that the regulation of the GS by substrate availability is a complex process that depends on interactions between different tissues."

By contrast, in plants and the yeast, this pathway is split between mitochondria and a specialized organelle (glyoxysome or peroxisome) or the cytoplasm. Furthermore, in contrast to yeast and many other organisms, <i>C. elegans</i> ICL-1 is a bifunctional enzyme with both glyoxylase and malate synthase activities. The physiological meaning of these differences remains elusive, but they suggest that transition into gluconeogenic mode is regulated differently in different organisms."

L3 and dauer larvae of <i>daf-2</i> and <i>daf-2;icl-1</i> strains were grown in liquid culture for 3 days. Then, they were collected and washed extensively to remove excess bacteria and debris. Approximately 100 worms were pipetted into each well of a 96-well Seahorse XF<sup>e</sup> assay plate, except for the 4 corner wells, which were used to estimate the background measurement. Initial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured until the readings stabilized. Then, sodium azide with phenol red indicator was injected into half of the wells at a final concentration of 20\u2009mM. The rest of the wells were injected only phenol red indicator in water. OCR was measured once again until it stabilized. Then 4 subsequent measurements were done in 6.5\u2009min intervals. Finally, exact number of worms in each well were counted and used for normalization. A small number of abnormal readings were also filtered out at this stage. On average, 7\u20138 wells (technical replicates) were used for each condition."

The steps of the glyoxylate shunt and the underlying enzymology were described many decades ago but the biological function of this metabolic pathway remained elusive. Thus the manuscript provides potentially an interesting new insight into the importance of regulating metabolism to achieve the proper characteristics of the quiescent state. Many experiments presented in the manuscript are rigorously performed and the quality of the data is excellent. However, the authors need to address important issues to strengthen the manuscript."

However it is possible that the altered metabolic state reduces the level of the biosynthetic enzymes themselves. The authors should quantitate the levels of Tps1 and Tps2 in <i>icl</i> mutants in yeast and worms. This concern raises the more general question whether the function of the glyoxylate pathway is specific to desiccation tolerance or whether it contributes to the overall metabolic state of the dauer or stationary cells. The authors should test whether other representative characteristics of these states, survival, heat tolerance, etc. are altered in the glyoxylate shunt mutants. The answers to these questions might alter the authors' conclusions and discussion."

Then they were mixed and separated on 2 dimensions. Individual R<sub>f</sub> values calculated from the 1D TLC runs coincided largely with each molecule in question also on 2D. Furthermore, the positions of glutamate and glutamine were confirmed in another set of experiments, where glutamate- or glutamine-lacking mixtures of amino acids were separated on 2D.

This is increased 5 fold upon preconditioning in <i>daf-2</i> larvae, but only 2 fold in <i>daf-2; icl-1</i> larvae. Both increases are statistically significant. During the revision of the manuscript, upon the advice of the reviewer, we also measured the fold change of trehalose labeled with <sup><a href=\"#bib13\">14</a></sup>C-acetate in these strains (subsection \u201cThin-layer chromatography\u201d, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). Because we could not measure the absolute amounts of labeled trehalose, we could only measure the difference in folds. The induction of labeled trehalose is ~6 fold for <i>daf-2</i> and 2 fold for <i>daf-2;icl-1</i> (subsection \u201cAn intact GS is required for utilization of acetate/fatty acids for trehalose biosynthesis\u201d), suggesting that the utilization of acetate (and thus fatty acids) for gluconeogenesis and trehalose biosynthesis depends on the existence of a functional GS.

The steps of the glyoxylate shunt and the underlying enzymology were described many decades ago but the biological function of this metabolic pathway remained elusive. Thus the manuscript provides potentially an interesting new insight into the importance of regulating metabolism to achieve the proper characteristics of the quiescent state. Many experiments presented in the manuscript are rigorously performed and the quality of the data is excellent. However, the authors need to address important issues to strengthen the manuscript.</i>"

We measured enzyme levels in the worm as well as in the yeast (subsection \u201cTrehalose measurement from worm extracts\u201d, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In worm, we quantified the total trehalose 6-phosphate synthase (TPS) activity in lysates of <i>daf-2</i> and <i>daf-2;icl-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We think this approach is very informative, because the activity of an enzyme may depend on other factors such as post-translational modifications or inhibitors. In yeast we measured Tps1 and Tps2 protein levels by expressing FLAG-tagged proteins under the control of their own promoters (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In both organisms TPS levels in wild type and glyoxalate shunt deficient mutants are similar. These results rule out the trivial explanation that GS-deficient worms/cells have limitations in trehalose biosynthesis and therefore have lower levels of trehalose."

Our results indicate that the sensitivity of both organisms to heat shock is independent of the GS. Remarkably, however, GS-deficient yeast cells were very sensitive to freeze-thaw stress compared to wild type cells. These results collective strengthen our conclusion that the GS is specifically involved in water-related stress tolerance, such as desiccation or freezing."
