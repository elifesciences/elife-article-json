Now, in eLife, Daniel Nelson from the University of Maryland and co-workers \u2013 including Yang Shen (Maryland) and Marilia Barros (Carnegie Mellon University) as joint first authors \u2013 report the unexpected ability of an antimicrobial enzyme called PlyC to find and kill <i>Spy</i> that is hiding inside human cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Shen et al., 2016</a>)."

They propose that PlyCB binds to lipid rafts (shown in green) that are enriched in PS; this causes the membrane to fold around PlyC, which ultimately enters the cell inside a vesicle. These vesicles may fuse with bacteria-containing vesicles, giving PlyC access to intracellular <i>Spy</i> (depicted as brown circles). Alternatively, PlyC may escape the vesicle and interact with and kill <i>Spy</i> that is free in the host cell."

Further work is needed to confirm if PlyC enters cells via lipid raft-mediated endocytosis, and to determine how PlyC ultimately meets the intracellular <i>Spy</i> in order to kill it.
