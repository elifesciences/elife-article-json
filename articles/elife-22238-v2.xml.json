                    "text": "The \u2018pseudokinase\u2019 SgK196 is a protein O-mannose kinase (POMK) that catalyzes an essential phosphorylation step during biosynthesis of the laminin-binding glycan on \u03b1-dystroglycan. However, the catalytic mechanism underlying this activity remains elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of <i>Danio rerio</i> POMK in complex with Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, ADP, aluminum fluoride, and the GalNAc-\u03b23-GlcNAc-\u03b24-Man trisaccharide substrate, thereby providing a snapshot of the catalytic transition state of this unusual kinase. The active site of POMK is established by residues located in non-canonical positions and is stabilized by a disulfide bridge. GalNAc-\u03b23-GlcNAc-\u03b24-Man is recognized by a surface groove, and the GalNAc-\u03b23-GlcNAc moiety mediates the majority of interactions with POMK. Expression of various POMK mutants in <i>POMK</i> knockout cells further validated the functional requirements of critical residues. Our results provide important insights into the ability of POMK to function specifically as a glycan kinase, and highlight the structural diversity of the human kinome."

However, the catalytic mechanism underlying this activity remains elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of <i>Danio rerio</i> POMK in complex with Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, ADP, aluminum fluoride, and the GalNAc-\u03b23-GlcNAc-\u03b24-Man trisaccharide substrate, thereby providing a snapshot of the catalytic transition state of this unusual kinase. The active site of POMK is established by residues located in non-canonical positions and is stabilized by a disulfide bridge. GalNAc-\u03b23-GlcNAc-\u03b24-Man is recognized by a surface groove, and the GalNAc-\u03b23-GlcNAc moiety mediates the majority of interactions with POMK. Expression of various POMK mutants in <i>POMK</i> knockout cells further validated the functional requirements of critical residues. Our results provide important insights into the ability of POMK to function specifically as a glycan kinase, and highlight the structural diversity of the human kinome."

Recently, the collection of human kinases has been further expanded by the discovery of novel kinases that function specifically in the secretory pathway (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dudkiewicz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sreelatha et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tagliabracci et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2013b</a>). These proteins are so divergent from the canonical EPKs that they eluded earlier identification and were not included on the kinome tree. Among them, four-jointed, a Golgi kinase, phosphorylates atypical cadherins Fat and Dachsous to regulate planar cell polarity in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ishikawa et al., 2008</a>). Fam20C is the long-sought physiological casein kinase that phosphorylates many secreted proteins (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tagliabracci et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2015</a>). Fam20B is a xylose kinase that regulates the biosynthesis of proteoglycans (<a href=\"#bib32\">Koike et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wen et al., 2014</a>). Fam20A lacks intrinsic kinase activity and functions as a positive regulator of Fam20C (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cui et al., 2015</a>). The crystal structure of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> Fam20C orthologue reveals an atypical kinase architecture remotely related to the EPKs (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xiao et al., 2013</a>). Importantly, mutations in the Fam20 proteins cause several diseases in humans including biomineralization defects, underscoring the physiological significance of phosphorylation-regulated processes in the secretory pathway (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sreelatha et al., 2015</a>)."

The canonical EPKs feature several highly conserved structural elements that are essential for catalysis, which are exemplified by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), including Lys72<sup>PKA</sup> from strand \u03b23 that coordinates ATP, Glu91<sup>PKA</sup> from helix \u03b1C that pairs with Lys72<sup>PKA</sup>, Asp166<sup>PKA</sup> in the H/YRD motif that serves as the catalytic base, and Asp184<sup>PKA</sup> in the DFG motif that functions as the primary metal-binding residue (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hanks and Hunter, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jura et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</a>). None of these important residues or motifs were found in POMK (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eyers and Murphy, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Manning et al., 2002</a>). In this study, we have used a multidisciplinary approach to determine the architecture of the active site and the mechanisms underlying the catalytic and substrate-recognition activities of this unusual kinase. We show the crystal structure of <i>Danio rerio</i> POMK in complex with Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, ADP, aluminum fluoride, and the GalNAc-\u03b23-GlcNAc-\u03b24-Man trisaccharide substrate. This structure provides a snapshot of the catalytic transition state of this glycan kinase, revealing an unprecedented kinase active site that is established by residues located in non-canonical positions and is stabilized by a disulfide bridge. The structure further reveals that GalNAc-\u03b23-GlcNAc-\u03b24-Man is recognized by a surface groove, and that the GalNAc-\u03b23-GlcNAc moiety mediates the majority of interactions with POMK. We further show by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis that GalNAc-\u03b23-GlcNAc-\u03b24-Man binds to POMK with a dissociation constant of 30.2 \u03bcM. Finally, we express various <i>Homo sapiens</i> POMK mutants in a <i>POMK</i> knockout cell line to validate the functional requirements of critical residues in POMK and to understand disease-causing mutations. Our results consolidate the catalytic function of POMK during the post-translational processing of \u03b1-DG, and facilitate a better understanding of the dystroglycanopathies and various physiological systems that depend on dystroglycan."

The critical role of this Lys in DrPOMK is instead served by Lys91<sup>DrPOMK</sup> located at the beginning of strand \u03b22 that reaches into the active site and interacts with the phosphate groups of ADP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Mutation of the corresponding Lys in HsPOMK to Gly completely abolished kinase activity (K93G, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The catalytic activity is restored in a double mutant, K93G/S108K, which reinstalls the Lys in strand \u03b23. In fact, this mutant, having both the Gly-rich loop and the \u03b23 Lys restored to \u2018normal\u2019, has enhanced kinase activity in vitro compared to the wild-type enzyme. Another important Lys involved in nucleotide-binding is Lys208<sup>DrPOMK</sup> located in helix \u03b1CL.

In the control C665 cells (a diploid cell line containing duplicated chromosomes of HAP1), both the glycoepitope of \u03b1-DG (recognized by antibody IIH6) and the \u03b1-DG core protein (recognized by antibody AF6868) were detected at\u00a0~120 kDa (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The glycan modification on \u03b1-DG was severely reduced in the <i>POMK</i> KO cells, as suggested by the disappearance of the glycoepitope and the mobility change of the \u03b1-DG core protein. Consistently, these cells were defective in binding to laminin in a laminin overlay assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Expression of wild-type POMK or the K93G/S108K mutant by adenoviruses fully rescued the functional glycosylation of \u03b1-DG. In contrast, expression of K93G, D204A, D227A, or A230E did not restore the glycoepitope, the molecular weight, or the laminin-binding ability of \u03b1-DG (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These results demonstrate the importance of these residues for POMK function in vivo, corroborating our structural observations and in vitro biochemical analyses."

Besides the frameshift and nonsense mutations (F96fs, Q109*) that result in the loss of the majority of the kinase domain, three missense mutations have also been reported: L137R, Q258R, and V302D (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To understand how these alterations lead to disease, we modeled the structure of HsPOMK (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) based on that of DrPOMK using Swiss-Model (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biasini et al., 2014</a>). Due to the high degree of sequence similarity between these two proteins, the resulting structural model shows a high GMQE (Global Model Quality Estimation) score (0.71), indicating its reliability. This gives us confidence to use this comparative model to gain mechanistic insights into the disease-causing mutants. Leu137 corresponds to Leu135<sup>DrPOMK</sup> and is involved in forming the regulatory spine structure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Mutation of this residue to an Arg would disrupt this important internal hydrophobic network. Gln258 is located below the Cys203-Cys244 (Cys201<sup>DrPOMK</sup>-Cys241<sup>DrPOMK</sup>) disulfide bridge and points inside. Mutation to an Arg would collide with nearby residues including Lys284 and destabilize this region. Val302 is surrounded by hydrophobic residues including Trp175, Leu179, Leu293, and Leu338, which together anchor helix \u03b1H to the N- and C-terminal ends of helices \u03b1E and \u03b1F. Mutation to an Asp would severely disrupt the structure of the C-lobe. L137R failed to phosphorylate the GalNAc-\u03b23-GlcNAc-\u03b24-Man trisaccharide (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013</a>). Q258R and V302D were also unable to phosphorylate the trisaccharide in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), nor could they restore IIH6 immunoreactivity in vivo (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), suggesting that these mutants are functionally defective. Finally, it is interesting to note that some patients with a POMK Q109* mutation presented with a limb-girdle muscle dystrophy (<a href=\"#bib14\">Di Costanzo et al., 2014</a>), while others presented with a more severe congenital muscular dystrophy (<a href=\"#bib51\">von Renesse et al., 2014</a>). This could suggest that there is a modifying gene for the dystroglycanopathies, or a <i>POMK</i>-like gene that can compensate for the lack of <i>POMK</i>, or even there is exon skipping event that could result in a semi-functional POMK protein. Further studies are needed to precisely define the molecular pathology of this mutation."

Second, it contains a type II transmembrane domain and functions in the ER lumen. Third, it specifically phosphorylates an oligosaccharide. Our results reported here reinforce the catalytic function of POMK and demonstrate that the active site of POMK is established by residues located in non-canonical positions, a phenomenon known as active site migration (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kinch and Grishin, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Todd et al., 2001</a>). POMK is not the first kinome member to display active site migration. The WNK (<span class=\"underline\">w</span>ith <span class=\"underline\">n</span>o lysine [<span class=\"underline\">K</span>]) kinases lack a Lys72<sup>PKA</sup>-equivalent residue in strand \u03b23 and use a Lys in the Gly-rich loop similar to POMK (<a href=\"#bib39\">Min et al., 2004</a>); and the atypical kinase haspin/Gsg2 (haploid germ cell-specific nuclear protein kinase/germ cell-specific gene-2) has a DY/FT motif to compensate for the absence of the DFG (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eswaran et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Villa et al., 2009</a>). POMK is unusual among the known kinases since none of the catalytically essential residues are found at conventional positions in the primary structure. Approximately 10% of the kinome members have been classified as pseudokinases, only a handful of which have been rigorously studied (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eyers and Murphy, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Manning et al., 2002</a>).

The authors present very strong evidence that POMK is an ER-localized glycan kinase, rather than a pseudokinase. The previous designation of POMK as a pseudokinase was based upon the lack of any of the active site residues found in protein kinases at any of the expected positions. The crystal structure shows that the residues necessary for ATP binding and catalysis are located at other positions indicating that POMK displays active site migration. One interesting feature of the structure is that the active site is linked to the activation loop via a disulfide that is conserved in POMK. The authors have done a nice job of analyzing a panel of POMK mutants, both those based upon the crystal structure, and two patient alleles. Analysis of the structure based point mutants confirms the importance of residues that contact ADP-AlF3 and GalNAc-\u03b23-GlcNAc-\u03b24-Man. This manuscript also serves the role as presenting data for how a pseudokinase can in fact be an actual functional kinase and thus suggests that other pseudokinases should be investigated for kinase enzymatic activity. The paper is well written, the experiments follow a logical order, and the findings are of significant moment. There are only a few minor questions/comments that are listed below and enthusiasm for this manuscript is extremely high. The three reviewers indicated that this manuscript needed very minor modifications before it would be appropriate for <i>eLife</i>."

The authors present very strong evidence that POMK is an ER-localized glycan kinase, rather than a pseudokinase. The previous designation of POMK as a pseudokinase was based upon the lack of any of the active site residues found in protein kinases at any of the expected positions. The crystal structure shows that the residues necessary for ATP binding and catalysis are located at other positions indicating that POMK displays active site migration. One interesting feature of the structure is that the active site is linked to the activation loop by a disulfide that is conserved in POMK. The authors have done a nice job of analyzing a panel of POMK mutants, both those based upon the crystal structure, and two patient alleles. Analysis of the structure based point mutants confirms the importance of residues that contact ADP-AlF3 and GalNAc-\u03b23-GlcNAc-\u03b24-Man. Overall, this is an interesting and important manuscript that includes very high quality experimental evidence. The manuscript has been written so that it will be accessible to a broad audience. I do not have any major concerns with the current manuscript."

Several years ago, it was determined that mutations in POMK were causal for multiple forms of CMD ranging from LGMD to WWS. It had also been previously determined that POMK catalyzed the transfer of a phosphate to a trisaccharide structure on \u03b1-dystroglycan that served as the core structure that becomes functionally glycosylated with matriglycan. However, what was extremely puzzling is that POMK fits in the family of pseudokinases that presumably did not have actual kinase activity. This manuscript addresses at the structural level this quandary. Here they clearly define the key residues involved in catalysis and make comparisons to PKA, a typical known well-defined protein kinase. In addition, they present data that explains some of the naturally occurring mutations seen in individuals with CMD. This manuscript also serves the role as presenting data for how a pseudokinase can in fact be an actual functional kinase and thus suggests that other pseudokinases should be investigated for kinase enzymatic activity. The paper is well written, the experiments follow a logical order, and the findings are of significant moment. There are only a few minor questions/comments that are listed below and enthusiasm for this manuscript is extremely high."

A possible reason for a milder phenotype could be expression of a modifier gene like was recently found in a mild dystrophic dog. Another reason could be the expression of a compensating gene like what is seen for utrophin. Finally, an exon skipping event in the disease gene can result in a smaller semi-functional protein being expressed like what is seen in revertant fibers that are positive for dystrophin."
