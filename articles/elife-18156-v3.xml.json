The factors promoting this surveillance behavior have not been defined. Here, we report that IL7R<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes in mouse LNs rapidly produce IL17 upon bacterial and fungal challenge. We show that these innate-like lymphocytes are mostly LN resident. Ccr6 is required for their accumulation near the SCS and for efficient IL17 induction. Migration into the SCS intrinsically requires S1pr1, whereas movement from the sinus into the parenchyma involves the integrin LFA1 and its ligand ICAM1. CD169, a sialic acid-binding lectin, helps retain the cells within the sinus, preventing their loss in lymph flow. These findings establish a role for Ccr6 in augmenting innate-like lymphocyte responses to lymph-borne pathogens, and they define requirements for cell movement between parenchyma and SCS in what we speculate is a program of immune surveillance that helps achieve LN barrier immunity."

The factors promoting this surveillance behavior have not been defined. Here, we report that IL7R<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes in mouse LNs rapidly produce IL17 upon bacterial and fungal challenge. We show that these innate-like lymphocytes are mostly LN resident. Ccr6 is required for their accumulation near the SCS and for efficient IL17 induction. Migration into the SCS intrinsically requires S1pr1, whereas movement from the sinus into the parenchyma involves the integrin LFA1 and its ligand ICAM1. CD169, a sialic acid-binding lectin, helps retain the cells within the sinus, preventing their loss in lymph flow. These findings establish a role for Ccr6 in augmenting innate-like lymphocyte responses to lymph-borne pathogens, and they define requirements for cell movement between parenchyma and SCS in what we speculate is a program of immune surveillance that helps achieve LN barrier immunity."

However, activation, clonal expansion and effector lymphocyte differentiation takes several days, whereas pathogens can undergo marked replication in a matter of hours. The skin contains immune effector cells that help keep pathogen replication in check, in a process referred to as \u2018barrier immunity\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belkaid and Segre, 2014</a>). Despite this, in many cases, intact pathogens travel within minutes via lymph fluid to draining LNs. Indeed some pathogens, such as <i>Yersinia pestis</i>, appear to have evolved to undergo marked expansion only after arrival in the LN (<a href=\"#bib64\">St John et al., 2014</a>). Recently, there has been evidence indicating the existence of barrier immunity within LNs. The first LN cells exposed to lymph-borne antigens include the CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages that extend between the subcapsular sinus (SCS) or medullary sinuses and the underlying parenchyma (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barral et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Iannacone et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Phan et al., 2009</a>). Crosstalk between sinus-associated macrophages and IFN\u03b3 precommitted CD8 T cells and NK cells is important for mounting rapid Th1-like and NK cell responses against acute infection by <i>Pseudomonas aeroguinosa, Salmonella typhimurium</i> and <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Coombes et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kastenm\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>). IL17 is a cytokine with roles in anti-bacterial and anti-fungal defense that is made abundantly by effector T cells at epithelial surfaces (<a href=\"#bib42\">Littman and Rudensky, 2010</a>). Whether IL17 is produced rapidly during responses to subcapsular sinus-invaders in LNs is unclear."

These cells express high amounts of the chemokine receptors Ccr6 and Cxcr6 as well as the cytokine receptor IL7R, and they include a majority of \u03b1\u03b2 T cells but also considerable numbers of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells as well as non-T cells (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gray et al., 2012</a>). Within the IL17-committed \u03b3\u03b4 T cell population a major subset expresses a V\u03b34-containing TCR (according to the nomenclature of [<a href=\"#bib32\">Heilig and Tonegawa, 1986</a>]), and undergoes expansion in response to challenge with imiquimod or complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gray et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ramirez-Valle et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Roark et al., 2013</a>). In previous work, we found that innate-like lymphocytes isolated from peripheral LNs were heavily coated with CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophage-derived membrane fragments (\u2018blebs\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gray et al., 2012</a>). This observation suggested there may be strong adhesive interactions between these cells and the CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages. CD169 is the founding member of the Siglec family of sialic acid-binding lectins (<a href=\"#bib16\">Crocker et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Macauley et al., 2014</a>). Although CD169 is a defining feature of LN SCS macrophages and targeting antigens to CD169 can promote antibody responses (<a href=\"#bib44\">Macauley et al., 2014</a>), the function of CD169 on these cells is not fully understood."

Despite this, it is not known whether IL17-committed innate-like lymphocytes in LNs respond rapidly upon pathogen challenge, and little is understood about how these cells localize to or move in the subcapsular region. In this study, we found IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> innate-like lymphocytes were mostly LN resident and they produced IL17 within hours of bacterial or fungal challenge. Their proximity to the SCS was mediated by Ccr6 and was important for the rapid induction of IL17 following bacterial challenge. Real time intravital two photon microscopy and in vivo labeling procedures revealed that innate-like lymphocytes exchanged between the LN parenchyma and the SCS. Movement into the SCS was S1pr1 dependent, whereas return to the parenchyma involved LFA1 and ICAM1. Within the SCS, CD169-mediated adhesive interactions that helped retain the cells, presumably against the shear stresses exerted by lymph flow. This requirement was most prominent for the V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>\u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset of innate-like lymphocytes. These observations provide a model for understanding the mechanism by which innate-like lymphocytes survey the pathogen-exposed surface of the LN to protect the organ from infection."

                                "text": "IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> innate-like lymphocytes within peripheral LNs express high amounts of Cxcr6 and they include ~70% \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, ~20% \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and 5\u201310% non-T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Gray et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with previous findings, the IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup>gd T cell subset produced IL17 rapidly upon treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate\u00a0(PMA) and ionomycin or with the cytokines IL1\u03b2 and IL23 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lower graph) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gray et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gray et al., 2011</a>). These treatments also triggered rapid IL17 production from the IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup>\u03b1\u03b2 T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We therefore tested whether both the \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 subsets of IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> T cells produce IL17 in skin draining LNs following bacterial or fungal challenge. IL17 is known to play a role in host defense against cutaneous <i>Candida albicans</i> and <i>Staphyloccus aureus</i> infection (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cho et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Conti and Gaffen, 2015</a>) and to be induced in rats by <i>Y. pestis</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Comer et al., 2010</a>). Three hours after heat-killed <i>C. albicans, S. aureus</i> bioparticle, or attenuated <i>Y. pestis</i> footpad challenge, IL17 production in draining popliteal LNs was observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes were the dominant IL17 producers at this early time point after challenge (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The induction of IL17 expression in IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells upon bacterial challenge was dependent on CD169<sup>+</sup> SCS macrophages as the response was greatly blunted in CD169-DTR mice (<a href=\"#bib45\">Miyake et al., 2007</a>) pretreated with DT to ablate these cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Since IL1\u03b2 and IL23 induced IL17 production from IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro, we looked for expression of these cytokines after <i>S. aureus</i> bioparticle challenge. Transcripts for both <i>Il1b</i> and <i>Il23a</i> were upregulated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Induction of IL17 following <i>S. aureus</i> bioparticle challenge was compromised in mice lacking the ASC (Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) inflammasome subunit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), consistent with a role for IL1\u03b2 in activating IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells during the response to these bacteria."

To test this more directly, we \u2018time stamped\u2019 cells in inguinal LNs of KikGR photoconvertible protein-expressing transgenic mice by brief violet light exposure (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gray et al., 2013</a>). At 24 hr after photoconversion almost three quarters of the IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells and a similar fraction of the V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells remained resident in the LN, whereas more than 80% of the conventional \u03b1\u03b2 T cells and Ccr6<sup>\u2013</sup> V\u03b34<sup>+</sup> T cells had left the LN and been replaced by newly arriving cells. At 48 hr, the innate-like lymphocyte pool showed little further exchange, whereas naive \u03b1\u03b2 T cells were 90% replaced (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In a further approach, we examined the amount of cell exchange that occurred in parabiotic mice. Two weeks following surgery the naive \u03b1\u03b2 T cell compartment and the Ccr6<sup>\u2013</sup> V\u03b34<sup>+</sup> T cells had achieved full chimerism, whereas the innate-like lymphocytes showed only limited exchange between the paired mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

A closer examination of Cxcr6<sup>GFP/+</sup> cell behavior in this region revealed that the cells frequently made contact with CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages, and occasionally, lymphocytes could be observed crossing the layer of macrophages to reach the SCS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>).

We targeted Thy1 since this marker is expressed by all the IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells while not being present on SCS macrophages (not shown). PE-conjugated antibody was used as the large size of PE (250 kD) reduces the rate at which the antibody accesses the lymphoid tissue parenchyma (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pereira et al., 2009</a>). Thy1-PE antibody (0.2\u00a0\u03bcg) was injected into the footpad, the draining popliteal LN was isolated 5 min later and the frequency of labeled cells determined by flow cytometry. Approximately 10% of the total IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells were brightly labeled with Thy1-PE antibody compared with about 0.3% of naive T cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Among the innate-like lymphocytes, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (predominantly V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells) were preferentially labeled, with around 15\u201320% of these cells being antibody exposed. By immunofluorescence microscopy, Thy1-PE-labeled CD3\u03b5<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in the SCS and in nearby lymphatic sinuses, and few labeled cells were detected within the LN parenchyma, confirming that footpad injection of PE-conjugated antibody led to preferential labeling of lymph-exposed LN cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The broader labeling of the sinus by Thy-1 than by CD3 reflects the expression of Thy1 by lymphatic endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Jurisic et al., 2010</a>)."

This coating is thought to occur at the time of LN cell dissociation, possibly because the SCS macrophages are tightly bound to the extracellular matrix and become fragmented during mechanical preparation of the tissue. Importantly, the blebs only become bound to cells that are associated with the macrophages at the time of isolation since co-preparation of LN cells from congenically distinct animals did not lead to cross acquisition of macrophage-derived blebs by innate-like lymphocytes from the different LNs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gray et al., 2012</a>). In accord with previous findings, 30\u201340% of the IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> innate-like lymphocytes isolated from control mice were CD169 macrophage-derived membrane bleb positive (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). A higher frequency (40\u201355%) of the V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>\u03b3\u03b4 T cells were CD169 bleb positive, suggesting these cells may be preferentially associated with SCS macrophages (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Combining this analysis with Thy1-PE labeling showed that lymph-exposed innate-like lymphocytes, but not total \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, were enriched for CD169-bleb-positive cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). The Thy1-PE<sup>+</sup> CD169<sup>\u2013</sup> cells amongst total \u03b1\u03b2 T cells most likely correspond to recirculating cells that are exiting the LN via cortical and medullary sinuses."

                                "text": "S1pr1 is needed in naive lymphocyte for access to cortical and medullary lymphatic sinuses during LN egress (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cyster and Schwab, 2012</a>). S1pr1 is also required for marginal zone (MZ) B cell shuttling between the S1P high MZ and the S1P low lymphoid follicle (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arnon et al., 2013</a>). We therefore tested whether S1pr1 played a role in guiding innate-like lymphocytes into the SCS. The innate-like lymphocytes had detectable surface S1pr1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and they responded to S1P by in vitro migration in a Transwell assay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Pretreatment of mice for 6 hr with FTY720, a functional antagonist of S1pr1, greatly diminished in vivo Thy1-PE labeling on IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Similarly, in vivo Scart2 antibody labeling of V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>\u03b3\u03b4 T cells was decreased after FTY720 treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). FTY720 also decreased the CD169 membrane bleb positive fraction to 20\u201325% in both the total IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> population and the \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subpopulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The reductions in Thy1-PE-labeled cells (from ~10 to ~1%) and in CD169-bleb<sup>+</sup> cells (from ~35 to~25%) were similar, representing ~10% of the total IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> population in both cases (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), suggesting that the reduced frequency of CD169-bleb<sup>+</sup> cells was due to the loss of cells accessing the sinus. Comparable findings were made after treatment with the more selective S1pr1 functional antagonist, AUY954 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). These data provided evidence that S1pr1 was required for the cells to have normal access to the SCS. Examination of tissue sections by immunofluorescence microscopy showed a loss of Cxcr6<sup>GFP/+</sup> cells from the SCS following FTY720 treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). FTY720 treatment also caused a depletion of Scart2<sup>+</sup> cells from the SCS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When FTY720-treated mice were challenged with <i>S. aureus</i> bioparticles, the IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> population mounted an IL17 response of normal magnitude (not shown). We speculate that SCS access is needed for other types of responses."

This analysis required use of an unconjugated rat antibody to detect S1pr1. Since the Thy1-PE is a rat antibody, it was not possible to combine the S1pr1 stain with the in vivo Thy1-PE labeling procedure. To further test whether S1pr1 in innate-like lymphocytes was required for SCS access, S1pr1<sup>f/f</sup>\u00a0CreERt2<sup>+</sup> mice were bred. Tamoxifen treatment of adult mice for 5 days caused a loss of S1pr1 in innate-like lymphocytes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>). Analysis in separate mice showed that the loss of S1pr1 was associated with reduced in vivo Thy1-PE labeling and reduced CD169 on IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>). However, this approach could not exclude a role for S1pr1 in other cell types. Attempts to test the intrinsic role of S1pr1 using BM chimeras were unsuccessful due to difficulties in achieving efficient reconstitution of IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells and our finding that many of the cells developing in the chimeric mice appeared activated based on CD69 expression (not shown). In another approach, mice were treated with tamoxifen for a short time to cause a ~50% reduction in the fraction of cells that were S1pr1<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a>). We reasoned that if S1pr1 were acting cell intrinsically in IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells then under conditions of partial ablation the S1pr1-deleted cells should lose their CD169 association whereas this would not occur if the receptor were acting in another cell type. Consistent with an intrinsic role, there was little CD169 staining of S1pr1-negative cells in the tamoxifen-treated mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a>). These data support the conclusion that S1pr1 acts intrinsically in innate-like lymphocytes to promote close associations with SCS macrophages."

Innate-like lymphocytes express high levels of LFA1 (\u03b1L\u03b22) integrin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and ICAM1 is highly expressed by LECs lining the SCS (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). ICAM1 is also expressed by CD169<sup>+</sup> SCS macrophages (not shown). In adhesion assays, IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells bound avidly to ICAM1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The V\u03b34<sup>+</sup> subset had slightly lower LFA1 than the total IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> population and adhered less strongly to ICAM1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a>). Given these findings, we hypothesized that LFA1-ICAM1 interaction may have a role in innate-like lymphocyte movement from the SCS into the LN parenchyma. Consistent with this model, 6-hr \u03b1L blocking antibody treatment caused increased Thy1-PE labeling on total IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and on the V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>\u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset, without influencing their total number in the LN (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). A similar increase in the frequency of Thy1-PE labeled innate-like lymphocytes was observed in <i>Icam1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). However, <i>Icam1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice had less IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> and V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells compared with ICAM1 sufficient control mice, whereas the cells were present at an increased frequency in blood (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,G</a>). When mice were treated with \u03b1L blocking antibody for 3 days, there was a similar reduction in IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cell number in LNs and a marked increase in their numbers in blood (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These data indicate that, unlike short-term integrin blockade, long-term deficiency of ICAM1 or sustained blockade of LFA1 causes a loss of innate-like lymphocytes from the LN."

To further examine this possibility, intravital two photon microscopy was performed, comparing control and 6 hr \u03b1L blocked Cxcr6<sup>GFP/+</sup> mice. Visual inspection of the movies revealed many Cxcr6<sup>GFP/+</sup> cells that appeared to be \u2018stuck\u2019 to the SCS floor with their cell bodies \u2018fluttering\u2019 in the sinus, possibly being moved by passing lymph (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). These cells had an elongated morphology compared to the rounded shape of cells in the SCS of control mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Consistent with the in vivo Thy1-PE labeling and IF microscopy, quantitative analysis of the imaging experiments by enumerating cell tracks and by a computational approach revealed that \u03b1L treatment caused an increase of cells in the sinus in association with the macrophage layer (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Moreover, the cell tracking analysis showed that while there was not a significant change in the frequency of tracks crossing from the parenchyma into the SCS, there was a significant reduction in cells traveling from the SCS into the parenchyma (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K</a>). These data support the conclusion that LFA1-ICAM1-mediated adhesion is required for innate-like lymphocytes to migrate from the SCS into the LN parenchyma."

There was only a slight reduction in the total numbers of V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells after this short period (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) consistent with only a low fraction of the total population being in the sinus at a given time. These observations suggest that CD169 blockade caused a loss of cells in lymphatic sinuses and this in turn led to a loss of cells from the LN over time. A loss of V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells was also observed following CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophage ablation using CD169-DTR mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). In considering explanations for why these effects were mostly selective to the V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> subpopulation, we found it notable that in ICAM1 adhesion assays, V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells were less capable of binding ICAM1 compared with other innate-like lymphocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Taking this observation together with the finding that a higher fraction of V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells were lymph-exposed in the steady state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), we speculated that the non-\u03b3\u03b4T innate-like lymphocytes \u2013 but not the V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells \u2013 in the SCS were able to travel back into the LN parenchyma even in the absence of CD169."

Movement across the CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophage layer into the sinus is promoted by S1pr1 and lymphatic endothelial cell-derived S1P. Within the sinus CD169 on macrophages binds to sialylated ligands on the innate-like lymphocytes and helps prevent loss of the cells in lymph flow, with the V\u03b34+ subset of innate-like lymphocytes being most dependent on this adhesive system. LFA1 binding to ICAM1 also contributes to retaining innate-like lymphocytes in the sinus. Finally, return of cells to the parenchyma involves LFA1 and ICAM1, presumably to support transmigration across the lymphatic endothelium. Although this local migratory behavior was not essential for mounting IL17 responses against the pathogens tested in this study (data not shown), we propose that this surveillance program allows innate like lymphocytes to interrogate the CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages and SCS for pathogen- or commensal-derived molecules for which they have appropriate receptors."

Our findings add CCL20 as an additional homeostatic organizer, acting to recruit Ccr6<sup>+</sup> IL17-committed cells to the LN SCS region. As well as expression by innate-like lymphocytes, Ccr6 is abundant on Th17 cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Littman and Rudensky, 2010</a>) and we speculate that Th17 effector cells that remain in the LN following immunization or infection may position in proximity with the SCS. Although Cxcr6 is also abundantly expressed by innate-like lymphocytes, Cxcr6-deficiency did not appear to affect their distribution in the LN (unpubl. obs). The expression of CCL20 in a subcapsular region in primate LNs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Choi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pegu et al., 2007</a>) makes it likely that our findings with Ccr6 in mice will extend to humans. Ccr6 antagonism was suggested to reduce the egress of Ccr6<sup>+</sup> effector CD4 T cells from LNs in a mouse EAE model (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liston et al., 2009</a>). CCL20 can be strongly induced in inflamed tissue (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mabuchi et al., 2013</a>), and we speculate that under the inflammatory condition associated with EAE, CCL20 travels to LNs from the inflamed site and attracts Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells into the sinus lumen as we observed following CCL20 injection.

We describe here a further function for this ligand-receptor pair in promoting cell migration into the SCS. As for movement into cortical and medullary sinuses, this response involves S1P production by lymphatic endothelial cells. S1pr1 on naive lymphocytes is required during the egress commitment step and did not appear to have a role in promoting chemotaxis to the sinus (<a href=\"#bib29\">Grigorova et al., 2009</a>). Consistent with those findings, we did not observe an obvious effect of S1pr1 antagonism on innate-like lymphocyte density near the SCS, only a loss of cells from within the sinus. We therefore favor the model that the cells approach the sinus-lining lymphatic endothelial cells in a CCL20-dependent manner and S1pr1 commits some of the cells to cross the lymphatic endothelium (and associated CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophage layer) and enter the sinus. Within the sinus, we anticipate that the cells are exposed to high amounts of S1P that cause rapid, GRK2-dependent (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arnon et al., 2011</a>), internalization and desensitization of S1pr1, allowing the cells to respond to cues (possibly including CCL20) that can promote their return to the parenchyma. This type of shuttling behavior has been described in the spleen for another population of innate-like lymphocytes, the MZ B cells, with movement into the blood-rich MZ being S1pr1 dependent and return to the parenchyma being CXCL13 dependent (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arnon et al., 2013</a>). One function of MZ B cell shuttling is to deliver immune complexes from blood to B cell follicles (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cinamon et al., 2008</a>). It will be interesting to see if cell shuttling in LNs contributes to cargo delivery from lymph to the LN parenchyma."

We show that CD169 supports adhesion of innate-like lymphocytes in the sinus and helps restrain them against lymph flow. A number of in vitro studies have shown an ability of CD169 to support cell-cell adhesion (<a href=\"#bib14\">Crocker et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Crocker and Gordon, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">van den Berg et al., 2001</a>). Recent work has also revealed that CD169 on LN SCS macrophages can play a role in the capture of lymph-borne exosomes (<a href=\"#bib60\">Saunderson et al., 2014</a>) and retroviruses (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sewald et al., 2015</a>). The present work builds upon those observations to provide in vivo evidence that this Siglec family member can support shear stress-resistant adhesion of cells. Although lymph flow rates in the mouse popliteal LN have not been directly measured, a modeling study estimated wall shear stresses of several dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> in the SCS close to afferent lymphatic vessels (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jafarnejad et al., 2015</a>). These shear stresses are similar to those in blood vessels that support leukocyte adhesion (<a href=\"#bib22\">Finger et al., 1996</a>). A recent genomics study found that high endothelial venules in Peyer\u2019s patches highly express St6gal1, an enzyme that can generate ligands for CD22 (Siglec-2) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). In transfer experiments, CD22-deficient B cells showed reduced homing to Peyer\u2019s patches (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). CD22 also contributes to B cell homing to the bone marrow (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nitschke et al., 1999</a>). These studies together with our work provide evidence that Siglecs are a second class of lectin, after the selectins, that functions in mediating shear-resistant adhesion of cells. A key feature that facilitates selectin function is the high density of glycosylated ligands on the target cell and the very rapid on- and off-rates of lectin-ligand interactions (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rosen, 2004</a>). We suggest that similar features contribute to the function of CD169 as a shear-resistant adhesion receptor. The long ectodomain of CD169 (with 17 Ig-domains) also seems likely to contribute to an ability to \u2018capture\u2019 cells that have become dislodged by lymph flow and to allow their re-adhesion and subsequent transmigration. A similar activity may be involved in capturing CD169-ligand high cells arriving in the SCS from the afferent lymphatic."

These findings are in accord with the well-established roles of LFA1 and ICAM1 in supporting adhesion to and transmigration of lymphocytes across blood vessel endothelium into tissues (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rot and von Andrian, 2004</a>). However, they are in discord with a study showing that migration of BM-derived DCs from the SCS into the LN parenchyma was integrin independent (<a href=\"#bib39\">L\u00e4mmermann et al., 2008</a>). The basis for this discrepancy is not yet clear but might reflect general differences in the properties of lymphocytes and BM-derived DCs. Moreover, integrins may contribute to DC trafficking into LNs under conditions of inflammation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Teijeira et al., 2013</a>). Our conclusion that LFA1 and ICAM1 function during innate-like lymphocyte movement from the SCS into the LN parenchyma is based on four sets of observations in mice treated with \u03b1L blocking antibody: (1) innate-like lymphocytes transiently accumulate in the SCS; (2) the accumulated cells exhibit an unusual elongated morphology (suggesting a less adhesive state); (3) tracking analysis shows reduced numbers of cells migrating from the SCS into the parenchyma; (4) the cells are more sensitive to dislodgement by CD169 blocking antibody. We feel that the most parsimonious explanation for these data is that LFA1 supports adhesive interactions between innate-like lymphocytes and ICAM1<sup>+</sup> sinus-associated cells (lymphatic endothelial cells, macrophages) that are needed for movement into the parenchyma. However, given the heterogeneity of the innate-like lymphocyte population, we cannot exclude the possibility that LFA1 blockade also decreases retention of some cells within the LN parenchyma, thereby increasing their movement into the SCS. A study of naive lymphocyte egress from LNs showed that LFA1 and ICAM1 can contribute to promoting retention of cells in the LN and this was suggested to reflect a role for LFA1 in limiting the rate of cell movement across the endothelium into the sinus lumen (<a href=\"#bib55\">Reichardt et al., 2013</a>). More studies will be needed to fully address all the functions of LFA1 and ICAM1 in innate-like lymphocyte migration dynamics."

It presumably also ensures that signaling in the reverse direction, from the innate-like lymphocyte to the CD169<sup>+</sup> cells, can take place efficiently. Such signaling may serve to augment the antibacterial, antifungal or antiviral activities of the macrophages. The importance of cell movement into the lumen of the SCS is not yet clear but might allow prompt surveillance of pathogens and endogenous cells (e.g. cancer cells) arriving via the lymph, prior to their accessing the LN parenchyma. The greater CD169 coating of V\u03b34<sup>+</sup>\u03b3\u03b4T cells and their stronger dependence on CD169 for retention in the SCS than the other innate-like lymphocytes suggests these cells interact more strongly or in a more selective way with CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages. This likely reflects requirements for recognizing and responding to unique ligands beyond IL1\u03b2 and IL23."

These studies observed NK cell movement on collagen fibers and of NK cells slowing or stopping in contact with CD169<sup>+</sup> cells. Whether collagen fibers guide the movement of IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells needs further study, although in contrast to NK cells, the IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells had minimal expression of the collagen binding \u03b12 integrin (not shown and [<a href=\"#bib26\">Gray et al., 2012</a>]). Another distinction between these cell types is that LN NK cells lack Ccr6 (unpubl. obs). A previous study showed that NK1.1<sup>+</sup> cells in the LN are concentrated in medullary regions (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kastenm\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>), consistent with their homeostatic positioning being controlled by cues other than CCL20. NK cell movement to the SCS might occur in response to inflammation-induced chemoattractants such as CXCR3 ligands that can be upregulated in this region and function in recruiting activated CD4 T cells and CD8 central memory cells (<a href=\"#bib23\">Garcia et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Groom et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sung et al., 2012</a>). NKT cell interaction with SCS macrophages was observed following immunization with \u03b1-galactosylceramide (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barral et al., 2010</a>). Since 15\u201320% of the IL7R\u03b1<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> innate-like lymphocytes are NKT cells (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gray et al., 2012</a>), it is likely that these cells are continually surveying the SCS macrophages in a manner similar to the bulk Cxcr6<sup>+</sup> population studied here. As well as macrophages, there are DCs in the SCS region (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gerner et al., 2015</a>) and the migration behavior we describe may help ensure efficient surveillance of SCS-associated DCs. Following exposure to strong inflammatory signals, SCS macrophages move into the follicle (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gaya et al., 2015</a>). It will be interesting to examine how this reorganization modifies the innate-like lymphocyte trafficking behavior."

LN DN T cells highly express IL23R and respond to this cytokine (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mizui et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Riol-Blanco et al., 2010</a>). Our findings in ASC-deficient mice provide in vivo evidence that IL1-family cytokines are involved in activating the cells. These observations are reminiscent of findings for innate-like CD8 T cells in LNs that rapidly make IFN\u03b3 upon cytokine (IL18 and IL12 or IL18 and IFN\u03b1) stimulation, and for various types of memory T cells that make IFN\u03b3 upon IL12 and IL18 exposure (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jameson et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kastenm\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>).

Maintenance doses of intramuscular injections of 4 ml/kg\u00a0of xylazine (1 mg/ml) and ketamine (5 mg/ml) were given approximately every 30 min. To image the popliteal LN, the mouse\u2019s hind leg was immobilized using thermal putty to a Biotherm stage warmer at 37\u00b0C (Biogenics) for the duration of the surgery and subsequent imaging. A small incision was made directly behind the knee, and a ~0.5 cm square region of underlying tissue was exposed. The fat pad surrounding the popliteal LN was carefully dissected away without damaging surrounding vasculature and the afferent and efferent lymphatic vessels. After visualization of the popliteal LN, a 3D-printed plastic tissue mount was attached to the surrounding tissue using Vetbond. The tissue mount was immobilized with additional thermal putty, and the area above the LN was submerged in PBS for imaging. Images were acquired with ZEN2009 (Carl Zeiss,\u00a0Germany) using a 7\u00a0MP two-photon microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a Chameleon laser (Coherent). For video acquisition, a series of planes of 3 \u03bcm <i>z</i>-spacing spanning a depth of 90 \u03bcm were collected every 30 s. Excitation wavelengths were 905 nm. Emission filters were 500\u2013550 nm for GFP, 570\u2013640 nm for PE, and 450\u2013490 for second harmonic signal. Videos were made and analysed with Imaris 7.4.2 \u00d7\u00a064 (Bitplane). Two hours prior to all imaging experiments, 2\u00a0\u03bcg CD11b-PE or 3\u00a0\u03bcg MOMA1-TxRed antibody was injected through footpad. Cell tracking was performed using Imaris Bitplane software. Tracks generated using the software were manually confirmed and tracks that were a minimum of 5 min in duration were grouped according to whether they were exclusively in the parenchyma, exclusively in the SCS or crossed between compartments. Each movie contained a total of between 100\u2013300 tracks in the region of interest. Approximately 15% of the Imaris generated tracks could not be confirmed as representing the migration path of a single cell and these were excluded. To quantify the depth of cells from the LN capsule in the imaging data, we used a computational procedure. First, a surface object was created in Imaris over the LN capsule. The positions of both Cxcr6<sup>+</sup> cells and CD11b<sup>+</sup> subcapsular macrophages were determined using spots objects in Imaris. The minimum distance between each spot and the capsule was determined using a custom MATLAB (MathWorks) script and the ImarisXT interface. These data were exported into the R programming environment for analysis and plotting (ggplot2 package). The depth of the subcapsular sinus in individual LNs varied, and for each experiment was computationally determined as the peak frequency on a plot of CD11b<sup>+</sup> subcapsular macrophage\u2019s depth below the LN capsule, minus 2 \u00b5m, which agreed across experiments with visual estimates of the subcapsular sinus site. As the sinus size varied across experiments from 15\u00a0to\u00a040 \u00b5m, for the graphs of cell frequency against depth below the capsule the size of the sinus was normalized across experiments to 20 \u00b5m. Only the region within the sinus was normalized. Axis ratio was calculated as the ratio of ellipticity (prolate)/ellipticity (oblate). These dimensions were obtained by first creating a surface object for each cell using Imaris Bitplane software. Final videos were annotated and exported in Premiere (Adobe)."

The main findings are that CCR6-CCL20 attract ILL towards the SCS area, that the interaction of S1P1R1 with S1P1 mediates their egress into the SCS lumen, that the interaction of unidentified lectin-binding partners on ILL with CD169 on macrophages is important for their retention in the SCS and that the interaction of ILL LFA-1 with ICAM1 guides ILL out of the SCS and back to the LN parenchyma. Some of the major points emphasized by the authors are not novel (localization of ILL at the SCS for rapid pathogen encounter and pre-committed IL17 production by these ILL upon bacterial infection), having been established by the authors in previous studies or by other groups as cited and discussed. The main extension of previous findings involves the demonstration of a critical role for CCR6 in the localization of innate lymphocytes at the SCS and the provision of evidence that in the absence of CCR6 the innate T lymphocytes respond less well to bacterial challenge. These latter data provide some of the first direct evidence for a functional connection between micro-anatomical localization and functionality of lymphocytes regarding pathogen defense. While this relationship has been invoked as an interpretation of prior results, a direct demonstration of this relationship as provided here is important."

To our knowledge, this work is the first to show that this ILL population promptly produces IL17 in response to bacterial and fungal challenge; that ILLs move in and out of the SCS while remaining resident in the LN; and that this shuttling behavior requires S1PR1, CD169 and LFA1. Furthermore, we are not aware of any previous study showing that CD169 can function to support adhesion of cells under conditions of fluid flow and presumed exposure to shear stresses."

We find that there is a ~3-fold reduction in the fraction of KO cells that are proximal to the capsule versus more distant (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). We have replaced <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a> with a bi-lobed iLN as recommended.

This analysis revealed that \u03b1L treatment increased the fraction of tracks that were within the SCS. The 3-6 hr \u03b1L treatment did not cause a significant change in the fraction of tracks that crossed from the parenchyma into the sinus but it strongly reduced the fraction of tracks that returned from the SCS to the parenchyma (new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K</a>). These data provide support for the conclusion that LFA1 is required for efficient migration of ILL from the sinus into the parenchyma. However, we agree with the reviewers that we cannot exclude LFA1 also having a role on the parenchymal side and have revised the discussion of these data and now comment on how this finding differs from the findings made regarding requirements for BM-derived DCs to move from the sinus into the parenchyma."

These data are consistent with a role for LFA1 in mediating cell return from SCS to parenchyma, with gradual loss of the cells occurring over time due to lymph flow.
