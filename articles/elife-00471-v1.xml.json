We show here that Cas9 assembles with hybrid guide RNAs in human cells and can induce the formation of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) at a site complementary to the guide RNA sequence in genomic DNA. This cleavage activity requires both Cas9 and the complementary binding of the guide RNA. Experiments using extracts from transfected cells show that RNA expression and/or assembly into Cas9 is the limiting factor for Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage. In addition, we find that extension of the RNA sequence at the 3\u2032 end enhances DNA targeting activity in vivo. These results show that RNA-programmed genome editing is a facile strategy for introducing site-specific genetic changes in human cells."

We show here that Cas9 assembles with hybrid guide RNAs in human cells and can induce the formation of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) at a site complementary to the guide RNA sequence in genomic DNA. This cleavage activity requires both Cas9 and the complementary binding of the guide RNA. Experiments using extracts from transfected cells show that RNA expression and/or assembly into Cas9 is the limiting factor for Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage. In addition, we find that extension of the RNA sequence at the 3\u2032 end enhances DNA targeting activity in vivo. These results show that RNA-programmed genome editing is a facile strategy for introducing site-specific genetic changes in human cells."

The Type II CRISPR/Cas systems require a single protein, Cas9, to catalyze DNA cleavage (<a href=\"#bib10\">Sapranauskas et al., 2011</a>). Cas9 generates blunt DSBs at sites defined by a 20-nucleotide guide sequence contained within an associated CRISPR RNA (crRNA) transcript (<a href=\"#bib5\">Gasiunas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Jinek et al., 2012</a>). Cas9 requires both the guide crRNA and a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) that is partially complementary to the crRNA for site-specific DNA recognition and cleavage (<a href=\"#bib3\">Deltcheva et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Jinek et al., 2012</a>). Recent experiments showed that the crRNA:tracrRNA complex can be redesigned as a single transcript (single-guide RNA or sgRNA) encompassing the features required for both Cas9 binding and DNA target siterecognition (<a href=\"#bib6\">Jinek et al., 2012</a>). Using sgRNA, Cas9 can be programmed to cleave double-stranded DNA at any site defined by the guide RNA sequence and including a GG protospacer-adjacent (PAM) motif (<a href=\"#bib10\">Sapranauskas et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Jinek et al., 2012</a>). These findings suggested the exciting possibility that Cas9:sgRNA complexes might constitute a simple and versatile RNA-directed system for generating DSBs that could facilitate site-specific genome editing. However, it was not known whether such a bacterial system would function in eukaryotic cells."

Extension of the RNA sequence at its 3\u2032 end enhances DNA targeting activity in vivo. Further, experiments using extracts from transfected cells show that sgRNA assembly into Cas9 is the limiting factor for Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage. These results demonstrate the feasibility of RNA-programmed genome editing in human cells."

The CLTA genomic locus has previously been targeted and edited using ZFNs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Doyon et al., 2011</a>). We first tested the expression of a human-codon-optimized version of the <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> Cas9 protein and sgRNA in human HEK293T cells. The 160 kDa Cas9 protein was expressed as a fusion protein bearing an HA epitope, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and green fluorescent protein (GFP) attached to the C-terminus of Cas9 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Analysis of cells transfected with a vector encoding the GFP-fused Cas9 revealed abundant Cas9 expression and nuclear localization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Western blotting confirmed that the Cas9 protein is expressed largely intact in extracts from these cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To program Cas9, we expressed sgRNA bearing a 5\u2032-terminal 20-nucleotide sequence complementary to the target DNA sequence, and a 42-nucleotide 3\u2032-terminal stem loop structure required for Cas9 binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This 3\u2032-terminal sequence corresponds to the minimal stem-loop structure that has previously been used to program Cas9 in vitro (<a href=\"#bib6\">Jinek et al., 2012</a>). The expression of this sgRNA was driven by the human U6 (RNA polymerase III) promoter (<a href=\"#bib7\">Medina and Joshi, 1999</a>). Northern blotting analysis of RNA extracted from cells transfected with the U6 promoter-driven sgRNA plasmid expression vector showed that the sgRNA is indeed expressed, and that their stability is enhanced by the presence of Cas9 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

The rehybridized PCR products are incubated with the mismatch recognition endonuclease Cel-1 and resolved on an acrylamide gel to identify Cel-1 cleavage bands. As DNA repair by NHEJ is typically induced by a DSB, a positive signal in the Surveyor assay indicates that genomic DNA cleavage has occurred. Using this assay, we detected cleavage of the CLTA locus at a position targeted by the CLTA1 sgRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

However, robust plasmid cleavage was detected when the lysate was supplemented with in vitro transcribed CLTA1 sgRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Furthermore, lysate prepared from cells transfected with both Cas9 and sgRNA expression vectors supported plasmid cleavage, while lysates from cells transfected with the sgRNA-encoding vector alone did not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). These results suggest that a limiting factor for Cas9 function in human cells could be assembly with the sgRNA. We tested this possibility directly by analyzing plasmid cleavage in lysates from cells transfected as before in the presence and absence of added exogenous sgRNA. Notably, when exogenous sgRNA was added to lysate from cells transfected with both the Cas9 and sgRNA expression vectors, a substantial increase in DNA cleavage activity was observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Methods of modifying the genome exploit endogenous DNA repair pathways that are initiated by the introduction of site-specific dsDNA cleavages. The results presented here provide a straightforward system of RNA-guided site-specific dsDNA cleavage using the Cas9 protein from a Type II bacterial CRISPR system to promote genome editing in human cells. Our data show that a codon-optimized version of Cas9, when programmed by an appropriate sgRNA, successfully assembles into Cas9 targeting complexes to trigger site-specific DNA cleavage and repair by NHEJ. The efficiency of NHEJ-induced mutagenesis at the CLTA locus investigated here is consistently in the range of 6\u20138%. This frequency is lower than that found for a ZFN pair that recognizes a nearby target sequence, but is within the range of frequencies observed more generally with ZFNs and TALENs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bogdanove and Voytas, 2011</a>). Our data suggest that sgRNA expression and/or its assembly into Cas9, rather than Cas9 expression, localization or folding, presently limits Cas9 function in human cells. Higher efficiencies of Cas9-mediated genome targeting could be achieved by optimization of the sgRNA construct design, its expression levels or its subcellular localization. We note that the sgRNAs used in this study are not thought to be 5\u2032-capped or 3\u2032-polyadenylated, which may have reduced their stability in vivo<i>.</i> This and other 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end modifications might provide alternative approaches to enhancing Cas9:sgRNA assembly and activity in cells. Nonetheless, the levels of targeting observed in this study have been obtained with a minimal system that relies on simple base pairing to a guide RNA, in contrast to the ZFN and TALEN proteins, which require a new protein to be engineered for each new cleavage site. RNA-guided genome editing would thus offer distinct advantages due to the simplicity of the sgRNA design."

Although not tested explicitly in this study, a powerful feature of this system is the potential to program Cas9 with multiple sgRNAs in the same cell, either to increase the efficiency of targeting at a single locus, or as a means of targeting several loci simultaneously. Such strategies would find broad application in genome-wide experiments and large-scale research efforts such as the development of multigenic disease models. As an inexpensive and rapid mechanism for triggering site-specific genome modification, the programmable Cas9:sgRNA system could potentially transform next-generation genome-scale studies."

Mutations (indels) resulting from Cas9-induced DNA repair reactions were identified by Sanger sequencing of cloned amplicons. Briefly, the 360-bp PCR amplicon was treated with Taq DNA polymerase (NEB) and dATP to attach an \u2018A\u2019 base to the 3\u2032 end of the DNA fragment. The DNA was then ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transformants were grown on Luria Broth agar plates containing 100 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin, 70 \u03bcg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside and 100 \u03bcM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Random white colonies were selected for Sanger sequencing (Quintara Biosciences, Albany, CA). Representative DNA sequences are shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>."

This system could become a powerful alternative to protein-based targeting reagents, because it is based on simple Watson-Crick recognition and no protein design is required. To put this into perspective, the first proof-of concept study with zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) in human cells targeted plasmid, not chromosomal DNA."

In the present study, Jinek and colleagues advance this work by showing that Cas and guide RNAs expressed in mammalian cells can target an endogenous locus to induce DSBs. In addition, they improve on the guide RNA. Given the ease with which this system is programmed, it is not unlikely that even if its efficiency is lower than that of competing systems, it will come to supplant ZFNs and TALE Nucleases (TALENs). As such, the methods and results described in this manuscript will likely have a transformative impact in the field of genome engineering for human and many other species with complex genomes. We would be happy to publish this work once a few points have been clarified."

However, we note that the Surveyor assay is a well-established stand-alone method of detecting the presence of mutations introduced by NHEJ events as a consequence of double-stranded DNA breaks. For example, in a study that demonstrates improvements on the ZFN architecture for increased efficiency of gene editing, Miller et al. (An improved zinc-finger nuclease architecture for highly specific genome editing, <i>Nature Biotechnology</i>; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17603475\">PMID 17603475</a>) used solely the Surveyor assay to monitor genome modification. In a study showing improvements on methods to increase efficiency of genome editing, Doyon et al. (Transient cold shock enhances zinc-finger nuclease\u2013mediated gene disruption, <i>Nature Methods</i>; PMID 20436476) use only the Surveyor assay to show that subjecting cells to transient hypothermia can increase efficiencies of ZFN-induced gene disruption. A recent study by Miller et al. (A TALE nuclease architecture for efficient genome editing, <i>Nature Biotechnology</i>; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21179091\">PMID 21179091</a>), which was the first to demonstrate the use of TALENs for genome editing, relied solely on the Surveyor assay to demonstrate both NHEJ and homologous recombination at the CCR5 genomic locus, which comprised the majority of the article."
