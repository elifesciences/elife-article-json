Behavioral studies in humans have shown that changes in contextual features lead to overestimation of past durations. Based on evidence that the medial temporal lobes and prefrontal cortex represent contextual features, we related the degree of fMRI pattern change in these regions with people\u2019s subsequent duration estimates. After listening to a radio story in the scanner, participants were asked how much time had elapsed between pairs of clips from the story. Our ROI analyses found that duration estimates were correlated with the neural pattern distance between two clips at encoding in the right entorhinal cortex. Moreover, whole-brain searchlight analyses revealed a cluster spanning the right anterior temporal lobe. Our findings provide convergent support for the hypothesis that retrospective time judgments are driven by 'drift' in contextual representations supported by these regions."

Behavioral studies in humans have shown that changes in contextual features lead to overestimation of past durations. Based on evidence that the medial temporal lobes and prefrontal cortex represent contextual features, we related the degree of fMRI pattern change in these regions with people\u2019s subsequent duration estimates. After listening to a radio story in the scanner, participants were asked how much time had elapsed between pairs of clips from the story. Our ROI analyses found that duration estimates were correlated with the neural pattern distance between two clips at encoding in the right entorhinal cortex. Moreover, whole-brain searchlight analyses revealed a cluster spanning the right anterior temporal lobe. Our findings provide convergent support for the hypothesis that retrospective time judgments are driven by 'drift' in contextual representations supported by these regions."

Crucially, these theories posit that slowly-changing contextual features can be episodically associated with more quickly-changing aspects of the world (e.g., stimuli that appear at a particular moment in time; <a href=\"#bib72\">Mensink and Raaijmakers, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Howard and Kahana, 2002</a>)."

Thus, a slowly varying mental context could serve as a temporal tag (<a href=\"#bib78\">Polyn and Kahana, 2008</a>). In parallel, researchers in the domain of retrospective time estimation have shown that the degree of context change is a better predictor of duration judgments than alternative explanations, such as the number of items remembered from the interval (<a href=\"#bib10\">Block and Reed, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Block, 1990</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">1992</a>).

Second, since participants performed the temporal memory test after each encoding run, they were not entirely na\u00efve to the manipulation. Knowing that they would have to estimate durations between stimuli could have changed participants\u2019 strategy and enhanced their attention to time (for evidence that estimating time prospectively engages different mechanisms, see <a href=\"#bib53\">Hicks et al., 1976</a>, and <a href=\"#bib101\">Zakay\u00a0and\u00a0Block, 2004</a>).

The effect was significant in the right entorhinal cortex ROI. Extending the anatomical analysis to all masks in cortex revealed an additional effect in the left caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Moreover, whole-brain searchlight analyses yielded significant clusters spanning the right anterior temporal lobe.

The vast majority of fMRI studies of time estimation have used prospective tasks, in which participants are asked to deliberately track the duration of a short stimulus or compare the duration of two stimuli. Such studies have repeatedly shown that activity in the putamen, insula, inferior frontal cortex (frontal operculum), and inferior parietal cortex increases as participants pay more attention to the duration of stimuli, as opposed to another time-varying attribute (<a href=\"#bib31\">Coull, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Coull et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Livesey et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Wiener et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Wittmann et al., 2010</a>). <a href=\"#bib34\">Dirnberger et al.

Thus, our participants\u2019 duration estimates could correlate with the number of event boundaries, even if they were basing their estimates purely on the perceptual similarity between clips. To explore this possibility, we tested whether the number of event boundaries would correlate with duration estimates from na\u00efve participants, who could <i>only</i> judge temporal distance based on the similarity between clips, given that they had never heard the story."

Of course, we cannot definitively prove the null hypothesis that na\u00efve duration\u00a0estimates do not correlate with the number of event boundaries. However, the correlation between the number of boundaries and duration estimates was significantly higher for our original participants than for na\u00efve participants (<math id=\"inf1\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>f</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>=0.40, 95% CI [0.15 0.56]). In other words, duration estimates from participants who remembered the story were significantly more correlated with the number of contextual changes between two clips than duration estimates from participants who were judging temporal distance based merely on the similarity between the two clips. This suggests that the number of event boundaries carries information about temporal context that is not contained within the clips alone, and that our original participants\u2019 estimates were influenced by their memory of this contextual information."

Rather than capturing variance within an individual across intervals of the story, this analysis captures variance across individuals for a given interval of the story.

This analysis estimates population-level effects of interest, while controlling for the possibility of individual variability between subjects and between clip pairs. In other words, this approach leverages the power of the within-interval analysis to control for the objective content similarity between two clips, while also taking into account variability in the effect across participants. In addition, we included the mean duration estimates from our na\u00efve participants as a covariate in the model (see <i>Behavioral results</i>). Since na\u00efve participants had estimated the temporal distance between each pair of clips without hearing the story, this covariate is a further control for the inherent guessability of the temporal distance between two clips. Both controls strengthen our interpretation that the remaining effect of neural pattern distance on duration estimates is driven by the contextual dissimilarity (rather than perceptual or content dissimilarity) between two clips."

For the searchlight analyses, the data needed to be transformed to MNI space in order to aggregate the results; consequently, imperfections in alignment can reduce the significance of searchlight results in these regions. On the other hand, anatomical ROI analyses were performed entirely in native space, making them more suitable for idiosyncratically shaped regions."

(2) Since this analysis was performed on anatomical masks derived from FreeSurfer parcellation, they varied substantially in size. To ensure that differences in the speed of pattern change were not due to differences in ROI size, we also performed the multivariate procedure after regressing the vector of ROI sizes (number of voxels) out of the vector of FWHM values for each participant.

Rather than calculating the mean auto-correlation function of the pattern in every region, we calculated the auto-correlation function of every voxel\u2019s time course and averaged the auto-correlation functions across all the voxels in a given region.

Given that we were looking for a slow change in neural signal (unfolding over the entire course of the story), we thought that our high-pass filter might be removing this slow change; to address this possibility, we analyzed the unfiltered data. When we did this, we found that neural pattern change in the unfiltered data showed a consistent correlation in the <i>opposite</i> direction: almost all brain patterns changed more at the end of the story than at the beginning, including the CSF and white matter (<i>q</i>&lt;0.05, FDR), suggesting that a signal unrelated to neural processing, such as scanner drift or motion, may cause activity patterns to change more as time passes (see <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 11\u2014source data 1</a>). Thus, even if the degree of neural pattern change were decreasing over time, we might not be able to detect this effect, as it would have to overcome a global signal in the opposite direction that is not due to neural activity and that is present everywhere, including the CSF."

Medial entorhinal neurons also exhibited longer firing periods, which led the authors to propose that they could bind a series of hippocampal representations of distinct events (<a href=\"#bib64\">Lipton and Eichenbaum, 2008</a>). Thus, changes in distributed entorhinal activity patterns on the scale of minutes might represent changes in contextual elements that are later retrieved to make duration judgments (for theoretical discussion of the role of entorhinal cortex in contextual representation, see <a href=\"#bib56\">Howard et al., 2005</a>)."

After each run, participants were asked whether pairs of stimuli had occurred close together or far apart in time (all pairs were about 50 s apart). They found that neural pattern distance in the left hippocampus at the time of encoding was greater for pairs of stimuli later rated as 'far apart', though only when the stimuli were separated by a scene change. <a href=\"#bib74\">Noulhiane et al. (2007)</a> used a retrospective behavioral paradigm similar to ours in patients with unilateral MTL lesions. In that study, participants were asked to estimate the temporal distance between object pictures that had been randomly inserted into a silent documentary film. They found that the degree of left entorhinal, left perirhinal and left temporopolar cortex damage correlated with the degree to which patients overestimated minutes-long intervals in retrospect. (For related evidence from the animal literature, see <a href=\"#bib58\">Jacobs et al., 2013</a>, who showed that bilateral inactivation of the hippocampus impaired rats\u2019 ability to discriminate between similarly long durations, such as 8 and 12 minutes, but not between less similar intervals, such as 3 and 12 minutes.)"

Caudal ACC activity has been shown to increase in response to shifts in task contingencies (see <a href=\"#bib86\">Shenhav et al., 2013</a>, for a review) and there is converging evidence that ACC responses are important for adjusting behavior to unexpected changes by increasing attention and learning rate (<a href=\"#bib21\">Bryden et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Behrens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">McGuire et al., 2014</a>). <a href=\"#bib75\">O\u2019Reilly et al.

Although the present study was not designed to test such accounts, our findings are consistent with a role for ACC in updating predictive models. Events in the story that prompt participants to update their beliefs about the characters\u2019 situation are also likely to cause changes in cognitive context and therefore overestimation of duration. However, future studies are needed to test this interpretation, for instance by manipulating belief updating independently of surprise and measuring its effect on retrospective duration estimates."

This variability was significantly correlated with changes in BOLD activity patterns in the right anterior temporal lobe, particularly the right entorhinal cortex, between the start and end of each interval. Control experiments demonstrated that duration estimates were strongly driven by contextual boundaries and that the relationship between neural distance and behavior still held when we controlled for the perceptual\u00a0and\u00a0semantic similarity of the clips. Our findings suggest that patterns of activity in these regions might encode contextual information that participants can later retrieve to infer the durations of intervals on the scale of minutes. Additional work is needed to assess how these regions contribute to representing particular contextual features (such as physical environment, abstract task states, and emotional states) and whether changes in each of these features affect retrospective duration estimates differently."

Therefore, instead of the FreeSurfer MTL masks, we used a probabilistic MTL atlas developed by <a href=\"#bib54\">Hindy and Turk-Browne (2015)</a>. MTL regions, including perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal cortex were defined probabilistically in MNI space, based on a database of manual MTL segmentations from a separate set of 24 participants.

Thus, we were faced with the challenge of preserving slower components of the BOLD signal that reflect neural activity, while removing low-frequency components attributable to non-neuronal noise, including scanner drift and physiological noise (such as low-frequency respiratory variation and heart rate variation). Physiological noise (and a substantial component of scanner noise) was factored out using the residualization procedure described above.

This analysis relies on the idea that, when participants listen to the same story or watch the same film, the signal in brain regions processing the story is highly correlated across participants (<a href=\"#bib48\">Hasson et al., 2004</a>). While such correlations should not be present in CSF or white matter, spurious inter-subject correlations in these regions can arise due to low-frequency noise. In addition, listening to the same story could induce correlated motion across participants, but these correlations would also be present in CSF and white matter. Thus, we searched for a high-pass filter that could remove nonspecific correlations in CSF and white matter, while preserving correlations in brain regions known to be important for processing the stimulus.

In order to meaningfully measure distances between neural patterns that are 360\u2009s apart, the Nyquist theorem suggests we would need a high-pass filter cut-off of 720\u2009s or larger. However, plotting ISC as a function of high-pass filter (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>) showed that a cut-off like 720\u2009s was not able to remove inter-subject correlations in the CSF, which remained of the same magnitude as those in some grey matter regions.

It is possible that participants would invoke different retrieval strategies in such cases (for instance, they might base their duration estimates purely on the content of the clips, without recollecting their context). It is also possible that such estimates could be random guesses. To filter out guesses, we used the confidence ratings collected after the time perception test, in which participants rated how well they could remember when in the story each individual clip had occurred. Specifically, we located the participant\u2019s confidence for the two clips delimiting each temporal interval, and took the smaller of the two ratings as the confidence for that interval. We performed the main analysis relating neural drift to time estimation only on high-confidence intervals, removing pairs of clips with the lowest confidence. Since participants calibrated their confidence ratings differently (some were more prone to rate their confidence as 4/5, while others were more prone to rate it as 2/5), we picked the confidence threshold for each participant that removed at least 33% of the intervals with the lowest confidence, while preserving at least 33% of the intervals with the highest confidence. Our behavioral analysis (see <i>Behavioral\u00a0results</i>) shows that participants\u2019 duration estimates were significantly more accurate for high-confidence intervals than when all intervals were included."

Since this analysis is performed within intervals, it ensures that story content is held constant across participants, such that differences in pattern distances and duration estimates are due to individual differences only. To ensure that pattern distances and duration estimates were comparable across participants, all vectors were z-scored within participants.

Since such rich models often fail to converge or approach singularity given typical psychological datasets (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bates et al., 2015a</a>), we imposed a weak Wishart prior on the group covariances, which regularizes the model away from singularity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Chung et al., 2015</a>). This weak, boundary-avoiding prior on our random effects covariance structure regularizes the model towards simpler random effects structures unless the data suggests otherwise (<a href=\"#bib28\">Chung et al., 2015</a>). All models converged under this prior. This fitting procedure was implemented using the R package blme (<a href=\"#bib29\">Chung et al., 2013</a>), which extends the lme4 package (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bates et al., 2015b</a>) and performs maximum-a-posteriori estimation of linear mixed-effects models."

(As for our main analysis, the BOLD time course of every voxel was smoothed using a moving average filter of 5 TRs.

Imagine that the participants were played audio clips from a radio drama and asked to judge how far apart they were in the show. Let's say for one pair of clips both have the sound of the ocean in the background and the same speakers speaking. The other pair of clips does not sound alike---different people are speaking in different locations. Which of these pairs would be judged to be closer in time? Now, insofar as an aspect of brain activity measures any property of the clips (power spectrum, semantic content, etc), we would readily expect that brain activity to correctly categorize the pairs of clips. But this is certainly not a memory effect as by construction, there is no actual memory for anything. This account seems to naturally account for the finding that many many brain regions show a tendency towards a correlation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), although most of them do not reach significance."

There appears to be no attempt to characterize what features of the story drive this effect. Moreover, it is unclear how much such features may produce the effect of neural dissimilarity correlating with greater distance judgments. For instance, if two clips with two different sets of characters are rated as further apart that two clips with the same set of characters, the regions that show dissimilarity scaling with subjective duration may be those sensitive specifically to characters rather than context more broadly. Thus an alternate explanation for their results is that the regions that show their effect are just sensitive to the content of the story that can produce both neural dissimilarity and greater duration ratings. The authors should discuss/examine this alternative."

Even better if you can argue it would have to be so small it couldn't account for the correlation between the experimental judgments and the drift. There are also fancy ways to approach this (e.g., Bayesian inference).

Real world stimuli that unfold in time are autocorrelated over just about every time scale. Compounding the problem, it is impossible to measure the similarity on all relevant dimensions. This revision makes a substantive attempt to argue against the perceptual hypothesis, there are two behavioral controls that attempt to address the question of whether the results attributed to contextual change could be driven by perceptual effects. To summarize my reaction to the revision, while the controls make for a stronger case than the previous submission, I am not convinced that these controls address the concern in a satisfactory way. I suggest additional analyses with the existing data that could clarify this point. If this concern were resolved (which is not at all clear) the manuscript would result in a very nice contribution."

This allows a rough estimate of the change in context between the two clips. Indeed the number of event boundaries predicted duration judgments by the original participants. The assumption seems to be that there is no perceptual/semantic similarity across event boundaries, but is not an assumption that I can accept. Imagine a story where Alice and Betty have a discussion at the beach. Then there's an event boundary and Alice and Betty move to the coffee shop. Then there's another event boundary as Alice leaves and Betty and Chris have a conversation in the coffee shop. The number of event boundaries correlates with the overlap of perceptual/semantic features present in the scene. More broadly, if the perceptual/semantic content is autocorrelated over long time scales (and it almost surely is) and if event boundaries are a proxy for abrupt drops in the autocorrelation, then number of event boundaries really ought to predict perceptual/semantic similarity of the available features. So this control is not at all convincing."

There is no evidence that their ratings correspond to the number of event boundaries between the clips. The suggestion is that because number of event boundaries indexes contextual change (but not presumably perceptual/semantic similarity), the null result requires us to accept that there is no difference in the similarity of the two clips. Leaving aside for a moment the issue of asking the reader to accept the null (which is a really serious problem!), this is kind of an indirect test of what we're really after. The finding is that duration judgments of the fMRI subjects correlate with number of event boundaries whereas the judgments of the naive controls do not correlate with number of event boundaries. Why not just ask whether the judgments of the fMRI subjects correlate with the judgments of the naive subjects? If they do, then there is no way to argue that the change in the multivoxel signal is due to contextual drift per se. It might be possible to partial out the effect attributable to the naive subjects' judgments. If there is not a correlation, then the authors still have to successfully argue for the null, but it's at least a clean and direct (and much more sensitive!) test of the question of interest."

They show that the number of event boundaries experienced in between the test stimuli also modulated distance judgments.

We show that individual differences in neural pattern change for a given pair of clips correlate with individual differences in duration estimates in the right entorhinal cortex and right pars orbitalis, as well as other regions that had been sub-threshold in our main analysis. Thus, pattern change in these regions correlates with duration estimates even when the perceptual and semantic content of the two clips is held constant. If neural pattern change were being driven by story content, we would have expected the effect to be larger for the across-interval, within-participants analysis (where story content differed across intervals) than for the across-participants, within- interval version of the analysis (where story content is held constant).

Moreover, it is unclear how much such features may produce the effect of neural dissimilarity correlating with greater distance judgments. For instance, if two clips with two different sets of characters are rated as further apart that two clips with the same set of characters, the regions that show dissimilarity scaling with subjective duration may be those sensitive specifically to characters rather than context more broadly.

The behavioral controls suggest that the number of event boundaries between two clips is a strong driver of duration estimates (but only for participants who have heard the story), and may be the reason why duration estimates are so consistent across participants. We also present a new neural analysis showing that all of the regions we found display a significant correlation between neural pattern dissimilarity and duration estimates across participants for a given pair of clips, in other words, even when the (objective) content of the story is held constant."

The number of event boundaries correlates with the overlap of perceptual/semantic features present in the scene. More broadly, if the perceptual/semantic content is autocorrelated over long time scales (and it almost surely is) and if event boundaries are a proxy for abrupt drops in the autocorrelation, then number of event boundaries really ought to predict perceptual/semantic similarity of the available features.

The finding is that duration judgments of the fMRI subjects correlate with number of event boundaries whereas the judgments of the naive controls do not correlate with number of event boundaries. Why not just ask whether the judgments of the fMRI subjects correlate with the judgments of the naive subjects? If they do, then there is no way to argue that the change in the multivoxel signal is due to contextual drift per se. It might be possible to partial out the effect attributable to the naive subjects' judgments.

We then correlated the negative of the error (our measure of accuracy) with the activity of each brain voxel at encoding. We found highly significant clusters in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (replicating the above report), as well as the medial prefrontal cortex, and slightly sub-threshold clusters in the medial parietal (precuneus and retrosplenial) and left superior temporal gyrus (<a href=\"#fig14\">Author response image 1</a>, left panel, blue clusters). Thus, it seems that the linear regression procedure mattered for the final results."

It is possible that this network is particularly important for encoding the temporal context of stimuli that are part of a narrative (Chen et al., 2015), but that another strategy is used when the stimuli whose timing is recalled were not related to one another."

However, please note that it is not necessarily surprising that our multivariate analyses (which constitute the bulk of the manuscript) reveal different results from this univariate analysis, given that the behavioral tests used are different. In the bulk of the manuscript, we relate multivariate pattern change to duration estimates, where participants explicitly estimated the relative distance between two clips. On the other hand, the univariate analysis leverages data from a separate behavioral test where participants placed each clip, individually, on the timeline of the story (not a comparison between two clips)."
