                    "text": "In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) the large motoneurons that innervate the fast-contracting muscle fibers (F-type motoneurons) are vulnerable and degenerate in adulthood. In contrast, the small motoneurons that innervate the slow-contracting fibers (S-type motoneurons) are resistant and do not degenerate. Intrinsic hyperexcitability of F-type motoneurons during early postnatal development has long been hypothesized to contribute to neural degeneration in the adult. Here, we performed a critical test of this hypothesis by recording from identified F- and S-type motoneurons in the superoxide dismutase-1 mutant G93A (mSOD1), a mouse model of ALS at a neonatal age when early pathophysiological changes are observed. Contrary to the standard hypothesis, excitability of F-type motoneurons was unchanged in the mutant mice. Surprisingly, the S-type motoneurons of mSDO1 mice did display intrinsic hyperexcitability (lower rheobase, hyperpolarized spiking threshold). As S-type motoneurons are resistant in ALS, we conclude that early intrinsic hyperexcitability does not contribute to motoneuron degeneration."

In contrast, the small motoneurons that innervate the slow-contracting fibers (S-type motoneurons) are resistant and do not degenerate. Intrinsic hyperexcitability of F-type motoneurons during early postnatal development has long been hypothesized to contribute to neural degeneration in the adult. Here, we performed a critical test of this hypothesis by recording from identified F- and S-type motoneurons in the superoxide dismutase-1 mutant G93A (mSOD1), a mouse model of ALS at a neonatal age when early pathophysiological changes are observed. Contrary to the standard hypothesis, excitability of F-type motoneurons was unchanged in the mutant mice. Surprisingly, the S-type motoneurons of mSDO1 mice did display intrinsic hyperexcitability (lower rheobase, hyperpolarized spiking threshold). As S-type motoneurons are resistant in ALS, we conclude that early intrinsic hyperexcitability does not contribute to motoneuron degeneration."

Intrinsic hyperexcitability of motoneurons, which increases discharge probability and thereby calcium inflow, has been assumed to participate in the excitotoxic process (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ilieva et al., 2009</a>). However, it was recently suggested that hyperexcitability improves motoneuron survival (<a href=\"#bib43\">Saxena et al., 2013</a>). Regardless of its effect, it is still not clear whether spinal motoneurons are hyperexcitable in mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) mice, a standard model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Indeed, changes in excitability occur very early in mSOD1 mice (<a href=\"#bib16\">Elbasiouny et al., 2010</a>). Motoneurons from mSOD1 embryos recorded in culture are hyperexcitable (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pieri et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kuo et al., 2005</a>): they are recruited at lower current and display higher F\u2013I gain. Similarly, <a href=\"#bib33\">Martin et al. (2013)</a> found, in an in vitro preparation of mSOD1 embryonic cord, that motoneurons are also hyperexcitable: their dendritic tree is reduced causing an increase in input resistance. Investigations in neonates have led to contradictory results. Hypoglossal motoneurons were reported to be hyperexcitable (F\u2013I gain is increased, <a href=\"#bib52\">van Zundert et al., 2008</a>). However, <a href=\"#bib38\">Pambo\u2013Pambo et al. (2009)</a> did not observe any change in spinal motoneuron input resistance, rheobase, or stationary gain suggesting that their excitability was unchanged. In the same line, <a href=\"#bib41\">Quinlan et al. (2011)</a> found that the excitability of spinal motoneurons is homeostatically maintained despite an increase in their input conductance (recruitment current and F\u2013I gain unchanged). In contrast, <a href=\"#bib3\">Bories et al. (2007)</a> reported a decrease in input resistance causing the spinal motoneurons to be hypoexcitable."

Until now, however, the fact that the motor unit population is heterogeneous, even in neonates (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jansen and Flatby, 1990</a>), has never been taken into account. Motoneurons innervate different types of muscle fibers and display different patterns of discharge during the second post-natal week both in rats (<a href=\"#bib42\">Russier et al., 2003</a>) and in mice (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pambo\u2013Pambo et al., 2009</a>). Indeed, for liminal current pulses, the discharge starts at the pulse onset in some motoneurons (<i>immediate firing</i> pattern) but is delayed in others (<i>delayed firing</i> pattern). Here, we provide electrical, morphological and molecular evidence that immediate firing spinal motoneurons innervate slow-contracting fibers (S-type motoneurons) whereas delayed firing motoneurons innervate fast-contracting fibers (F-type motoneurons). We then investigated whether these two populations are equally affected in neonatal mSOD1 mice. We show that this is not the case: only the immediate firing motoneurons are hyperexcitable. Their rheobase is decreased because of a more hyperpolarized voltage threshold for spiking. In sharp contrast, the excitability of the delayed firing motoneurons is unchanged. Since the F-type motoneurons are vulnerable in ALS whereas the S-type motoneurons are resistant (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pun et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hegedus et al., 2008</a>), the remarkably selective intrinsic hyperexcitality of S-type motoneurons in neonates indicates that intrinsic hyperexcitability is not an early event that triggers degeneration of the motoneurons."

In the example of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A1</a>, the motoneuron did not fire at the onset of a 1.6 nA square pulse. Instead the motoneuron depolarized slowly and started to fire only 2.9 s after the pulse onset when the membrane potential reached the voltage threshold for spiking (\u221235 mV, dashed line). Once the firing started, its frequency increased. This motoneuron displayed the <i>delayed firing</i> pattern. A very important feature of this pattern is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The delay was long at rheobase (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) but it progressively decreased (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>) to finally disappear (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) as the current intensity increased. 63 out of 94 WT motoneurons (67%) exhibited this <i>delayed firing</i> pattern. The remaining motoneurons displayed the so-called <i>immediate firing</i> pattern: at rheobase, the motoneuron discharged at the pulse onset without any delay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A2</a>). In the immediate firing pattern, the spiking frequency remained constant with little variability. 31 out of the 94 WT motoneurons (i.e., 33%) displayed the immediate firing pattern."

We filled motoneurons with neurobiotin in order to investigate the dendritic tree architecture. Only the dendrites that remained in the slice plane were considered for analysis (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In these conditions, the number of primary dendrites (and thereby dendritic trees) per motoneuron is similar in immediate and delayed firing motoneurons (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). This allows us to make relevant morphological comparisons on the reconstructed trees. As exemplified in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, the dendritic arborization extends further in delayed firing motoneurons than in immediate firing motoneurons (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C2</a>). In WT mice, delayed firing motoneurons have on average more branching points (44 \u00b1 14, 26 to 72, N = 14) compared to the immediate firing motoneurons (27 \u00b1 13, 13 to 52, N = 10, p = 0.007), larger total dendritic length and longer dendritic paths than immediate firing motoneurons (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

First, the soma sizes (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) of both immediate and delayed firing motoneurons are in the range of alpha motoneurons (see supplemental data in <a href=\"#bib18\">Friese et al. (2009)</a> for the soma size distribution of alpha and gamma-motoneurons in P14 mice). Note, however, that on average, immediate firing motoneurons have smaller soma areas than delayed firing motoneurons (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Second, since alpha-motoneurons, but not gamma-motoneurons, receive monosynaptic Ia inputs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eccles et al., 1960</a>), we checked whether immediate and delayed firing motoneurons receive such proprioceptive inputs. We recorded motoneurons, characterized their discharge pattern and filled them with neurobiotin. Subsequently, we stained the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGlut1) since VGlut1 is expressed in terminals from primary afferents but not in terminals from excitatory interneurons or descending fibers (<a href=\"#bib37\">Oliveira et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Friese et al., 2009</a>). VGlut1 afferents are known to innervate not only alpha-motoneurons but also Renshaw cells in the neonate (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mentis et al., 2006</a>). However, since we identified the labelled cells as motoneurons on the basis of antidromic action potential recordings, we are confident that VGlut1 terminals shown on <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> are apposed on alpha-motoneurons and not on Renshaw cells. We observed that both delayed and immediate firing motoneurons received proprioceptive terminals on the soma and proximal dendrites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, arrows in insets). Third, we checked for the expression of the neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN), a known marker for alpha-motoneurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Friese et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shneider et al., 2009</a>).

Conversely, chondrolectin (Chodl) is expressed in a fraction of F-type motoneurons but not in S-type motoneurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Enjin et al., 2010</a>). We therefore tested the expression of these two molecular markers on immediate and delayed firing motoneurons. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> shows an immediate firing motoneuron expressing Err\u03b2 and a delayed firing motoneuron that did not. Remarkably, all 6 investigated immediate firing motoneurons proved to be Err\u03b2-positive whereas all 8 delayed firing motoneurons were Err\u03b2-negative. This molecular distinction matches with differences in the electrical properties (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In situ hybridization allowed us to investigate whether immediate and delayed firing motoneurons expressed Chodl mRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). None of the 9 investigated immediate firing motoneurons did. 7 out of the 15 investigated delayed firing motoneurons were Chodl-positive whereas the remaining 8 were Chodl-negative. Altogether, the immediate firing motoneurons were all Err\u03b2-positive and Chodl-negative as expected for S-type. On the other hand, the delayed firing motoneurons were all Err\u03b2-negative and about half of them were Chodl-positive whereas the other half were chondrolectine-negative as expected for F-type motoneurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Enjin et al., 2010</a>).

(2014)</a> recently showed that the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) is strongly expressed in motoneurons that are the most vulnerable to ALS, that is, those of the large, fast contracting and fatigable (FF) motor units. Conversely, the most resistant motoneurons, that is, those that innervate the slow contracting fibers, were devoid of MMP9. We therefore investigated whether MMP9 was expressed in delayed and immediate firing motoneurons. All 5 investigated immediate firing motoneurons were MMP9 negative (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, first row). In contrast, 5 out of the 10 investigated delayed firing motoneurons displayed a strong MMP9 labelling (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, second row). Four other delayed firing motoneurons did not express MMP9 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, third row) and one was weakly labelled. The delayed firing motoneurons that express MMP9 tend to exhibit the largest input conductances and rheobases (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) suggesting that they innervate the largest motor units. These results indicate that the immediate firing motoneurons are resistant during ALS, in keeping with our identification as S-type motoneurons."

As expected, the rheobase, that is, a measure of cell excitability, increases with input conductance (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). However, in immediate firing motoneurons, the slope of the linear regressions is significantly smaller in mSOD1 mice than in WT mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B2</a>, 15 vs 22 mV <i>t</i> test p = 0.04, Chow test p = 0.0004). This is not the case for delayed firing motoneurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B1</a>, 19 vs 22 mV, <i>t</i> test p = 0.5, Chow test p = 0.2). On average the rheobase of immediate firing motoneurons is two times smaller in mSOD1 mice compared to WT mice (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). On the other hand, the rheobase of delayed firing motoneurons is not significantly affected in mSOD1 mice (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). However, the resting membrane potential of immediate firing motoneurons is unchanged in mSOD1 mice (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The decrease in rheobase in mSOD1 immediate firing motoneurons is instead due to an hyperpolarization of the voltage threshold for spiking (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Accordingly, the difference between the voltage threshold for spiking and the resting membrane potential is smaller for the immediate firing motoneurons in mSOD1 mice (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). As a consequence, a smaller amount of current is required to reach the voltage threshold for spiking in these motoneurons. Motoneuron excitability was also assessed on the basis of their responses to slow triangular ramps of current (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The current at which the first action potential was fired (recruitment current) during a slow ramp is indeed another way to measure the rheobase. The recruitment current on the slow ramps was very close to the rheobase measured using the current pulses (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), and again, it was significantly smaller in mSOD1 mice only in the immediate firing motoneurons. Regardless of the way we measured the rheobase (long pulses or slow ramps) we found that the immediate firing motoneurons, but not the delayed firing ones, are hyperexcitable in mSOD1 mice."

                                "text": "We have previously shown that mixed mode oscillations (MMOs) are related to the excitability state of motoneurons (<a href=\"#bib21\">Iglesias et al., 2011</a>). MMOs are small oscillations of the membrane potentials between full action potentials (arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Manuel et al., 2009</a>). They create variability in the firing discharge. In most cases they are present only at low current intensity, defining a sub-primary firing range (<a href=\"#bib31\">Manuel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Turkin et al., 2010</a>). We have shown in a previous study (<a href=\"#bib21\">Iglesias et al., 2011</a>) that MMOs are caused by a relative deficit of sodium current with respect to potassium current, which is due to a slow sodium inactivation. MMOs therefore reflect a low excitability state. In the case of the delayed firing motoneurons, MMOs were observed nearly in all cells (49 out of 50) recorded in WT animals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A1</a>) and in all 31 mSOD1 motoneurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A2</a>). This is again an indication that their exitability is unaltered by the mutation. In the case of the immediate firing motoneurons, MMOs are encountered in nearly all WT motoneurons (13 out of 15, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B1</a>) but they are absent in most mSOD1 motoneurons (MMOs are lacking in 8 out of 11 mSOD1 immediate firing motoneurons, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B2</a>). The proportion of immediate firing motoneurons exhibiting MMOs in mSOD1 is thus significantly reduced compared to WT motoneurons (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.003). The absence of MMOs in the immediate firing motoneurons of mSOD1 mice further indicates that these motoneurons are more excitable than in WT mice."

First, immediate and delayed firing motoneurons are alpha-motoneurons and not gamma-motoneurons, since both of them receive proprioceptive inputs (VGlut1 contacts), express NeuN and have soma sizes in the alpha-motoneuron range (<a href=\"#bib18\">Friese et al., 2009</a>). Second, the immediate firing motoneurons express Err\u03b2 but not Chodl as expected for S-type motoneurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Enjin et al., 2010</a>). Conversely, the delayed firing motoneurons do not express Err\u03b2 and those likely to innervate the largest fast-contracting motor units express Chodl as seen by <a href=\"#bib17\">Enjin et al. (2010)</a>. Third, delayed firing motoneurons display, on average, larger input conductances, higher rheobases, and shorter AHPs than the immediate firing ones. This is in keeping with the electrical differences that have been observed between F-type and S-type motoneurons in adult cats (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burke, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zengel et al., 1985</a>), rats (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beaumont and Gardiner, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Button et al., 2006</a>) and mice (<a href=\"#bib30\">Manuel and Heckman, 2011</a>).

This was probably due to the fact that these studies used pulses of much shorter duration to elicit firing. Indeed, in the delayed firing motoneurons, the long latency of the first spike is only apparent on long-lasting stationary current pulses close to the rheobase (no spike would have been visible with this current intensity if a shorter pulse duration would have been used). If the pulses are short, higher current intensities are required to make the neuron fire, and the first action potential is fired with a shorter delay after the pulse onset. When the current was large enough, the discharge started shortly after the current onset (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, since a slow current contribute to the delayed of firing (<a href=\"#bib29\">Leroy et al., SfN abstract 2012</a>), long intervals are needed to allow it to recover their initial state before the next pulse. A rapid repetition of the test pulses might prevent the observation of the delayed firing. However, spinal motoneurons with a delayed discharge have been observed in <a href=\"#bib38\">Pambo\u2013Pambo et al. (2009)</a> who carefully checked the current intensity at which the motoneurons start to fire in response to a 0.5 s square pulse (see also <a href=\"#bib42\">Russier et al. (2003)</a> for abducens motoneurons). Nonetheless, in these studies the latency of the first action potential was substantially shorter than in the present study, likely because the intensity to bring the cell to fire was slightly higher than the one that would have been required for a 5 s pulse duration. It is noteworthy that <a href=\"#bib38\">Pambo\u2013Pambo et al. (2009)</a> observed similar proportions of the two firing patterns."

Since many morphological and electrophysiological properties differ between these two populations, the statistics for each property (average values, standard deviations) are heavily dependent on the proportion of immediate and delayed firing motoneurons present in each sample. If these proportions differ substantially in the WT and mSOD1 samples, this might obfuscate the conclusions. Therefore, one must be careful to separate these two motoneuron subtypes when comparing electrical and morphological properties between WT and mSOD1 neonatal mice."

Indeed, the input conductance remains unchanged despite a reduction of the dendritic length of the mSOD1 immediate firing motoneurons. The relatively large overall size of the motoneuron dendritic tree in the second postnatal week probably limits the influence that morphological alterations have on the input conductance (<a href=\"#bib16\">Elbasiouny et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore the reduction in dendritic length could be compensated by a decrease of the specific membrane resistivity. The average 5 mV hyperpolarization of the voltage threshold for spiking likely accounts for the reduction of the rheobase and thereby the intrinsic hyperexcitability of mSOD1 immediate firing motoneurons. <a href=\"#bib41\">Quinlan et al. (2011)</a> observed an increase in the sodium persistent inward current in mSOD1 motoneurons during the second post-natal week. This increase in sodium persistent current can account for both the disappearance of MMOs and the hyperpolarization of the voltage threshold for spiking (<a href=\"#bib21\">Iglesias et al., 2011</a>). In a modeling study, <a href=\"#bib13\">Dai et al. (2002)</a> showed that spiking threshold hyperpolarization occurs when the sodium conductance increases or when the activation curve of the sodium channels is shifted toward hyperpolarized levels. They report that this effect on the spiking threshold occurs without changes in amplitude and width of action potentials, as in the present study. To a lesser extent, a reduction of the delayed rectifier conductance or a depolarization of its activation curve may also hyperpolarize the spiking voltage threshold (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dai et al., 2002</a>)."

These two currents make the F-type motoneurons less excitable than the S-type motoneurons in neonates. Moreover, it is possible that these two currents prevent the spiking threshold to be hyperpolarized and thereby the rheobase to be decreased in mSOD1 neonates. However the delayed firing pattern is transient and disappears with age (<a href=\"#bib42\">Russier et al., 2003</a>).

Numerical simulations suggest that the decrease in input conductance is due to a shortening of the terminal segments of embryonic spinal motoneurons which are much more electrotonically compact than in neonates (<a href=\"#bib33\">Martin et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, in spinal muscular atrophy, another motoneuron degenerative disease, spinal motoneurons also become hyperexcitable (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mentis et al., 2011</a>).

Alterations in both the inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs impinging on mSOD1 motoneurons, as well as the properties of their postsynaptic receptors, have been reported in cultured motoneurons derived from embryos (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carunchio et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chang and Martin, 2011</a>) as well as in motoneurons from neonates (<a href=\"#bib52\">van Zundert et al., 2008</a>) and adults (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jiang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sunico et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wootz et al., 2013</a>). It has been shown that, during a critical developmental period, the morphology of the dendritic tree deeply relies on the synaptic activity received by the dendrites (<a href=\"#bib46\">Spitzer, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cline and Haas, 2008</a>). More synaptic inputs can lead to a shortening of the dendrites (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tripodi et al., 2008</a>). Such structural homeostatic response of the motoneurons might counterbalance the increase in synaptic activity to ensure that an appropriate level of input is achieved (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tripodi et al., 2008</a>). The change in voltage threshold might also be a homeostatic regulation in response to synaptic hyperactivity. Since the frequency of both excitatory and synaptic spontaneous events are increased in early stages (<a href=\"#bib52\">van Zundert et al., 2008</a>), it is possible that the net input to S-type motoneurons is shifted towards more inhibition. An excess of inhibition at early age might be compensated by the hyperpolarization of the voltage threshold that increases the motoneuron excitability. As suggested by <a href=\"#bib52\">van Zundert et al. (2008)</a> synaptic hyperactivity, dendritic shrinkage and intrinsic hyperexcitability might well be causally linked. The differential impact of the disease on the dendritic morphology of our two subpopulations of motoneurons suggests that synaptic alterations might be restricted to one subtype of motoneurons. Demonstrating this point will require, however, a preparation in which it is possible to preserve the integrity of spinal networks and identify the subtype of recorded motoneurons."

                                "text": "In mSOD1 mice, degeneration of the neuromuscular junctions of F-type motor units does not start before P50 whereas the S-type motor units do not degenerate (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pun et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hegedus et al., 2008</a>). We may wonder whether the morphological and electrophysiological changes that we have observed perinatally in S-type motoneurons have a long term impact in adulthood and whether these early changes contribute to the survival of S-type motoneurons. The specific dendritic shrinkage of S-type motoneuron increases the size difference between S- and F- types motoneurons, and it has most likely a beneficial effect on S-type motoneurons. Indeed the smaller the total membrane surface, the smaller the metabolic demand to maintain this surface. Given the fact that motoneurons cope to an energetic issue in ALS that is caused by a disruption of the mitochondrial function (<a href=\"#bib54\">von Lewinski and Keller, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ilieva et al., 2009</a>), a lesser energetic demand may increase their chance to survive. Specific hyperexcitability of S-type motoneurons might also contribute to motoneuron survival as recently suggested (<a href=\"#bib43\">Saxena et al., 2013</a>). One might question whether an early hyperexcitability of S type motoneurons has a long-term benefit on their survival or whether the hyperexcitability has an impact only if it is still present in adults. We do not know whether S-type motoneurons remain hyperexcitable in adults. However, the whole population of adult spinal motoneurons are, on average, not hyperexcitable just prior to the onset of neuromuscular junctions degeneration (<a href=\"#bib14\">Delestree et al., 2014</a>). Some of them even turn out to be hypoexcitable since they lose the capacity to discharge repetitively in response to stationary inputs. However, in <a href=\"#bib14\">Delestree et al. (2014)</a>, S-type motoneurons (which represent only a small fraction of motoneurons) and F-type motoneurons were pooled together and the possibility that S-type motoneurons remain hyperexcitable in adults cannot be ruled out. Unlike neonates, adult S-type and F-type motoneurons cannot be distinguished on the basis of their discharge pattern. Only highly demanding in vivo experiments would allow distinguishing motor unit sub-types on the basis of their contractile properties. A selective intrinsic hyperexcitability of S-type motoneurons that persists in adults would strongly reinforce the assumption that hyperexcitability contributes by itself to the protection of these motoneurons."

Input conductance was the inverse of the slope of the I-V curve obtained by injecting small 500 ms pulses of currents (\u2212100 pA to +20 pA, 30 pA steps repeated 10 times). The rheobase was searched by applying a series of 5 s square pulses of increasing intensity. The time between the end of a pulse to the beginning of the following one was 20 s. This long interval allowed the slow currents to recover their initial state before the next pulse. Given this long interval interpulse we had to limit the number of pulses tested. The pulse intensity was increased, by 50 pA steps, from 0 to the intensity that elicits the firing of at least one action potential. However when the rheobase was higher than 0.9 nA, the steps were increased to 100 pA. This step searching protocol made it hard to systematicaly measure the exact value of current required to elicit only a single action potential and we would often transition from a sub-threshold response to a train of action potentials between two consecutives steps. This minimal current that elicited the cell firing (a single potential or a train) was therefore considered as the rheobase. We also measured the recruitment current for which the first action potential was fired during a 0.1 nA/s current ramp (average of three trials). Note that the recruitment currents are very similar to the rheobases assessed with the pulses (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We measured the voltage spiking threshold on the first spike of the 5 s pulses as the voltage for which the first derivative value went over 10 mV/ms. Single action potentials were elicited by 1 ms square pulses (1\u201310 nA). Their height, width at half-amplitude as well as the relaxation time constant of their AHP were measured on the average of 30 successive trials. The relaxation time constant of the AHP was determined using a mono-exponential fit."

The <i>Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov</i> bilateral test was used to compare distributions in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. The slopes of the linear regressions of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a> were compared with the use of a <i>t</i> test, after verification that the residues of the regressions were normally distributed (<i>Shapiro\u2013Wilk</i> tests). Further verification using <i>Chow</i> test (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chow, 1960</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Studinger et al., 2007</a>) led to the same results. The regressions of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> were constrained to a null intercept (to satisfy the law I = G.U where I is the rheobase, G the input conductance and U, the slope of the regression has the dimension of a voltage). U is close to the mean of \u0394V = (V<sub>threshold for spiking</sub> \u2212 V<sub>rest</sub>) for the immediate firing motoneurons but not for the delayed firing ones. Indeed, for the delayed firing motoneurons, the membrane potential is depolarized during the long pulses. As a result V<sub>threshold</sub> for the first spike is more depolarized than it would have been if the firing had occurred at the pulse onset. Accordingly, U is smaller than the mean of \u0394V for the delayed firing motoneurons. All tests and analysis were undertaken with R (<a href=\"#bib49\">Team RC, 2013</a>) version 3.0.2 and the real statistics Excel resource pack (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zaiontz, 2014</a>). Data in the text and tables are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD with the range and the number of observations. Source data can be found in the <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>."

A prevailing hypothesis that has been suggested from experiments in numerous previous studies is that early motor neuron hyperexcitability invariably causes late motor degeneration in ALS. Despite the attractive logic of this hypothesis, all of these studies suffer from a potentially fundamental shortcoming; that recordings have not distinguished between slow and fast motor neurons. Slow motor neurons innervating slow contracting muscle fibers are much more resistant to degeneration than motor neurons innervating fast contracting muscle fibers during development of ALS. Thus, the ability to distinguish slow and fast motor neurons during intracellular recordings has represented an acute and pressing problem that has been solved in the present study. In the present study the authors take advantage of electrophysiological, molecular and anatomical techniques to identify slow and fast motor neurons in young wild type mice and mSOD1 mice. The data provide compelling evidence that slow and fast motor neurons can be distinguished in both groups of mice. The results demonstrate a clear and marked change in the excitability of motor neurons in mSOD1 mice that depends on motor neuron type. However, surprisingly the excitability of motor neurons innervating fast contracting muscle fibers does not change. In contrast the excitability of motor neurons innervating slow contracting muscle fibers increases. Unlike previous studies of motor neurons in ALS models the study links the motor excitability to the different subtypes of motor neurons. The study, therefore, provides a significant advance. Despite the study's significant merits there are a number of issues that need to be considered as outlined below: 1) From the Introduction section: The observation of \u201cdelayed firing\u201d in approximately two thirds of wild type motor neurons is surprising and puzzling. Previous reports have only described the \u201cimmediate\u201d type of firing (Fulton and Walton, 1986; Vinay et al, 2000; Pflieger et al, 2002; Miles et al, 2005) or delayed firing that is less pronounced (Pampo-Pambo et al.). Are these differences caused by a sampling bias, do they have to do with the place of sampling, or do they reflect the real relationship between the numbers of fast and slow motor neurons in the spinal cord at this age? A much better and in depth discussion of this finding with relationship to previous literature is needed; in particular a discussion of how the firing feature is causally related to hyperexcitability which may imply that the hyperexcitability of these cells also is transient and may disappear with age."

Was there any difference between wild type and ALS motor neurons? This information is needed to assess the two populations. Furthermore, the criteria for selection of motor neurons are set to a resting potential at -65mV or lower. The study by Pambo-Pambo and colleagues (2009) reported that ALS motor neurons exhibited elevated resting potential (-55mV) compared to wild type motor neurons. Is it possible that the authors in the present study might have excluded a significant proportion of ALS motor neurons from their study by setting too stringent criteria?

The authors do not provide any information, either in terms of recordings or in the manuscript how precisely this analysis was performed. This clarification has a significant weight in the interpretation of the results and the authors should state the method they have used. The discussion about primary range and sub-primary range is very confusing for a person who is not familiar with the terminology and it should be clarified in the text. Moreover the relevance of the mixed mode oscillations in the context of motor neuron pathology is unclear and a better discussion of this phenomenon is needed."

This variability in parameters is large compared with other previous work and the authors should provide an explanation. Is it possible that the slicing procedure may be responsible for this variability since a large extent of the motor neuron dendritic tree is compromised? Of course it is also possible that previous studies under-reported their variability, but this issue needs to be confronted."

However this difference in the rheobases of slow motor neurons is only apparent for motor neurons with input conductances greater than 40 nS.

This might be apparent by performing a regression analysis of the data to determine directly the 'relationship' between rheobase and input conductance and thereby expand the present analysis."

We made a new Figure (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) to make the point clearer. In the delayed firing motoneurons, upon injection of rheobase current, the first spike appeared at the end of the pulse with a long delay (no spike would have been visible with this current intensity if a shorter pulse duration would have been used). However the delay decreased when the current intensity increased. When the current was large enough the discharge started shortly after the current onset. These explanations have now been added in the first paragraph of the Results section and in the Material and methods section explaining with greater details how we measured the rheobase. The Discussion section was expanded to explain that the delayed firing pattern might have been overlooked if the current intensity is too high. In addition, since slow inactivating currents contribute to the delayed firing (Leroy et al. SfN abstract 2012), long intervals are needed between successive test pulses to allow these slow currents to recover their initial state before the next pulse. A rapid repetition of the test pulses might prevent the apparition of the delayed firing. Finally, as now discussed, we suggest that <a href=\"#bib35\">Pambo-Pambo et al. (2009)</a> have shorter delays than in the present work because they were using shorter pulse duration that required slightly higher current to elicit firing in that time window. It is noteworthy that <a href=\"#bib35\">Pambo-Pambo et al.

However the delayed firing pattern is transient and disappears in adults (<a href=\"#bib39\">Russier et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Manuel et al., 2009</a>).

This was achieved because we had to wait 20 seconds between two successive pulses in order to allow the slow currents to recover their initial state (if we have been using shorter intervals between the pulses we would have missed the delayed firing pattern) and this long interpulse duration prevents us to make too many sweeps. However, we have been sometime able to find the current that elicited a single action potential as in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>. In other cases the motoneuron fired a train. In addition we also assessed the rheobase on slow ramps of currents (recruitment current). In this case the current intensity was continuously increasing and we measured the current (recruitment current) at which the motoneuron fired the first spike. The recruitment current is another way to measure the rheobase, and in fact lead to the same results as with the current pulses (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

Indeed it has already been demonstrated that MMOs are caused by a low excitability state due to a slow inactivation of the sodium current that induces a relative deficit of sodium current with respect to potassium (<a href=\"#bib20\">Iglesias et al. 2011</a>). Here we demonstrated that the immediate firing motoneurons are largely lacking MMOs in mSOD1 mice whereas there are present in WT mice. This further demonstrates that the excitability of immediate firing motoneurons has increased in WT mice. In sharp contrast delayed firing motoneurons display MMOs both in mSOD1 and WT mice indicating again an unchanged excitability. The last paragraph of the Results was fully rewritten to explain this issue."

Such an increase of sodium persistent current can account both for the disappearance of the MMOs and for the hyperpolarization of the spiking voltage threshold as we previously shown (Iglesias et al). This is now stated in the Discussion section \u201cOrigin of the intrinsic excitability\u2026\u201d Moreover, we explain later on during the Discussion that this change in voltage threshold might be a homeostatic regulation in response to synaptic hyperactivity. Since the frequency of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic spontaneous events are increased in early stages (Van Zundert et al. 2008), it is possible that the net input to S-type motoneurons is shifted towards more inhibition. An excess of inhibition at early age might be compensated by the hyperpolarization of the voltage threshold that increases the motoneuron excitability. In our study, we witness dendritic shrinking and intrinsic hyperexcitability, this opens the possibility that they result from an increase in synaptic activity. As suggested by Van Zundert et al.
