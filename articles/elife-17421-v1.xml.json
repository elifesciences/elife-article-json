Two alternative mechanisms have been discussed in the literature so far: preferred direction enhancement, by which responses are amplified when stimuli move along the preferred direction of the cell, and null direction suppression, where one signal inhibits the response to the subsequent one when stimuli move along the opposite, i.e. null direction. Along the processing chain in the <i>Drosophila</i> optic lobe, directional responses first appear in T4 and T5 cells. Visually stimulating sequences of individual columns in the optic lobe with a telescope while recording from single T4 neurons, we find both mechanisms at work implemented in different sub-regions of the receptive field. This finding explains the high degree of directional selectivity found already in the fly\u2019s primary motion-sensing neurons and marks an important step in our understanding of elementary motion detection."

Two alternative mechanisms have been discussed in the literature so far: preferred direction enhancement, by which responses are amplified when stimuli move along the preferred direction of the cell, and null direction suppression, where one signal inhibits the response to the subsequent one when stimuli move along the opposite, i.e. null direction. Along the processing chain in the <i>Drosophila</i> optic lobe, directional responses first appear in T4 and T5 cells. Visually stimulating sequences of individual columns in the optic lobe with a telescope while recording from single T4 neurons, we find both mechanisms at work implemented in different sub-regions of the receptive field. This finding explains the high degree of directional selectivity found already in the fly\u2019s primary motion-sensing neurons and marks an important step in our understanding of elementary motion detection."

In both models, the information about the changing light levels hitting two light-sensitive cells at two points on the eye are compared across time. In one model, signals from images moving in a cell\u2019s preferred direction become amplified. In the other model, signals moving in the unfavored direction become canceled out. However, neither model perfectly explains motion vision."

In the experiments, both models were tested in tiny fruit flies by measuring the activity of the first nerve cells that respond to the direction of visual motion. While each mechanism alone only produces a fairly weak and error-prone signal of direction, together the two mechanisms produce a stronger and more precise directional signal. Further research is now needed to determine which individual neurons amplify or cancel the signals to achieve such a high degree of direction selectivity."

Photoreceptors send their axons into the optic lobe, which consists of four consecutive layers of neuropil called lamina, medulla, lobula and lobula plate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Each neuropil layer is made up of retinotopically organized columns together containing roughly 100 different neurons per column (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</a>). Within the optic lobe, visual motion information is extracted in parallel pathways encoding light increments (ON) and decrements (OFF) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Joesch et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Eichner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Joesch et al., 2013</a>). Both pathways bifurcate in the lamina and lead, via a set of specific medulla interneurons, onto the dendrites of T4 and T5 cells, respectively (<a href=\"#bib30\">Takemura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Shinomiya et al., 2014</a>). Both T4 and T5 cells exist in 4 subgroups tuned to one of the four cardinal directions of motion and project into four layers of the lobula plate (<a href=\"#bib18\">Maisak et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). There, they form monosynaptic cholinergic excitatory connections with the dendrites of the\u00a0large-field lobula plate tangential cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mauss et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Schnell et al., 2012</a>)\u00a0as well as with lobula plate intrinsic neurons. These intrinsic neurons, in turn, inhibit tangential cells in the adjacent layer (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mauss et al., 2015</a>). Since none of the neurons upstream from T4 and T5 respond to visual motion in a direction-selective way (<a href=\"#bib3\">Behnia et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Strother et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Meier et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ammer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Serbe et al., 2016</a>),\u00a0T4 and T5 cells are the first neurons in the processing chain where directional information is represented explicitly (<a href=\"#bib18\">Maisak et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fisher et al., 2015</a>)."

To address this question, we constructed a simple algorithmic model of a motion detector (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). In this model, the motion detector receives 3 inputs. A central direct input (D)\u00a0is flanked by two low-pass filtered inputs: one enhancing input (E) implementing a multiplicative and one suppressing input (S) implementing a divisive non-linearity. This way, the detector is designed to combine a preferred direction enhancement on one and a null direction suppression on the other side within a single motion-sensing unit. Testing the model with single pulses, responses were only detected for positions \u22121 and 0 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, left). Stimulating the model with 2-pulse-sequences at positions \u22121 and 0 led to pronounced preferred direction enhancement but no null direction suppression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, top 2 rows). When the 2-pulse-sequences were delivered at positions 0 and 1, no pronounced preferred direction enhancement occurred, but null direction suppression was substantial (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, bottom 2 rows). Thus, these simulation results qualitatively match the respective experimental data (compare with <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure\u00a03a and b</a>). We next simulated an array of such units and calculated its responses to grating motion at different speeds and directions. We found that the model exhibits a high degree of directional selectivity over a broad range of velocities, with little responses to null direction motion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>, middle left). In contrast, the model without null direction suppression revealed substantial null direction responses almost as large as its preferred direction responses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>, middle center). The same was true for a model with no preferred direction enhancement (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>, middle right). Interestingly, no such qualitative differences were observed at the level of a model tangential cell, i.e. after subtraction of opponent units (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>, bottom). When we simulated the responses of the model to grating motion into different directions, we found the full model T4 cell to be more sharply tuned to its preferred direction than the one without preferred direction enhancement or the one without null direction suppression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). We conclude that combining preferred direction enhancement with null direction suppression leads to a strong direction selectivity of the primary motion-sensing unit."

When stimulating the cells with 1\u2009Hz grating motion at various directions, we found a rather sharp directional tuning with about 90\u00b0 half-width around its preferred direction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g</a> in <a href=\"#bib18\">Maisak et al., 2013</a>).

Both models lead to weakly direction-selective signals in the first place, which, in the Hassenstein-Reichardt model, are improved downstream by subtraction of oppositely tuned components (for review, see <a href=\"#bib4\">Borst and Helmstaedter, 2015</a>. Surprisingly, however, a high degree of directional selectivity is found already at the first stage where directional responses are observed, i.e. in T4 and T5 cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Maisak et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This can now be explained by the fact that both preferred direction enhancement and null direction suppression are implemented in T4 cells. While the output of the full Hassenstein-Reichardt-correlator after the subtraction stage shows a high degree of directional\u00a0selectivity in the absence of null-direction suppression, the relatively small differences between large, but poorly tuned signals (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>, middle panel) would be highly prone to noise. Improving the direction-tuning already at the level of the half-detectors by the additional null-direction suppression increases robustness to noise and might in addition be energetically less costly."

Stimuli were presented with 3\u20135 repetitions per experiment in a randomized fashion. All stimuli were presented in full contrast. To measure the directional and temporal frequency tuning, square-wave gratings with a spatial wavelength of 24\u00b0 spanning the full extent of the stimulus arena were used. For the direction tuning those gratings were moved in 12 directions separated by 30\u00b0 at a temporal frequency of 1\u2009Hz. To determine the temporal frequency tuning, gratings were moved at temporal frequencies ranging 0.05 to 20\u2009Hz moving in the preferred and null direction. For the apparent motion experiments, either large (180\u00b0 wide \u00d7 4.5\u00b0 high) or small (4.5 \u00d7 3\u00b0) bright horizontal bars were presented for 400 ms either in isolation (flicker) or in sequences of 2 pulses (apparent motion) offset by 4.5\u00b0 in the preferred or null direction with a \u2206t, onset to onset, of 400 ms.</a>"

The\u00a0time courses of relative fluorescence changes (\u0394F/F) were calculated from the raw imaging sequence. Responses to the stimulus were baseline-subtracted, averaged across repetitions, and quantified as the peak responses over the stimulus epochs. For T4 cells, the baseline was determined during one second before the stimulus, for L2 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), it was determined during the last second before luminance off-set. Those responses were averaged across experiments. Where indicated, responses were normalized to the maximum average response before averaging. For the apparent motion experiments, non-linear response components were calculated as the differences of the time-courses of the responses to the apparent motion stimuli and the sum of the appropriately time-shifted responses to flicker stimuli at the corresponding positions."

The signal amplitude ranged from 0 to 1. The input to the ON pathway, as represented by lamina neuron L1, was modeled as previously described (<a href=\"#bib9\">Eichner et al., 2011</a>). Briefly, the local luminance signal was high-pass-filtered (1st order, \u03c4\u00a0=\u00a0250 ms), and 10% of the DC value was added with subsequent rectification. The T4 cell was then modeled as receiving input from three adjacent columns (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>): an enhancing signal E at position \u22121, representing the low-pass filtered signal of L1 (1st order, \u03c4\u00a0=\u00a0250 ms), a direct signal D at position 0 which is identical to L1, and a suppressing signal S again representing the low-pass filtered signal of L1 (1st order, \u03c4\u00a0=\u00a0250 ms). The response was calculated as the product of E and D, divided by S. Signals had the following weights k: k<sub>E</sub> = 5, k<sub>D</sub> = 5, k<sub>S</sub> = 10. To avoid division by zero and to account for flicker responses, a DC term of 1.0 was added to each signal. To simulate flicker and apparent motion stimuli (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>), light pulses of 450 ms length and amplitude 1.0 were delivered to selected columns and the response of an individual model T4 cell was evaluated. To simulate the responses to sine-gratings (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c,d</a>), responses were calculated either as the summed responses of an array of such units (\u2018T4 response\u2019) or after subtracting the signals of oppositely tuned T4 cells (\u2018VS response\u2019). Simulations without null direction suppression or preferred direction enhancement were performed by setting either k<sub>E</sub> or k<sub>S</sub> to zero. Software was written in the\u00a0Python programming language and is available as source code."

They follow up their findings in a simple model, which in addition predicts that the 2 mechanisms in tandem yield a sharper spatial tuning than any one mechanism alone.

In both the vertebrate retina and in the early visual system of flies, this computation has been studied in the framework of two classic models of visual motion direction: the Hassenstein-Reichardt (H-R) model and the Barlow-Levick (B-L) model. Mechanistically, both rely on combining input from spatially offset pathways, with input from an adjacent location temporally delayed relative to the central pathway. One (H-R) produces an excitatory \"preferred-direction\" (PD) response by multiplication with temporally delayed input from a preceding location, while the other (B-L) uses division by input from a temporally delayed location in the \"null direction\" (ND). Direct evidence for the latter has been obtained in direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSRGCs), where starburst amacrine cells provide the appropriate ND inhibition. In the <i>Drosophila</i> optic lobe, the H-R model has thus far been the mechanism most often proposed for direction selectivity for large field motion, with information from \"ON\" and \"OFF\" motion pathways represented by so-called T4 and T5 cells respectively being combined in vertical system (VS) and horizontal system (HS) lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs). Recent anatomical and electron microscopy (EM) evidence has suggested a more complex picture at the level of the input to T4 and T5 neurons \u2013 their inputs comprise more cell types than previously believed. In this study, the authors use precise optical stimulation that takes into account the fly's neural superposition eye (Franceschini, 1975) along with two-photon calcium imaging to suggest that B-L-like inhibition may combine with H-R like excitation to shape the responses of T4 neurons. The results are interesting but the evidence provided is indirect and the picture still somewhat murky. Detailed comments follow."

However, this claim, which is highlighted in the abstract, goes beyond the evidence presented, which is entirely based on recordings in T4 axons. Unless the authors can present direct anatomical and physiological evidence for such localized dendritic input, I would suggest that this claim be removed or significantly tempered and moved to Discussion."

What is shown instead is supra- or sub-linear summation upon sequential (PD vs ND) excitation of successive lamina columns. Why does this have to necessarily result from inhibition in T4 dendrites rather than have presynaptic origins? While it is true that medulla neurons are not known to be sensitive to motion-direction, such neurons are known to have suppressed responses to bars wider than their receptive field (T5 input neurons for OFF pathway; Serbe et al., 2016 from the Borst lab), so might a skewed sampling of such inputs by T4 perhaps confer the observed ND suppression?"

This seems never to be observed in the experiments shown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a,b</a>). What is seen instead is sub-linearity (or supra-linearity), which the authors call a non-linear response component. Is this a calcium indicator limitation even with the higher-baseline GCaMP6m? If there is inhibition, might it be easier to pick up directly in the dendrites of single T4 neuron or do the authors find this experimentally infeasible?"

In the manuscript (introduction section), these responses are described as 'negligible', but they seem to reach 50% of peak responses. This requires further discussion, because the study's results rely heavily on the high precision of optical illumination. If the responses reflect the limits of the illumination system, it would be useful to discuss how that might affect the interpretation of results. Also, on the same note, it would be great to see what a 'standard' localized stimulus presentation (i.e., targeting single ommatidia and sequences of ommatidia without using the telescopic refinement) would evoke in T4 neurons. This would highlight the importance of telescopic stimulus presentation for visual motion studies, which would be useful to the field."

In both the vertebrate retina and in the early visual system of flies, this computation has been studied in the framework of two classic models of visual motion direction: the Hassenstein-Reichardt (H-R) model and the Barlow-Levick (B-L) model. Mechanistically, both rely on combining input from spatially offset pathways, with input from an adjacent location temporally delayed relative to the central pathway. One (H-R) produces an excitatory \"preferred-direction\" (PD) response by multiplication with temporally delayed input from a preceding location, while the other (B-L) uses division by input from a temporally delayed location in the \"null direction\" (ND). Direct evidence for the latter has been obtained in direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSRGCs), where starburst amacrine cells provide the appropriate ND inhibition. In the Drosophila optic lobe, the H-R model has thus far been the mechanism most often proposed for direction selectivity for large field motion, with information from \"ON\" and \"OFF\" motion pathways represented by so-called T4 and T5 cells respectively being combined in vertical system (VS) and horizontal system (HS) lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs). Recent anatomical and electron microscopy (EM) evidence has suggested a more complex picture at the level of the input to T4 and T5 neurons \u2013 their inputs comprise more cell types than previously believed. In this study, the authors use precise optical stimulation that takes into account the fly's neural superposition eye (Franceschini, 1975) along with two-photon calcium imaging to suggest that B-L-like inhibition may combine with H-R like excitation to shape the responses of T4 neurons. The results are interesting but the evidence provided is indirect and the picture still somewhat murky. Detailed comments follow.</i>"
