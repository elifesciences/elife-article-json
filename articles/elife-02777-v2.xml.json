                    "text": "Enzymes can increase the rate of biomolecular reactions by several orders of magnitude. Although the steps of substrate capture and product release are essential in the enzymatic process, complete atomic-level descriptions of these steps are difficult to obtain because of the transient nature of the intermediate conformations, which makes them largely inaccessible to standard structure determination methods. We describe here the determination of the structure of a low-population intermediate in the product release process by human lysozyme through a combination of NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. We validate this structure by rationally designing two mutations, the first engineered to destabilise the intermediate and the second to stabilise it, thus slowing down or speeding up, respectively, product release. These results illustrate how product release by an enzyme can be facilitated by the presence of a metastable intermediate with transient weak interactions between the enzyme and product."

Although the steps of substrate capture and product release are essential in the enzymatic process, complete atomic-level descriptions of these steps are difficult to obtain because of the transient nature of the intermediate conformations, which makes them largely inaccessible to standard structure determination methods. We describe here the determination of the structure of a low-population intermediate in the product release process by human lysozyme through a combination of NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. We validate this structure by rationally designing two mutations, the first engineered to destabilise the intermediate and the second to stabilise it, thus slowing down or speeding up, respectively, product release. These results illustrate how product release by an enzyme can be facilitated by the presence of a metastable intermediate with transient weak interactions between the enzyme and product."

Protein intermediates are involved in folding, misfolding, and aggregation processes, as well as in events associated with molecular recognition, catalysis, and allostery (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dobson, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sekhar and Kay, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Tzeng and Kalodimos, 2013</a>).

In the second step, the transition state of the reaction is reached within the favourable environment provided by the catalytic site enabling the conversion of the substrate into product. In the third step, which is often rate-limiting, the product is released and the enzyme returns to its original state. Each of these steps is usually rather complex and involves reaction intermediates, which are transient in nature and difficult to characterise."

The native structure of this enzyme is divided into a \u03b1 domain (residues 1 to 38, and 86 to 130) and \u03b2 domain (residues 39 to 85), containing primarily \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-sheet secondary structures, respectively (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blake et al., 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Phillips, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Artymiuk and Blake, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Radford et al., 1992</a>). This enzyme degrades bacterial cell walls by catalysing the hydrolysis of the 1,4-\u03b2-linkages of the cell wall peptidoglycans, with a reaction that has been the object of intense scrutiny (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chipman and Sharon, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Warshel and Levitt, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Post et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Vocadlo et al., 2001</a>). According to the mechanism originally proposed by Phillips on the basis of his structure (<a href=\"#bib36\">Phillips, 1967</a>), lysozyme binds to a peptidoglycan molecule in the binding site within the cleft between its two domains thus causing the substrate to adopt a strained conformation similar to that of the transition state of the hydrolysis. Here, we study the product release process. To this end, we used a well-characterised oligosaccharide product having an inhibitory effect on the enzyme, N,N',N\u201c-triacetylchitotriose (triNAG) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Turner and Howell, 1995</a>), which has been frequently used for studying lysozyme\u2013product interactions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Post et al., 1986</a>)."

A comparison between the locked and unlocked conformations indicates that this difference corresponds to specific interactions between the substrate and the binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), which include hydrophobic interactions between a methyl group of triNAG and the side-chain of W109, as well as hydrogen bonds between the ligand and the main chain amide group of N60 and the side chains of W64 and Q104. These interactions are present in essentially all the structures in the ensemble representing the locked state, while they are absent in the structures in the ensemble of the unlocked state. Indeed, because of a partial displacement of the ligand from the binding pocket, the unlocked conformations lose the tight interactions that are stabilised in the locked state and gain new interactions on the external surface of the protein. These interactions, which mainly involve hydrogen bonds between donor and acceptor groups from the ligand and the protein surface, are highly variable and heterogeneous in the unlocked conformations."

This transition is favoured by large-scale conformational motions in which the \u03b1 and \u03b2 domains become closer, thus suggesting that these motions are employed by the enzyme to modulate the affinity with the ligand. The unlocked state therefore represents an intermediate state for product release. In this view (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), the enzyme product complex (EP) populates transiently an intermediate state (EP*) that favours the release of the product (E + P). Thus, the analysis of the structural ensembles that we have determined provides evidence that large-scale conformational transitions are employed by enzymes along their catalytic cycles including key events in the product release step, which often represents the rate-limiting step that governs the turnover of the enzyme. The difficulty for enzymes to release the products can arise from the fact that typically the latter have similar physico-chemical characteristics to the substrates and therefore maintain a significant affinity for the enzyme."

These two residues are too far away from each other in the locked state to form a hydrogen bond (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), and therefore this interaction is characteristic only of the unlocked conformation. This finding suggests that this hydrogen bond provides a specific interaction by which one could selectively target the stability of the EP* intermediate.

This result was expected as the mutation does not modify interactions present in the native state but was designed explicitly to perturb a hydrogen bond in the intermediate state. The ability of the N44A variant to release triNAG from its bound state was assessed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). By using a double-referenced single chain model (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we estimated that the destabilisation of the intermediate in the N44A mutant reduces the k<sub>off</sub> by a factor 3, while changing the K<sub>d</sub> by a factor 1/3. The variation of a factor 2 of the k<sub>on</sub> suggests that the pathways of capture and release are not completely distinct and thus perturbing the pathway for release affects in part also that of capture. These results are consistent with our prediction that the N44A mutation affects the stability of the EP* intermediate, that is, of the unlocked state. Finally, we tested the catalytic efficiency of the wild-type and N44A mutant by using a cellular assay (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), and compared these results with those obtained for an inactive mutational variant lacking the catalytic residue (E35D). The results (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) show that the N44A variant has an intermediate activity between wild type and the totally inactive control E35D variant, which is again consistent with the prediction that the mutation of asparagine to alanine of residue 44 would reduce the efficiency of the product release in such a way to affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Finally, to verify that the N44A modified the free-energy landscape of lysozyme by reducing the population of the unlocked state, we performed <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H RDC measurements on the N44A mutant and carried out restrained molecular dynamics simulations to determine its free-energy landscape.

We have validated this structure by identifying a distinctive structural characteristic of this state, a transient hydrogen bond between the side-chains of residues N44 and E35. As this interaction stabilises the intermediate state but not the ground state, we introduced a mutational variant (N44A) that, by removing specifically the hydrogen bond, reduces the stability of the intermediate state but not that of the ground state and thus inhibits the release process. Our results provide an illustration of the manner in which conformational fluctuations can play a central role in enzymatic reactions by creating low-population intermediate states that facilitate the challenging step of release of the products of the catalytic reaction."

We have previously shown (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cavalli et al., 2013</a>), however, that it is possible to effectively achieve this limit even if the values of <i>M</i> and <i>\u03b1</i> remain relatively small and thus obtain conformational ensembles that provide a good agreement between experimental and calculated observables. Following these procedures, we used here <i>M = 16</i> and for the weight, <i>\u03b1</i>, we first carried out an initial equilibration simulation at 310 K, during which the agreement between the calculated and experimental data was allowed to converge by gradually raising \u03b1 to the largest possible value that did not generate numerical instabilities. Subsequently, we performed a series of 50 cycles of simulated annealing between 310 and 500 K to sample the conformational space. Each cycle was carried out for a total of 250 ps (125,000 molecular dynamics steps). For each cycle, we collected 24,000 structures (1 per ps in the final 50 ps of the final 30 cycles of each of the 16 replicas). These structures were employed for the analyses reported in this study."

The reason is that the SVD method does not necessarily provide the actual alignment tensor of a given structure but rather the alignment tensor that generates the RDC values in the closest agreement with the experimental ones and hence is less well suited in describing the specific differences between the structures considered in the averaging procedure in <a href=\"#equ3\">Equation (3)</a> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Montalvao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">De Simone et al., 2013b</a>)."

The data show that the ground state (\u223c87%) exists in the locked state (the one wherein the product is still bound to the enzyme) and in equilibrium with an energetically excited state (populated \u223c13% of the time), which allows product release (termed the unlocked state). The two states are related by an opening/closure of the ligand-binding cleft by \u223c10 degrees."

The unlocked conformations lose the tight interactions that are stabilized in the locked state and gain new interactions on the external surface of the protein. These interactions, which mainly involve hydrogen bonds between donors and acceptors groups from the ligand and the protein surface, are highly variable and heterogeneous in the unlocked conformations. It is hypothesized that the unlocked state represents an intermediate state that is critical for fast product release. The authors then identified a stabilizing hydrogen bond that can be formed only in the unlocked state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), which involves side-chain atoms of residue N44 E35. The ability of the N44A variant to release triNAG from its bound state was assessed by SPR. The dissociation constants of the wild-type and the N44A variant to be, respectively, 4.19 sec-1 and 1.31 sec-1. This provides a degree of cross-validation that this state is in fact important for release."
