The amount of centromeric CENP-A has direct implications for both the architecture and epigenetic inheritance of centromeres. Using complementary strategies, we determined that typical human centromeres contain \u223c400 molecules of CENP-A, which is controlled by a mass-action mechanism. This number, despite representing only \u223c4% of all centromeric nucleosomes, forms a \u223c50-fold enrichment to the overall genome. In addition, although pre-assembled CENP-A is randomly segregated during cell division, this amount of CENP-A is sufficient to prevent stochastic loss of centromere function and identity. Finally, we produced a statistical map of CENP-A occupancy at a human neocentromere and identified nucleosome positions that feature CENP-A in a majority of cells. In summary, we present a quantitative view of the centromere that provides a mechanistic framework for both robust epigenetic inheritance of centromeres and the paucity of neocentromere formation."

The amount of centromeric CENP-A has direct implications for both the architecture and epigenetic inheritance of centromeres. Using complementary strategies, we determined that typical human centromeres contain \u223c400 molecules of CENP-A, which is controlled by a mass-action mechanism. This number, despite representing only \u223c4% of all centromeric nucleosomes, forms a \u223c50-fold enrichment to the overall genome. In addition, although pre-assembled CENP-A is randomly segregated during cell division, this amount of CENP-A is sufficient to prevent stochastic loss of centromere function and identity. Finally, we produced a statistical map of CENP-A occupancy at a human neocentromere and identified nucleosome positions that feature CENP-A in a majority of cells. In summary, we present a quantitative view of the centromere that provides a mechanistic framework for both robust epigenetic inheritance of centromeres and the paucity of neocentromere formation."

Rather, a special type of histone, called CENP-A, is involved in defining its location. Bodor et al. use multiple techniques to show that human centromeres normally contain around 400 molecules of CENP-A, and that this number is crucial for ensuring that centromeres form in the right place. Interestingly, only a minority of the CENP-A molecules are located at centromeres; yet this is more than at any other region of the chromosome. This explains why centromeres are only formed at a single position on each chromosome."

In this way memory of the centromere location is maintained. If the number of copies of CENP-A inherited by one of the chromosomes drops below a threshold value, a centromere will not form. However, Bodor et al. found that the number of CENP-A molecules in a centromere is large enough, not only to support the formation of the centromere structure, but also to keep it above the threshold value in nearly all cases. This threshold is also high enough to make it unlikely that a centromere will form in the wrong place because of a random fluctuation in the number of CENP-A molecules. Therefore, the number of CENP-A molecules is crucial for controlling both the formation and the inheritance of the centromere."

                        "text": "Centromeres are essential for proper cell division. During mitosis, a transient structure called the kinetochore is assembled onto centromeric chromatin, which mediates the interaction between DNA and the mitotic spindle (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allshire and Karpen, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cheeseman and Desai, 2008</a>). Intriguingly, although centromeres are directly embedded in chromatin, specific DNA sequences are neither necessary nor sufficient for centromere function. This is best exemplified by the rare occurrence, within the human population, of neocentromeres: functional centromeres that have repositioned to atypical loci on the chromosome (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amor et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Marshall et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">du Sart et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Voullaire et al., 1993</a>). Rather than centromeric sequences, the primary candidate for epigenetic specification of centromeres is the histone variant CENP-A, which replaces canonical H3 in centromeric nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib64\">Palmer et al., 1987</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Stoler et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Henikoff et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Yoda et al., 2000</a>). CENP-A chromatin is sufficient for recruitment of the downstream centromere and kinetochore complexes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Foltz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Okada et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Carroll et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barnhart et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Guse et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Mendiburo et al., 2011</a>). In addition, CENP-A is stably transmitted at centromeres during mitotic (<a href=\"#bib44\">Jansen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bodor et al., 2013</a>) and meiotic (<a href=\"#bib66\">Raychaudhuri et al., 2012</a>) divisions, and its assembly is tightly cell cycle controlled (<a href=\"#bib44\">Jansen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Schuh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Silva et al., 2012</a>). Importantly, targeting of this protein to an ectopic site of the genome is sufficient to initiate an epigenetic feedback loop, recruiting more CENP-A to this site (<a href=\"#bib60\">Mendiburo et al., 2011</a>). However, little is known about the quantity of CENP-A present at centromeres, despite this being an essential parameter for a functional understanding of both centromeric architecture and epigenetic inheritance. Here, we use multiple, independent approaches to determine the absolute copy number of CENP-A at centromeres. In addition, we provide novel insights in the mechanisms of centromere size control."

To accomplish this, we removed a significant and essential portion of the CENP-A gene to create a knock-out allele in stably diploid, human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, bottom). Subsequently, a fluorescent knock-in allele was created by placing GFP or YFP encoding sequences in frame with the sole remaining CENP-A gene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, middle). Specifically, we have built the following endogenously targeted RPE cell lines: CA<sup>+/\u2212</sup>, CA<sup>G/\u2212</sup>, CA<sup>Y/\u2212</sup>, and CA<sup>+/F</sup> (where + = wild-type; \u2212 = knock-out; G = GFP knock-in; Y = YFP knock-in; F = floxed [to control for potential gene-targeting artifacts]; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

However, instead of maintaining a fixed amount of CENP-A at centromeres, the levels varied extensively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Both CA<sup>+/\u2212</sup> and CA<sup>G/\u2212</sup> cells, which contain a single intact allele, have decreased centromeric CENP-A levels, while the parental CA<sup>+/F</sup> cells maintain wild-type levels. Surprisingly, despite expressing CENP-A from a single allele, CA<sup>Y/\u2212</sup> cells have increased CENP-A levels, which may be due to adaptations that arose during the creation of this cell line. As expected, CENP-A levels are further elevated in CA<sup>Y/\u2212</sup>+OE cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Remarkably, we found a very high correlation (r<sup>2</sup> = 84%) for a hypothetical directly proportional relationship between centromeric and total cellular CENP-A-GFP or CENP-A-YFP levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Similarly, despite an only approximately twofold range of expression, we still observe a high correlation with direct proportionality (r<sup>2</sup> = 71%) for cells expressing untagged CENP-A (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Thus, our observations indicate that centromeric levels are determined by a mass-action mechanism, where the amount of centromeric CENP-A varies in direct proportion with the cellular content."

For example, proteins involved in depositing CENP-A at the centromere may have adapted to CENP-A expression levels. Indeed, we see a weak correlation between the levels of CENP-A and its histone chaperone HJURP (<a href=\"#bib23\">Dunleavy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Foltz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barnhart et al., 2011</a>) in our cell lines (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Conversely, no correlation was detected for Mis18BP1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), another essential protein for CENP-A assembly (<a href=\"#bib31\">Fujita et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Maddox et al., 2007</a>), arguing that it is a non-stoichiometric component of the loading pathway. To test whether centromeric CENP-A levels require long-term adaptation, we analyzed the effect of CENP-A and/or HJURP overexpression in a single round of CENP-A assembly. Therefore, we transiently expressed CENP-A and/or HJURP and measured the level of centromeric CENP-A after a single cell cycle in HeLa cells, which can be effectively synchronized in S phase using thymidine. While induction of CENP-A expression leads to a prompt increase in centromeric levels, no (additional) effect was observed by expression of HJURP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Together, our results strongly suggest that centromeric CENP-A levels are directly regulated by its protein expression levels."

In vertebrates, previous estimates range from a few tens of molecules (in chicken DT40 cells, <a href=\"#bib68\">Ribeiro et al., 2010</a>) to a potential maximum of tens of thousands (in HeLa cells, <a href=\"#bib10\">Black et al., 2007</a>). To directly determine the copy number of CENP-A on human centromeres, we developed a 3D imaging strategy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), which we adapted from a method used previously to quantify cytokinesis proteins in fission yeast (<a href=\"#bib91\">Wu and Pollard, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Wu et al., 2008</a>). In brief, we use a non-cell permeable dye (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, I) to determine the 3D shape of cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, II) and measure the total amount of fluorescence within the entire cell volume (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, III). Total cellular fluorescence of CA<sup>Y/\u2212</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, III) was corrected for autofluorescence measured in wild-type RPE cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, IV), thus resulting in a measure of total CENP-A-derived fluorescence. Next, centromere-specific fluorescence was measured after correction for local background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, V; <a href=\"#bib41\">Hoffman et al., 2001</a>) and axial oversampling. Importantly, fluorescence lifetime of CENP-A-YFP is similar between highly concentrated centromeric and diffuse cytoplasmic pools (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), arguing that clustering does not lead to changes in fluorescence efficiency. In effect, our 3D-integrated fluorescence strategy measures the centromeric fraction of CENP-A compared to the total cellular pool. We find that while CENP-A is enriched at centromeres, on average only 0.44% of cellular CENP-A is present per centromere in CA<sup>Y/\u2212</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Very similar fractions were observed in CA<sup>G/\u2212</sup> and CA<sup>Y/\u2212</sup>+OE cells (0.38% in both cases; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>), which provides an additional line of evidence in support of a mass-action mechanism for CENP-A assembly. Furthermore, these findings show that a surprising minority, about one-fifth of the CENP-A protein content (0.44% \u00d7 46) is present on the functionally relevant subcellular location, i.e. at the centromeres."

Importantly, we ensured that recombinant and cellular CENP-A have the same transfer efficiency and can be directly compared to each other (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

In human cells, cellular protein levels of CENP-A peak in late G2 (<a href=\"#bib77\">Shelby et al., 2000</a>), while incorporation into centromeric chromatin occurs in early G1 phase (<a href=\"#bib44\">Jansen et al., 2007</a>). Thus, it is possible that part of the cell-to-cell variation of the centromeric CENP-A ratio observed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> is due to differing cell cycle stages. We tested this possibility using a previously developed fluorescent ubiquitin-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) that can be used in live cells (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</a>). In particular, we used hCdt1(30/120)-RFP, which is expressed ubiquitously throughout the cell cycle, but is specifically degraded in S, G2, and M phases (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</a>). As a result, protein levels increase as cells enter and progress through G1 phase, peak at the G1/S boundary, and then drop until cells re-enter G1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We expressed this protein in CA<sup>Y/\u2212</sup> cells and tracked the RFP fluorescence intensity over time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) to identify cells that entered S phase (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). We compared the centromeric fraction of CENP-A of S Phase cells to that of randomly cycling cells and found that neither the mean nor the variance differs significantly between these two populations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Importantly, expression of the FUCCI marker itself has no effect on the measurements performed (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). While the centromeric fraction of CENP-A is likely low in G2 phase and high just after assembly in early G1, we find that the variation observed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> is not a consequence of such cell cycle-induced effects and may instead reflect inherent variation between cells."

This argues that the measurements performed above are not significantly influenced by a potential inaccuracy in determining the cytoplasmic pool. Interestingly, it has recently been shown that detectable levels of CENP-A are assembled into non-centromeric chromatin of HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lacoste et al., 2014</a>). We now find that, at least in RPE cells the proporation of chromatin bound CENP-A outside of the centromere is surprisingly high (\u223c66% in this cell line)."

                                "text": "To further validate that the strategy described above accurately measures centromeric CENP-A copy numbers, we used two additional independent quantification methods. First, we applied a method that employs the statistical properties of fluorescence redistribution (<a href=\"#bib70\">Rosenfeld et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib69\">2006</a>). This method relies on the fact that random segregation of fluorescent molecules leads to each daughter receiving an (unequal) fraction, where the distribution of differences relates to the total number of molecules (as outlined in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). During mitosis, sister centromeres form individually resolved spots by light microscopy, allowing us to measure the fluorescence intensity of individual sisters (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We find that rather than accurately segregating exactly half of pre-assembled CENP-A onto each daughter chromatid, the difference between sister centromeres follows a random distribution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Previously, Rosenfeld et al. have provided mathematical evidence that measurements of this deviation allow for the determination of the fluorescence intensity of a single heritable, segregating unit (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#bib70\">Rosenfeld et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib69\">2006</a>). We measured an average of 75.4 segregating units of CENP-A-GFP per centromere in CA<sup>G/\u2212</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Because each segregating unit consists of one or more nucleosomes, containing two molecules of CENP-A each (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sekulic et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Tachiwana et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bassett et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hasson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Padeganeh et al., 2013</a>), an average CA<sup>G/\u2212</sup> centromere has a minimum of 150.8 molecules of CENP-A. Correcting the amount of CENP-A measured in CA<sup>G/\u2212</sup> cells for wild-type levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) results in \u2265377 molecules of CENP-A per centromere (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, right y-axis). Importantly, these measurements differ significantly if random centromere pairs are chosen for which no statistical correlation exists (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). This confirms that fluorescence intensities at sister centromeres co-vary and renders this type of analysis suitable for centromere quantification. Stochastic fluctuation measurements in CA<sup>Y/\u2212</sup> and CA<sup>Y/\u2212</sup>+OE cells indicates that wild-type cells contain \u2265188 and \u2265149 CENP-A molecules per centromere, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Importantly, the number of co-segregating CENP-A nucleosomes is unknown, which can be one or more. Therefore, despite the variation between the cell lines used here, all results obtained from this method provide a minimum estimate of the centromeric CENP-A copy number that is in agreement with the 400 centromeric molecules of CENP-A measured above (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>)."

Indeed, based on a conserved ratio of centromere and kinetochore proteins and kinetochore microtubules between multiple yeast species as well as chicken DT40 cells, it has been hypothesized that centromeres form modular structures by repeating individual structural subunits (<a href=\"#bib45\">Joglekar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Johnston et al., 2010</a>), as originally proposed by <a href=\"#bib93\">Zinkowski et al. (1991)</a>. Thus, the amount of CENP-A would directly reflect the number of downstream centromere and kinetochore proteins and microtubule attachment sites. Conversely, experiments in human cells indicate that the centromere is assembled by multiple independent subcomplexes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Foltz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Liu et al., 2006</a>). Here, we analyzed whether altering the levels of CENP-A has an effect on the recruitment of other, downstream centromere or kinetochore proteins. Both CENP-C and CENP-T rely on CENP-A for their centromeric recruitment (<a href=\"#bib67\">R\u00e9gnier et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fachinetti et al., 2013</a>) and have recently been shown to be responsible for mitotic recruitment of the KMN network (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gascoigne et al., 2011</a>), including the key microtubule binding protein Hec1/NDC80 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cheeseman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">DeLuca et al., 2006</a>). Interestingly, we found that none of these three proteins were significantly affected by altering the levels of CENP-A between 40% and 240% of wild-type levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In line with previous findings (<a href=\"#bib52\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fachinetti et al., 2013</a>), these results argue against a modular centromere architecture where CENP-A nucleosomes form individual binding sites for downstream components.

MN often arise as a consequence of mitotic errors, such as lagging chromosomes during anaphase (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ford et al., 1988</a>), breakage of anaphase bridges (<a href=\"#bib40\">Hoffelder et al., 2004</a>), or multipolar mitoses (<a href=\"#bib86\">Utani et al., 2010</a>). The presence of MN can be scored by DAPI staining (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, bottom). A baseline fraction of 0.53% \u00b1 0.07% (n = 4) of wild-type CA<sup>+/+</sup> cells contain MN (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Both cell lines that have decreased CENP-A levels show a significantly increased fraction of cells with MN with 2.77% \u00b1 0.48% (n = 3) and 1.95% \u00b1 0.50% (n = 4) in CA<sup>+/\u2212</sup> and CA<sup>G/\u2212</sup> cells, respectively. Importantly, these two cell lines were derived independently from the parental CA<sup>+/F</sup> cell line (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), which has wild-type levels of CENP-A and no significant increase in MN (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In addition, neither cell line with increased CENP-A levels has a larger fraction of MN than CA<sup>+/F</sup> cells. While the essential role for CENP-A in centromere function is well established (<a href=\"#bib67\">R\u00e9gnier et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Black et al., 2007</a>), our results indicate that a critical level of CENP-A is passed after reducing the levels to \u223c50%. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for MN formation remains unclear, as downstream centromere and kinetochore components of CENP-A remain unaffected."

This could either be due to <i>in cis</i> features driving differential regulation of CENP-A on individual centromeres, or by stochastic, yet unbiased, effects at centromeres. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured the centromeric levels of endogenous CENP-A on specific chromosomes. First, we analyzed a monoclonal HCT-116 cell line that has an integrated Lac-array in a unique position in the genome (<a href=\"#bib85\">Thompson and Compton, 2011</a>). While the site of integration is unknown, expressing LacI-GFP allows for the identification of the same chromosome in a population of cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Both the average and variance of CENP-A at this centromere does not differ statistically from the bulk (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), arguing against centromere specific features driving CENP-A levels on the Lac-marked chromosome. Conversely, we found that the Y-centromere, uniquely identified by the lack of CENP-B (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Earnshaw et al., 1987</a>), of two independent male cell lines had a slight yet significant reduction of CENP-A (19% in wild-type HCT-116 and 13% in DLD-1; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>), consistent with an earlier report (<a href=\"#bib43\">Irvine et al., 2004</a>). Finally, we used a human patient-derived fibroblast cell line (PDNC-4) where one centromere of chromosome 4 has repositioned to an atypical location (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amor et al., 2004</a>), which we designate as NeoCEN-4 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). As has been observed in other cell lines derived from this patient (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amor et al., 2004</a>), we found that the NeoCEN-4 has a \u223c25% decrease in centromeric CENP-A (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Taken together, these results show that while CENP-A expression drives centromeric levels, local sequence or chromatin features can also contribute to the average amount of CENP-A at specific centromeres. Nevertheless, even on these centromeres, the variance in CENP-A levels is maintained, indicating that other stochastic processes contribute to CENP-A levels."

This indicates that either CENP-A is randomly distributed at a low level throughout the centromere domain or that it occupies specific \u2018hotspots\u2019. Due to their repetitive nature, it is not possible to map individual CENP-A nucleosomes on canonical centromeres. However, a recent high-resolution ChIP-seq analysis of the (non-repetitive) NeoCEN-4 identified 1113 unique CENP-A nucleosome positions spanning a \u223c300 kb locus (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hasson et al., 2013</a>). By combining the relative height of individual peaks with the total number of CENP-A nucleosomes at this neocentromere, we were able to determine the fraction of cells containing CENP-A at each nucleosome position (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a>). This statistical map of CENP-A occupancy shows that, while the median is \u223c6% (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K</a>), individual positions feature CENP-A with a surprisingly high occupancy (up to 80% of all cells; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J</a>, arrow). Remarkably, more than one third of all CENP-A nucleosomes are located on the top 10% potential positions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K</a>, inset).

For this reason, the yeast centromere cluster has been extensively used to calibrate fluorescence intensities of CENP-A and other proteins from a number of species (<a href=\"#bib46\">Joglekar et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Johnston et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schittenhelm et al., 2010</a>). However, the single nucleosome hypothesis has recently been challenged (<a href=\"#bib19\">Coffman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Lawrimore et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Haase et al., 2013</a>). To avoid dependency on any single reference, we used three independent methods to measure the human centromeric CENP-A copy number. One strategy uses intrinsically controlled fluorescence ratios of cellular and centromeric CENP-A-YFP signals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The second method does not rely directly on fluorescence intensities, but rather on the stochastic redistribution of CENP-A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Finally, we compared CENP-A signals directly to a calibrated fluorescent standard (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Importantly, despite the independent nature of these strategies, they all come to a very similar conclusion. Therefore, we demonstrate that typical centromeres in human RPE cells contain \u223c400 molecules of CENP-A. While there is a continuing debate on the composition of CENP-A nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Black and Cleveland, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Henikoff and Furuyama, 2012</a>), current evidence, at least in human cells, strongly favors an octameric arrangement harboring two copies of CENP-A (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sekulic et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Tachiwana et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bassett et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hasson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Padeganeh et al., 2013</a>). Hence, our numbers, correspond to 200 CENP-A nucleosomes in interphase, which are split into 100 nucleosomes on mitotic chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>)."

We find that rather than accurately ensuring that each daughter receives exactly half, redistribution of CENP-A occurs in a random fashion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Because this type of regulation has the potential for individual centromeres to stochastically inherit critically low levels of CENP-A, the steady state must be sufficiently high to avoid chromosome loss. Although the critical amount of CENP-A is not known, we have previously shown that HeLa cell viability is lost if CENP-A levels are reduced to \u223c33% (<a href=\"#bib10\">Black et al., 2007</a>), <i>i.e.</i> 44 nucleosomes (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). Conversely, we show here that CA<sup>G/\u2212</sup> cells are viable at 40% of RPE levels (80 nucleosomes). Consequently, we estimate that the critical number of nucleosomes that must be inherited, which is half of the steady state level and is replenished during G1 phase, lies between 22 and 40. We used these values to calculate the chance that any one centromere per cell inherits critically low levels of CENP-A for different steady state and critical CENP-A nucleosome levels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). We demonstrate that at a steady state of 200 CENP-A nucleosomes per centromere, less than one in 10<sup>16</sup> cell divisions will give rise to a centromere containing 40 CENP-A nucleosomes or less (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, left). Thus, the chance of inheriting a critical amount of CENP-A at wild-type steady state levels is negligible. Conversely, with 100 CENP-A nucleosomes at steady state, the chance of a chromosome inheriting even the most stringent critical level of 22 nucleosomes is close to 10<sup>\u22126</sup> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, right), which may pose a significant problem, for example during the development of a human organism. Conversely, although critical levels would be reached even less frequently if centromeres contained a steady state of, for example 300 CENP-A nucleosomes, this degree of accuracy may be superfluous and not outweigh the cost of maintaining a large centromere size (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>, right). Therefore, we argue that the number of CENP-A molecules found on human centromeres is optimized for robust epigenetic inheritance and centromeric function."

Indeed, based on the average size of the centromeric chromatin domain, we estimate that 200 CENP-A nucleosomes represent only \u223c4% of all centromeric nucleosomes (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> for calculation). Surprisingly, we find that the majority of chromatin bound CENP-A is located outside the centromere. Indeed, a recent study found that a proportion of CENP-A containing nucleosomes also exist in non-centromeric chromatin of HeLa cells, and is assembled by DAXX, a major chaperone of histone H3.3 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lacoste et al., 2014</a>). In addition, detectable levels of non-centromeric CENP-A have been observed in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib14\">Camahort et al., 2009</a>) and chicken DT40 cells (<a href=\"#bib76\">Shang et al., 2013</a>). Here, we quantify this pool in human RPE cells and while there is more than twice as many non-centromeric CENP-A nucleosomes than there are centromeric ones, this only represents &lt;0.1% of all nucleosomes in the genome and thus CENP-A is \u223c50-fold enriched (per unit length of DNA) at centromeres (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). This result may explain how, despite being outnumbered 25:1 by other H3 variants at the centromere, CENP-A can still accurately specify the centromeric locus. This hypothesis may potentially be tested by creating artificial CENP-A binding sites (e.g., using the LacO/LacI system) of different known sizes and determining the threshold at which centromeres can be formed."

Our finding that CENP-T, CENP-C, and Hec1 do not quantitatively correlate with CENP-A levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) argues that not each (non-centromeric) CENP-A nucleosome is able to recruit downstream centromere components. It would be interesting to determine to what extent other centromere and kinetochore proteins are present throughout the genome and whether they are also enriched at extra-centromeric CENP-A \u2018hotspots\u2019. This question is particularly relevant since it has been observed that downstream centromere components may affect centromeric CENP-A levels (<a href=\"#bib61\">Okada et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Carroll et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Hori et al., 2013</a>).

Nevertheless, here we show that within a sixfold range of expression levels, the CENP-A loading machinery has a constant efficiency, which maintains a strict ratio between the centromeric and total pools of CENP-A. Thus, within a physiological range, centromeric CENP-A levels are regulated by a mass-action mechanism, where the loading efficiency is independent of the expression levels. This mechanism ensures that with fluctuating expression levels, CENP-A remains mainly centromere restricted, and may prevent potential neocentromere seeding."

One possible explanation for this is that there is a fixed subset of \u2018active\u2019 CENP-A nucleosomes that is responsible for recruiting downstream components, even if the total amount of CENP-A is variable. Alternatively, an excess of CENP-A could form a chromatin domain that provides a \u2018platform\u2019 for recruitment of a centromere complex of fixed size. Surprisingly, however, we find that a critical amount of CENP-A for prevention of micronuclei is reached even before downstream centromere and kinetochore protein levels are affected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 8B</a>)."

However, in agreement with prior publications, we find that both the Y-centromere and a human neocentromere have lower CENP-A levels (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amor et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Irvine et al., 2004</a>). Interestingly, both these centromere types are atypical in that they are formed on relatively small genomic loci: \u223c600 kb for the Y-centromere (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abruzzo et al., 1996</a>) and \u223c300 kb for the NeoCEN-4 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hasson et al., 2013</a>), whereas autosomes and the X-chromosome have alpha-sattellite arrays of several magabases in size (<a href=\"#bib89\">Wevrick and Willard, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mahtani and Willard, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lo et al., 1999</a>). In addition, in contrast to canonical centromeres, neither the Y-centromere nor neocentromeres recruit the sequence-specific DNA binding protein CENP-B (<a href=\"#bib25\">Earnshaw et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Amor et al., 2004</a>), which has been hypothesized to alter the 3D structure of centromeric chromatin (<a href=\"#bib65\">Pluta et al., 1992</a>). The presence of CENP-B binding sites has recently been shown to have a role in phasing CENP-A nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hasson et al., 2013</a>), and to cooperate with CENP-A in kinetochore function (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fachinetti et al., 2013</a>), and may therefore be involved in regulation of centromeric CENP-A levels as well. Furthermore, high resolution analysis of a human neocentromere reveals a non-random distribution of CENP-A (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hasson et al., 2013</a>), where individual nucleosome positions are occupied in anywhere between 0.5% and 80% of cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7J,K</a>). Thus, despite specific DNA sequences being neither sufficient nor required for centromere identity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Earnshaw and Migeon, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Voullaire et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Amor et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Marshall et al., 2008</a>), the amount of CENP-A at centromeres likely results from a combination of a systematic cellular mechanism with a contribution of local sequence or chromatin features."

First, while CENP-A nucleosomes are highly enriched at the centromere, most CENP-A is distributed at low levels throughout chromatin. This indicates that there is no exclusive pathway that restricts CENP-A assembly to centromeres. Nevertheless, we propose that the ample number of CENP-A nucleosomes facilitates a robust epigenetic signal that can absorb fluctuations in CENP-A inheritance and assembly in order to faithfully maintain centromere identity. Secondly, the requirement for a sizable number of CENP-A nucleosomes to perpetuate an active centromere reduces the likelihood for inadvertent detrimental neocentromere seeding without the need for a tightly restricted assembly mechanism. In addition, the fixed ratio between total and centromeric CENP-A levels may prevent excess CENP-A from accumulating at high density at non-centromeric loci, thus further reducing the probability of neocentromere formation. Finally, the number of centromeric CENP-A nucleosomes represents an ample pool of which only a subset is required to nucleate otherwise self-organized centromere and kinetochore complexes. In summary, from our analysis an integrated view of centromeric architecture, size, and regulation emerges (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) that provides a basis to explain the self-propagating nature of the epigenetic centromere."

Non-cell permeable dextran-AlexaFluor647 (10,000 MW; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added at 2\u20134 \u03bcg/ml to stain the medium outside of cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,I</a>). To minimize oversampling, individual live cells were imaged at 500 nm axial resolution (close to the resolution limit of the objective) spanning the entire cell volume. Images were flatfield corrected for unequal illumination using the signal of a uniform fluorescent slide and the \u2018Shading Corrector\u2019 plugin for FIJI. For each axial section, the cell outline was determined based on absence of dextran-AlexaFluor647 staining, and the integrated fluorescence intensities inside the cell outline as well as those of 1\u20133 independent background regions per section were determined. Background corrected signals from all sections were summed to determine the total cellular fluorescence. Fluorescence measurements of CA<sup>Y/\u2212</sup>, CA<sup>G/\u2212</sup>, or CA<sup>Y/\u2212</sup>+OE cells were corrected for autofluorescence by subtraction of average per pixel fluorescence intensity of non-fluorescent CA<sup>+/+</sup> cells from the same dish. Alternatively, CA<sup>+/+</sup>+H2B-RFP and CA<sup>Y/\u2212</sup>+H2B-RFP cells were mixed and no dextran was added to the medium. In this case, the H2B-RFP signal was used to determine the nuclear volume, and the total nuclear fluorescence was determined as described above for the total cellular volume. Automated centromere detection was performed by an analogous algorithm to a previous study (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bodor et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2013</a>), where diffraction limited spots are detected based on their size, circularity, and feret's diameter. Centromere signals were measured by integrating the intensity of a 5 pixel diameter surrounding each centromere in the appropriate axial section. Local background fluorescence was derived by measuring the difference in intensity between concentric circles of 5 and 7 pixel diameter, and subtracted from centromeric signals (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hoffman et al., 2001</a>). In addition, centromeric signals were corrected for axial oversampling. For this, diffraction limited spots of yellow/green PS-Speck fluorescent beads (Molecular Probes) were measured in multiple plains. The sum intensity of individual beads from all these plains was compared to the signal in the plain with the maximum signal (<i>i.e.</i>, the focal plane).

To control for this the reviewers suggest selecting cells at G1/S to represent cells that completed centromeric CENP-A assembly (100% centromere occupancy and minimal soluble pool) and late G2 or mitotic cells to represent cells with maximal nascent soluble pool, then perform the quantitation on these isolates. These populations should be obtained without using drug synchronisation that could perturb the process, for example by mitotic shake off. In this respect, Reviewer 3 emphasises (point 5) that your argument that low levels of CENP-A could account for mis-segregation would not stand if sisters with less CENP-A are 'replenished' during the subsequent G1."

Others have found that there are significant amounts of CENP-A outside centromeres, but have not tried to quantify it as convincingly as these authors. For example in Camahort et al. (Mol Cell v. 35), the fact that significant amounts of Cse4 were found outside the centromere was mentioned. Recently in the neocentromere paper by Hori et al. (Dev. Cell), their ChIP-Seq data revealed significant amounts of CENP-A outside the chicken centromeres Z and 5, but again overall amounts were not given. The authors should expand their discussion to explore this. For example, how much of a non-centromeric pool is there likely to be for other CCAN components? The answer could be similar to that for CENP-A. Thus, the key question is what causes the critical local concentration that nucleates the centromeric chromatin?"

For example, the authors tried to correlate further reduction of CENP-A from the parental RPE line with increases in micronuclei. I am not convinced that the slightly increased frequency of micronuclei is due to a moderate decrease in CENP-A. They would need to show that restoring CENP-A suppresses the phenotype. It is especially a problem when the authors attempt to say that this amount of CENP-A represents the number in \u201cnormal\u201d tissue. The results are meaningful in the background of the RPE cell line, but even it is a relevant number, it still has limited value since they have shown that CENP-A levels vary greatly among cell lines and there is no strict correlation with the level of genome instability. This suggests that other 'background' mutations probably contribute greatly to the level of genome instability, and that they only made a weak correlation between CENP-A reduction and increased micronuclei. Overall, these issues raise concerns about using micronucleus frequencies as a direct measure of the impact of altering CENP-A levels, and whether CENP-A reduction accounts for the observed phenotype. The authors determined the critical number based on the observations that HeLa cells with 33% CENP-A are not viable but RPE cells with 40% CENP-A are viable, so they reason that the critical number must lie somewhere in between these two numbers. However, these are completely different lines, with HeLa cells carrying hundreds or thousands of other mutations not in the RPE background. Viability is a combined readout of more than one related pathway. Viability of HeLa cells and RPE cells may have different sensitivity to the levels of CENP-A due to potential mutations in related pathways."

Does DAXX mediated incorporation happen in the various RPE cells? The authors only considered canonical CENP-A loading at the centromere, but I don't think that it makes much sense to talk about mass action without considering the DAXX dependent assembly that may compete with HJURP for centromeric assembly.

Instead, we address this issue in a manner that avoids using drug-based synchronization using part of the FUCCI system developed by Sakaue-Sawano et al. (Cell, 2008). With this system, we were able to selectively measure the centromeric CENP-A ratio in S phase cells. Because in human cells CENP-A expression starts in (late) G2 phase (Shelby et al., JCB 2000) and incorporation occurs in (early) G1 phase (<a href=\"#bib44\">Jansen et al., 2007</a>), by selecting cells in S phase, we likely discard any variation of centromeric to whole cell fluorescence that would be induced by cell cycle related effects."

Cell), their ChIP-Seq data revealed significant amounts of CENP-A outside the chicken centromeres Z and 5, but again overall amounts were not given. The authors should expand their discussion to explore this. For example, how much of a non-centromeric pool is there likely to be for other CCAN components?

It is especially a problem when the authors attempt to say that this amount of CENP-A represents the number in \u201cnormal\u201d tissue. The results are meaningful in the background of the RPE cell line, but even it is a relevant number, it still has limited value since they have shown that CENP-A levels vary greatly among cell lines and there is no strict correlation with the level of genome instability. This suggests that other 'background' mutations probably contribute greatly to the level of genome instability, and that they only made a weak correlation between CENP-A reduction and increased micronuclei. Overall, these issues raise concerns about using micronucleus frequencies as a direct measure of the impact of altering CENP-A levels, and whether CENP-A reduction accounts for the observed phenotype. The authors determined the critical number based on the observations that HeLa cells with 33% CENP-A are not viable but RPE cells with 40% CENP-A are viable, so they reason that the critical number must lie somewhere in between these two numbers. However, these are completely different lines, with HeLa cells carrying hundreds or thousands of other mutations not in the RPE background.
