These structures are formed by unique combinations of low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs), A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs, A\u03b4-LTMRs, and C-LTMRs, and their associated terminal Schwann cells (TSCs). In this study, we investigated the organization, ultrastructure, and maintenance of longitudinal lanceolate complexes at each hair follicle subtype. We found that TSC processes at hair follicles are tiled and that individual TSCs host axonal endings of more than one LTMR subtype. Electron microscopic analyses revealed unique ultrastructural features of lanceolate complexes that are proposed to underlie mechanotransduction. Moreover, Schwann cell ablation leads to loss of LTMR terminals at hair follicles while, in contrast, TSCs remain associated with hair follicles following skin denervation in adult mice and, remarkably, become re-associated with newly formed axons, indicating a TSC-dependence of lanceolate complex maintenance and regeneration in adults."

To detect, perceive, and respond to such diverse stimuli, morphologically and physiologically distinct classes of low-threshold mechanosensory neurons (LTMRs) innervate the skin and associate with cutaneous tactile end organs. These LTMRs, whose cell bodies are located in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and cranial sensory ganglia, carry impulses from their endings in the skin to the central nervous system (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lechner and Lewin, 2013</a>). LTMRs are classified as A\u03b2, A\u03b4 or C based on their action potential conduction velocities (<a href=\"#bib18\">Horch et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rice and Albrecht, 2008</a>). C-LTMRs are unmyelinated and thus have the slowest conduction velocities, whereas A\u03b4-LTMRs and A\u03b2-LTMRs are lightly and heavily myelinated, exhibiting intermediate and rapid conduction velocities, respectively. LTMRs are also classified as slowly, intermediately, or rapidly adapting (SA, IA, and RA-LTMRs) according to their rates of adaptation to sustained mechanical stimuli (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burgess et al., 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Johnson and Hsiao, 1992</a>). Genetic labeling of A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs, A\u03b4-LTMRs, and C-LTMRs has revealed that the cutaneous endings of each LTMR subtype in hairy skin form longitudinal lanceolate endings at one or more hair follicle subtypes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2011</a>)."

There are three major hair follicle subtypes in mouse back hairy skin: guard, awl/auchene, and zigzag. The three hair follicle subtypes emerge during different stages of hair follicle morphogenesis and have distinct morphologies and presumably distinct mechanical properties. Guard hairs, which make up \u223c1% of the back skin hairs of the mouse, develop during the first wave of hair follicle morphogenesis, beginning E13\u201314.5. These hairs have the longest hair shafts that have two rows of medulla cells and do not contain kinks. Awl hairs, which form during the second wave of murine hair morphogenesis, beginning E15\u201316.5, are straight but are shorter than guard hairs and contain three or four rows of medulla cells. Auchene hairs are developmentally and morphologically identical to awl hairs, except that they have one kink in the hair. Awl/auchene hairs together make up \u223c20% of back skin hairs and, for the purposes of this study, are considered together. Finally, zigzag hairs form during the third wave of hair morphogenesis beginning at E18.5 and are the most abundant type, making up \u223c80% of hairs. Zigzag hairs have one row of medulla cells and at least two bends in their hair shaft (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schlake, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Driskell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2011</a>). In addition to their different developmental and morphological properties, zigzag, awl/auchene, and guard hair follicles are each associated with unique combinations of LTMRs. Indeed, guard hair follicles are innervated by A\u03b2 RA-LTMR lanceolate endings and are also associated with A\u03b2 SA1-LTMR Merkel endings. In contrast, awl/auchene hairs are triply innervated by inter-digitated A\u03b2 RA-, A\u03b4-, and C-LTMR lanceolate endings, whereas zigzag hair follicles are innervated by inter-digitated A\u03b4- and C-LTMR lanceolate endings (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2011</a>). Thus, guard, awl/auchene, and zigzag hairs, with their unique combinations of LTMR endings, play neurophysiologically distinct roles in mechanosensory transduction (<a href=\"#bib20\">Iggo and Andres, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2011</a>)."

However, the organization of TSCs and LTMR lanceolate endings, and their functional relationship for maintenance of lanceolate complexes are largely unknown. In this study, we used histologic and genetic approaches to investigate the functional organization, ultrastructural properties, and maintenance of lanceolate complexes associated with the three hair follicle subtypes of the mouse."

Remarkably, in back hairy skin of the mouse, C-, A\u03b4-, and A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs form morphologically similar longitudinal lanceolate endings associated with hair follicles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Immunostaining with S100, a glial cell marker, shows that each type of LTMR lanceolate ending is associated with TSCs, with cell bodies of TSCs residing at the base of lanceolate complexes. Moreover, TSCs associated with C-, A\u03b4-, and A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs exhibit extensive longitudinal processes extending toward the skin surface. These finger-shaped processes are parallel to the long axis of the hair follicle and encase individual longitudinal lanceolate endings of C-, A\u03b4-, and A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

Indeed, whole-mount immunostaining of back hairy skin using anti-S100 shows that lanceolate complexes associated with the three different hair follicle subtypes appear to contain different numbers of TSCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Quantification of TSCs associated with individual hair follicles shows that individual awl/auchene hair follicles have slightly more TSCs compared with zigzag hair follicles, and that guard hair follicles have many more TSCs than both zigzag and awl/auchene hairs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Since zigzag, awl/auchene, and guard hair follicles have different diameters, we also compared the densities of TSCs at lanceolate complexes by dividing the number of TSCs by the circumference of individual hair follicles. Interestingly, TSC densities for lanceolate complexes associated with zigzag and awl/auchene hair follicles are comparable, while TSCs at guard hair follicles are considerably more compact (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We next asked whether individual TSCs at zigzag, awl/auchene, and guard hair follicles have similar or distinct morphologies. To visualize the morphological properties of individual TSCs at the three hair follicle types, we crossed the <i>Plp1</i><sup><i>CreER</i></sup> mouse line, which expresses CreER exclusively in glial cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Doerflinger et al., 2003</a>), to a <i>Rosa26</i><sup><i>YFP</i></sup> reporter mouse line, and achieved sparse labeling of TSCs by treating double transgenic animals with a single, low dose of tamoxifen (0.01 mg\u20130.03 mg; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013G</a>). Whole-mount immunostaining with anti-GFP allowed visualization of individual TSCs and measurement of the size of TSC cell bodies, as well as the width and length of their processes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013G,H\u2013J</a>). We found that the morphologies of individual TSCs associated with zigzag and awl/auchene hair follicles are comparable. In contrast, TSCs at guard hair follicles have smaller cell bodies, and fewer and considerably longer processes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2013J</a>). The greater numbers and unique morphologies of TSCs associated with guard hair follicles compared to those associated with zigzag and awl/auchene follicles, together with the finding that A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs represent the sole longitudinal lanceolate endings at guard hairs, suggests unique mechanotranduction functions of guard hairs in detecting hair movements."

Consistent with this, recent studies indicate that mechanosensory neurons with distinct molecular features can innervate the same hair follicle (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heidenreich et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wende et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Woo et al., 2012</a>). These observations raise the intriguing question of whether physiologically distinct LTMR subtypes that innervate the same hair follicle associate with the same or different TSCs. Based on the interdigitated patterns of LTMR axonal endings at zigzag and awl/auchene hair follicles (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2011</a>), there are at least two possible organizational patterns of their associated lanceolate complexes: 1) Each TSC hosts only one type of LTMR, and the interdigitated axonal terminals of different LTMRs are associated with interdigitated processes of TSCs; 2) Processes of TSCs at individual hair follicles are tiled and each TSC hosts interdigitated axonal terminals from two or more LTMR subtypes. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first crossed the <i>Plp1</i><sup><i>CreER</i></sup> mouse line to the multicolor Cre-reporter <i>Rosa26-Confetti</i> (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schepers et al., 2012</a>) to label TSCs with multiple reporters. Tamoxifen treatment of <i>Plp1</i><sup><i>CreER</i></sup><i>;Rosa26-Confetti</i> mice allows individual TSCs to express only one of the four fluorescent proteins encoded by the <i>Rosa26-Confetti</i> allele. Thus, adjacent TSCs will express different reporters allowing visualization of the organization of TSCs and their associated LTMR endings at individual hair follicles. In trunk hairy skin of <i>Plp1</i><sup><i>CreER</i></sup><i>;Rosa26-Confetti</i> animals, adjacent TSCs that are labeled by red and green fluorescence reporters exhibit non-overlapping sets of processes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Thus, the processes of TSCs associated with individual hair follicles are tiled. Moreover, this finding indicates that the organization of individually tiled TSCs and different LTMR endings can be visualized simply by immunostaining with glial cell markers. Interestingly, in back hairy skin sections from <i>Th</i><sup><i>CreER</i></sup><i>;Rosa26</i><sup><i>tdTomato</i></sup><i>;TrkB</i><sup><i>tauEGFP</i></sup> mice, in which C-LTMRs, A\u03b4-LTMRs, and TSCs are visualized with tdTomato, GFP, and S100 immunostaining, respectively, we found that C-LTMRs and A\u03b4-LTMRs form interdigitated lanceolate endings associated with processes belonging to the same TSC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,C\u2032</a>). Similar patterns were observed in skin sections from <i>Th</i><sup><i>CreER</i></sup><i>;Rosa26</i><sup><i>tdTomato</i></sup><i>;Npy2r-GFP</i> mice in which C-LTMRs and A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs were labeled with tdTomato and GFP, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, TSCs are tiled, and the processes of an individual TSC encase the axonal endings of multiple, physiologically distinct LTMR subtypes."

                                "text": "We next investigated the ultrastructural basis of mechanical responsiveness of lanceolate endings, and in particular the ultrastructural relationships between A\u03b2 RA-LTMR, A\u03b4-LTMR, and C-LTMR axonal terminals, TSCs, and the three hair follicles types. Transverse, ultrathin sections of lanceolate complexes associated with guard, awl/auchene, and zigzag hair follicles were collected, stained, and examined by electron microscopy (EM). Lanceolate complexes at all three hair follicle types appear as arrays of individual units composed of blade-shaped TSC processes and LTMR axonal endings aligned against the basal lamina of the hair follicle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). At guard hair follicles, each A\u03b2 RA-LTMR lanceolate axonal terminal (pseudo-colored in green) is encased by TSC processes (colored in pink) on three sides (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, cross sections of A\u03b2 RA-LTMR lanceolate complexes appear triangular in shape. There are frequent gaps between the TSC processes at the three edges of the axon. Interestingly, at the gaps or openings facing the hair follicle, the A\u03b2 RA-LTMR axon terminals form small protrusions that are closely aligned, together with adjacent TSC processes, against the basal lamina of the hair follicle epithelial (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,B\u2032</a>, arrows). In comparison, axonal protrusions through the other gaps, on sides facing away from the hair follicle epithelial cell, are less pronounced or absent and, when present, variable in width. Furthermore, the cytoplasm of A\u03b2 RA-LTMR axons is densely packed with mitochondria. At awl/auchene and zigzag hair follicles, axonal terminals are encased on two sides by TSC processes, and thus cross sections of these lanceolate complexes appear spindle-shaped (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Compared to lanceolate complexes at guard hair follicles, TSC processes associated with awl/auchene and zigzag follicles tend to be thicker (widths of EM cross sections of TSC processes at guard hairs: 302.7 \u00b1 132.7 nm, 17 process sections from two mice; awl/auchene hairs: 562.3 \u00b1 76.5 nm, 21 process sections from two mice; zigzag hairs: 397.7 \u00b1 19.4 nm, 32 process sections from three mice; these comparisons are not statistically significant), and the axonal processes they encase are thinner (areas of EM cross sections of axon terminals at guard hairs: 2.33 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>, 5 axon sections from two mice; awl/auchene hairs: 0.76 \u00b1 0.05 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>, 10 axon sections from two mice, p=0.002 compared with guard hairs; zigzag hairs: 0.57 \u00b1 0.10 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>, 19 axon sections from three mice, p=0.001 compared with guard hairs). In addition, the gaps between TSC processes that expose the axonal endings on the side of hair follicle epithelial cells are larger than those found at guard hairs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,C\u2032,D,D\u2032</a>, arrows) (widths of gaps of TSC processes toward guard hair follicles: 82.8 \u00b1 13.9 nm, 7 axon sections from two mice; awl/auchene hair follicles: 162.9 \u00b1 11.9 nm, 22 axon sections from two mice, p=0.05 compared with guard hairs; zigzag hair follicles: 196.6 \u00b1 11.9 nm, 35 axon sections from three mice, p=0.01 compared with guard hairs). Interestingly, at awl/auchene and zigzag follicles, adjacent LTMR axonal endings often share the same TSC process; this was rarely observed for A\u03b2 RA-LTMR endings at guard hairs. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> shows one such example in which three adjacent axon terminals associated with an awl/auchene hair follicle intervene among four TSC processes and appear bound together within a single unit. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> shows another example at a zigzag hair follicle, in which two adjacent axon terminals are tightly associated with three TSC processes to form a single unit (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, lower left corner). An additional, distinguishing feature of lanceolate complexes at awl/auchene and zigzag hair follicles, compared to those at guard hairs, is that the ultrastructural properties of the lanceolate axons are heterogeneous. Indeed, some axons contain many mitochondria, similar to the A\u03b2 RA-LTMR endings at guard hair follicles, whereas others contain few mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). This ultratructural feature of axon terminals is observed across more than 30 serial EM sections, which spans more than 3 \u03bcm along the longitudinal axis of a lanceolate complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Since lanceolate complexes at awl/auchene hair follicles are triply innervated by A\u03b2 RA-, A\u03b4-, and C-LTMRs while those at zigzag hair follicles are innervated by A\u03b4- and C-LTMRs, axons exhibiting different abundances of mitochondria may derive from distinct LTMR subtypes. Thus, the cellular and ultrastructural properties of lanceolate complexes differ among the hair follicle subtypes, and these differences may underlie unique sensitivities or responses of each LTMR subtype following skin indentation or hair deflection."

Axon terminals are pseudo-colored in green; TSC processes are colored in pink; the hair follicle epithelial cell is colored in yellow. Each unit is composed of one axonal terminal encased by two or three TSC processes on three sides. Axon terminals contain a large number of mitochondria. Note that small protrusions of axons (arrows) and TSC processes are precisely aligned against the basal lamina of the hair follicle. (<b>C</b>) A cross section of a lanceolate complex of an awl/auchene hair follicle. Each axon terminal is encased by two TSC processes on two sides. More than one axonal ending and its associated TSC processes is often packed into a single \u2018unit\u2019. Shown here is one unit composed of three axon terminals intervening among four TSC processes. Compared to guard hair follicles, awl/auchene hair follicles exhibit more area of exposed axon terminal membrane facing the outer root sheath cell of the follicle (arrow). In addition, TSC processes are thicker than those at guard hair follicles, while axon diameters are smaller. Also, the axon terminals appear heterogeneous: some have few mitochondria (the middle axon) and some many mitochondria (the other two axons). (<b>D</b>) A cross section of a lanceolate complex associated with a zigzag hair follicle. Similar to awl/auchene hair follicles, each axon terminal is encased by two TSC processes on two sides. One of the units in the lower left corner is composed of two axon terminals encased by three TSC processes. As with the awl/auchene complexes, and in comparison to guard hairs, areas of exposed axon terminal membrane adjacent to the hair follicle epithelial cell are large (arrows). In addition, similar to awl/auchenes, the zigzag TSC processes are thicker and axonal sections are smaller compared to guard hair follicles.

We found that <i>Wnt1-Cre;TrkA</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup> mice, in which the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor gene <i>TrkA (Nrtk1)</i> is selectively ablated in DRG neurons and other cells of neural crest origin, display a complete loss of C-LTMRs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,A\u2032</a>). Unexpectedly, lanceolate endings of A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs at awl/auchene and guard hair follicles are also missing in <i>Wnt1-Cre;TrkA</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,B\u2032</a>), although A\u03b2 RA-LTMR neurons labeled by Npy2r-GFP are still present in DRGs (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, C-LTMR and A\u03b2 RA-LTMR endings in the skin are dependent on NGF\u2013TrkA signaling for development. In contrast, the axonal endings of A\u03b4-LTMRs at both awl/auchene and zigzag hair follicles remain intact in these mutant mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,C\u2032</a>). Therefore, by visualizing lanceolate complexes at zigzag hairs by EM in control and <i>Wnt1-Cre;TrkA</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup> animals, we can distinguish between the C-LTMR endings that are missing in <i>Wnt1-Cre;TrkA</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup> mutants, and A\u03b4-LTMRs endings that are intact. Interestingly, while axons associated with zigzag hair follicles in control mice have variable numbers of mitochondria, nearly all of the axons at zigzag hair follicles in <i>Wnt1-Cre;TrkA</i><sup><i>f/f</i></sup> mice exhibit a high density of mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Assuming that the <i>TrkA</i> mutation has no effect on mitochondria density in A\u03b4-LTMR axonal terminals, this finding indicates that the lanceolate endings with few mitochondria belong to C-LTMRs while those with abundant mitochondria belong to A\u03b4-LTMRs or A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F\u2013H</a>)."

In particular, numerous small vesicles are located within the cytoplasm of lanceolate endings of all LTMR subtypes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>, arrows). Recent studies suggest that these are glutamate-containing vesicles, which may mediate communication with TSCs and thereby regulate lanceolate complex assembly and maintenance (<a href=\"#bib50\">Woo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Banks et al., 2013</a>). Additionally, many pinocytotic vesicles are associated with both the inner and outer surfaces of TSC processes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>, arrowheads). Similar observations have been made for lanceolate complexes of hair follicles from facial skin or ear hairy skin in mouse, rat, and humans (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yamamoto, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cauna, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hashimoto, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kaidoh and Inoue, 2000</a>), although the sensory neuron subtype under investigation in those studies was not known. Additionally, a network of longitudinally-oriented collagen fibers can be observed in the extracellular space between lanceolate endings and basement membrane of the follicle and appear as circular structures in EM cross-sections (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, arrow). Another network of horizontally oriented collagen fibers appear as stripes around longitudinal lanceolate endings in the outer circle, presumably surrounding circumferential endings (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, arrowhead) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Low, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Parakkal, 1969</a>).

Intriguingly, there is an abundance of prominent hemidesmosomes located along the outer membranes of the outer root sheath epithelial cells of the three hair follicle subtypes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013G</a>, white arrow heads). Fine filament-like structures emanate from these hemidesmosomes, pass through the basal lamina, and appear to form direct contacts with the membranes of A\u03b2 RA-LTMR, A\u03b4-LTMR, and C-LTMR lanceolate axonal endings as well as TSC processes. These tether-like filaments are approximately 100 nm in length and may be similar to anchoring filaments or anchoring fibrils, which are essential components of dermo\u2013epidermal junctions connecting basal keratinocytes with dermal cell types (<a href=\"#bib28\">Keene et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Regauer et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Burgeson and Christiano, 1997</a>). It is tempting to speculate that these filamentous connections between hair follicle epithelial cells and both LTMR lanceolate endings and TSCs are involved in assembly, maintenance, or mechanotransduction at lanceolate complexes. Consistent with the latter, 100-nm long, tether-like structures were observed in DRG sensory neurons grown in cell culture, where they may be required for mechanosensitive currents of DRG sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hu et al., 2010</a>)."

                                "text": "The intricate structural relationship between LTMRs and TSCs suggests that both cells types are essential for function and maintenance of lanceolate complexes at guard, awl/auchene, and zigzag hair follicles. However, the relative contributions of LTMRs and TSCs for the maintenance of lanceolate complex integrity are unknown. To address this, we first examined the integrity of LTMR axonal terminals following genetic ablation of Schwann cells. We crossed the glial-specific <i>Plp1</i><sup><i>CreER</i></sup> mouse line to the <i>Rosa26</i><sup><i>hDTR</i></sup> reporter line, which expresses the human diphtheria toxin receptor (hDTR) in a Cre-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buch et al., 2005</a>). <i>Plp1</i><sup><i>CreER</i></sup><i>;Rosa26</i><sup><i>hDTR</i></sup> animals were treated with tamoxifen at P16 to activate Cre recombinase and thus glial cell-specific expression of hDTR. These animals were then subjected to injections of DTX at P24 and P27, which results in selective ablation of hDTR-expressing cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Saito et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cavanaugh et al., 2009</a>). We observed efficient ablation of TSCs at hair follicles in DTX-treated <i>Plp1</i><sup><i>CreER</i></sup><i>;Rosa26</i><sup><i>hDTR</i></sup> animals, compared to DTX-treated control animals (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). In these experiments, TSCs were visualized using tdTomato fluorescence in animals harboring the <i>Rosa26</i><sup><i>tdTomato</i></sup> allele (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Remarkably, 100% of the hair follicles lacking TSCs exhibited a complete loss of longitudinal lanceolate endings and a partial loss of circumferential endings labeled by Tuj1 and NFH immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,A\u2032,B,B\u2032</a>). A partial loss of CGRP<sup>+</sup> circumferential endings was also observed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,C\u2032</a>). These findings indicate that LTMR axon terminals retract from hair follicles following ablation of TSCs. The disappearance of longitudinal lanceolate endings is coincident with degeneration of TSCs, while circumferential lanceolate endings are more resilient and remain in the absence of TSCs (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The partial loss of CGRP<sup>+</sup> circumferential axons in the absence of TSCs may be due to instability of sensory\u2013neural complexes at hair follicles that results from the loss of TSCs and LTMR lanceolate endings. The PLP gene is expressed in almost all glial subtypes in the periphery (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jessen and Mirsky, 2005</a>). Due to limitations of our genetic tools, we cannot further assess the contributions of other glial cell types, such as myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells to the anchoring of LTMR endings at hair follicles. However, the fact that LTMR longitudinal lanceolate endings at hair follicles are severely affected regardless of whether they are heavily myelinated (A\u03b2 RA-LTMR), lightly myelinated (A\u03b4-LTMR) or unmyelinated (C-LTMR), whereas unmyelinated free nerve endings remain relatively intact (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,A\u2032</a>, white squares), strongly suggests that TSCs play a major role in maintaining the integrity of lanceolate complexes at hair follicles."

To denervate hair follicles in back hairy skin, dorsal cutaneous nerves that innervate the right side of the back of adult animals were severed, while nerves innervating the left side remained intact, providing a control. As expected, 17 days following surgery, cutaneous nerves innervating the right, surgically denervated side of the animal had completely degenerated (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2032</a>), whereas cutaneous innervation of the left, control side was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Strikingly, TSCs, labeled by S100 immunostaining, remained intact and in close association with hair follicles in the absence of LTMR endings (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,B\u2032</a>). Even 44 days following skin denervation, TSCs at denervated hair follicles remained intact (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,C\u2032,D,D\u2032,E,E\u2032</a>). In contrast, both Schwann cells associated with circumferential axonal terminals at hair follicles (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D,D\u2032</a>; white arrow) and myelinating Schwann cells in the dermis, visualized by S100 and MBP immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E,E\u2032</a>), had degenerated in the absence of cutaneous nerves. Similar observations were made when TSCs were genetically labeled using <i>Plp1</i><sup><i>CreER</i></sup><i>;Rosa26</i><sup><i>GCaMP3</i></sup> mice that had received tamoxifen treatment \u2018prior\u2019 to surgical denervation. As in the aforementioned S100 immunostaining experiments, GFP immunostaining of skin sections (to detect GCaMP3) showed that TSCs that were genetically labeled prior to denervation are morphologically intact following surgical denervation of the skin (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F,F\u2032</a>). In addition, GFP<sup>+</sup> Schwann cells that did not express either S100 or MBP were also observed in the dermis, indicating the presence of PLP-expressing immature Schwann cells that may function to regenerate myelin sheaths (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F\u2032</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We quantified the number of TSCs at individual guard hair and non-guard hair follicles (awl/auchene and zigzag hairs combined) 5 weeks following skin denervation. This quantitative assessment revealed that, despite complete loss of cutaneous LTMR endings on the denervated side of the animal, comparable numbers of TSCs were present at hair follicles on control and denervated sides (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>). Therefore, TSCs associated with A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs, A\u03b4-LTMRs, and C-LTMRs, maintain both their location and structural integrity in the absence of axonal processes in adult mice, for at least several weeks."

In contrast to 7 days after denervation, where few fibers were seen in the denervated skin, by 33 days after denervation, approximately 70% of the denervated skin had been innervated (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>). The majority of re-innervation most likely derives from axons that had regenerated from the severed dorsal cutaneous nerves (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jackson and Diamond, 1984</a>). For the skin regions close to the edges of the denervated territory, the re-innervating fibers may also derive from adjacent intact nerves. Re-innervation in the center of the denervated skin was least robust, which may due to the long distance between that skin region and the cut sites of T9 and T10 dorsal cutaneous nerves (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Nevertheless, re-innervation of most skin regions was prominent by 33 days after denervation (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). This finding of re-innervation of denervated hair follicles, together with the observation that TSCs are remarkably stable following skin denervation, prompted us to ask whether TSCs that are associated with LTMR lanceolate complexes prior to denervation, and remain following denervation, become re-innervated by sprouting or regenerating LTMR axons. To test this possibility, TSCs were genetically labeled using <i>Plp1</i><sup><i>CreER</i></sup><i>;Rosa26</i><sup><i>GCaMP3</i></sup> animals and tamoxifen application prior to denervation. TSCs and axonal processes in denervated back skin were then observed using GFP and Tuj1 double immunostaining at different time points after the surgery. In control hair follicles on the non-denervated side of the back skin, longitudinal lanceolate endings were associated with TSC processes and formed typical, intricate longitudinal lanceolate complexes at guard hair and non-guard hair follicles; circumferential endings were also observed surrounding these longitudinal lanceolate complexes at all hair follicles (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). On the denervated side of the back skin, though most longitudinal lanceolate endings were still absent three weeks following skin denervation, prominent re-innervation of guard hair follicles in the form of thick circumferential endings and occasional longitudinal lanceolate endings is readily observed (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>, arrow). A lesser amount of re-innervation in the form of circumferential endings was also seen at this time point in surrounding non-guard hair follicles (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). 1 week later, at week four following skin denervation, prominent circumferential and longitudinal axonal endings were readily observed at the re-innervated guard hair follicles (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>). Circumferential endings were also observed in the surrounding non-guard hair follicles at this time point. At 5 weeks following denervation, sensory endings associated with re-innervated guard hair follicles were morphologically comparable to those in control skin (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10F</a>). Overall, approximately 90% of hair follicles exhibited at least some re-innervation by 5 weeks after denervation. Lanceolate complexes at guard hairs have considerably more advanced recovery compared to non-guard hair follicles. Most non-guard hair follicles, especially zigzag hair follicles, display only sparse circumferential endings at this stage (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10F</a>). We also addressed the specificity of axonal re-innervation of TSC complexes. For this, skin denervation experiments were done using <i>Npy2r-GFP</i> mice, in which A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs are labeled with GFP (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2011</a>). In control skin, whole-mount immunostaining using anti-GFP confirmed previous findings that, as expected for A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2011</a>), Npy2r-GFP<sup>+</sup> axon terminals form longitudinal lanceolate endings associated with guard and awl/auchene, but not zigzag hair follicles (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10G</a>, white arrowheads). Remarkably, 83 days following denervation, Npy2r-GFP<sup>+</sup> axons had re-innervated awl/auchene and guard hair follicles in the denervated skin region (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10H</a>, white arrowheads). While some of the A\u03b2 RA-LTMR axon terminals exhibited simple circumferential endings around hair follicles at this time point and excess sprouting of GFP<sup>+</sup> axons innervating adjacent zigzag hair follicles was occasionally seen, the majority of GFP<sup>+</sup> axons had developed typical longitudinal lanceolate endings associated with the denervated guard and awl/auchene hairs. In summary, lanceolate complex TSCs remain intact and tightly associated with hair follicles following skin denervation. Furthermore, these intact TSCs become re-associated with the lanceolate endings of regenerated LTMRs, and the specificity of the LTMR subtype/hair follicle relationship is largely if not completely preserved, at least for A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs, following re-innervation. This observation raises the intriguing possibility that TSCs, which remain intact following nerve injury, serve to attract axonal endings of specific LTMR subtypes to restore proper structure and organization of A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs, A\u03b4-LTMRs, and C-LTMRs lanceolate complexes at the three hair follicle types."

Our findings modify this view and provide new insights into the basis of LTMR subtype properties. Guard hair follicles have the longest hair shafts and are innervated by longitudinal lanceolate endings belonging exclusively to A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs. If, as we believe, LTMR lanceolate endings and their associated TSC processes serve as detectors of hair follicle deflection, then guard hair follicles are armed with many more such detectors, displaying fewer but longer processes, compared to those associated with zigzag and awl/auchene hair follicles. Thus, the unique cellular and morphological properties of guard hair lanceolate complexes may endow guard hair-associated A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs with unique functions or response properties during hair movement. On the other hand, our analysis of awl/achene and zigzag hair follicles indicates that cellular and morphological differences of longitudinal lanceolate complexes are unlikely to account for the unique physiological properties of A\u03b2 RA-, A\u03b4-, and C-LTMRs at these hair follicle subtypes. Our mosaic genetic labeling of lanceolate complex TSCs shows that these cells are tiled at individual hair follicles and that the processes of adjacent TSCs do not overlap. Importantly, at both awl/auchene and zigzag hair follicles, a single TSC plays host to interdigitated axonal endings of two or more LTMR subtypes. Thus, while A\u03b2 RA-, A\u03b4-, and C-LTMRs exhibit markedly different rates of adaptation to sustained stimuli, their axons form strikingly similar longitudinal lanceolate endings, they can innervate the same hair follicle and, as shown here for awl/auchene and zigzag hair follicles, they can even share the same TSC. These findings provide strong support for a model, in which the unique physiological properties and adaptation rates of A\u03b2 RA-, A\u03b4-, and C-LTMRs associated with awl/auchene and zigzag hair follicles are due to intrinsic neuronal differences rather than unique end organ cell types or morphologies."

Extensive light and electron microscopic analyses of lanceolate complexes were reported beginning in the 1960s (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yamamoto, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cauna, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Halata, 1993</a>). These previous studies, together with findings of the present study, indicate that the general morphology of lanceolate complexes associated with hair follicles from different body regions and between different species is highly conserved. In this study, for the first time, we report EM analysis that defines the ultrastructural properties of A\u03b2 RA-LTMR, A\u03b4-LTMR, and C-LTMR lanceolate complexes and their associations with the three main hair follicle types; guard, awl/auchene, and zigzag hair follicles. Our analysis revealed that the ultrastructural properties of A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs, A\u03b4-LTMRs, and C-LTMRs and their TSC processes associated with awl/auchene and zigzag hair follicles are remarkably similar. On the other hand, A\u03b2 RA-LTMR endings associated with guard hair follicles are distinct, having larger caliber lanceolate axonal endings and slightly thinner TSC processes compared to those of A\u03b2 RA-, A\u03b4-, and C-LTMRs associated with awl/auchene and zigzag hair follicles. In addition, at awl/auchene and zigzag hair follicles, two or more axonal endings, which differ in mitochondrial abundance and belong to different LTMR subtypes, are often observed alternately arranged with three or more TSC processes, forming individual groups or \u2018units\u2019. Thus, axon terminals of different LTMR subtypes can share the same set of TSC processes to form \u2018lanceolate complex units\u2019 at awl/auchene and zigzag hair follicles, which together comprise \u223c99% of trunk skin hairs. Such an arrangement was never observed at guard hairs; at guard hairs, each A\u03b2 RA-LTMR lanceolate ending associates with three TSC processes to form stereotypical \u2018guard hair lanceolate complex units\u2019. Thus, A\u03b2 RA-LTMR lanceolate complexes at guard hair follicles are morphologically invariant and more precisely arranged into confined units than A\u03b2 RA-, A\u03b4-, and C-LTMR complexes associated with awl/auchene and zigzag hairs, potentially endowing guard hair lanceolate complexes with higher fidelity or sensitivity to hair deflection."

                                "text": "The present study also defines the ultrastructural properties of lanceolate endings of the three physiologically defined LTMR subtypes that innervate hair follicles. A defining feature of A\u03b2 RA-LTMR and A\u03b4-LTMR lanceolate endings is their highly abundant mitochondria. Neurons critically depend on mitochondrial ATP production for establishing membrane excitability and for calcium buffering (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kann and Kovacs, 2007</a>), and emerging evidence suggests that mitochondria contribute to neuronal plasticity. An abundance of mitochondria in A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs and A\u03b4-LTMRs terminals may be needed to support rapid conduction velocities, a distinguishing feature of these LTMR subtypes, compared to the slow-conducting C-LTMRs, whose lanceolate endings contain few mitochondria. We also observed several ultrastructural features of A\u03b2 RA-, A\u03b4-, and C-LTMR lanceolate complexes that may be crucial to the development and maintenance of lanceolate complexes, and may also underlie their remarkable sensitivity to hair deflection. Abundant small vesicles are found within the cytoplasm of axonal terminals of all LTMR subtypes. Studies by <a href=\"#bib50\">Woo et al. (2012)</a> and <a href=\"#bib2\">Banks et al. (2013)</a> suggest that these may be glutamate-containing vesicles that mediate signals from sensory neurons to TSCs. Consistent with this idea, A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs and A\u03b4-LTMRs express VGluT1 and/or VGluT2, whereas C-LTMRs express VGluT3, suggesting that all LTMRs are glutamatergic (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brumovsky et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Seal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Woo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Banks et al., 2013</a>). Numerous pinocytotic vesicles were observed on both the inner and outer surfaces of TSC processes. These vesicle-like structures were noted previously and suggested to control ion flux around nerve fibers (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yamamoto, 1966</a>). It is also reasonable to speculate that these invaginations serve as docking sites for axon fingers of longitudinal lanceolate endings (<a href=\"#bib48\">Takahashi-Iwanaga, 2000</a>). Such an intercalating morphology increases the interaction surface area between TSC processes and LTMRs and may contribute to the mechanical sensitivity of LTMR endings. Most noteworthy, in our opinion, is the presence of intercellular processes that emanate from hemidesmosomes on outer root sheath epithelial cells of hair follicles, forming connections, or tethers, between hair follicle epithelial cells and A\u03b2 RA-, A\u03b4-, and C-LTMR axon terminals and TSC processes. These filaments resemble anchoring filaments and anchoring fibrils, reported previously in other contexts to mediate dermal\u2013epidermal adhesion (<a href=\"#bib28\">Keene et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Burgeson and Christiano, 1997</a>). At hair follicles, these filaments may contribute to assembly and maintenance of lanceolate ending-TSC-epithelial cell complexes. Intriguingly, the \u223c100-nm long filaments observed in the present study may be functionally analogous to the protein tethers described by Lewin et al. in cell culture experiments and proposed to link mechanosensitive ion channels in sensory neurons to the extracellular matrix (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hu et al., 2010</a>). We speculate that the tether-like structures we observed at hair follicles in vivo may serve to facilitate or mediate excitation of lanceolate endings following hair deflection. Thus, we propose that \u2018epithelial cell\u2013lanceolate complex tethers\u2019 serve a function that is analogous to the tip links that physically tether adjacent steroecilia of hair cells of the cochlea and vestibular apparatus and serve to open mechanically gated ion channels upon stereocilia movement. In the case of hair follicle epithelial cell\u2013lanceolate complex tethers, we speculate that deflection of hair follicles would place strain on the tethers to activate mechanically gated ion channels situated on the membrane of the LTMR lanceolate ending thus leading to their depolarization. Interestingly, a recent study from Lewin et al. suggests that laminin 332, a major component of keratinocyte-derived extracellular matrix, prevents formation of protein tethers and inhibits rapidly adapting currents, further supporting the notion that extracellular matrices play a key role in mechanotransduction (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chiang et al., 2011</a>). Potential molecular components of these tethers may include type VII collagen, a major component of anchoring fibrils, as well as other collagen proteins, laminins, and integrins, which could assemble into multimeric complexes to form tether structures (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burgeson and Christiano, 1997</a>). Future studies will be needed to define the molecular components of these epithelial cell\u2013lanceolate complex tethers. Once defined, tissue-specific ablation of key components, coupled with histological and physiological analyses, should reveal the contribution of these tethers for the assembly and maintenance of lanceolate complexes and/or their role in mechanotransduction during hair movement or deflection."

Indeed, we found that LTMR endings rapidly retract from hair follicles following TSC ablation. And yet, surprisingly, when LTMR endings are lost following a nerve cut, TSCs remain intact and intimately associated with hair follicles. In fact, TSCs of adult mice are remarkably stable in the absence of nerve, for at least several weeks or even months. This effect may be age-dependent, since we found that TSCs are less stable and often degenerate during the 2 weeks following skin denervation of neonates (data not shown). Thus, at neonatal ages, when lanceolate complexes are developing, LTMR axonal endings may be necessary for the maintenance of newly formed TSCs. Consistent with this, it was recently reported that TSCs associated with neonatal hair follicles are disorganized in <i>Wnt1Cre</i>-mediated VGLUT2 mutant mice, suggesting that neuronal glutamate signaling is required for proper organization of TSCs during lanceolate complex development (<a href=\"#bib50\">Woo et al., 2012</a>). However, in the same study, blocking glutamatergic signaling through systemic administration of an NMDAR antagonist disrupts TSC structures at hair follicles in adult animals, which is different from our conclusion that sensory nerves are not required for maintenance of TSCs at hair follicles in adult animals. One potential explanation for this discrepancy is that glutamatergic signaling from cells other than LTMRs is needed to maintain TSC processes. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that TSCs serve as anchors or scaffolds that maintain LTMR endings and lanceolate complex structure and integrity, whereas LTMR axonal endings of adult mice are not required for maintenance of TSCs."

Moreover, the pattern of axonal innervation of hair follicles during regeneration exhibits similarities to that which is observed during development. In particular, guard hair follicles are the first to be re-innervated. At individual hair follicles, circumferential endings form first, surrounding TSC processes, and this is followed by gradual formation of longitudinal lanceolate endings during the next several days. This is comparable to the pattern of LTMR lanceolate complex formation observed during development of neonatal animals (data not shown) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Peters et al., 2002</a>). Furthermore, LTMR-hair follicle subtype specificity appears conserved, at least for A\u03b2 RA-LTMRs, during re-innervation. It is likely that the developmental and regeneration processes that govern LTMR lanceolate ending branching, extension, orientation, size, and TSC association have common mechanisms. Additionally, the precise role played by TSCs during the re-innervation of hair follicles is an intriguing question. During regeneration of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) following axotomy, TSCs proliferate extensively and serve to guide motor axons to their destination by expressing some of the same cues that are used during development (<a href=\"#bib40\">Reynolds and Woolf, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</a>). TSCs at hair follicles may serve a similar role to attract specific subtypes of spouting LTMR axons to re-form lanceolate complexes. Future work will define the significance and molecular mechanisms underlying the intimate relationship between LTMR subtype longitudinal lanceolate endings and TSCs during formation, function, and regeneration of hair follicle-associated LTMR lanceolate complexes."

To identify the types of hair follicles innervated by each LTMR class, similar whole-mount preparations of hairy skin were made without removing the hair. Using a confocal microscope, hair follicles were traced to the corresponding hair shafts. The number of rows of medulla cells in the hair shaft was counted to distinguish zigzag (1 row), awl/auchene (3 or 4 rows) and guard hairs (2 rows)."

All tissue samples were then stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 2 hr, dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in Epon. Toluidin blue-stained transverse sections of the hair follicles were made to determine the location of lanceolate endings and the positions for collecting ultrathin sections. Transverse thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate followed by examinations with Philips/FEI BioTwin CM120 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV."

In particular, this manuscript examines the structural organization and interactions between low threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) and terminal Schwann cells (TSCs) in mouse hairy skin. The authors use immunohistochemistry, EM and a diverse array of genetic tools that label different subsets of LTMRs or TSCs to understand how TSCs interact with distinct hair follicles and LTMR subtypes. The authors show that TSCs are organized in a mosaic or tiled fashion and interact with multiple subtypes of LTMR endings. In addition, the data show that conditional ablation of TSCs induces the retraction of LTMRs from hair follicles, while denervation has no gross effect on TSC organization. A particular strength of the manuscript is that the morphological and physiological organization of the terminal Schwann cell (TSC) has been investigated for the first time in detail. Overall the data are high quality and the manuscript is well written. However, a number of questions remain about some of the methodology, mouse lines used in the study, statistical comparisons, and interpretation of the data."

For example, based on qualitative data, the authors state \u2018the organization of individually tiled TCSs and different LTMR endings can be visualized simply by immunostaining with glial markers.\u2019 This method is then used in subsequent experiments. Providing quantification for the former observation would enhance confidence in the latter method. Also, in several instances, means are stated to be higher or lower without statistical comparisons. As a second example, the authors state that sparse labeling of TSCs shows multiple TSCs around each hair follicle but that their processes do not overlap with one another. The figure shows an example of one guard hair and one non-guard hair. It is not clear how many follicles were tested. The text states that 4 mice were used, but the actual number of follicles counted and the percentage of tiled TSCs would help illustrate the robustness of this organization that example images do not capture. As a third example, the mean cross sectional areas of axon terminals are given. The n is given as two mice but no information is given on the number of sections or number of lanceolates examined."

This is surprising. Are the sensory cells still present? <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> does not show a complete loss of fiber innervation. Has this mouse been characterized previously or is this the first report? What are the relative percentages of fibers in control versus mutant animals? Are the TSCs present with normal processes? Do the TSCs still interact normally with the A\u03b4-LTMRs in the mutant mouse? We realize that this mutant line is being used as a tool here, but some background on the phenotype is needed. The authors should mention the possibility that plasticity may occur here (TrkB positive D-hair afferents changing their innervation in the absence of other lanceolates?)."

In the methods the authors state that the nerve was cut but give no further information. Normally cutting a peripheral nerve in situ will allow axons to regrow to the skin with relatively fast time course (in the mouse this is 4\u20136 weeks). Therefore the re-innervation that the authors see could be simply due to the reinnervation by the cut nerve rather than by collateral sprouting. If the authors had ligated the nerve this would favor the collateral sprouting model. The authors should clarify this issue. Were manipulations made to prevent regeneration of the cut nerve or not? The authors should exercise caution in their interpretation of this data. In the end it may not make a difference if follicles are re-innervated collaterally or by regrowing axons, but the majority of the literature spanning many decades is pretty clear about the fact that large diameter low threshold afferents tend not to produce much, if any collateral sprouting (experiments started by Henry Head in the 1900s and confirmed by many afterwards). If the authors really want to challenge this body of literature they need better experimental evidence and should provide it."

Additional data should be provided for the neuronal ablation section to better substantiate the claims. How many follicles are reinnervated? Does innervation of all subtypes of follicles re-form? This is important as a number of studies have proposed a role for neuronal signaling in Schwann cell development and maintenance. Indeed, <a href=\"#bib50\">Woo et al. (2012)</a> suggest a model of TSCs being dependent on neuronal glutamate signaling for development and maintenance of the follicular structure. These studies should be discussed."

Nat Neuro 2011). However, there is no reason to favor Col7a1 protein as opposed to numerous others (many large extracellular proteins are in the skin) as a tether for mechanotransduction. Staining for Col7a1 may be interesting but even positive light microscopy findings would not make this protein a better candidate than others. The manuscript would be strengthened by presenting a balanced view of candidates or by including additional experiments to support the Col7a1 model."

It would be interesting to know whether response properties different in afferents innervating guard versus awl/auchene hairs. An alternative interpretation is that these structural differences are simply a consequence of distinct development in primary (guard) hair follicles versus secondary follicles."

Banks and colleagues (2013; J. Physiol. 15:2523-2540) reported that small clear-core vesicles in lanceolate terminals are enriched in glutamate. Examples shown by Banks et al. are quite similar to guard-hair lanceolate endings presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>. Woo et al. (2012; Development 139:740-748) found that TSCs are disorganized around neonatal hair follicles in Wnt1-driven VGLUT2 knockout mice. As VGLUT2 is expressed in lanceolate terminals but not TSCs, these data imply that DRG-derived signals are required for proper development of TSCs. It would be helpful to discuss this study\u2019s finding that TSC structure persists in denervated tissue in light of these previous reports."

From the revision, it seems that the authors inferred these identities in wildtype mice based on the 1) the appearance of endings with two different mitochondrial densities in wild type mice, and 2) on the loss of endings with low mitochondrial density in the TrkA conditional knockout mice, which also lack C fibers. This indirect method relies on the assumption that the TrkA mutation has no effect on mitochondrial density in A\u03b4 fibers."

Providing quantification for the former observation would enhance confidence in the latter method. Also, in several instances, means are stated to be higher or lower without statistical comparisons.

Therefore the re-innervation that the authors see could be simply due to the reinnervation by the cut nerve rather than by collateral sprouting. If the authors had ligated the nerve this would favor the collateral sprouting model. The authors should clarify this issue. Were manipulations made to prevent regeneration of the cut nerve or not? The authors should exercise caution in their interpretation of this data. In the end it may not make a difference if follicles are re-innervated collaterally or by regrowing axons, but the majority of the literature spanning many decades is pretty clear about the fact that large diameter low threshold afferents tend not to produce much, if any collateral sprouting (experiments started by Henry Head in the 1900s and confirmed by many afterwards).

This is worth clarifying because the goal was to compare ultrastructure of \u2018individually defined endings\u2019. From the revision, it seems that the authors inferred these identities in wildtype mice based on the 1) the appearance of endings with two different mitochondrial densities in wild type mice, and 2) on the loss of endings with low mitochondrial density in the TrkA conditional knockout mice, which also lack C fibers.

As the Reviewing Editor points out, our method relies on the assumption that mitochondrial density and the electron dense nature of A\u03b4-LTMR endings does not undergo a dramatic change in <i>TrkA</i> conditional knockout mice. We think this is a reasonable assumption because A\u03b4-LTMR LTMRs do not express TrkA. We have modified the sentence on page 9 to read: Assuming that the <i>TrkA</i> mutation has no effect on mitochondria density in A\u03b4- LTMR axonal terminals, this finding indicates that the lanceolate endings with few mitochondria belong to C-LTMRs while those with abundant mitochondria belong to A\u03b4-LTMRs or A\u03b2 RA- LTMRs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F-H</a>)."

Without an independent marker, it makes more sense to me to plot the data from each hair-follicle type as a single population with a bimodal distribution.

Indeed, as predicted, there is a clear bimodal distribution of mitochondrial density in LTMR endings associated with Zigzag and Awl/auchene hairs of wild-type mice while, in contrast, there is a unimodal distribution corresponding to the upper \u201chump\u201d in endings associated with Zigzag hairs. Thus, endings with few mitochondria are entirely missing in the TrkA conditional mutants. This is the basis of our argument that endings with few mitochondria belong to C-LTMRs, which are missing in TrkA mutants, whereas those with abundant mitochondria belong to A\u03b4-LTMRs. A new figure showing these distribution data now replaces the older version of <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 2</a>."
