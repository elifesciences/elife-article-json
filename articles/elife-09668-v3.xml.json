Schemas are facilitated by a distributed system that stores components separately, presumably in the form of inter-connected neocortical representations. During retrieval, these components need to be recombined into one representation, but where exactly such recombination takes place is unclear. Thus, we asked where different schema components are neuronally represented and converge during retrieval. Subjects acquired and retrieved two well-controlled, rule-based schema structures during fMRI on consecutive days. Schema retrieval was associated with midline, medial-temporal, and parietal processing. We identified the multi-voxel representations of different schema components, which converged within the angular gyrus during retrieval. Critically, convergence only happened after 24-hour-consolidation and during a transfer test where schema material was applied to novel but related trials. Therefore, the angular gyrus appears to recombine consolidated schema components into one memory representation."

Schemas are facilitated by a distributed system that stores components separately, presumably in the form of inter-connected neocortical representations. During retrieval, these components need to be recombined into one representation, but where exactly such recombination takes place is unclear. Thus, we asked where different schema components are neuronally represented and converge during retrieval. Subjects acquired and retrieved two well-controlled, rule-based schema structures during fMRI on consecutive days. Schema retrieval was associated with midline, medial-temporal, and parietal processing. We identified the multi-voxel representations of different schema components, which converged within the angular gyrus during retrieval. Critically, convergence only happened after 24-hour-consolidation and during a transfer test where schema material was applied to novel but related trials. Therefore, the angular gyrus appears to recombine consolidated schema components into one memory representation."

This makes learning new things that are related to a schema, as well as remembering this knowledge, easier. The process of making these mental connections is thought to involve an extensive brain network.

The combination of these separate types of information formed a mental schema that could be used as a \u201cweather forecast\u201d. The design of the experiment meant that measuring the brain activity of the volunteers during the task (using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging) allowed the brain regions involved in retrieving the different parts of such a schema to be distinguished."

Retrieving which weather conditions the circle pairs represented activated a network of regions in the volunteers\u2019 brains. Further analysis revealed that some of these regions showed specific activity patterns in response to remembering information about only one element of the task (for example, only the rules or only the visual information). However, the different aspects of the task all appeared to be integrated by a brain region called the angular gyrus. This suggests that the angular gyrus is responsible for combining separate memory parts and pieces of information into a single representation. It is able to do so by connecting to brain regions that code for such specific aspects, although this only occurs 24 hours after the mental schemas have been established."

So far, attempts to operationalize schemas spanned an entire spectrum, ranging widely from simple, rule-like associations (if A-B, and B-C, then A-C; <a href=\"#bib31\">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</a>), and more complex visuo-spatial layouts (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tse et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">van Buuren et al., 2014</a>), to pre-existing real-world knowledge (students remember new study material related to their own field better than material from other disciplines; <a href=\"#bib52\">van Kesteren et al., 2014</a>). Considering this spectrum of complexity, it remains an empirical question whether there is a clear border between simple sets of rules and schemas and if so, where this border should be drawn (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kroes and Fernandez, 2012</a>). Regardless of these various definitions, schema memories are thought to be facilitated by a distributed system that stores components as separate \"units\" (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bartlett, 1932</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Schacter et al., 1998</a>), or \"features\" (<a href=\"#bib49\">van Kesteren et al., 2010a</a>), and that relies on inter-connected networks of neocortical representations (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wang and Morris, 2010</a>). By the same token, this argues for the need to converge information in order to recombine associative schema components upon retrieval.

Second, we probed the functional coupling of these regions as they form a memory retrieval network. Third, and most importantly, we identified the distributed representations of schema components and tested where such representations would converge. We defined schemas as sets of conceptual, rule-based associations (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kumaran et al., 2009</a>), and reasoned that this approach would provide us with a well-controlled vehicle to establish the nature of schema-related retrieval in humans."

These schemas were incorporated into a modified, deterministic weather prediction task (<a href=\"#bib20\">Knowlton et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kumaran et al., 2009</a>) in which subjects had learned that colored circle pairs predicted specific but fictive weather outcomes (\u201csun\u201d, \u201crain\u201d), depending on the location (spatial schema) or color (non-spatial schema) of one of the circles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; for a detailed description please see <b>Materials and methods, Material and task</b>). Crucially, our controlled design allowed us to independently capture the different schema components. During retrieval, visually presented circle pairs had to be combined with abstract rule-based information and could thus be used to predict specific trial outcomes. The combination of these different levels of information formed a simple schema. Therefore, the schema components consisted of (1) rule-based associations, and (2) low-level visual features of the task material (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Considering whole-brain characteristics rather than zooming into the functional properties of isolated regions, we employed a combination of activation, connectivity, and multi-voxel pattern analyses. We hypothesized that schema retrieval would primarily engage neocortical midline structures, such as the MPFC. Further, the MPFC should act as a convergence zone that recombines the different schema components into a unique schema memory during retrieval. Additionally, if such recombination goes beyond MPFC-centered processing, we expected retrieval-related schema representations to be held by the AG."

To support this convergence, the AG should show increased functional coupling with regions that separately represent the different components.

This mask was used as a seed region. Spatial schema\u00a0retrieval (compared to the perceptual baseline) was associated with enhanced functional coupling between the left AG and its locally surrounding lateral parietal cortex. Further, we observed increased connectivity with the HC, PHC, MPFC, PCC, and fusiform gyrus (similar effects were observed for non-spatial schema\u00a0retrieval; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). Connectivity profiles between the two conditions did not differ significantly (tested with a paired-sample <i>t</i>-test). The fusiform finding appears particularly relevant, since the fusiform gyrus was shown to represent the low-level visual features of the schema material (see above, and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This corroborates our assumption that retrieval-related convergence within the AG is accomplished via increased functional connectivity among a distributed set of regions that each hold specific schema components. Moreover, the left AG was coupled to the retrieval network we identified earlier (see above, and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

To start out, we observed increased activation within MPFC, PCC, and higher-level sensory cortices during schema retrieval after 24\u2009hours (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The MPFC is considered to play a pivotal role for schema-related mnemonic function (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tse et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kroes and Fernandez, 2012</a>), which is supported by lesion studies in both rodents (<a href=\"#bib35\">Richards et al., 2014</a>) and humans (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ghosh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Warren et al., 2014</a>). Also the PCC (including precuneus and retrosplenial cortex), is regarded as central to memory processes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maguire et al., 1999</a>; for a review, see <a href=\"#bib53\">Vann et al., 2009</a>). Together, the MPFC, PCC, MTL, and AG constitute a network of brain regions that act in concert during retrieval of (episodic) memories (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rugg and Vilberg, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Watrous et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">King et al., 2015</a>). Here, we observed that this network is also associated with the retrieval of rule-based schema memories (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Considering the associative character of both, episodic and schema memory, common neural substrates seem plausible. Similar to previous schema studies with human subjects (<a href=\"#bib49\">van Kesteren et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">van Buuren et al., 2014</a>), we did not find a disengagement of hippocampal activation during retrieval of consolidated schema material. However, the hippocampus showed increased coupling with the retrieval network across days. Additionally, and in line with previous results (<a href=\"#bib42\">Takashima et al., 2009</a>), we found a decrease in hippocampal-neocortical coupling after 24\u2009hours (<b>Materials and methods, Complementary analysis: hippocampal connectivity during schema retrieval</b>)."

At the same time, such a distributed memory system argues for the need to \"bind\" information in order to merge and recombine associative schema components upon retrieval. The novel feature of our experimental design allowed us to isolate the different schema components that consisted of rule-based associations and low-level visual features of the task material, while controlling for various, potentially confounding factors (such as complexity and attentional demands; see <a href=\"#bib16\">Guerin et al., 2012</a>). We found that rule-based associations were represented in the left AG and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex \u2013 the latter potentially imposing top-down control on rule-based retrieval mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib34\">Reverberi et al., 2012</a>). Low-level visual features of the task material were represented in occipital regions, AG, and fusiform gyrus. Crucially, both schema components converged within the left AG on day 2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Their multi-voxel representations, however, generalized only partly across days (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), and the AG did not recombine schema components during retrieval on day 1 (<b>Materials and methods, Complementary analysis: AG involvement in schema retrieval on day 1</b>). That is, while low-level visual features showed shared representations between days and were detectable on day 1, representations of rule-based associations were not. Although the lower amount of retrieval trials on day 1 and the classification across two separate fMRI sessions might have affected the analyses, the coherence of our results suggests a change in the underlying representations, in particular for rule-based associations, that emerges after 24-hour-consolidation. Therefore, we conclude that the AG supports the integration of consolidated schema components during retrieval. This is corroborated by studies showing increased involvement of a parietal network in the processing of remote mnemonic content (for a review, see <a href=\"#bib15\">Gilmore et al., 2015</a>)."

This is suggested by feature-integration theory (<a href=\"#bib45\">Treisman and Gelade, 1980</a>), \"cortical binding of relational activity\" (CoBRA; a model presented by <a href=\"#bib39\">Shimamura, 2011</a>), or accounts that identify the AG as heteromodal association cortex that recombines semantic information (<a href=\"#bib4\">Binder et al., 2009</a>). A recent study by <a href=\"#bib32\">Price and colleagues (2015)</a> demonstrated that the combination of semantic concepts is modulated by activation in the left AG (e.g., more activation for meaningful than non-meaningful combinations), and that subjects with lower cortical thickness in this region perform worse in this combinatorial task (<a href=\"#bib32\">Price et al., 2015</a>). Further support for the \"binding\" notion comes from lesion studies. Typically, the impact of focal AG lesions is subtle. While patients with parietal lesions perform equally well as healthy controls in a recall task (<a href=\"#bib40\">Simons et al., 2008</a>), a disruption of angular gyrus processing by transcranial magnetic stimulation reduces confidence (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yazar et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, lesions in parietal cortex can cause so-called \"illusory-conjunctions errors\" where previously studied objects are identified, but mistakes are made when recombining information (<a href=\"#bib11\">Friedman-Hill et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kesner, 2012</a>). This pattern of findings (intact retrieval, but impaired confidence and recombination of information) might be explained by limited damage to a distributed network that stores different memory components in respective brain structures (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bartlett, 1932</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Schacter et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang and Morris, 2010</a>). In the present study, we showed that low-level visual features of the stimulus material were represented within the fusiform gyrus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Additionally, the fusiform gyrus was functionally connected to the AG (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), as well as with the remaining retrieval network (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This supports the assumption of strengthened cortico-cortical connections during schema retrieval (<a href=\"#bib26\">Marr, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</a>) that might act as a back-up in cases of AG disruption. If associative memory is truly dependent on the \"binding\" function of lateral parietal cortex, disruption should lead to an increase in memory conjunctions errors. Thus, memories should be retrieved, but 1) recombined in an incorrect manner, or 2) the combination of different memory features should not be possible at all. Future research could test this by experimentally inducing memory conjunction errors (<a href=\"#bib33\">Reinitz et al., 1992</a>)."

Also, our scan parameters were not optimized for the decoding of representations within the MTL (for example, see <a href=\"#bib17\">Hassabis et al., 2009</a>), and the repeated retrieval of schema memories might have decreased our power to detect representations in the MPFC (<a href=\"#bib58\">Woolgar et al., 2011</a>). This region, for example, was previously shown to hold remote, retrieval-related representations of specific autobiographical memories (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bonnici et al., 2012</a>). Further, hippocampal cells that were active during the encoding of contextual fear memories were shown to be reactivated during retrieval (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tanaka et al., 2014</a>). Silencing these cells rendered memory retrieval impossible. In either case, autobiographical and contextual fear memories certainly differ from more abstract schema memories. With the nature of these memory representations being so different, schema memories might simply not be represented within the MPFC, PCC, or MTL during retrieval."

However, this prior knowledge is difficult to control for as it is highly individual and thus may additionally involve self-referential, autobiographical memory processing. Here, we defined schemas as artificial sets of rules (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kumaran et al., 2009</a>). While other studies may have greater ecological validity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maguire et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">van Buuren et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">van Kesteren et al., 2014</a>), we explicitly tailored this task to enable our analysis. This constitutes a crucial and novel feature of our design. By training and testing subjects on schema material across consecutive days, we achieved near-ceiling performance that allowed us to reliably train and test a classifier. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to dissociate the multi-voxel representations of different schema components and to demonstrate their convergence during retrieval. Lastly, we show that new but related trials during the transfer test are solved by applying the schemas (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) and take this as evidence that our material provided a mental framework for subjects, allowing the rapid assimilation of new, related information (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tse et al., 2007</a>). This is an important point in which schemas differ from so-called \"task-sets\" (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sakai and Passingham, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bengtsson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Collins and Frank, 2013</a>).

According to them, the necessary features for a schema memory are: (1) an associative network structure, (2) formation on the basis of multiple episodes, (3) the lack of unit detail, and (4) adaptability. Based on these criteria, our approach provides a very basic form of schematic memory: (1) our material has an associative structure, although simple; (2) schemas are not defined based on specific episodic information, material is learned fast but across multiple instances; (3) specific features are predictive while others are not; and (4) schemas could be expanded and adapted to new material (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

As such, the left AG might fulfill a role similar to the hippocampus during the retrieval of recent episodic memories (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</a>). In essence, we substantially expand current models of memory retrieval and provide neuroimaging evidence for a mechanistic framework in which the left AG acts as a convergence zone that may support the integration of distributed schema components."

Eleven subjects were excluded from the study due to failure to learn the correct schemas after the first session. In particular, these excluded subjects made the following assumption: Encoding circle pair 3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, left part, third from top) depicts two circles in horizontal arrangement; yellow on the left, blue in the center. When applying the spatial schema, this circle pair would yield the outcome\u00a0\u201dsun\u201d. During a retrieval trial (for example, circle pair 3 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, right part, that shows a yellow circle on the upper left and a blue circle at the lower left), the correct answer should again be\u00a0\u201dsun\u201d. Thus, spatial retrieval trials can be solved by acknowledging the horizontal position of one of the circles. Instead, eleven subjects solved such trials by mentally rotating the horizontal circle pair between encoding and retrieval with a 90\u00b0 angle. Consequently, the inferred (correct) trial outcome was\u00a0\u201dsun\u201d (since \u201cthe yellow circle was placed left of the blue circle\u201d), or (incorrectly) \u201crain\u201d (since \u201cthe yellow circle was placed right of the blue circle\u201d).

Circle pairs could be solved with two different schemas regarding 1) the horizontal position of one circle (spatial schema; for example, \u201ca circle on the left predicts sun\u201d), or 2) the color of one circle (non-spatial schema; for example, \u201ca blue circle predicts rain\u201d). Thus, identical circle pairs could yield different weather outcomes when applying either spatial or non-spatial schemas (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; see <b>Materials and methods, Procedure</b> for specific instructions to the subjects). Colored circles were matched for size and color intensity, and formed two different stimulus sets (yellow, blue, red; or green, orange, pink). While one set was used for schema encoding and retrieval across day 1 and 2, the other set was presented during the transfer test at the end of day 2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

All circle pairs were presented during the experiment. During encoding trials, circles were presented in horizontal pairs. To make a clear distinction between both trial types, circles were presented in vertical pairs during retrieval. Thus, retrieval trials required the application of schematic knowledge to related information. To control for perceptual input, we created horizontal and vertical circle pairs that matched the spatial layout of encoding and retrieval trials but consisted of two-colored circles (perceptual baseline; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>).

Sessions were approximately 24\u2009hours apart (\u00b1 2\u2009hours). Prior to the first scan session subjects were instructed to pay attention to spatial or non-spatial features (\u201cThe spatial rule concerns the position of a certain object, whereas the non-spatial rule concerns the color of a certain object.\u201d) but the exact stimulus-schema-outcome mappings were not provided. Further, they received a short training and familiarization with randomized feedback. This was followed by seven runs inside the MR scanner, each lasting approximately 9 min. Each run was structured in eight blocks of five trials each, whereby two blocks of encoding trials were always followed by two blocks of retrieval trials. Encoding and retrieval blocks contained trials of either spatial or non-spatial schema types, with one perceptual control trial randomly intermixed. All runs during the experiment consisted of equal amounts of encoding and retrieval trials, spatial and non-spatial trials, and trials with\u00a0\u201dsun\"/\"rain\u201d outcomes. After completing day 1, subjects were asked to give a short written explanation of the two schemas (for example, \u201cPlease describe the spatial rule in your own words.\u201d). Additionally, subjects were shown the different circle pairs and were asked to indicate the outcomes when applying one or the other schema. Answers were scored as correct if they contained the correct association between schema, color/position, and outcome. During day 2 subjects completed seven runs of retrieval blocks only. This yielded a total of 560 trials across both sessions (280 trials on day 1, of which 140 were encoding trials; 280 retrieval trials on day 2). The transfer test took place at the end of day 2. It comprised two runs inside the MR scanner that contained both encoding and retrieval trials (same structure as on day 1, see above; 80 trials across two runs, of which 40 were encoding trials and 40 were retrieval trials). The stimulus set was changed into circle pairs with different colors while keeping the same pair-wise arrangement (<b>Materials and methods, Material and task</b>)."

Due to technical problems with the gradient multi-echo EPI sequence, only echoes from echo-times 19.9, 32, 44 ms were used for analyses. Images from multiple echo-times were combined by first performing motion correction on the first echo (19.9 ms), estimating iterative rigid body realignment to minimize the residual sum of squares between the first echo of the first scan and all remaining scans. These estimated parameters were applied to all other echoes, thereby realigning all echoes to the first echo of the first scan.

MPFC (x\u00a0=\u00a0-2, y\u00a0=\u00a035, z\u00a0=\u00a0-2) and PCC (x\u00a0=\u00a02, y\u00a0=\u00a0-45, z\u00a0=\u00a022) seeds (<b>Results, Schema retrieval networks: MPFC and PCC</b>) were defined as brain regions involved in the retrieval of consolidated schema memories (day 2 &gt; day 1; consolidation contrast, <b>Results, Schema encoding</b>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), and coordinates of peak activations were chosen considering previous effects within these regions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kumaran et al., 2009</a>), as well as anatomical boundaries (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nieuwenhuis and Takashima, 2011</a>). For these coordinates, a sphere with a radius of 8 mm was placed around the peak activations. The left AG seed (<b>Results, Schema convergence networks</b>) was delineated with a mask resulting from the convergence of schema components (1437 voxels; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The hippocampal seed region (<b>Materials and methods, Complementary analysis: hippocampal connectivity during schema retrieval</b>) was defined as bilateral hippocampus and was based on the Automatic Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas (<a href=\"http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/software/pickatlas\">http://fmri.wfubmc.edu/software/pickatlas</a>). Next, time courses of each seed region were extracted. The interaction between time course and psychological factor (i.e., spatial schema\u00a0retrieval &gt; perceptual baseline \u00d7 regional time course, and non-spatial schema\u00a0retrieval &gt; perceptual baseline \u00d7 regional time course) was computed and activity positively related to this interaction was investigated. To test for group effects on day 2, individual contrast images were entered into a second level analysis and activity explained by the PPI regressor was tested with one-sample <i>t</i>-tests. To reveal the functional network involved in general retrieval processes, irrespective of the distinct rule-based schemas, we made a second-level conjunction (logical \"and\") of both ((spatial schema retrieval &gt; perceptual baseline) \u2229 (non-spatial schema retrieval &gt; perceptual baseline); <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, and <b>6</b>, shown in purple).

Runs were modeled independently. This yielded 140 single-trial <i>t</i>-maps for day 1 and 280 single-trial <i>t</i>-maps for day 2 per subject. For the transfer test, all trials (encoding and retrieval) were included in the analysis due to the limited amount of data. This resulted in 64 single-trial <i>t</i>-maps per subject. To dissociate the distributed representations of schema components, we implemented MVPA using the library for support vector machines (LIBSVM, <a href=\"http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/\">http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/</a>).

Discrimination performance was assessed using a 7-fold cross-validation regime during which the classifier was trained on data from six runs and tested on the remaining. This was repeated until every independent run was tested once. The average discrimination performance of each searchlight was assigned to its center voxel. Additionally, we trained a classifier to determine brain regions that solely distinguished between low-level visual features of the circle pairs rather than rule-based schema representations. Visual features necessary to predict a certain trial outcome consisted of the 1) position (spatial rule), and 2) color (non-spatial rule) of one of\u00a0the circles.

Specifically, the current task could be performed by directing attention to different stimulus dimensions (color or location) depending on the explicitly indicated rule, and it is unclear how these findings would apply to situations beyond this task and thus inform our understanding of schema more generally."

This property was perhaps best articulated by Bartlett (1932), who said \u2018the past acts as an organized mass rather than as a group of elements each of which retains its specific character\u2019.\" If schemas are formed from multiple encoding episodes (and thus \"frameworks\" abstracted from specific experiences), then why is the specific low-level visual information a \"unit\" of the schema? The low-level visual MVPA analyses are likely revealing brain areas that discriminate between left/right visual fields (confounded with color: red/blue or orange/pink), so it should be clarified explicitly how this visual information would be a unit of these particular schema, why this visual content would be retrieved as part of the schema during the task (and not reflecting what is visually presented), and further, what it means for this particular visual information to be integrated/recombined with the abstracted rule during retrieval of the schema. However, aside from schemas, this finding could be interesting with respect to goal-directed/rule-based learning, particularly with regards to how abstracted rules might be integrated with perceptual information to make a decision."

Neural data from the transfer test might be particularly useful in looking at retrieval of the learned schemas, as the schemas would theoretically need to be retrieved in order to integrate the new information into the pre-existing knowledge. However, the nature of the transfer task seems like it would entail rule-updating only for the non-spatial task (learning new colors), rather than the spatial task (the left/right rule still applies); this may explain why transfer was faster for the spatial task."

Further, for each MVPA analysis (rule-based, visual) it would be informative to look into the SVM weight maps to see which voxels are more responsive for spatial vs. non-spatial trials, etc. Based on the interpretation that information about both spatial and non-spatial rules (and both visual \"categories\", e.g., left vs. right) is converging in angular gyrus, it would be helpful to show that these AG voxels are not selective for one type of information."

Further, is it warranted to treat the retrieval runs on day 2 as from 1-7? Couldn't these be interpreted as runs 8-14? Finally, for transfer test analysis (it was unclear from the methods when the transfer test occurred, presumably on day 2; was this scanned?), if trying to show that subjects were applying knowledge learned on day 1 (and thus transfer from learning on day 1), effectively using the \"schemas\" to learn more quickly, the analyses should be comparing performance on the transfer task to the relative initial learning runs from day 1, rather than within the two runs of the transfer test."

If this reveals the AG, this would clearly undermine their conclusion in relation to \"consolidated\" schema.

Considering this spectrum of complexity, it remains an empirical question whether there is a clear border between simple sets of rules, or \"task-sets\" (Sakai and Passingham, 2006; Bengtsson et al., 2009; Collins and Frank, 2013), and schemas and, if so, where this border should be drawn (Kroes and Fernandez, 2012)."

Therefore, our schema material should allow the transfer to novel information. We tested this assumption using a transfer test for the non-spatial schema at the end of day 2 (see also our response to Point 9). The results showed that subjects were able to transfer the learned schema to novel trials successfully and did so even faster than during the initial acquisition on day 1 (<a href=\"#fig13\">Author response image 2</a>). Thus, we take this as indirect evidence that material acquired on day 1 provided a framework for the more rapid acquisition of novel information during the transfer test (these new results are incorporated in the section <b>Results, Transfer test: initial schema acqiuisition vs. new learning</b>).

Here, we were able to identify representations of low-level visual features, but not of rule-based associations on day 1. Additionally, as we showed in our previous revision, schema components did only partly generalize between days. That is, while representations of low-level visual features were shared between days, representations of rule-based associations were not. We think that the coherence of these results suggests that our effects are not merely due to the separate fMRI sessions or the lower amount of retrieval trials during day 1, but due to a change in the underlying representations, in particular for the rule-based associations, that emerges after 24-hour-consolidation."
