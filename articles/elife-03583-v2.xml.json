We determined the structures of the archaeal sodium/proton antiporter MjNhaP1 in two complementary states. The inward-open state was obtained by x-ray crystallography in the presence of sodium at pH8, where the transporter is highly active. The outward-open state was obtained by electron crystallography without sodium at pH4, where MjNhaP1 is inactive. Comparison of both structures reveals a 7\u00b0 tilt of the 6 helix bundle. <sup>22</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> uptake measurements indicate non-cooperative transport with an activity maximum at pH7.5. We conclude that binding of a Na<sup>+</sup> ion from the outside induces helix movements that close the extracellular cavity, open the cytoplasmic funnel, and result in a ~5 \u00c5 vertical relocation of the ion binding site to release the substrate ion into the cytoplasm."
