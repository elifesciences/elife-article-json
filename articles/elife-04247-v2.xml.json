Upon binding to the membrane, they convert from the soluble monomeric form to oligomeric, membrane-inserted pores. Using real-time atomic force microscopy (AFM), electron microscopy (EM), and atomic structure fitting, we have mapped the structure and assembly pathways of a bacterial CDC in unprecedented detail and accuracy, focussing on suilysin from <i>Streptococcus suis</i>. We show that suilysin assembly is a noncooperative process that is terminated before the protein inserts into the membrane. The resulting ring-shaped pores and kinetically trapped arc-shaped assemblies are all seen to perforate the membrane, as also visible by the ejection of its lipids. Membrane insertion requires a concerted conformational change of the monomeric subunits, with a marked expansion in pore diameter due to large changes in subunit structure and packing."

Upon binding to the membrane, they convert from the soluble monomeric form to oligomeric, membrane-inserted pores. Using real-time atomic force microscopy (AFM), electron microscopy (EM), and atomic structure fitting, we have mapped the structure and assembly pathways of a bacterial CDC in unprecedented detail and accuracy, focussing on suilysin from <i>Streptococcus suis</i>. We show that suilysin assembly is a noncooperative process that is terminated before the protein inserts into the membrane. The resulting ring-shaped pores and kinetically trapped arc-shaped assemblies are all seen to perforate the membrane, as also visible by the ejection of its lipids. Membrane insertion requires a concerted conformational change of the monomeric subunits, with a marked expansion in pore diameter due to large changes in subunit structure and packing."

They form two branches of the largest superfamily of pore-forming proteins. Proteins of this MACPF/CDC superfamily share a common core topology of a highly bent and twisted \u03b2-sheet flanked by two \u03b1-helical regions, though lacking any detectable sequence homology between the two branches (<a href=\"#bib32\">Rosado et al., 2008</a>). Crystal structures of CDCs in their soluble, monomeric form (perfringolysin, <a href=\"#bib33\">Rossjohn et al., 1997</a>; anthrolysin, <a href=\"#bib2\">Bourdeau et al., 2009</a>; suilysin, <a href=\"#bib42\">Xu et al., 2010</a>; listeriolysin, <a href=\"#bib13\">K\u00f6ster et al., 2014</a>) revealed extended, key-shaped molecules. Pore-forming domains 1 and 3 (see also below) are linked by a long thin \u03b2-sheet (domain 2) to an immunoglobulin fold domain (4) which can bind to the membrane via a tryptophan-rich loop. CDCs form heterogeneous rings and arcs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Tilley et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sonnen et al., 2014</a>) on cholesterol-rich liposomes and lipid monolayers (for example, the CDC perfringolysin O hardly binds to membranes with &lt;30% molar concentration of cholesterol, <a href=\"#bib12\">Johnson et al., 2012</a>). Extensive biophysical and molecular analysis of CDCs established that, on CDC binding to the membrane (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ramachandran et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Hotze et al., 2012</a>), \u03b1-helical regions in domain 3 unfurl to form transmembrane \u03b2-hairpins, denoted as TMH1 and TMH2 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Shepard et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Shatursky et al., 1999</a>). If the TMH regions are trapped by introducing a disulphide bond (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hotze et al., 2001</a>), prepore oligomers are formed on the membrane surface. Cryo-EM and single particle analysis of liposome-bound CDCs led to low-resolution 3D structures of prepore and pore forms of pneumolysin, a major virulence factor of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Tilley et al., 2005</a>). These structures, as well as an AFM study of perfringolysin (<a href=\"#bib4\">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</a>), established that the 11 nm high molecule must collapse to a height of 7 nm above the membrane in order to insert the TMH regions. Simple pseudo-atomic models were obtained by fitting domains (broken at plausible hinge points) into the EM density maps. It was proposed that the long, thin \u03b2-sheet domain 2 collapses after the molecule opens up to release the TMH regions. However, because of the heterogeneity of the oligomeric assemblies and aggregation of the liposomes upon pore formation, resolution has been limited by the difficulty of obtaining sufficiently large data sets."

A disulphide-locked double cysteine mutant of suilysin, designed to prevent TMH1 insertion, enabled us to trap an active prepore state as well as to visualize the pore formation process by AFM in solution. Cryo-EM reconstruction and fitting revealed new details of the \u03b2-sheet unbending and changes in subunit packing upon conversion of prepores to pores. AFM images reveal that the prepore state is highly mobile. Following the addition of DTT to trigger insertion of the disulphide-locked prepore, time-lapse AFM yielded real-time movies of its conversion to ring and crescent-shaped pores. The observed distributions of rings and arcs can be explained by a theoretical model for kinetically trapped, noncooperative assembly, fully determined by the relative kinetics of monomer binding to the membrane and monomer assembly on the membrane surface. Together these studies provide substantial new understanding of the structure and dynamics of CDC pore formation."

Unexpectedly, the diameter of the 37-fold suilysin prepore was smaller than the diameter of the 37-fold pore (see below for quantification), indicating that conformational changes during pore formation are accompanied by changes in subunit packing."

The 3D maps, both of 37-mers, confirmed a significant expansion in ring diameter upon pore formation. In order to interpret the maps, we performed flexible fitting of suilysin domains from the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Xu et al., 2010</a>; PDB:3hvn). Domain deformations and hinge movements were identified by normal mode analysis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lindahl et al., 2006</a>). Additional evidence for the correctness of the fits followed from electrostatic potential maps and analysis of interacting residues at the interfaces of domain 1 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The results show that both models have extended regions of complementary charge on the predicted interacting surfaces. Although the extent of complementary charge is less in the pore model, in this case the oligomer is stabilized by the \u03b2-barrel of the pore. Measured from the fitted position of the base of domain 4, the prepore and pore diameters are 296 \u00c5 and 319 \u00c5, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), an expansion of 8%.

The distortion to domain 2 differs from that proposed in the earlier model (<a href=\"#bib40\">Tilley et al., 2005</a>). Seen from outside the ring, domain 2 collapses sideways, to the right, such that domain 1 is aligned above the adjacent domain 4, with a sideways tilt that expands the ring. The expansion is clearly seen in the wider spacing between subunits at domain 4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H,I</a>). Domain 2 must bend at a central hinge point to fit into the EM density (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H,I</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Reboul et al., 2014</a>). As expected, there is a major opening of the bent \u03b2-sheet. In addition, a helical subdomain flanking the bend of the central \u03b2-sheet (residues 335\u2013347, dashed oval in domain 3, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) moves as a separate rigid body, as also shown by a spectroscopic study (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ramachandran et al., 2004</a>).

Cooling appeared to reduce the prepore mobility such that individual prepore assemblies could be observed while diffusing over the membrane (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). When imaged at room temperature, suilysin prepores appeared as streaks in the AFM images\u2014as can be expected for highly mobile proteins\u2014with slightly improved contrast at the lipid phase boundaries (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). As demonstrated by real-time AFM images of the same area on the membrane, the disulphide-locked suilysin reproducibly converted from the prepore to the pore state upon exposure to DTT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>): in less than a minute, exposure to DTT triggered the appearance of diffuse rings and arcs that became progressively clearer and more prominent (bottom half of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), adopting the reduced height typical of the pore state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a>). This process was accompanied by a gradual disappearance of the diffuse streaks (i.e., suilysin prepores), while additional high (white) features appeared on the surface. We identify these features as lipid micelles or fragments being ejected from the membrane. This interpretation is supported by the subsequent appearance of larger plateaus that were consistent in height with the collapse of newly formed lipid layers on top of the membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). After about 20 min, the membrane was cleared of these features, leaving a heterogeneous population of suilysin pore assemblies perforating the membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The transition from prepore to pore, as well as the emergence and clearance of lipid aggregates, could also be observed via height profiles taken along various topographic features in these images (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>)."

As demonstrated by our oligomerization model, the measured arc-length distributions are consistent with the kinetically trapped product of a two-stage irreversible and noncooperative reaction. The outcome is largely determined by the ratio of the corresponding rate constants and the density of monomers per unit area of membrane (in addition to the effects of steric hindrance at higher surface densities). The first stage can be the binding of monomers to the membrane, as assumed here, or a rate-limiting nucleation step that triggers the oligomerization reaction, as assumed elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib10\">Hotze et al., 2001</a>). The second stage of this reaction is oligomerization by addition of monomers or very small oligomers.

Unsealed lipid edges and incomplete \u03b2-barrels are a surprising by-product of this membrane perforation by incomplete CDC oligomers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>), as was recently suggested based on electron tomography of various pneumolysin assemblies (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sonnen et al., 2014</a>)."

The resulting tilt of domain 1 results in the 8% radial expansion of the ring, clearly seen by the displacement of domain 4 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). A helical subdomain thought to be involved in triggering of sheet opening in a MACPF protein (dashed oval in domain 3, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#bib19a\">Lukoyanova et al., in press</a>) is also likely to move in suilysin, strengthening the notion that the mechanism of unfolding and pore formation is conserved between the remotely related MACPF and CDC subfamilies."

The solvent was then slowly evaporated for at least 5 hr by passing a steady stream of argon in a fume hood, yielding a dry lipid film. The lipid film was resuspended, by vigorous vortexing for 5 min, in 1 ml of 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.8, to form large, multilamellar vesicles. This solution was transferred to a Fisherbrand FB11201 bath sonicator (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK), maintained above the gel\u2013liquid transition temperature of the constituent lipids. The large multilamellar vesicles were disrupted by 15-min sonication treatments at frequencies between 40 and 80 kHz, interspersed by two freeze/thaw cycles. The solution containing the lipid dispersion was loaded into an Avanti mini-extruder kit (Avanti Polar Lipids) and kept above the transition temperature of the lipids. The lipid solution was forced through a Whatman Nucleopore polycarbonate filter (GE Healthcare Lifesciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) with an 80 nm nominal pore diameter.

These nine different \u03b2-barrel models were generated with slightly varying <i>a</i> (3.48 \u00b1 0.1 \u00c5) and <i>b</i> (4.83 \u00b1 0.1 \u00c5) bond lengths, where the value of <i>a</i> is the distance between C\u03b1 of adjacent residues in the same \u03b2-strand and <i>b</i> is the distance between C\u03b1 of adjacent residues in adjacent \u03b2-strands. This resulted in \u03b2-barrel models with modest variations of radius and height, in which the \u03b2-strands are tilted by 20\u00b0 from the pore axis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Murzin et al., 1994</a>). All the \u03b2-barrels were fitted using the Fit-in-Map tool in Chimera (<a href=\"#bib27\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Goddard et al., 2007</a>). Among the top three best-fitting \u03b2-barrels (CCC [cross-correlation coefficient] scores 0.43\u20130.44, as compared to 0.28\u20130.40 for the rest), the barrel with the height best matching the membrane was chosen by visual inspection. Next, the missing residues in the N-terminus of the native suilysin structure (PDB:3HVN) were modelled using MODELLER (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sali and Blundell, 1993</a>). Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) was used to generate rough decoys for domains 1 and 2 using the NOMAD-Ref web server (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lindahl et al., 2006</a>). 50 different decoys were obtained by randomly combining amplitudes of the first 20 modes. The value of the average coordinate root mean square deviation between the native domains and the decoys was set to 5 \u00c5."

For domain 4 (residues 388\u2013497), the crystal structure was used as the best fitting model (this domain shows very little flexibility based on NMA analysis).

Next, the map was segmented around three asymmetric units of the resulting pore model.

The PeakForce method continuously records force-distance curves with a user-defined force set-point (here about 50 pN) that is referenced to a continuously adjusted baseline. Typically, these force-distance curves were recorded at a frequency of 2 kHz with a maximum tip-sample separation between 5 and 20 nm. The topographic features were verified for consistency between trace and retrace images, as well as for their reproducibility in subsequent scan frames. For imaging, the vertical scan limit was reduced to \u223c1.5 \u03bcm. Typically, images were recorded at 0.2\u20131 frames/min. Suilysin prepores and pores were also imaged at rates of up to 10 frames/min using a home-built AFM system and miniaturized cantilevers (<a href=\"#bib16\">Leung et al., 2012</a>), but this did not yield information additional to the data presented here. Suilysin prepores were only resolved at high concentration on the membrane (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), or when the temperature was lowered to 15\u00b0C (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The real-time, low-temperature measurements were carried out on a Dimension FastScan AFM system in tapping mode with images acquired at 4 frames/min using FastScan Dx probes (Bruker).The AFM probes used for suilysin imaging had nominal spring constants ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 N/m and resonance frequencies between 10 and 130 kHz in liquid. We used silicon nitride AFM probes with batch-processed silicon tips including MSNL E and F (Bruker), ScanAsyst Fluid+ (Bruker), and cantilevers with individually grown carbon tips, for example, Biotool (Nanotools, Munich, Germany).

They used AFM and cryo-EM to investigate both, the structure and dynamics of pore formation. Interpretation of these data was done by fitting and modeling. The crystal structure of suilysin reveals key-shaped molecule in its soluble form, which undergoes a conformational change when binding to the target membrane. Cryo- and negative stain EM of cys-locked suilysin-prepores and wt-pores revealed rings of different diameters but identical number (37) of subunits, supporting the conformational change. A 3D map was reconstructed from cryo-EM projections of vitrified rings."

While we cannot exclude the ejection of some protein, our interpretation of ejected lipids is supported (i) by the subsequent appearance of collapsed lipid vesicles on the membrane (plateaus in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), and (ii) by the fact that after completion of pore formation, there are obviously lipids missing within the pore lumens (see holes in membrane, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), as described in the manuscript."
