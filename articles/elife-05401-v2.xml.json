It was first identified as a neurotrophic factor and later as the most potent natural antiangiogenic factor, a stem cell niche factor, and an inhibitor of cancer cell growth. Numerous animal models demonstrated its therapeutic value in treating blinding diseases and diverse cancer types. A long-standing challenge is to reveal how PEDF acts on its target cells and the identities of the cell-surface receptors responsible for its activities. Here we report the identification of transmembrane proteins PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 as cell-surface receptors for PEDF. Using distinct cellular models, we demonstrate their cell type-specific receptor activities through loss of function and gain of function studies. Our experiments suggest that PEDF receptors form homooligomers under basal conditions, and PEDF dissociates the homooligomer to activate the receptors. Mutations in the intracellular domain can have profound effects on receptor activities."

It was first identified as a neurotrophic factor and later as the most potent natural antiangiogenic factor, a stem cell niche factor, and an inhibitor of cancer cell growth. Numerous animal models demonstrated its therapeutic value in treating blinding diseases and diverse cancer types. A long-standing challenge is to reveal how PEDF acts on its target cells and the identities of the cell-surface receptors responsible for its activities. Here we report the identification of transmembrane proteins PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 as cell-surface receptors for PEDF. Using distinct cellular models, we demonstrate their cell type-specific receptor activities through loss of function and gain of function studies. Our experiments suggest that PEDF receptors form homooligomers under basal conditions, and PEDF dissociates the homooligomer to activate the receptors. Mutations in the intracellular domain can have profound effects on receptor activities."

There exists a natural factor that can inhibit pathogenesis of several major diseases and has surprisingly diverse therapeutic value. This factor is called Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dawson et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tombran-Tink and Barnstable, 2003</a>) and was originally identified as a strong protective factor for neurons (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tombran-Tink and Barnstable, 2003</a>). It was also initially known as EPC-1, a factor that is downregulated by more than 100-fold in aged compared to young human fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pignolo et al., 1993</a>). In an unbiased search for new antiangiogenic factors, PEDF was identified as the most potent endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dawson et al., 1999</a>). PEDF inhibits endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis even in the presence of strong proangiogenic factors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dawson et al., 1999</a>). It specifically targets new vessel growth without affecting pre-existing vessels. In numerous animal models, PEDF has been shown to have potent therapeutic effects in treating several major human diseases through its neurotrophic, anti-angiogenic, antitumorigenic and antimetastatic activities. In addition to treating major blinding diseases such as ischemia-induced retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (<a href=\"#bib53\">Stellmach et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Semkova et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Miyazaki et al., 2011</a>), PEDF has been shown to inhibit the growth of a wide variety of cancer types including melanoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, hepatoblastoma, Lewis lung carcinoma, chondrosarcoma, gastric carcinoma, glioma, Wilm's tumor, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer (<a href=\"#bib12\">Doll et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ek et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fernandez-Garcia et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Broadhead et al., 2009</a>).

A significant decrease in PEDF level in the eyes has been observed in patients with age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, two major blinding diseases characterized by neovascularization (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ogata et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Spranger et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Holekamp et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ogata et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Boehm et al., 2003</a>).

Uncovering the transmembrane pathways of PEDF would lead to a better understanding of its fundamental mechanisms and the development of new therapeutic strategies. After many years of effort in trying both existing and new strategies on a variety of native tissues and cell types, we were unable to identify the PEDF receptor, likely due to its low abundance and transient nature of expression. Since PEDF's actions do not match any well-characterized receptors, we reasoned that its receptor is likely new and uncharacterized. We tested human orphan receptors and transmembrane domain proteins of unknown function for their ability to bind native PEDF on the cell surface and found two transmembrane domain proteins that confer cell-surface PEDF binding and have other properties expected of PEDF receptors. These two membrane proteins both have a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain, and share about 50% homology. These two membrane proteins are called plexin domain containing 1 (PLXDC1) and plexin domain containing 2 (PLXDC2). Gene and protein expression studies have revealed overlapping but distinct tissue expression patterns of PLXDC1 (<a href=\"#bib50\">St Croix et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gaultier et al., 2010</a>) and PLXDC2 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Leighton et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">McMurray et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Miller-Delaney et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boheler et al., 2014</a>)."

                                "text": "Studying PEDF receptors requires robust and accessible cellular assays for gain and loss of function studies. We used three cell types that respond robustly and reproducibly to PEDF as cellular models to study PEDF receptors: macrophage cell RAW267.4, endothelial cell SVEC4-10, and neuronal cell 661W. These three cell types represent three distinct cellular targets of PEDF. We found that both PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 are expressed in these three cellular models, consistent with previous knowledge that both RAW267.4 and SVEC4-10 cells express PLXDC1 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gaultier et al., 2010</a>). In macrophage RAW267.4, PEDF is known to stimulate secretion of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zamiri et al., 2006</a>). To perform loss of function studies, we screened for siRNAs that can effectively knockdown PLXDC1 or PLXDC2 expression in RAW26.4 cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The most effective siRNA was used in subsequent functional assays. We found that knocking down of either PLXDC1 or PLXDC2 led to a substantial decrease in PEDF response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Conversely, transfection of either receptor into macrophages further augments PEDF-induced secretion of IL-10 without increasing basal activity (basal activity is defined as receptor activity without PEDF treatment) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Either receptor lacking the cytoplasmic domain no longer has this activity, consistent with role of the cytoplasmic domain in cellular signaling (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Tyrosine 481 in human PLXDC1 is a highly conserved residue in the cytoplasmic domain and is a potential phosphorylation site. PLXDC1 with a mutation of this single residue in the cytoplasmic domain (Y481F) has highly enhanced PEDF-mediated response without increasing the basal activity of the receptor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). One potential mechanism is that phosphorylation of this residue dampens receptor signaling and the mutation prevents this inhibition. PLXDC1 transfected cell shows about 100% increased activity in response to 2 nM PEDF as compared to control cells, while PLXDC1-Y481F cells showed about 400% increased activity in response to PEDF (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This profound stimulatory effect on PEDF signaling by mutating a single intracellular conserved residue in PLXDC1 supports its role in PEDF signaling."

Since the cytoplasmic domain of each receptor is expected to be involved in downstream signaling, we tested the effect of expression of the cytoplasmic domain fused to the transmembrane domain of another membrane protein (DCC) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Stein and Tessier-Lavigne, 2001</a>) without the extracellular domain of each receptor. Interestingly, transfection of PLXDC2 cytoplasmic domain linked to the DCC transmembrane domain is sufficient to cause cell death independently of PEDF. In contrast, the cytoplasmic domain of PLXDC1 does not have this activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We also found that mutations in two cytoplasmic residues that are potential phosphorylation sites in the PLXDC2 tail enhance the effect of PLXDC2 in causing cell death (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These experiments demonstrated that PLXDC2 is responsible for mediating PEDF-mediated cell death in this cell type, while there is no detectable role of PLXDC1. In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of the PLXDC2 is sufficient to trigger downstream activity."

We found that PEDF treatment effectively protects 661W cells against oxidative damage. Knocking down PLXDC1, but not PLXDC2, in 661W cells abolishes the protective effect of PEDF (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Conversely, using gain of function analysis, we showed that transfection of PLXDC1 further enhances the protective effect of PEDF and that transfection of the cytoplasmic domain of PLXDC1 protects 661W independent of PEDF (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These experiments suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor is responsible for triggering the intracellular events during receptor activation.

What is the consequence of PEDF's binding to these receptors? To answer this question, we performed further mechanistic studies on PEDF/receptor interaction. We hypothesized that PEDF might affect the oligomerization states of the receptors. We found that PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 form homooligomers in the absence of PEDF. We designed experiments to compare homooligomerization and heterooligomerization and found that PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 preferentially form homooligomers (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Using deletion series of the extracellular domains, we identified domain D as an important domain for oligomerization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We noticed that the last residue in the cytoplasmic domain of both PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 is a conserved cysteine. Since intracellular cysteines are in the reduced state, we tested whether copper phenanthroline-induced thiol oxidation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>) could crosslink these cysteines. Indeed, we found that copper phenanthroline promoted the formation of covalent dimers, consistent with the close proximity of the two cysteines on the cytoplasmic domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This covalent dimer can be cleaved under reducing conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), consistent with its linkage through a disulfide bond catalyzed by copper phenanthroline. Interestingly, incubation with PEDF before copper phenanthroline treatment inhibited the formation of the dimer and promoted the formation of the monomer, indicating that the cytoplasmic tail is no longer in close contact with another cytoplasmic tail (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

This effect of PEDF is consistent with the ability of membrane-tethered cytoplasmic tail to activate downstream pathways."

PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 represent a receptor family of their own that has two members in human. Through both loss of function and gain of function studies using three distinct cellular models that respond robustly to PEDF, we showed that both receptors have the expected properties of PEDF receptors in transducing PEDF signal and have cell type-specific roles. How does PEDF activate its cell-surface receptors? Our experiments suggest that these receptors form homodimers under basal conditions, and the dimerization functions to inhibit self-activation. PEDF activates its receptors through dissociation of the dimer. PEDF's ability to dissociate the receptor dimer was demonstrated using three independent techniques. Without oligomerization provided by the extracellular domains, the cytoplasmic domain of the PEDF receptor is sufficient to activate downstream signaling. We also showed that modulating the cytoplasmic domain strongly affects receptor signaling. For example, a mutation in a conserved tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of PLXDC1 greatly enhanced PEDF-induced and PLXDC1-dependent IL-10 secretion from macrophages. Structure and function analysis revealed an important PEDF-interacting domain and a dimerization domain in the receptors."

PLXDC1 (also called tumor endothelial marker 7) was discovered as one of the genes enriched in many types of human tumor endothelial cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">St Croix et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schwarze et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Beaty et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">van Beijnum et al., 2009</a>). PLXDC1 was also found to be highly expressed in the endothelial cells of another human disease- diabetic retinopathy- and is highly specific to diseased blood vessels (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yamaji et al., 2008</a>). PLXDC1 is also expressed on the macrophage cell surface (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gaultier et al., 2010</a>) and is downregulated by LRP-1, a large membrane protein involved in endocytosis of a variety of cell surface receptors (<a href=\"#bib23\">Herz et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Herz and Strickland, 2001</a>). In contrast, PLXDC2, but not PLXDC1, was found as one of the genes that increase in expression during cellular senescence (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schwarze et al., 2005</a>), as one of the E2F1 target genes repressed by serum (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hallstrom et al., 2008</a>), as a gene negatively correlated with malignant cell transformation in tumors and its disturbance increases tumor volume (<a href=\"#bib32\">McMurray et al., 2008</a>), and as a candidate axon guidance molecule (<a href=\"#bib28\">Leighton et al., 2001</a>). Microarray analysis also revealed PLXDC2, but not PLXDC1, as one of the markers of adult stem cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Noh, 2006</a>). Proteomic analysis also revealed PLXDC2 on the cell surface of human pluripotent stem cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boheler et al., 2014</a>). PLXDC2 is also known as a mitogen for neuroprogenitors (<a href=\"#bib33\">Miller-Delaney et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, expression patterns of both PEDF and PLXDC2 have been previously linked to cellular growth states. PEDF expression correlates with G0 growth arrest in fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pignolo et al., 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2003</a>) and has been demonstrated to induce cell cycle arrest of glioma cells (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>). The correlation between PLXDC2 and cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Miller-Delaney et al., 2011</a>), senescence (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schwarze et al., 2005</a>), transformation (<a href=\"#bib32\">McMurray et al., 2008</a>) and cell death (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hallstrom et al., 2008</a>) has been noted in several studies. Consistent with these earlier reports, our study identified PLXDC2 as playing the dominant role in a PEDF-induced endothelial cell death model."

These receptors represent a new type of cell-surface receptor. They oligomerize in the basal state and are activated by ligand-induced dissociation. Mechanistically, they behave oppositely from many known single transmembrane domain signaling receptors that are activated by ligand-induced dimerization. However, detailed mechanisms can be complex, as exemplified by the human grown hormone receptor. For a long time after its original discovery more than two decades ago (<a href=\"#bib29\">Leung et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cunningham and Wells, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cunningham et al., 1989</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">1991a</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">1991b</a>), the growth hormone receptor was hypothesized to be activated by ligand-induced receptor dimerization, as revealed by classic studies.

As shown by G-protein coupled receptors, distinct cellular responses can be governed not only by distinct cell-surface receptors, but also by distinct downstream molecules. Because PEDF is a multifunctional factor, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of its transmembrane receptors in different cellular contexts will help to develop potent and specific small molecule-based therapeutics in treating diseases."

Six hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and changed to serum free medium (SFM). PEDF is naturally present in several isoforms as revealed by isoelectric focusing (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tombran-Tink et al., 1995</a>). Not all PEDF isoforms are equally active (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duh et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Subramanian et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duh et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Subramanian et al., 2012</a>), we found that more negatively charged PEDF isoforms are more biologically active. Therefore, we purified PEDF using sequential anion exchange chromatography. Briefly, PEDF was purified from conditioned SFM 24, 48, or 72 hours after transfection using a combination of Q sepharose (Amersham/GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) and polyethyleneimine column (AX-300, Eprogen, Downers Grove, IL). The conditioned SFM was dialyzed against binding buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5 and 50 mM NaCl) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Dialyzed medium was then applied to Q sepharose equilibrated with the binding buffer. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of binding buffer before elution using buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5 with 100, 200, 300, or 400 mM NaCl. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using polyethyleneimine column was performed to further purify PEDF. Briefly, buffer exchange for the Q fraction containing PEDF was performed for three times by diluting with 10 vol of column buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 8.4) and concentrating in an Amicon Ultra-4 filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) before being loaded onto the HPLC system. HPLC was performed using the Agilent 1100 series liquid chromatography system with a diode-array detector. Proteins were separated on polyethyleneimine column using column buffer with increasing NaCl concentrations as the mobile phase (from 0 to 1.8 M in 8 min and the 1.8 M sodium concentration was maintained for another 4 min). The flow speed of mobile phase was 0.5 ml/min, and four fractions were collected every minute. Elution fractions with significant A280 value were saved. Buffer exchange was performed for three times by diluting with 10 vol of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and concentrating in an Amicon Ultra spin filter. The final volume of each concentrated elution was 0.5 ml. The presence of PEDF was confirmed by both total gel staining and Western blot analysis. Protein sterilization was achieved using Ultrafree Durapore 0.22 \u03bcm filter (Millipore). We also produced PEDF with a 6XHis tag followed by the HA tag at the N-terminus after the secretion signal and PEDF with an 8XHis tag at the C-terminus of PEDF. We found that tagging significantly diminishes the biological activity of PEDF. Therefore, all biological assays were performed using untagged PEDF. The negative effect of epitope tagging on PEDF is likely one of the reasons that PEDF receptors are difficult to identify."

After biotinylation, free biotin was removed by further overnight dialysis in PBS at 4\u00b0C and the degree of biotinylation was assessed by visualizing the shifting of molecular weight in SDS-PAGE gels after incubation with streptavidin. The advantage of biotinylation is that biotin is a tag much smaller than peptide tags or fusion protein tags and is less likely to interfere with biological activities. In addition, biotin is added after protein production and folding and allows sensitive detection. However, excessive biotinylation can inactivate proteins due to the modification of key lysine residues. To prevent excessive biotinylation, the ideal degree of biotinylation is about 90%, as judged by shifting in molecular weight after binding to streptavidin. Biotinylated PEDF (20 nM) was added to transfected or control cells grown on a fibronectin-coated dish in HBSS with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 2 mg/ml BSA at room temperature for 1 hour.

For DNA transfection, the cells were split at 1:6 ratio 16 hours before transfection and were transfected using Jetprime reagent. Eight hours after transfection, the media was changed to fresh media and PEDF was added. PEDF-induced IL-10 secretion from macrophages was assayed using mouse IL-10 ELISA kit from Southern Biotech 18 hours after PEDF addition. For siRNA transfection, media was changed to fresh media and PEDF was added after two rounds of 48-hour transfection. All final assays were performed in 96-well plates in triplicate. We found that longer culture of RAW267.4 cells without cell replating leads to more responsiveness to PEDF. Since siRNA experiments need longer cell culture time, cells are consistently more responsive to PEDF than cells in DNA transfection experiments, which are done only 1 day after transfection."

Since the three cell types (RAW267.4, SVEC4-10 and 661W) that were used as cellular models to study PEDF receptors are all mouse cells, siRNAs targeting mouse genes were tested. For mouse PLXDC1, siRNAs tested included Dharmacon D-060224-01 (siRNA-1), Dharmacon D-060224-02 (siRNA-2), Dharmacon D-060224-03 (siRNA-3), Dharmacon D-060224-04 (siRNA-4), Invitrogen 4390771-s90877 (siRNA-5), Invitrogen 4390771-s90878 (siRNA-6), Dharmacon smart pool L-060224-01 (siRNA-7) and Origene 866091-SR46066C (siRNA-8).

For mouse LRP-1, siRNAs tested included Origene SR423695A-866095 (siRNA-1) and SR423695B-866096 (siRNA-2). Control siRNA was from Invitrogen. The most effective siRNA was transfected through reverse transfection using RNAiMAX in antibiotic free culture medium at 50 nM concentration with a cell splitting ratio of 1:5. To achieve a high transfection rate and knockdown effect, reverse transfection was performed twice consecutively following the manufacturer's protocol. At 48 hr after transfection, the cells were reverse transfected again using the same siRNA for the second round of knockdown. Functional assays were performed 48 hours after the second round of reverse transfection."

Cell lysate was spun at 16,000\u00d7<i>g</i>, 4\u00b0C for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. Cell lysate was applied to anti-Rim antibody conjugated beads, and rotated for 4 hr at 4\u00b0C.

Tris (pH 9.5) was added to 0.1 M to neutralize the elution before the samples were analyzed. HA-tagged proteins were detected using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody. To compare homooligomerization and heteroligomerization, anti-Rim purification was performed 24 hr after cells were transfected with Rim-tagged PLXDC1 (20%), HA-tagged PLXDC1 (40%) and untagged PLXDC2 (40%) in one experiment and Rim-tagged PLXDC2 (20%), HA-tagged PLXDC2 (40%) and untagged PLXDC1 (40%) in another experiment. Copurified receptors were detected either by anti-HA antibody or antibody specific to PLXDC1 or PLXDC2. Polyclonal antibodies against the N-terminal peptide of human PLXDC1 (SPQPGAGHDEGPGSGWAAKGTVRG) and the N-terminal peptide of human PLXDC2 (KPGDQILDWQYGVTQAFPHTE) were produced by conjugating the peptides to KLH before immunization of rabbits (Genemed Synthesis, San Antonio, TX). Antibodies were purified from rabbit crude sera using the corresponding peptide conjugated to Affigel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)."

Three glycine linkers were added between YFP/CFP and the C-terminal tail of PLXDC1 or PLXDC2. FRET analysis was performed similarly as described (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kawaguchi et al., 2011</a>). Briefly, membranes were prepared from HEK293 cells that coexpress PLXDC1-CFP and PLXDC2-YFP. CFP-YFP FRET was measured in black flat bottom 96-well plates (Microfluor 2, Thermo Scientific) using simultaneous dual emission optics in POLARstar Omega with excitation filter 422-20 and emission filters 470-12 and 530-10. The background signal of each reaction was measured before PEDF was added to the membrane suspension to initiate the reactions. The signal from each time point was the average of 20 measurements. After all the measurements were done, the signals were calculated as the ratio of emissions at 530 nm over emissions at 470 nm to observe the dynamic change in FRET. To crosslink the C-terminal free cysteine using BMOE (Pierce), membrane preparations were made in PBS and 5 mM EDTA. BMOE was added to the membrane suspension at a concentration of 2 mM. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 1 hour. Concentrated DTT solution was added to 5 mM to quench the reaction. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, 1 ml of HBSS/HEPES (HBSS with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) was added to the membrane suspension. After the membranes were pelleted down, the resulting membrane pellets were washed once and resuspended in HBSS/HEPES for FRET measurement."

The authors provide evidence for a novel mechanism of action whereby the two receptors (PLXDC1 and PLXDC2) are present in an inactive heterodimer in the basal state. PEDF binds to either PLXDC1 or PLXDC2, which causes the heterodimer to dissociate, thereby allowing each of the receptors to transmit regulatory signals."

However, whether these receptors preferentially form homooligomer or heterooligomer is an interesting question. We have performed a new experiment to answer this question and found that both PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 prefer to form homooligomers (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). This result is consistent with the homooligomer model we proposed in the original manuscript. We agree with Reviewer 1\u2019s comment that a model that depends on heterooligomer formation is problematic due to the requirement of strict stoichiometry in the expression of both receptors in all cell types."

However, due to the extremely large size of LRP-1, detailed mapping of its interaction with PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 is a separate topic that demands systematic work in the future. siRNA-2 for LRP-1 in the Figure reproducibly knocked down LRP-1 expression by more than 80%. We also tried PEA-10 cells (Lrp-1 +/-) and PEA-13 cells (Lrp-1 -/-), but encountered the difficulty that currently no PEDF-related assay has been established in these cellular models."
