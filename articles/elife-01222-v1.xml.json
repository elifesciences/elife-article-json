Predominant sources of spontaneous DSBs remain elusive. We report synthetic technology for quantifying DSBs using fluorescent-protein fusions of double-strand DNA end-binding protein, Gam of bacteriophage Mu. In <i>Escherichia coli</i> GamGFP forms foci at chromosomal DSBs and pinpoints their subgenomic locations. Spontaneous DSBs occur mostly one per cell, and correspond with generations, supporting replicative models for spontaneous breakage, and providing the first true breakage rates. In mammalian cells GamGFP\u2014labels laser-induced DSBs antagonized by end-binding protein Ku; co-localizes incompletely with DSB marker 53BP1 suggesting superior DSB-specificity; blocks resection; and demonstrates DNA breakage via APOBEC3A cytosine deaminase. We demonstrate directly that some spontaneous DSBs occur outside of S phase. The data illuminate spontaneous DNA breakage in <i>E. coli</i> and human cells and illustrate the versatility of fluorescent-Gam for interrogation of DSBs in living cells."

Predominant sources of spontaneous DSBs remain elusive. We report synthetic technology for quantifying DSBs using fluorescent-protein fusions of double-strand DNA end-binding protein, Gam of bacteriophage Mu. In <i>Escherichia coli</i> GamGFP forms foci at chromosomal DSBs and pinpoints their subgenomic locations. Spontaneous DSBs occur mostly one per cell, and correspond with generations, supporting replicative models for spontaneous breakage, and providing the first true breakage rates. In mammalian cells GamGFP\u2014labels laser-induced DSBs antagonized by end-binding protein Ku; co-localizes incompletely with DSB marker 53BP1 suggesting superior DSB-specificity; blocks resection; and demonstrates DNA breakage via APOBEC3A cytosine deaminase. We demonstrate directly that some spontaneous DSBs occur outside of S phase. The data illuminate spontaneous DNA breakage in <i>E. coli</i> and human cells and illustrate the versatility of fluorescent-Gam for interrogation of DSBs in living cells."

The method involved combining a natural virus protein called Gam with a fluorescent protein called GFP (short for green fluorescent protein) to make a fusion protein called GamGFP. Gam was chosen because it binds only to double-strand breaks, traps double-strand breaks, and does not bind to any proteins. Genetic engineering techniques were used to introduce GamGFP into cells, with DNA breaks in these cells showing up as fluorescent spots when viewed under a microscope."

In particular, Shee et al. found evidence for a mechanism of DNA breakage that appears to be specific to primates. This mechanism involves an enzyme that is only found in the innate immune system of primates removing an amine group from a cytosine. In future, this approach might allow the trapping, mapping and quantification of DNA breaks in all kinds of cells, and the highly specific way GamGFP binds to breaks could make it the preferred tool for studying DNA breakage in mammalian cells."

We use \u2018DSE\u2019 to refer to each single DSE in a two-ended DSB and to the sole DSE in a one-ended DSB. DSBs (one- and two-ended) promote deletions, genome rearrangements (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hastings et al., 2009</a>), chromosome loss (<a href=\"#bib69\">Paques and Haber, 1999</a>), and point mutations (<a href=\"#bib37\">Harris et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Rosenberg et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Strathern et al., 1995</a>). DSB-induced genomic instability promotes cancer (<a href=\"#bib63\">Negrini et al., 2010</a>) and genetic diseases (<a href=\"#bib66\">O\u2019Driscoll and Jeggo, 2006</a>), evolution of antibiotic resistance (<a href=\"#bib20\">Cirz et al., 2005</a>) and of pathogenic bacteria (<a href=\"#bib74\">Prieto et al., 2006</a>) including in biofilms (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boles and Singh, 2008</a>). The latter reflect the role of DSBs in inducing mutagenesis and genome rearrangement under stress, which may accelerate evolution of bacteria (<a href=\"#bib4\">Al Mamun et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Rosenberg et al., 2012</a>), and human cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bindra et al., 2007</a>). DSBs are implicated in mutation hotspots in cancer genomes (<a href=\"#bib64\">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Roberts et al., 2012</a>). Breaks induced by ionizing radiation and alkylating drugs are used as anti-cancer therapy, and conversely DSBs are likely to foretell genomic instability that drives malignancy (<a href=\"#bib63\">Negrini et al., 2010</a>). Despite the importance of DSBs to many biological processes, quantification of DSBs has been limited. Moreover, although some mechanisms of DSB formation are being explicated (<a href=\"#bib59\">Merrikh et al., 2012</a>), the main mechanisms underlying spontaneous DNA breakage in bacterial (<a href=\"#bib71\">Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007</a>) and human cells (<a href=\"#bib96\">Vilenchik and Knudson, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kongruttanachok et al., 2010</a>) remain elusive."

The standard single-cell gel electrophoresis (\u2018comet\u2019) assay (<a href=\"#bib67\">Olive et al., 1990</a>) detects single-strand (ss) DNA nicks and DSBs, and thus is not specific to DSBs, whereas the neutral comet assay (<a href=\"#bib101\">Wojewodzka et al., 2002</a>) is DSB-specific, but lacks sensitivity.

Antibodies to \u03b3-H2AX and 53BP1 detect a modified histone and a DNA repair protein respectively, rather than DNA ends, and are likely to label sites not currently possessing a DSB. \u03b3-H2AX is a histone variant phosphorylated at sites of DNA damage during DNA damage signaling. \u03b3-H2AX spreads over up to \u223c2-Mbp regions that comprise 500 to 8000 \u03b3-H2AX molecules, so does not pinpoint DSB sites (<a href=\"#bib80\">Rogakou et al., 1999</a>). Numbers of \u03b3-H2AX foci induced by DNA damage may not represent true numbers of DSBs (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bouquet et al., 2006</a>), and \u03b3-H2AX focus formation is variable and can occur at non-DSB sites (<a href=\"#bib35\">Han et al., 2006</a>). Thus, \u03b3-H2AX may not always signify a physical break. 53BP1 is a non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) protein and forms nuclear foci upon ionizing radiation (IR) treatment, dependently on several histone modifications including \u03b3-H2AX, H2A/X ubiquitylation and H4K20 methylation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lukas et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2013</a>). Because these histone modifications do not exist equally throughout the genome, the efficiency and DSB-specificity of 53BP1 are not known. Moreover, \u03b3-H2AX, and all histological markers provide \u2018snapshots\u2019 of fixed cells and do not allow the possibility of measuring accrual of DSBs over time. Although Ku is likely to be most specific for DSBs via its function in NHEJ (<a href=\"#bib91\">Taccioli et al., 1994</a>), Ku also functions at telomeres (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gravel et al., 1998</a>) and appears to interact with RNA polymerase II (<a href=\"#bib25\">Dynan and Yoo, 1998</a>), raising questions about its specificity. Ku also binds ssDNA nicks, gaps, and regions of transition between single- and double-stranded structures, supporting concerns about its specificity (<a href=\"#bib68\">Paillard and Strauss, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Blier et al., 1993</a>)."

In stationary-phase (non-replicating) cells, RNA/DNA hybrids left by transcription (R-loops) promote DNA breakage apparently by priming replication forks that then collapse at ssDNA nicks (<a href=\"#bib100\">Wimberly et al., 2013</a>). Though replication can generate DSBs, whether it is the principle generator of DSBs spontaneously, in cells/sites not specifically engineered to maximize collisions, has not been addressed. Similarly, spontaneous 53BP1 foci can be detected in G1 (non-replicating) human cells (<a href=\"#bib54\">Lukas et al., 2011a</a>).

In human, uracils in DNA can be processed by UNG2 into abasic sites and subsequently into ssDNA nicks by APEX. Such nicks could potentially produce DSBs via opposing strand nicks or replication-fork collapses, as occurs with uracil excision from DNA in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kuzminova and Kuzminov, 2008</a>). Although DSBs have been inferred and associated with AID for Ig translocations in some B-cell cancers (<a href=\"#bib78\">Robbiani and Nussenzweig, 2013</a>), DSBs have yet to be identified directly.

First, when GamGFP is produced for 3 hr in cells without I-<i>Sce</i>I endonuclease, spontaneous foci (presumably reflecting spontaneous DSBs, validated below) are visible in \u223c7.5% of cells, a number higher than the 2.1% of cells with DSBs reported in a previous assay (<a href=\"#bib71\">Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007</a>). This discrepancy, we show below, reflects different growth medium (which affects growth rate and the number of chromosomes per cell) from that of the previous assay. Second, GamGFP forms foci in almost all cells when I-<i>Sce</i>I is induced in cells carrying an I-<i>Sce</i>I cutsite (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>), and not in cells expressing only the enzyme (no cutsite, not shown), or carrying the cutsite but no enzyme (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, \u201cspontaneous\u201d). These data imply that DSBs underlie foci. Third, we varied the number of DSBs per cell by using rapidly growing cells with the I-site either near the replication origin (<i>ori</i>) (more DNA copies, so more DSBs upon I<i>-Sce</i>I induction) or near the replication terminus (fewer DNA/I-site copies, so fewer DSBs, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). qPCR showed \u223c2\u20133 times more <i>ori-</i> than <i>ter-</i>proximal DNA copies under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Whereas the cells with an <i>ori-</i>proximal I-site had 57 \u00b1 2% of cells with &gt;1 focus, those with the <i>ter</i>-proximal I-site had a significantly lower 14 \u00b1 3% of cells with &gt;1 focus (p<i>=</i>0.0001, Student\u2019s <i>t</i> test).

In cells carrying this chromosomal-site label, we introduced an I-<i>Sce</i>I cutsite (I-site) either 10 kb, 55 kb, 80 kb or 2.4 Mb away in different strains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D,F,H</a>) and quantified co-localization of GamGFP and TetR-mCherry (representative data, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,E,G,I</a>). We find that GamGFP foci co-localize with the TetR-mCherry focus, producing a yellow focus, about 80% of the time with the I-site 10 kb from the array (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,J</a>). The remaining 20% of cells had average interfocal distances of \u223c0.3 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). With 55 kb, 80 kb, and 2 Mb separating the I-site and <i>tetO</i> array, the mean distances between green and red foci increased to 0.45 \u03bcm, 0.52 \u03bcm, and to 0.57 \u03bcm respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>) and the number of cells with overlapping (yellow) foci decreased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). With the most distant I-site, most cells had one green (<i>ter</i>-proximal) focus and two red (<i>ori</i>-proximal) foci with the average distance \u223c0.84 \u03bcm (2.4 Mb far, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>) and 0.57 \u03bcm (2.4 Mb near, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>) between the single green focus and each of the two red foci. The percentages of co-localization were significantly different for 10, 55 and 80 kb (p=0.00003, 0.00001, and 0.00006, Student\u2019s <i>t</i> test) and not between 80 kb and 2.4 Mb (p=0.053). These data imply that sites farther than 80 kb apart are not necessarily further apart in space within the bacterial nucleoid (3-D chromosome structure), at least not after the nucleoid has suffered double-strand cleavage. Interfocal distances were more variable and less significantly different than the proportion of co-localization, probably reflecting the dynamic nature of the chromosome within the nucleoids of these living cells. Our data show that co-localization of GamGFP and TetR-mCherry foci occurs when the cutsite is near to and not when it is far from the array. These results indicate first, that GamGFP can diagnose subgenomic locations of DSBs. Second, the data imply that beyond 80 kb, genomic locations are roughly the same physical distance apart in cleaved bacterial nucleoids (shown previously for sites &gt;200 kb apart in uncleaved nucleoids [<a href=\"#bib97\">Wang and Sherratt, 2010</a>]). Third, the data support the conclusion (above) that GamGFP foci occur at DSB sites."

In microfluidic chambers, we captured images of growing microcolonies from the 1-cell to \u223c100-cell stage measuring divisions and appearance of spontaneous GamGFP foci while varying cell-division rates by withdrawal of glucose from the flowing medium (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). If spontaneous DSBs form independently of replication/generations, then the focus appearance might correlate with time not generations, whereas replication-dependent mechanisms of DSB formation predict correspondence with generations. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, cells that were kept dividing in log-phase for 9 hr, then shifted to no-glucose for an additional 18 hr, show severely slowed divisions after the shift, and a highly precise correspondence of the numbers of spontaneous DSB foci with numbers of cell divisions at all division rates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To verify that the cells experiencing slow/no growth were still capable of forming GamGFP foci had breaks been present, we gave 20 \u03bcg/ml of DSB-producing agent phleomycin after 27 hr and found that 45 \u00b1 5% (mean \u00b1 SEM) of cells then formed GamGFP foci (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, 32 hr).

GamGFP co-localized with 53BP1 visualized by immunofluorescence staining in the same laser-treated and fixed samples (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We observed less robust GamGFP localization at laser damage in living (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) than fixed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) HeLa cells, perhaps because pre-extraction of soluble GamGFP during fixation increases the apparent signal from the bound GamGFP (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We tested whether competition with Ku for DNA end-binding might be a factor affecting Gam localization to DSBs, as seen in yeast (<a href=\"#bib23\">d\u2019Adda di Fagagna et al., 2003</a>). We found \u223cthree-fold better labeling of laser-induced DSBs in Ku-deficient cells (lacking Ku80, also known as <i>Xrcc5</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup>; in which Ku70 is also downregulated, <a href=\"#bib91\">Taccioli et al., 1994</a>) compared with heterozygous Ku80-competent cells (<i>Xrcc5</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup>) or <i>Lig4</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> (end-joining-defective but Ku-competent) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Because GamGFP is inhibited by Ku even in end-joining-defective cells lacking LigIV (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we infer that competition with Ku reduces GamGFP recruitment to DSBs independently of NHEJ, not that end-joining reduces the numbers of DSBs present for GamGFP to bind.

This result is expected because, first, Gam is specific for flush DSEs with up to a four-base single-strand DNA overhang (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akroyd and Symonds, 1986</a>), not the long single-strand DNA overhangs created by resection of DSBs by repair exonucleases (<a href=\"#bib90\">Symington and Gautier, 2011</a>). Therefore, there are expected to be 53BP1 foci unoccupied by GamGFP, as we observe in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, because GamGFP is a more specific reagent. Second, 53BP1 is expected to have a post-DSB-repair presence because it binds modified nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lukas et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2013</a>) rather than DNA, which is also compatible with our data.

At least in <i>E. coli</i>, GamGFP focus formation is very rapid, with 91 \u00b1 0.5% (mean \u00b1 SEM, three independent experiments) of the foci resulting from a 10-min (pulse) exposure to 20 \u00b5g/ml phleomycin appearing at 10 min.

However, 53BP1 forms unusually large nuclear foci exclusively in a subset of undamaged G1 cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Harrigan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Lukas et al., 2011a</a>). The large foci in otherwise undamaged cells are only in G1, as shown by their CyclinA-negative state and tracking fluorescent 53BP1 throughout the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib36\">Harrigan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Lukas et al., 2011a</a>). Although this might suggest that some spontaneous DSBs might form outside of S phase, it has been argued that not all 53BP1 foci indicate DSBs because different types of DNA damage nucleate 53BP1 foci (<a href=\"#bib54\">Lukas et al., 2011a</a>). In this study, we examined the large nuclear 53BP1 foci in undamaged cells, previously shown to form exclusively in G1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Harrigan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Lukas et al., 2011a</a>), and find that \u223c60% of the 53BP1 foci in Ku80-deficient cells correspond to genuine GamGFP-detectable DSBs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Moreover, the GamGFP that coincides with 53BP1 foci contain multiple individual foci, implying that these DSBs may be in large multi-break clusters. Because GamGFP does not spread along DNA, it can resolve multiple nearby DSBs, which was not possible with 53BP1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Harrigan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Lukas et al., 2011a</a>). These data indicate that some spontaneous DSBs form outside of S phase, when most replication occurs, and do so in clusters."

GamGFP also allowed subcellular localization of site-specific DSBs relative to a chromosomal mCherry marker in <i>E. coli</i>, which are distinct even as close as 55 kb (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Similarly, GamGFP and GamEmGFP protein fusions produced in mammalian cells showed localization at laser-induced DSBs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), were inhibited by Ku in those cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>), and inhibited resection at DSBs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), indicating that GamGFPs label DSBs also in mammalian cells.

However, we note that a failure to detect DSBs using Gam may be due to competition with Ku (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>) and/or to relatively low levels of DNA damage. Additionally, in mammalian cells GamGFP foci were more dramatic in fixed than living cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), perhaps because depletion of background unbound GamGFP in the fixed cells improved contrast. Nevertheless, this tool can be extremely valuable for a number of studies. For instance, GamGFPs allowed us to validate indirect markers \u03b3-H2AX and 53BP1 as genuine DSB markers by showing co-localization at laser and IR-induced DSBs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5A,C,E\u2013G, 7, 8</a>), and GamGFP inhibits DNA end exonucleolytic resection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

One possible explanation is that, particularly in the Ku-defective MEFs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5G and 8</a>), GamGFPs may be more sensitive than 53BP1 to DSBs, and might make visible DSB foci <i>before</i> DNA-damage signaling has allowed sufficient 53BP1 accumulation to produce a visible focus. At least in <i>E. coli</i> GamGFP labels DSBs very rapidly, showing most foci by 10 min after phleomycin exposure. Thus, in some circumstances, GamGFPs may be more sensitive than 53BP1. Conversely, the presence of 53BP1 foci at sites that do not show GamGFP foci (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5E\u2013G, 7B,C</a>), even in Ku80-deficient MEFs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), may indicate that some of the sites bound by 53BP1 may not possess frank DSEs, the Gam DNA substrate (<a href=\"#bib99\">Williams and Radding, 1981</a>). This could be because either the DSB has been repaired, but the 53BP1 at the site has not yet dissipated, or because exonucleolytic ssDNA resection has created a long ssDNA overhang, which cannot be bound by Gam (<a href=\"#bib99\">Williams and Radding, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Akroyd and Symonds, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abraham and Symonds, 1990</a>).

A possible mechanism could be that removal of uracil from DNA after cytosine deamination followed by cleavage at the abasic site creates a ssDNA nick, which becomes a one-ended DSB either by replication-fork collapse (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), or similar ssDNA nick creation on the opposing strand. DNA breaks occur upon uracil excision from DNA in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kuzminova and Kuzminov, 2008</a>). Regardless of the specific mechanisms, the data indicate that cytosine-deamination may be a general mechanism of DSB generation in mammalian cells.

These true rates are 10\u201320-times lower than initial postulates (<a href=\"#bib22\">Cox et al., 2000</a>), but in line with each other. Because genomic rearrangement frequencies remain the same regardless of estimations of DSB numbers, these rarer and more accurate break rates imply that each DSB is 10\u201320 times more genome destabilizing than had initially been postulated.

For the next 9 hr, cells were bathed with M9 B1 glucose doxycylcine medium to allow division, then switched at 9 hr to the same medium without glucose, and bathed for an additional 18 hr. The number of cell divisions and the appearance of GamGFP foci were recorded using time-lapse microscopic photography throughout the experiment. After 27 hr, cells were treated with 20 \u03bcg/ml phleomycin to induce DSBs, to determine whether GamGFP foci could still form in the starved cells. We observed that 45 \u00b1 5% of the non-dividing cells produced GamGFP at that time, confirming that the failure to see GamGFP foci in the cells starved prior to that time reflects lack of spontaneous DSBs, not inability of foci to form if their had been DSBs. The data presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> show the means \u00b1 SEM of results from six individual cells that grew into microcolonies in the microfluidic chamber."

Moreover, we show experimentally that the repeated low-dose exposures of the developing microcolonies did not cause an increase in GamGFP foci by scoring control experiments in which a set of six developing microcolonies were not exposed to the first 9 pulses of fluorescent light, during the initial 27 hr of growth, then were photographed for the first time at 27 hr, which corresponds the to tenth light pulse in experimental samples scored in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. These previously unexposed samples showed 0.018 \u00b1 0.005 foci per cell at 27 hr, a number that is not significantly different (p<i>=</i>0.611, student\u2019s <i>t</i> test) from the repeatedly pulsed experimental samples at 27 hr, which showed 0.016 \u00b1 0.002 foci per cell at 9 hr. These data demonstrate that the spontaneous DNA breaks measured in the microfludics experiments were not significantly augmented with DNA breaks induced by repeated fluorescence imaging, and rather reflect genuine spontaneous DSBs."

DNA damage was created using a 405 nm solid-state laser focused through a 63X objective lens in the epifluorescence path of the microscope system on a Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan). Laser settings (60% laser power, 150 scans at 20 ms/pixel) were used that generated DNA damage specifically along the laser path in a BrdU-dependent manner. The cells were analyzed in TimeScan mode using Zero-drift compensation for auto focusing at an interval of 1\u20132 min for up to 30 min post-laser damage for live analysis.

Hoechst dye (0.1%) was added to this incubation step to stain nuclear DNA, followed by washing three times in PBS and mounting on coverslips containing Vectashield. The cells were imaged using an inverted Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan). To quantify laser recruitment of GamGFP, the cells were laser damaged and analyzed by immunofluorescence as described. Images from individual cells were taken and equal areas both in undamaged and damaged areas (as indicated by 53BP1 positive staining) were quantified for Gam signal using Fluoview software. The cells that showed a &gt;30% increase in intensity of GamGFP at the damage site compared with the undamaged site were labeled positive. This analysis was performed in both Ku80-proficient and Ku80-defective MEFs for &gt;50 cells and results are means \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments. For quantification of GamGFP IR foci, cells were damaged and analyzed by immunofluorescence as indicated. Individual images were taken and foci counted that either contained GamGFP only, 53BP1 only, or both. The average total number of foci per cell 30 min post-5Gy IR was 34. For &gt;2600 foci counted, the mean percentage of foci for each of the three categories is graphed for three independent experiments \u00b1 SEM."
