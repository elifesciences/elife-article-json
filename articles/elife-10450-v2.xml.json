The classic example of such integration is color vision, where input from different cone receptors is integrated to extract a specific feature of objects, approximately corresponding to their absorption spectrum (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gegenfurtner, 2003</a>). Signals are also combined across different sensory modalities, and this integration process is often optimized to extract stimulus information (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ernst and Banks, 2002</a>). Given that different sensory channels encode different stimulus features and exhibit different response properties, the central nervous system is faced with the challenge of how to integrate such disparate input signals."

However, the frequency sensitivities of the different afferent classes overlap considerably (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and natural stimuli typically engage more than one class (<a href=\"#bib35\">Saal and Bensmaia, 2014</a>). Not surprisingly, then, information about most tactile events is carried by signals from several afferent classes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Saal and Bensmaia, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Johansson and Flanagan, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</a>), and this input is integrated across submodalities even at the first stage of cortical processing, namely primary somatosensory cortex (S1)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">Pei et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Carter et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, S1 neurons convey information about contacted objects not only in the strength of their responses but also in their timing (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harvey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zuo et al., 2015</a>). For example, the amplitude of skin oscillations\u2014such as those elicited during the exploration of textured surfaces\u2014is encoded in the strength of the cortical response whereas their frequency is encoded in its timing. To achieve such multiplexing requires that afferent signals be integrated in a principled way."

We then implement a simple model that allows us to examine how responses of the different afferent populations combine to drive responses in cortex. First, we find that most S1 neurons integrate information from multiple afferent classes. Second, signals from the different classes drive cortical responses in very different ways: RA afferent input exerts an excitatory influence on S1 responses and is the primary determinant of their firing rates; in contrast, PC input exerts a balanced excitatory and inhibitory influence which sharpens the timing of cortical responses without having a major impact on the rates. Finally, we show that the process of integration maximizes information transmission across the range of stimulation conditions that might be encountered during everyday interactions with objects."

Stimulation conditions spanned those that might be experienced when we scan a textured surface (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bensma\u00efa and Hollins, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bensma\u00efa and Hollins, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Weber et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Manfredi et al., 2014</a>). As these stimuli drove RA and PC to the exclusion of SA1 afferents (<a href=\"#bib31\">Muniak et al., 2007</a>), we focused the analysis on these two afferent populations. The goal was to quantitatively predict S1 responses based on afferent responses. Because the stimuli used in the peripheral experiments were analogous but not identical to those used in the cortical experiments, we used simple but precise models of afferent responses (derived from recorded responses, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) to reconstruct RA and PC population responses to the stimuli used in the cortical experiments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). To examine how input from these different populations is integrated in cortex, we describe the transformation from the periphery to cortex as a linear filter over the RA and PC population responses whose output is subsequently rectified (based on the linear-nonlinear-Poisson framework (LNP), <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This approach allows us to examine the filters estimated for each cortical neuron to assess the contribution (if any) of each afferent population to that neuron\u2019s response and to characterize the dynamics of this integration. To the extent that this simple model captures different response properties of cortical neurons, the respective filters for these neurons will be different (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

Indeed, across neurons, the model captured 67% ( \u00b1 2% standard error of the mean) of the predictable variance (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ramirez et al., 2014</a>) for 1 s bins, and 35% ( \u00b1 2%) for 5 ms bins.

Similarly, the temporal patterning of responses in somatosensory cortex is precise and informative down to a millisecond timescale (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harvey et al., 2013</a>). RA and PC input are thus integrated in such a way to culminate in temporally patterned cortical responses. One might expect that the shorter integration window of the PC filters combined with their strong suppressive components would result in this sensory channel driving more precise spike timing than does its RA counterpart. Indeed, when removing the PC contribution from the model, predictions of spike timing in the cortex became less temporally precise (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We quantified this effect in two ways. First, we filtered the recorded and predicted time-varying firing rates to noise stimuli at different temporal resolutions and examined how much of the variance in the responses could be accounted for based on RA input or PC input alone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We found that only PC input can account for high frequency fluctuations in the cortical responses of many neurons, while RA input is sufficient at coarser temporal resolutions for almost all cortical neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In fact, the more precise the responses of a cortical neuron were, the more of its response variance was explained by PC input (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, we tested how well the model could account for the well-documented patterning in cortical responses to sinusoidal vibrations: over a wide range of frequencies, cortical neurons produce entrained responses to sinusoidal stimulation of the skin (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harvey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Salinas et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mountcastle et al., 1969</a>). That is, they produce one spike or burst of spikes within a very restricted phase of each stimulus cycle. We examined, then, whether we could predict the degree of entrainment of cortical neurons to sinusoidal stimuli from the RA and PC input. We found that the strength of phase-locking to sinusoids ranging in frequency from 50 to 300 Hz was well captured by the model (yielding a correlation between predicted and measured phase-locking of 0.78). Importantly, while RA input was dominant at the low frequencies, only the PC input could account for the observed phase-locking at 200 Hz and above (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

Second, RA and PC afferents drive S1 neurons in fundamentally different ways: RA input determines the rate of the response whereas the principal contribution of PC input is to sharpen the temporal precision of the response.

That is, the responses of S1 neurons cannot be explained from the responses of RA or PC neurons alone. While it has traditionally been assumed that the different tactile submodalities are segregated at least through primary somatosensory cortex (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sur et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sur et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Friedman et al., 2004</a>) (although cortical PC neurons have generally proven elusive, see below), recent evidence suggests that input from different classes of somatosensory afferents is indeed integrated between periphery and cortex (<a href=\"#bib35\">Saal and Bensmaia, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pei et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Carter et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Prescott et al., 2014</a>). In this study, stimuli fell in the range of frequencies that excites RA and PC fibers at the exclusion of SA1 fibers, which only respond to low-frequency stimulation. However, SA1 and RA input have been shown to be integrated in the responses of S1 neurons when these were studied with ramp-and-hold skin indentations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pei et al., 2009</a>) so the convergence of submodality-specific input onto individual S1 neurons seems to be a general phenomenon. However, it is still an open question whether the integration of input from different mechanoreceptors takes place only at the cortical level, or whether they appear already at the subcortical level in either the cuneate nucleus or the thalamus. Convergence of somatosensory submodalities has been observed in the brainstem of rats (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sakurai et al., 2013</a>) and the same is likely true in primates."

First, vibrotactile coding in general and the role of PC input specifically have been probed almost exclusively with high-frequency sinusoidal stimuli. These stimuli have been shown to evoke only a short transient response in S1, which then quickly decays back to baseline, a phenomenon that can be accounted for by the balance of excitation and suppression in the PC drive. That PC-elicited responses are short and weak might explain why PC-driven cortical neurons are thought to be extremely rare in S1 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lebedev and Nelson, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mountcastle et al., 1990</a>). Second, the main effect of PC input is to shape the timing of cortical spikes, which could account for the extremely precise timing of S1 responses at high frequencies (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harvey et al., 2013</a>) that has been shown to contribute to tactile perception (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zuo et al., 2015</a>). Third, the balanced drive of PC afferents explains why the firing rates of S1 neurons are not dependent on stimulus frequency even though PC rates are (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harvey et al., 2013</a>). Finally, the PC input has been found to inhibit cortical responses (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tommerdahl et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tommerdahl et al., 2010</a>), consistent with our finding that PC filters are often net suppressive."

Generally, it has been assumed that the peripheral input stems from a single homogeneous population of neurons (e.g. retinal ganglion cells). However, this is often not the case: in touch, information is carried by multiple separate populations of neurons, each with different sensitivities and response properties. To encode information efficiently, then, the disparate response properties of these different channels need to be taken into account. While both RA and PC afferents respond to most high-frequency skin vibrations, such as those elicited during texture scanning, both afferent classes do so in different ways. First, RA afferents increase their firing rate with increasing stimulus amplitudes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arabzadeh et al., 2014</a>), and do so in a manner that is relatively independent of stimulus frequency, while PC responses saturate at low stimulus amplitudes and are highly frequency-dependent (<a href=\"#bib31\">Muniak et al., 2007</a>). RA firing rates therefore convey a much more informative signal about the amplitude of tactile stimuli than do PC firing rates. That S1 firing rates depend mostly on RA input exploits the fact that these afferents convey unambiguous information about stimulus amplitude. Second, PC afferents exhibit much higher temporal precision in their spiking patterns than do RA afferents (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mackevicius et al., 2012</a>), especially for high-frequency skin vibrations such as those elicited when we run our fingers across a texture (<a href=\"#bib51\">Weber et al., 2013</a>), and this precise spike timing conveys information about tactile events and shapes perception (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mackevicius et al., 2012</a>).

In short, tactile stimuli were delivered to the distal pads of the digits using a stainless steel probe diameter driven by a shaker motor. The shaker motor was calibrated before each experimental run such that stimuli were highly accurate and repeatable. We delivered three types of stimuli that varied in spectral complexity, including simple sinusoids, diharmonic stimuli (only used for the peripheral model fitting), and bandpass noise. The ranges of frequencies and amplitudes spanned the range experienced in everyday tactile experience. While the exact frequencies and amplitudes differed somewhat between the peripheral and cortical data sets, the two stimulus sets were largely overlapping. We were thus able to develop peripheral spiking models that simulated the peripheral responses to the stimuli used in the cortical data set (see below).

To address this issue, we generated different RA and PC populations, using different peripheral models, and also varied the size of the peripheral population used to drive the cortical responses.

We addressed this problem using a two-pronged approach. First, we verified that across our entire data set, temporal and population correlations were low (see below).

In our case, one of the main concerns is whether cross-correlations between RA and PC responses might introduce biases in the recovered filters that would lead us to conclude that both populations contribute input, when in reality only one does. Additionally, the RA and PC responses are autocorrelated, which might bias our estimates of the filter width, or their net excitation or suppression, and thereby erroneously yield different filters for the two populations (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> for the RA/PC covariance matrix). To test whether our method is prone to such biases, we simulated a population of 243 neurons with a variety of different linear filters that differed in width, magnitude, excitation/suppression, temporal offset, and received RA input, PC input, or both. We then used these filters to generate simulated spiking data from the noise vibrations. We set the firing rates to span the range encountered in the measured cortical responses. We then tested whether we could accurately recover the linear filters from the simulated responses and whether there were any biases in the measures we used to quantify these filters. First, we found that the recovered filters matched the filters used to generate the simulated data well (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Second, we verified that our procedure for determining whether neurons received RA input, PC input, or both, worked correctly in the vast majority of cases: 90% of the simulated neurons that received input from both RA and PC populations were identified as such. Importantly, only 3% of simulated neurons that received input from only one of the peripheral populations were misclassified as receiving input from both (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Finally, we also checked whether there might be biases when estimating filter metrics such as overall magnitude, filter width, and excitation/suppression indices in RA as compared to PC filters that might explain the observed differences. We found that these biases were generally very small and in no case could account for the effect sizes observed in the cortical data set (see comparison in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). In summary, our procedure recovers most filter shapes accurately and the small biases that remain cannot account for the observed effect sizes."

In brief, textured surfaces were scanned over the fingertip of human subjects at different scanning speeds, while elicited vibrations were recorded using a Laser Doppler vibrometer (Polytec OFV-3001 with OFV 311 sensor head, Polytec, Inc., Irvine, CA). For each texture, we collected 240 (8 subjects \u00d7 3 speeds \u00d7 10 repetitions) 500-ms long vibration traces. The recorded traces were bandpass-filtered to between 50 and 800 Hz and then served as input to the peripheral RA and PC spiking models. To adjust for the distance-dependent decay of the vibrations and the size of the contact location, we added a global scaling factor for each the RA and PC traces which was set to ensure that the mean simulated RA and PC firing rates matched those recorded using the same set of textures (<a href=\"#bib51\">Weber et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, across textures the recorded and simulated firing rates matched well (<i>r</i> = 0.83 for RA and <i>r</i> = 0.92 for PC responses), indicating that our simulated responses capture actual texture-elicited responses well. Some textures, mainly coarser one, elicit responses not only in RA and PC afferents, but also in SA1 afferents; we excluded textures with an average SA1 contribution &gt;10 Hz from further analysis. Since we were interested in tactile environments that cause both RA and PC afferents to respond, we also excluded textures where the RA or PC average firing rate was below 20 Hz. In total, this left 25 textures, whose elicited vibrations where in the high-frequency range and excited RA and PC but not SA1 afferents."

To estimate <i>p</i>(<i>v</i>), that is, the distribution of stimulus values, we divided the stimulus trace into 1 ms long bins and calculated the absolute value of the deflection amplitude at each time point. The resulting values were divided into 50 bins and <i>p</i>(<i>v</i>) was set to the relative frequencies with which each of the 50 values appeared. We introduced a delay of 15 ms to mimic the response delays observed in cortical responses. For optimization, we calculated the gradient of the mutual information\u00a0<i>I(S,V)</i>\u00a0analytically and then used a standard constrained optimization method (<i>fmincon</i> in Matlab). We restricted the average firing probability, \u03a3<i><sub>t</sub> p</i>(<i>s<sub>t</sub></i>)<i>/T</i>, of the optimized neurons to values observed in our recorded data set to prevent neurons from responding at unnaturally high rates (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tkacik et al., 2010</a>). We found that filters optimized for different firing rates differed in a scale factor, but were otherwise identical. We also used a constant set of parameters for the static nonlinearity; again, we found that these did not affect the shape of the optimized filters but rather changed their scale."

The differentiated traces contain the same frequencies as the original traces, but the higher frequencies are weighted more strongly."

A better figure to look at in reference (Muniak et al., 2007) would be <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> which shows some (weak) SA1 activation even for frequencies above 50 Hz given rather high stimulus amplitudes (with thresholds generally around just below 100 microns). A valid concern is that these SA1 responses (which are currently not accounted for in the model) could bias the estimation of the RA and PC filters. We therefore ran our filter estimation again, this time restricting our data set to noise traces with an RMS amplitude of &lt;50 microns; this conservative threshold all but excludes any possible contribution of SA1 afferents. While the resulting filters were slightly noisier (because fewer data were used to estimate them), all metrics such as the fraction of neurons with convergent input, the filter magnitude ratios, the filter widths, and the excitation/suppression indices almost exactly matched the ones calculated from the full data set. We thus conclude that any SA1 contribution does not affect our results.
