Brood care, a remarkable behavior promoting the survival of the next generation, has evolved independently numerous times among animals including insects. However, fossil evidence of such a complex behavior is exceptionally scarce. Here, we report an ensign scale insect (Hemiptera: Ortheziidae), <i>Wathondara kotejai</i> gen. et sp. nov., from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, which preserves eggs within a wax ovisac, and several freshly hatched nymphs. The new fossil is the only Mesozoic record of an adult female scale insect. More importantly, our finding represents the earliest unequivocal direct evidence of brood care in the insect fossil record and demonstrates a remarkably conserved egg-brooding reproductive strategy within scale insects in stasis for nearly 100 million years."

Brood care, a remarkable behavior promoting the survival of the next generation, has evolved independently numerous times among animals including insects. However, fossil evidence of such a complex behavior is exceptionally scarce. Here, we report an ensign scale insect (Hemiptera: Ortheziidae), <i>Wathondara kotejai</i> gen. et sp. nov., from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, which preserves eggs within a wax ovisac, and several freshly hatched nymphs. The new fossil is the only Mesozoic record of an adult female scale insect. More importantly, our finding represents the earliest unequivocal direct evidence of brood care in the insect fossil record and demonstrates a remarkably conserved egg-brooding reproductive strategy within scale insects in stasis for nearly 100 million years."

The amber comes from northern Myanmar, where amber deposits are around 95\u2013105 million years old. The fossilised insect is an adult female scale insect with a cluster of around 60 eggs on her abdomen. Six young scale insect nymphs are also preserved in the same piece of amber. Wang et al. named this newly discovered species <i>Wathondara kotejai</i>, after an earth goddess in South-East Asian Buddhist mythology and the late Polish entomologist Jan Koteja."

Fossilised adult females are scarcer, most likely because female scale insects are wingless and less mobile and therefore less prone to accidental burial. The fossil reported by Wang et al. is therefore a rare find, and it is also sufficiently well preserved to reveal that the female's eggs are contained within a wax-coated egg sac. Today there are many species of scale insects, most of which are parasites of plants and many are economically important pests of trees and shrubs. In living relatives of <i>W. kotejai</i>, females use a similar wax coating to protect themselves and their offspring: young nymphs hatch inside the egg sac and remain there for a few days before emerging into the outside world."

Fossil evidence of such an ephemeral behavior is extremely rare, reported mainly in dinosaurs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Meng et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Varricchio et al., 2008</a>), ostracods (<a href=\"#bib24\">Siveter et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2014</a>), arachnids (<a href=\"#bib5\">Engel and Grimaldi, 2014</a>), but rarely in insects. Until now only two putative examples in Mesozoic insects have been described based on fossils (<a href=\"#bib20\">Pe\u00f1alver et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Cai et al., 2014</a>). Although phylogenetic analyses suggest some ancient insects evolved brood care (e.g., <a href=\"#bib12\">Korb et al., 2012</a>), only fossils provide unequivocal direct evidence. In this study, we report on an exceptionally preserved insect from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, which represents the earliest unequivocal direct evidence of brood care in the insect fossil record and sheds new light on the early evolution of such behavior."

The thick wax cover not only protects the adult female but also serves to shelter her eggs and first instars. Extant ortheziid females have a band of pores on the ventral side of the abdomen, which secrete a waxy ovisac. The eggs and hatched nymphs are protected within the ovisac (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), as in extant ortheziids and monophlebids (<a href=\"#bib31\">Vogelsang and Szklarzewicz, 2001</a>). In extant species, the young nymphs hatch within this ovisac and remain there for a few days until they have acquired a thin covering of wax secretion (visible in our specimens as a slight white pubescence on the fossil nymphs), then crawl out through a split in the wax at the distal end of the ovisac (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gullan and Kosztarab, 1997</a>). Extant first instars are mobile and serve as principle agents for dispersion and seeking out suitable feeding sites (<a href=\"#bib14\">Koteja, 2001</a>). This egg brooding is widely considered to be a primitive form of brood care (e.g., <a href=\"#bib22\">Royle, et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Wong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Siveter et al., 2014</a>). Some Early Cretaceous cockroaches have been reported with an ootheca attached (<a href=\"#bib7\">Grimaldi and Engel, 2005</a>, Figure 7.72). However, it is not definitive evidence of egg brooding, because some cockroaches subsequently deposit the ootheca in a suitable crevice.

This remarkable behavior takes several forms of which the most common are egg brooding and offspring attendance. Scale insects have evolved a variety of methods to protect their eggs and hatched nymphs from unfavorable abiotic conditions and natural enemies. Some extant species (e.g., Diaspididae, some Pseudococcidae) even possess an ovoviviparous form or pseudoplacental viviparity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gullan and Kosztarab, 1997</a>). In addition to Ortheziidae, ovisacs occur in many other families, for example, Monophlebidae, unrelated Coccidae and many Pseudococcidae, in all of which the secretions of a variety of tubular ducts and disc-pores combine to form the ovisac (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ben-Dov et al., 2014</a>). These various types of ovisacs have evolved convergently to protect their offspring from wet and dry conditions, honeydew contamination, and natural enemies (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gullan and Kosztarab, 1997</a>). Our study demonstrates that these significant behavioral and morphological adaptations, associated with considerable maternal investment, were already well established by the mid-Cretaceous."

This is considered to be the most primitive habit in scale insects (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gullan and Kosztarab, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Koteja, 2001</a>), and similar brood care behavior also occurs in other early scale insects, for example, Margarodidae and Matsucoccidae (<a href=\"#bib14\">Koteja, 2001</a>). Therefore, this behavior probably has an early origin and maybe a synapomorphy for scale insects. Flowering plants and ants are thought to be important drivers for radiation of the most diverse advanced group, the neococcoids (<a href=\"#bib7\">Grimaldi and Engel, 2005</a>). However, both factors are absent in the evolutionary history of basal groups of scale insects (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Brood care, greatly promoting the survival of offspring (<a href=\"#bib22\">Royle et al., 2012</a>), could therefore have been an important driver for the early radiation of scale insects which occurred during the end of the Jurassic or earliest Cretaceous (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

The new fossil is unique in providing evidence of ovarian and juvenile developmental stages in a fossil insect. More remarkably, it represents the earliest direct evidence of brood care in insects and highlights the long-term stasis of this behavior in archaeococcoids, extending nearly 100 million years."

Amber has been recorded from the Shwebo, Thayetmyo, Pakokku, and Pegu districts in Myanmar. However, the only commercial source is the Hukawng Valley in Tanaing Township, Myitkyina District of Kachin State. The amber under study is from an amber mine located near Noije Bum Village, Tanaing Town (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> in <a href=\"#bib11\">Kania et al., 2015</a>). Four institutes (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Lingpoge Amber Museum, Huxuan Amber Museum, and Fushun Amber Institute) have collected more than 100,000 amber pieces from this mine, and each piece commonly contains some insects. All these amber pieces were collected from the \u2018amber layer\u2019. These deposits have been investigated and dated in detail by <a href=\"#bib4\">Cruickshank and Ko (2003)</a> and <a href=\"#bib23\">Shi et al. (2012)</a>. We tentatively followed the age (98.8 \u00b1 0.6 million years) given by U-Pb dating of zircons from the volcaniclastic matrix of the amber (<a href=\"#bib23\">Shi et al., 2012</a>). However, some evidence (e.g., high degree of roundness of amber, bivalve borings on the surface of the amber) suggests that the amber was probably reworked before being deposited in the volcaniclastic matrix."

By merging several photographs of one sample, at different focal planes, a single final photograph was created in which the entire sample was in focus.

There are earlier records of what are close to the ortheziids (e.g., <i>Burmacoccus</i>, from the Early Cretaceous, is pretty clearly an ortheziid, and <i>Cretorthezia</i>, also from the Early Cretaceous, is very probably an ortheziid, although these taxa are based on adult males). It is highly probable that these two genera also had adult females with an ovisac, which would surely only be used for brood care. <a href=\"#bib15\">Koteja and Azar (2008)</a> also described an adult female or late nymph that he placed in <i>Cretorthezia</i> which looked very similar to extant ortheziids and is therefore very likely to have had an ovisac. Emphasising that <i>Palaeorthezia</i> extends crown-group Ortheziidae back only to the mid-Cretaceous therefore seems to overstate their study when there are earlier known probable ortheziid species. This should be explicitly addressed in the manuscript."

The tree is therefore hypothetical and this needs to be stated explicitly. Also, <i>Palaeorthezia</i> is not apparently included. Surely it should be. But, if it were, it would not be the earliest ortheziid in this figure! You need to include the names of the genera you are referring to in numbers 5 (Early Cretaceous Lebanese amber), 6 (Mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber) and 7 (Eocene Baltic Amber). This would make it much easier for other workers to follow the arguments in this paper."
