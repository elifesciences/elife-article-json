                    "text": "When epithelia become too crowded, some cells are extruded that later die. To extrude, a cell produces the lipid, Sphingosine 1-Phosphate (S1P), which activates S1P<sub>2</sub> receptors in neighboring cells that seamlessly squeeze the cell out of the epithelium. Here, we find that extrusion defects can contribute to carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Tumors or epithelia lacking S1P<sub>2</sub> cannot extrude cells apically and instead form apoptotic-resistant masses, possess poor barrier function, and shift extrusion basally beneath the epithelium, providing a potential mechanism for cell invasion. Exogenous S1P<sub>2</sub> expression is sufficient to rescue apical extrusion, cell death, and reduce orthotopic pancreatic tumors and their metastases. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) inhibitor can bypass extrusion defects and could, therefore, target pancreatic, lung, and colon tumors that lack S1P<sub>2</sub> without affecting wild-type tissue."

To extrude, a cell produces the lipid, Sphingosine 1-Phosphate (S1P), which activates S1P<sub>2</sub> receptors in neighboring cells that seamlessly squeeze the cell out of the epithelium. Here, we find that extrusion defects can contribute to carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Tumors or epithelia lacking S1P<sub>2</sub> cannot extrude cells apically and instead form apoptotic-resistant masses, possess poor barrier function, and shift extrusion basally beneath the epithelium, providing a potential mechanism for cell invasion. Exogenous S1P<sub>2</sub> expression is sufficient to rescue apical extrusion, cell death, and reduce orthotopic pancreatic tumors and their metastases. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) inhibitor can bypass extrusion defects and could, therefore, target pancreatic, lung, and colon tumors that lack S1P<sub>2</sub> without affecting wild-type tissue."

The link between cell division and death is critical: if the relative death rate is too high, barrier function diseases may result whereas if division outpaces cell death, epithelia could become neoplastic. We previously identified a process critical for promoting cell death when cells within epithelia become overcrowded termed epithelial extrusion (<a href=\"#bib19\">Rosenblatt et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Eisenhoffer et al., 2012</a>). The stretch-activated channel Piezo-1 senses cell crowding and enables some cells to produce the bioactive sphingolipid, <span class=\"underline\">S</span>phingosine <span class=\"underline\">1</span>-<span class=\"underline\">p</span>hosphate (S1P), which binds G-protein coupled receptors (S1P<sub>2</sub>) in neighboring cells to activate Rho-mediated assembly and contraction of an intercellular actomyosin ring (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gu et al., 2011</a>). This contraction squeezes live cells apically out of the epithelial sheet while simultaneously closing the gap that might have resulted from the cell's exit, thus preserving epithelial barrier function. Because live extruded cells become stripped from the underlying matrix and its associated survival signaling, they later die by anoikis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Frisch and Francis, 1994</a>)."

Typically, epithelia extrude cells apically into the lumen of the tissue (<a href=\"#bib25\">Slattum et al., 2009</a>), which would act to essentially eliminate tumor cells with upregulated survival signaling. However, some cells are extruded basally into the tissue encased by the epithelium (<a href=\"#bib25\">Slattum et al., 2009</a>). If basally extruded cells survive following extrusion, they might be able to invade into the underlying tissue (<a href=\"#bib26\">Slattum and Rosenblatt, 2014</a>). Interestingly, we have found that oncogenic mutations in either adenomatous polyposis coli or K-Ras misregulate apical extrusion and drive extrusion basally (<a href=\"#bib16\">Marshall et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Slattum et al., 2014</a>)."

We found that inhibition of S1P<sub>2</sub> leads to large epithelial masses in both zebrafish epidermis and cultured epithelia and increased rates of basal extrusion. Moreover, disrupting extrusion by a variety of methods leads to chemotherapy resistance. Inhibition of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), a key survival signal generated from cell-matrix adhesion, selectively promotes apoptosis in cells where extrusion is defective and eliminates epidermal cell masses formed in zebrafish S1P<sub>2</sub> mutants without affecting epithelial morphology and function. Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinomas (PDACs) have little to no S1P<sub>2</sub>, which could explain why these tumors are typically more invasive and chemo-resistant. HPAF II human pancreatic cancer cells cannot extrude apically and instead extrude basally, survive, and proliferate following extrusion. Ectopically expressing S1P<sub>2</sub> in HPAF II cells rescues apical extrusion and apoptosis and reduces orthotopic mouse tumors and their metastases. Together, our results suggest that defective extrusion may be a new mechanism for how PDACs and other carcinomas lacking S1P<sub>2</sub> initiate and invade. Furthermore, FAK inhibitors, which are currently in clinical trials for other tumors, may provide an effective therapeutic opportunity to treat pancreatic cancer without destroying nearby normal tissue."

Since freshly plated single MDCK cells are resistant to apoptotic stimuli, we tested if these same compounds reduced apoptosis in similarly aged single MDCKs by treating with EGTA to disrupt cadherin-dependent cell\u2013cell contacts. Inhibitors that blocked apoptosis by blocking extrusion in an intact monolayer do not impact the apoptosis rates of single cells that are incapable of extrusion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Similarly, UV-induced apoptosis was unaltered in single HBE cells lacking S1P<sub>2</sub> when HBE monolayers where treated with EGTA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

While \u223c50% of cells did not extrude, most of the remaining cells extruded in the opposite direction\u2014basally, underneath the layer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>) at rates similar to when MDCK monolayers are treated with S1P<sub>2</sub> antagonist (<a href=\"#bib24\">Slattum et al., 2014</a>).

To investigate if basally extruded cells can survive following extrusion (<a href=\"#bib26\">Slattum and Rosenblatt, 2014</a>), we analyzed extrusion from three-dimensional cysts, where the fate of basally extruded cells can be followed outside the cyst, rather than beneath a monolayer.

If so, increased cell survival when extrusion is blocked would derive from prolonged cell attachment to the underlying matrix. Since Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is critical for matrix-dependent survival (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frisch et al., 1996</a>), we investigated if FAK were increased in cells targeted for death when extrusion was blocked. Surprisingly, we found that control MDCK cells in early stages of extrusion have far higher levels of active FAK, by immunostaining with a phospho-FAK antibody, than surrounding live cells but that these levels decrease during later stages of extrusion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This increase in pro-survival phospho-FAK in cells targeted to die mimics the increased levels of S1P, another pro-survival signal, in cells triggered to extrude and die that also decrease once cells extrude (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and [<a href=\"#bib12\">Gu et al., 2011</a>]). However, late-staged apoptotic cells (detected by piknotic DNA) still have high levels of active FAK when extrusion is blocked with S1P<sub>2</sub> antagonist (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This paradoxical survival signaling increase in cells targeted to die may reflect cell-intrinsic compensatory signals to apoptotic signaling that eventually decrease as cells commit to apoptosis. The fact that these survival signals stay high when cell extrusion is blocked suggests that this increased survival signaling derives from inability to detach from matrix."

The specific FAK inhibitor PF 573228 had no effect on untreated or UV-treated wild type monolayers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and [<a href=\"#bib23\">Slack-Davis et al., 2007</a>]), likely because cells not targeted to extrude have quite low levels of active FAK (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). However, this same FAK inhibitor rescued the cell death rates of monolayers where extrusion is blocked with S1P<sub>2</sub> antagonist JTE013 or Rac inhibitor to those seen in wild type monolayers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). FAK inhibitor dramatically decreased phospho-FAK staining in cells where JTE013 blocks extrusion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Over-expression of a dominant negative FAK isoform (FRNK) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Park et al., 2004</a>) acted similarly to FAK inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Importantly, FAK inhibitor alone induced apoptosis of HPAF II cells in monolayers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) and even those basally extruding from HPAF II cysts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). Additionally, treatment with FAK inhibitor to cysts that had already accumulated live basally extruded cells was sufficient to nearly double apoptosis rates of basally extruded cells (from 15 \u00b1 2% to 28 <span class=\"underline\">\u00b1</span> 3%) when added for only 2 hr."

While FAK inhibitor had no visible effect on wild-type zebrafish at 5 dpf, it greatly decreased the number and size of epidermal cell masses in S1P<sub>2</sub>-mutant embryos of the same age (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). While FAK inhibitor treatment sloughed off many of the epidermal cells, which could be found at the bottom of the dish, it also increased the apoptosis rate within the masses (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). To test if FAK inhibitor could eliminate epidermal masses <i>after</i> they form, we needed to inducibly knockdown S1P<sub>2</sub> later in development, since Mil zebrafish mutants die due to heart defects around the time cell masses form (\u223c5 dpf; [<a href=\"#bib14\">Kupperman et al., 2000</a>]). To do so, we used we photo-activated S1P<sub>2</sub> morpholino at 24 hpf (see [<a href=\"#bib7\">Eisenhoffer et al., 2012</a>] for characterization of this method) to knockdown S1P<sub>2</sub> after heart development occurred. S1P<sub>2</sub> morphants had 0.18-fold lower S1P<sub>2</sub> protein levels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) and phenocopied the epidermal masses seen in Mil mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Addition of FAK inhibitor to an S1P<sub>2</sub> morphant at 5 dpf with epidermal masses caused the masses to slough off within 19 hr (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>, where n = 6 videos total). Remarkably, we found that while <i>Mil</i> embryos had poor epidermal barrier function, as assayed by Texas Red-Dextran<sup>MW70</sup> permeability, epidermal permeability was significantly reduced with FAK inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). These results suggest that FAK inhibitor alone may selectively target masses resulting from cells defective in extrusion and improve overall epithelial integrity without affecting the normal surrounding tissue."

We found that S1P<sub>2</sub> was significantly lower in pancreatic cancer (PDAC) cells compared to epithelial acini from uninvolved neck margins, from which PDACs may arise, or to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) precursor lesions (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013C</a>).

Normal epithelial cells produce S1P to trigger their extrusion and death once they become too crowded, simultaneously maintaining correct cell density and barrier function. Epithelia with defective S1P/S1P<sub>2</sub> signaling cannot extrude apically. Extrusion-defective epithelia retain cells, which can result in resistance to homeostatic and chemotherapy-induced cell death and neoplastic masses. Further, a small number of cells also die without getting extruded, which can disrupt barrier function. Aside from allowing access of inappropriate signals, poor epithelia barrier function could cause chronic inflammation\u2014an important factor for tumor progression (<a href=\"#bib6\">Coussens and Werb, 2002</a>).

Here, pro-survival signals phospho-FAK and S1P (which also promotes extrusion) increase in an early extruding cell but decrease once a cell is extruded and targeted to die (right, cell with piknotic nucleus). However, when apical extrusion is blocked due to lack of S1P<sub>2</sub> receptor (bottom panel), epithelial cells do not die and can accumulate (left cell and those accumulating above) from increased matrix-derived survival signaling (arrows from matrix neighboring cells signaling to P-FAK). Additionally, cells can still basally extrude, which could potentially enable their invasion beneath the layer (right cell). Basally extruded cells may also have high P-FAK, since they are sensitive to FAK inhibitor when extruded into matrix in vitro, yet this point will be critical to test in vivo in disseminating tumors. Other cells may still die but not extrude (grey-blue cell with piknotic nucleus), leading to poor barrier function and inflammation, which could also promote tumor progression."

We have recently discovered that oncogenic KRas<sup>V12</sup> expression degrades S1P through autophagy and causes cell masses and basal extrusion, similar to the extrusion defects observed when S1P<sub>2</sub> is absent (<a href=\"#bib24\">Slattum et al., 2014</a>). KRas<sup>V12</sup> is an important driver for the same cancers that lack S1P<sub>2</sub>\u2014pancreatic, lung, and colon carcinomas\u2014and its expression alone reduces S1P<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Slattum et al., 2014</a>), which may explain why PanIN precursors have reduced S1P<sub>2</sub> expression. Further, we have found that another oncogenic mutation, truncation of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene, also results in increased basal extrusion. While it is not clear what mechanisms drive tumor cell invasion, our work showing that exogenous expression of S1P<sub>2</sub> can dramatically reduce basal extrusion rates and orthotopic tumor metastasis rates in tumor cells that lack this receptor suggests that S1P<sub>2</sub>-mediated extrusion may play an important role in metastatic cell invasion."

Surprisingly, FAK inhibitor could also reverse other extrusion defects, such as poor barrier function and survival of basally extruded cells, factors that together could contribute to tumor progression. The fact that adding FAK inhibitor can rescue these defects when added after they form further supports the notion that anoikis results from extrusion and also suggests that FAK inhibitors may be particularly good at treating pancreatic and other carcinomas defective in extrusion. Moreover, we expect a specific FAK inhibitor to not cause the common toxicities associated with standard chemotherapies, as it does not affect normal epithelial tissue. Another FAK inhibitor, PF-00562271, reduces tumor growth, metastases, and ameliorates tumor microenvironment when used in an orthotopic mouse model for pancreatic cancer (<a href=\"#bib27\">Stokes et al., 2011</a>), suggesting this drug could be promising for pancreatic cancer patients. However, it is important to note that PF-00562271 also inhibits a FAK-related kinase Pyk-2, which promotes non-specific cell death (<a href=\"#bib20\">Schultze and Fiedler, 2011</a>). The phase I clinical trial for PF-00562271 showed that while this drug was tolerated fairly well, it did cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (<a href=\"#bib13\">Infante et al., 2012</a>), symptoms indicative of poor gut barrier function, likely due to excessive non-specific apoptosis. Our results suggest that a newer more specific FAK inhibitor, such as VS-4718 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Shapiro et al., 2014</a>), may provide a more targeted therapy for patients with pancreatic and lung carcinomas that have aberrant extrusion signaling without the common toxicities associated with older chemotherapies."

We find that cancer cells that lack the extrusion-signaling axis not only have reduced cell death rates but also have poor barrier function and a propensity to extrude cells basally, properties that could lead to higher invasion and metastatic rates. Therefore, aberrant extrusion signaling in pancreatic and lung carcinomas could not only contribute to tumor initiation but also progression. Importantly, specific inhibition of FAK, which does not disrupt normal epithelial tissue, is sufficient to reverse all of the effects of disrupted extrusion and could provide a better, less toxic therapy for this aggressive class of tumors."

They show that this coincides with loss of both cell extrusion and apoptosis and use a variety of experimental approaches to argue that the primary defect is a failure of extrusion.

The current data and text suggest that the protection results from prolonged attachment of cells and thus exposure to competing survival signaling through FAK. For example, the text states: \u201cBecause extrusion normally drives cell death, could it also help promote apoptosis in response to apoptotic stimuli by eliminating competing survival signaling associated with the underlying matrix\u201d (paragraph two in the Results section). However, if this were the case, why does FAK inhibition in control cells not increase cell death upon UV treatment? Would it increase cell death in response to some of the chemotherapy drug treatments?

In both cases, S1P signaling through the S1P<sub>2</sub> receptor drives extrusion. In the first case, cells are extruded alive that later die via Piezo-1. In the second case, cells are extruded as part of the death pathway (likely via caspase activation)\u2014here we find that extrusion also helps promote the death but because apoptosis has been activated, the cells are often dying while they extrude. I think we may need to make this clearer in our article that in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, cells amass from reduced rates of intrinsic homeostatic extrusion-dependent cell death, whereas in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a>, we induced cell death with a strong apoptotic stimulus, UV-C. When we induce apoptosis, the low intrinsic rates of live cell extrusion become dwarfed by those induced to die\u2014therefore, most cells that do extrude will be caspase-positive. While some cells die when the extrusion pathway is disrupted, it is greatly reduced due to competing cell survival coming from prolonged attachment of cells (that should have died) to the matrix and its survival signaling through FAK."

While phospho-FAK is high in early-staged extruding cells, it decreases dramatically late in extrusion, as the cells become apoptotic. The same is true for S1P lipid, which is a survival factor in addition to triggering extrusion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#bib12\">Gu et al., JCB, 2011</a>). When extrusion is blocked and cells remain in contact with matrix, phospho-FAK (and S1P) remains high, which is likely why these cells alone are susceptible to FAK inhibitor. While there is a low basal level of phospho-FAK (and S1P) in the surrounding live cells, it seems that cells targeted to die respond by upregulating their survival signaling to compete with the apoptotic signaling. Presumably, apoptosis occurs if the apoptotic signaling wins over survival signaling.

This also explains why FAK inhibitor exclusively targets cells for death that were blocked from extruding whereas it does not affect neighboring cells with low levels of FAK.

While some of the lumens were a bit skewed in both MDCKs and HPAFII, quantification was done on the majority of cysts that were spherical on our wide-field microscope so we could get high numbers. There really is no difference in size."
