Withdrawal is essential for development and has been a morphogenetic puzzle. Here, we use new fluorescent transgenic lines in the beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> to show that the EE tissues dynamically form a basal-basal epithelial bilayer, contradicting the previous hypothesis of EE intercalation. We find that the EE tissues repeatedly detach and reattach throughout development and have distinct roles. Quantitative live imaging analyses show that the amnion initiates EE rupture in a specialized anterior-ventral cap. RNAi phenotypes demonstrate that the serosa contracts autonomously. Thus, apposition in a bilayer enables the amnion as 'initiator' to coordinate with the serosa as 'driver' to achieve withdrawal. This EE strategy may reflect evolutionary changes within the holometabolous insects and serves as a model to study interactions between developing epithelia."

Now, Hilbrant et al. have used genetically engineered red flour beetles in which the cells of the amnion produce a fluorescent protein that can be viewed under a microscope. This allowed the amnion to be observed in living specimens during beetle embryo development, and revealed that the amnion attaches and detaches from the serosa more than once as the embryo develops. Furthermore, the amnion and serosa remain as distinct tissues as they withdraw from the embryo."

This region of the amnion breaks apart first, and the serosa breaks open a few minutes afterwards. Once the two layers have broken, they pull back from the embryo like a pillowcase being turned inside out as it is removed from a pillow. In normal beetles, this process is quite rapid and squeezes the embryo\u2019s abdomen. But in beetles genetically manipulated to lack a serosa the process is slower because the amnion is not strong enough by itself to squeeze the embryo."

In parallel to the amniote vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib4\">Calvin and Oyen, 2007</a>), the insects have evolved extraembryonic (EE) tissues that arise in early embryogenesis to envelop the embryo (<a href=\"#bib25\">Panfilio, 2008</a>). These are the amnion and the serosa, which are both simple, squamous epithelia. Like its vertebrate namesake, in most insect species the amnion encloses a fluid-filled cavity around the embryo. As the outermost cellular layer, the serosa provides mechanical and physiological protection (<a href=\"#bib8\">Farnesi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jacobs et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Rezende et al., 2008</a>).

However, research on <i>Drosophila</i> cannot address the morphogenesis of the two EE epithelia directly, due to the secondarily derived nature of its single EE tissue, the amnioserosa, which does not surround the embryo (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rafiqi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Schmidt-Ott, 2000</a>)."

However, a major open question has been the organization and role of the amnion. This is primarily because it is difficult to visualize in its native topography with respect to other tissues. A lack of amnion-specific molecular markers (discussed in <a href=\"#bib18\">Koelzer et al., 2014</a>) and the histological similarity and proximity of the serosa (<a href=\"#bib24\">Panfilio and Roth, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">van der Zee et al., 2005</a>) have been particular challenges."

The topographical arrangement of the tissues differs strikingly from what was previously known in hemimetabolous insects and what had previously been hypothesized for <i>Tribolium</i>. To better appreciate the implications of this arrangement for morphogenesis, we situate these observations in the larger context of EE development at preceding and following stages. This global, mesoscopic approach to evaluating tissue interactions significantly improves our understanding the entire withdrawal process, including the first detailed examination of EE rupture in any insect. Furthermore, we provide evidence that while the serosa strongly drives the contraction and folding of the tissues, the amnion initiates EE rupture."

Relative EGFP signal quantification is plotted as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation during a 48-hr time-lapse recording, with corresponding values for landmark developmental stages (GBE, germband extension; GBR, germband retraction; SR, serosal rupture; MT, muscle twitches). Note that 'serosal rupture' is the staging term but in fact refers to first discernible rupture of both EE tissues at the beginning of withdrawal morphogenesis. Landmark stage values are also based on nGFP embryos that were recorded in parallel for calibration (combined n\u00a0= 7\u201323 embryos per stage). Vertical red lines indicate the mean SR age. In <b>A</b>, relative EGFP signal is the mean grey value (n\u00a0= 10), shown for minimum age (from a four-hr egg collection) relative to serosal rupture. In <b>B</b>, signal is the integrated density of the posterior and anterior egg halves (0\u201350% <i>vs</i>. 50\u2013100% egg length) for embryos recorded in both lateral and ventral aspect (n\u00a0= 5), with standard deviation shown on only one side of each plot for clarity. Here, the x-axis shows minimum absolute age in hours after egg lay (hours AEL). Vertical black lines and asterisks indicate the first time points at which the anterior and posterior EGFP values differ significantly (*:\u00a0p&lt;0.05, **:\u00a0p&lt;0.01 for paired, two-tailed <i>t</i>-tests). Although this difference in part reflects the relative area of visible amnion in lateral aspect (greater anteriorly), the trend still holds when only embryos in ventral aspect are considered (uniform relative amnion surface area). (<b><b>C</b>)</b> In our examination of rupture initiation in the amnion (HC079) \u00d7 heart (G04609) cross compared to the serosa (G12424) \u00d7 heart (G04609) cross, we found that the amnion cross develops at a faster rate, shown here as the minimum age at the time of serosal rupture (x-axis; amnion cross: 3007 (median) \u00b1 81 (MAD) min, n\u00a0= 28; serosal cross: 3168 (median) \u00b1 85 (MAD) min, n\u00a0= 30; <i>p\u00a0</i>= 4.942e-06, Mann-Whitney U test), shown in relation to the duration of rupture initiation (y-axis: same as main text <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). However, even when a normalization factor was introduced to adjust for developmental rate, rupture initiation is longer in the amnion background.

Initially the two EE tissues are physically separate (<a href=\"#bib10\">Handel et al., 2005</a>), but they progressively come together during early germband retraction until the only clearly discernible amniotic region is a rim of tissue at the embryo\u2019s dorsal margin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A-A2</a>). Previous histological studies in <i>Tribolium</i> and other holometabolous insects concluded that the region of overlap throughout the ventral half of the egg comprised a single EE cell layer, the EE tissues having intercalated or otherwise 'fused'\u00a0(e.g., <a href=\"#bib16\">Kobayashi and Ando, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Patten, 1884</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">van der Zee et al., 2005</a>). Alternatively, this structure was interpreted as only serosa (<a href=\"#bib23\">Panfilio et al., 2013</a>), as the underlying amniotic region undergoes apoptosis in a hemimetabolous insect, the milkweed bug <i>Oncopeltus fasciatus</i> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Panfilio and Roth, 2010</a>). In fact, we find that both tissues persist as apposed and very thin but distinct squamous epithelial layers that are evident in both sectioned and whole mount material (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Apposition occurs over the entire surface area of the amnion except its dorsal rim, such that the serosa and amnion form an extensive epithelial bilayer. Several hours after the completion of germband retraction, the EE membranes rupture and withdraw from the embryo (<a href=\"#bib18\">Koelzer et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, the amnion-serosa bilayer is maintained throughout withdrawal morphogenesis, with all major folds and minor bends involving both EE tissue sheets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The new amnion EGFP line thus sheds light on EE tissue structure during withdrawal: rather than a single, pseudostratified tissue, each EE tissue persists as a monolayer, representing a novel EE tissue organization compared to what is known for other species. Given that the amnion persists as a discrete tissue throughout withdrawal morphogenesis, we then investigated its role in this process, starting with its structure at the onset of rupture."

Moreover, the amnion and serosa have strikingly different cellular morphologies, enabling cells of both tissues to be distinguished, with the serosa overlying the amnion. (<b>A\u2013C</b>) Both EE tissues can be discerned as continuous epithelia within the rupture competence zone (shown after the completion of germband retraction, at 44\u201348\u2009hr after egg lay). Shown are two examples with serosal EGFP (<b>A\u2013B</b>) and one with amniotic EGFP (<b>C</b>, reproduced from main text <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, for comparison). 'Overview' images show lateral, ventral, and ventral-lateral views of maximum intensity projections (<b>A1</b>,<b>B1</b>,<b>C1</b>, respectively) with anterior left and the region of interest around the head appendages indicated by the blue boxed region (due to the curvature of the egg, only the regions actually visible in high-magnification projections of thinner z-stacks are indicated). 'Merge' images (<b>A2</b>,<b>B2</b>,<b>C2</b>) show maximum intensity projections of the indicated region, labeled for F-Actin (red, phalloidin), nuclei (blue, DAPI), and the specified EE tissue (green, EGFP). Note that embryonic-specific signal (F-Actin and DAPI signal for small cells not in contact with the tissue at the egg surface) was manually deleted from deeper optical sections with the freehand selection tool in ImageJ before rendering the projected images shown here. 'Schematic' images (<b>A3</b>,<b>B3</b>,<b>C3</b>) show cell and nuclear outlines. Cell outlines were determined by EGFP signal (for <b>A3</b>,<b>B3</b>,<b>C3</b>) and F-Actin signal (for <b>C3</b>, for serosal outlines only). Nuclear outlines were determined by EGFP signal or DAPI (for all EGFP-negative nuclei only). Serosal cells are shown in cyan or blue; amniotic nuclei and cells are shown in orange or white. Dashed outlines highlight individual serosal (red) and amniotic (orange) cells, which are also labeled by arrows of the same color in the single-channel micrographs for EGFP (<b>A4</b>,<b>B4</b>,<b>C4</b>) and F-Actin (<b>A5</b>,<b>B5</b>,<b>C5</b>). Strong F-Actin signal correlates with serosal cell shape (compare <b>A4</b>,<b>A5</b> and <b>B4</b>,<b>B5</b>), such that F-Actin signal can be used to infer serosal cell shape even when that tissue is not labeled with EGFP (<b>C3</b>,<b>C5</b>). Furthermore, the F-Actin-inferred serosal cell outlines correspond to EGFP-negative nuclei in the amnion enhancer trap line (<b>C3</b>). Note that in order to preserve anterior-ventral EE tissue structure and topography, the specimens presented here (<b>A\u2013C</b>) are still within the vitelline membrane. After fixation, embryos were cut in half (transversely) with a razor blade to allow the phalloidin and DAPI staining reagents to penetrate into the sample. (The EGFP is the endogenous signal.) (<b>D\u2013E</b>). For over a day prior to rupture, no cell mixing or change in cell number occurs in either the serosa (<b>D</b>) or the amnion (<b>E</b>). Selected stills from time-lapse movies are shown at the times indicated relative to rupture (at 30\u00b0C, z-stacks acquired every 2 min), in anterior aspect and oriented with the ventral region uppermost, with light sheet illumination coming from above. Individual nuclei were tracked hourly (uniquely colored tracks), showing the static nature of serosal cells until the time of rupture, while amniotic nuclei move much more within the cells and the amniotic tissue itself shifts slightly anterior-dorsally. The initial opening at the time of rupture is indicated with an asterisk (<b>D4</b>,<b>E4</b>). Axes were determined based on weak embryonic signal (<b>D5</b>,<b>E5</b>; the withdrawing edge of the amnion is still visible in <b>E5</b>). Images shown here are maximum intensity projections with gamma corrections 0.5 (serosa) and 0.7 (amnion) as well as brightness correction to accommodate for changes in signal intensity of these lines during development (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#bib18\">Koelzer et al., 2014</a>). For these specimens, cellular details at the time of rupture are shown in main text <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013E</a>. Acquisition details are specified in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>.

The red box on the semithin section (1\u00a0\u00b5m thick, stained with toluidine blue) approximately indicates the anterior-ventral region shown in <b>F2\u2013F3</b>. The arrow highlights an intercellular junction within the serosa (<b>F2</b>), and false coloring highlights the continuity of the two distinct epithelial layers (<b>F3</b>).

Remarkably, definitive rupture initiates not only by intercellular separation but in some cases by intracellular hole formation (<i>e.g.,</i> <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D1-D2</a>: red cell). Among recordings with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution, we followed intracellular opening in three specimens. In the example shown here, thin cytoplasmic remnants of the affected cell that were distant from the nucleus and main cell body could be tracked initially, but these may fragment as the opening enlarges to the circumference of the egg. However, the nuclei (and main cell body) of cells at the site of rupture can be followed during withdrawal and appear to contribute to the persistent edge of the tissue (also in <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). These cellular contortions do not occur in the serosa, where cells at the site of rupture separate from their neighbors by spatial translation without substantial deviation from regular, polygonal cell shapes with centrally positioned nuclei (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E1-E2</a>). Meanwhile, at no time prior to or during rupture did we observe cell loss in the amnion (see also <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). There is also no discernible change in apical area or EGFP brightness of amniotic cells directly involved in rupture compared to cells elsewhere in the amniotic cap, such that the onset of rupture appears very abrupt. Thus, rupture in <i>Tribolium</i> within a specialized competence zone of the amnion is fundamentally different to the strategy in <i>Oncopeltus</i>. In the latter species, gradual apoptosis of the amnion at the rupture site begins over a day (16% development) before rupture occurs but is in itself insufficient as a proximate trigger, which remains unknown (<a href=\"#bib24\">Panfilio and Roth, 2010</a>)."

We find that rupture initiation in <i>Tribolium</i> \u2013 defined as the short interval of initial opening of the EE membranes \u2013 is significantly longer in the amnion than in the serosa (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F-G</a>, [p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U test; see Materials and methods for details of the landmarks that delimit this interval). This is also true even when slight differences in developmental rate between genetic backgrounds are considered (see also <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This result, supported by the distinct morphological appearance of the amnion at the site of rupture (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), suggests that the amnion initiates rupture. The serosa then ruptures after a slight delay of a few minutes. Indeed, the difference in initiation duration corresponds morphologically to only a slight opening of the amnion, generally no larger than the area of the anterior-ventral cap region (82%, <i>n\u00a0</i>= 28, data set from <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), before the serosa would also perceptibly rupture and then catch up with the amnion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). We therefore hypothesize that the amniotic rupture competence zone may differ from the rest of the tissue in the nature of its attachment to the serosa (also based on tracking data in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013E</a>), given that the edges of the two tissues then retain apposition throughout subsequent withdrawal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>: arrow). Before evaluating the progression of withdrawal in detail (below, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), we then completed our assessment of EE rupture by analyzing how preceding events in early development restrict the source of upstream signals to determine the site of rupture."

At the blastoderm stage, the amnion and serosa initially share a lateral tissue boundary within the plane of the blastoderm epithelium (<a href=\"#bib41\">van der Zee et al., 2005</a>). As the EE tissues envelop the embryo, they maintain that boundary until they separate into discrete membranes at the serosal window closure stage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Benton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Handel et al., 2000</a>). As the EE tissues separate, serosal cells rapidly acquire fixed positions under the vitelline membrane (<a href=\"#bib18\">Koelzer et al., 2014</a>), while internally the embryo and amnion are not so tethered. Indeed, we find that over half of all embryos examined (59%, <i>n\u00a0</i>= 69) rotate longitudinally during early germband extension relative to the serosa: up to 90\u00ba about the anterior-posterior axis, with a tendency to rest laterally (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). More generally, rotation occurs irrespective of whether the embryo\u2019s long axis is orthogonal (this study) or parallel (data in <a href=\"#bib37\">Strobl and Stelzer, 2014</a>) to gravity, suggesting an inherent anisotropy of the early egg. However, there is no counterpart rotation in later development (<i>n\u00a0</i>= 118), including for 15 embryos filmed continuously and which exhibited typical frequencies of early rotation. In other words, 9 of 15 embryos rotated longitudinally such that the site of serosal window closure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>: boxed region) did not correspond to the site of later EE tissue rupture (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>: starburst). The time window for rotation ends shortly before the onset of amnion-serosa adhesion to form the bilayer during germband retraction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, early rotation without any later reversal is a feature of wild type <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis. This physically uncouples apposition of the mature amnion and serosa from the tissues\u2019 relative orientation when they had initially detached from one another."

We previously observed a subtle morphological change in serosal cells over the yolk compared to those over the amnion, and this change only arises during germband retraction (<a href=\"#bib18\">Koelzer et al., 2014</a>), which correlates with the time of EE tissue apposition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Thus, the region of amniotic specialization for rupture may be autonomous (<i>e.g.</i>, corresponding to where it ultimately closed at the serosal window stage) or induced by signals from the underlying embryo, but is unlikely to be determined by the serosa."

The serosa appears to be the driving force for withdrawal. We had previously observed that the serosa facilitates the final stages of withdrawal during dorsal closure, making the process more robust and efficient (<a href=\"#bib23\">Panfilio et al., 2013</a>).

Wild type withdrawal is rapid, with visible squeezing of the embryo\u2019s abdomen as the posterior EE tissue edge pulls back and clears the posterior pole. In tracking the edge of the EE tissues during withdrawal, the squeezing is manifest in the degree to which the tissue pulls away from the eggshell (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>: bracketed track segment represents 1 min at 21\u00b0C). This is due to serosa-specific enrichment in apical F-actin as the cells undergo a drastic shape change to become pseudocolumnar (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, also <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2032</a>). Indeed, wild type specimens occasionally exhibited a transient extra fold in the posterior EE tissue (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,C\u2032</a>: double-headed arrow). This likely reflects a degree of stochasticity in tissue relaxation after snapping over the abdomen, similar to kinetic descriptions in other species (e.g., <a href=\"#bib27\">Patten, 1884</a>). Both the histological and kinetic situations are altered in the absence of the serosa. In <i>Tc-zen1<sup>RNAi</sup></i> embryos the amnion does withdraw dorsally, but over a much longer time scale and without sufficient force to squeeze the abdomen away from the eggshell (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>: entire track represents 3.9\u2009hr at 21\u00b0C). The slow progression is in part due to the tissue ruffling into folds rather than everting via apical constriction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>: red bracket corresponds to the red track segment in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Consistent with a lack of apical constriction, the amnion alone shows no significant F-actin enrichment or increase in cell height (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

In the absence of rupture, the embryo remains confined within the amniotic cavity at the time when dorsal closure is initiated by the epidermal flanks. With nowhere else to go, the flanks grow along the inner surface of the intact amnion until they meet at the ventral midline, resulting in a ventral closure of the body over the legs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Panfilio, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sander, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Truckenbrodt, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">van der Zee et al., 2005</a>). This manipulation allowed us to examine the serosa\u2019s inherent morphogenetic properties without rupture as a trigger event. We find that the <i>Tc-zen2<sup>RNAi</sup></i>serosa still contracts strongly even in the absence of rupture. Although the amniotic cavity remains unopened and there are no free EE tissue edges, the serosa contracts until it tears ectopically, withdrawing ventrally over the amnion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013G</a>: shown mid contraction, when the serosa only occupies a small surface area over the egg). We infer that the serosa remains attached throughout the bilayer region and pulls on the underlying amnion, which would account for the displacement of the embryo\u2019s head away from the anterior pole (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>: note yolk anterior to the head). This phenotype and the autonomous nature of serosal contractility in <i>Tribolium</i> are conserved compared to <i>Oncopeltus</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Panfilio, 2009</a>). As this contrasts with the differences between these species in amnion structure and behavior, discussed above, it appears that there is a degree of modularity or independence in how the two epithelia have evolved. This is an unexpected conclusion, given the need for tight coordination between these tissues in any one species."

Whether visualized for the serosa (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>) or amnion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>), the nature of embryonic constriction is consistent with the intact portions of the tissues maintaining adhesion throughout the region of apposition and therefore contracting together. Thus, we propose a model in which correct rupture of the amnion is required for directed EE tissue withdrawal, while the serosa autonomously provides the motive force to achieve this. Adhesion of the EE tissues throughout the region of apposition provides the means to couple these two functions."

Importantly, it has previously been described as comprising only serosal tissue. The amnion is restricted to attachment to the serosa at its lateral edges in many species (<a href=\"#bib7\">Enslee and Riddiford, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Panfilio and Roth, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Tojo and Machida, 1997</a>). Alternatively, it was regarded as fully enveloping the serosa as a smooth outer layer (<a href=\"#bib30\">Rempel and Church, 1971</a>), if a distinct amnion was recognized (see first Results\u00a0and\u00a0discussion subsection). The persistent bilayered structure of the <i>Tribolium</i> EE tissues, however, results in both a serosal dorsal organ and a nested, amniotic dorsal organ (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In light of these observations, re-analysis of late serosa-less <i>Tc-zen1<sup>RNAi</sup></i> embryos indicates that the previously observed region of anterior-medial amniotic F-actin enrichment (<a href=\"#bib23\">Panfilio et al., 2013</a>) corresponds to the amniotic dorsal organ, demonstrating that this structure also forms in the absence of a serosa. Thus, at the end of the EE tissues\u2019 lifetimes, they once again function as independent structures, involving separation of the bilayer as the tissues degenerate separately (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

It was previously known that the <i>Tribolium</i> EE tissues arise from the same blastodermal cell sheet before enclosing the embryo and detaching from one another (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib3\">Benton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Handel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Koelzer et al., 2014</a>). After those early stages, the structure and arrangement of the amnion had been obscure. Here, we have characterized a new genetic resource in the form of the HC079 enhancer trap line that literally illuminates this enigmatic tissue for the first time. Following its early detachment from the serosa, the amnion often rotates relative to the serosa (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) before reattaching to form the bilayer (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Then, given that the EE tissues withdraw from the embryo as a single unit (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), the re-establishment of their independence during final degeneration at the dorsal organ stage is striking (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>)."

The apposed surfaces (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D</a>) present a basal-basal interface where they presumably interact via the basement membrane, which is known to influence both cell adhesion and shape changes at tissue folds during embryogenesis in many animal systems (<a href=\"#bib6\">Daley and Yamada, 2013</a>). Furthermore, the bilayer structure and its rupture in <i>Tribolium</i> have intriguing parallels with vulval development in <i>C. elegans</i>, where two apposed epithelial sheets must also be opened. In the roundworm, the uterine and ventral epidermal layers are juxtaposed but separated by their respective basement membranes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Morrissey et al., 2014</a>). This barrier is breached when the specialized anchor cell of the inner uterine tissue initiates a sequence of extracellular remodeling events to connect the two layers (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hagedorn and Sherwood, 2011</a>). It will be interesting to see whether similar approaches to local basement membrane removal and gap widening (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ihara et al., 2011</a>) also occur during insect EE rupture, a rapid event that occurs nearly an order of magnitude more quickly than anchor cell invasion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Hagedorn and Sherwood, 2011</a>). Also, in contrast to a system of invasive cell behavior in which cell cycle regulation and the balance of mitosis among neighboring cells contribute to basement membrane breach and widening, respectively (<a href=\"#bib19\">Matus et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">2015</a>), the insect EE tissues enter the endocycle and mature to a polyploid state before rupture (<a href=\"#bib23\">Panfilio et al., 2013</a>). The withdrawing EE tissues of <i>Tribolium</i> thus provide a new system for investigating restructuring of the basement membrane and the cellular-extracellular matrix in simple epithelia."

Curiously, serosal cells seem to flatten (lose peripheral EGFP signal) prior to rupture (compare <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E1-E2</a>), and partial dissociation of some serosal cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E2</a>: blue cells) is observed during rupture, although epithelial integrity is maintained during withdrawal. Might this represent a more brittle approach to rupture in which the serosa effectively shatters, compared to the flexibility of opening amniotic cells? In future work, it will be important to elucidate how cells in the amnion and serosa differ in their mechanical properties (<a href=\"#bib17\">Koehl, 1990</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i> it was recently shown that non-muscle myosin II plays a nuanced role in tuning the mechanical properties of the peripodial epithelium so that it can rupture and withdraw from the wing imaginal disc columnar tissue (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aldaz et al., 2013</a>).

However, this transcription factor is also expressed throughout the serosa, and we find that its knockdown impairs both EE tissues without specifically affecting amnion anterior-ventral differentiation (data not shown), indicating that other regulators control cap formation. Identifying the molecular cues for amniotic regionalization and the proximate triggers for rupture itself will further clarify the amnion\u2019s role."

While limited data are available for holometabolous insects with complete EE tissues, hemimetabolous insects have been more extensively studied and have a different arrangement. Hemimetabolous EE withdrawal, known as katatrepsis, involves the embryo being pulled out of the yolk by the EE tissues. The requirements for katatrepsis restrict amnion-serosa connection to a distinct border region with lateral-lateral cell contact (<a href=\"#bib26\">Panfilio, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Panfilio and Roth, 2010</a>), but katatrepsis was lost at the base of the holometabolous insect radiation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Panfilio, 2008</a>). The longitudinal rotation of the young <i>Tribolium</i> germband embryo and amnion is akin to the more extensive movements of these tissues within the yolk in hemimetabolous insects (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cobben, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Rakshpal, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wheeler, 1889</a>). In contrast, the basal rather than lateral nature of reattachment in <i>Tribolium</i> represents a qualitatively different physical environment for the amnion during degeneration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Horn et al., 2015</a>). Consistent with this topographical change, we observe that whereas the morphogenetic properties of the serosa are conserved between <i>Tribolium</i> and the hemimetabolous bug <i>Oncopeltus</i>, the structure and mode of preparation for rupture in the amnion in these species are decidedly different. Further taxonomic sampling will reveal whether <i>Tribolium</i> represents the norm or one of multiple possible EE configurations within the Holometabola. Loss of katatrepsis in this insect lineage may have relaxed constraints on extraembryonic developmental strategies and permitted a degree of independence in the evolution of the insect amnion and serosa."

Using the MIP movie output, rupture initiation was determined as the interval between the following events. The start of rupture was recorded as either the first frame in which two or more cells clearly diverged, followed by the appearance of a hole in the EE tissue at the same position in subsequent frames, or as the first frame after a sudden collapse of the anterior EE membrane, whichever came first. The end of rupture was recorded as the first frame in which the retracting membrane cleared the head dorsally."

Novel insights are gained through the use of two different GFP transgenic lines, labeling the amnion and serosa, independently. As a previous reviewer has suggested, having a dual labeled (green/red) line would of course greatly aid their studies, but I understand as a non-canonical model system that the creation of this transgenic line is beyond the scope of this study, and the authors have done their due diligence using the two independent strains to the best of their ability, using a combination of structured illumination and light sheet imaging to resolve these morphogenetic events for the first time in live embryos. Thus, methodologically this represents a significant advance for their field. In terms of insights made in understanding the process at a cell biological level, the authors find striking differences between cell movements during rupturing in the two tissues, in timing, localization of the initial rupturing event, cell morphologies during rupturing, and coordination of the event itself. I am particularly intrigued by the stochastic nature of the event in the amnion, as the authors reported multiple cases of intracellular openings, as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D1-D2</a>. This was not observed in the serosa. Additionally, the serosa differs in its morphogenetic behavior, as rupture initiation seems more random. The authors use knockdown of two <i>zen</i> paralogs to demonstrate the functional importance of the serosa, as depletion of <i>Tc-zen1</i> by RNAi results in loss of enriched apical F-actin and a slowing of amnion dorsal withdrawal."

I think it will be critical to be able to visualize the basement membrane and functionally examine adhesion mechanisms in both epithelia going forward, but do not think those experiments fall within the scope of the current manuscript either."

Particularly, the new data presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> are compelling, and open up a fascinating new area of study (inter vs. intracellular rupturing in epithelia during morphogenesis). I am unaware of any other system where one might be able to examine this with live-cell imaging approaches, and think the inclusion of these data and the discussion in this version of the manuscript should make the paper of interest to a broader audience beyond the insect evo-devo and morphogenesis community, though I have a few recommendations of other papers that might be worth mentioning in the Discussion (see below).

Additionally, the absence of two-color imaging (and I appreciate that this is highly difficult with the current <i>Tribolium</i> technologies) makes it difficult to be 100% certain of some of the relationships reported between the amnion and serosa and how they evolve temporally. The work does provide important insights into <i>Tribolium</i> development, but it seems more appropriate for a specialty development journal."
