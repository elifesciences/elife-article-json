Here we report that ankyrin-B (AnkB), through integrating all three systems, functions as a critical node in the protein circuitry underlying polarized recycling of \u03b15\u03b21-integrin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which enables persistent fibroblast migration along fibronectin gradients. AnkB associates with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)-positive organelles in fibroblasts and binds dynactin to promote their long-range motility. We demonstrate that AnkB binds to Rab GTPase Activating Protein 1-Like (RabGAP1L) and recruits it to PI3P-positive organelles, where RabGAP1L inactivates Rab22A, and promotes polarized trafficking to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts. We further determine that \u03b15\u03b21-integrin depends on an AnkB/RabGAP1L complex for polarized recycling. Our results reveal AnkB as an unexpected key element in coordinating polarized transport of \u03b15\u03b21-integrin and likely of other specialized endocytic cargos."

Here we report that ankyrin-B (AnkB), through integrating all three systems, functions as a critical node in the protein circuitry underlying polarized recycling of \u03b15\u03b21-integrin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which enables persistent fibroblast migration along fibronectin gradients. AnkB associates with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)-positive organelles in fibroblasts and binds dynactin to promote their long-range motility. We demonstrate that AnkB binds to Rab GTPase Activating Protein 1-Like (RabGAP1L) and recruits it to PI3P-positive organelles, where RabGAP1L inactivates Rab22A, and promotes polarized trafficking to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts. We further determine that \u03b15\u03b21-integrin depends on an AnkB/RabGAP1L complex for polarized recycling. Our results reveal AnkB as an unexpected key element in coordinating polarized transport of \u03b15\u03b21-integrin and likely of other specialized endocytic cargos."

Steinman (later awarded a Nobel Prize for the discovery of dendritic cells) observed that a surface area equivalent to the entire plasma membrane was internalized every 2 hr in L-cells, which implied a rate of turnover for the bulk plasma membrane much faster than that of individual membrane proteins known at that time. His non-intuitive conclusion was that the majority of internalized membrane was returned to the cell surface in the form of small vesicles:"

One plausible mechanism is through scaffolding proteins capable of simultaneously recruiting and modulating the activity of motor and signaling complexes at endosomal membranes. For instance, the molecular scaffolds JNK interacting proteins 1 and 3 (JIP1 and JIP3) promote axonal transport through binding both protein kinases and the small G protein Arf6 on intracellular membranes. Moreover, JIP1 and JIP3 regulate kinesins directly and dynein indirectly through interaction with the dynactin complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fu and Holzbaur, 2013</a>). The kinesin motor Kif16B provides another example, which, through direct binding of both PI3P lipids and the small G protein Rab14, promotes the transport of FGFR2-endosomes to the fast-growing ends of microtubules during early embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hoepfner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Ueno et al., 2011</a>)."

AnkB promotes axonal transport and growth through coupling dynactin to organelles containing PI3P lipids (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lorenzo et al., 2014</a>). AnkB is broadly expressed, suggesting it may coordinate organelle transport in multiple cellular contexts. Here, we report that AnkB, through binding to PI3P lipids, dynactin, and the Rab GTPase-regulating protein RabGAP1L, functions as a master integrator of endosomal transport, which promotes polarized trafficking of PI3P-positive endosomes bearing \u03b15\u03b21-integrin to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts."

Therefore, we hypothesized that AnkB also contributes to the long-range transport of PI3P-positive organelles in other cell types. We selected primary cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) because these cells express 220 kDa AnkB (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and are a standard laboratory model that have been extensively studied with respect to organelle transport. We first examined the dynamics of AnkB-positive organelles by tracking the motility of vesicles expressing 220 kDa AnkB-mCherry in AnkB null (<i>Ank2<sup>-/-</sup></i>) MEFs isolated from postnatal day 0 (PND0) <i>Ank2<sup>-/-</sup> </i>mice (<a href=\"#bib56\">Scotland et al., 1998</a>). It is important to note that over-expression of 220 kDa AnkB is lethal for MEFs, and it was critical to express 220 kDa AnkB-mCherry in an AnkB null background. We observed that a subset of WT AnkB-mCherry-associated organelles exhibited fast long-range motility, with a net velocity greater than 4 \u00b5m/s and a persistence greater than 0.5, which is consistent with long-range, fast microtubule-based transport (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

To directly address the requirement of GAP activity of RabGAP1L in \u03b21-integrin recycling, we generated shRNA mediated RabGAP1L knock-down cells.

Moreover, we noticed that WT MEFs expressing Q64L Rab22A not only affected internalization of \u03b21-integrins, but also of transferrin and \u03b23-integrins, whose recycling is not affected in the loss of ankB (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>).

Considering that AnkB promotes \u03b15\u03b21-integrin recycling to the leading edge of migrating MEFs, we next investigated the possibility that AnkB loss impairs directional migration based on a linear fibronectin gradient. Using a microfluidic chamber system-based haptotaxis assay, we tracked the position of individual WT and <i>Ank2<sup>-/-</sup></i> MEFs migrating on a linear gradient of fibronectin during a 24 hr interval, which allowed\u00a0us to calculate the forward migration index (FMI), overall velocity, and persistence of motion (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wu et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Typically, fibroblasts haptotaxing on fibronectin gradients display an average FMI above 0.1, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) above 0. In contrast, a FMI of 0 with 95% CI crossing 0 is considered as not haptotaxing (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wu et al., 2012</a>). While WT MEFs, similar to control IA32 fibroblasts, exhibited haptotaxis towards higher concentrations of fibronectin, <i>Ank2<sup>-/-</sup></i> MEFs migrated in a random pattern (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Interestingly, <i>Ank2<sup>-/-</sup></i> MEFs exhibited no difference in the overall velocity or persistence of the cell migration, suggesting that the cell motility machinery is fully functional in the absence of AnkB (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). The finding that AnkB is required for recycling of \u03b15\u03b21-integrin, but not of \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin, is consistent with reports that fibroblasts rely primarily on \u03b21-integrins for establishing fibronectin haptotaxis (<a href=\"#bib40\">King et al., 2016</a>)."

We demonstrate that in fibroblasts AnkB functions as a PI3P effector associated with early endosomes, and describe a new interaction of AnkB with RabGAP1L. Moreover, we show that AnkB recruits RabGAP1L to PI3P-positive organelles, where it inactivates Rab22A, and identify \u03b15\u03b21-integrin as a specialized cargo that depends on AnkB/RabGAP1L for efficient recycling to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

Human AnkB, RabGAP1L, and Rab22A all have homologues in ghost sharks and zebrafish with a high level of sequence similarity, including nearly complete conservation of their AnkB-RabGAP1L binding sites. In contrast, residues required for interaction between AnkB and RabGAP1L are highly divergent in the closest homologues of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>C. elegans</i>. Human AnkB and its paralogue AnkG exhibit over 70% sequence conservation, with only a few localized regions of divergence. One highly divergent site between these two ankyrins is an unstructured peptide connecting the MBD and the first ZU5 domain, which through intramolecular inhibition, prevents interactions between AnkB and membrane partners (<a href=\"#bib31\">He et al., 2013</a>). Here, we identify an additional divergent site within AnkB\u2019s DD that allows AnkB, but not AnkG, to bind to RabGAP1L. AnkB, likely gained RabGAP1L-binding activity after divergence of AnkB and AnkG proteins in early vertebrate evolution, although, alternatively, AnkG may have lost this function. Similarly, RabGAP1L differs from its paralogue RabGAP1 primarily in the C-terminal residues required to bind AnkB."

Alternatively, conversion of Rab22A to its GDP form through the AnkB-mediated recruitment of RabGAP1L would be expected to reduce Rab5 activation, thus promoting loss of early endosome identity. Another possibility is that RabGAP1L perform functions independent of GAP-activity, similar to p120RasGAP, which competes with, instead of inactivating, Rab21in binding to integrin \u03b1 cytoplasmic tails to promote integrin recycling (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mai et al., 2011</a>).

Inserts were removed 48 hr post-plating to allow cell migration towards the exposed region. Migrating cells at the edges of the dish were selected for photoconversion and imaged by time-lapse video microscopy. In brief, the perinuclear region of mMaple3-expressing cells was stimulated with blue light (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a0405 nm) to convert mMaple3 particles from green to red fluorescence. Photoconverted cells were continuously imaged for 16 min (1frame/15 s, 64 frames). The fluorescent intensity (FI) of red and green particles within the perinuclear region was determined using the Volocity software (Perkin Elmers, Waltham, MA). Retrograde transport of non-converted mMaple3-tagged vesicles towards the perinuclear region, expressed as percentage of green fluorescent gain, was calculated as: [FI at 16\u00a0min \u2013 FI at 45 s (post-conversion time))/ (FI at 0 s \u2013 intensity at 45 s)]. The anterograde transport of mMaple3-tagged vesicles was expressed as percentage of red fluorescent loss and calculated as [(intensity at 45 s\u2013 intensity at 16\u00a0min)/ (intensity at 45 s \u2013 intensity at 0 s)].

They first showed that AnkB mediates not only axonal trafficking in neurons as reported previously but also long-range transport of PI3P-containing organelles such as early endosomes and lysosomes in non-neuronal cells. In migrating fibroblasts, \u03b15\u03b21 integrin was found to be one of the important cargos of this trafficking pathway and was recycled in a polarized manner during persistent cell migration. To investigate the mechanism of how AnkB functions, the authors identified RabGAP1L, a GAP for Rab22A, as a novel binding partner of AnkB. From structural and evolutionary perspectives, they carefully determined critical residues for the interaction between AnkB and RabGAP1L. Finally, they showed that the interactions of AnkB with RabGAP1L, PI3P, and in part dynactin are required for polarized recycling of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin in migrating fibroblasts by a yet undefined mechanisms of cargo recruitment. There are also some data suggesting that AnkB may contribute to haptotaxis toward the \u03b15\u03b21 integrin ligand, fibronectin."

If one demonstrates (as they have) a greater number of vesicles leaving the front portion of the perinuclear region and proceeding toward the cell front than to the back, this is good, but it's not evidence to support Bretscher's postulate that integrins are disengaged from the substratum and the cell rear and then moved to the front in vesicles. As the paper currently stands, it reads a little like their evidence does support such a process.</i> "

                    "text": "We regret confusion caused by term \"polarized delivery of \u03b15-integrin\". To clarify, we are specifically looking at the transport of perinuclear \u03b15-integrins either to the front or rear of migrating cells. We do not intend to make any claim in regards to the origin of these integrins, regardless of whether they are internalized from the cell rear or the cell front. To make it clear to readers, we specifically changed \"polarized transport/delivery of \u03b15-integrins\" to \"polarized transport/delivery of perinuclear \u03b15-integrins\" in the text. Regarding a detailed discussion of Mark Bretscher\u2019s model, we make a single reference to his 1989 and 1992 papers, which were written before contributions of Rabs were understood. We changed \"polarized delivery\" to \"polarized delivery from cytoplasmic compartments to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts\" in the subsection \u201cIdentification of \u03b15\u03b21-integrin as an AnkB/RabGAP1L-dependent cargo\u201d, where we cited his papers. His finding (Bretscher, 1989) actually stated internalization occurred all over the cell and did not specify a particular location: \"[\u2026] This directed flow is produced by the endocytosis of lipids plus receptors randomly over the cell surface combined with their return to the cell surface at the leading edge [\u2026] the fibronectin receptor follows a similar course to other circulating receptors\". We acknowledge that recent studies utilizing the photoactivation strategy (Zech et al., 2011; Dozynkiewicz et al., 2012) revealed that the situation of integrin trafficking/recycling is much more complex than the initial Brescher's model and feel that a detailed discussion of all of the subsequent papers on this topic is more appropriate for a review focused on integrins, which we cite (Caswell et al., 2009; Bridgewater et al., 2012; Arjonen et al., 2012; De Franceschi et al., 2015)."
