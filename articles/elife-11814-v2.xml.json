However, parent and offspring are in conflict over how much parents should invest in their young where offspring typically demand more than is optimal for the parent (<a href=\"#bib37\">Trivers, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Godfray, 1995</a>), and the existence of this genetic conflict has been demonstrated in empirical research (<a href=\"#bib26\">K\u00f6lliker et al., 2015</a>). The resulting selection pressures are predicted to lead to the evolution of traits in offspring that influence parental behaviour (and thus investment). Conversely, parental traits should be selected for their effects on offspring traits that influence parental behaviour indirectly (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kilner and Hinde, 2012</a>). The correlation between parental and offspring traits has been the focus of coadaptation models where specific combinations of demand and provisioning are selectively favoured (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wolf and Brodie III, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">K\u00f6lliker et al., 2005</a>). The fundamental assumption underlying predictions about the evolution of traits involved in parent-offspring interactions is that genetic variation in offspring exists for traits that indirectly influence maternal investment and vice versa. However, it remains to be shown whether specific genetic variants in offspring indirectly influence maternal behaviour. In an experimental mouse population, we demonstrate that genes expressed in offspring modify the quality of maternal behaviour and thus affect, indirectly, offspring fitness."

We generated families of genetically variable mothers and genetically uniform offspring by cross-fostering C57BL/6J (B6) litters, in which no genetic variation occurs between animals of this strain, to mothers of a given BXD strain. Conversely, a BXD female\u2019s litter was cross-fostered to B6 mothers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Thus, we can analyse the effects of genetic variation in mothers or offspring while controlling for genetic variation in the other. This cross-fostering design has been successfully utilized in previous studies on family interactions because it breaks the correlation between maternal and offspring traits. Here, different families, or naturally occurring variation of maternal and offspring trait combinations across different broods, are assumed to represent distinct evolved strategies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agrawal et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hager and Johnstone, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Meunier and K\u00f6lliker, 2012</a>).

                        "text": "We first investigated whether there is evidence for indirect genetic effects in offspring influencing maternal behaviour, keeping maternal genotype constant. To find out if maternal behaviour is modified by genes expressed in offspring, we mapped variation in maternal behaviour as a function of their adoptive BXD offspring genotype. We found that variation in offspring genotype affects maternal behaviour, which in turn influences offspring development and fitness. Throughout, we denote loci as either maternal or offspring, <i>Mat</i> or <i>Osp</i>, followed by whether it is an indirect effect (<i>Ige</i>) or a direct effect locus (<i>Dge</i>). We provide a summary of all loci in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, and mapping details in <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary files 1A-D</a>. During the first postnatal week we mapped a locus on offspring chromosome 7, <i>OspIge7.1</i>, modifying maternal nestbuidling on day 6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). At this locus, the D2 allele increases the trait value such that B6 mothers showed more nestbuilding activity when fostering BXD pups carrying the D2 allele at the locus. Nestbuilding is particularly important for offspring fitness as thermoregulation is underdeveloped and hypothermia\u00a0is the primary cause of early death, even if milk is supplied (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lynch and Possidente, 1978</a>). We detected a further locus on offspring distal chromosome 5 (<i>OspIge5.1</i>) that affects maternal behaviour on day 14, around the time we expect the weaning conflict to be highest (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Here, mothers showed increased levels of maternal behaviour when fostering BXD offspring carrying the D2 allele. Conversely, we can look at how variation in maternal genotype influences offspring traits, keeping offspring genotype constant, mapping variation in offspring traits as a function of BXD genotype. Here, we found that offspring growth during the second week is affected by a locus on maternal chromosome 17, <i>MatIge17.1,</i> where the B6 allele increases the trait value (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In addition to looking at indirect genetic effects we can analyse direct genetic effects, i.e. how an individual\u2019s genotype influences its own traits. In mothers we found a direct genetic effect locus for maternal behaviour on proximal chromosome 10, and for nestbuilding behaviour on chromosome 1 (<i>MatDge10.1</i> and <i>MatDge1.1</i>, respectively), where the B6 allele increases the trait value in both cases. We also detected a locus for offspring solicitation behaviour on chromosome 5 (<i>OspDge5.1</i>) with the D2 allele increasing the level of solicitation shown. Its location is at the opposite end on chromosome 5 from where <i>OspIge5.1</i> is located."

Importantly, our result that variation in maternal behaviour is affected by genes expressed in offspring is also clearly borne out at the phenotypic level: offspring solicitation behaviour in genetically variable BXD pups is positively correlated with the level of maternal behaviour in their genetically uniform B6 adoptive mothers on all three days we measured behaviour with significant effects of maternal behaviour and day on offspring solicitation (GLM, <i>F</i><sub>1,103</sub> = 17.62, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 and <i>F</i><sub>2,103</sub> = 14.22, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively; day 6: Pearsons\u2019<i>r</i> = 0.56, <i>P</i> = 0.003; day 10: <i>r</i> = 0.63, <i>P</i> = 0.001, and day 14: <i>r</i> = 0.55, <i>P</i> = 0.008; <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 2, a</a>). Similarly, we can investigate how traits in genetically uniform B6 offspring correlate with maternal traits in their genetically variable BXD mothers (i.e. within adoptive families). We found that maternal behaviour and day have a significant positive effect on offspring solicitation behaviour (GLM, <i>F</i><sub>1,118</sub> = 6.33, <i>P</i> = 0.013, and <i>F</i><sub>2,118</sub> = 6.33, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 2, b</a>). While one might generally assume that mothers behave in response to offspring solicitation behaviour, these results show, perhaps surprisingly, that variation in maternal behaviour influences the level of solicitation: here, we need to remember that there is no variation in offspring genotype so we assume that across families differences in offspring behaviour are due to differences in the genotype of their adoptive mothers."

This correlation has been analysed in coadaptation models, which make specific predictions about how parental and offspring traits are correlated, and in empirical work (<a href=\"#bib24\">K\u00f6lliker et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agrawal et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Curley et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lock et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">K\u00f6lliker et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hinde et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Meunier and K\u00f6lliker, 2012</a>). Prior experimental studies have found both a positive (<i>Parus major;</i> <a href=\"#bib24\">K\u00f6lliker et al., 2000</a>: <i>Nicrophorus vespilloides;</i> <a href=\"#bib27\">Lock et al., 2004</a>) and negative correlation between offspring solicitation and parental traits (<i>Sehirus cinctus;</i> <a href=\"#bib1\">Agrawal et al., 2001</a>). In our study, we found a negative correlation. When we measured short-term provisioning, we found a negative correlation between BXD offspring short-term weight gain and the corresponding provisioning of their biological (BXD) mothers on day 10, as well as a negative correlation between BXD offspring solicitation and the corresponding provisioning of their biological (BXD) mothers on day 14 (GLM, <i>F</i><sub>1,32</sub> = 4.77, <i>P</i> = 0.036; <i>r</i> = -0.34 and GLM, <i>F</i><sub>1,28</sub> = 8.046, <i>P</i> = 0.008, <i>r</i> = -0.48; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 2, d</a>). Thus, our results suggest that mothers who are generous providers produce young that solicit less maternal resources than offspring born to less generous mothers. Such a negative correlation is predicted to occur when maternal traits are predominantly under selection as long as parents respond to offspring demand (which we have shown above; <a href=\"#bib25\">K\u00f6lliker et al., 2005</a>). One scenario to explain this negative correlation might be that each BXD line, i.e. genotype, is characterized by a unique (to this line, everything else being equal) combination of offspring and maternal behaviours where higher maternal provisioning is correlated with lower offspring solicitation. This may be due to the cost of increased solicitation (reflected in reduced bodyweight for the effort expended) for which we found evidence in our study. Bodyweight is indeed negatively correlated with the level of offspring solicitation (GLM, <i>F</i><sub>1,66</sub> = 20.57, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 e.g. day 10, <i>r</i> = -0.39, and day 14, <i>r</i> = -0.44; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 2, e</a>)."

At the same time, we detected specific loci in maternal genotype that indirectly modify offspring traits, which shows that IGEs can be an important component of the genetic architecture of complex traits (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bijma and Wade, 2008</a>). We note that while postnatal cross-fostering controls for postnatal maternal effects, prenatal maternal effects can only be addressed (to some degree) by embryo transfer (e.g. <a href=\"#bib9\">Cowley et al., 1989</a>), a procedure that is impractical in genetics experiments. Potentially, this may strengthen or weaken, for example, effects of BXD genotype on B6 maternal phenotype. At the same time, pre-natal maternal effects may also contribute to a phenotypic correlation between parent and biological offspring traits, as reported above on coadaptation. In-utero effect variation due to differences in BXD genotype may therefore contribute to differences in BXD offspring behaviour, in turn affecting the behaviour of their adoptive mothers. We now need to investigate the candidates identified here and how their effects on parental and offspring traits are integrated into the gene networks determining individual development. By controlling for genetic variation in either mothers or offspring we have been able to show that levels of maternal provisioning and offspring solicitation are unique to specific genotypes (here each BXD line) and that solicitation is costly. The ability to conduct complex systems genetics analyses in experimental systems of parent offspring interactions will enable us to concentrate now on understanding the underlying pathways involved, and how they are modified by social environmental conditions that determine adult phenotypes and associated reproductive success."

Williams at the University of Tennessee Health Science Centre, Memphis, TN. C57BL/6J (B6) mice were obtained from Charles River, UK. Three within-line repeats plus the corresponding 42 B6 families with three within-line repeats were set up for the experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Sample size was determined considering power analyses and logistical aspects. Mapping power is maximised with increasing number of lines whereas within-line repeats <i>n</i> increase confidence of line average phenotypes, which, however, rapidly diminishes as <i>n</i> exceeds four (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belknap, 1998</a>). We have modelled power and effect sizes following (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belknap, 1998</a>): n = (Z<sub>\u03b1</sub> + Z<sub>\u03b2</sub>)2 / S<sup>2</sup>QTL / S<sup>2</sup>Res). Z<sub>\u03b1</sub> and Z<sub>\u03b2</sub> are Z values for a given \u03b1 and \u03b2; S<sup>2</sup>QTL is the phenotypic variance due to a QTL and S<sup>2</sup>Res is the residual variance. With power (1-\u03b2) of 80%, \u03b1 of 0.05 we estimated that with 45 lines we can detect QTL at genome-wide significance explaining ~ 16% of trait variance, which is sufficient mapping power given effect sizes of prior work. We have modelled the relationship between power and number of replicates using qtlDesign (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sen et al., 2007</a>). Everything else being equal power can be optimized by maximizing the number of genotypes (i.e. lines) and reducing replicates, even with varying degrees of heritability. Thus, we set up three replicates using 45 lines, and line averages are mapped, although for some traits and some lines this number may be lower due to lower breeding success. Outliers have been retained as they represent distinct genotypes, evinced by outliers for different traits being from the same line. Interval mapping (<a href=\"#bib19\">Haley and Knott, 1992</a>) relies on 3795 informative SNP markers across all chromosomes, except Y, as implemented in GeneNetwork (GN) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hager et al., 2012</a>). The BXD strains were genotyped using the MUGA array in 2011, along with genotypes generated earlier using Affymetrix and Illumina platforms (<a href=\"#bib35\">Shifman et al., 2006</a>), and mm9 is used. Loci are identified in GN by the computation of a likelihood statistic score and significance was determined using 2000 permutations of the phenotype data. Candidates were identified within the region defined by using GeneNetwork (<a href=\"http://www.genenetwork.org\">http://www.genenetwork.org</a>) and further information combined from QTLminer (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alberts and Schughart, 2010</a>), Entrez genes (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene</a>) and Mouse Genome Informatics (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eppig et al., 2015</a>)."

Both mothers and litters were weighed at birth and once weekly, for three weeks until weaning, i.e. at the end of week 1, week 2 and week 3, respectively, to enable the calculation of growth during these periods. In addition, we recorded maternal and offspring behaviour on postnatal days 6, 10 and 14 when we simulated maternal departure to standardize observation conditions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hager and Johnstone, 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2005</a>). After a 4h separation, mother and litter were re-joined and maternal and offspring behaviours recorded simultaneously over 15 min, using scan sampling every 20 s (<a href=\"#bib30\">Martin and Bateson, 2007</a>). Provisioning is measured using an established protocol (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hager and Johnstone, 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">2007</a>) as maternal and offspring weight change after reunification with pups over the following two hours. Because rodents are nocturnal all observations occurred under red light, i.e. the active phase. Maternal behaviour was recorded as the sum of nursing, suckling and nest building. Nursing is defined as attending the litter, sitting on the nest and suckling up to half the litter while suckling refers to the entire litter being suckled at the same time. This distinction was used as sometimes it cannot be ascertained whether pups are suckling or not because of the position of the mothers in the nest. Nestbuilding behaviour is gathering nesting material and constructing a nest. Pup solicitation behaviour in mice is defined as pups attempting to suck and following the mother, but individual pups were not distinguished. All procedures were approved by the University of Manchester Ethics Committee."

We did not record individual pup behaviour (where cage effects may appear) but rather for the entire litter and the per pup measure divides the score by litter size. This is because mothers may differ e.g. in their provisioning not because they have different genotypes but simply because they nurse litters of different sizes. Using linear models we found significant litter size effects. Thus, using a per pup measure is fully justified and appropriate, as well as supported by statistics, and we have used the correct litter size to calculate per pup measures, namely adoptive litter size. We have clarified this in the Methods section now. All our analyses are conduced within Genenetwork, the analytical tool kit for the BXD population (www.genenetwork.org) used in over 1000 papers, which at present does not allow running models with covariates but we understand this will be implemented in future."

Prior to the experiment on the day we have no information about whether mothers have just been nursing their pups or whether the last bout of nursing was several hours ago. Thus, we might see a difference in the pups\u2019 motivation to suck, and in the mothers to nurse, not because of differences in genotypes but because of differences in the times that elapsed between the last feed.

Further, our result that variation in maternal behaviour is affected by genes expressed in offspring is supported by phenotypic results: offspring solicitation behaviour in genetically variable BXD pups is positively correlated with the level of maternal behaviour in their genetically uniform B6 adoptive mothers on all three days we measured behaviour with significant effects of maternal behaviour and day on offspring solicitation. We appreciate the point the reviewer is making regarding an overlap of DGE QTL and IGE QTL, but no direct support is provided and we have no reason to assume that DGE QTL and IGE QTL have to overlap to support this argument."
