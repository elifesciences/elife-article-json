These particles then join together\u2014like beads on a string\u2014to form a highly periodic structure called chromatin. In the nucleus, chromatin is further folded and condensed into chromosomes. However, many important processes, including the replication of DNA and the transcription of genes, require access to the DNA. The cell must therefore be able to disassemble chromatin and remove the histones, and then, once these processes are complete, to reassemble the chromatin. Enzymes known as chromatin assembly factors are responsible for the disassembly and reassembly of chromatin."

(<a href=\"#bib15\">Glikin et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ruberti and Worcel, 1986</a>). Nucleosome assembly is facilitated by the combined activities of ATP-dependent motor proteins (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib17\">Haushalter and Kadonaga, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lusser and Kadonaga, 2004</a>) and histone chaperones (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib7\">Corpet and Almouzni, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Campos and Reinberg, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Das et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ransom et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Avvakumov et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Els\u00e4sser and D\u2019Arcy, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Burgess and Zhang, 2013</a>). Histone chaperones initially deposit core histones onto DNA to form non-nucleosomal histone\u2013DNA intermediates (prenucleosomes), which can then be converted into periodic arrays of canonical nucleosomes by ATP-driven motor proteins (<a href=\"#bib34\">Torigoe et al., 2011</a>)."

These motor proteins exhibit both chromatin assembly and remodeling activities, and are members of the SNF2 (sucrose non-fermenting 2) protein family, which comprises the ATPases that are known to be involved in chromatin remodeling (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib6\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Flaus and Owen-Hughes, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hargreaves and Crabtree, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ryan and Owen-Hughes, 2011</a>). With the Chd1, ACF, and ToRC motor proteins, it has been shown that efficient chromatin assembly requires both a histone chaperone (such as NAP1) and the motor protein (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ito et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lusser et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Emelyanov et al., 2012</a>). Hence, the Chd1, ACF, and ToRC motor proteins are not able to catalyze chromatin assembly in the absence of a histone chaperone. To determine whether nucleosome assembly requires the ability to reposition nucleosomes, we examined the properties of mutant Chd1 proteins that are defective for chromatin remodeling activity yet retain a substantial amount of their ATPase activity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Patel et al., 2011</a>). These studies have enabled us to identify functionally distinct roles of chromatin assembly and remodeling in the formation of periodic nucleosome arrays."

These chromatin remodeling-defective yChd1 proteins contain either a deletion of residues 932\u2013940 (\u0394932\u2013940) or a Trp<sup>932</sup> to Ala substitution (W932A; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The \u0394932\u2013940 and W932A mutations of yChd1 block its ability to couple ATPase activity to nucleosome remodeling/sliding, but still allow for robust ATPase activity. In contrast, deletions of more C-terminal regions of yChd1 (ranging from residues 939\u20131010) cause the near complete loss of the ATPase activity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Patel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ryan et al., 2011</a>).

Chromatin assembly requires both the Chd1 motor protein as well as the NAP1 histone chaperone (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lusser et al., 2005</a>). The extent of nucleosome assembly was monitored by the DNA supercoiling assay, in which the change in the linking number of DNA that occurs upon formation of nucleosomes in the presence of topoisomerase I is observed (<a href=\"#bib14\">Germond et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Simpson et al., 1985</a>).

We therefore examined whether or not the species formed in the absence of ATP contained canonical nucleosomes by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of the MNase digestion products (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In this assay, we observed ATP-dependent stimulation of the formation of core particles by wild-type as well as mutant yChd1 proteins.

It remained formally possible, however, that chromatin remodeling is sufficient for chromatin assembly. To test this notion, we carried out parallel chromatin remodeling and assembly reactions with purified yChd1 (as a positive control/reference) and purified human Brg1 (hBrg1; also known as SMARCA4), which is a SNF2-like family ATPase found in human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib6\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Flaus and Owen-Hughes, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hargreaves and Crabtree, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ryan and Owen-Hughes, 2011</a>). The purified hBrg1 protein is active for chromatin remodeling (e.g., <a href=\"#bib26\">Phelan et al., 1999</a>). By using the restriction enzyme accessibility assay for chromatin remodeling (e.g., as in <a href=\"#bib35\">Varga-Weisz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Boyer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Shen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alexiadis and Kadonaga, 2002</a>), we found that remodeling activity of yChd1 was comparable to that of hBrg1 over a range of concentrations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We then performed chromatin assembly reactions with the same concentrations of factors, and found that hBrg1 did not assemble chromatin under conditions in which efficient chromatin assembly was observed with the yChd1 control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Moreover, the hBrg1 caused a decrease in the supercoiling of DNA, which may be related to the nucleosome disruption activity of the SWI/SNF complex (e.g., <a href=\"#bib20\">Kwon et al., 1994</a>). These results thus show that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling does not necessarily result in the formation of nucleosomes from histones, histone chaperone (NAP1), DNA, and ATP."

First, an ATP-driven chromatin assembly activity generates randomly-distributed nucleosomes from histones, histone chaperone(s), and DNA, probably via a prenucleosome intermediate (<a href=\"#bib34\">Torigoe et al., 2011</a>). Then, the randomly-distributed nucleosomes are converted into periodic nucleosome arrays via an ATP-driven nucleosome spacing (remodeling) activity. Although we depict the two processes separately, they may occur concurrently with wild-type Chd1. The basis for the formation of periodic nucleosomes as the final product of chromatin assembly is not known, but it is possible that attractive forces between nucleosomes are maximized when the nucleosomes are arranged and/or compacted in a periodic array. In addition, the internucleosomal spacing may be influenced by the interaction of the factors with DNA."

In addition, the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein, human Brg1, does not assemble nucleosomes. We further examined the ability of the chromatin remodeling-defective Chd1 proteins to function in the assembly of periodic nucleosome arrays. The results suggest a process (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) in which randomly-distributed canonical nucleosomes are generated by the nucleosome assembly function of Chd1 and are then converted into regularly-spaced nucleosome arrays by the chromatin remodeling/spacing/sliding activity of Chd1.

Two liters of bacterial culture were grown at 37\u00b0C to A<sub>600</sub> \u223c0.5\u20130.6 and induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. The cells were incubated at 17\u00b0C for 18 hr, harvested, and sonicated in Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 500 mM NaCl, 10% [vol/vol] glycerol, 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM benzamidine, and 0.2 mM PMSF) containing 10 mM imidazole. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (20 min; 45,000\u00d7<i>g</i>; 4\u00b0C) and mixed with 3 ml Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). After incubation on a rotating wheel for 3 hr at 4\u00b0C, the resin was loaded into a disposable 20-ml polypropylene column and washed with 30 column volumes of Buffer A containing 10 mM imidazole. His-tagged Chd1 was then eluted with 10 ml of Buffer A containing 300 mM imidazole. Following concentration with an Amicon Ultra-15 (30 kDa nominal molecular weight limit) Centrifugal Filter Unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA), Chd1 was applied to a Superdex 200 prep grade (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) size exclusion column ([column volume, 120 ml]; column dimensions [diameter \u00d7 length], 1.6 cm \u00d7 60 cm; flow rate, 1.0 ml/min) and eluted with 1.5 column volumes of Buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% [vol/vol] glycerol, 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM benzamidine, and 0.2 mM PMSF) containing 300 mM NaCl. The peak fractions were analyzed by polyacrylamide-SDS gel electrophoresis, pooled, and dialyzed against Buffer B containing 100 mM NaCl. The resulting sample was applied to a Source 15S (GE Healthcare) cation exchange column ([column volume, 1.0 ml]; column dimensions [diameter \u00d7 length], 0.5 cm \u00d7 5 cm; flow rate, 1.0 ml/min). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of 100 mM NaCl in Buffer B, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient (12 column volumes) from 100 mM to 1 M NaCl in Buffer B. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer B containing 50 mM NaCl."

The buffer composition of the final reaction mixture was as follows: 15 mM Hepes (K<sup>+</sup>), pH 7.6, 3 mM Tris, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl, 5.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EDTA, 6.6% (vol/vol) glycerol, 1% (wt/vol) polyvinyl alcohol (average MW 10,000), 1% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 20 \u00b5g/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction products were analyzed by DNA supercoiling and partial MNase digestion assays (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fyodorov and Kadonaga, 2003</a>) as well as by extensive MNase digestion of the reaction products followed by agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA fragments (e.g., <a href=\"#bib34\">Torigoe et al., 2011</a>) or native nucleoprotein gel electrophoresis of chromatin particles (<a href=\"#bib36\">Varshavsky et al., 1976</a>). The percent supercoiling ([amount of supercoiled DNA/amount of total DNA species] \u00d7 100%) in the DNA supercoiling assays was quantified with ImageQuantTL (GE Healthcare). Because it is not possible to ascertain the fraction of nicked DNA that is packaged into chromatin, we included the nicked DNA in the \u2018amount of total DNA species\u2019 but not in the \u2018amount of supercoiled DNA\u2019. Therefore, \u2018percent supercoiling\u2019 reflects the amount of closed circular plasmid DNA that is packaged into chromatin and does not include the nicked DNA that is packaged into chromatin."

We found that wild-type Chd1 does not exhibit chromatin assembly activity without NAP1, even in the presence of ATP. We can repeat the same experiments with the mutant Chd1 proteins in the absence vs. presence of NAP1 and ATP, if desired. Given, however, that the wild-type protein lacks any detectable chromatin assembly activity in the absence of NAP1, it does seem unlikely that the mutant proteins will somehow have gained this activity.

Even within a single 2D gel there can be some variations due to the relatively long distances the DNA samples travel in two different dimensions. In other words, it just doesn't seem realistic or feasible to run all of the supercoiling samples on 2D gels. In our experience, we can generate the most consistent and reliable data for the comparison of a series of multiple samples with 1D gels. If our experiments had involved the quantitative analysis of two or three samples, we would have used 2D gels as we have in the past. In other words, while 2D gels can provide information on the relative amounts of differently supercoiled species of a plasmid, we do not recommend their use in the comparative analysis of a series of samples."
