Implicit in much of this work is the notion that tonic activation and inactivation will both produce valid, internally consistent insights into interneurons\u2019 computational roles. Here, using single-unit recordings in auditory cortex of awake mice, we show that this may not generally hold true. Optogenetically manipulating somatostatin-positive (Sst+) or parvalbumin-positive (Pvalb+) interneurons while recording tone-responses showed that Sst+ inactivation increased response gain, while Pvalb+ inactivation weakened tuning and decreased information transfer, implying that these neurons support delineable computational functions. But activating Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons revealed no such differences. We used a simple network model to understand this asymmetry, and showed how relatively small changes in key parameters, such as spontaneous activity or strength of the light manipulation, determined whether activation and inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions regarding interneurons\u2019 computational functions."

Implicit in much of this work is the notion that tonic activation and inactivation will both produce valid, internally consistent insights into interneurons\u2019 computational roles. Here, using single-unit recordings in auditory cortex of awake mice, we show that this may not generally hold true. Optogenetically manipulating somatostatin-positive (Sst+) or parvalbumin-positive (Pvalb+) interneurons while recording tone-responses showed that Sst+ inactivation increased response gain, while Pvalb+ inactivation weakened tuning and decreased information transfer, implying that these neurons support delineable computational functions. But activating Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons revealed no such differences. We used a simple network model to understand this asymmetry, and showed how relatively small changes in key parameters, such as spontaneous activity or strength of the light manipulation, determined whether activation and inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions regarding interneurons\u2019 computational functions."

However, isolating each subtype to causally determine its contributions to cortical processing has been hindered by the limited repertoire of techniques available. Recent advances in molecular techniques, such as optogenetics (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boyden et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>), chemogenetics (<a href=\"#bib5\">Armbruster et al., 2007</a>), and more recently magnetogenetics (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wheeler et al., 2016</a>), have transcended traditional methods of probing cell function, enabling reversible and selective activation or inactivation of interneuron firing in vivo. These tools have been used extensively to identify the particular functions each interneuron subtype serves within the cortex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adesnik et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aizenberg et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Atallah et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cardin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cottam et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Natan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Seybold et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sohal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wilson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Xu et al., 2013</a>). An implicit assumption underlying much of this work is that one can directly read out a cell type\u2019s function, and infer its specialized operations, by tonically modulating its firing down or up: in other words, that the response features or computations weakened by inactivating a cell population are specifically those that the cell population normally supports, that these features will be strengthened when the same population is activated, and that the natural differences in cortical function between cell populations may be read out, and interpreted, using these same strategies."

Here, in line with the broader goal of establishing the ways in which we can use causal strategies to gain insight into interneuron function, we tested this assumption by manipulating either of the two main families of cortical interneurons \u2013 somatostatin-positive (Sst+) or parvalbumin-positive (Pvalb+) interneurons \u2013 while recording neural responses to tones in the auditory cortex of awake mice. We found that inactivation of Sst+ interneurons increased response gain, while inactivation of Pvalb+ interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer, implying that these two neuron types support specific, separable functions in the auditory cortex. Yet activating Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons revealed no such differences. We used a simple feedforward model to understand this asymmetry, and found that relatively small changes in key parameters, such as baseline activity, neural thresholds, or the strength of the light manipulation, determined whether activation and inactivation would produce internally consistent conclusions regarding interneurons\u2019 computational functions. This implies that seemingly minor experimental details can qualitatively change the readout of a neural population\u2019s role in computation, and that the conclusions we draw regarding neuronal function can be influenced, even distorted, by the precise way in which the neuronal populations are manipulated."

We calculated these components by fitting a straight line to the average firing rates on trials with (green) versus without (black) altered inhibition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). In the context of optogenetically manipulating interneurons in the auditory cortex, comparing a neuron\u2019s FTC in the light-on versus light-off conditions would be expected to reveal whether the change in firing in that neuron is well fit by such a model, and, if so, whether and to what extent the transformation is multiplicative/divisive (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), additive/subtractive (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>), or a combination (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). The slope of the best-fit line, if significantly different from unity, reveals the magnitude of the multiplicative/divisive component of the transformation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), while the y-intercept of the best-fit line, if significantly different from zero, reveals the magnitude and significance of the additive/subtractive component (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). Within this framework, a neuron\u2019s FTC may undergo eight possible types of linear transformations (e.g. significantly divisive but not significantly additive/subtractive, significantly divisive and significantly subtractive, significantly subtractive but not significantly multiplicative/divisive, and so on; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>); alternatively, neither the scaling nor shifting components may be significant at all."

We applied the linear regression described above to the 44 units recorded from Arch/Sst and 41 units from Arch/Pvalb mice whose responses were tuned for frequency and significantly increased by light (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). This included both narrow-spiking and broad-spiking units (defined by a trough-to-peak duration of less than or greater than 450 \u03bcs, respectively; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Most units showed predominantly linear changes in their FTC with decreased inhibition (Arch/Sst: median R<sup>2</sup> = 0.81; Arch/Pvalb: median R<sup>2</sup> = 0.78; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Inactivation of Sst+ cells produced a variety of linear transformations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, pink examples), as did inactivation of Pvalb+ cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, light blue examples). However, the proportions of linear transformation types produced by inactivation of Sst+ cells were significantly different from those produced by inactivation of Pvalb+ cells (Fisher\u2019s exact test p=0.0015; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). To quantitatively compare the effects of inactivating Sst+ or Pvalb+ cells on response gain (i.e., the magnitude of the multiplicative component), we compared the distributions of the slope values obtained from the linear regression analyses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>) and found that inactivating Sst+ cells had a significantly larger effect on the response gain than inactivating Pvalb+ cells (rank-sum p=0.01). Furthermore, inactivating Pvalb+ cells had a significantly larger effect on the magnitude of the additive component compared to inactivating Sst+ cells (rank-sum p=1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22124</sup>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). These differences between the effects of inactivating Sst+ versus Pvalb+ cells were more prominent among broad-spiking units than narrow-spiking units (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Interestingly, this larger additive effect produced by inactivating Pvalb+ cells was not entirely due to increases in spontaneous activity, as performing linear regression on baseline-subtracted responses (defined as sound-evoked FR minus spontaneous FR; <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3a,b</a>) revealed similar differences in both the slopes and y-intercepts (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3c,d</a>), implying that the additive effect produced by inactivation of Pvalb+ cells must include a substantial contribution from sound-evoked responses that are not frequency selective."

Furthermore, the distributions of the slope values and the distributions of the y-intercept values obtained from the linear regression analyses were similar (slopes: rank-sum p=0.68; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>; y-intercepts: rank-sum p=0.77; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>), consistent with our previous work (<a href=\"#bib46\">Seybold et al., 2015</a>). These similarities were present among broad-spiking units as well as narrow-spiking units (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Performing linear regression on baseline-subtracted responses (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3a,b</a>) also revealed no differences (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3c,d</a>).

To account for potential differences in the distributions of FR suppression produced by activation of each interneuron population, we again matched the two unit populations by their FR ratios. The proportions of linear transformations produced by interneuron activation remained similar (Fisher\u2019s exact test p=0.42; <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5c</a>), as did the magnitudes of both the subtractive and divisive effects (slopes: rank-sum p=0.58; <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5d</a>; y-intercepts: rank-sum p=0.70; <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5e</a>).

These units had median spike trough-to-peak durations of 348 \u00b1 61 \u03bcs and 287 \u00b1 41 \u03bcs, respectively, were generally spontaneously active before the tone (putative Sst+: FR = 6.3 \u00b1 2.5\u2009Hz; putative Pvalb+: FR = 8.6 \u00b1 4.2\u2009Hz), and increased their firing during the tone (putative Sst+: FR = 12.2 \u00b1 8.5\u2009Hz; putative Pvalb+: FR = 24.8 \u00b1 12.7\u2009Hz). Interestingly, optogenetic activation of putative Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons had a larger effect on spontaneous FRs (putative Sst+: FR ratio = 3.9 \u00b1 2.9; putative Pvalb+: FR ratio = 2.5 \u00b1 0.8), than sound-evoked FRs (putative Sst+: FR ratio = 2.9 \u00b1 1.5; putative Pvalb+: FR ratio = 1.5 \u00b1 0.2). Moreover, even putative interneurons that were not generally active without light (sound-evoked rate of less than 5\u2009Hz; putative Sst+: n = 7 units; putative Pvalb+: n = 1 unit) often showed FRs well above 30\u2009Hz during the light (putative Sst+: evoked rate = 35.04 \u00b1 28.3\u2009Hz; putative Pvalb+: evoked rate = 54.5\u2009Hz). Together, these results suggest that activation increases the number of stimulus-independent spikes generated by both interneuron populations, potentially masking normal stimulus-driven function."

Synaptic inhibition can enhance the transfer of information regarding stimulus identity in multiple ways: for instance, rapidly fluctuating inhibition might improve information transfer by linearizing responses (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hasenstaub et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sohal et al., 2009</a>), slower feedforward inhibition might optimize information transfer by adapting the dynamic range of the neuron to the dynamic range of its inputs (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tan et al., 2008</a>), while changes in tonic inhibition might selectively delete irrelevant spikes or change the number of spikes available to represent information (<a href=\"#bib14\">Duguid et al., 2012</a>). These inhibitory dynamics and computational features have been differentially linked to Sst+ or Pvalb+ interneurons (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cardin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hasenstaub et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sohal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wehr and Zador, 2003</a>). To test whether optogenetically inactivating and activating these interneurons also produced discrepant effects on information transfer through cortical neurons, we calculated the per-trial mutual information (in bits/trial; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) between the stimulus and firing rate output, in both the light-off and light-on conditions, for each unit analyzed previously (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a,f</a>, example units). The effects of inactivating Sst+ cells on information-per-trial were significantly different from the effects of inactivating Pvalb+ cells (rank-sum p=7.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22126</sup>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b,c</a>): inactivating Sst+ cells significantly increased information-per-trial (sign-rank p=0.022), while inactivating Pvalb+ cells significantly decreased it (sign-rank p=1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22124</sup>). Are these different effects on information transfer produced by inactivation of Sst+ versus Pvalb+ cells simply related to overall changes in the number of spikes available to represent information? To address this, we calculated firing-rate-normalized mutual information (i.e., the information about the stimulus carried by each spike). The effects on information-per-spike of inactivating Sst+ cells versus Pvalb+ cells were significantly different (rank-sum p=1.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22125</sup>), inconsistent with the notion that the observed differences in information transfer were due to differences in firing rate modulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d,e</a>)."

We reasoned that not only will optogenetic manipulations of interneurons exert first-order effects on a given neuron, through direct inhibition or removal of inhibition, but they will also yield second-order effects, by altering the network-wide activity of the neuron\u2019s inputs. Consider an example in which one downstream neuron receives inputs from several upstream ('input-layer') neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a,h</a>). Each input neuron shows evoked responses that are tuned to particular frequencies, superimposed on a modest baseline level of activity, as is often the case in awake states (rev.

As we have previously demonstrated (<a href=\"#bib46\">Seybold et al., 2015</a>) divisive suppression acts purely linearly on the weighted inputs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7i,j</a>); from the perspective of a downstream neuron, the largest suppressive effect occurs near the center of its tuning curve. In contrast, subtractive suppression does not linearly suppress the firing of the input neurons because the weakest responses are suppressed below the nonlinear spiking threshold, creating a 'floor effect' at the edges of the tuning curve. In the downstream neuron, these nonlinear floor effects at the edges sum to produce the strongest suppression at the center of the tuning curve (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7n</a>), and thus, downstream, appear division-like (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7k,n</a>). Importantly, aspects of the network state such as its baseline firing rate determine the regime wherein such asymmetric effects between activation and inactivation will be observed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). For example, in a network with high spontaneous activity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8j</a>), interneurons must be activated more strongly in order to suppress their targets\u2019 firing rates below the spiking threshold; thus the range of interneuron manipulation levels over which the neural circuit behaves linearly is relatively large (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8l</a>). On the other hand, in a network with low spontaneous activity, in which the edges of the tuning curves already lie below threshold (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8p</a>), even small additive increases in firing rates are impacted by threshold nonlinearities; thus the linear operating range of the network becomes relatively small (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8r</a>).

The field cannot achieve this goal with correlative studies alone; causal manipulations are essential tools for conclusively linking interneuron subtypes to their respective cortical functions. Nonetheless, the assumptions and simplifications generally made when using these causal manipulations must be scrutinized. Given the surge in the use of molecular genetic tools to causally probe interneuron function, we tested whether one of the main assumptions underlying much of this work is true. Specifically, we tested the idea that differences in normal function between interneuron populations may be directly read out, and straightforwardly interpreted, by simply dialing interneuron activity up or down. In three different aspects of sensory processing within auditory cortex \u2013 the regulation of the gain, tuning, and information content of tone responses \u2013 we found that this intuitive assumption was not correct. Activation of Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons produced no significant differences in any of the three domains of sensory processing that we tested, even in cases where activation of interneurons caused equivalent and strong suppression, implying that Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons function equivalently in these aspects of sensory processing. In stark contrast, inactivation of Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons produced significant differences in all three domains: Pvalb+ cells appeared to increase information transfer through subtractive inhibition, whereas Sst+ cells appeared to provide divisive inhibition. That optogenetic activation and inactivation of interneurons did not produce symmetric results contradicts the intuitive notion that optogenetically increasing and decreasing interneuron activity necessarily strengthens and weakens, respectively, the functions these interneurons normally serve. How could optogenetic activation and inactivation of interneurons lead to these seemingly contradictory outcomes?"

                        "text": "One reason could be that activation and inactivation of interneurons may differentially affect how the features of interneuron-specific inhibition are propagated through a network like the cortex. To help the reader reason through this phenomenon, we used a simple multilayered model to show that, when activating interneurons, network structure and threshold nonlinearities can convert either subtractive or divisive inhibition of a neuron\u2019s local inputs into divisive inhibition of a network (<a href=\"#bib46\">Seybold et al., 2015</a>); yet when inactivating interneurons, multiplication and addition of local inputs may bypass these threshold nonlinearities and preserve their linear effects at the network level (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Whether such asymmetric effects will occur depends on both the level of interneuron manipulation and the baseline activity of the input neurons. At high baseline activity, when cells spend much of their time above threshold, moderate changes in firing do not interact with threshold nonlinearities and, thus, the range of manipulation levels that produces symmetric effects expands. On the other hand, at low baseline levels, cells spend much of their time below threshold, and even small changes in firing will interact with threshold nonlinearities; thus the range of symmetric effects decreases (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Importantly, this work suggests that optogenetic manipulations (both activation and inactivation) can be used as tools to reveal the operating range over which the network behaves linearly versus nonlinearly, with regards to any neuronal computation. This work goes beyond the previous work of our and other groups (<a href=\"#bib13\">Douglas et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Litwin-Kumar et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Murphy and Miller, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Seybold et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tsodyks et al., 1997</a>) that identify discrepancies between the single-cell and network-level consequences of inhibition. Here our goal is different: to understand the interactions between increasing or decreasing inhibition and the innate properties of the network, as part of a larger program of clarifying the ways in which we can \u2013 and cannot \u2013 use optogenetic and other causal strategies to establish the functions of specific cell types."

This consideration goes beyond the widely appreciated one that existing genetic targets may encompass several genetically distinct cell types (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ma et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tasic et al., 2016</a>). For example, from the viewpoint of a cortical pyramidal cell that receives inputs from several genetically similar interneurons, inactivation of these interneurons only suppresses neurons that are active during the stimulus. On the other hand, activation of these interneurons recruits most, if not all, of the interneurons \u2013 even those that are not normally activated by the stimulus. In this study, for example, a small population of the putative Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons fired weakly during the auditory stimulus (with a mean firing rate of less than 5\u2009Hz), but dramatically increased their firing, often well above 30\u2009Hz, with light stimulation. Moreover, recent work suggests that cortical Sst+ and Pvalb+ populations may contain subgroups that are differentially driven by patterns of cortical activity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kwan and Dan, 2012</a>), stimulus features (<a href=\"#bib45\">Runyan et al., 2010</a>), and task-related behaviors (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lagler et al., 2016</a>), suggesting that genetically-targeted activation of these cells may recruit more than one functional population. Thus, activation of these heterogeneous populations may strengthen different sets of functions than those weakened by their inactivation, leading to inconsistent conclusions regarding their normal function."

For example, in auditory cortex, Pvalb+ cells have been reported to be activated rapidly and by a broad set of tones, while Sst+ interneurons respond relatively slowly to a narrower range of tones (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2015</a>). These features, however, will not be replicated in studies in which interneuron firing is indiscriminately and tonically increased or decreased. Additionally, activating or inactivating interneurons beyond a certain threshold may drive the cortical network beyond its natural operating regime (for instance, by breaking inhibitory-excitatory balance [<a href=\"#bib40\">Ozeki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1998</a>], pushing the cortex towards epileptic states [<a href=\"#bib10\">Chagnac-Amitai and Connors, 1989</a>], or close to silence [<a href=\"#bib19\">Hess and Murata, 1974</a>]); in other words, a given change in interneuron activity may have a different effect in a normally active circuit compared to an over- or underactive circuit. Given these potential confounds, the results of this study further support the notion that the precise way in which we use causal tools, and the brain states in which the manipulations are performed, will govern the conclusions drawn about neural function."

For example, recent studies in visual cortex in which interneurons were activated with ChR2 have produced diverse and even opposing findings regarding interneuron subtypes\u2019 contributions to the gain and tuning of sensory responses (<a href=\"#bib6\">Atallah et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wilson et al., 2012</a>). The findings from our model suggest that, in any of these studies, including our own, activation of Sst+ or Pvalb+ interneurons may have suppressed input cell firing below nonlinear spiking threshold, transforming, or obfuscating, the computational properties of interneuron-specific inhibition. Our inactivation experiments, on the other hand, mostly agree with (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2012</a>), and support the idea that Pvalb+ cells subtractively suppress responses and increase information content by suppressing irrelevant spikes, whereas Sst+ cells divisively suppress responses to modulate dynamic range. However, we stress the caveat that both cell types may perform these operations in cooperation with other cell types (<a href=\"#bib22\">Karnani et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Pfeffer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Xu et al., 2013</a>) and through complex network dynamics that we have not identified here (<a href=\"#bib31\">Litwin-Kumar et al., 2016</a>).

Recently, it has been shown that transient inactivations may not replicate the results of permanent lesion studies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Otchy et al., 2015</a>). This can occur because brief manipulations in one brain region may transiently perturb the computations of downstream circuits and, thus, may not reveal circuit function within a steady-state. Our finding that opposing optogenetic manipulations can produce apparently paradoxical conclusions regarding cell-type function adds to the growing sentiment that the ease with which manipulation experiments can be performed belies the difficulty of their interpretation. We propose that activation may be particularly likely to mask normal interneuron function because it targets interneurons that are not normally active during a stimulus response, and it is likely to obscure distinctions between linear transformations within a nonlinear network; conversely, inactivation targets only the normally active subset of interneurons and is more likely to preserve distinctions between linear transformation types within a nonlinear network.To dissect how interneurons act cooperatively or individually to control cortical function, even modern causal manipulations must be carefully designed and interpreted."

On the day of recording, a second surgery was performed to expose the auditory cortex. For both surgeries, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and a subcutaneous injection of lidocaine under the incision site. As a post-operative analgesic, mice were given a subcutaneous injection of carprofen. An opening in the skull (\u223c2\u2009mm) centered over auditory cortex was drilled and then filled with silicone elastomer to protect the brain. Animals were allowed to recover from the anesthesia for 1\u20133\u2009hr, after which they were placed in a head holder on a free-spinning spherical treadmill (modified from [<a href=\"#bib37\">Niell and Stryker, 2008</a>]), after which the silicone plug was removed. Recordings were made using a 16 site linear probe (50\u2009\u03bcm spacing, Neuronexus), inserted perpendicular to the cortical surface. Stimuli consisted of randomly ordered 20 or 50 ms tones of various frequencies (4 kHz to 64 kHz, 0.2 octave spacing, 1\u2009s interstimulus interval, with the intensity level chosen as 10\u201315 dB above threshold at BF) presented through a free-field high-frequency speaker (ES1, Tucker-Davis Technologies,\u00a0Alachua,\u00a0FL). In most experiments a second tone was played either 50 or 70 ms after the onset of the first tone for a different set of analyses. Thus only the first 50 ms of the first tone response was analyzed."

Recordings with blue light were performed with a light power near 15 \u03bcW (range 1 to 25 \u03bcW), which typically suppressed firing to about 50% of the light-off condition. Recordings with green light were performed with a light power near 10 mW (range 10 to 15 mW), which typically increased firing to about 150% of the light-off condition. The light began at least 50 ms (up to 250 ms) before the tone onset, linearly ramped up to full power for 50 ms, and remained on until 100 ms after the end of the stimulus. Each stimulus was presented 10\u201350 times with and without light. Responses were amplified and digitized continuously with a 16-channel recording system (Tucker-Davis Technologies) at 24,414\u2009Hz. Events in the recordings that crossed a threshold of 4 SD were collected and sorted using custom software in MATLAB (KFMMAutosorter, written by Matthew Fellows) to identify single units."

The distribution of trough-to-peak durations was bimodal (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), allowing us to group unit waveforms into narrow-spiking (\u2264450 \u03bcs) or broad-spiking (&gt;450 \u03bcs) categories. Event rasters for each unit were constructed around each tone and used to produce frequency tuning curves. The response onset was calculated as the time a unit\u2019s response reached \u00bc of the maximum response, and the frequency tuning curve for each unit was defined to be the firing rate during the period between this calculated response onset and 50 ms after it, as a function of frequency. A unit was defined as tuned if the frequency tuning curve was significantly (\u03b1 = 0.05) modulated by frequency, calculated using a 1-way ANOVA, and if at least three responses in both the light-off and light-on conditions were significantly (\u03b1 = 0.05) above zero. The firing rate suppression or enhancement ratio for each unit was calculated as the percent change in spikes-per-trial during the response period, averaged over all stimuli. A unit was considered significantly suppressed or enhanced by the light if the number of tone-evoked spikes during the 50 ms response period across all stimulus conditions with light was significantly (\u03b1 &lt; 0.05) different from that without light. For <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, we calculated baseline-subtracted tone-evoked firing by subtracting the average spontaneous firing rate, measured from 0 to 50 ms before stimulus onset, from the tone-evoked rates. For <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, units from either ChR2/Sst and ChR2/Pvalb mice, or Arch/Sst and Arch/Pvalb mice were matched based on their firing rate ratios by selecting pairs of units between the two groups that were within a distance of a tenth of the range of all firing rate ratios. If a unit in one group did not have a matching unit in the other group within this distance, it was discarded. We analyzed linear transformations using standardized major axis regression, which is necessary to account for the measurement variance on both the x and y axis, which ordinary least-squares regression does not (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sokal and Rohlf, 2012</a>). Only stimuli that elicited a firing rate significantly above zero in both light-off and light-on conditions were included in the analysis to avoid floor effects on spiking activity which could bias the regression and cause a subtractive effect to appear divisive. Units were deemed to show significant divisive or multiplicative transformations if the regression slope was significantly (\u03b1 = 0.05) less than one or greater than one, respectively. Units were deemed to show significant subtractive or additive transformations if the regression y-intercept was significantly (\u03b1 = 0.05) less than zero or greater than zero, respectively."

Because we have a limited number of trials from which to sample the stimulus and response probability distributions, MI might be upwardly biased. To account for this bias, we repeatedly (500 times) shuffled stimulus-response pairs, such that each response was associated with a randomly chosen stimulus, thus eliminating information due to a real relationship between the stimulus and response, but retaining information due to a bias. We then subtracted the average of the shuffled MI values from the originally measured MI to obtain the bias-corrected MI. We applied this method to both light-off and light-on conditions separately. To calculate information-per-spike for each unit, we divided the information-per-trial by the average firing rate (spikes-per-trial)."

Unless otherwise stated, spiking threshold was set to 0. The connection weights of these inputs onto the downstream neuron decreased from a maximum of 0.2, at the best frequency of the downstream neuron, according to a Gaussian connectivity function with a standard deviation of 2. Divisive inhibition was then modeled by multiplying the input tuning curves by 0.5, while multiplication was modeled by multiplying the input tuning curves by 1.5. We modeled subtractive and additive changes in firing by subtracting and adding, respectively, 0.15 from the entire tuning curve of each input neuron. In <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, the baseline firing of the input neurons was varied by changing the spiking threshold (i.e., by adding or subtracting a constant to each Gaussian input curve). For moderate baseline firing, threshold remained at 0, for low baseline firing threshold was set to 0.1 and for high baseline firing the threshold was set to \u22120.1."

Second, it seems that the authors have conducted a number of analyses to control for varying effects of optogenetic stimulation on different neurons during the tone responses. How do the effects of optogenetic stimulation on spontaneous activity compare to effects on tone-evoked responses? Would it be possible to quantify tone response magnitude rather than firing rate, which may be the more relevant quantity used by the brain to make behavioral decisions (reviewer #2, point #2)? Related to this issue, have the authors looked at the effect of varying intensity of laser stimulations? Third, it appears that one way to look at the experiments is that they are testing the dynamic range at which the neural circuits operate in a linear regime with regard to gain, frequency tuning, or information content of tone-evoked responses (reviewer #3, point #2).

To quantify whether these manipulations caused divisive or subtractive changes in tuning curves, responses in light-on trials were regressed by responses in light-off trials. Divisive changes were detected as a significant change in slope whereas subtractive changes were detected as a significant change in intercept. Furthermore, the authors compared the ability of each neuron to transmit stimulus information using mutual information between the two conditions (activation versus inactivation). The authors' results showed that activating and inactivating specific interneurons often caused inconsistent results across these two conditions. The authors further explored potential mechanisms underlying these discrepancies using a simple network model, suggesting that some nonlinearity such as flooring of firing rates may explain these discrepancies.

The effects on putative excitatory neuronal responses to tones were multiplicative with inactivation of SOMs and additive with inactivation of PVs, whereas activation of either PVs or SOMs led to a mix of subtractive and divisive effects. The latter result is consistent with a recent paper by the authors (Seybold et al., Neuron, 2015), whereas the former is novel to this manuscript.

Optogenetic manipulation of PVs and SSTs is represented as a multiplicative or divisive shift in the input units. It would be interesting whether this effect can be modeled through rate equations in which the optogenetic inputs would be represented as enhanced drive to inhibitory neuronal populations. This would also be interesting to examine w/r varying light intensity or varying magnitude of the effect of laser on spontaneous activity."
