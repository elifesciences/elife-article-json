Here we describe a novel model of thyroid carcinoma in zebrafish that reveals temporal changes due to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. Through the use of real-time <i>in vivo</i> imaging we observe disruption in thyroid follicle structure that occurs early in thyroid development. Combinatorial treatment using BRAF and MEK inhibitors reversed the developmental effects induced by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. Adult zebrafish expressing BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in thyrocytes developed invasive carcinoma. We identified a gene expression signature from zebrafish thyroid cancer that is predictive of disease free survival in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. Gene expression studies nominated TWIST2 as a key effector downstream of BRAF. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to genetically inactivate a TWIST2 orthologue, we suppressed the effects of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and restored thyroid morphology and hormone synthesis. These data suggest that expression of TWIST2 plays a role in an early step of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mediated transformation."
