Plant guard cells, that form stomatal pores for gas exchange, provide a powerful system for in depth investigation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling specificity in plants. In intact guard cells, abscisic acid (ABA) enhances (primes) the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of downstream signaling events that result in activation of S-type anion channels during stomatal closure, providing a specificity mechanism in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling. However, the underlying genetic and biochemical mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show impairment of ABA signal transduction in stomata of calcium-dependent protein kinase quadruple mutant plants. Interestingly, protein phosphatase 2Cs prevent non-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling. Moreover, we demonstrate an unexpected interdependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent ABA-signaling branches and the <i>in planta</i> requirement of simultaneous phosphorylation at two key phosphorylation sites in SLAC1. We identify novel mechanisms ensuring specificity and robustness within stomatal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling on a cellular, genetic, and biochemical level."

Plant guard cells, that form stomatal pores for gas exchange, provide a powerful system for in depth investigation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling specificity in plants. In intact guard cells, abscisic acid (ABA) enhances (primes) the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of downstream signaling events that result in activation of S-type anion channels during stomatal closure, providing a specificity mechanism in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling. However, the underlying genetic and biochemical mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show impairment of ABA signal transduction in stomata of calcium-dependent protein kinase quadruple mutant plants. Interestingly, protein phosphatase 2Cs prevent non-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling. Moreover, we demonstrate an unexpected interdependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent ABA-signaling branches and the <i>in planta</i> requirement of simultaneous phosphorylation at two key phosphorylation sites in SLAC1. We identify novel mechanisms ensuring specificity and robustness within stomatal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling on a cellular, genetic, and biochemical level."

Therefore, it is not clear how abscisic acid works to specifically \u2018prime\u2019 guard cells to close the stomata in response to increases in calcium ions during drought. Brandt, Munemasa et al. studied stomata in a plant called <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. The experiments show that, in the presence of abscisic acid, mutant plants that lack four different CPK enzymes are impaired in the activation of SLAC1 and the closing of stomata in response to increases in calcium ions."

Switching off PP2Cs enables closing of the stomata in response to calcium ions. It has been suggested previously that the CPKs and the calcium-independent enzymes are involved in two separate pathways that promote the closure of stomata. However, Brandt, Munemasa et al. found that the calcium-independent enzymes are required for calcium ions to activate SLAC1 in guard cells, revealing that these two pathways are linked."

Elucidation of the mechanisms mediating specificity in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is fundamental to understanding signal transduction (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berridge et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hetherington and Woodward, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Clapham, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Webb, 2013</a>). In a few cases, the biochemical and cellular mechanisms mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling specificity have been revealed (e.g. <a href=\"#bib22\">De Koninck and Schulman, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Dolmetsch et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Oancea and Meyer, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dolmetsch et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bradshaw et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Rellos et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chao et al., 2011</a>).

Two guard cells form a stomatal pore representing the gateway for CO<sub>2</sub> influx, which is inevitably accompanied by plant water loss. The aperture of stomatal pores is consequently tightly regulated by the guard cells. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> represents a key second messenger in stomatal closing (<a href=\"#bib58\">McAinsh et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">MacRobbie, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Hetherington, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hetherington and Woodward, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hubbard et al., 2012</a>), but intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> also functions in stomatal opening (<a href=\"#bib42\">Irving et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Shimazaki et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Curvetto et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Shimazaki et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cousson and Vavasseur, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Young et al., 2006</a>), raising the question how cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) elevations trigger a specific cellular response. The underlying mechanisms mediating specificity in guard cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling are not well understood. The development of genetic, electrophysiological, and cell signaling tools for the dissection of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within this model cell type renders guard cells a powerful system for the investigation of specificity mechanisms within Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal transduction. Recent studies including analyses in intact <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib102\">Young et al., 2006</a>) and <i>Vicia faba</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2010</a>) guard cells, have shown that stomatal closing stimuli including abscisic acid (ABA) and CO<sub>2</sub> enhance the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> sensitivity of downstream signaling mechanisms, switching them from an inactivated state to an enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive \u2018primed\u2019 state, thus tightly controlling specificity in Ca<sup>2+</sup> responsiveness (<a href=\"#bib102\">Young et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Munemasa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Siegel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Xue et al., 2011</a>). A rise of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> from resting to elevated levels alone does not trigger the full ion channel regulation and stomatal response (<a href=\"#bib102\">Young et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Munemasa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Siegel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Xue et al., 2011</a>). Similarly, a recent study of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) signaling suggests that prior PAMP signaling enhances the sensitivity to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> during signal transduction (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kadota et al., 2014</a>), indicating that this principle for Ca<sup>2+</sup> specificity priming may be more widely used in plants. The biological closing stimulus has to be present for the guard cell to react to physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation. However, the biochemical and genetic mechanisms mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity priming remain unknown."

Presently, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u2013independent branches are considered to function independently (e.g. <a href=\"#bib51\">Li et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kim and et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Roelfsema et al., 2012</a>). The activation of SLAC1 by OST1 or CPK6 is inhibited by the clade A protein phosphatase 2Cs (PP2Cs) ABI1, ABI2, or PP2CA in oocytes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Geiger et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Brandt et al., 2012</a>).

However, whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and\u2013independent branches in ABA signal transduction are functionally linked and depend on one-another <i>in planta</i> remains to be investigated using higher order genetic mutants. Here we present biochemical, genetic and cellular signaling findings that describe mechanisms underlying specificity and robustness in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within a single cell type and demonstrate an unexpected strong dependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signal transduction branch on the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent pathway in guard cells. Moreover our results suggest that in contrast to OST1 (<a href=\"#bib89\">Umezawa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Vlad et al., 2009</a>), calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are not directly deactivated by PP2Cs, but these PP2Cs rapidly deactivate both of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u2013independent branches by directly dephosphorylating the protein kinase target SLAC1."

We addressed the question whether higher order <i>CPK</i> gene disruption mutant plants display more strongly impaired ABA responses. CPK6 and CPK23 were shown to activate SLAC1 in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes and disruption of the corresponding genes in plants leads to a partial reduction of S-type anion current activation in guard cells (<a href=\"#bib61\">Mori et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Geiger et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Brandt et al., 2012</a>). The closest homolog to CPK6, CPK5, is associated with reactive oxygen species signaling (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boudsocq et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Dubiella et al., 2013</a>). CPK5 also activates SLAC1 in oocytes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Whole-cell patch-clamp analysis showed that mutation of <i>CPK5</i> alone does not substantially disrupt ABA-activation of S-type anion channels (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>), consistent with findings of over-lapping gene functions in this response (<a href=\"#bib61\">Mori et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hubbard et al., 2012</a>). CPK11 is highly expressed in guard cells and involved in ABA responses (<a href=\"#bib103\">Zhu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Geiger et al., 2009</a>). We isolated <i>cpk5/6/11/23</i> quadruple T-DNA insertion mutant plants and investigated ABA-induced S-type anion channel current regulation. Either ABA treatment (<a href=\"#bib87\">Siegel et al., 2009</a>) or by-passing ABA signaling by exposure of guard cells to a high external Ca<sup>2+</sup> shock (<a href=\"#bib5\">Allen et al., 2002</a>) renders wildtype (Col0) guard cells sensitive to physiological [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> increases. Notably, even when previously exposed to ABA or a high external Ca<sup>2+</sup> shock, 2 \u03bcM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> did not result in S-type anion current activation in <i>cpk5/6/11/23</i> quadruple mutant guard cells in contrast to WT plants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013D</a>). These results show an important role of these calcium sensing protein kinases in ABA-dependent S-type anion channel activation in guard cells. We further investigated ABA-induced stomatal movement responses. Application of 5 \u03bcM ABA to WT leaves significantly decreased stomatal apertures compared to mock-treated control stomatal apertures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; p &lt; 0.05). In the <i>cpk5/6/11/23</i> mutant, however, 5 \u03bcM ABA-induced stomatal closing was not significant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; p = 0.51). When the ABA concentration was increased to 10 \u03bcM, ABA-induced stomatal closure was weakened in <i>cpk5/6/11/23</i> mutant leaves (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>; p = 0.07; 0 min ABA-exposed <i>cpk5/6/11/23</i> mutant leaves compared to 60 min ABA-exposed <i>cpk5/6/11/23</i> mutant leaves). The partial ABA response at the higher ABA concentration may be linked to parallel activation of R-type anion channels (see \u2018Discussion\u2019)."

                                "text": "Based on the above results we sought to determine the biochemical mechanisms by which PP2Cs down-regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in the absence of ABA. The main SLAC1-activating protein kinase in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent branch, OST1 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Mustilli et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Yoshida et al., 2002</a>), is directly inactivated by PP2Cs through de-phosphorylation of the activation loop (<a href=\"#bib89\">Umezawa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Vlad et al., 2009</a>). We tested whether CPKs might be down-regulated by PP2Cs in a similar manner and whether <i>pp2c</i> quadruple mutant plants may also exhibit a constitutive OST1 activity. Our first approach to test whether CPK activity is regulated by ABA through PP2Cs was an in-gel protein kinase assay using protein extracts of <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings, which is routinely used to test OST1 activation by ABA (<a href=\"#bib65\">Mustilli et al., 2002</a>) and also CPK activation by flg22 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boudsocq et al., 2010</a>). Guard cell [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> ranges from resting levels of \u22480.15 \u03bcM to stimulus induced elevated levels of above 1 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#bib58\">McAinsh et al., 1990</a>). Similar to studies reporting the ABA-activation of SnRK2.2, SnRK2.3, and SnRK2.6/OST1 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Mustilli et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Yoshida et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Fujii et al., 2007</a>), we compared the phosphorylation pattern of a reaction carried out at 0.15 \u03bcM free Ca<sup>2+</sup> with the phosphorylation pattern at 3 \u03bcM free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; for intermediate free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 0.4 \u03bcM Ca<sup>2+</sup> see <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Incubating the gels in a reaction buffer with 3 \u03bcM free Ca<sup>2+</sup> led to strong Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated phosphorylation signals compared to resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> at 0.15 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). To determine whether these Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated signals are CPK-derived we included two distinct quadruple mutants, <i>cpk5/6/11/23</i> and <i>cpk1/2/5/6</i>, in the in-gel kinase assays. Several Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated bands disappeared or became notably weaker when extracts were tested from <i>cpk5/6/11/23</i> and <i>cpk1/2/5/6</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boudsocq et al., 2010</a>) plants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and for improved visibility <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

In-gel protein kinase assays using recombinant proteins were pursued in which kinases and phosphatases are separated by size prior to substrate phosphorylation. CPK6, and as positive control OST1, were pre-incubated either alone or with ABI1 or PP2CA with and without ATP before being subjected to in-gel protein kinase assays.

We next investigated the kinetics and specificity of PP2C down-regulation of SLAC1 activation by CPKs through dephosphorylation of the SLAC1 channel, a mechanism reported for CPK-dependent transcription factor regulation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Lynch et al., 2012</a>) and consistent with previous findings (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brandt et al., 2012</a>). First, we determined whether SLAC1 interacts with the PP2C ABI1 <i>in planta</i> using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). We observed clear BiFC signals for full length SLAC1 co-expressed with CPK6 and ABI1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>) while signal intensities of SLAC1 co-expressed with a control protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit 5 (PP2AC5) were very low (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Protein\u2013protein interaction of SLAC1 with PP2CA in BiFC experiments was reported earlier (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lee et al., 2009</a>).

Already 1 min after the addition of ABI1 a strong decrease of the phosphorylation signal was observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, lane 4). This de-phosphorylation was also found when the PP2C phosphatase PP2CA was added instead of ABI1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,E</a>, lane 4). To test whether this is a general phenomenon, we phosphorylated the SLAC1-NT with the SLAC1-activating and -phosphorylating kinases CPK21, CPK23, and OST1 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Geiger et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lee et al., 2009</a>) and analyzed whether ABI1 and PP2CA are able to remove phospho-groups added by these kinases (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013H</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The amino acid residue serine 120 of SLAC1 has been shown to be required for OST1, but not for CPK23 activation of SLAC1 in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Geiger et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2010</a>). A different site, serine 59, has been shown to be required for SLAC1 activation by CPK6 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brandt et al., 2012</a>). Thus we investigated whether several CPKs can activate the SLAC1 S120A mutant in oocytes and whether the SLAC1 S59A mutant is activated by OST1 and other CPKs in oocytes. CPK5, CPK6, and CPK23 activation of SLAC1 S120A was similar to WT SLAC1 activation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). In contrast, SLAC1 S59A activation by these CPKs was strongly impaired (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Interestingly however, OST1 was able to activate SLAC1 S59A (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>), which was confirmed in multiple independent experimental sets under the imposed conditions. These results suggest that S59 is required for strong activation by protein kinases of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent CPK branch, while S120 represents a crucial amino acid for strong activation by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent branch of the ABA signaling core. To avoid spurious phosphorylation by high protein kinase concentrations in oocytes, effects of co-expression of CPK6 and OST1 at low levels that do not fully activate SLAC1 were investigated. These experiments show a clear enhanced SLAC1 activation in oocytes when both kinases are co-expressed (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>). This enhancement of SLAC1 activation by OST1 became less clear when an inactive OST1 protein kinase (OST1 D140A) was analyzed (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>)."

In the absence of ABA, Ca<sup>2+</sup> responsiveness is inhibited by PP2Cs, thereby preventing responses to unrelated stomatal opening-mediating stimuli (<a href=\"#bib42\">Irving et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Shimazaki et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Curvetto et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Shimazaki et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cousson and Vavasseur, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Young et al., 2006</a>) and also spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations (<a href=\"#bib102\">Young et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Siegel et al., 2009</a>). As PP2Cs inhibit OST1 and also down-regulate SLAC1 directly, this network not only enables stimulus specific activation of SLAC1, but also provides a tight off switch via PP2C-catalyzed dephosphorylation of SLAC1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This mechanism could also prevent SLAC1 activation by CPK23 which exhibits a moderate Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Geiger et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, as PP2Cs control Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling specificity downstream of the CPK Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), the same CPK isoforms remain capable of fulfilling other signaling roles, consistent with several studies (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boudsocq et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Munemasa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Dubiella et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gao et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, the same MAP kinase genes have been shown to function in multiple plant signaling pathways and unknown mechanisms mediating specificity are required (<a href=\"#bib77\">Rodriguez et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Xu and Zhang, 2015</a>).

In contrast, the present study and other recent research shows a clear dephosphorylation of SLAC1 by PP2Cs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brandt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Maierhofer et al., 2014</a>). Here we demonstrate that ABI1 and PP2CA not only dephosphorylate the SLAC1 N-terminus, but these PP2Cs are able to very rapidly remove the OST1- and CPK-mediated phosphorylation of SLAC1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013H</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity is demonstrated here to be constitutively primed in <i>pp2c</i> quadruple mutant guard cells, showing that PP2Cs ensure Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling specificity. Interestingly, PP2Cs do not directly down-regulate CPK activity, in contrast to direct PP2C down-regulation of the SnRK2 protein kinases. Rather PP2Cs very rapidly down-regulate signaling targets downstream of CPKs, which could enable the same CPKs to function in more than one pathway. We have further identified a <i>cpk</i> quadruple mutant here that for the first time strongly abrogates ABA activation of S-type anion channels. This abrogation occurs despite an intact Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent SnRK2 signaling branch. Furthermore, disruption of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent signaling branch in <i>snrk2</i> protein kinase triple mutant plants abrogates Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Thus, unexpectedly genetic analyses reveal a dependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive ABA signaling branch on the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive branch <i>in planta</i>. The control of ABA-triggered stomatal closure by parallel interdependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and\u2013independent mechanisms could contribute to the robustness of the stomatal ABA signaling network (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hetherington, 2001</a>). Unexpectedly, <i>in planta</i> studies show that the S59 and S120 phosphorylation sites in SLAC1 are together required for intact ABA-induced stomatal closing in vivo. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity priming mechanism described here could represent a more general principle present in plants contributing to Ca<sup>2+</sup> specificity within cellular signal transduction pathways, while also maintaining the availability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling outputs."

The recording solution contained 10 mM MES/Tris (pH 5.6), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM KCl, 24 mM NaCl, and 70 mM Na-gluconate. Osmolality was adjusted to 220 mM using D-sorbitol. Oocytes were held at a holding potential of 0 mV, and subjected to voltage pulse from +40 mV to \u2212120 mV, \u2212140 mV, or \u2212160 mV in \u221220 mV decrements. The amounts of injected cRNA were 10 ng except for <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A,E</a>. For the experiments shown in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A,E</a> the amounts of injected cRNA were 5 ng of SLAC1, 0.5 ng of CPK6, and 7.5 ng of OST1."

This adds to an earlier model where PP2C action reversed CPK dependent phosphorylation of SLAC1 and also dephosphorylated OST1, directly inactivating the kinase. The essential new idea then is that the N terminus of Slac1 serves as a coincidence detector, which is a nice addition to the current knowledge, but the reviewers considered this a \u2018refinement\u2019 of the current model rather than a significant conceptual advancement. Furthermore, the coincidence detection idea is not tested directly, for example with SLAC1 S59A, S120A single and double mutants introduced into the background of a SLAC1 loss-of-function mutant. The model predicts that such mutants would not be activated by ABA, and would not show constitutive activation in the PP2C quadruple mutant. Similarly, phospho-mimic single and double mutants in oocyte expression and in planta experiments would further enhance the understanding of ABA-signaling in guard cells."

The consensus in the field is that protoplasts are impaired in many normal cellular functions. The cytosol of cells is strongly diluted and evidence for degradation of major guard cell functions has been published. The experiments here are carried out following a preincubation of protoplasts with ABA. The authors can therefore not exclude that the ABA-signaling complex is established and solidified by ABA incubation and therefore the dilution prior to patch clamp measurements is weaker than in the absence of ABA. This scenario would lead to similar results, but would have nothing to do with ABA-priming."

Thus, calcium is sufficient for anion channel activation (without ABA priming). Moreover, reports from Chen et al., (2010, Plant J), Marten et al., (2007, Plant Physiol.), Stange et al., (2010, Plant J) and Levchenko et al., (2005, PNAS) illustrated that the ABA-signaling pathway is bifurcated: On one branch, ABA activates S-type anion channels without the need of cytosolic calcium elevations and on the other, ABA activates anion channels in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent manner. These findings contradict the interdependence of both pathways and the priming of the guard cell calcium sensitivity by ABA as reported by the authors here. Even more importantly, the experiments by Marten et al., (2007, Plant Physiol.), Stange et al., (2010, Plant J) and Levchenko et al., (2005, PNAS) were conducted with intact plants and a minimal invasive guard cell impalement technique, simultaneously recording the rise in cytosolic calcium and S-type anion currents.

To address this question we used a second approach: An in-gel protein kinase assay with recombinant proteins. Here, kinases were either incubated with or without recombinant PP2Cs (+/- <i>non</i>-radioactive ATP). After stopping the reactions the proteins were separated by size, re-natured and subsequently incubated in a reaction buffer containing radioactive ATP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3 C-D</a>). At this point, when the reaction takes place, the phosphatases and the kinases are immobilized, separated by size and cannot directly interact anymore which makes a direct de-phosphorylation impossible. The same applies to experiment 3."

Similar results were obtained in <a href=\"#bib10\">Boudosq et al., 2010</a> studying the role of CPKs in pathogen responses. Therefore the in-gel kinase assays shown in this manuscript represent mainly CPK trans-phosphorylation activities and not auto-phosphorylation activities. That ABA-application to seedlings did not lead to electro-mobility shifts of CPK-derived bands indicates that in planta, the ABA-regulated phosphatases do not de-phosphorylate the CPKs in an ABA-dependent manner.

However, this simple model had not yet been investigated directly until the above experiments. Here we show using multiple independent biochemical approaches that this simple model is not supported as the mechanism mediating ABA signaling. Moreover, our positive controls with the OST1 protein kinase show that the methods used are reliable.

As described earlier we have now generated and characterized in planta point-mutated SLAC1 complementation lines (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G-H</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 3</a>) by performing patch clamp experiments and stomatal movement experiments. We have found that both S59A and S120A mutations together are required to disrupt ABA activation of S-type anion channels and stomatal closing in guard cells. These data also show the value of such experiments in guard cells compared to <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes. We revised the text of the manuscript. In addition to these guard cell and stomatal movement data, we have pursued further <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte data that show that the additive effect is dependent on protein kinase activity of intact OST1 (non-split-YFP tagged) (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 2E</a>). Our new in planta data also show some limitations of interpreting only oocyte data, even though oocytes allow important testing of models, as done in previous studies. We suspect that expressing high concentrations of protein kinases in oocytes may play a role (rather than too low protein kinase activities in oocytes as proposed by the reviewer). Meaning that expression of a high concentration of a protein kinase may well be able to activate the heterologous target protein via mechanisms that are not active in planta. This may not be surprising to some readers, but this limitation of oocyte experiments has not previously been demonstrated for the ABA signaling pathway and will add additional helpful information for the community. Thus in the present manuscript almost all electrophysiological studies are performed in guard cells and with direct comparisons of WT and higher order <i>cpk</i> , <i>snrk2</i> and <i>pp2c</i> mutants and parallel stomatal movement response analyses. In response to the reviewer comment and based on our new data we have re-worded the interpretation of the results in the manuscript and avoid over-interpreting data from oocyte experiments."

Note also that recombinant CPK6 protein kinase activity is known to be approximately 100-fold higher than recombinant OST1 protein kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Brandt et al., 2012</a>) and therefore higher OST1 mRNA levels than CPK6 levels were used).

Our manuscript investigates only specific linked aspects in oocytes, with all other electrophysiological experiments focusing on guard cells.
