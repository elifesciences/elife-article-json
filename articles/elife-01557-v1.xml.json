                    "text": "In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase activates genes required for proliferation and silences genes that promote differentiation. Here we show that the class II histone deacetylase Hdac6 co-purifies with Tip60-p400 complex from ESCs. Hdac6 is necessary for regulation of most Tip60-p400 target genes, particularly those repressed by the complex. Unlike differentiated cells, where Hdac6 is mainly cytoplasmic, Hdac6 is largely nuclear in ESCs, neural stem cells (NSCs), and some cancer cell lines, and interacts with Tip60-p400 in each. Hdac6 localizes to promoters bound by Tip60-p400 in ESCs, binding downstream of transcription start sites. Surprisingly, Hdac6 does not appear to deacetylate histones, but rather is required for Tip60-p400 binding to many of its target genes. Finally, we find that, like canonical subunits of Tip60-p400, Hdac6 is necessary for robust ESC differentiation. These data suggest that Hdac6 plays a major role in the modulation of Tip60-p400 function in stem cells."

Here we show that the class II histone deacetylase Hdac6 co-purifies with Tip60-p400 complex from ESCs. Hdac6 is necessary for regulation of most Tip60-p400 target genes, particularly those repressed by the complex. Unlike differentiated cells, where Hdac6 is mainly cytoplasmic, Hdac6 is largely nuclear in ESCs, neural stem cells (NSCs), and some cancer cell lines, and interacts with Tip60-p400 in each. Hdac6 localizes to promoters bound by Tip60-p400 in ESCs, binding downstream of transcription start sites. Surprisingly, Hdac6 does not appear to deacetylate histones, but rather is required for Tip60-p400 binding to many of its target genes. Finally, we find that, like canonical subunits of Tip60-p400, Hdac6 is necessary for robust ESC differentiation. These data suggest that Hdac6 plays a major role in the modulation of Tip60-p400 function in stem cells."

Regulators of gene expression can be further sub-divided into (i) sequence-specific transcription factors, including ESC-specific master regulators, (ii) non-coding RNAs that act both in cis and in trans to regulate specific subsets of genes, and (iii) chromatin regulatory complexes, most of which are expressed in multiple cell and tissue types, and often act very broadly in the genome to covalently modify histones, remodel nucleosomes, or modify higher-order chromatin folding (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hanna et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Young, 2011</a>). A number of chromatin regulators have been identified from RNA-interference screens or traditional knockout studies that are important for various features of ESC identity. However, for most chromatin regulatory complexes, several key questions remain, including how they find their genomic targets, how their catalytic activities lead to alteration of gene expression, and how the activities of these factors are altered to facilitate differentiation."

For example, the mammalian SWI/SNF-family complex BAF (<span class=\"underline\">B</span>rg1/Brahma <span class=\"underline\">A</span>ssociated <span class=\"underline\">F</span>actor) consists of several related complexes with many shared subunits, plus a few subunits that are specific to each particular cell type. In particular, when neural progenitors differentiate into neurons in mouse, two BAF subunits are replaced with two paralogous subunits that shift BAF from a factor promoting self-renewal to one that promotes differentiation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lessard et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yoo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hanna et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Young, 2011</a>).

In somatic cells, Tip60-p400 serves mainly as a transcriptional co-activator that functions with numerous sequence-specific transcription factors to activate gene expression (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brady et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baek et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Frank et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Legube et al., 2004</a>). In contrast, while Tip60-p400 promotes expression of some genes required for cellular proliferation and cell cycle regulation in ESCs, its most prominent function is to silence genes that are active during differentiation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fazzio et al., 2008a</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">2008b</a>). RNAi-mediated knockdown (KD) of several Tip60-p400 subunits in ESCs individually induces a phenotype in which differentiation and ESC markers are expressed simultaneously, proliferation is reduced, the cell cycle is altered, and cells exhibit diminished self-renewal and pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fazzio et al., 2008a</a>). Consistent with these phenotypes, mice homozygous for a <i>Tip60</i> deletion allele die at the pre-implantation stage (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hu et al., 2009</a>). It remains unknown why Tip60-p400 functions mainly as a repressor of differentiation gene expression in ESCs rather than an activator of expressed genes, as it does in most cell types examined."

Therefore, maintenance of proper levels of histone acetylation appears to be essential to perpetuate the pluripotent state, as neither significant increases nor decreases in histone acetylation appear to be compatible with ESC self-renewal. However, TSA also inhibits several HDAC family members known to target acetylated lysines on non-histone proteins, leaving open the possibility that these targets play an equal or greater role in maintenance of ESC self-renewal. Furthermore, deletion or KD of several individual HDACs in ESCs produces phenotypes that differ substantially from those of Tip60-p400 subunits (<a href=\"#bib39\">McBurney et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dovey et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that different HDACs perform different functions in ESC self-renewal."

We find that the class II histone deacetylase (HDAC), Hdac6, is a stable interaction partner with Tip60-p400 in ESCs, but not mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Subsequent analyses revealed that Hdac6 also interacts with Tip60-p400 in adult neural stem cells from the brain and some cancer cell lines, but is sequestered away from Tip60-p400 in the cytoplasm of most differentiated cell types, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib48\">Verdel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hubbert et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kawaguchi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Valenzuela-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2008</a>). We show that Hdac6 is necessary for regulation of most Tip60-target genes in ESCs, particularly differentiation genes repressed by Tip60-p400 in ESCs. Surprisingly, while its deacetylase domains are required for silencing of differentiation genes, Hdac6 does not regulate gene expression by deacetylating histones near the promoters of Tip60-p400 targets. Instead, the catalytic domains of Hdac6 are required for its interaction with Tip60-p400. Furthermore, we find that Hdac6 is necessary for normal Tip60-p400 enrichment at its gene targets, just downstream of their transcription start sites (TSSs), suggesting that Hdac6 helps recruit Tip60-p400 complex to many target gene promoters. Finally, we show that Hdac6 is necessary for several major functions of Tip60-p400 in ESCs, as both <i>Tip60-</i> and <i>Hdac6</i>-deficient ESCs have defects in formation of single colonies, reduced proliferation rates, and defects in differentiation. However, unlike <i>Tip60</i> KD, <i>Hdac6</i> KD does not prevent ESC self-renewal. Thus, Hdac6 is a component of a novel, stem cell-specific, form of Tip60-p400 complex that is necessary for gene regulation and normal differentiation in ESCs."

However, in ESCs, Tip60-p400 is required for repression of many more genes than it activates, raising the possibility that a unique form of Tip60-p400 complex that might be expressed in ESCs that shifts the balance of its activity toward a more repressive role. To test this possibility, we targeted a 36 amino acid 6-histidine-3-FLAG (H3F) tag to the C-terminus of one copy of the endogenous <i>Tip60</i> gene in murine ESCs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), performed double affinity purifications from tagged or untagged cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and identified proteins that co-purified with Tip60 using LC-MS/MS (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). By this approach, we identified 16 of 17 known subunits (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ikura et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Doyon et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Altaf et al., 2009</a>) of Tip60-p400, suggesting that expression of the tagged form of Tip60 from its endogenous locus allowed for normal complex formation. Furthermore, we observed a number of novel Tip60-p400-interacting proteins, including chromatin regulatory proteins and transcription factors. To test for cell type specificity of Tip60-p400 complexes we generated a knock-in mouse harboring <i>Tip60-H3F</i>, isolated embryonic fibroblasts and repeated the purification. We observed several bands within Tip60 purifications from ESCs that were not observed in purifications from <i>Tip60-H3F</i> MEFs or untagged cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), consistent with the possibility that ESCs express a distinct form of Tip60-p400 complex."

Hdac6 is a class II histone deacetylase (HDAC) that is expressed in many different cell types but is usually localized to the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib48\">Verdel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hubbert et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kawaguchi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Valenzuela-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2008</a>), as are its well-established substrates: \u03b1-tubulin (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hubbert et al., 2002</a>), Hsp90 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kovacs et al., 2005</a>), and cortactin (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, despite its homology to proteins that deacetylate histone tails, Hdac6 has not been found to target histones in vivo (<a href=\"#bib21\">Haggarty et al., 2003</a>). To confirm that Hdac6 is a bona fide Tip60-p400-interacting protein, we performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments in ESCs, observing the Tip60-Hdac6 interaction no matter which protein was immunoprecipitated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Previously, both Hdac6 and Tip60 were separately found to interact with RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) in human CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2009</a>), raising the possibility that the Hdac6-Tip60 interaction we observed in ESCs might be mediated by Pol II. However, there were no peptides corresponding to Pol II in our LC-MS/MS data, and we could not detect Pol II in Tip60-H3F immunoprecipitates (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), arguing against this explanation. Furthermore, the Tip60-Hdac6 interaction was independent of DNA and resistant to high salt (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), verifying that Hdac6 is a stable interaction partner within Tip60-p400 complex. Finally, we tested whether Hdac6 interacts with Tip60-p400 complex in a differentiated cell type, MEFs. Unlike ESCs, Tip60-H3F immunoprecipitated from MEF nuclear extracts or whole cell lysates did not pull down Hdac6 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>), consistent with the possibility that Hdac6 interacts with Tip60-p400 complex in only a subset of cell types."

To address this issue, we first confirmed that Hdac6 exhibited significant nuclear localization in ESCs, in contrast to MEFs, in which Hdac6 was mainly cytoplasmic (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Next, we prepared cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions to examine the cellular localization of Hdac6 in ESCs and several adult cell types by Western blotting. Interestingly, while differentiated cells (MEFs, whole brain) exhibited the reported cytoplasmic sequestration, high levels of Hdac6 in undifferentiated cells, including ESCs, NSCs, and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPCs), were found in the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Consistent with these data, differentiation of either ESCs or NSCs caused a dramatic decrease in nuclear Hdac6, accompanied by increased Hdac6 within the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D</a>). To test whether nuclear localization of Hdac6 promoted its interaction with Tip60-p400 complex, we immunoprecipitated Tip60 from NSCs isolated from <i>Tip60-H3F</i> knock-in mice. Indeed, Hdac6 was present in Tip60-H3F immunoprecipitates from NSC nuclear extracts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These data suggest that the interaction of Hdac6 with Tip60-p400 in undifferentiated cells is lost during the course of differentiation of some types of stem cells, due to nuclear exclusion of Hdac6. However, cytoplasmic sequestration in differentiated cells cannot be the sole factor preventing Hdac6 from associating with Tip60-p400, since we did not observe Hdac6 within Tip60-H3F immunoprecipitates from MEF whole cell lysates (in which nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins are mixed; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Together, these data show that Hdac6 exhibits significant nuclear localization in some types of embryonic and adult stem and progenitor cells, where it associates with Tip60-p400 complex. Furthermore, stem cell differentiation promotes re-localization of Hdac6 to the cytoplasm, where it is sequestered away from Tip60-p400."

We therefore tested several human cancer cell lines and found that Hdac6 exhibited significant nuclear localization in each of the cell lines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). We further tested whether Tip60-p400 interacts with Hdac6 in cancer cells, by transfecting epitope-tagged <i>Tip60</i> and <i>Hdac6</i> constructs into 293.T cells (to facilitate immunoprecipitation), and found that Tip60 co-precipitated with Hdac6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), suggesting that, as with ESCs and NSCs, Hdac6 functions within Tip60-p400 complex in some cancer cells. Interestingly, loss-of-function of either <i>Hdac6</i> or genes encoding Tip60-p400 subunits within cancer cell lines has previously been shown to elicit defects in anchorage-independent growth and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents (<a href=\"#bib17\">Feng et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2012</a>), supporting this hypothesis. Finally, we asked whether re-localization of Hdac6 to the nucleus in cancer cells is an early event during transformation, at a time when it might be more likely to contribute to cancer progression. We found that shortly after introduction of SV40 large T antigen into MEFs, a large fraction of Hdac6 re-localized to the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), suggesting that nuclear localization of Hdac6 is an early event during transformation. Together, these data suggest that Hdac6 functions within Tip60-p400 complex in some types of cancer, and support the idea that stem cells and some cancer cells share several common phenotypes and regulatory pathways."

                                "text": "To test whether Hdac6 is necessary for gene regulation by Tip60-p400 complex in ESCs, we used DNA microarrays to examine the changes in mRNA levels upon <i>Tip60</i> or <i>Hdac6</i> KD. We observed highly correlated gene expression profiles in ESCs knocked down individually for <i>Tip60</i> and <i>Hdac6</i> (R = 0.63), suggesting a significant overlap in their sets of target genes, although <i>Hdac6</i> KD generally had weaker effects on expression of common targets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>). Next, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering of mRNA expression data comparing ESCs depleted of Tip60, Hdac6, or both to control KD ESCs. We observed four main clusters of genes differentially expressed in <i>Tip60</i> KD cells: genes upregulated upon <i>Tip60</i> KD but unaffected by <i>Hdac6</i> KD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, cluster 1), genes upregulated in both single KDs (cluster 2), genes downregulated in <i>Tip60</i> KD cells but unaffected by <i>Hdac6</i> KD (cluster 3), and genes downregulated in both single KDs (cluster 4). Genes downregulated upon <i>Tip60</i> KD were significantly overrepresented (relative to the number expected by chance) among Hdac6-independent Tip60 targets, while genes upregulated upon <i>Tip60</i> KD were significantly overrepresented among Hdac6-dependent target genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), suggesting that Tip60-dependent repression in ESCs usually requires Hdac6. Double KD of <i>Tip60</i> and <i>Hdac6</i> was nearly identical to the <i>Tip60</i> single KD, consistent with the model that Hdac6 functions within Tip60-p400 complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We next tested individual genes from each cluster by RT-qPCR, which generally confirmed the microarray results (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). We further validated these results using two <i>Hdac6</i> mutant ESC lines: one that harbors a hypomorphic allele that expresses reduced Hdac6 levels (<i>Hdac6</i><sup><i>reduced</i></sup>), and one that contains an <i>Hdac6</i> deletion (<i>Hdac6</i><sup><i>null</i></sup>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Both lines exhibited misregulation of Tip60/Hdac6 target genes similar to that observed upon <i>Hdac6</i> KD, with greater effects usually observed in the more severe <i>Hdac6</i><sup><i>null</i></sup> line (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Finally, we examined which classes of genes were enriched in each regulatory cluster. While Hdac6-independent targets of Tip60-p400 were enriched for genes involved in cellular growth, homeostasis, and the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, clusters 1 and 3), the majority of Hdac6-dependent Tip60-p400 target genes were differentiation-induced genes (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, cluster 2), consistent with the idea that Hdac6 is broadly important for Tip60-p400-dependent repression of developmental genes, although it also plays a smaller role in the activation of some Tip60-dependent proliferation genes (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, cluster 4)."

                                "text": "Despite overlapping roles in gene regulation, the function of Hdac6 within Tip60-p400 complex remained unclear. Hdac6 is not thought to bind chromatin or regulate gene expression in most cell types (<a href=\"#bib48\">Verdel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hubbert et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Haggarty et al., 2003</a>), therefore we considered the possibility that Hdac6 modulates Tip60-p400 function prior to chromatin binding by the complex. To determine whether Hdac6 associates with chromatin-bound Tip60-p400, we tested whether Hdac6 co-localizes with Tip60-p400 on chromatin. To this end, we examined the genome-wide distributions of Tip60 and Hdac6 in ESCs using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing of the precipitated DNA (ChIP-seq). To facilitate these analyses, we generated an ESC line in which the H3F tag utilized above was fused to the C-terminus of Hdac6 at the endogenous <i>Hdac6</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This line allowed us to directly compare the genomic binding profiles of Tip60 and Hdac6 with untagged control cells using the same antibody, thereby eliminating differences in background."

This two peak pattern of Tip60 binding and the gene set bound by Tip60 were very similar to previous mapping data examining the distribution of the p400 subunit of Tip60-p400 complex in ESCs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fazzio et al., 2008a</a>). Interestingly, we found that while Hdac6 was also enriched at p400- (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>) and Tip60-target genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) near their TSSs, its pattern of binding at each gene was somewhat different, forming one peak of enrichment at approximately 100 base pairs downstream of the TSS that overlapped with the downstream Tip60 peak (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). Like p400 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fazzio et al., 2008a</a>), we found that Hdac6 was enriched at genes marked by H3K4me3, including bivalent genes also marked by H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, we found that, on average, Hdac6 and Tip60 were both enriched to significantly higher levels at the promoter regions of genes that are misregulated upon <i>Hdac6</i> or <i>Tip60</i> KD compared to the genes unaffected by KD of these factors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), suggesting that many of these genes are direct targets. Interestingly, while the levels of Hdac6 binding were elevated at genes from clusters 2 and 4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), whose expression levels are regulated by Hdac6, they were also elevated at cluster 3 genes, whose expression levels are Tip60-dependent but Hdac6-independent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), suggesting that Tip60-p400 acts independently of Hdac6 to activate these genes. Together, these data show that Hdac6 binds in an asymmetrical pattern with respect to the transcription start site at its genomic targets. In addition, the overlap between Hdac6 and one of the two peaks of Tip60-p400 binding is consistent with a model in which Hdac6 functions within chromatin-bound Tip60-p400 complex to regulate common target genes in ESCs. Consistent with our finding that Hdac6 does not interact with Tip60-p400 in differentiated cells, we found that Hdac6-dependent Tip60-target genes in ESCs were not bound by Tip60 in MEFs (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

First, we considered the possibility that Hdac6 was necessary for complex formation or stability. To test this model, we purified Tip60-H3F in control and <i>Hdac6</i> KD ESCs, but found that the composition of Tip60-p400 complex was similar in the presence or absence of Hdac6 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), arguing against this explanation. Alternatively, Hdac6 might be necessary for localization of Tip60-p400 to its target genes in ESCs. Finally, Tip60-p400 may recruit Hdac6 to its target genes, where it regulates gene expression by deacetylating histones. To distinguish between these latter two possibilities, we performed a series of experiments. First, we tested whether the treatment of ESCs with tubastatin A (TubA), a chemical inhibitor that prevents Hdac6-dependent deacetlyation by binding within the catalytic channel of Hdac6\u2019s deacetylase domains (<a href=\"#bib5\">Butler et al., 2010</a>), had similar effects on gene expression as <i>Hdac6</i> KD. Like <i>Hdac6</i> KD or <i>Tip60</i> KD ESCs, most target genes were de-repressed upon TubA treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), consistent with the possibility that histone deacetylation by Hdac6 was necessary for repression of its gene targets. TubA treatment did not affect expression or nuclear localization of Hdac6 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that it acts directly on the Hdac6 deacetylase domains."

ChIP-qPCRs using antibodies recognizing histone H4 acetylated at all four N-terminal lysines or acetylated lysine-5 of histone H2A were performed in control, <i>Tip60</i> KD, and <i>Hdac6</i> KD ESCs. Surprisingly, like <i>Tip60</i> KD, <i>Hdac6</i> KD resulted in a decrease in both H4 and H2A acetylation at most shared targets of Tip60 and Hdac6 that were examined (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These findings show that Hdac6 does not silence differentiation genes by counteracting Tip60-dependent histone acetylation, despite the fact that treatment with TubA resulted in gene expression changes similar to <i>Hdac6</i> KD. <i>Hdac6</i> KD had no significant effect on bulk histone H4 acetylation, although tubulin acetylation was strongly enhanced by <i>Hdac6</i> KD (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), consistent with a model in which Hdac6 is required for Tip60 function only at common target promoters."

We tested this possibility by Western blotting Tip60-p400 complex purified from control or <i>Hdac6</i> KD ESCs with an antibody specific for acetyl-lysine, but we did not observe detectable acetylation of any subunit in either KD (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Additionally, we performed mass spectrometry on p400, the most highly acetylated subunit in Tip60-p400 complex (<a href=\"#bib9\">Choudhary et al., 2009</a>), purified from control or Hdac6 KD ESCs, but did not observe any notable differences in acetylation levels (data not shown). Thus, while the loss of <i>Hdac6</i> function does not lead to an observable increase in acetylation of Tip60-p400 complex or histone tails, it does lead to de-repression of Tip60-p400 target genes. Next, we considered the possibility that Hdac6 binds Tip60-p400 through one or both of its deacetylase domains. In this scenario, despite the fact that Hdac6 does not appear to deacetylate Tip60-p400, TubA could cause de-repression of Tip60- and p400-target genes simply by preventing Hdac6 from binding Tip60-p400. We tested this possibility by immunoprecipitating Tip60-p400 complex from <i>Tip60-H3F</i> ESCs treated with either vehicle alone or TubA and determining whether Hdac6 co-precipitates with Tip60. Interestingly, TubA treatment completely abolished Hdac6 association with Tip60-p400 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

In contrast, if Hdac6 deacetylates some unknown protein, which then activates it to bridge the interaction of Hdac6 with Tip60-p400, the treatment of cells with TubA should disrupt the Hdac6 interaction with Tip60-p400, while in vitro TubA treatment of Tip60-p400 complex should not disrupt the Hdac6 interaction. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we immunoprecipitated Tip60-p400 from untreated <i>Tip60-H3F</i> ESCs and, after washing unbound proteins away from beads, subjected them to five additional washes with or without TubA. After harvesting the protein eluted in the TubA washes or remaining bound to beads, we examined the distribution of Hdac6 by Western blotting. Interestingly, we found that the TubA washes removed a large fraction of Hdac6 from bead-bound Tip60-p400 complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), suggesting that TubA directly disrupts the interaction of Hdac6 with Tip60-p400, rather than preventing deacetylation of histones or other proteins. Consistent with these findings, we found that mutation of the Hdac6 deacetylase domains had the same effect as TubA treatment: mutation of deacetylase domain 1 partially disrupted Hdac6\u2019s interaction with Tip60-p400 in ESCs, while mutation of both deacetylase domains abolished this interaction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Together, these data indicate that Hdac6 interacts with Tip60-p400 via its deacetylase domains and that TubA directly disrupts this interaction."

We tested this possibility by comparing Tip60 enrichment in control KD and <i>Hdac6</i> KD ESCs, predicting that if Hdac6 is necessary for Tip60-p400 recruitment, <i>Hdac6</i> KD should result in diminished Tip60 enrichment at many of its target genes. We observed a striking difference in Tip60 binding upon <i>Hdac6</i> KD compared to control cells: Tip60 enrichment downstream of the TSS was strongly reduced at many target genes in <i>Hdac6</i> KD ESCs, along with a modest decrease in enrichment upstream of the TSS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>). Importantly, the reduction of Tip60 binding upon <i>Hdac6</i> KD was most severe at genes whose expression is regulated by Tip60-p400, compared to genes not regulated by the complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In contrast to Tip60\u2019s requirement for Hdac6, <i>Tip60</i> KD had no effect on Hdac6 localization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

In contrast, while deletion of <i>Hdac6</i> in ESCs was reported to cause a defect in colony formation, as well as a slight proliferation defect, <i>Hdac6</i> KO ESCs could nonetheless continue to self-renew (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>), and mice derived from <i>Hdac6</i> KO ESCs are viable. However, it was unclear from previous reports whether <i>Hdac6</i> KO or KD might result in impaired ESC differentiation in vitro, similar to that of <i>Tip60</i> KD. To test this possibility, we first confirmed that <i>Hdac6</i> KD ESCs exhibited colony formation and proliferation defects similar to those described for <i>Hdac6</i> KO ESCs. Indeed, we observed a significant decrease in colony formation and size in both <i>Hdac6</i> KD and <i>Tip60</i> KD ESCs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Furthermore, <i>Hdac6</i> KD ESCs had a small but reproducible decrease in proliferation rate, while <i>Tip60</i> KD caused a somewhat more severe proliferation defect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fazzio et al., 2008a</a>). Next, we tested whether EB formation or cellular differentiation might be impaired upon <i>Hdac6</i> KD, as we previously observed upon KD of genes encoding known Tip60-p400 subunits <i>Tip60</i>, <i>p400</i>, or <i>Dmap1</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fazzio et al., 2008a</a>). EBs are thought to roughly mimic the embryonic state, as cells proliferate within spherical aggregates that subsequently develop cystic structures and differentiate into cells from all three germ layers (<a href=\"#bib38\">Martin and Evans, 1975</a>). Indeed we found that, similar to <i>Tip60</i> KD ESCs, <i>Hdac6</i> KD ESCs formed EBs that were significantly smaller and more heterogeneous than control KD ESCs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Furthermore, both <i>Hdac6</i> and <i>Tip60</i> KD EBs exhibited delayed induction of several differentiation markers during a time course of ESC differentiation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Thus, while <i>Hdac6</i> loss results in only modest phenotypes in self-renewing ESCs, it is necessary for normal EB formation and cellular differentiation in vitro, consistent with its role in Tip60-p400 recruitment to differentiation genes."

Hdac6 has well established deacetylase activity directed against several cytoplasmic proteins, most notably tubulin (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hubbert et al., 2002</a>), leaving open the possibility that, in stem cells, it may deacetylate some nuclear protein(s) that remain to be discovered."

Consistent with the phenotypes shared by <i>Hdac6</i> KD and <i>Tip60</i> KD ESCs, both <i>Hdac6</i> KD and loss-of-function mutations of Tip60-p400 subunits were previously shown to impair anchorage-independent growth and increase DNA damage sensitivity in cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Feng et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wang et al., 2012</a>).

Since Hdac6 is only partially required for Tip60-p400 function in ESCs, the levels to which Tip60 and Hdac6 target genes are misregulated within the ICM of Hdac6<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> embryos may not be severe enough to induce a developmental arrest.

In addition, these studies lend support to the idea that different types of stem cells, as well as some cancer cells, share common features of chromatin structure that allow them to maintain their developmental potency, and provide one possible mechanistic link underlying this commonality. Re-localization of Hdac6 to the cytoplasm during stem cell differentiation could lead to expression of an alternate set of Tip60-p400 target genes. Conversely, after Hdac6 is restored to the nucleus upon cellular transformation, it may re-direct Tip60-p400 to a subset of its target genes that are normally stem cell-specific, potentially eliciting changes in gene expression that promote cancer development."

The paper shows that Hdac6 behaves differently in stem cells (and some de-differentiated cancer cells) by being nuclear and interacting with the Tip60-p400 complex. This interaction with the Tip60-p400 complex, which is surprisingly mediated by the histone deacetylase domain, is necessary for Hdac6 to recruit the Tip60-p400 complex to selected promoters and inhibit transcription. Biologically, this interaction is important for stem cell differentiation. Overall, this paper reports surprising findings, breaks new ground both with respect to histone acetylase and deacetylase complexes in a context related to stem cells. The experiments are well done, the results and conclusions convincing, and the paper well written. The manuscript is essentially accepted, but please look at the comments below and make any modifications that you wish. The paper does not need to be re-reviewed."
