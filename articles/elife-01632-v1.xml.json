However, our understanding of how histone modifications directly affect chromatin function remains limited. In this study, we investigate acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 64 (H3K64ac), a previously uncharacterized acetylation on the lateral surface of the histone octamer. We show that H3K64ac regulates nucleosome stability and facilitates nucleosome eviction and hence gene expression in vivo. In line with this, we demonstrate that H3K64ac is enriched in vivo at the transcriptional start sites of active genes and it defines transcriptionally active chromatin. Moreover, we find that the p300 co-activator acetylates H3K64, and consistent with a transcriptional activation function, H3K64ac opposes its repressive counterpart H3K64me3. Our findings reveal an important role for a histone modification within the nucleosome core as a regulator of chromatin function and they demonstrate that lateral surface modifications can define functionally opposing chromatin states."

However, our understanding of how histone modifications directly affect chromatin function remains limited. In this study, we investigate acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 64 (H3K64ac), a previously uncharacterized acetylation on the lateral surface of the histone octamer. We show that H3K64ac regulates nucleosome stability and facilitates nucleosome eviction and hence gene expression in vivo. In line with this, we demonstrate that H3K64ac is enriched in vivo at the transcriptional start sites of active genes and it defines transcriptionally active chromatin. Moreover, we find that the p300 co-activator acetylates H3K64, and consistent with a transcriptional activation function, H3K64ac opposes its repressive counterpart H3K64me3. Our findings reveal an important role for a histone modification within the nucleosome core as a regulator of chromatin function and they demonstrate that lateral surface modifications can define functionally opposing chromatin states."

These experiments showed that this site tends to be acetylated when a nearby gene is active, and to be unmodified or methylated when this gene is not active. It appears that the addition of the acetyl group makes this region of the chromatin less stable: this, in turn, makes it easier for the chromatin to be unpacked, thus giving access to the enzymes that transcribe the DNA and allowing transcription to take place. The work of Di Cerbo et al. shows that methylation and acetylation at the same site within a histone can define two opposing states of chromatin and DNA: an active state and a repressive state."

Four core histones\u2014H3, H4, H2A, and H2B\u2014comprise the nucleosomal core particle, and each may be decorated with multiple covalent modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kouzarides, 2007</a>). To date, most attention has focused on modifications within the flexible N-terminal tails of histones, which extend from their own nucleosome. Due to their accessibility, \u2018reader\u2019 or effector proteins selectively bind to modified sites in the tails to mediate downstream effects. In this way \u2018readers\u2019 can provide a relatively simple mechanism enabling cells to decipher the so-called \u2018histone-code\u2019, to facilitate the regulation of biological processes such as transcription, DNA replication, and damage repair."

This antibody specifically detects endogenous acetylated histone H3 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) and recognizes a K64-acetylated peptide with a high degree of specificity (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013E</a>) compared to other H3 acetylated lysines. Its recognition of H3 was efficiently competed by the immunizing peptide, but not by other peptides containing acetylated, methylated, or unmodified histone regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>). Furthermore, limited tryptic digestion of native nucleosomes, which removes the H3 tails whilst leaving the DNA-protected H3 core region largely intact, confirmed the antibody\u2019s specificity. Indeed, this digestion treatment resulted in the loss of signal for the tail modifications, such as H3K9ac, H3K18ac, and H3K27ac. In contrast, the truncated H3 core was still recognized by the H3K64ac antibody at levels comparable to the undigested H3 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2G</a>)."

Upon HDAC-inhibitor treatment, H3K64 acetylation levels increased (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2I</a>). Immunofluorescence (IF) showed a distinct nuclear localization of H3K64ac with a relative depletion from heterochromatin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, compare panels 5 and 6, and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2H</a>). Interestingly, this localization pattern is the opposite to that of H3K64me3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We previously established that H3K64me3 is a novel repressive mark enriched in pericentromeric heterochromatin that might help to \u2018lock\u2019 the conformation and/or position of the nucleosome, and consequently the surrounding chromatin (<a href=\"#bib10\">Daujat et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lange et al., 2013</a>)"

In line with the euchromatic localization detected in IF, we found strong enrichment of H3K64ac at the transcriptional start site (TSS) of active genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). At TSSs, we detected a strong correlation between the enrichment of H3K64ac and RNA Polymerase II occupancy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), as well as with the presence of active histone marks (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), suggesting a role for H3K64ac in transcriptional activation. Of note, local H3K64ac enrichment is indicative of the steady-state mRNA level of the respective gene (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and it is not simply due to increased histone H3 density (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Consistent with this, H3K64ac enrichment is anti-correlated with repressive marks such as H3K27me3 and H3K64me3 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Furthermore, we find H3K64ac strongly enriched at enhancers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), with a preference for active enhancers, where it co-localizes with established enhancer marks such as H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and p300-binding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Creyghton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</a>). Multiple single gene validations by ChIP-qPCR confirmed the genome-wide data and also revealed that H3K64ac levels are very low at repetitive elements (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>), where H3K64me3 is highly enriched (<a href=\"#bib10\">Daujat et al., 2009</a>), again indicating opposing genomic localizations for these two marks."

We analysed five imprinting control regions (ICRs) and in each case we found that the transcriptionally active alleles were specifically enriched in H3K64ac, whereas the inactive ones were enriched in H3K64me3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

To investigate this, we produced recombinant histone H3 acetylated on K64 in <i>Escherichia coli</i> using site-specific genetically directed incorporation of acetyl-lysine (<a href=\"#bib35\">Neumann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). To address effects on chromatin remodelling, we incubated H3K64ac and unmodified nucleosomes with two different chromatin remodelers belonging to two different Snf2 subfamilies, Chd1 and RSC (<a href=\"#bib15\">Flaus et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>). Our results show that Chd1 repositioned H3K64-acetylated nucleosomes faster than unmodified nucleosomes. This was not the case when we used the RSC enzyme (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This suggests that acetylation of H3K64 could differentially affect remodelling enzymes. Next, we sought to investigate whether H3K64ac also impacts on passive fluctuations in nucleosome structure and interrogated whether H3K64ac affects the stability of DNA association with histone octamers within nucleosomes. To do this, we attached fluorescent dyes to specific sites on the DNA, 35 bp from each end of the nucleosomal DNA, and performed FRET measurements (<a href=\"#bib35\">Neumann et al., 2009</a>). Using this strategy, we observed that the FRET interaction for H3K64ac nucleosomes was more sensitive to salt-disruption than unmodified nucleosomes at NaCl concentrations ranging between \u223c0.5 M and 1.0 M (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In parallel, we also measured the salt-dependent nucleosome stability by single-molecule FRET, which again resulted in a lower stability of H3K64ac nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Together these data demonstrate a decreased stability of H3K64ac nucleosomes, distinguishing this acetylation from H3K56ac that was reported not to significantly affect nucleosome stability under comparable conditions (<a href=\"#bib35\">Neumann et al., 2009</a>)."

To address whether H3K64ac affects the affinity of histone\u2013DNA binding, we performed competitive nucleosome reconstitution assays (<a href=\"#bib52\">Th\u00e5str\u00f6m et al., 2004</a>). <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> shows that H3K64ac reduces the level of nucleosome assembly, relative to unmodified H3, indicating that H3K64 acetylation reduces histone\u2013DNA binding affinity. In contrast, acetylation at H3K9 had no detectable effect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), illustrating functional differences between acetylation of lateral surface and histone tail lysines. In concert, these observations demonstrate that H3K64ac directly influences histone\u2013DNA association and nucleosome stability. This could provide a mechanistic explanation as to why H3K64ac is found in vivo at sites where increased nucleosome mobility/instability is required, such as the TSS of active genes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Segal et al., 2006</a>)."

In mammalian elongating spermatids, histones are initially replaced by the transition proteins and then by protamines (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gaucher et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">2012</a>). In spermatocytes and round spermatids H3K64ac was below the limit of detection. However, the levels of H3K64ac dramatically increased in elongating spermatids (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). At approximately the same time, we also detected the presence of some specific H3 tail acetylations (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). Notably, we observed this increase in H3K64ac precisely during the period of nucleosome disassembly and replacement of histones by transition proteins in spermiogenesis. Our present data suggest a potential role for lateral surface modifications, such as H3K64ac, in this replacement process by creating a less stable, more \u2018open\u2019 chromatin state. In contrast to this, H3K64me3 is enriched in the part of the spermatid where genomic regions that undergo late histone replacement are located, suggesting that H3K64me3 may \u2018stabilize\u2019 particular regions of chromatin thereby protecting them from histone exchange (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>)."

This could explain at least in part how H3K64ac can directly impact on nucleosome stability at active promoters and is in line with our observation that H3K64ac is associated with regions of the genome that are transcriptionally active or require histone exchange/turnover. Of note, we detected equivalent binding of Nap1 to each of the H3 species used (unmodified, K64R, or K64ac) indicating that the observed difference in histone eviction is not due to differential Nap1 histone binding (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

In this setup, H3K64Q promoted the expression of certain genes, such as <i>c-fos</i>, <i>Egr1</i>, and <i>c-myc</i>, (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), above the levels obtained when assaying wildtype H3.3 or the acetylation-deficient H3.3K64R.

The main chain atoms of H3K64 are in direct contact with the DNA phosphate backbone and this places the H3K64 side chain close enough to potentially contact the DNA, with the average H3K64 side-chain nitrogen-to-DNA distance approximately 6.1 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5A,B</a>). Lysine acetylation results in increased bulk and charge neutralization of the lysine side-chain, and it is likely that acetylation of lateral surface lysines (e.g., H3K64) could interfere with histone\u2013DNA interactions. Interestingly, in the high-resolution crystal structure of the nucleosome (PDB 1KX5; <a href=\"#bib12\">Davey et al., 2002</a>) H3K64 is found to be involved in an extensive network of water-mediated hydrogen bonds that link numerous water molecules, histone side- and main-chain atoms and the DNA (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5C</a>). Acetylation of H3K64 would be predicted to disrupt this hydrogen bond network. Davey et al. estimate from their crystallographic analysis that water-bridged interactions between histones and DNA are as important to nucleosome stability as the direct histone\u2013DNA contacts (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davey et al., 2002</a>). These water-bridges provide a plasticity that allows the histone core to adapt to myriad variations in the DNA sequence and conformation. They postulate that disruption of even a single water\u2013bridge interaction (e.g., acetylation of H3K64) has the potential to significantly affect nucleosome stability. This is indeed fully supported by our findings\u2014we demonstrate that H3K64ac exerts a direct effect on nucleosome stability and facilitates histone eviction."

                        "text": "H3K64 acetylation could cause the reduced FRET signal we observed in the salt-dependent dissociation assay in multiple ways. A pre-requisite for the loss of histones from the nucleosome is the dissociation of DNA from the surface of the histone octamer. Given the proximity of H3K64ac to DNA it is likely that it may facilitate this dissociation. This loss of histone\u2013DNA contacts caused by H3K64ac may aid the loss of H2A\u2013H2B dimers, contributing to the observed change in FRET signal. Alternatively, following the loss of H2A\u2013H2B dimers H3K64ac may favour dissociation of DNA from histones H3 and H4, or H3K64ac may affect water-mediated hydrogen bonds that directly influence the association of H2A\u2013H2B dimers. These modes of action are not mutually exclusive and they are consistent with the observed effects of H3K64ac in chromatin assembly in vitro. They also all have the potential to influence chromatin organization during cycles of assembly/disassembly at gene regulatory elements. We detect an approximately 60 mM decrease in the salt-dependent stability between H3K64ac and unmodified/H3K9ac nucleosomes. This difference in salt stability of H3K64ac appears to be in a range consistent with the observed changes in nucleosome dynamics. <a href=\"#bib18\">Gansen et al. (2013)</a> showed that simultaneous acetylation of all sites in H3 results in a decrease in nucleosome salt stability of approximately 100\u2013130 mM NaCl. Furthermore, a fundamental change in the histone content of the nucleosome via incorporation of the histone H2A variant H2A.Z, increases salt stability by up to \u223c70 mM (<a href=\"#bib39\">Park et al., 2004</a>). Moreover, the observed enrichment of H3K64ac at active gene promoters and during chromatin reorganization in spermiogenesis argues for a role of H3K64ac in creating an open, permissive chromatin state. Indeed, this is supported by increased histone eviction and the finding that a mutation mimicking constitutive acetylation, H3K64 to Q, can promote transcription of at least certain genes. We consider a twofold higher transcription due to a single histone mutation as biologically important."

Consequently, we prefer a model in which it acts via direct effects. However, H3K64ac may also function by preventing H3K64me3 from being laid down at key genomic regions. We have previously suggested that methylation of H3K64 is involved in the creation of repressive chromatin states (<a href=\"#bib10\">Daujat et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lange et al., 2013</a>). Thus, H3K64ac might serve to prevent the nucleosome from adopting a repressive conformation, thereby maintaining chromatin in a transcriptionally competent state. Our working model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) proposes that opposing chromatin states can be defined via the mutually exclusive presence of H3K64ac or H3K64me3. This model is reinforced by the observed distinct and largely mutually exclusive genomic distribution patterns of these two H3K64 modifications."

Upper and lower plateaus for each titration were used to normalise the data on a scale from 1\u20130. The plateau values were calculated by fitting the raw data using the sigmoid function described below in Microcal Origin 8.6 Software. Average titration curves were calculated from normalised data from three separate titrations (using different nucleosome reconstitutions) for unmodified and acetylated nucleosomes and fit again with the sigmoid function to determine the average NaCl concentration at which the normalised qF (qF<sub>norm</sub>) is 0.5 (<sub>C0.5</sub>):"

A mastermix containing all components except the tetramer was assembled, split into separate reaction tubes, and the required amount of concentration-matched unmodified/acetylated tetramer added. This was to ensure the maximum amount of consistency between the reactions. The NaCl concentration was then decreased by addition of 1\u00d7 TE 0.1 mM DTT to give concentrations of 1.5, 1.0, 0.75, 0.6, and 0.4 M, with sufficient time given for the reactions to equilibrate at each NaCl concentration (15\u201330 min). Once reactions had reached 0.4 M NaCl they were split into two separate microdialysis buttons and dialysed against 1\u00d7 TE 0.1 mM DTT for several hours to reduce the NaCl to 0 M. The reactions were split in two to assess variability during dialysis; however, we found they did not vary by more than 3%. The reactions were then mixed with sucrose to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and run on 0.2\u00d7 TBE 6% native polyacrylamide gels run at 200 V for 75 min at 4\u00b0C. Reactions using unmodified and acetylated tetramer were always set up side-by-side. The data are the average of three different batches of assembly reactions performed on different days. Band intensities were quantified in AIDA software.

Additional measurement allowed us to estimate a background signal of 0.2 kHz in all channels, 4% crosstalk, and a \u03b3-factor of 0.7, as a correction factor for differences in the quantum yields of the dyes and the wavelength-dependent detection efficiencies of the setup. Measures of the higher FRET efficiency corresponded to the fraction of intact nucleosomes at the respective salt concentration. These values were normalized to the higher FRET efficiency value at 0 mM NaCl to allow comparison between unmodified and acetylated nucleosomes.

Chromatin templates containing unmodified H3, H3K64ac, or H3K64R were assembled on an \u223c680-bp linear DNA fragment labeled with biotin on the 5\u2032 end. Chromatin was assembled using the salt dilution method as described in <a href=\"#bib23\">Gutierrez et al.

Each dilution step was carried out at 4\u00b0C, 400 RPM, for 45 min. Assembled chromatin was analysed on native 5% polyacrylamide gel run in 0.2\u00d7 TBE for 90 min at 150 V.

Then, a mixture of radioactive <sup>3</sup>H-acetyl-CoA and 100 \u00b5M cold acetyl-CoA was added to the samples and incubated for 40 min at 30\u00b0C. Before this last incubation, each reaction was supplemented with 1 \u00b5g of a supercoiled plasmid, on which the evicted octamers are assembled by Nap1. The supernatant fraction was recovered and assayed in western blot for total H3 amounts. The bound fraction was washed three times and analysed on SDS-PAGE for p300 specific activity onto chromatin."

This residue, located on the outer (lateral) surface of the histone octamer, is close to the DNA within the nucleosome structure and is thus potentially interesting because its acetylation may disrupt the nucleosome in a manner similar to that caused by H3K56ac. H3K64ac was identified by mass spec and found to be present in mice and humans (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Genome-wide analyses revealed that H3K64ac correlated with enhancers as well as active promoters (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a>). Acetylation of H3K64 appears to be performed largely, but not necessarily exclusively, by p300/CBP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Acetylation of H3K64 may cause a slight destabilization of nucleosomes at NaCl concentrations greater than 0.35 M (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The localization of H3K64ac during spermatogenesis was also examined (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> addresses, somewhat incompletely, the possible role of H3K64ac in histone eviction and transcription."

In a manner similar to other acetylation marks in H3, H3K64ac is found in transcriptionally active chromatin. H3K64ac may destabilize nucleosome stability and facilitate transcription. The main strengths of this work are the identification of H3K64ac, the prominent role of p300/CBP in acetylating H3K64, and the association of H3K64ac with active chromatin. Two key concerns are the specificity of the H3K64ac antibodies and the abundance of H3K64ac relative to H3K18ac and H3K27ac, which are also generated by p300/CBP. The functional studies are also less convincing."

(2013)</a> showed that simultaneous acetylation of all sites in H3 results in a decrease in nucleosome salt stability of \u223c100-130 mM NaCl. Furthermore, <a href=\"#bib39\">Park et al. (2004)</a> showed that a fundamental change in the histone content of the nucleosome, the incorporation of the histone H2A variant H2A.Z, increases salt stability up to \u223c70 mM. It is well documented that H2A.Z significantly increases the stability/compaction of nucleosome arrays (Fan et al. 2002) and reduces transcription of chromatin templates in vitro (Zhou et al. 2007). Thus, the decrease in salt stability we observe for H3K64ac appears to be in a range consistent with real changes in nucleosome dynamics. This is also supported by our additional in vitro and in vivo data. Notably, not all core histone acetylations result in destabilised nucleosomes in vitro. For instance, <a href=\"#bib35\">Neumann et al. (2009)</a> reported that H3K56ac nucleosomes show no significant difference in salt stability relative to unmodified nucleosomes. Thus, the actual site of acetylation within the nucleosome seems important for its destabilisation rather than acetylation per se.

In the absence of AcCoA, p300 activity is impaired, and this leads to strong effects on histone eviction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). However, the pre-acetylated H3K64ac nucleosomes, due to their intrinsic higher instability are prone to easier eviction, which may occur to a low level even in the absence of AcCoA, supporting our model of destabilisation of nucleosomes by H3K64ac."

Nap1 is known to bind both H2A-H2B dimers and H3-H4 tetramers in vitro (Andrews et al. 2008). However, we have no evidence for full nucleosome formation upon/during eviction and the conclusion from this experiment is solely that H3K64ac promotes eviction of histone H3. To avoid confusion we have adapted the model accordingly, and now the scheme shows Nap1 binding independently the H3-H4 tetramer and H2A-H2B dimers. These tetramers and dimers can then be sequestered by Nap1 onto the supercoiled plasmid DNA in the supernatant."

As shown in new <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 2B</a>, Nap1 binds to the H3K64R mutant similarly to unmodified H3 or H3K64ac.

This 2-fold difference has been calculated relative to wt H3, which may still be acetylated at K64. We have now also included the transcriptional effects of the H3K64R mutant, which cannot be acetylated at K64. As expected the K64R mutant has a negative effect on transcription of the analysed genes and the fold difference in transcriptional levels between K64Q and K64R is, as expected, higher than the difference between K64Q and wt H3 (up to more than 3-fold). Furthermore, we reason that a two-fold difference in transcriptional levels is already known to be meaningful in a biological context. For example, in dosage compensation where it contributes to sex determination."

Nevertheless, the reviewer is correct to indicate that H2A/H2B dimers dissociate from nucleosomes at around 0.6 M NaCl. We are happy to consider that this event may play some role in the H3K64ac effect that we observe. Consequently, we now suggest that there are at least three ways by which H3K64 acetylation could affect the reduced FRET signal observed in the salt dependent dissociation assay."
