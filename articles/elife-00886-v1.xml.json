We found that the midgut shows striking regional differentiation along its anterior-posterior axis. At least ten distinct subregions differ in cell morphology, physiology and the expression of hundreds of genes with likely tissue functions. Stem cells also vary regionally in behavior and gene expression, suggesting that they contribute to midgut sub-specialization. Clonal analyses showed that stem cells generate progeny located outside their own subregion at only one of six borders tested, suggesting that midgut subregions resemble cellular compartments involved in tissue development. Tumors generated by disrupting Notch signaling arose preferentially in three subregions and tumor cells also appeared to respect regional borders. Thus, apparently similar intestinal stem cells differ regionally in cell production, gene expression and in the ability to spawn tumors."

This tissue is a long tube that is lined with two types of cells: digestive cells and hormone-producing cells. These cell types are maintained by thousands of apparently similar intestinal stem cells, and it has long been thought that the stem cells give rise to cells throughout the midgut by responding to the same set of signals. However, certain digestive processes\u2014such as the breakdown or uptake of particular nutrients\u2014are known to occur only in a specific portion of the intestine. For example, in fruit flies, a region in the middle of the intestine is acidified, and may act like an extra stomach. And in both fruit flies and mammals, iron is taken up mostly in the area of the gut just after the stomach. These regional differences in function have led to uncertainty over how midgut cells both arise and are replaced."

Each subregion appears to perform specific functions during digestion, and the cells in these subregions also transcribe genes that reflect their roles in breaking down or storing various nutrients. Interestingly, the stem cells in most subregions are distinct, and do not differentiate into the cells from adjacent subregions. The subregions also differ in their incidence of cancer: when a particular signal was inhibited in stem cells in all ten subregions, aggressive tumors formed in only three subregions and the tumor cells did not cross into neighboring subregions."

For example, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) of the adult Drosophila midgut (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</a>) generate the two major differentiated cell types of the gut, enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells, throughout life. ISCs with high levels of the Delta (Dl) ligand specify daughters to be enterocytes via unidirectional Notch signaling, while ISCs with low Delta levels specify enteroendocrine cell daughters (<a href=\"#bib31\">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2007</a>). Although, the exact nature of their niche remains unclear, ISCs are highly responsive to signals from neighboring cells. The animal\u2019s nutritional state, as sensed in part by insulin signaling, influences ISC division and whether divisions are symmetric or asymmetric (<a href=\"#bib8\">Choi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">O\u2019Brien et al., 2011</a>). Dietary toxins, pathogenic bacteria, or other stressors stimulate enterocytes to release Egfr and JAK/STAT ligands that trigger nearby stem cells to multiply and produce tissue hyperplasia (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib20\">Jiang and Edgar, 2011</a>)."

Whether these stem cells are precisely equivalent, however, has not been critically tested since most studies have focused on the posterior midgut, where ISC divisions are frequent. Some differences are plausible, since histological studies have long distinguished the middle midgut from the anterior and posterior segments. The middle midgut has an acidic pH, and is itself tripartite in organization. The anterior portion contains specialized enterocytes known as interstitial cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Filshie et al., 1971</a>), interspersed with morphologically distinctive \u2018copper cells\u2019, which selectively fluoresce following exposure to copper ions (<a href=\"#bib37\">Poulson and Bowen, 1952</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">McNulty et al., 2001</a>). There follows a zone of \u2018large flat cells\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Poulson and Waterhouse, 1960</a>) and an \u2018iron region\u2019 enriched in the iron-storage protein Ferritin (<a href=\"#bib38\">Poulson and Waterhouse, 1960</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Poulson and Bowen, 1952</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Mehta et al., 2009</a>). Copper cells depend uniquely on the homeotic gene <i>labial</i> during embryonic differentiation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Panganiban et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hoppler and Bienz, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dubreuil et al., 2001</a>) and function in acid production using vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump proteins localized on their apical membranes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dubreuil, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Shanbhag and Tripathi, 2009</a>). A recent study of ISCs in the copper region (<a href=\"#bib44\">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</a>) found that they are capable, like posterior ISCs, of replenishing all the major cell types, including copper, interstitial and enteroendocrine cells. However, copper region ISCs were reported to differ from posterior ISCs in lacking the Notch ligand Delta, and in being normally quiescent in the absence of stress (<a href=\"#bib44\">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</a>). Thus, the regulation of ISCs differs in the copper region compared to other studied regions of the midgut."

Some enzymes, such as the lipase Magro (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sieber and Thummel, 2012</a>), may be trafficked into the midgut from the proventriculus via the peritrophic matrix (<a href=\"#bib22\">King, 1988</a>). Others such as, \u03b1-amylase, which is expressed primarily in the anterior and posterior midgut regions (<a href=\"#bib48\">Thompson et al., 1992</a>) probably indicate true regional differences in enterocyte expression. Some of the strongest evidence for further regionalization comes from studies showing that unique neuropeptides are secreted by enteroendocrine cells located in specific gut regions (<a href=\"#bib34\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Veenstra et al., 2008</a>). These spatial differences in gene expression might be induced downstream of the ISC by region-specific signals, or they might reflect intrinsic differences in regional stem cell programming."

Each subregion displays a sharp boundary with its neighbors, suggesting that it carries out distinctive functions. ISCs likely contribute to these differences, since stem cells from most tested regions did not produce adjacent region cells even when located at the border. Regional stem cell differences likely influence tumorigenesis, since midgut tumors caused by attenuating Notch signaling arose at very different rates in the different subregions. Thus, tissue stem cells may comprise a wider variety of types, each with a more limited therapeutic scope, than previously appreciated."

Only, fertilized adult females 4\u201314 days of age were employed to avoid the final steps of gut maturation that take place in young adults (<a href=\"#bib45\">Takashima et al., 2013a</a>), as well as age-induced decline (<a href=\"#bib33\">O\u2019Brian et al., 2011</a>).

Ferritin-GFP selectively stained the Fe region, while Nile red, which stains lipid droplets, marked the A2, P1 and P3 zones (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), the same regions showing enterocytes with high lipid content in EM images.

The <i>labial (lab)</i> gene encodes a homeobox transcription factor that is only expressed in the copper cell region, where it is required for copper cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Panganiban et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hoppler and Bienz, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dubreuil et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</a>). The RNAseq data showed that labial reads were detected only within the middle midgut in experiments that divided the midgut into anterior (A1, A2 and A3), middle (Cu, LFC and Fe) or posterior (P1, P2, P3 and P4) sections. Revealingly, <i>lab</i> fpkm was 40\u2013100 times higher in isolated Cu region RNA than in any other adult midgut region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). All seven of the midgut segments we were able to isolate showed highly specific gene expression. CG10725 was enriched in A1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), along with many other genes involved in chitin metabolism, where it likely encodes a component of the peritrophic membrane. Although their levels of spatial specificity were not previously known, Beta-galactosidase (Gal) mRNA was selectively found in the A2-A3 sample, the ZIP1 iron transporter mRNA in the Fe region, and the CG3106 acyl transferase mRNA in P1. This high specificity proves that cross-contamination was minimal and that gene expression boundaries correspond to the regional boundaries used in tissue isolation, while the correspondence of the RNAseq data to previous studies of gene expression validates the reliability of this large new body of information."

These findings suggest several general insights into midgut function. Food entering the anterior midgut from the proventriculus begins to break down due to the action of enzymes expressed in the anterior midgut. In addition to digestive enzymes, anterior enterocytes may secrete other substances such as lipids to aid in nutrient solubilization. Antibacterial activity is also important in this region. In the three middle midgut regions food is further digested releasing sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, etc aided by the low pH. Additionally, metal ions that must be reduced before they can be absorbed, and other micronutrients are likely taken up for storage or metabolism. Finally, upon entry into the posterior midgut, nutrients begin to be massively absorbed by enterocytes and transported to other regions of the body for storage, modification or utilization. The lipid-rich zone in the P1 region probably represents such nutrient uptake. The large flux of ready-to-use nutrients in the posterior region may explain why their stem cells divide more rapidly than other regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4S</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</a>).

While it has been reported that heat shock can alter ISC division rates measured by lineage labeling (<a href=\"#bib44\">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</a>), we minimized these effects by using a single brief heat shock and a marking system that lacks GAL4. Moreover, all subregions should have been affected equally, and the data should be accurate as relative measurements. The most rapidly dividing ISCs are found in P1-P3, which divide about once per day, while ISC division is slightly less frequent in the anterior midgut, and much slower in the middle region. However, in contrast to a previous report (<a href=\"#bib44\">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</a>), Cu region ISCs were not entirely quiescent but divided regularly every 4\u20135 days. ISCs in different regions maintain differing numbers of enteroendocrine cells and enterocytes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4R</a>). Interestingly, in P1 (and to a lesser extent in P3 and A2), the enteroblast and even the youngest EC continued to stain for Dl (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L\u2032</a>). Although ISCs generated the same cells as elsewhere in the midgut, the persistent Delta in enteroblasts in the P1 region likely leads to persistent Notch activation during early enterocyte differentiation; the Notch activity reporter GbeSu(H)-lacZ was expressed in young ECs in P1 and P3, but not in other regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Q vs 4P</a>)."

In contrast, if regional differences are induced by signals received from the gut lumen, muscle, enteric nerves or other sources, then ISCs near a border should on occasion generate daughter cells from both regions. We noticed that clones in the midgut sometimes run for a considerable distance perpendicular to the a/p axis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), but rarely if ever parallel to the axis. To investigate quantitatively whether there are restrictions on cell movement and/or differentiation along the a/p axis, we marked stem cells at a relatively low frequency to avoid generating two adjacent clones derived from different regions. Progeny of individual clones were then analyzed with respect to particular regional boundaries defined using appropriate GAL4 lines or other region-specific markers. Among more than 3000 sparse clones generated throughout the midgut, we identified rare \u2018boundary clones\u2019 that contained a single stem cell, at least four total cells and that contacted a marked boundary from one side or the other. Each boundary clone was carefully analyzed by confocal microscopy so that the location of its stem cell (marked by Delta), the number, cell type and location of the downstream cells (marked by lacZ and DAPI) and their precise relationship to the boundary in question (marked by GFP) could be determined (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We then recorded clone size, the number of cells that contacted the boundary, and the number of cells, if any, that crossed the boundary and successfully differentiated into cells of the adjacent region as defined by regional marker expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). It was difficult to obtain large numbers of valid boundary clones due to the low rate of clone induction, regional differences in stem cell activity, and the difficulty of analyzing boundary clones accurately using different regional markers. However, we characterized 49 unambiguous boundary clones contacting six different regional boundaries (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

Either the clones did not cross the boundary, or they crossed but were unable to differentiate properly and rapidly died. Since the boundaries are not smooth or precisely perpendicular to the a/p axis at the cellular level, it is also possible that cells from an A1 stem cell that pushed into the anterior edge of the A2 zone simply caused a bulge in the boundary at that location (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,D\u2032</a>). Over time such cell movement might cause the boundary between the two regions to fluctuate slightly in shape as cells die and are replaced by cells from one side or the other. Similarly, clones failed to differentiate heterologously across four other studied boundaries (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), including Fe/P1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>) and P1/P2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J,K</a>).

We induced ISC clones and identified 17 boundary clones touching the LFC/Fe border, using Fe region-specific expression of Ferritin-GFP to mark the boundary. The behavior of clones at this boundary was very different than at A1/A2. 15 of 17 clones crossed the boundary, and did so readily from either direction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>). This was not an artifact of Ferritin-GFP expression because crossing was also observed using R46B08 to mark the LFC/Fe boundary, whereas clones failed to cross from Fe into P1 using Ferritin-GFP. Thus, despite the regional differences in enterocyte morphology and gene expression described earlier, the stem cells within LFC and Fe can each generate at least some cells characteristic of the other region. We concluded that our method efficiently identified clones that produced cells from two different regions across a boundary when such behavior occurred."

For example, 88% of boundary clones on the LFC/Fe boundary crossed and generated cells on the other side (N = 17). In comparison, 0% of boundary clones crossed the A1/A2 border (N = 6), 0% of boundary clones crossed the A3/Cu border (N = 3), 0% of boundary clones crossed the Cu/LFC border (N = 4), 0% of boundary clones crossed the Fe/P1 border (N = 7), and 0% of boundary clones crossed the P1/P2 border (N = 12). These differences are all statistically significant, since the probability that even three boundary clones would fail to cross a junction equivalent to the LFC/Fe boundary is only (1\u20130.88)<sup>3</sup> = 0.0017. To further test the significance of the results, we reasoned that there should be a correspondence between the number of boundary cells and the number of boundary-crossing cells, on average, in the absence of a constraint. In boundary clones at the LFC/Fe border, there were 0.63 crossing cells for every boundary cell (N = 115). In contrast, there were 0 crossing cells for 22 boundary cells at the A1/A2 border, 0 crossing cells for 14 boundary cells on the A3/Cu border, 0 crossing cells for 10 boundary cells on the Cu/LFC border, 0 crossing cells for 21 boundary cells on the Fe/P1 border, and 0 crossing cells for 53 boundary cells on the P1/P2 border. The absence of crossing cells differs significantly from expectation based on LFC/Fe (e.g., at the Cu/LFC border with ten boundary cells, p=0.014; \u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 6.15). However, the limited number of clones and boundary cells that could be obtained at the Cu/LFC and A3/Cu borders does limit our ability to detect cell crossing is inhibited in both directions. At the Cu/LFC border, Cu stem cell progeny cannot cross, but it is not possible to conclude that LFC progeny lack this capacity. The restriction at the A3/Cu border also is known to apply only from the A3 side. A summary of the compartmentalization of stem cell clones is shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>."

We investigated whether these tumors arise with the same frequency throughout the midgut by knocking down Notch signaling in ISCs and EBs using the esg-GAL4 driver, or by feeding flies the Notch inhibitor DAPT. Several days after reducing Notch activity, clusters of diploid tumor cells began to appear in the tissue. Surprisingly, tumorous cells arose and proliferated much more extensively in some midgut subregions than in others (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The P1 region consistently had the largest tumors and earliest onset, although tumors also arose rapidly in P3 and the posterior part of A2. In contrast, we never observed tumors within A1, even after long periods of exposure to these agents. As the tumor cells expanded they appeared to respect the cellular boundaries with adjacent midgut regions. For example, the anterior border of P1 tumor cells corresponded closely with the Fe/P1 boundary based on counts of cell diameters from the Cu region (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013E</a>). The posterior boundary of P1 tumor expansion mapped near or at the P1/P2 border (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), while the anterior and posterior boundaries of P3 tumors also corresponded with their normal junctions with P2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>) and P3/P4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). The same regional specificity was observed when Notch signaling was inhibited using N[RNAi], treatment with the Notch inhibitor DAPT, or by expressing a Notch-dominative negative allele N<sup>DN</sup>. These results indicate that regional epigenetic differences have a large effect on the development of midgut enteroendocrine tumors and that regional boundaries restrict tumor cell movement into adjacent tissue compartments."

At the levels of cell morphology, cell behavior and gene expression, the midgut is much more highly organized than a uniform cellular tube containing an acidic middle region or \u2018stomach\u2019. Regionalization likely supports the complex metabolic tasks carried out by the midgut. Ingested food goes through multiple intermediate stages during digestion and these steps may be most efficient if carried out in a controlled sequence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Some of these steps are associated with an array of bacterial species that constitute the normal intestinal microbiome (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ryu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Shin et al., 2011</a>).

Converting our counts of cell number within the 10 regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) to the fractional length coordinates used by <a href=\"#bib5\">Buchon et al.

In the midgut subregions surrounding five different boundaries, we did not detect a single stem cell that produced differentiated cells on the opposite side of the boundary, that is from a region different from the one in which it resided. All the \u2018non-crossing\u2019 clones contacted the regional boundary, and in 78% the founder stem cell was located on or within one cell of the boundary, such that progeny cells could have reached the adjacent region prior to differentiation. In contrast, boundary clones with the same general properties almost always crossed the LFC/Fe boundary, showing that \u2018non-crossing\u2019 behavior would not occur by chance. Consistent with the existence of epigenetic differences in stem cells that limit trans-regional differentiation, clones frequently pushed into adjacent regions at the boundary, but retained their autonomous identity based on marker expression. Mechanical and/or adhesive forces may also contribute to maintaining some regional boundaries. Indeed, the tendency of tumor cells to respect regional boundaries suggests that cell\u2013cell interactions at boundaries are likely to be important as well as stem cell programming."

In the developing Drosophila embryo and imaginal discs, the <i>engrailed</i> gene and <i>hedgehog</i> signaling play important roles in defining posterior compartments (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dahmann and Basler, 2000</a>). We did not detect expression of <i>engrailed</i> or the closely related gene <i>invected</i> in any midgut region, and expression of <i>hedgehog</i> pathway components was similar on both sides of non-crossing boundaries such as Fe/P1. Dorsal ventral compartments in the developing wing are mediated by <i>apterous</i> and by Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib28\">Milan and Cohen, 2003</a>). <i>Apterous</i> was expressed only at very low levels throughout all regions and <i>Serrate</i> was found at significant levels only in posterior regions 2\u20134 where the gene is dispensable for cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</a>). In the developing vertebrate brain, Hox genes are important in specifying developmental compartments (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kiecker and Lumsden, 2005</a>). However, Hox genes are only expressed at very low levels in endodermal cells during embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hoppler and Beinz, 1994</a>) and these genes were very weakly expressed in our RNAseq studies, perhaps due to expression in non-endodermal cells within these samples. Consequently, the genetic basis for adult midgut compartmentalization probably differs from previously studied examples of tissue regionalization."

In the embryonic and larval gut, <i>lab</i> is required for Cu cell specification, differentiation and maintenance (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hoppler and Beinz, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dubreuil et al., 2001</a>). The gene is expressed in copper cells, but not elsewhere in the larval midgut, and we observed similar specificity of <i>lab</i> expression in the adult. When <i>lab</i> is mis-expressed during embryonic development in other midgut regions, the copper region can expand (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hoppler and Bienz, 1994</a>). Endodermal cell identity along the a/p axis may be determined by signals from adjacent mesoderm during embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bilder and Scott, 1998</a>), and then fixed by the induction of secondary factors such as <i>lab</i>. Gene expression within the midgut muscles might play a similar role in the adult midgut, however, expression boundaries of muscle genes were frequently offset with respect to endodermal regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Whether this bears any relationship to the documented offset in homeotic gene expression between the ectoderm and visceral endoderm in embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lawrence and Morata, 1994</a>) remains unclear. A key question is whether individual or combinations of differentiation regulators analogous to <i>lab</i> specify other midgut subregions in which the ISCs fail to generate cells across regional boundaries. The RNAseq data should provide a valuable resource in identifying such factors. For example, one potential candidate, the homeotic gene <i>defective proventriculus (dve)</i>, functions in copper cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nakagawa et al., 2011</a>) and its expression was observed to fall sixfold between Fe and P1."

However, it is not known whether regions analogous to other eight midgut domains described here exist in larvae. The larval midgut contains nests of diploid intestinal precursors that proliferate following pupariation to build the adult gut and establish its ISCs (<a href=\"#bib19a\">Jiang and Edgar, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Mathur et al., 2010</a>). Larval midgut domains might serve as a template for adult regionalization if gut precursor cells within each region already differ autonomously and do not mix during pupal development. However, cells do cross boundaries between the hindgut and midgut during pupal gut development (<a href=\"#bib46\">Takashima et al., 2013b</a>). Identical regionalization within larval and adult guts might be disadvantageous to species with very different larval and adult diets, hence many adult midgut regions are likely to be established de novo or to be re-specified during pupal development."

Our studies raise the question of whether these tissues exhibit finer grained regional patterns of gene expression than has been previously recognized, patterns that might be supported by small autonomous differences in their stem cells. Currently, the strongest indication for such regionalization comes from studies of the intestine. Lineage labeling shows that similar stem cells expressing Lgr5 exist along the mammalian gut (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barker et al., 2007</a>) despite the fact that enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells and bacterial symbionts differ regionally (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rindi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bradley et al., 2011</a>). For example, iron absorption in mammals takes place primarily in the duodenum (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fuqua et al., 2012</a>), a specialized subregion of the small intestine located just downstream from the acidic stomach. This is similar to the position of the midgut iron region just downstream from the acid-producing parietal cells of the Cu and LFC regions. The antibacterial lectin RegIII\u03b3, which like Drosophila PGRPs recognizes bacterial peptidoglycans, is expressed most prominently in the distal region of the small intestine (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cash et al., 2006</a>). The existence of tissue and stem cell regionalization in other mammalian tissues deserves further detailed investigation."

Our studies suggest that regional differences in the properties of apparently similar stem cells and tissue cells contribute to such differences. The midgut zones most favorable for the expansion of Notch-deficient cells showed pre-existing differences in Notch signaling within the early enterocyte lineage. Delta expression did not decrease shortly after ISC division, as in other regions, and Notch signaling persisted throughout enterocyte development (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Q</a>). Curiously, same tumor-prone regions with persistent Notch signaling also were enriched in lipid droplets (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). At present it is not clear how the altered signaling, regional metabolic activity and tumor susceptibility are related. Additionally, regional differences in the microbiome, as suggested by our observation of domain-specific expression of PGRP proteins, may also influence the occurrence of cancer. Gastric bacteria such as <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> contribute to stomach cancer (<a href=\"#bib49\">Uemura et al., 2001</a>), while colonic <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> likely promote gut cell DNA damage and colon cancer (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wu et al., 2009</a>).

Will altering the expression of genes that normally differ between regions cause ISCs to generate cells with heterotypic characteristics?

A \u2018boundary cell\u2019 is any cell in the clone that neighbors midgut cell in a different subregion. A \u2018crossed cell\u2019 is any cell in the clone that is located past the boundary and that displays the marker expression of a midgut subregion different from that of its founder stem cell. A crossed clone is a clone that contains at least one crossed cell. Several classes of potentially ambiguous clones were not included in our tabulation to ensure accuracy. Clones lacking a single, clearly stained stem cell were excluded, as were clones that could not be accurately scored because they wrapped around the periphery of the squashed tissue. Additionally, clones touching regions where boundary marker expression could not be clearly scored were excluded. For each boundary clone, the total size, number of boundary-touching cells, number of crossed cells, if any, and the location of the ISC with respect to the border, was recorded."

The authors identify ten sub-regions based on differential gene expression, combining the expression patterns of GAL4 driver lines and RNA seq. of dissected segments of the gut. The data on regionalized expression is extensive and of good quality, and will be essential for future functional studies of regionalized gut functions in these different cell subtypes. The authors investigate whether the stem cells in all sub-regions are equivalent and demonstrate apparent lineage restricted compartment boundaries. They include some clonal analysis that reveals, potentially, the presence of clonal restriction boundaries that partition different subsets of stem cells. They observe that different regions of the gut are more susceptible to tumorigenesis upon inhibition of Notch signalling, suggesting regional differences in stem cell behavior. Although the authors have not addressed the mechanisms underlying these differences, documenting them is an important first step towards elucidating the mechanisms that control differential stem cell activity. Overall this is an impressive amount of work and will be useful for researchers working with this interesting system. It overlaps somewhat with recent \u201catlas\u201d type papers from Tripathi and Lemaitre, but has unique aspects and different gene expression and Gal4 databases, so it will serve to complement these other studies."

The conclusions drawn, though limited to these two boundaries, were valid and statistically sound. However, we agree with the reviewers\u2019 main points that these data were not presented in sufficient detail, and moreover that this aspect of the work should be expanded to encompass more boundaries. We have now addressed these issues. From more than 2000 additional clones we have characterized 25 more boundary clones contacting 4 additional boundaries. Interestingly, the clones do not cross any of these new boundaries. So, instead of one crossable boundary and one non-crossable boundary, we now show that clonal crossing is not observed at 5 of 6 boundaries. Thus, compartmentalization is the rule, not the exception, further enhancing the interest of these experiments."

This is true despite the difficulty of obtaining large numbers of boundary clones. For example, 88% of boundary clones on the LFC/Fe boundary cross to the other side (N = 17). In comparison, 0% of boundary clones on the A1/A2 border cross (N = 6), 0% of clones on the A3/Cu border cross (N = 3), 0% of clones on the Cu/LFC border cross (N = 4), 0% of clones on the Fe/P1 border cross (N = 7), and 0% of clones on the P1/P2 border cross (N = 12). Since the large clones analyzed almost always cross at LFC/Fe, and were of similar size and border touching characteristics in all regions (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), clonal behavior at the other boundaries is significantly different (even for N = 3, p=0.0017). Another way to demonstrate this significance is to note that for Cu/LFC, there are 0.63 crossing cells for every boundary cell (N = 115). In contrast, there are 0 crossing cells at A1/A2 border (N = 22), 0 crossing cells on the A3/Cu border (N = 14), 0 crossing cells on the Cu/LFC border (N = 10), 0 crossing cells on the Fe/P1 border (N = 21), and 0 crossing cells on the P1/P2 border (N = 53). All these numbers are significantly different from expectation based on LFC/Fe (e.g., even with N = 10 boundary cells, the chance of zero crossing cells is just p=0.014; \u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 6.15). However, the number of clones and boundary cells available does limit certain conclusions, and these are now spelled out in detail. For example, at the Cu/LFC border, it is not possible to conclude that the restriction applies in both directions, rather than just from Cu stem cells. The restriction at the A3/Cu border also is known to apply only from the A3 side. These limitations are indicated in the text and the diagram in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>."

It was not possible to exhaustively test every boundary because an appropriate GAL4 line demarking every boundary is not currently available, and scorable boundary clones arise at variable rates due to differences in stem cell activity and marker quality in the different subregions. However, we feel strongly that the clonal data presented, which represents a large amount of effort, establishes that in multiple regions of the midgut, cells are normally replaced only by the local ISCs from that region. This is further supported by the tumor data. It would be unreasonable to expect that the same paper that (co-)discovered the existence of midgut subregions, characterized them sufficiently to even contemplate such experiments, and established the existence of compartmentalization, would exhaustively analyze their clonal properties."

The many regional differences in transcription factor expression that we uncovered may help explain this regional specificity, as has been documented already for labial and the Cu region.

Most of the claims that heat shock induces artifacts (e.g., <a href=\"#bib44\">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</a>) are based on cell marking systems that involve the GAL4 system, which is itself affected by heat. The artifact may be the effect of heat shock on such marking systems rather than on the gut; e.g., a transient heat-induced increase in GAL4 activity could cause extra flip-out cell marking. Our experiments used a simple, reliable marking system that does not involve GAL4, has zero-background and is inactive in postmitotic cells; we applied only a single brief heat shock. Moreover, our interest here is primarily in documenting the <i>relative</i> differences in ISC activity between subregions, which were all treated the same. We now mention heat shock as an issue and so qualify our experiment. However, we believe that these data remain important and valuable as another way to document subregional differences."

Consequently, we have added a text section in the revised Discussion that briefly compares the two analyses of midgut regionalization. Based on our reading of their paper, the two studies are in fairly close but not complete agreement. We highlight the few differences, such as the nature and importance of the constrictions. Buchon, et al. (2013) present two of them as mini-regions in their own right lying between the other regions, whereas we locate the constrictions as features (caused mostly likely by overlying muscle) lying within or spanning regions whose cells directly contact each other. We sought to maintain the previously published regional names as much as possible, in order to facilitate access to the earlier literature, which goes back to the 1950s. Buchon, et al. (2013) renamed all regions based on the idea that the constrictions are the truly fundamental landmarks. In the end, the differences between the regions defined by the two groups are small, and workers in the field will decide which terms are most appropriate and useful."
