Indirect defenses are widespread and include domatia, extrafloral nectar, and food bodies which provide shelter and nutrition for predators and parasitoids, as well as herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) which convey information about feeding herbivores (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heil, 2008</a>).

Experimental additions of pure volatiles or mixes to plants growing in nature has worked well to test short-term effects of specific compounds (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</a>), but only endogenously produced HIPV emissions can ensure specific, lasting and consistent differences under field conditions. Most evidence for the utility of HIPVs comes from studies in which predators and parasitoids learn to associate HIPVs with prey; na\u00efve predators and parasitoids are just as likely to respond to HIPVs as not to respond (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allison and Hare, 2009</a>). Thus the inducibility of HIPV emission, which ensures association with herbivore feeding, is likely essential for HIPV function, but it is difficult to engineer (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kos et al., 2009</a>). Engineered constitutive HIPV emissions have been used, either on predators and parasitoids trained to associate target volatiles with prey in short-term laboratory experiments (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kappers et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Schnee et al., 2006</a>), or in set-ups in which target volatiles are always associated with prey (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rasmann et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Degenhardt et al., 2009</a>). When plants are engineered constitutively to emit HIPVs, they no longer provide accurate information about the location of feeding herbivores, and predators will not associate these signals with prey in nature. Genetically silencing the biosynthesis of HIPVs, however, permits naturally inducible wild-type (WT) plants to serve as HIPV emitters, for comparison with transformed lines lacking specific volatile components (<a href=\"#bib19\">Halitschke et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Skibbe et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, field experiments that manipulate the production of HIPVs which not only attract the third trophic level, but also influence the second trophic level (e.g., as feeding stimulants and host location cues), require additional experimental manipulations to preserve the plant-herbivore part of the tritrophic interaction."

Non-toxic protease inhibitor (PI) proteins, which inhibit protein digestion and thus decrease the availability of organic nitrogen in the form of amino acids (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zavala et al., 2008</a>), are widespread in flowering plants (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hartl et al., 2011</a>), and trypsin protease inhibitors (TPIs) slow the growth of <i>M. sexta</i> on <i>N. attenuata</i> (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zavala et al., 2008</a>). However, herbivores can overcome PIs by producing insensitive or desensitized proteases, inactivating or degrading PIs, eating more plant tissue, and eating more nutritious young tissue (<a href=\"#bib59\">Winterer and Bergelson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Steppuhn and Baldwin, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zavala et al., 2008</a>).

Although TPI-producing <i>N. attenuata</i> plants produce more seeds than TPI-deficient plants when attacked by <i>M. sexta</i> under controlled glasshouse conditions (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zavala and Baldwin, 2004</a>), whether TPIs function as a direct defense in nature is unknown."

Because <i>N. attenuata</i> is an annual, opportunistic out-crosser, seeds are produced within one growing season, mostly from fertilization via self-pollen (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sime and Baldwin, 2003</a>), and we can relate bud and flower production to lifetime seed production, which is commonly accepted as a measure of Darwinian fitness (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baldwin, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">van Loon et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hoballah and Turlings, 2001</a>).We hypothesized that HIPVs would increase plant reproduction by increasing predation of herbivores, and that TPIs alone would not increase reproduction under herbivore attack, but would either increase predation or increase herbivores' susceptibility to predators.

In many years, <i>Manduca</i> spp. larvae cause the most defoliation of <i>N. attenuata</i> plants in this area (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</a>) and thus the <i>N. attenuata</i> 'UT' genotype is likely adapted to defend against <i>Manduca</i> spp. Eggs and young larvae of <i>Manduca</i> spp. are predated by <i>Geocoris</i> spp. (big-eyed bugs) which occur naturally in the Utah habitat and are attracted to components of <i>N. attenuata</i>'s HIPV bouquet (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Halitschke et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Skibbe et al., 2008</a>). Specifically, Utah <i>Geocoris</i> spp. predators are attracted to the sesquiterpene (<i>E</i>)-\u03b1-bergamotene as well as green leaf volatiles (fatty acid-derived C<sub>6</sub> aldehydes, alcohols and esters) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Halitschke et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schuman et al., 2009</a>). Green leaf volatiles, or GLVs, can be silenced via a single upstream 13-lipoxygenase, Na<i>LOX2</i>, which specifically supplies lipid hydroperoxides for their production (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allmann et al., 2010</a>). Although GLVs are released upon mechanical damage, the oral secretions (OS) of <i>M. sexta</i> convert 3-(<i>Z</i>)-GLVs to the 2-(<i>E</i>)-structures, resulting in greater <i>Geocoris</i> spp. predation than the damage-induced (<i>Z</i>):(<i>E</i>) ratio (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</a>). GLVs are released immediately upon damage (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</a>) and may therefore be a 'first line of defense'."

Furthermore, GLVs prime or directly regulate responses in neighboring plants (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kessler et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Paschold et al., 2006</a>), attract herbivores as well as predators (<a href=\"#bib19\">Halitschke et al., 2008</a>), and are important cues for pollinating and ovipositing moths (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">De Moraes et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fraser et al., 2003</a>), thus performing several roles which may harm or benefit plant fitness in addition to their role in attracting predators. Perhaps most significantly, GLVs also stimulate <i>Manduca</i> spp. feeding, and silencing plant GLV production results in reduced herbivore damage (<a href=\"#bib18\">Halitschke et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Meldau et al., 2009</a>). All these qualities made the manipulation of GLV emissions an ideal means to test rigorously the fitness consequences of HIPV emissions and to evaluate whether these emissions can truly be considered defensive."

To more accurately imitate <i>Geocoris</i> spp. attack, we developed an off-plant assay with larvae from the laboratory <i>M. sexta</i> strain feeding on detached leaves from field-grown plants, in which size-matched larvae were poked, pierced and lifted using an insect pin to mimic the <i>Geocoris</i> spp. beak (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3 and 4</a>). Similarly to the on-plant assay, larvae fed on WT leaves were 50% less likely to successfully attack the insect pin, either when initially poked, or poked and lifted with the pin (N=20 first-instar larvae matched for size, p&lt;0.05 in paired t-tests) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). We also monitored recovery post-trial and found that WT-fed larvae ceased to grow for at least 24 hr after simulated attack, while ir<i>PI</i>-fed larvae continued to grow (p=0.016 in Student's t-test); mortality did not differ (p=0.527 in Fisher's exact test) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>)."

To rigorously test the consequences of GLV-mediated predation of <i>Manduca</i> spp. on plant reproduction, we selected triplets of WT, ir<i>PI</i> and hemi-ir<i>LOX2</i> plants similar in size, previous reproductive output, apparent health, and prior damage to carry out <i>Manduca</i> spp. mortality and plant reproduction assays (M1 in 2010, M4 in 2011, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We removed all reproductive meristems from matched plants in 2011 to allow us to follow plant reproduction over full <i>Manduca</i> spp. larval development without incurring ripe transgenic seed capsules.

These agents are usually naturally occurring generalist parasitoids and predators, such as <i>Geocoris</i> spp. (<a href=\"#bib10\">Eubanks and Denno, 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Allison and Hare, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</a>). HIPVs are produced by genotypes of most, if not all crop plants and IPM would benefit from selective breeding or engineering of HIPV emission (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kos et al., 2009</a>) rather than relying on alternatives such as controlled release dispensers, which have mixed success and require large amounts of synthetic HIPVs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kaplan, 2012</a>). PIs may be employed to enhance the efficiency of indirect defense, especially combined with toxins like Bt that directly target herbivores and are safe for biological control agents. With growing concerns about field-evolved Bt resistance (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2010</a>), indirect defenses promise an effective 'first line of defense' against agricultural pests, to which not even specialist herbivores are likely to rapidly evolve resistance."

Reproductive output was monitored by counting the number of closed flowers removed every 2\u20133 days (before they opened) from the beginning of flowering, and by counting numbers of closed flowers and buds 2 mm or larger at the end of infestation M1 in 2010, and during all infestations in 2011. All growth and reproduction data were analyzed for differences in control versus <i>M. sexta</i>-infested plants within each genotype (statistics <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Because size-matched plants had been planted over one week in 2011, growth and reproduction data from plants in 2011 were organized by the number of days since planting for comparison between genotypes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

For infestation M4 in 2011 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), instead of regularly removing flowers, we removed all reproductive meristems by cutting inflorescences, which contained mostly buds, at their base, so that we would be able to follow a new set of reproductive meristems through to seed set without incurring ripe seed. Because plants were matched prior to M4 and had the same number of buds and of side branches (which usually terminate in inflorescences) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, see 'Discussion'), all plants were similarly affected by the removal of reproductive meristems."

The naturally occurring herbivore community on plants in 2010 and 2011 comprised mirids (<i>Tupiocoris notatus</i>) and noctuid larvae; in 2011 grasshoppers (<i>Trimerotropis</i> spp.) and flea beetles (<i>Epitrix</i> spp.) were also present. Total canopy damage due to herbivores occurring naturally on the field plot was quantified prior to the infestations in 2010 and 2011 and again during infestation M3 in 2011. Damage was calculated by identifying damage from specific herbivores according to their characteristic feeding patterns, counting the number of leaves per plant (small leaves were counted as 1/5 to 1/2 of a leaf based on leaf area and large leaves were counted as 1 leaf), estimating the total percentage of leaf area damage due to each herbivore, and dividing the total leaf area damage from each herbivore by the total number of leaves. Leaf area damage was estimated in categories of 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and so on, in steps of 5%. All such damage estimates were made by MCS or KB, who first practiced quantifying damage together until they consistently arrived at the same numbers."

Levene's test for homogeneity of variance was performed prior to all t-tests and ANOVAs and when necessary, data were log<sub>2</sub> transformed (volatile and transcript data), square root transformed (count data) or arcsin transformed (herbivore damage data) to meet requirements for homogeneity of variance. Parametric data were compared using ANOVAs, MANOVAs, or repeated-measure ANOVAs followed by Scheffe <i>post hoc</i> tests. If variance was not homogeneous following transformation, data were compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests (for multiple comparisons) or Mann-Whitney U-tests (for two-way comparisons) and Bonferroni p-value corrections were used to correct for nonparametric multiple comparisons. For Kruskal-Wallis tests and Mann-Whitney U-tests, a Monte Carlo algorithm was used with 10,000 permutations and a 95% confidence level."

To make the content of the work more accessible, the paper should be presented with separate sections for introduction, results, and discussion, and subsections for the results. In addition, the supplementary figures as well as the supplementary narrative should be integrated into the main text, and the data should be better and more consistently presented in the figures. For example, the colour code for different genotypes in Fig. S1-3 and 6A,B should also be applied in all other figures."

This makes unfortunately in several places for difficult reading. In addition, the paper is extremely densely written and difficult to follow for those unfamiliar with the research program of the authors. To make the content of the work more accessible, the paper should be presented with separate sections for introduction, results, and discussion, and subsections for the results. In addition, the supplementary figures as well as the supplementary narrative should be integrated into the main text, and the data should be better and more consistently presented in the figures. For example, the colour code for different genotypes in Fig. S1-3 and 6A,B should also be applied in all other figures</i>."
