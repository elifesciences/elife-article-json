                    "text": "Hitherto, membralin has been a protein of unknown function. Here, we show that membralin mutant mice manifest a severe and early-onset motor neuron disease in an autosomal recessive manner, dying by postnatal day 5\u20136. Selective death of lower motor neurons, including those innervating the limbs, intercostal muscles, and diaphragm, is predominantly responsible for this fatal phenotype. Neural expression of a membralin transgene completely rescues membralin mutant mice. Mechanistically, we show that membralin interacts with Erlin2, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that is located in lipid rafts and known to be important in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Accordingly, the degradation rate of ERAD substrates is attenuated in cells lacking membralin. Membralin mutations or deficiency in mouse models induces ER stress, rendering neurons more vulnerable to cell death. Our study reveals a critical role of membralin in motor neuron survival and suggests a novel mechanism for early-onset motor neuron disease."

Here, we show that membralin mutant mice manifest a severe and early-onset motor neuron disease in an autosomal recessive manner, dying by postnatal day 5\u20136. Selective death of lower motor neurons, including those innervating the limbs, intercostal muscles, and diaphragm, is predominantly responsible for this fatal phenotype. Neural expression of a membralin transgene completely rescues membralin mutant mice. Mechanistically, we show that membralin interacts with Erlin2, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that is located in lipid rafts and known to be important in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Accordingly, the degradation rate of ERAD substrates is attenuated in cells lacking membralin. Membralin mutations or deficiency in mouse models induces ER stress, rendering neurons more vulnerable to cell death. Our study reveals a critical role of membralin in motor neuron survival and suggests a novel mechanism for early-onset motor neuron disease."

There, the proteins are folded into the specific three-dimensional shapes that allow them to carry out their respective jobs. Sometimes the folding process goes awry, leading to a build-up of unfolded proteins that stress the endoplasmic reticulum and can kill the cell. Brain cells are particularly vulnerable to death from endoplasmic reticulum stress. To combat a deadly build-up of unfolded proteins, each cell has systems that respond when the endoplasmic reticulum is under stress."

In diseases like ALS, the nerve cells that control muscle movements gradually die off, causing a loss of muscle control and eventually death. Scientists suspect that these nerve cells (called motor neurons) are particularly sensitive to endoplasmic reticulum stress because they are highly active. Drugs that help counteract stress on the endoplasmic reticulum extend the lives of mice with motor neuron disease, suggesting this may be a useful strategy for treating such diseases in humans."

Mutations in this endoplasmic reticulum stress response protein have previously been linked to motor neuron diseases. The motor neurons in membralin-deficient mice show signs of endoplasmic reticulum stress and are extra vulnerable to chemicals that induce protein misfolding. Together, the experiments show membralin plays an important role in mitigating stress on the endoplasmic reticulum. More studies of mice lacking membralin may help explain why the endoplasmic reticulum stress increases in motor neuron diseases and may point to possible treatments."

ER stress is often triggered by the accumulation of unfolded proteins due to pathological conditions, such as DNA sequence mutations, transcriptional and translational errors, or protein folding failure (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lin et al., 2008</a>). Mammalian cells have evolved an intricate system with multiple signaling pathways to respond to ER stress, collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>). If unchecked, ER stress eventually causes cell death, including neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lindholm et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Scheper and Hoozemans, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hetz and Mollereau, 2014</a>)."

Manifestations and consequences of ER stress have been studied in the pathogenesis of SOD1 mutant mice, a commonly used model of ALS that expresses mutant human SOD1 protein as found in some inherited forms of ALS (<a href=\"#bib6\">Atkin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kanekura et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Saxena et al., 2009</a>). Many ER stress-related molecules are upregulated in SOD1 mice at an early stage of the disease, and some are specific to motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tobisawa et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Atkin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kikuchi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nagata et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ito et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Saxena et al., 2009</a>). In addition, reduction in the ER co-chaperone SIL1 has been found to be associated specifically with ER stress-prone, fast-fatigable motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib24\">Filezac de L'Etang et al., 2015</a>). ER upregulation of the UPR and aberrant modification of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) also occur in human tissues from sporadic ALS (<a href=\"#bib7\">Atkin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Walker et al., 2010</a>). Our studies on the activation of the type I interferon signaling in astrocytes at pre-symptomatic stages of SOD1 mice also suggest that ER stress in motor neurons may play a crucial role in disease onset (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, genetic interruption of UPR signaling molecules, such as XBP-1 or apoptosis signal-regulating kinase1 (ASK1), protects motor neurons in SOD1 mutant mice (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nishitoh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hetz and Mollereau, 2014</a>). It has been suggested that the unusually heavy metabolic demand of motor neurons may make them particularly susceptible to ER stress (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vinay et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carrascal et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2005</a>). Importantly, ER stress inhibitors, such as salubrinal, guanabenz, and sphin1, delay disease onset and prolong the survival of these mutant mice (<a href=\"#bib57\">Saxena et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jiang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Das et al., 2015</a>).

Thus, our GluN3B knockout (KO) mice also carry a C-terminal truncation of membralin. We observed that GluN3B/membralin C-terminal double-knockout (DKO) mice die at postnatal day 5\u20136 of paresis due to severe motor neuron degeneration. Transgenic expression of membralin, but not GluN3B, rescued the phenotypes of DKO mice. Additionally, we generated membralin-specific KO mice and found that they phenocopied the DKO mice. These data suggest that membralin plays a critical role in motor neuron survival. We also demonstrate that membralin interacts with Erlin2, a protein that is enriched in ER lipid rafts and important for ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ikegawa et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Browman et al., 2006</a>). Additionally, neurons from membralin mutant mice display increased basal ER stress and increased vulnerability to ER stress-inducing agents. Our discovery that membralin mutations result in motor neuron disease provides mechanistic insight into pathophysiology and may offer a novel target for therapy."

The number of motor neurons in DKO mice was unchanged at P0 and P3, but reduced by 40% at P5, compared to littermate WT controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). The remaining motor neurons appeared smaller than those of WT mice. Motor neuron loss and surrounding astrogliosis were also apparent in the cervical spinal cords of P5 DKO mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We next examined Isg15 expression (interferon-induced 17 kDa protein), which is thought to play a role in innate immunity and is upregulated at both pre-symptomatic stages and post-symptomatic stages in a mouse model of ALS (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). WT mice manifested minimal Isg15 expression throughout the brain and spinal cord. In contrast, by P3, DKO mice had increased Isg15 expression in the ventral horn of the cervical and lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). By P5, DKO mice showed increased Isg15 expression in additional areas containing primary motor neurons, with highest expression in the ventral horn of all segments of the spinal cord and moderate expression in the facial nucleus of the brainstem (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). No Isg15 expression was detectable in other brain areas, even in late-stage DKO mice. These results suggest that the motor neurons are progressively injured in DKO mice, starting with those in the spinal cord. Since the normal process of programmed cell death in embryonic motor neurons is complete at birth (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lance-Jones, 1982</a>), the loss of motor neurons in DKO mice was most likely due to cellular events occurring perinatally."

Motor neuron axons in the ventral root of DKO mice showed advanced degeneration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), whereas sensory neuron axons in the dorsal root were intact (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Under high magnification of motor neuron axons, we saw intra-axonal vacuoles and the loss of axoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), as well as disintegrated myelin and amorphous lipids (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>), as typically seen in Wallerian degeneration. The percentage of degenerated axons in the ventral root of DKO mice reached 48.0 \u00b1 4.1% by P5, which was significantly greater (p &lt; 0.01) than in WT mice (8.6 \u00b1 1.5%) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). In contrast, the percentage of degenerated axons in the dorsal root of DKO mice (10.5 \u00b1 1.9%) was similar to that of the WT ventral root, consistent with the normal background level of axonal degeneration that occurs during development. Moreover, the sensory afferent terminals in the spinal cord of DKO mice appeared normal (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). In contrast, we found degeneration of phrenic motor nerve fibers and terminals in P5 DKO mice (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). These results further confirm the selective death of motor neurons in DKO mice, potentially leading to respiratory failure due to loss of motor neuron innervation of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm. Taken together, our DKO mice present a phenotype of early-onset and apparently selective motor neuron degeneration."

Therefore, we tested whether transgenically expressed intact membralin or GluN3B could rescue DKO mice. We generated a transgenic mouse line carrying full-length membralin under the control of the murine <i>prion</i> promoter, followed by internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cDNA sequences (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The membralin transgenic mice [Tg (membralin)] were fertile, normal in size, and did not display any gross physical or behavioral abnormalities compared with their littermate controls. When Tg (membralin) mice were crossbred with DKO mice, the DKO/Tg (membralin) mice were apparently normal, manifesting neither paresis nor premature death (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus, the membralin transgene rescued DKO mice, even though membralin mRNA levels remained somewhat lower than in WT mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). GFP immunostaining in the ventral horn of the spinal cord showed that membralin/GFP transgene expression was predominantly neuronal, although we could not rule out relatively weak expression in glial cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The DKO/Tg (membralin) mice showed no sign of motor defects or motor neuron loss, despite the absence of GluN3B expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In contrast, the GluN3B transgene did not rescue DKO mice (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and GluN3B KO mice generated by deleting the first exon did not show any defect in motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib52\">Niemann et al., 2007</a>).

Western blot analysis of spinal cord samples from WT and KO mice showed specific expression of membralin in the ER but not in the cytosol or mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Since our anti-membralin antibody proved ineffective for immunostaining, we made a fusion protein by adding a myc tag to the C-terminus of membralin (membralin-myc). Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that membralin-myc co-localized with an ER marker PDI but not with markers for Golgi or mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Membralin-myc was not expressed on the cell surface, since it was not detected in transfected cells without first permeabilizing the membrane (data not shown). Software for topology prediction from the Center for Biological Sequences (CBS, TMHMM) indicated that the membralin is most likely a transmembrane protein with 4\u20136 membrane-spanning regions, containing an ER-lumen domain between membrane-spanning regions 1 and 2. Additionally, the protein has multiple glycosylation sites and cytosolic regions at both the N-terminal ends and C-terminal ends (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

Erlin2 is a protein that is enriched in ER lipid rafts (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ikegawa et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Browman et al., 2006</a>), and mutations in Erlin2 have been linked to several human diseases with motor dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib2\">Al-Yahyaee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alazami et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yildirim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Saif et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wakil et al., 2013</a>). We designed experiments to verify the membralin/Erlin2 interaction. We found that GFP-tagged membralin not only co-localized with but also manifested a strong FRET signal with mCherry-tagged Erlin2 in the ER (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The FRET efficiency was significantly higher for GFP-tagged membralin and mCherry-tagged Erlin2 (18.00 \u00b1 0.70%) than the negative control (GFP and mCherry, 0.15 \u00b1 0.05%), consistent with a direct interaction of the two molecules (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Additionally, Myc-tagged full-length membralin co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged Erlin2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This interaction of membralin with Erlin2 further supports the notion that membralin is an ER membrane protein and also suggests that loss of membralin could potentially increase ER stress by interrupting ERAD. Indeed, we found that the ER membrane protein, CD3-\u03b4, was cleared more slowly in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared from membralin KO mice than from WT mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), whereas there was no change in the clearance of the ER lumenal protein, NHK (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that membralin deficiency affects degradation of ER membrane proteins, which could potentially increase ER stress. Thus, we next analyzed ER stress in membralin KO mice."

We, therefore, tested whether the absence of membralin impacted ER stress (<a href=\"#bib67\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>). Western blot analysis showed that the levels of GRP78 and ATF4, two molecules induced during ER stress via activation of the PERK signaling pathway, were consistently higher in the spinal cord of P3 membralin KO mice than WT mice (154 \u00b1 35% and 412 \u00b1 39% of WT, respectively; KO, <i>n</i> = 4; WT, <i>n</i> = 3; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In contrast, levels of spliced XBP-1, indicating activation of the IRE1 signaling pathway during ER stress, were not altered (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, produced a greater degree of cell death in MEFs from KO mice than from WT mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Tunicamycin exposure also increased CHOP and ATF4 levels earlier and to a greater extent in MEFs from KO mice; GRP78 levels were also higher at 24 hr post-exposure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Basal levels of ATF4, but not CHOP, were higher in membralin KO mice than WT mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), but XBP-1 splicing was not altered (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

In contrast to proximal HMN, distal HMN represents a heterogeneous group of peripheral neuropathies affecting mainly distal muscles with both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance (<a href=\"#bib31\">Irobi et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Irobi-Devolder, 2008</a>). Seven subgroups of distal HMN were initially proposed based on age of onset, mode of inheritance, and clinical features of a limited number of affected families (<a href=\"#bib27\">Harding, 1993</a>). Additional forms of distal HMN were subsequently reported, adding more genetic complexity. A dozen of causal gene loci and other associated genes have been identified for distal HMN (exclusive of type I); these genes encode for a functionally heterogeneous group of proteins, as summarized in recent reviews (<a href=\"#bib31\">Irobi et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Irobi-Devolder, 2008</a>). The biological functions of the affected proteins include stress responses (small heat shock proteins HSP22, HSP27), housekeeping (GARS, glycyl tRNA synthetase), protein glycosylation in the ER (seipin), RNA processing (immunoglobulin \u03bc-binding protein 2 [LGHMBP2] and senataxin), and axonal transport (dynactin). It is not clear, however, how these mutated proteins of diverse cellular function converge to affect motor neuron survival selectively. In fact, their expression is not even restricted to motor neurons. A similar case is found for membralin in this study. Therefore, further studies on molecular mechanisms underlying the selectivity of motor neuron death in distal HMN will be critical to understanding the disease. A hint towards pathogenesis may be found in prior work in conjunction with our new findings and involves an unusual susceptibility of motor neurons to various forms of cell stress, particularly ER stress."

                        "text": "Accordingly, the membralin KO mouse generated in our laboratory provides a good model to study selective motor neuron vulnerability. These mice display severe motor neuron loss and muscle wasting, leading to paresis and death. Although the early disease onset in membralin KO mice is similar to that seen in an SMA mouse model (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hsieh-Li et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Monani et al., 2000</a>), the pattern of motor neuron injury in membralin KO mice is reminiscent of human distal HMN rather than proximal HMN, as observed in SMA. Of the dozen known causal genes for distal HMN, only a few show autosomal recessive inheritance, and no mouse model has, heretofore, been generated (<a href=\"#bib31\">Irobi et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Irobi-Devolder, 2008</a>). Therefore, the membralin null mouse represents a novel model for human distal HMN. Additionally, our studies demonstrate the previously unknown function of membralin in motor neuron survival. Our findings from endogenous and heterologous expression studies suggest that membralin is mainly located in the ER. Relatively low expression of membralin seems sufficient for normal function, as heterozygotes of the membralin KO survived, and transgene rescue of the membralin KO did not require high expression levels. Importantly, in our rescue experiments, membralin transgene expression was primarily in brain, not muscle, consistent with the notion that the pathogenic process is predominantly neural in origin. The exact mechanisms underlying motor neuron death in membralin KO mice are not yet clear, although death occurs very rapidly at an early and well-defined postnatal stage. Thus, membralin KO mice can be used not only as an early-onset model of motor neuron disease but also to determine if there are features in common with late-onset motor neuron disease, such as motor neuron-specific vulnerability to ER stress (<a href=\"#bib57\">Saxena et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Roselli and Caroni, 2015</a>), dying back axonopathy (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fischer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Coleman, 2005</a>), or non-cell autonomous death (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boillee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yamanaka et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kang et al., 2013</a>)."

In the present study, we found that membralin interacts with Erlin2, an ER membrane protein potentially involved in ERAD (<a href=\"#bib18\">Christianson et al., 2012</a>). The exact cellular functions of Erlin2 are not clear, although it has been reported to interact with several ER resident E3 ligases such as GP78 and Hrd1 that are important for ERAD (<a href=\"#bib18\">Christianson et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, Erlin2 has been shown to regulate ER membrane proteins such as Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pearce et al., 2007</a>). It is conceivable that membralin assists Erlin2 in a complex that retrotranslocates unfolded proteins from the ER lumen to the cytosol, thus facilitating their ubiquitination for degradation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Schulze et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Carvalho et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Denic et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Vembar and Brodsky, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Carvalho et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Smith et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Brodsky, 2012</a>). Consequently, membralin deficiency might increase both basal ER stress and vulnerability to ER stress-induced cell death, and this is exactly what we observed. We also found differences in Isg15 levels in membralin KO mice, leading to ISGylation, a process that represents a type I interferon-dependent, ER stress-triggered event. This observation is interesting in light of prior findings showing that ISGylation is a pre-symptomatic event observed in a mouse model of ALS (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). Collectively, our data suggest that the loss of membralin may contribute to degeneration by increasing ER stress in motor neurons, which are especially vulnerable to such stress due to their large metabolic demand. This demand is particularly prevalent postnatally when maturation of motor neurons requires synthesis of proteins for production of dendritic trees, synaptic connections, and ionic conductances (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vinay et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carrascal et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2005</a>)."

Moreover, disturbance in various other components of ERAD, including OS-9, erasin, ubiquilin2, torsinA, and Derlin1, causes ER stress (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nishitoh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Alcock and Swanton, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Deng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nery et al., 2011</a>), and some of these genes have been linked to ALS (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nishitoh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Alcock and Swanton, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alazami et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nery et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yildirim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Saif et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wakil et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, future elucidation of the exact role of membralin in ERAD will undoubtedly be important for understanding the contribution of ER stress to motor neuron diseases. Interestingly, there are more than 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of human membralin that result in missense mutations (NBCI SNP database). The minor allele frequency of most SNPs is either low or has not been determined, suggesting that these SNPs are not common in the human population. Thus, our studies point to a specific role of membralin in motor neuron survival and potentially open a new avenue for research in the field of human motor neuron diseases."

The number of motor neurons in each section was counted stereologically using adjacent sections for reference and look-up (physical disector). The total number of motor neurons was obtained for each mouse, and the mean value for 3 mice at each age group was calculated and normalized to that of WT mice. The general appearance of motor neurons was examined by conventional staining methods used in analysis of SOD1 mutant mice, including hematoxylin/eosin and cresyl violet staining."

In general, the study is well-performed, and the conclusions are intriguing. In addition, the work describes an interesting function for a previously poorly-characterized protein.

Briefly, consecutive sections (12 \u00b5m in thickness) of the lumber enlargement (L1-L5) were collected for immunostaining with anti-Hb9 antibody to identify motor neurons. The number of motor neurons in each section was counted based on stereological counting methods using adjacent sections as a reference and look-up section, respectively (physical disector). We have added these details to the Methods section (in the subsection headed \u201cImmunostaining and histological analysis\u201d). We believe this counting method represents the best estimation in determining the average number of motor neurons in the spinal cord of each genetic group. We found that matching exactly the anatomical location in the brain or spinal cord tissue of WT and KO mice at postnatal day 5 was not achievable due to the variation in size and fragility of the tissue (which lacks fully developed white matter)."

We have clarified this procedure in the revised text (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> legend). We bred homozygous DKO mice with the membralin transgene rather than heterozygous because it reduces the number of mice used and conserves funds."

In addition, it is extremely difficult to detect the endogenous protein due to either the low amount of endogenous membralin or the poor quality of the available antibody. The membralin protein data shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> were obtained by using the membrane fraction of protein purified from approximately half of the brain (this is now indicated in the figure legend).
