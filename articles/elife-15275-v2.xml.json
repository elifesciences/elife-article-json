Surprisingly, less than 50% of hippocampal CA1 presynaptic boutons contain mitochondria, raising the question of whether synapses without mitochondria can sustain changes in efficacy. To address this question, we analyzed synapses from postnatal day 15 (P15) and adult rat hippocampus that had undergone theta-burst stimulation to produce long-term potentiation (TBS-LTP) and compared them to control or no stimulation. At 30 and 120 min after TBS-LTP, vesicles were decreased only in presynaptic boutons that contained mitochondria at P15, and vesicle decrement was greatest in adult boutons containing mitochondria. Presynaptic mitochondrial cristae were widened, suggesting a sustained energy demand. Thus, mitochondrial proximity reflected enhanced vesicle mobilization well after potentiation reached asymptote, in parallel with the apparently silent addition of new dendritic spines at P15 or the silent enlargement of synapses in adults."

Surprisingly, less than 50% of hippocampal CA1 presynaptic boutons contain mitochondria, raising the question of whether synapses without mitochondria can sustain changes in efficacy. To address this question, we analyzed synapses from postnatal day 15 (P15) and adult rat hippocampus that had undergone theta-burst stimulation to produce long-term potentiation (TBS-LTP) and compared them to control or no stimulation. At 30 and 120 min after TBS-LTP, vesicles were decreased only in presynaptic boutons that contained mitochondria at P15, and vesicle decrement was greatest in adult boutons containing mitochondria. Presynaptic mitochondrial cristae were widened, suggesting a sustained energy demand. Thus, mitochondrial proximity reflected enhanced vesicle mobilization well after potentiation reached asymptote, in parallel with the apparently silent addition of new dendritic spines at P15 or the silent enlargement of synapses in adults."

                        "text": "Mitochondria are essential players in synaptic transmission. They produce more than 90% of all neuronal ATP (<a href=\"#bib34\">Harris et al., 2012</a>), which is needed in many steps of the synaptic vesicle cycle (<a href=\"#bib92\">S\u00fcdhof, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chua et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Sudhof and Rizo, 2011</a>). Mitochondria synthesize the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from glutamine (<a href=\"#bib100\">Waagepetersoen et al., 2003</a>). The filling of synaptic vesicles with glutamate requires mitochondrial ATP (<a href=\"#bib28\">Forgac, 2007</a>). Docking of synaptic vesicles does not appear to require ATP; however, priming them for subsequent release is an ATP-dependent process (<a href=\"#bib103\">Yao and Bajjalieh, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Verhage and S\u00f8rensen, 2008</a>). Following release, dissociation of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex is an ATP-dependent process that reactivates monomeric SNARE proteins (<a href=\"#bib87\">Sudhof and Rizo, 2011</a>). Endosome-based recycling of synaptic vesicles causes local depletion of ATP and increased production of ATP by mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib74\">Rangaraju et al., 2014</a>). Mitochondria contain their own DNA; the proteome of presynaptic mitochondria is enriched in proteins that supply energy and are engaged in synaptic transmission, whereas the proteome of nonsynaptic axonal mitochondria clusters around metabolic and morphogenic proteins (<a href=\"#bib99\">V\u00f6lgyi et al., 2015</a>). Axonal mitochondria can move, although they typically remain stationary for periods of hours even after substantial activation (<a href=\"#bib65\">Overly et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Obashi and Okabe, 2013</a>). Interestingly, diffusion of ATP from mitochondria-containing boutons can sustain synaptic transmission at cultured hippocampal synapses without mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib67\">Pathak et al., 2015</a>). In addition, ATP from glycolysis can also support synaptic transmission under resting conditions, but mobilization of vesicles from the reserve pool requires mitochondrial ATP (<a href=\"#bib97\">Verstreken et al., 2005</a>). Indeed, total vesicular release correlates well with the presence and volume of presynaptic mitochondria, suggesting their proximity may enhance synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib88\">Sun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ivannikov et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "Prior to weaning, at postnatal day 21 in rats, neurons have a low capacity for glucose utilization and instead use ketone bodies as their primary energy substrate (<a href=\"#bib95\">Vannucci, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nehlig et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Nehlig, 2004</a>). Unlike glucose metabolism, ketone body metabolism requires mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib30\">Fukao et al., 2004</a>), suggesting there might be a stronger requirement for mitochondria to fuel synaptic vesicle cycling at younger ages. Changes in mitochondrial dimensions and the ultrastructure of matrix and cristae reflect altered energy demands (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ishihara et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cagalinec et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hackenbrock, 1966</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Perkins et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Packer, 1960</a>). Under resting conditions, mitochondria have loosely packed matrix and narrow cristae, whereas under conditions of high energy demand the matrix compacts and cristae widen (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hackenbrock, 1966</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">1968</a>). These changes appear to reflect, for example, the action of mitochondrial dynamin-like proteins engaged in the metabolic processes (<a href=\"#bib56\">Mannella, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Patten et al., 2014</a>). Mitochondria also provide local sequestration of calcium that is important for enhanced vesicular release during post-tetanic potentiation lasting a few minutes (<a href=\"#bib93\">Tang and Zucker, 1997</a>). Thus, the proximity and ultrastructure of presynaptic mitochondria should reliably reflect the capacity to mobilize vesicles and influence the duration of synaptic plasticity depending on the level of activation and the age of the animals."

This finding raised the question of whether synapses without presynaptic mitochondria can sustain robust and enduring changes in efficacy. To address this question, we analyzed hippocampal synapses that had undergone theta-burst stimulation (TBS) to produce long-term potentiation (LTP) in rat hippocampal area CA1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bourne and Harris, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Watson et al., 2016</a>). LTP is a cellular model of learning that produces enhancement of synaptic efficacy lasting hours to days or longer. Control synapses included those that had undergone test pulses in the same slice or from hippocampus that was unstimulated and perfusion-fixed in vivo. Comparisons were made between postnatal day 15, a pre-weaning age during peak synaptogenesis, and young adult rats at ages (55\u201370 days old) when intrinsic synaptogenesis has plateaued (<a href=\"#bib35\">Harris et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fiala et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Kirov et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Semple et al., 2013</a>). Prior work has shown an LTP-related increase in synapse number at P15 (<a href=\"#bib102\">Watson et al., 2016</a>), whereas, in the young adults, synapses enlarged at the expense of synaptogenesis by 120 min after the induction of LTP with TBS (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bourne and Harris, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bell et al., 2014</a>). LTP is known to alter many presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bayazitov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Enoki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Huang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Ratnayaka et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Zakharenko et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Huganir and Nicoll, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arendt et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hill and Zito, 2013</a>). However, relationships between these changes in efficacy and the proximity of presynaptic mitochondria have not been investigated. Here, 3DEM was used to determine whether sustained synaptic plasticity was specific to mitochondria-containing presynaptic boutons."

Then their greater association with more vesicles might have been due to chance because the larger synaptic boutons contained more vesicles. We performed several analyses to address this concern. First, we computed that the portion of axonal volume occupied by mitochondria (28%) was markedly less than the portion of axonal volume without mitochondria (72%, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Next, we showed that mitochondria were equally distributed between nonsynaptic inter-bouton regions (51%) and synaptic boutons (49%, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). As predicted, we found that axonal diameters were significantly wider at synaptic boutons (0.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.015 \u00b5m) than at nonsynaptic regions (0.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.008 \u00b5m, n\u00a0=\u00a075, F<sub>1,71</sub>\u00a0=\u00a037.5, p&lt;0.001). However, mitochondrial diameters were similar at synaptic (0.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.009 \u00b5m) and nonsynaptic (0.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.007 \u00b5m) regions (n\u00a0=\u00a075, F<sub>1,71</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.25, p=0.27). Finally, the mitochondria fit into all regions of the axon (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). These results suggest that mitochondria were not restricted from entering even the narrow inter-bouton regions of the axon, as would be required since they can move along axons. The findings also show that mitochondria were not uniformly distributed throughout the axon, as the vast majority of the axon length and volume contained no mitochondria. Furthermore, as shown in subsequent analyses, synapses spanning the full range of sizes (indicated by the presynaptic vesicle counts and PSD areas in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8</a>) could be associated with presynaptic boutons that contained mitochondria as well as with those that did not contain mitochondria. Thus, the significant effects of mitochondrial proximity on changes in synapse size and presynaptic composition reported below do not appear merely to be due to a chance restriction of mitochondria to larger synaptic boutons."

Piecewise regression functions were fitted to each scatterplot to determine whether there is a threshold distance beyond which synaptic efficacy, as related to presynaptic vesicle number or synapse area, is no longer correlated with mitochondrial proximity."

At P15, control stimulation eliminated dendritic spines, whereas following TBS there was a nearly 50% increase in spines, which served to sustain single synaptic boutons and increase multisynaptic boutons. In contrast, in adults the spinogenesis induced by control stimulation was blocked by the TBS-related synapse enlargement (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bourne and Harris, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bell et al., 2014</a>). At P15, less than 30% of the presynaptic boutons contained mitochondria at 2 hr following TBS, suggesting that TBS-related spinogenesis mostly involved presynaptic boutons without mitochondria. Since only the mitochondria-containing boutons had elevated vesicle mobilization at P15, the TBS-related spinogenesis likely occurred at boutons lacking enhanced vesicle mobilization. This arrangement could account for the stable level of potentiation at 2 hr despite the addition of new spines. In adults, more boutons contained mitochondria under both control and TBS conditions than at P15, and TBS resulted in fewer small spines and SSBs. The number of mitochondria also decreased in adult axons following TBS. These results suggest that in adults, but not at P15, mitochondrial and synaptic frequencies are coupled."

At P15, half of all axonal mitochondria resided in nonsynaptic inter-bouton regions and only 28% of axonal volume surrounded the mitochondria. Thus, although mitochondria were found all along the axons, synaptic boutons with mitochondria had more vesicles and larger synapses than those without mitochondria. These findings are in agreement with those from cultured hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Li et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Obashi and Okabe, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sapir et al., 2012</a>) and adult amygdala (<a href=\"#bib63\">Ostroff et al., 2012</a>), where presynaptic boutons with mitochondria also had more vesicles. Only the presynaptic boutons that contained mitochondria showed a decrease in docked and nondocked vesicles after TBS-LTP at P15. In contrast, the sustained mobilization of vesicles after TBS-LTP was not as strictly dependent on mitochondrial proximity in adults. Results from cultured hippocampal neurons using FM1-43 show that a large proportion of axonal boutons do not release synaptic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib15\">Crawford and Mennerick, 2012</a>). Chemical induction of LTP produces an increase in the number of release sites without enhancing the average vesicle release probability (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bolshakov et al., 1997</a>), suggesting that the new synapses in this preparation might also be presynaptically silent. New synapses lack postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors (<a href=\"#bib72\">Petralia et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Shi et al., 1999</a>) and hence also could be postsynaptically silent."

Ketone body metabolism requires mitochondria while glucose metabolism does not (<a href=\"#bib30\">Fukao et al., 2004</a>).

Polyribosomes are immediately recruited to large spine heads at 5 min. Between 5\u00a0and\u00a030 min, polyribosomes become further elevated throughout the dendrites and spines under both control and TBS-LTP conditions. These dynamics could reflect protein synthesis-dependent processes for both control spinogenesis and TBS-LTP-related synapse enlargement by 120 min in adults. Similar analyses are not available for TBS-LTP at P15, although polyribosomes are known to be dynamic following tetanus-induced LTP (<a href=\"#bib64\">Ostroff et al., 2002</a>). Thus, if the presynaptic vesicle decrease resulted from increased spontaneous release, as discussed above, it might account for the return of local postsynaptic translation to control levels once the silent TBS-related synaptogenesis at P15 (or growth in adults) is complete."

Despite the age-related differences in the sites of synaptogenesis, the occurrence of synapse enlargement, or the degree of vesicle mobilization, the responses of mitochondrial ultrastructure to TBS were nearly identical. At both ages, there was no change in the percentage of mitochondria that were located at presynaptic versus nonsynaptic sites along the axons. At both ages, more of the mitochondria had a non-orthodox configuration and the cristae were enlarged following TBS-LTP for synaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria. These observations suggest that there were increased demands for ATP production all along the axons following TBS-LTP. Of course, oxidative stress and calcium concentrations also affect mitochondrial structure (<a href=\"#bib29\">Frezza et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hackenbrock and Caplan, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Scalettar et al., 1991</a>). Future studies directly measuring ATP concentrations after TBS, together with higher resolution analyses of mitochondrial ultrastructure (<a href=\"#bib70\">Perkins et al., 2010</a>), will help to elucidate whether the LTP-associated changes in mitochondrial structure are a consequence of metabolic demand. Spinogenesis and synapse growth require energy and may reflect the preparation of synapses to respond to the next bout of plasticity. At P15, the next bout could stabilize the new connectivity, while in adults the next bout could recruit vesicles to new docking sites at the enlarged nascent zones. This interpretation is consistent with recent findings showing that sufficient time must pass before the initial LTP became unsaturated and a second bout of TBS could augment the potentiation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Babayan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bell et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cao and Harris, 2014</a>)."

Field excitatory post synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were estimated by linear regression over 400 \u00b5s along the maximal initial slope (mV/ms) of the response following the test pulse. Test pulses, which were delivered at a rate of one pulse every two minutes, consisted of 100 \u00b5s of constant biphasic current at an intensity level designed to evoke a half-maximal fEPSP and then were held constant for the remainder of the experiment. After recording the responses to test pulse stimulation for forty minutes, theta-burst stimulation (TBS: 8 trains of ten bursts at 5 Hz of four pulses at 100 Hz delivered 30 s apart) was delivered to one of the two stimulating electrodes. Then test pulses were alternated between the TBS and control stimulating electrodes and responses were monitored for 5 min (n\u00a0=\u00a02), 30 min (n\u00a0=\u00a03), or 120 min (n\u00a0=\u00a02) after the onset of TBS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#bib102\">Watson et al., 2016</a>).

The authors also compare boutons containing mitochondria, boutons closer than 3 microns from a mitochondrion, and the remaining boutons, providing a direct comparison and internal control under otherwise identical experimental conditions. These methodological choices, together with their use of 3D electron microscopy \u2013 the gold standard for structural studies of synapses \u2013 has resulted in a compelling and high-quality manuscript. While the approach is essentially descriptive and correlative, the data on vesicle numbers and the correlation with mitochondrial location and volume are particularly compelling and interesting. The twist of analyzing this for young animals, before weaning (P15) vs. adult represents a very neat way to get at morphological correlates for tolerance to repetitive activation."

For example, in the last paragraph of the subsection \u201cMitochondria-related differences in synapse size and vesicle composition at P15 in vivo\u201d they write that the proximity of presynaptic mitochondria supports larger synapses with more vesicles. Maybe the larger synapses are able to accommodate a mitochondrion while the smaller ones do not because of space limitations? It is not clear what is cause and what is consequence. In the last paragraph of the subsection \u201cInfluence of distance from mitochondria on synapse size and vesicle content\u201d they then conclude that boutons containing a mitochondrion have more vesicles. If terminals with a mitochondrion are larger there is more space to accommodate vesicles. Hence, the presence of more vesicles is not necessarily due to the presence of a mitochondrion but maybe because of the larger size? In the same vein, it is unclear why the data were not normalized to bouton volume. In the aforementioned paragraph the authors conclude that the presence (or proximity) of a mitochondrion has a positive influence on synaptic efficacy; but this measure of efficacy is simply based on the number of vesicles (and PSD area). Functional studies are needed to make such statements. These issues should be addressed by a careful rewriting of the claims made from the data."

Further down they analyze the morphology of the cristae of the mitochondria and use these results to make statements about ATP levels and production. (e.g.: \u201cthese changes in mitochondria structure indicate an ongoing elevation in demand for presynaptic ATP at 120 min after TBS-LTP\u201d). This is at best correlative and it is likely that other aspects of mitochondrial biology affect cristae structure as well. There are methods to measure ATP (also in situ) that could be used rather than having to rely on proxies to make conclusions that are unfounded. Again, careful rewriting of these sections should be performed to address these issues."

Consider the following hypothesis: there is a certain average density of mitochondria per axon volume, but mitochondria are randomly distributed in this volume, and larger boutons therefore have a larger chance of containing a mitochondrion. We know from past studies that larger (by volume) boutons also tend to contain more vesicles, contain larger and more active zones, and form stronger synapses. How about this theory as the explanation for the results shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C-F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>? The authors should compare their data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C-F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> with the predictions of a simple model of random placement of mitochondria inside the volume of their axonal reconstructions, assuming a constant mean density given by the total number of mitochondria divided by the sum of the volumes of the axons they reconstructed."

For example, in the last paragraph of the subsection \u201cMitochondria-related differences in synapse size and vesicle composition at P15</i> in vivo<i>\u201d they write that the proximity of presynaptic mitochondria supports larger synapses with more vesicles. Maybe the larger synapses are able to accommodate a mitochondrion while the smaller ones do not because of space limitations? It is not clear what is cause and what is consequence. In the last paragraph of the subsection \u201cInfluence of distance from mitochondria on synapse size and vesicle content\u201d they then conclude that boutons containing a mitochondrion have more vesicles. If terminals with a mitochondrion are larger there is more space to accommodate vesicles. Hence, the presence of more vesicles is not necessarily due to the presence of a mitochondrion but maybe because of the larger size? In the same vein, it is unclear why the data were not normalized to bouton volume. In the aforementioned paragraph the authors conclude that the presence (or proximity) of a mitochondrion has a positive influence on synaptic efficacy; but this measure of efficacy is simply based on the number of vesicles (and PSD area). Functional studies are needed to make such statements. These issues should be addressed by a careful rewriting of the claims made from the data.</i> "

Nearly 50% of the mitochondria occurred outside synaptic boutons, in nonsynaptic regions of the axon with no surrounding vesicles. The synaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria do not differ significantly from one another in their diameters. Both would easily fit even in places where there are no synapses and the axons are at their thinnest, in the inter-bouton regions (e.g. see the nonsynaptic mitochondrion of b4 in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> (3DEM), and 3B (b4, EM).

Further down they analyze the morphology of the cristae of the mitochondria and use these results to make statements about ATP levels and production. (e.g.: \u201cthese changes in mitochondria structure indicate an ongoing elevation in demand for presynaptic ATP at 120 min after TBS-LTP\u201d).
