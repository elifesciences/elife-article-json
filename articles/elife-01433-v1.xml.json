In all these contexts, the cortical network has to break symmetry to generate polar cytoskeletal dynamics. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms responsible for regulating cortical dynamics in vivo and inducing symmetry breaking are still unclear. Here we introduce a reconstituted system that self-organizes into dynamic actin cortices at the inner interface of water-in-oil emulsions. This artificial system undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking, driven by myosin-induced cortical actin flows, which appears remarkably similar to the initial polarization of the embryo in many species. Our in vitro model system recapitulates the rich dynamics of actin cortices in vivo, revealing the basic biophysical and biochemical requirements for cortex formation and symmetry breaking. Moreover, this synthetic system paves the way for further exploration of artificial cells towards the realization of minimal model systems that can move and divide."

While biochemical signaling pathways appear to be important for transducing directional cues, the instability, at least in some cases, can be primarily mechanical (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mullins, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Van Der Gucht and Sykes, 2009</a>). For example, reconstitution of actin-based motility of bacterial pathogens such as <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> revealed that directional movement can arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking within the actin network which ruptures and forms a polar comet-tail (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cameron et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Van Oudenaarden and Theriot, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Boukellal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Van Der Gucht et al., 2005</a>).

Despite their importance, the factors controlling symmetry breaking in the cell cortex remain poorly understood<i>.</i> An attractive hypothesis is that the instability leading to cortical symmetry breaking is also mechanical as in the case of comet tail motility (<a href=\"#bib43\">Van Oudenaarden and Theriot, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Van Der Gucht et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dayel et al., 2009</a>), yet the mechanisms involved appear different. Comet tail formation is a myosin\u2013independent process driven by actin polymerization (<a href=\"#bib20\">Loisel et al., 1999</a>), whereas cortical symmetry breaking appears to rely on myosin as the main force generating element; myosin contraction which generates cortical actin flows has been shown to be essential for inducing polarization and defining the anterior\u2013posterior axis during the early stages of embryogenesis in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and in other species (<a href=\"#bib27\">Munro et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Mullins, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Munro and Bowerman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Mayer et al., 2010</a>)."

Recent in vitro experiments revealed that small changes in the relative amounts of myosin and crosslinkers, or in their activity, can lead to a sharp transition in the overall contractile behavior of reconstituted actin networks (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bendix et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kohler et al., 2012</a>). However, to emulate cortical dynamics it is essential to incorporate actin turnover dynamics, couple the actin network to a soft interface (<a href=\"#bib28\">Murrell and Gardel, 2012</a>), and reproduce a cell-like geometry (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pontani et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pinot et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Carvalho et al., 2013b</a>). Recent reports (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carvalho et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2013b</a>) suggest that myosin is responsible for building tension in actin networks tethered to soft interfaces, and can induce cortical rupture and generate asymmetry. Here we report the realization of artificial actin cortices that exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking and display cell-like behavior. This novel synthetic system provides a basis for studying cortical actin dynamics and polarization in a simplified environment detached from the complexity of the living cell. Moreover, it presents an interesting example of a self-organized, far-from-equilibrium, active system that utilizes chemical energy to polarize and generate directional forces."

Such branched actin networks are found in the cortices of many cell types (<a href=\"#bib21\">Machesky et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Medalia et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bovellan, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fritzsche et al., 2013</a>). A soluble ActA construct was purified from <i>L. monocytogenes</i> and conjugated to a fluorescent hydrophobic linker made with Bodipy-FL, to generate an amphiphilic complex (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). This amphiphilic ActA complex was mixed with diluted <i>Xenopus laevis</i> egg cytoplasmic extract supplemented with labeled actin, and encapsulated within droplets surrounded by mineral oil (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The amphiphilic ActA spontaneously localized to the water\u2013oil interface following droplet formation. Upon localization, ActA induced the assembly of a cortical actin network at the inner surface of the aqueous droplets (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,D</a>). Cortex assembly initiated in patches scattered throughout the interface, consistent with the autocatalytic nature of Arp2/3 mediated actin filament nucleation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mullins and Hansen, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The system reached a steady state after \u223c10 min, with the formation of thin (\u223c1.5 \u00b5m; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), homogenous actin cortices. The assembled cortices are dynamic, as illustrated by the rapid cortical recovery following photobleaching (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Thus, the cortical steady state reflects a balance between actin assembly and disassembly at the interface, as in cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fritzsche et al., 2013</a>). Control experiments with soluble ActA, or in the absence of ActA, resulted in an essentially uniform actin distribution throughout the emulsion droplets, with no apparent cortical localization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), indicating that cortex formation depends on the localization of a nucleation-promoting factor at the interface."

The actin network assembled within emulsion droplets incubated at 20\u00b0C broke symmetry and formed polar actin caps (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), in contrast to the homogenous spherical cortices formed at higher temperature (30\u00b0C; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We followed the dynamics of actin cap formation as a function of time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Initially, actin assembly appeared nearly uniform throughout the interface, but within minutes we observed the onset of a directional actin network flow along the interface. The cap formation process developed over \u223c10\u201320 min, with cortical flows initiating at \u223c1\u20134 \u00b5m/min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), and slowing down over time, as the cap contracted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The local turnover due to actin assembly and disassembly continued throughout the cap formation process, as illustrated by photobleaching experiments in which a cortical region within the asymmetric actin cap was bleached (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Cortical recovery in the cap was observed within minutes (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), similar to the recovery seen in photobleaching experiments of homogenous cortices (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Despite this rapid turnover at the molecular level, the position of the actin caps remained stable over much longer time scales, typically exhibiting persistent polarization for hours (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Notably, the magnitude of the cortical actin flows and the characteristic length and time scales for polarization observed in our artificial cortices are similar to those seen in developing embryos (<a href=\"#bib27\">Munro et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cowan and Hyman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Munro and Bowerman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Mayer et al., 2010</a>)."

The fluorescence intensity profiles as a function of the angle along the contour are shown for different water-in-oil emulsions at 20\u00b0C (<b>A</b>; bottom panels) or at 30\u00b0C (<b>B</b>). Data for individual emulsions normalized to the mean intensity in each contour (grey lines) is shown together with the population average (thick line). The actin distributions (bottom right) are peaked at the center of the cap for all the emulsions at 20\u00b0C, in contrast to the uniform distributions at 30\u00b0C. The ActA distributions (bottom left) are essentially flat at both temperatures. The residual ActA observed outside the polar caps at 30\u00b0C suggests that ActA is in excess in our system (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). (<b>C</b>) Spinning disk confocal images from a time-lapse video (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>) showing the development of a polar actin cap in an emulsion incubated at 20\u00b0C. The time after droplet formation is indicated. Cortex assembly starts uniformly along the interface, and becomes polar within minutes. (<b>D</b>) A kymograph of the video in (<b>C</b>), showing the fluorescence intensity along the contour of the emulsion (vertical axis) as a function of time (horizontal axis). The cortical actin flow which slows down as the cap contracts is evident in the kymograph. (<b>E</b>) A histogram of the initial cortical flow speeds measured for a population (N = 32) of emulsions followed by time-lapse microscopy during the symmetry breaking process as in (<b>C</b>). Inset- a schematic illustration of the cortical actin flow during the symmetry breaking process. (<b>F</b>) Bulk assay for actin network contractility. The relative width of the actin containing strip in comparison to the width of the incubation chamber after 30 min is plotted as a function of temperature. At temperatures &lt;25\u00b0C the network contracts into a thin strip (left inset), while at higher temperatures (&gt;25\u00b0C) no bulk contractility is observed (right inset). (<b>G</b>) Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30\u00b0C to generate homogenous cortices, and then moved to 20\u00b0C. Cortex polarity developed over time, with symmetry breaking often initiating in more than one position (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). The relative proportion of symmetric (dark) and polar cortices (light) with one (bare) or multiple (stripes) actin caps, at different time windows following the temperature shift are shown, in comparison to control samples incubated at 30\u00b0C or at 20\u00b0C."

To investigate whether a temperature shift could lead to symmetry breaking in pre-assembled actin cortices, we first incubated emulsions for 30 min at 30\u00b0C to prepare homogenous cortices, and then shifted the temperature to 20\u00b0C. Cortical polarity developed as a function of time following the temperature shift (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Initially, the actin network density along the droplet interface was uniform. Within minutes, the homogenous cortical network began to rupture, often in more than one place (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>; 22\u2032), leading to the formation of gaps in the actin cortex. After \u223c30 min, a polar distribution of actin was observed in all emulsions, characterized in most cases by a single polar cap, similar to the distributions measured in emulsions prepared at 20\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). At longer times, we often observed accumulation of actin in the interior of the droplet (near the cap) driven by the actin flows initiated at the interface (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>; 75\u2032). The cortical flows also generated a bias in the distribution of the nucleation-promoting factor ActA towards the cap (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). Similar recruitment of nucleation-promoting factors by polymerizing actin networks was previously observed in comet tail motility on soft interfaces (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boukellal et al., 2004</a>)."

As expected, the ActA density at the water\u2013oil interface increased as a function of the initial bulk ActA concentration used (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). The ActA densities at the interface were also higher at 20\u00b0C, which can be understood from simple thermodynamic considerations; the dynamic localization of ActA at the interface (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>) depends on the interplay between enthalpy and entropy which favors localization at lower temperatures. However, within the range of ActA concentrations examined, the intensity of the actin cortices and their symmetry breaking properties were essentially unaffected by the ActA concentration (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5B,C</a>), suggesting that ActA is in excess. These results suggest that the temperature-dependent symmetry breaking observed reflects the changing properties of the cortical actin networks, rather than differences in ActA localization. The intensity of the actin cortices was found to be higher at lower temperatures, most likely due to the temperature-induced changes in the balance between actin assembly and disassembly dynamics in our system, also exemplified by the increased lengths of actin comet tails at 20\u00b0C compared to 30\u00b0C in the same motility mix (data not shown)."

To examine the role of myosin in our reconstituted system, we depleted myosin II from the <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts by immunodepletion (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bendix et al., 2008</a>) (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Emulsions made from myosin-depleted extracts did not exhibit cortical actin flows and maintained a symmetric actin shell when incubated at 20\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>), in contrast to the behavior observed at the same temperature in the presence of myosin. Symmetry breaking was not affected in control experiments with mock immunodepletion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). To further establish the essential role of myosin in the symmetry breaking process, we added different amounts of purified myosin to myosin\u2013depleted extracts and showed that the symmetry breaking is restored (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). The cap morphology was dependent on the amount of added myosin; as the concentration of myosin increased, we observed more cortices with multiple caps, rather than a single cap (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Moreover, at even higher myosin concentrations (0.66 \u00b5M) most of the cortices appear fractured in many places with multiple small interconnected cortical patches which exhibited jittery motion. The decrease in the typical size of cortical patches with increasing amounts of myosin is probably due to the decrease in the contractile unit size as a function of myosin concentration (<a href=\"#bib40\">Thoresen et al., 2013</a>). Overall our results suggest that the symmetry breaking observed in our artificial cortices is driven by the same myosin-induced mechanism found in cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Munro et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Mayer et al., 2010</a>)."

We used two different kinds of actin crosslinkers which are known to localize to cortical actin networks in vivo (<a href=\"#bib7\">Charras et al., 2006</a>), \u03b1-actinin which preferentially generates anti-parallel actin bundles and filamin which is a more flexible crosslinker that can bind to disordered actin networks. We showed that symmetry breaking can be induced at 30\u00b0C by adding crosslinkers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Increasing \u03b1-actinin concentration led to the formation of polar cortices in a concentration dependent manner. At low concentrations (&lt;4 \u00b5M) the cortices remained largely symmetric, at intermediate concentrations (4\u20136 \u00b5M) we mostly observed the formation of a single actin cap, while at higher concentrations (8 \u00b5M) we often observed multiple actin domains. Addition of filamin (4 \u00b5M) also led to the formation of a polar actin cap. Despite the different properties of these crosslinkers, they were both successful at inducing symmetry breaking, highlighting the importance of the overall connectivity of the network rather than the detailed characteristics of individual crosslinkers."

The cortex, which is under contractile stress, could spontaneously detach from the interface locally (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), as observed in vivo during cellular blebbing (<a href=\"#bib7\">Charras et al., 2006</a>). Detachment of the cortex did not lead to outward bulging of the interface due to the high surface tension of the water\u2013oil interface in our system (\u223c700 pN/\u00b5m, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). As in cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Charras et al., 2006</a>), the actin cortex healed over time and a new cortex assembled at the interface within minutes. In addition, the asymmetric actin cortices generated polar forces which could induce reorganization in the interior of the droplet and global deformation of the droplet\u2019s shape (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Such deformations were observed in \u223c10% of the emulsions, and their incidence increased after longer incubation times compared to the initial polarization event. Similar reorganization and changes in global morphology have been observed in cells and embryos (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Munro and Bowerman, 2009</a>). The shape deformation of the droplet can be used to measure the forces generated by the cortical actin network (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boukellal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

Away from the tip, on the sides of the actin cap, the local curvature is lower implying that the cytoskeleton is exerting pulling forces on the interface.

                        "text": "In this work we present a novel reconstituted system that self-organizes into dynamic actin cortices which exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking in the absence of any directional cue. Our system integrates actin assembly at the interface, actin turnover, myosin motor activity and crosslinkers within a confined geometry, and displays interesting cell-like behavior. The water-in-oil emulsions provide an easy and reproducible approach to generate cell-like compartments (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tawfik and Griffiths, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pinot et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Good et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hazel et al., 2013</a>). Giant vesicles (GUVs) have also been used as compartments for reconstituting cellular phenomena (<a href=\"#bib29\">Noireaux and Libchaber, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Pontani et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Carvalho et al., 2013b</a>). Both approaches have their advantages and limitations; encapsulation in GUVs is more challenging and the GUVs limited stability in cell extracts can be problematic, while the use of oil-based emulsions limits the applicability of various cell permeable biochemical drugs (e.g., blebbistatin) which tend to be hydrophobic and segregate into the oil phase. In addition, the actin machinery within emulsions appears more sensitive to phototoxicity effects, probably due to elevated oxygen levels within the emulsions compared to bulk. Despite these limitations, our system offers new possibilities for studying cytoskeletal dynamics; we are able to vary the identity and concentrations of actin nucleators, myosin motors and crosslinkers within a controlled environment, and follow their dynamics over time. Using this novel reconstituted system we show that the assembly of dynamic actin cortices requires localization of nucleation factors at the interface, and identify the conditions for cortical symmetry breaking. Specifically, we show that symmetry breaking requires myosin motors and sufficient network connectivity, but does not depend upon pre-patterned localization of actin nucleators, the involvement of microtubules (<a href=\"#bib27\">Munro et al., 2004</a>), or any local changes in the properties of the interface."

Obviously, temperature is a convenient control parameter. Experimentally, this allowed us to show that cortical polarization can be induced at high temperature by adding crosslinkers and prevented at low temperature by depleting myosin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), implying that symmetry breaking in the artificial cortices is driven by contraction of the cortical actomyosin network. This contractile behavior observed at low temperatures is consistent with previous experiments in cell extracts which were all done at temperatures below 20\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bendix et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Field et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pinot et al., 2012</a>). At 30\u00b0C the cortical network appears weakly crosslinked, and hence unable to transmit the contractile stresses generated by myosin motor activity. Visualization of the ultrastructure of the actin networks could provide additional insight into the mechanism of symmetry breaking. However, analysis of actin structures by electron microscopy within cell-like compartments is technically challenging due to difficulties in fixation and sample preparation. We hypothesize that the transition to contractile behavior at lower temperature is primarily due to an increase in the intrinsic crosslinking activity in the system. This increase could emerge from longer dwell times of individual myosin motor heads at low temperature, which would turn the multi-motor myosin filaments into more effective crosslinkers. Alternatively, decreasing temperature could increase the affinity of endogenous actin crosslinkers. Our observations are analogous to recent results, which revealed a sharp transition in the contractile behavior of active actin networks as a function of pH (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kohler et al., 2012</a>). Overall these findings indicate that actin cortices are close to an instability threshold; small changes in the composition of the system, or in the activity of its components, can lead to dramatic changes in the global characteristics of the system. We believe that this reflects a general organizational principle in cellular systems, whereby cells are often posed near an instability threshold to enable rapid responses to changing conditions."

Reconstituting different functional modules together in a meaningful way can be invaluable in that respect, but such reconstitutions have proven to be challenging experimentally. Here we report the successful integration of different cytoskeletal modules into a single reconstituted system which recapitulates several cellular phenomena including cortical symmetry breaking (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a>), polar force generation, and blebbing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Our reconstituted system provides novel insights into the complex behavior of the actin cortex in living cells, presenting new opportunities for investigating cortical dynamics, both experimentally and theoretically (<a href=\"#bib17\">Joanny et al., 2013</a>). More generally, our system opens the way for future exploration of cytoskeletal dynamics within cell-like compartments, and the integration of additional modules, such as protein expression systems (<a href=\"#bib29\">Noireaux and Libchaber, 2004</a>) and cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib14\">Good et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hazel et al., 2013</a>), towards the realization of artificial cells that can move and divide.

In brief, anti-myosin antibody raised against a C-terminal peptide of <i>Xenopus</i> myosin II-A heavy chain (a gift from Aaron Straight, Stanford University) or random rabbit IgG (#011-00-003; Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were covalently bound to protein-A Dynabeads (#100-02; Dynal Biotech, Grand Island, NY) and resuspended in XB. The extract was incubated with the conjugated Dynabeads for two sequential depletion rounds of 10 min each at RT, and used immediately."

We estimate the total actin concentration in the motility mix to be \u223c25 \u00b5M. Emulsions were made by adding 1% (vol/vol) motility mix to mineral oil (Sigma) containing 4% Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethiocone (Abil EM90; Evnok Industries, Essen, Germany) and stirring for 2 min at room temperature. The oil and surfactant mixture was degassed under vacuum overnight prior to use to reduce phototoxicity. Samples were made in chambers assembled from a glass slide and a coverslip which was passivated with trichloromethyl silane (Sigma), and sealed with vaseline:lanolin:paraffin (at 1:1:1). Samples were either imaged immediately (for time-lapse videos) or incubated for 30 min at the indicated temperature and then imaged for population analysis. The surface tension between the aqueous and the oil phase was measured using the pendant-drop assay. An extract containing droplet was injected into an oil cuvette, and the droplet was imaged from the side to determine its shape. The surface tension was determined by analyzing the shape of the droplet using standard procedures."

Images were acquired using 488 nm and 561 nm laser illumination and appropriate emission filters in a temperature controlled incubator. Images on the spinning disk confocal were collected with an EM-CCD (QuantEM; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Images of emulsions were typically taken at a single plane at \u223c1/3 of the emulsion height, since imaging at the mid-plane or higher suffered from optical artifacts due to the differences in the indices of refraction between the water and oil phase. Bright field images were taken at the mid-plane. Quantitative image analysis was done using the Celltool package developed by Zach Pincus (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pincus and Theriot, 2007</a>) and custom code written in Matlab. Analysis was done on emulsions with a diameter of 30\u201380 \u00b5m.

They establish a water-in-oil emulsion made with a fluorescent version of the Listeria ActA, Xenopus egg extract and fluorescent actin and first show that actin polymerization and an actin cortex develops around at the periphery of the interface between the oil-aqueous media. Interestingly, they find that at lower temperatures (approx. 20\u00b0C) the actin network breaks symmetry and generates a cap, which does not happen at higher temperatures. Incubation with myosin II antibodies blocks symmetry breaking and crosslinking is required. Although the establishment of this new reconstituted cortex is interesting and the result with myosin II potentially the novel finding the work is not developed enough to warrant publication in <i>eLife</i>. In particular, several conclusions are made too loosely. Also, while the water-in-oil approach is new, it does not go well over and above the system characterized by Theriot and van Oudenaarden groups on symmetry breaking in ActA-coated beads as far as an in vitro non-cell system is concerned."

I am not sure if blebbistatin works on Xenopus myosin II. If not, they can first supplement the extract with human myosin II (after depletion of Xenopus myosin II) followed by blebbistatin addition.

This is a very interesting finding. However, the conclusion relies on a single experiment: the immunodepletion of myosin II-A heavy chain in the extracts. It is unclear how much myosin is really depleted using this method, other myosins are likely to be present in the extract, and there is no experimental evidence that myosin really localizes to the cortex in this system. To truly conclude on the importance of contractility, it seems essential to use some alternative method to test the functional importance of myosin activity. Is it possible to use drugs (such as blebbistatin) in this system? Alternatively, could the localization and dynamics of myosin be imaged during symmetry breaking?"

The authors speculate that this might be due to the relatively high tension of the droplet interface, which they estimate at 700 pN/\u03bcm. Could they give details on how this tension was measured? This tension is indeed rather high, but not that much higher than tension measured by the same group in migrating keratocytes (Lieber et al. 2013). Was any deformation observed in the droplets at higher temperature, where polarization was induced by addition of crosslinkers? One would expect that interfacial tension would be lower at a higher temperature."

The symmetry breaking of the actin network studied by Theriot and van Oudenaarden as well as by other groups (e.g., Sykes group, Mullins group) is entirely different. While in both cases the system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking in vitro, the mechanism is not the same. In particular, the force generating mechanism is different; actin polymerization is essential and sufficient for symmetry breaking of beads and the formation of comet tails. This is demonstrated in reconstitution experiments which contain only actin nucleators and actin polymerization factors, but do not contain myosin (<a href=\"#bib20\">Loisel et al. 1999</a>). The symmetry breaking we observe in artificial cortices, which is similar to the symmetry breaking observed in a developing embryo, is dependent on myosin motors as a force generator. As shown by us in vitro and by others in vivo (<a href=\"#bib27\">Munro et al. 2004</a>), myosin is essential for this process and actin polymerization alone does not lead to symmetry breaking. As such, the conditions for symmetry breaking and the mechanisms involved are substantially different. Thus, while both systems demonstrate interesting emergent behavior and polarize spontaneously, we do not agree that the systems are equivalent as far as a non-cellular system for symmetry breaking."

First, small molecule inhibitors like blebbistatin are known to be significantly less effective in cell extracts (Fields, Mitchison et al. Methods in Enzymology, in press), with inhibition typically requiring 10-1000 fold higher doses in comparison to cell culture. Second, cell-permeable small molecule inhibitors are typically hydrophobic and thus partition mostly into the oil phase in our emulsion system. Indeed, when we tried to use blebbistatin in our system we found that it partitions primarily into the oil phase (evident by its yellowish color which colors the oil phase) and the residual amounts of blebbistatin in the aqueous phase had no detectable effect on myosin function. Thus while myosin inhibition with blebbistatin would in principle be a simple and informative experiment, it is not feasible in our emulsion system. However, given that we were able to show that symmetry breaking does not occur in myosin depleted extracts, and is restored by add-back of purified myosin, we believe that the essential role of myosin in cortical symmetry breaking is already well-substantiated by our results."

This behavior is very reminiscent of in vivo observations in developing embryo, where similarly cortical flows are observed mainly at the interface, but appear to drive contraction of a much sparser actin network within the cytoplasm. As mentioned earlier, sample preparation for electron microscopy is challenging with the emulsion system. In particular, it is not possible to chemically fix the cortices within the emulsions."

These structures are not observed in homogenous cortices after similar incubation times. Similarly, these structures are not seen during cortex formation at shorter incubation times (&lt; 30 min). However, discrete puncta of ActA are always present in the extract. This is not surprising, since the extracts are known to contain lipids and small vesicles and the amphiphilic ActA will localize to these sites. Since the aggregates appear only in emulsions which display contractile behavior, we believe that these structures arise due to the contraction of a sparse network of actin filaments nucleated around these small vesicles or present in the bulk of the emulsions. This network probably pulls small ActA coated vesicles with it as it contracts. Using a lipid dye will probably not be very informative since it will likely exhibit some colocalization with the amphiphilic ActA molecules regardless of the nature of the internal structures observed"

We believe that careful dose-dependent characterization of different crosslinkers and analysis of the behavior of the system at different pH values (as beautifully done in the work by Kohler et al. from the Bausch lab) is beyond the scope of the current manuscript."
