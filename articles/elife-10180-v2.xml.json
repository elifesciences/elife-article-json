ATP synthases operate by a rotary catalytic mechanism where proton translocation through the membrane-inserted F<sub>O</sub> region is coupled to ATP synthesis in the catalytic F<sub>1</sub> region via rotation of a central rotor subcomplex. We report here single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of the bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase. Combining cryo-EM data with bioinformatic analysis allowed us to determine the fold of the a subunit, suggesting a proton translocation path through the F<sub>O</sub> region that involves both the a and b subunits. 3D classification of images revealed seven distinct states of the enzyme that show different modes of bending and twisting in the intact ATP synthase. Rotational fluctuations of the c<sub>8</sub>-ring within the F<sub>O</sub> region support a Brownian ratchet mechanism for proton-translocation-driven rotation in ATP synthases."

ATP synthases operate by a rotary catalytic mechanism where proton translocation through the membrane-inserted F<sub>O</sub> region is coupled to ATP synthesis in the catalytic F<sub>1</sub> region via rotation of a central rotor subcomplex. We report here single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of the bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase. Combining cryo-EM data with bioinformatic analysis allowed us to determine the fold of the a subunit, suggesting a proton translocation path through the F<sub>O</sub> region that involves both the a and b subunits. 3D classification of images revealed seven distinct states of the enzyme that show different modes of bending and twisting in the intact ATP synthase. Rotational fluctuations of the c<sub>8</sub>-ring within the F<sub>O</sub> region support a Brownian ratchet mechanism for proton-translocation-driven rotation in ATP synthases."

The ATP synthase is found in the inner membranes of mitochondria, with the F<sub>1</sub> region in the mitochondrial matrix and the F<sub>O</sub> region accessible from the inter-membrane space between the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes. In the mammalian enzyme, the subunit composition is \u03b1<sub>3</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub>\u03b3\u03b4\u03b5 for the F<sub>1\u00a0</sub>region with subunits a, e, f, g, A6L, DAPIT, a 6.8 kDa proteolipid, two membrane-inserted \u03b1-helices of subunit b, and the c<sub>8</sub>-ring forming the F<sub>O</sub> region (<a href=\"#bib50\">Walker, 2013</a>). The rotor subcomplex consists of subunits \u03b3,\u00a0\u03b4,\u00a0\u03b5, and the c<sub>8</sub>-ring. In addition to the rotor, the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>O</sub> regions are linked by a peripheral stalk composed of subunits OSCP, d, F<sub>6</sub>, and the hydrophilic portion of subunit b. Approximately 85% of the structure of the complex is known at high resolution from X-ray crystallography\u00a0of constituent proteins, which have been assembled into a mosaic structure within the constraints of a cryo-EM map at 18 \u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#bib50\">Walker, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2012</a>)."

While the mechanism by which ATP synthesis and hydrolysis are coupled to rotation of the\u00a0\u03b3 subunit is now understood well (<a href=\"#bib50\">Walker, 2013</a>), it is still unresolved how rotation of the central rotor is coupled to proton translocation through the F<sub>O</sub> region. The most popular model suggests that proton translocation occurs through two offset half channels near the a subunit/c subunit interface (<a href=\"#bib23\">Junge et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">Junge, 2005</a>). In this model, one half channel allows protons to move half-way across the lipid bilayer in order to protonate the conserved Glu58 residue of one of the c subunits. The other half channel allows deprotonation of the adjacent c subunit (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lau and Rubinstein, 2012</a>), setting up the necessary condition for a net rotation of the entire c-ring. Rotation does not occur directly from the protonating half channel to the deprotonating half channel, but in the opposite direction so that the protonated, and therefore uncharged, Glu residues traverse through the lipid environment before reaching the deprotonating half channel. The deprotonated Glu residue prevents the ring from rotating in the opposite direction, which would place the charged residue in the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer. Rotation of the c-ring occurs due to\u00a0Brownian motion, making the enzyme a Brownian ratchet."

This arrangement of \u03b1-helices from the a and c subunits was also seen in the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> V-type ATPase (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhao et al., 2015a</a>). Cryo-EM of the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> V-ATPase demonstrated that images of rotary ATPases could be separated by 3D classification to reveal conformations of the complex that exist simultaneously in solution. In the work described here, we obtained and analyzed cryo-EM images of the bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase. 3D classification of the images resulted in seven distinct maps of the enzyme, each showing the complex in a different conformation. By averaging the density for the proton-translocating a subunit from the seven maps, we generated a map segment that shows \u03b1-helices clearly. Analysis of evolutionary covariance in the sequence of the a subunit (<a href=\"#bib19\">G\u00f6bel et al., 1994</a>) allowed the entire a subunit polypeptide to be traced through the density map. The resulting atomic model for the a subunit was fitted into the maps for the different rotational states, suggesting a path for protons through the enzyme and supporting the Brownian ratchet mechanism for the generation of rotation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Junge et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">2005</a>), and thereby ATP synthesis, in ATP synthases."

Initial 3D classification produced three classes, each of which appear to show a \u223c120\u00b0 rotation of the central rotor within the F<sub>1</sub> region of the complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, blue arrows), similar to what was seen previously with the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> V-ATPase (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhao, et al., 2015a</a>). Further classification of these three rotational states was able to separate state 1 into two sub-states, subsequently referred to as states 1a and 1b. State 2 could be divided into states 2a, 2b, and 2c, while state 3 could be separated into states 3a and 3b.

While the rotational states of the yeast V-ATPase were found to be populated unequally after 3D classification, bovine ATP synthase classes corresponding to different positions of the rotor had approximately equal populations.

This bent structure was seen previously in a lower-resolution cryo-EM map of the bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2010</a>). It is consistent with electron tomograms of ATP synthases in mitochondrial membranes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Strauss, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Davies et al., 2011</a>) and was also observed recently by electron tomography of membrane-reconstituted 2D crystals of the bovine enzyme (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jiko et al., 2015</a>). The e and g subunits are expected to reside in the portion of the F<sub>O</sub> region distal to the c<sub>8</sub>-ring because cryo-EM maps of the mitochondrial ATP synthase from <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, where subunits e and g were removed by detergent, lacked this bent portion (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lau et al., 2008</a>). The f subunit is also thought to be associated with the e and g subunits (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belogrudov et al., 1996</a>). DAPIT and the 6.8 kDa proteolipid are not expected to be present in this preparation because the necessary lipids for maintaining their association were not added during purification (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Carroll, 2009</a>). While a detergent micelle can be seen around the entire F<sub>O</sub> region, the portion of F<sub>O</sub> distal to the c<sub>8</sub>-ring also contains a feature with unusually low density (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, white arrows). The content of this low-density region is uncertain. Low density in cryo-EM maps\u00a0is often due to partial occupancy, flexibility, or disorder of a protein subunit. However, the low-density feature here\u00a0is bounded on one side by unusually sharp density from the detergent micelle, suggesting more order than in the rest of the micelle, and on the other side by the a subunit, which also appears well ordered. Therefore, the low density region\u00a0could be due to bound material with low density, possibly lipid, that remains after purification of the enzyme."

The feature appears to consist of an elongated membrane-embedded density, possibly an \u03b1-helix, that extends from the rotor-distal portion of F<sub>O</sub> to the c<sub>8</sub>-ring. The orientation of this density would cause it to pass through the inter-membrane space of the mitochondrion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and C</a>, orange arrow). While not identified in the previous cryo-EM map of the enzyme at 18 \u00c5 resolution, the structure is consistent with a poorly-resolved ridge along the surface of the\u00a0F<sub>O</sub> region seen in the earlier map (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2012</a>). Because it extends from the bent end of the F<sub>O</sub> region, this feature may correspond to the soluble part of the e subunit. Indeed, a similar structure was observed in single particle EM of negatively stained ATP synthase dimers from bovine heart mitochondria, and was proposed to be interacting e subunits (<a href=\"#bib31\">Minauro-Sanmiguel et al., 2005</a>). However, in the present structure the feature is not positioned to interact between dimers of the enzyme and its role in the complex remains unclear."

Averaging maps increases the signal-to-noise ratio where the structures are similar, but blurs regions where the maps differ. In principle, this method could also be applied to other map regions of the ATP synthase or other heterogeneous protein complexes by applying an appropriate transform before averaging. Averaging the F<sub>O</sub> region provides a clear view of the portion of the\u00a0F<sub>O</sub> region adjacent to the rotor, allowing the trans-membrane \u03b1-helices from the a, b, and A6L subunits to be identified reliably (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a>, green arrows, and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The c-ring has a lower density in the averaged membrane region than in the original maps, suggesting that its position differs between maps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a>, purple arrows). The averaged density for the F<sub>O</sub> region revealed the a subunit to have five membrane-inserted \u03b1-helices and an additional \u03b1-helix along the plane of the membrane surface (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

Analysis of covariance in evolutionarily related protein sequences can identify pairs of residues in a protein structure that are likely to interact physically with each other (<a href=\"#bib19\">G\u00f6bel et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cronet et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hopf et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ovchinnikov et al., 2014</a>). Spatial constraints from covariance analysis were sufficient not only to identify tentatively trans-membrane \u03b1-helices of the a subunit that are adjacent to each other, but also suggest which face each \u03b1-helix presents to the other \u03b1-helices (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, red lines). The constraints show patterns of interaction consistent with the predicted\u00a0\u03b1-helical structure of the a subunit (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), as well as interactions between the a subunit and the outer \u03b1-helix of a c subunit in the c<sub>8</sub>-ring (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). As a result, we were able to trace the path of the a subunit polypeptide through the cryo-EM density map. The fit of the \u03b1-helices in the a subunit density was improved by molecular dynamics flexible fitting (<i>MDFF</i>) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Trabuco et al., 2008</a>) and the 34 residue long connecting loop from residues 115 to 148 was built with <i>Rosetta</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rohl et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). This connecting loop was built to be physically reasonable, but because its structure is not derived from experimental data it is not included in the discussion below. The final model places the \u03b1\u00a0carbons of the residues in the co-varying pairs within 15 \u00c5 of each other in 94% of the top 90 identified pairs, with an average C<sub>\u03b1</sub> to C<sub>\u03b1</sub> distance of 10.3 \u00c5. The 6% of constraints that are violated by the model are consistent with the false positive rate observed when testing covariance analysis approaches with proteins of known structure (<a href=\"#bib28\">Marks et al., 2011</a>)."

The N terminus of the subunit is in the inter-membrane space of the mitochondrion. The first \u03b1-helix extends vertically across the F<sub>O</sub> region distal to the contact of the a subunit and c<sub>8</sub>-ring. The two trans-membrane \u03b1-helices of the b subunit are packed against one surface of helix #1 while the single trans-membrane \u03b1-helix from the A6L subunit is packed against its opposite surface. The second density region, interpreted as an \u03b1-helix of the a subunit, is not membrane-inserted and extends along the matrix surface of the F<sub>O</sub> region connecting the membrane-inserted \u03b1-helix #1 with a membrane-inserted helical-hairpin composed of \u03b1-helices #3 and #4. This hairpin of the third and fourth \u03b1-helices does not appear to cross the F<sub>O</sub> region fully, as seen previously in the <i>Polytomella</i> sp. ATP synthase (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allegretti et al., 2015</a>). The final two trans-membrane helices are the two highly tilted \u03b1-helices seen previously with the <i>Polytomella</i> sp.

Within this structure, Arg159, which is essential and completely conserved, is found near the middle of the long tilted \u03b1-helix #5\u00a0nearer the inter-membrane space side of the F<sub>O</sub> region, different from its predicted position in the <i>Polytomella</i> sp.\u00a0enzyme (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allegretti et al., 2015</a>)."

Residues for the b subunit were extended from the N terminus of the b subunit crystal structure into the membrane region based on trans-membrane \u03b1-helix prediction. While <i>MDFF</i> with maps in this resolution range cannot be used to determine the locations or conformations of amino acid side chains, loops, or random-coil segments of models, it can show the positioning of \u03b1-helices in the structures. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A and B</a> compare the fitting for state 1a (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and state 1b (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), illustrating the accuracy with which\u00a0\u03b1-helical segments could be resolved in the maps of different sub-states. The atomic model alone for state 1a is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, with the c<sub>8</sub>-ring removed for clarity in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>. Transitions between the different states were illustrated by linear interpolation (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). As seen previously for the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> V-ATPase, almost all of the subunits in the enzyme undergo conformational changes on transition between states (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhao, et al., 2015a</a>). Because there were two sub-states identified for states 1 and 3 there is only a single sub-state to sub-state transition for these two states. In comparison, three different sub-states were identified for state 2 and consequently there are three sub-state to sub-state transitions that are possible for this state. All of the sub-state to sub-state transitions include a slight rotation of the c<sub>8</sub>-ring against the a subunit. It is possible that this movement is due to partial disruption of the subunit a/c<sub>8</sub>-ring interface. However, the structural differences within the F<sub>O</sub> regions of different classes are significantly smaller than the structural differences seen elsewhere in the enzyme, suggesting that these changes do not originate from disruption within the membrane region of the complex and instead reflect flexibility in the enzyme."

A comparison of the maps for the different sub-states and the axes of these rotations are shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The resulting conformational changes can be seen most clearly in <a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">5.</a> The state 1a to 1b transition reveals a bending of the peripheral stalk towards the top of the F<sub>1</sub> region near the OSCP and F<sub>6</sub> subunits (<a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">5</a>, panel A). In comparison, the state 3a to 3b transition reveals bending of the peripheral stalk near where the b subunit enters the membrane (<a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">5</a>, panel D). Transitions between the three sub-states of state 2 show both motions: the transition between 2a and 2b shows mostly bending of the peripheral stalk near OSCP and F<sub>6</sub> subunits, while the 2b and 2c transition shows mostly bending near the membrane-inserted portion of the peripheral stalk (<a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">5</a>, panels B and C, respectively). The transition from state 2a to 2c shows a combined bending at both of these positions. It is most likely that the different modes of bending exist in all of the states and further classification of larger datasets would be expected to reveal these complex motions. The different sub-states do not appear to have a specific sequence or represent specific intermediates in the catalytic\u00a0rotation sequence. Instead, the differences in conformation between sub-states when taken together illustrate the flexibility of the enzyme, a property that has been linked to its rapid rate of enzymatic activity (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhao, et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>).

Nonetheless, features in the structure of the bovine mitochondrial F<sub>O</sub> region suggest a possible path for proton translocation similar to a model put forward based on the structure of the <i>Polytomella</i> sp. ATP synthase (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allegretti et al., 2015</a>). The arrangement of \u03b1-helices in the F<sub>O</sub> region is remarkably similar to the arrangement of \u03b1-helices in the V<sub>O</sub> region of the yeast V-ATPase (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhao, et al., 2015a</a>), even though the V-ATPase a subunit has eight \u03b1-helices and little detectable sequence similarity with the F-type ATP synthase a subunit. The conserved general architecture of the membrane-inserted regions in F-type ATP synthases and V-type ATPases suggests that the observed arrangement of \u03b1-helices is functionally important and likely involved in proton translocation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). The matrix half channel of the ATP synthase is likely to be formed by the cavity between the c<sub>8</sub>-ring and the matrix ends of tilted\u00a0\u03b1-helices #5 and #6 of the a subunit. The lumenal half channel in the V-ATPase is probably formed entirely from \u03b1-helices from the a subunit, whereas the corresponding inter-membrane space half channel in the ATP synthase is likely composed of the inter-membrane space ends of \u03b1-helices #5 and #6 and one or both of the two trans-membrane \u03b1-helices of the b subunit. Defining the exact placement of half channels will likely require higher-resolution maps from cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography that reveal amino acid side chain density and bound water molecules."

This lack of a rigid interaction between the c<sub>8</sub>-ring and a subunit is consistent with the Brownian ratchet model of proton translocation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Junge et al., 1997</a>). In the Brownian ratchet model, the rotational position of the ring fluctuates due to Brownian motion, but the\u00a0ring\u00a0cannot turn to place the Glu58 residue of a c subunit into the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer until the Glu58 is protonated at\u00a0the inter-membrane space half\u00a0channel. Therefore, with this model, the different sub-states would correspond to energetically equivalent or nearly-equivalent conformations that occur due to Brownian motion. <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a> illustrates the extent of rotational oscillation predicted from the transition between states 2a and 2c. It is most likely that this oscillation occurs as each c subunit passes the interface with the a subunit, with 8/3 c subunits on average contributing to the synthesis of one ATP molecule. The rotational flexibility of the c<sub>8</sub>-ring that exists even when the\u00a0\u03b3 subunit is locked within the\u00a0\u03b1<sub>3</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> hexamer\u00a0suggests that flexing and bending of the components of the ATP synthase smooths the coupling of the 8-step rotation of the c<sub>8</sub>-ring with the 3-step rotation of the F<sub>1</sub> region. This model suggests that the observed flexibility in the enzyme, which apparently complicates determination of atomic resolution structures directly from cryo-EM data, is also essential to the mechanism of ATP synthesis."

Particle images were selected in <i>Relion</i> and subjected to 2D classification (<a href=\"#bib44\">Scheres, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Scheres, 2012</a>), yielding a set of 195,233 single particle coordinates selected from 5,825 movies. Local beam-induced motion was corrected for each particle with the program <i>alignparts_lmbfgs (</i><a href=\"#bib40\">Rubinstein and Brubaker, 2015</a>). Aligned dose-fractionated particle images were filtered and summed to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio at all spatial frequencies (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grant and Grigorieff, 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rubinstein and Brubaker, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2010</a>), giving a set of particle images that were 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256 pixels. These images were down-sampled to 128\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0128 pixels (pixel size of 3.28 \u00c5) for determining particle orientations."

The final classification yielded 12 classes, of which 7 gave interpretable 3D maps. Only spatial frequencies up to 1/10 \u00c5<sup>-1</sup> were used during refinement to avoid fitting noise to high-resolution features in maps. All seven 3D maps had Fourier shell correlation values greater than 0.8 at this frequency."

These \u03b1-helices were fit manually in the map of the average F<sub>O</sub> region in the only orientations that satisfied constraints from evolutionary covariance analysis. For illustration, but not interpretation, loops connecting these helices were also included in the model. Randomly structured connecting loops between the \u03b1-helices were built with <i>Modeller</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eswar et al., 2006</a>) within <i>UCSF Chimera</i> and fitted into the density with <i>MDFF</i> with a low density scaling factor (gscale = 0.3) over 200,000 steps (200 ps). Bond lengths and angles were then idealized with <i>Rosetta</i> (idealize_jd2 command) and the loop between residues 115 and 148 rebuilt in <i>Rosetta</i> (loopmodel command) using the quick_ccd method of remodelling (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dimaio et al., 2009</a>). Each output structure included an all-atom relaxation in the density map with a score weight of 0.1. The lowest-energy model of 100 models was selected and angles were idealized and the structure energy-minimized with <i>UCSF Chimera</i>. Loops beside the one from residues 115 and 148 were too short for this process to be useful. The b subunit crystal structure was extended into the F<sub>O</sub> region of the map based on trans-membrane \u03b1-helix prediction from MEMSAT-SVM (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nugent and Jones, 2009</a>)."

The authors took full advantages of single particle cryo-EM for dealing samples with significant conformational heterogeneity, and identified seven different conformational states of the ATP synthase enzyme. The resolutions of these cryo-EM reconstructions are in the sub-nanometer range, sufficient to resolve most, if not all, secondary structural features. The flexible fitting is well described, and the restriction of interpretation to well-resolved helices is laudable. The requested revisions below are purely at the level of presentation and should be straightforward to implement."
