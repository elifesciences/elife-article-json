Here, we show that evolution along the fungal lineage was punctuated by the early acquisition and entrainment of the SBF transcription factor through horizontal gene transfer. Cell cycle evolution in the fungal ancestor then proceeded through a hybrid network containing both SBF and its ancestral animal counterpart E2F, which is still maintained in many basal fungi. We hypothesize that a virally-derived SBF may have initially hijacked cell cycle control by activating transcription via the <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements targeted by the ancestral cell cycle regulator E2F, much like extant viral oncogenes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that SBF can regulate promoters with E2F binding sites in budding yeast."

Here, we show that evolution along the fungal lineage was punctuated by the early acquisition and entrainment of the SBF transcription factor through horizontal gene transfer. Cell cycle evolution in the fungal ancestor then proceeded through a hybrid network containing both SBF and its ancestral animal counterpart E2F, which is still maintained in many basal fungi. We hypothesize that a virally-derived SBF may have initially hijacked cell cycle control by activating transcription via the <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements targeted by the ancestral cell cycle regulator E2F, much like extant viral oncogenes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that SBF can regulate promoters with E2F binding sites in budding yeast."

The broad distribution of these viral SBF-like proteins suggests that they arose first in viruses, and a fungal ancestor acquired one such protein during a viral infection. As SBF and E2F bind similar DNA sequences, Medina et al. hypothesized that this viral SBF hijacked control of the cell cycle in the fungal ancestor by controlling expression of genes that were originally controlled only by E2F. In support of this idea, experiments showed that many E2F binding sites in modern genes are also SBF binding sites, and that E2F sites can substitute for SBF sites in SBF-controlled genes. Future experiments in zoosporic fungi, which have animal-like and fungal-like features, would provide a glimpse of how a fungal ancestor may have used both SBF and E2F. These experiments may also reveal why most fungi have retained the newer SBF but lost the ancestral and widely conserved E2F protein."

In animal cells, Cyclin D, in complex with either Cdk4 or Cdk6, initiates cell cycle entry by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein, pRb. This begins the inactivation of pRb and the concomitant activation of the E2F transcription factors that induce transcription of downstream cyclins E and A, which complete the inhibition of pRb thereby forming a positive feedback loop (<a href=\"#bib16\">Bertoli et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, in budding yeast, the G1 cyclin Cln3-Cdk1 complex initiates the transition by phosphorylating and partially inactivating Whi5, an inhibitor of the SBF transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib22\">Costanzo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">de Bruin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Nasmyth and Dirick, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Ogas et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Sidorova and Breeden, 1993</a>). This allows for SBF-dependent transcription of the downstream G1 cyclins <i>CLN1</i> and <i>CLN2</i>, which also inactivate Whi5 to complete a positive feedback loop (<a href=\"#bib77\">Skotheim et al., 2008</a>).

Furthermore, no member of the transcription factor complex SBF-Whi5 exhibits amino acid sequence identity or structural similarity to any member of the E2F-pRb complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Cross et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Hasan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Taylor et al., 1997</a>). Finally, Cdk inhibitors such as Sic1 and p27 play analogous roles in yeast and mammals despite a total lack of sequence identity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Cross et al., 2011</a>). Taken together, these examples imply significant evolution of cell cycle regulatory proteins in fungi and/or animals while the network topology remains largely intact. Although identification of network topology is restricted to a few model organisms and is not as broad as sequence analysis, the similar network topology in budding yeast and animals suggests that this feature is more conserved than the constituent regulatory proteins (<a href=\"#bib24\">Cross et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Doonan and Kitsios, 2009</a>)."

Identifying the LECA repertoire helps establish that the emergence of SBF-Whi5 is abrupt and distinguishes fungi from all other eukaryotes. We show that basal fungi can have both ancestral E2F-pRb and fungal SBF-Whi5 components. Thus, fungal evolution appears to have proceeded through a hybrid network before abruptly losing the ancestral components in the lineage leading to Dikarya. This supports the hypothesis that network structure, rather than the individual components, has been conserved through the transition to fungi and argues against the case of convergent evolution."

We show that SBF can regulate promoters with E2F binding sites in budding yeast. We then use high-throughput in vitro binding assay data to elucidate the shared nucleotide preferences of E2F and SBF for DNA binding. These data suggest that a viral SBF may have initially hijacked cell cycle control, activating transcription via the <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements targeted by the ancestral cell cycle regulator E2F, much like extant viral oncogenes."

Indeed, all sequenced eukaryotic lineages have lost entire gene families that were present in LECA (<a href=\"#bib39\">Fritz-Laylin et al., 2010</a>). In contrast to the growing consensus that LECA had an extensive repertoire of proteins, the prevailing view of the cell cycle in LECA is that it was based on a simple oscillator constructed with relatively few components (<a href=\"#bib23\">Coudreuse and Nurse, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Nasmyth, 1995</a>). According to the \u2018simple\u2019 LECA cell cycle model, an ancestral oscillation in Cyclin B-Cdk1 activity drove periodic DNA replication and DNA segregation, while other aspects of cell cycle regulation, such as G1 control, may have subsequently evolved in specific lineages. The model was motivated by the fact that Cdk activity of a single Cyclin B is sufficient to drive embryonic cell cycles in frogs (<a href=\"#bib67\">Murray and Kirschner, 1989</a>) and fission yeast (<a href=\"#bib80\">Stern and Nurse, 1996</a>), and that many yeast G1 regulators have no eukaryotic orthologs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

For example, the cyclin sub-families (A, B, D, and E) known to regulate the cell cycle in metazoans (for cyclin phylogeny see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) are found across the major branches of eukaryotes. We also found examples of all three sub-families of E2F transcription factors (E2F1-6, DP, E2F7/8) and the pRb family of pocket proteins (for E2F/DP and pRb phylogeny see <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

Taken together, these data indicate that LECA cell cycle regulation was based on multiple cyclin families, as well as regulation by the APC complex and members of the pRb and E2F families. More broadly, our phylogenetic analyses tend to place the fungal regulators as sister groups to the metazoan regulators, as would be expected from the known eukaryotic species tree.

Animals (Metazoa) and yeasts (Fungi) are sister groups (Opisthokonta), and are distantly related to plants (Charophyta), which are members of the Archaeplastida. Check marks indicate the presence of at least one member of a protein family in at least one sequenced species from the corresponding group. We developed profile-HMMs to detect cell division cycle regulators in eukaryotic genomes. For each cell cycle regulatory family (<i>e.g.</i>, Cyclins), we used molecular phylogeny to classify eukaryotic sequences into sub-families (<i>e.g.</i>, Cyclin B, Cyclin A, Cyclin E/D).

Our HMM profile was sensitive enough to discover known, but uncharacterized cyclin sub-families (CycO, CycF, CycG, CycI, CycJ, CycSDS) as <i>bona fide</i> CDC cyclins. A domain threshold of E-20 was used to identify potential CDC cyclin homologs. We first made a phylogeny of all cyclins to classify them. This dataset was then manually pruned to remove long-branches and problematic lineages. Our reduced CDC cyclin dataset (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>) has a total of 499 sequences. Columns with the top 10% Zorro score (496 positions) were used in our alignment. Confidence at nodes was assessed with multiple support metrics using different phylogenetic programs under LG model of evolution (aBayes and SH-aLRT metrics with PhyML, RBS with RAxML, Bayesian Posterior Probability with Phylobayes (23,163 sampled trees, meandiff= 0.01, maxdiff= 0.5)). Colored dots in branches indicate corresponding branch supports. Thick branches indicate significant support by at least two metrics, one parametric and one non-parametric; branch support thresholds are shown in the center of the figure; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods."

We used the E2F_TDP.hmm profile from PFAM to uncover members of the E2F/DP family across eukaryotes. A domain threshold of E-10 was used to identify potential E2F/DP homologs. Our E2F/DP dataset (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>) has 248 sequences. Columns with the top 8% Zorro score (284 positions) were used in our alignment.

Other cell cycle Cdk families in animals (Cdk4/6) and plants (CdkB) are thought to be specific to those lineages.

We were unable to find any eukaryotic homologs of SBF or Whi5 outside of fungi, with a few exceptions related to DNA viruses that we discuss later. SBF is an important member of a larger family of winged helix-turn-helix transcription factors that includes Xbp1, Bqt4, and the APSES family (<span class=\"underline\">A</span>cm1, <span class=\"underline\">P</span>hd1, <span class=\"underline\">S</span>ok2, <span class=\"underline\">E</span>gf1, <span class=\"underline\">S</span>tuA); see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for a complete list of homologs in each fungal genome. The emergence of the new fungal regulators SBF, which includes the large APSES family, and Whi5 is abrupt and occurs near the split of basal fungi from metazoans (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The precise location remains unclear because we have only 1 Nuclearid genome (<i>Fonticula alba</i>) and because Microsporidia are fast-evolving fungal parasites with reduced genomes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Cuomo et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, the new regulators (SBF and Whi5) and ancestral regulators (E2F and Rb) co-exist broadly across basal fungi and the lineages formerly known as 'zygomycetes' (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Zoosporic, basal fungi such as Chytrids (<i>e.g., Spizellomyces punctatus</i>) can have both fungal and animal cell cycle regulators, which likely represents the ancestral fungal hybrid network. SBF-Whi5 in budding yeast plays a similar role to E2F-pRb in animals, which suggests that these pathways were functionally redundant in an ancestral hybrid network. This redundancy would lead to the evolutionary instability of the hybrid network and could explain why different constellations of components are present in the extant zygomycetes and basal fungi (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For example, the zygomycetes have lost pRb while retaining E2F, which was then abruptly lost in the transition to Dikarya. However, with the possible exception of Microsporidia, all fungi have retained SBF and never completely reverted back to the original ancestral state."

To this end, we scrutinized the highly conserved E2F and SBF DNA-binding domains to detect any sequence and structural homology. We used the Pfam HMMER model of the E2F/DP DNA-binding domain and SBF+APSES DNA-binding domain (KilA-N.hmm), which is homologous to the KilA-N domain (<a href=\"#bib53\">Iyer et al., 2002</a>). Our rationale for using KilA-N.hmm from Pfam for remote homology detection of SBF+APSES stems from the fact that it was trained on a diverse set of KilA DNA-binding domains across bacterial DNA viruses, eukaryotic DNA viruses, and fungal SBF+APSES proteins. Thus, it should be a more sensitive HMM model to detect remote KilA-N homologues in other eukaryotic genomes. Our controls (<i>H. sapiens</i> genome, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> genome, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) demonstrate that E2F_TDP.hmm is specific to E2F/DP and that KilA-N.hmm is specific to SBF+APSES. We show that genomes with hybrid network (<i>S. punctatus</i>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, and other basal fungi with both transcription factors, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) have both E2F/DP and SBF+APSES. E2F_TDP.hmm never hits an SBF+APSES transcription factor and KilA-N.hmm never hits an E2F transcription factor (i.e. there are no scores on the diagonal of the panels in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Thus, there is no misclassification by the Pfam HMM models. These data suggest that SBF and other KilA-N domains have no more sequence identity to E2F than non-homologous proteins. We find that non-fungal genomes only hit E2F/DP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) with the notable exception of <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i>, the only non-fungal genome with E2F/DP and KilA-N homologs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>).

The DNA-binding domains of SBF/MBF (<a href=\"#bib82\">Taylor et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Xu et al., 1997</a>) and E2F/DP (<a href=\"#bib92\">Zheng et al., 1999</a>) are structurally classified as members of the winged-helix-turn-helix (wHTH) family, which is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Aravind and Koonin, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Aravind et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Gajiwala and Burley, 2000</a>).

The E2F/DP family has an RRXYD DNA-recognition motif in its helix that is invariant within the E2F/DP family and is responsible for interacting with the conserved, core GCGC motif (<a href=\"#bib92\">Zheng et al., 1999</a>) (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>: red structure). The RRXYD recognition motif is strikingly conserved in E2F/DP across all eukaryotes, including the E2F/DP proteins uncovered in basal fungi (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, left). The first solved SBF/MBF crystal structure, Mbp1 from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> in the absence of DNA, originally\u00a0suggested that\u00a0Mbp1 recognizes its MCB (Mlu I cell cycle box, ACGCGT) binding site via a recognition helix (<a href=\"#bib82\">Taylor et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Xu et al., 1997</a>). However, a recent crystal structure of PCG2, an SBF/MBF homolog in the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, in complex with its MCB binding site does not support this proposed mode of DNA binding (<a href=\"#bib61\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). In striking contrast to many wHTH structures, in which the recognition helix is the mediator of DNA binding specificity, the wing of PCG2 binds to the minor groove to recognize the MCB binding site. The two glutamines in the wing (Q82, Q89) are the key elements that recognize the core MCB binding motif CGCG (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, blue structure). Family-specific conservation in the DNA-binding domain is observed for all members of the SBF family, including basal fungal sequences (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, right). In summary, the incongruences in sequence, structure, and mode of DNA-interaction between E2F/DP and SBF/MBF families strongly suggest that SBF is not derived from E2F."

KilA-N is a member of a core set of 'viral hallmark genes' found across diverse DNA viruses that infect eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib57\">Koonin et al., 2006</a>). Outside the fungal SBF/APSES sub-family, little is known about the KilA-N domain structure, its DNA-binding recognition sequence, and function (<a href=\"#bib17\">Brick et al., 1998</a>).

The three KilA-N domains in <i>R. prolixus</i> have top blast hits to prokaryotic DNA viruses (e.g. Enterobacteria phage P1). The diverse and sparse distribution of KilA-N domains throughout the eukaryotic genomes is consistent with their horizontal gene transfer into hosts from eukaryotic DNA viruses and/or via engulfed bacteria that were infected with prokaryotic DNA viruses. In fact, the horizontal transfer of genes between Mimivirus and their eukaryotic host, or the prokaryotic parasites within the host, has been shown to be a more frequent event that previously thought (<a href=\"#bib66\">Moreira and Brochier-Armanet, 2008</a>)"

There are three major phylogenetic lineages of KilA-N domains: those found in eukaryotic viruses, prokaryotic viruses, and the fungal SBF+APSES family. Our results show that the fungal SBF+APSES family is monophyletic and is strongly supported by multiple phylogenetic support metrics. This suggests a single HGT event as the most likely scenario that established the SBF+APSES family in a fungal ancestor. However, our current phylogeny is unable to distinguish whether the SBF family arrived in a fungal ancestor through a eukaryotic virus or a phage-infected bacterium. Structural and functional characterization of existing viral KilA-N domains could help distinguish between these two hypotheses."

The overlap between the conserved E2F and SBF consensus sites suggests that ancestral SBF could bind E2F regulatory regions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). However, a single base pair substitution in the SBF motif can reduce gene expression by up to ~95% (<a href=\"#bib4\">Andrews and Moore, 1992</a>) and flanking regions outside the core are often important for binding affinity and gene expression (<a href=\"#bib70\">Nutiu et al., 2011</a>). To our knowledge, no one has directly measured the extent to which animal E2F and yeast SBF bind similar sites either in vivo\u00a0or in vitro. To first test whether yeast SBF can bind a canonical E2F binding site, we inserted consensus E2F binding sites in the budding yeast genome. The hijacking hypothesis would be supported in vivo if E2F binding sites could generate SBF-dependent cell cycle regulated gene expression. We used the well-studied <i>CLN2</i> promoter, which has three binding sites for SBF (SCB, Swi4,6-dependent cell cycle box) in a nucleosome-depleted region (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B-C</a>). Removal of these SCB sites is known to eliminate cell cycle-dependent gene expression (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bai et al., 2010</a>). We replaced the complete SBF sites (TCACGAAA) of <i>CLN2</i> (<a href=\"#bib56\">Koch et al., 1996</a>) with a known E2F binding site (GCGCGAAA) from the promoters of the histone gene cluster in mammals (<a href=\"#bib73\">Rabinovich et al., 2008</a>). We observed significant oscillations in GFP expression, which were coordinated with the cell cycle. Importantly, the amplitude of these oscillations was dependent on the budding yeast SBF (Swi4), but not MBF (Mbp1), and disappeared when the 3 binding sites were removed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013D</a>). This experiment demonstrates that budding yeast SBF can bind E2F-like sites, despite the fact that Dikarya lost ancestral E2F hundreds of millions of years ago."

PBM assays measure, in a single experiment, the binding of recombinant proteins to tens of thousands of synthetic DNA sequences, guaranteed to cover all possible 10-bp DNA sequences in a maximally compact representation (each 10-mer occurs once and only once). We used these PBM data to generate DNA motifs for E2F and SBF (<a href=\"#bib15\">Berger et al., 2006</a>), and to compute, for each possible 8-bp DNA sequence, an enrichment score (or E-score) that reflects the specificity of the protein for that 8-mer.

To identify axes of conservation and evolution in eukaryotic cell cycle regulation, we examined a large number of genome sequences in Archaeplastida, Amoebozoa, SAR, Haptophyta, Cryptophyta, Excavata, Metazoa and Fungi. Across eukaryotes, we found a large number of proteins homologous to metazoan rather than fungal G1/S regulators.

Whi5 is a mostly unstructured protein, which, like pRb, recruits transcriptional inhibitor proteins to specific sites on DNA via transcription factor binding (<a href=\"#bib51\">Huang et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib83\">Travesa et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Wang et al., 2009</a>).

We hypothesize that SBF may have hijacked the cell cycle of a fungal ancestor by binding cis-regulatory DNA sites of E2F and activating expression of G1/S genes, thus promoting cell cycle entry. Cell cycle hijacking in a fungal ancestor was followed by evolution of Whi5 to inhibit SBF and Whi5 was subsequently entrained to upstream cell cycle control through phospho-regulation by old or new cyclin-CDKs to create a hybrid network with parallel pathways. The hybrid network likely provided redundant control of the G1/S regulatory network, which could explain the eventual loss of E2F and its replacement by the SBF pathway in more derived fungi (Dikarya). Interestingly, zoosporic fungi such as\u00a0Chytrids have hybrid networks and are transitional species because they exhibit animal-like features of the opisthokont ancestor (centrioles, flagella) and fungal-like features (cell wall, hyphal growth). We hypothesize that E2F and SBF also bind and regulate a subset of animal-specific and fungal-specific G1/S genes, which could help explain the preservation of the hybrid network in Chytrids. Ancestral SBF expanded to create an entire family of transcription factors (APSES) that regulate fungal-specific traits such as sporulation, differentiation, morphogenesis, and virulence."

One answer can be found in the evolution of transcription factors. When the function of an essential transcription factor does change, it often leaves behind a core part of its regulon for another factor (<a href=\"#bib18\">Brown et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Gasch et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Lavoie et al., 2009</a>). This process of handing off transcription factor function has been observed to proceed through an intermediate state, present in some extant genomes, in which both factors perform the function (<a href=\"#bib81\">Tanay et al., 2005</a>). The logic of proceeding through an intermediate state has been well-documented for the regulation of genes expressed only in yeast of mating type <b>a</b> (asgs) (<a href=\"#bib84\">Tsong et al., 2006</a>). In the ancestral yeast and many extant species, asgs expression is activated by a protein only present in <b>a</b> cells, while in other yeasts, expression is repressed by a protein only present in \u03b1 cells and <b>a</b>/\u03b1 diploids. The replacement of the ancestral positive regulation by negative regulation occurred via yeast that contained both systems illustrating how an essential function can evolve through a hybrid state (<a href=\"#bib12\">Baker et al., 2012</a>)."

It appears that the replacement of the E2F-pRb transcription regulatory complex with the SBF-Whi5 complex proceeded via a hybrid intermediate that preserved its function. In the hybrid intermediate, E2F-Rb and SBF-Whi5 may have evolved to be parallel pathways whose functions overlapped to such an extent that the previously essential E2F-Rb pathway could be lost in the transition to Dikarya. Interestingly, many basal fungi (e.g. Chytrids) have preserved rather than lost this hybrid intermediate, which suggests that each pathway may have specialized functions. Chytrids exhibit both animal (e.g. centrioles, flagella, amoeboid movement) and fungal features (e.g. cell wall, hyphal growth) whose synthesis needs to be coordinated with cell division. The preservation of the hybrid network in chytrids could then be explained if animal-like and fungal features are regulated by the E2F-Rb and SBF-Whi5 pathways respectively (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Once Fungi lost many of the ancestral animal-like features during the emergence of the 'zygomycetes' or Dikarya, the ancestral E2F-pRb components could have evolved new functions or have been lost."

While the specific mechanisms may differ, when SBF entered the fungal ancestor cell it might have activated the transcription of E2F target genes. Rather than inhibiting the inhibitor of E2F, SBF may have directly competed for E2F binding sites with transcriptionally inactive E2F-Rb complexes (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Consistent with this model, we have shown here that SBF can directly regulate gene expression in budding yeast via a consensus E2F binding site. Thus, the cooption of a viral protein generated a hybrid network to ultimately facilitate dramatic evolution of the core cell cycle network in fungi."

Profile-HMMs are sensitive tools for remote homology detection. Starting with a set of diverse yet reliable protein homologs is fundamental for detecting remote protein homology and avoiding 'model poisoning' (<a href=\"#bib54\">Johnson et al., 2010</a>). To this end, we used reliable training-set homologs from the cell cycle model organisms <i>Arabidopsis thaliana, Homo sapiens, Schizosaccharomyces pombe,</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, to build the profile-HMMs used to detect homologs. Our profile-HMM search used a stringent E-value threshold of 1E-10 to detect putative homologs in the 'best' filtered protein sets (where available) of our 100+ eukaryotic genomes (see <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a> for genome details). All putative homologs recovered through a profile-HMM search were further validated (or rejected) using an iterative search algorithm (Jackhmmer) against the annotated SwissProt database using the HMMER web server (<a href=\"#bib38\">Finn et al., 2011</a>)."

In the case of basal fungi, which have both E2F/DP and SBF/MBF, all proteins classified as an E2F/DP had clear homology to E2F or DP (see alignment in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and all proteins that we classified as SBF/MBF had clear homology to SBF/MBF (see alignment in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

We then used probabilistic alignment masking using ZORRO (<a href=\"#bib89\">Wu et al., 2012</a>) to create different datasets with varying score thresholds. Next, we used ProtTest 3 to determine the empirical amino-acid evolutionary model that best fit each of our protein datasets using several criteria: Akaike Information Criterion, corrected Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion and Decision Theory (<a href=\"#bib27\">Darriba et al., 2011</a>).

PhyML 3.0 phylogenetic trees were obtained from five independent randomized starting neighbor-joining trees (RAND) using the best topology from both NNI and SPR moves. Non-parametric Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio tests (SH-aLRTs) and parametric <i>\u00e0 la Bayes</i> aLRTs (aBayes) were calculated to determine branch support from two independent PhyML 3.0 runs. For Bayesian inference we used PhyloBayes (rather than the more frequently used MrBayes) because it allows for site-specific amino-acid substitution frequencies, which better models the level of heterogeneity seen in real protein data (<a href=\"#bib59\">Lartillot and Philippe, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Lartillot et al., 2009</a>). We performed Phylobayes analyses by running three independent chains under CAT and the exchange rate provided by ProtTest 3 (e.g. CAT-LG), four discrete gamma categories, and with sampling every 10 cycles. Proper mixing was initially confirmed with Tracer v1.6 (2014). The first 1000 samples were discarded as burn-in, and convergence was assessed using bipartition frequencies and summary statistics provided by bpcomp and tracecomp from Phylobayes. These were visually inspected with an R version of AWTY (<a href=\"https://github.com/danlwarren/RWTY\">https://github.com/danlwarren/RWTY</a>) (<a href=\"#bib71\">Nylander et al., 2008</a>).

All of us feel that the cyclin part was less interesting, more speculative, and poorly motivated. Your story about evolution of SBF-like transcription factors is the more interesting aspect. Unfortunately, the key discovery discussed in the paper, namely the origin of SBF from DNA viruses was reported long ago by Koonin and this aspect of the paper is therefore not entirely novel. More interesting is the finding that basal fungi appear to have both SBF and E2F/Rb like factors, confirming that E2F/Rb must have been replaced by SBF early on in the fungal lineage. In a way, one already knew that this must be case since the E2F system is present in plants as well as animals, implying that it must have been present in the common ancestor of fungi and animals, which are closer to each other than plants. We already knew therefore that E2F must therefore have been lost early in the fungal lineage. However, placing when this took place is certainly interesting and an important advance in our understanding."

Results are also consistent with the obvious alternative hypothesis that SBF and E2Fs are distant homologues and the binding specificity has simply been conserved during evolution. We don't see how any experiment along these lines could be said to support the hijacking hypothesis (to the exclusion of the obvious competing hypothesis). Furthermore, even if SBF and E2F are non-homologous, they have overlapping binding specificity. Since sequence specific transcription factors allow degeneracy (or wobble positions) and bind to short DNA sequence families (motifs), these experiments show only that the E2F sites that were chosen probably overlap the specificity of SBF enough that they can be regulated. Therefore, these experiments really add nothing to the hijacking model, except to confirm the observation that the two transcription factors have overlapping specificity."

Unfortunately, the key discovery discussed in the paper, namely the origin of SBF from DNA viruses was reported long ago by Koonin and this aspect of the paper is therefore not entirely novel. More interesting is the finding that basal fungi appear to have both SBF and E2F/Rb like factors, confirming that E2F/Rb must have been replaced by SBF early on in the fungal lineage. In a way, one already knew that this must be case since the E2F system is present in plants as well as animals, implying that it must have been present in the common ancestor of fungi and animals, which are closer to each other than plants. We already knew therefore that E2F must therefore have been lost early in the fungal lineage.

Many wHTH transcription factors, including the E2F/DP family, have a \u2018recognition helix\u2019 that interacts with the major or minor grooves of the DNA. The E2F/DP family has an RRXYD DNA-recognition motif in its helix that is invariant within the E2F/DP family and is responsible for interacting with the conserved, core GCGC motif (Zheng et al., 1999) (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>: red structure). The RRXYD recognition motif is strikingly conserved in E2F/DP across all eukaryotes, including the E2F/DP proteins uncovered in basal fungi (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, left). In contrast, the first solved SBF/MBF structure, Mbp1 from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> in the absence of DNA, suggested Mbp1 recognizes its MCB (Mlu I cell cycle box, ACGCGT) binding site via a recognition helix (Taylor et al., 1997; Xu et al., 1997). A recent structure of PCG2, an SBF/MBF homolog in the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, in complex with its MCB binding site does not support this proposed mode of DNA binding (Liu et al., 2015). In striking contrast to many wHTH structures, in which the recognition helix is the mediator of DNA binding specificity, the wing of PCG2 binds to the minor groove to recognize the MCB binding site. The two glutamines in the wing (Q82, Q89) are the key elements that recognize the core MCB binding motif CGCG (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, blue structure). Family-specific conservation in the DNA-binding domain is observed for all members of the SBF and APSES family, including basal fungal sequences (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, right). In summary, the incongruences in sequence, structure, and mode of DNA-interaction between E2F/DP and SBF/MBF families strongly suggest that SBF is not derived from E2F.\""

However, they did very little to address my other concerns. Rather than doing a detailed, focused analysis to convince the reader of their hypothesis that the basal fungi contain both transcription factors, and that the SBFs are inherited from a single horizontal transfer event, they simply bolded the basal fungi species names in an alignment. They did not show any phylogenetic analysis that would rule out competing evolutionary scenarios (such as recent transfer of the E2Fs into the basal fungi) or technical issues (such as homology detection problems). In response to my comments about the latter, they simply stated that their HMMs don't make any classification errors: \"Our profile-HMM for E2F/DP family only detects E2F or DP, where as our profile-HMM for SBF/MBF family only detects SBF/MBF (or APSES).\" In fact, I agree with the authors that the HMMs are probably very accurate, but why not show data to support this claim? (E.g., the score distributions or phylogenetic trees?) The authors don't seem to appreciate (or have chosen to ignore) the fact that remote homology detection (especially the claim that homologs are not present) is a statistical process and always has an element of uncertainty. (For example, there might be additional diverged SBF homologues in other eukaryotes that are below the E-value threshold, missed due to gene prediction errors, incomplete genome sequences, etc.) Since the detection of these homologs in the basal fungi and no SBFs in other eukaryotes is the key result of this paper, why not make a convincing case to support it (instead of the unnecessary <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>)?"

In contrast, the KilA-N domain from Pfam was trained on a diverse set of KilA DNA-binding domains across bacterial DNA viruses, eukaryotic DNA viruses, and fungal SBF+APSES proteins. Thus, it should be a more sensitive HMM model to detect remote KilA-N homologues in other eukaryotic genomes.

PBM assays measure, in a single experiment, the binding of recombinant proteins to tens of thousands of synthetic DNA sequences, guaranteed to cover all possible 10-bp DNA sequences in a maximally compact representation (each 10-mer occurs once and only once). We used these PBM data to generate DNA motifs for E2F and SBF (Berger et al., 2006), and to compute, for each possible 8-bp DNA sequence, an enrichment score (or E-score) that reflects the specificity of the protein for that 8-mer. E-scores vary between -0.5 and +0.5, with larger values corresponding to higher affinity binding sites (Berger et al., 2006). As shown in new Figure 10A, E2F1 and Swi4 can bind a set of common motifs.
