Secreted Wnt ligands are involved in many PCP-dependent processes, yet whether they act as polarity cues has been controversial. We show that in <i>Xenopus</i> early ectoderm, the Prickle3/Vangl2 complex was polarized to anterior cell edges and this polarity was disrupted by several Wnt antagonists. In midgastrula embryos, Wnt5a, Wnt11, and Wnt11b, but not Wnt3a, acted across many cell diameters to orient Prickle3/Vangl2 complexes away from their sources regardless of their positions relative to the body axis. The planar polarity of endogenous Vangl2 in the neuroectoderm was similarly redirected by an ectopic Wnt source and disrupted after depletion of Wnt11b in the presumptive posterior region of the embryo. These observations provide evidence for the instructive role of Wnt ligands in vertebrate PCP."

Polarity cues causing the segregation of PCP complexes remain largely unknown (<a href=\"#bib40\">McNeill, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang and Nathans, 2007</a>). Wnt proteins have been proposed as candidates for these cues due to their involvement in many PCP-dependent processes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mahaffey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ossipova et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Qian et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yang and Mlodzik, 2015</a>). However, whether vertebrate Wnt ligands play a permissive or instructive role in PCP remains controversial. While Wnt proteins can instruct PCP in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing and orient myocytes in chick somites (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gros et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Matis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wu et al., 2013</a>), Wnt11 has been argued to act permissively in convergent extension during zebrafish gastrulation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heisenberg et al., 2000</a>)."

When supplied to the ectodermal tissue by RNA microinjection, GFP-Pk3 was homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm and at the cell junctions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). We hypothesized that Pk3 is not polarized because another PCP component is limiting. Given that <i>Drosophila</i> Prickle physically associates with Van Gogh (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bastock et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jenny et al., 2003</a>), we suspected that the limiting factor is a Van Gogh homologue. Indeed, when GFP-Pk3 was coexpressed with Vangl2, its binding partner (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chu et al., 2016</a>), epidermal PCP became evident by the beginning of neurulation with GFP fluorescence enriched at the anterior cell boundary (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In early gastrula ectoderm, GFP-Pk3 was visible as multiple membrane patches (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013D\"</a>) but, at later stages, formed a single Vangl2-positive crescent- or chevron-shaped domain near the anterior cell vertex, i. e. the junction of more than two cells, with a ventral bias (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013H</a>). The anterior localization of GFP-Pk3 was confirmed by the analysis of mosaically-expressing cell clones (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). This distribution might reflect biased stabilization of PCP proteins noted in a recent study (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chien et al., 2015</a>). At the doses used, the exogenous PCP complexes did not cause any visible morphological defects. These findings establish the Pk3/Vangl2 complex as a sensor that allows direct visualization of PCP in <i>Xenopus</i> epidermal ectoderm by the end of gastrulation. This anteroposterior PCP is similar to the one observed in the <i>Xenopus</i> neural plate (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ossipova et al., 2015b</a>) and other vertebrate embryonic tissues (<a href=\"#bib5\">Antic et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Borovina et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ciruna et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Davey et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hashimoto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nishimura et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Roszko et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yin et al., 2008</a>)."

We generated a series of Pk3 deletion mutants and examined their subcellular localization in the presence of Vangl2 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similar to full-length Pk3, the mutated proteins did not polarize in the absence of Vangl2 (data not shown). While the N terminus of Pk3 was dispensable for its polarization, the C-terminal domain was required for Pk3 membrane recruitment, in agreement with its ability to bind Vangl2 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chu et al., 2016</a>). By contrast, Pk3 C-terminus (Pk3-C) was recruited to the plasma membrane but failed to polarize, consistent with the previous study of <i>Drosophila</i> Prickle (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jenny et al., 2003</a>). A Pk3 mutant lacking the LIM domains (Pk3\u0394LIM) was also unable to polarize despite being associated with the cell membrane. Of note, deletion of the CAAX motif, previously implicated in <i>Drosophila</i> Prickle polarization and stability (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lin and Gubb, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Strutt et al., 2013</a>), did not interfere with Pk3 polarization. Removal of the PET domain had a partial effect (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), contrary to the data obtained for Prickle2 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Butler and Wallingford, 2015</a>). These data show that the C-terminus is both necessary and sufficient for Vangl2-dependent membrane recruitment of Pk3, which is a prerequisite for its polarization. Notably, Pk3-C overexpression inhibited the incorporation of MCCs into the superficial epidermal cell layer at tailbud stages (data not shown), confirming the involvement of Pk3 in radial cell intercalation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ossipova et al., 2015a</a>)."

Since several Wnt ligands, including Wnt3a, Wnt5a and Wnt11b, are expressed in <i>Xenopus</i> early embryos (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hikasa and Sokol, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kiecker and Niehrs, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ku and Melton, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Moon et al., 1993</a>), we monitored GFP-Pk3/Vangl2 complex polarization in embryos, in which Wnt signaling was downregulated. Expression of the extracellular domain of Fz8 (ECD8), a potent Wnt inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib30\">Itoh and Sokol, 1999</a>), disrupted Pk3/Vangl2 complex polarization in 85% of injected embryos (n = 41), whereas only 40% of control embryos lacked Pk3/Vangl2 polarity (n = 29) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since ECD8 inhibits the majority of Wnt proteins (<a href=\"#bib30\">Itoh and Sokol, 1999</a>), we utilized more selective Wnt antagonists, DN-Wnt11 and the dominant negative ROR2 receptor Ror2-TM, both of which specifically interfere with Wnt5- and Wnt11-like signals (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hikasa et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Oishi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tada and Smith, 2000</a>). The majority of cells expressing DN-Wnt11 and Ror2-TM lacked GFP-Pk3 polarity in 89% (n= 28) and 88% (n= 25) of injected embryos, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). This loss of polarity was unlikely caused by Pk3 and Vangl2 degradation, judged by immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Wnt3a had little effect on GFP-Pk3 polarity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,E,F</a>).

A slight reorientation of CLIP170-GFP traces was detected towards the border of the Wnt5a clone, yet the difference was insignificant (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, neither live imaging of EB1-GFP nor analysis of stable microtubules visualized by the microtubule-binding protein Ensconsin-GFP revealed a significant effect of Wnt5a on microtubule alignment (data not shown). Thus, Wnt signaling might regulate core PCP proteins without reorganizing microtubules in this system, as opposed to the <i>Drosophila</i> wing (<a href=\"#bib39\">Matis et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, there was no detectable bias in the position of centrosomes marked by \u03b3-tubulin staining (data not shown).

Compared to its anterior polarization in control neuroectodermal cells, Vangl2 was reoriented away from a source of Wnt5a (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>). Such effect was observed in 90% of injected embryos (n = 46), but it was only visible in cells located one to four cell diameters away from the border of the Wnt5a clone. This finding supports our conclusions obtained for ectopic Pk3/Vangl2 complexes and suggests that the anterior polarization of Vangl2 results from endogenous Wnt proteins secreted from the posterior end of the embryo. To elucidate which Wnt ligands might be responsible, we knocked down Wnt5a and Wnt11b, two non-canonical Wnt ligands expressed at the posterior region of gastrula embryos (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ku and Melton, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Moon et al., 1993</a>), using previously characterized morpholino oligonucleotides (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pandur et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Schambony and Wedlich, 2007</a>). Whereas Vangl2 was accumulated at the anterior borders of cells in control embryos (87%, n = 24) and Wnt5a-depleted embryos (90%, n = 28), this polarity was retained only in 59% of embryos depleted of Wnt11b (n = 32) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a> and data not shown). These observations suggest the involvement of Wnt11b in anteroposterior PCP, consistent with its proposed activity in the gastrocoel roof plate (<a href=\"#bib61\">Walentek et al., 2013</a>). Taken together, our gain- and loss-of-function assays support the idea that Wnt11b acts from the posterior region to establish an\u00a0anteroposterior PCP across many cell diameters. Nevertheless, since the morpholino injection into vegetal blastomeres might partially interfere with the local production of Wnt11b in the neural plate, currently we cannot discriminate between long-range diffusion and local effects of Wnt proteins propagated by a signal relay system or cell division (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alexandre et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Farin et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Zecca et al., 1996</a>)."

The latter explanation is less likely, because ECD8, expected to compete with Frizzled for Vangl2 binding, interfered with Pk3 polarization, instead of instructing it similar to Wnt5a (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Alternatively, given the role of Wnt signaling in gastrulation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Habas et al., 2001</a>), Wnt proteins might generate mechanical strains to modulate PCP (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aigouy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chien et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Heisenberg and Bellaiche, 2013</a>). While the effect of mechanical forces on PCP is thought to require microtubule reorganization (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chien et al., 2015</a>), we did not detect a significant change of microtubule orientation in response to Wnt5a. Although our results demonstrate that Wnt proteins can instruct Pk3 polarization in our specific experimental conditions, the immediate morphological manifestations of this activity remain obscure and whether such function involves mechanical or chemical signaling should be established by future studies."

By contrast, ubiquitously expressed Wnt11 can partially rescue zebrafish embryos with a mutation in the <i>wnt11</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heisenberg et al., 2000</a>). Whereas this finding suggests a permissive effect, lack of complete rescue may be also explained by the absence of proper instructions. At present, it is still unclear whether the proposed instructive mechanism operates to direct PCP during normal embryonic development."

Since Pk3 forms patches rather than crescents in stage 11.5 embryos, cell polarity was quantified differently. In this case, cell orientation was defined as an angle between the line approximating each Pk3 patch and the line tangential to TFP clone border and was measured by ImageJ. Data were collected from GFP-Pk3-expressing cells within 10 cell diameters from the TFP clone border. Rose diagrams were drawn using Oriana 3 (Kovach Computing Services, UK), and two-sample Chi-squared test was used for statistical analysis.

Core components of the pathway include Fzd and Dsh family members, however the requirement for a Wnt ligand in planar polarization is variable: essential for some PCP processes and apparently dispensable for others. Even in contexts where a Wnt is essential, the loss of function experiments that demonstrate this do not distinguish between a permissive versus an instructive role in specifying the direction of polarization. This brief manuscript demonstrates that the polarization of PCP components occurs in response to a Wnt ligand. Using the robust Vangl2-dependent localization of Pk3 to anterior cell boundaries in the <i>Xenopus</i> non-neural ectoderm as a direct readout of PCP signaling in dominant-negative and gain-of-function experiments, they show a) that planar polarization depends on Wnt signaling and b) that localized expression of a Wnt ligand can repolarize epithelial cells several cell diameters away from the source. This is not the only mechanism by which PCP can be established; in other contexts, PCP can arise in response to tension, flow, or by unknown but Wnt-independent means. Nevertheless, the paper shows clearly that a directional Wnt signal can establish PCP and as such is an important addition to the literature. With the relatively minor revisions suggested below I feel that the paper is appropriate for publication in <i>eLife</i>."

The authors use coexpression of Pk3-GFP and Vangl2 as markers of GFP, and dominant negative Wnt and FzECD constructs to indicate a requirement for Wnt's, and Wnt ectopic expression to demonstrate the ability to determine directionality. The notion that Wnt's act as long range directional signals for PCP has been unsettled in all systems in which it has been addressed for as long as the idea has been floated. The evidence presented here that this is the case in the gastrula stage ectoderm is as good as any in any system so far, which is to say intriguing, but not entirely compelling. It has been clear for some time that Wnts <i>can</i> direct polarity. The key question is whether they <i>do</i> direct polarity, and it is here that this study, like several previous ones, falls just short of being entirely convincing. I'm on the fence about whether the arguments presented here warrant publication in a leading journal, but at a minimum there are several things that should be done to shore up the argument."

Why Vangl2 should be limiting for Pk3 localization at these stages is an interesting and more puzzling question in light of recently published results. The failure to observe asymmetry of exogenous Pk3-GFP if endogenous Pk3 is asymmetrically localized is best explained if the Pk3-GFP is present in large excess, so that asymmetry that would otherwise be evident is swamped out by randomly localized and unassociated Pk3. The less interesting possibility is that endogenous Pk3 is not localized asymmetrically, but can be induced to do so in the presence of the necessary other players."

The puzzle here is the contrasting dynamics. Butler's results suggest a much later acquisition of polarity, as their probes were symmetric as late as stage 19, and only subsequently showed increasing asymmetry by the time of MCC differentiation. From these results, we would infer that there is little or no activity of the PCP components at the gastrula stage."

For example, we have no evidence that Pk3 is needed for this polarity, and there is no independent readout of polarization. In the GRP, Pk3 is normally at the basal bodies, though it can be induced to apicolateral asymmetry, and its role and localization in radial intercalation of MCCs (Sokol lab) are both potentially consistent with different mechanisms. Given these observations, it is plausible that the authors have created a synthetic PCP system that can respond to Wnt's, but that doesn't normally exist. The authors offer no other readout for PCP at this time."

(although these assays also required the co-expression of exogenous components), and this was associated with polarized apical microtubules. However, these authors concluded that tissue strain provided the directionality to polarization, in contrast to the current contention that Wnt signaling directs polarization. If Chien et al. are correct, it may be that microtubules determine the direction of the PCP orientation, as opposed to being responsive to PCP protein polarization. Furthermore, these authors showed that microtubule orientation is responsive to strain, which might be providing the directional signal. If the authors suggest that microtubules are reading Wnt dependent polarity, it would stretch the imagination to conceive that strain reorganizes the pattern of Wnt expression. A more harmonious conclusion would be that if Wnt's are involved, they are involved in local cell to cell signaling rather than long range signaling."

This, combined with the gain-of-function data showing that Wnt expressing cells can repolarize Vangl2 and Pk3 over several cell diameters, is compelling evidence for a role for Wnts in orienting PCP in the frog gastrula non-neural ectoderm. On the other hand, the authors tried but failed to detect polarization of any sub-cellular structure apart from PCP core components themselves. They argue that microtubule or centrosomal asymmetry may be a much later consequence of PCP, not detectable at these early stages. They have also addressed some relatively minor comments I had about quantification of the data. In sum, the paper is improved by demonstrating a requirement for Wnts in endogenous Vangl2 localization, but remains focused on the polarity proteins themselves and not their morphological or cellular consequences. As I was already quite positive about the paper, which I found to be the clearest demonstration to date of a role for Wnts in directing epithelial PCP, I feel that it is now appropriate for publication in <i>eLife</i>."

Using the robust Vangl2-dependent localization of Pk3 to anterior cell boundaries in the Xenopus non-neural ectoderm as a direct readout of PCP signaling in dominant-negative and gain-of-function experiments, they show a) that planar polarization depends on Wnt signaling and b) that localized expression of a Wnt ligand can repolarize epithelial cells several cell diameters away from the source. This is not the only mechanism by which PCP can be established; in other contexts, PCP can arise in response to tension, flow, or by unknown but Wnt-independent means. Nevertheless, the paper shows clearly that a directional Wnt signal can establish PCP and as such is an important addition to the literature. With the relatively minor revisions suggested below I feel that the paper is appropriate for publication in eLife.</i> "

The evidence presented here that this is the case in the gastrula stage ectoderm is as good as any in any system so far, which is to say intriguing, but not entirely compelling. It has been clear for some time that Wnts can direct polarity. The key question is whether they do direct polarity, and it is here that this study, like several previous ones, falls just short of being entirely convincing.

The failure to observe asymmetry of exogenous Pk3-GFP if endogenous Pk3 is asymmetrically localized is best explained if the Pk3-GFP is present in large excess, so that asymmetry that would otherwise be evident is swamped out by randomly localized and unassociated Pk3.

For example, we have no evidence that Pk3 is needed for this polarity, and there is no independent readout of polarization. In the GRP, Pk3 is normally at the basal bodies, though it can be induced to apicolateral asymmetry, and its role and localization in radial intercalation of MCCs (Sokol lab) are both potentially consistent with different mechanisms.

In response to the criticism that their gain-of-function experiments show that Wnt signaling CAN direct planar polarity but not that it DOES direct endogenous polarity, they include new data showing that the polarization of endogenous Vangl2 is altered by localized WNT overexpression, and that morpholino knockdown of Wnt11b eliminates endogenous Vangl2 polarization. This, combined with the gain-of-function data showing that Wnt expressing cells can repolarize Vangl2 and Pk3 over several cell diameters, is compelling evidence for a role for Wnts in orienting PCP in the frog gastrula non-neural ectoderm. On the other hand, the authors tried but failed to detect polarization of any sub-cellular structure apart from PCP core components themselves. They argue that microtubule or centrosomal asymmetry may be a much later consequence of PCP, not detectable at these early stages. They have also addressed some relatively minor comments I had about quantification of the data. In sum, the paper is improved by demonstrating a requirement for Wnts in endogenous Vangl2 localization, but remains focused on the polarity proteins themselves and not their morphological or cellular consequences. As I was already quite positive about the paper, which I found to be the clearest demonstration to date of a role for Wnts in directing epithelial PCP, I feel that it is now appropriate for publication in eLife.</i> "
