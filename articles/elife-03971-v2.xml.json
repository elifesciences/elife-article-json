This can be achieved by the phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of a key translation initiation factor, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). However, the persistent translation of certain mRNAs is required for deployment of an adequate stress response. We carried out ribosome profiling of cultured human cells under conditions of severe stress induced with sodium arsenite. Although this led to a 5.4-fold general translational repression, the protein coding open reading frames (ORFs) of certain individual mRNAs exhibited resistance to the inhibition. Nearly all resistant transcripts possess at least one efficiently translated upstream open reading frame (uORF) that represses translation of the main coding ORF under normal conditions. Site-specific mutagenesis of two identified stress resistant mRNAs (PPP1R15B and IFRD1) demonstrated that a single uORF is sufficient for eIF2-mediated translation control in both cases. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that at least two regulatory uORFs (namely, in SLC35A4 and MIEF1) encode functional protein products."

This can be achieved by the phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of a key translation initiation factor, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). However, the persistent translation of certain mRNAs is required for deployment of an adequate stress response. We carried out ribosome profiling of cultured human cells under conditions of severe stress induced with sodium arsenite. Although this led to a 5.4-fold general translational repression, the protein coding open reading frames (ORFs) of certain individual mRNAs exhibited resistance to the inhibition. Nearly all resistant transcripts possess at least one efficiently translated upstream open reading frame (uORF) that represses translation of the main coding ORF under normal conditions. Site-specific mutagenesis of two identified stress resistant mRNAs (PPP1R15B and IFRD1) demonstrated that a single uORF is sufficient for eIF2-mediated translation control in both cases. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that at least two regulatory uORFs (namely, in SLC35A4 and MIEF1) encode functional protein products."

If a cell is stressed, such as by being exposed to harmful chemicals, it makes fewer proteins in order to conserve its resources. This down-regulation of protein production is achieved in part by the cell chemically modifying its eIF2 proteins to make them less able to initiate translation. However, stressed cells still continue to make more of certain proteins that help them to combat stress. The mRNA molecules for some of these proteins contain at least one other start codon in the 5\u2032 untranslated region. The sequence that would be translated from such a start codon is known as an upstream open reading frame (or uORF for short)\u2014and this feature is thought to help certain proteins to still be expressed despite low levels of active eIF2. Andreev, O'Connor et al. have now analysed which mRNAs are translated in human cells that have been treated with a chemical that induces stress and makes the eIF2 protein less able to initiate translation. To do so, a technique called ribosome profiling was used to identify all of the mRNA molecules bound to ribosomes shortly after treatment with this chemical."

However, Andreev, O'Connor et al. observed that the translation of a few mRNAs continued almost as normal, or even increased, after the chemical treatment. Notably, most of these mRNAs encoded regulatory proteins, which are not required in large amounts. With one exception, all of these resistant mRNAs contained uORFs. In unstressed cells, these uORFs were efficiently translated, while the same mRNA's coding sequences were translated less efficiently. Andreev, O'Connor et al. suggest that these two features could be used to identify mRNAs that are still translated into working proteins when cells are stressed. Further work is now needed to explore the mechanisms by which translation of these uORFs allows mRNAs to resist the stress."

During various stress conditions the cell triggers the integrated stress response (ISR) by activating any of four kinases, EIF2AK1 (also known as [a.k.a.] HRI), EIF2AK2 (a.k.a. PKR), EIF2AK3 (a.k.a. PERK), or EIF2AK4 (a.k.a. GCN2), that phosphorylate the alpha subunit of eIF2 at Ser51 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Baird and Wek, 2012</a>). Instead of a rapid recycling, eIF2B forms a stable complex with phosphorylated eIF2. The concentration of eIF2 is higher than that of eIF2B, therefore even phosphorylation of a modest number of eIF2 molecules rapidly reduces the pool of active eIF2B resulting in the general inhibition of total protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hinnebusch, 2014</a>)."

This requires at least two upstream open reading frames (uORFs). In ATF4 mRNA, after translation termination at the first uORF, the 40S resumes scanning albeit without the TC. The distance scanned by this ribosome subunit before it reacquires the TC depends on TC availability. Under normal conditions most of the 40S is quickly reloaded with TC and therefore can reinitiate at the second uORF. Under stress conditions (i.e., low eIF2 availability), a larger fraction of 40S subunits scan past the second uORF initiation codon before binding of the TC, thereby enabling reinitiation at the next ORF."

For this purpose, we chose to treat cells with sodium arsenite for a short time period and to monitor the immediate translational response. Sodium arsenite is a well-known potent inducer of eIF2 phosphorylation that activates EIF2AK1 (<a href=\"#bib42\">McEwen et al., 2005</a>). We examined changes in the phosphorylation status of eIF2 and EIF4EBP1 during arsenite treatment to identify suitable conditions for ribosome profiling. The phosphorylated form of eIF2 (p-eIF2) progressively accumulates during the first 2 hr of stress (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). After 0.5 hr of arsenite treatment, p-eIF2 reaches 30\u201340% of maximal levels of phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The dephosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 becomes evident 1 hr after treatment and does not revert (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We did not detect changes in phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and its substrate RPS6 during arsenite treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). A robust accumulation of ATF4 is evident 30 min after treatment. These results suggest that 0.5 hr post-treatment is likely to be suitable for examining eIF2 inhibition whilst minimizing possible arsenite-induced side effects. Furthermore, the number of ribosomes in polysome fractions was reduced by \u223c4.5-fold under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

However, it is conceivable that the arsenite treatment could affect the stability of specific mRNAs. Indeed, the treatment was found to significantly alter the transcript levels of 24 genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The most pronounced effect observed is the accumulation of JUN mRNA, a transcript that is short-lived under normal conditions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Elkon et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rabani et al., 2011</a>). <i>JUN</i> encodes a subunit of the AP-1 transcription factor implicated in response to a myriad of physiological and pathological stimuli (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib22\">Hess et al., 2004</a>). AP-1 transcription factors consist of homo- or heterodimers of different subunits and its composition is crucial for its specificity. As displayed in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, despite a significant decrease in its translational efficiency, the overall expression of JUN is almost unaffected upon arsenite treatment because of the increase in its mRNA levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). According to previous observations, AP-1 may induce apoptosis upon treatment with arsenite (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Namgung and Xia, 2000</a>)."

Indeed, with the exception of a single weakly expressed gene <i>HOXB2</i>, all mRNAs found to be resistant (TE Z-score &gt;4) contained uORF(s) that are translated under normal conditions. However, ribosome profiling data suggest that 8% of other expressed mRNAs also have translated uORFs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Hence, the mere presence of translated uORFs is a poor predictor of resistance. We therefore investigated further the features of uORFs that are associated with stress resistance. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, uORFs in the resistant mRNAs are usually efficiently translated under normal conditions, though yet again there is a large absolute number of non-resistant mRNAs that contain similarly efficiently translated uORFs. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> shows the relationship between the TE of the CDS and the resistance: the CDS of the most resistant mRNAs is weakly translated under normal conditions. The ratio of the ribosome densities in uORFs and in CDS provides a much better criterion for discriminating between resistant and non-resistant mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The length of all the translated uORFs (in the resistant mRNAs) was found to exceed 20 codons, although this is of limited predictive value as there are many long uORFs in non-resistant mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Based on these findings we expected that, upon arsenite treatment, the ribosome density for resistant mRNAs would shift from the 5\u2032 leaders to CDS. Such a shift is indeed observable (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>)."

This was true for <i>IFRD1</i> (a.k.a. <i>PC4</i> and <i>TIS7</i>), an interferon-related developmental regulator that was reported to be a modifier gene for cystic fibrosis (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gu et al., 2009</a>). It has been reported previously that one of the two <i>IFRD1</i> transcript variants possesses a 51 codon uORF which triggers mRNA decay upon termination under normal conditions but not under conditions of Unfolded Protein Response mediated by tunicamycin (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zhao et al., 2010</a>). We did not observe a significant change in the transcript level upon arsenite treatment. A second case is <i>UCP2</i>, which codes for a mitochondrial anion carrier protein that increases the proton conductance of the mitochondrial membrane in response to reactive oxygen species production (<a href=\"#bib9\">Baird and Wek, 2012</a>). It was shown that expression of <i>UCP2</i> is upregulated at the translational level upon oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adam et al., 2006</a>). The <i>UCP2</i> 5\u2032 leader contains a 36 codon uORF that inhibits translation of <i>UCP2</i> mRNA under normal conditions (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hurtaud et al., 2006</a>)."

Its 5\u2032 leader contains 11 AUG codons, most of which are not conserved; however, one AUG that initiates a 102 codon uORF is highly conserved across vertebrates. This uORF encodes a peptide sequence containing PFAM domain DUF4535, ID PF15054; moreover, the pattern of its conservation is consistent with protein coding evolution (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that this uORF likely encodes a functional protein. This alternative protein (EMBL accession HF548106) was recently detected by mass spectrometry analysis of cultured cells and human tissues (<a href=\"#bib65\">Vanderperre et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2014</a>).

AZIN1</i> encodes an inhibitor of ODC1 (ornithine decarboxylase) antizymes.

This makes it a competitive inhibitor of antizymes (<a href=\"#bib48\">Murakami et al., 1988</a>).

To directly address the impact of eIF2 phosphorylation on reporter mRNA translation during arsenite stress, we carried out an experiment where cells were pre-transfected with a plasmid encoding the full length human PPP1R15A (a.k.a. GADD34) phosphatase subunit which is able to reverse eIF2 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brush et al., 2003</a>). Arsenite-induced eIF2 phosphorylation, as expected, was almost completely alleviated in the presence of GADD34 (residual phosphorylation probably reflects less than 100% efficient plasmid transfection), see <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>. As a result, the downregulation of control Rluc mRNA was only twofold in comparison with a more than sixfold reduction in cells not transfected with the GADD34 plasmid. Translation of the IFRD1 reporter was not affected under either condition. We therefore concluded that translational inhibition caused by arsenite treatment is predominantly due to the phosphorylation of eIF2. Also, we treated cells with 2.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), triggers the Unfolded Protein Response and results in eIF2 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Prostko et al., 1993</a>).

We hypothesized that some features of the 5\u2032 leaders upstream of uORFs may be important for resistance. To address this issue we created two additional reporters based on control pGL3 and IFRD1, where we added a 5\u2032 terminal stem loop of intermediate stability (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). As expected, the addition of this stem loop resulted in a threefold to fourfold decrease in the activity of both reporters under normal conditions. Interestingly, when arsenite stress was induced, the SL-IFRD1 construct did not exhibit resistance while translation of SL-PGL3 was downregulated as much as the pGL3 construct. Therefore we propose that efficient loading of pre-initiator complexes to the uORF is necessary for stress resistance in IFRD1. Next we addressed the question of whether the specific sequence upstream of the IFRD1 uORF is required for regulation. We substituted it with an artificial single stranded (CAA)<sub>6</sub> sequence of the same length. This mutation did not alter stress resistance. Thus, we hypothesize that, for resistant translation, the uORF has to be preceded with a leader allowing a high initiation rate at the uORF."

Translation of six mRNAs (encoding ATF4, PPP1R15A, SLC35A4, C19orf48, ATF5, HOXB2) was increased and translation of four (encoding IFRD1, PTP4A1, PCNXL4, UCP2) was reduced only slightly in comparison with a global reduction in translation.

It is unclear, however, whether these features are common due to the resistance-providing mechanism or due to their function. mRNAs resistant to eIF2 are expected to encode components of cell signalling (e.g. transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases) and therefore are not required in large quantities. We also found that, with one exception, all mRNAs significantly resistant to the stress conditions possess translated uORFs in their 5\u2032 leaders. Their number, mutual organization, and depth of phylogenetic conservation vary. <i>IFRD1</i> has only a single uAUG in its 5\u2032 leader while <i>SLC35A4</i> has 11 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). For these mRNAs at least one of the uORFs is efficiently translated under normal conditions and is longer than 20 codons. We confirmed that 5\u2032 leaders of some of these mRNAs confer translation resistance to a reporter in synthetic RNA constructs. Owing to the diversity of the uORF organisation in these 5\u2032 leaders, the mechanism of uORF-mediated resistance may vary and should be studied individually. We chose to explore how the sequence properties of <i>IFRD1</i> and <i>PPP1R15B</i> 5\u2032 leaders affect the resistance of downstream ORFs. For this purpose we carried out site-directed mutagenesis of 5\u2032 leader sequences in the constructs containing a luciferase reporter. We found that translation of only one uORF is sufficient to provide resistance to eIF2 inhibition for <i>IFRD1</i> and <i>PPP1R15B</i>. Therefore it is likely that the resistance for these transcripts is provided by the mechanism that resembles alleviation of scanning ribosomes obstruction rather than delayed reinitiation (ATF4-like cases). The substitution of IFRD1 leader upstream of an uORF with an artificial single stranded sequence does not affect stress resistance, ruling out the requirement for a specific nucleotide sequence. However it is likely to enable rapid ribosome loading at the uORF since the addition of a 5\u2032 terminal stem loop of intermediate stability abolished stress resistance. This observation may explain why translation of many mammalian mRNAs possessing uORFs is not resistant to eIF2 phosphorylation. Translation of these uORFs might be inhibited to such an extent that they would be unable to provide any resistance."

HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with alanyl-glutamine and 10% FBS and replated to 150 mm dishes (two dishes per sample). After the cells reached 70\u201380% confluency, sodium arsenite (or vehicle) was added at 40 \u00b5M and 30 min later the cells were harvested: dishes were immediately chilled on ice and washed with PBS + cycloheximide (100 \u00b5g/ml). Importantly, cells were not pre-treated with cycloheximide to avoid artificial accumulation of initiation complexes at translation initiation starts (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gerashchenko and Gladyshev, 2015</a>). Cells were then lysed with buffer containing 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 \u00b5g/ml cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 U/ml TURBO DNAse (Ambion, Waltham, MA). Note that the buffer contains low magnesium (1.5 mM), since high magnesium concentrations stabilize secondary structures in mRNAs which may hamper digestion by RNAse I (RNAse I itself does not require divalent cations for its activity) and lowering magnesium concentration in 5 mM to 15 mM range has been shown to improve footprint resolution (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ingolia et al., 2012</a>). Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min, centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7<i>g</i> at +4\u00b0C for 10 min, and the supernatant was divided into two parts for ribo-seq and \u2018naked\u2019 mRNA-seq library preparation. One part of the lysate, usually 10\u201320 A260, was treated with RNAse I (Ambion) with 100 U per 3.1 A260 of lysate at 23\u00b0C for 50 min. The digestion was then stopped with the appropriate amount of SUPERASE inhibitor (Ambion). The treated lysate was loaded on 10\u201360% (m/v) sucrose density gradient containing 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 100 \u03bcg/ml cycloheximide and centrifuged in SW-41 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 3 hr. Sucrose density gradients were prepared as described previously (<a href=\"#bib60\">Stone, 1974</a>). Briefly, 5.5 ml of 10% sucrose was slowly layered onto the same volume of 60% sucrose, gradient tubes were then sealed with parafilm, slowly placed horizontally for 4 hr to allow spontaneous gradient formation and then slowly returned to a vertical position. This method of gradient formation is highly reliable and reproducible and does not require any special equipment. Total RNA from the fractions corresponding to 80S peak was then extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation."

For the analysis of differential translation efficiency the minimum value (referred to as the minimum expression level) was taken from four conditions while, for the analysis of differential RNA level, only RNA-seq reads obtained under control and stress conditions were used. With the minimum expression level threshold of two reads, transcripts were sorted in ascending order and arranged in bins of size 300. Each bin had transcripts with a similar number of mapped reads and was analysed independently. The mean and standard deviation of change in expression of the transcripts within each bin was used to determine a Z-score for each transcript. For the remaining transcripts of insufficient number to be binned (&lt;300), the mean and standard deviation was obtained from the previous bin. The Z-score determined for each transcript enabled comparison between bins."

An uORF was defined as a sequence of sense codons uninterrupted with a stop codon and beginning with an AUG codon located upstream of the annotated CDS. In the case of uORFs overlapping CDS, the 5\u2032 end of CDS was considered as the end of the uORF in order to avoid ambiguity in assigning ribo-seq reads to one of the two overlapping ORFs. Nested uORFs (those contained within uORFs in the same frame) were excluded for the same reason. The TE of an uORF was estimated as the average density of ribo-seq reads in the uORF divided by the average density of the mRNA-seq reads for the corresponding mRNA. An uORF was considered to be translated if more than five ribo-seq reads aligned to it. For transcripts with more than one translated uORF, the properties of the uORF with the highest number of aligned ribo-seq reads were used."

This value was determined for genes under arsenite and control conditions.

Curiously in this manuscript, arsenite stress did not induce the expression of the luciferase reporter with the 5'-leader of the ATF4 transcript (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and there was perhaps only a modest enhancement of ribosome occupancy in the mRNA CDS during arsenite stress as judged by ribosome profiling. Perhaps arsenite differs from other stress conditions that were reported to induce preferential translation of ATF4 mRNA (e.g. pharmacological inducers of ER stress)."

The GAPDH loading control is overexposed and, therefore, inadequate. The phosphorylation of eIF2alpha is up at 0.5 hours but maximal at 2 hours. The concern is the possible crossover of 4E\u2013BP1 activation (loss of phosphorylation) and the onset of eIF2alpha phosphorylation. The authors should more rigorously exclude indirect targeting of mTORC1\u20134EBP and mTORC1\u2013S6K pathways of protein synthesis regulation by arsenite treatment. The 4EBP1 blot on <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> should be less exposed to make the bands more discernible. The blots showing no change in p-4EBP1 and p-S6K levels under their conditions of arsenite treatment should also be shown. Do the authors have an independent control for determining the level of cap-dependent translation vs. the level of eIF2-dependent translation?"

The reporter assays do not fully support the profiling data, and the controls, e.g. ATF4, did not follow the expected induced translation with increased eIF2 phosphorylation. In the rebuttal letter (the Methods of the manuscript were not detailed on this point), the reporter mRNA was stated to be transfected in cultured cells for 1 hour prior to arsenite treatment for an additional 2 hours (the Methods section stated the later treatment time). There is a concern that the non-stressed cells are not truly non-stressed as there is likely to be insufficient recovery from the transfection using lipofectamin 2000. This could explain why there were virtually no genes that were preferentially translated in the reporter assay, just different degrees of repression. The non-stressed conditions were not without the underlying membrane stress of the transfection agent. Also 40 micromolar is a large amount of arsenite to stress the cells."

This is the heart of the manuscript. In Reviewer concern 1, the response stated that qPCR and polysome analysis would not be appropriate for this analysis despite its utility in the literature. As a consequence, the manuscript elected to rely on reporter assays involving transfections of mRNAs featuring 5'-leaders of targeted gene transcripts upstream of the firefly luciferase coding sequence. ATF4, a well-characterized preferentially translated gene transcript was used as a positive control, and the artificial gene transcript pGL3 was an example of a gene that is repressed by eIF2 phosphorylation and stress. Curiously, ATF4 translation was not preferentially translated, but displayed a partial resistance to arsenite stress. The authors\u2019 argument for why ATF4 ribosome profiling data and reporter data are in agreement (even though the ATF4 reporter is not induced) is based on \u201ctechnical limits of methods accuracy\u201d. The details of the reporter assay were not fully clear in the original or present manuscript, but the response letter provided additional details in the response to reviewer concern number 3. The mRNAs were transfected into HEK293T cells and 1 hour after transfection the cells were treated with arsenite for 2 hours prior to harvesting and analysis. There are some concerns about the timing in this protocol, such as would 1 hour be sufficient time for the resolution of the membrane stress triggered by the transfection protocol? Furthermore, it is suggested that even though the <i>SLC35A4</i> reporter was not inducible during arsenite stress, that this is not in disagreement with the ribosome profiling dataset because <i>SLC35A4</i> mRNA levels are low in the profiling dataset. As the purpose of using the Z-score was to eliminate variability and error in the assessment of the ribosome profiling dataset, is this sufficient justification for why the two assay results do not appear to be consistent? In a related point in concern number 6, it was suggested that the manuscript should focus on \u201cestablishing cause/effect between eIF2 phosphorylation and translation expression of a gene.\u201d This could be directly addressed in the reporter assay, and the explanation involving an alternative stress (DTT) and mTOR did not appear to adequately address this basic concern."

This is the heart of the manuscript. In Reviewer concern 1, the response stated that qPCR and polysome analysis would not be appropriate for this analysis despite its utility in the literature. As a consequence, the manuscript elected to rely on reporter assays involving transfections of mRNAs featuring 5'-leaders of targeted gene transcripts upstream of the firefly luciferase coding sequence. ATF4, a well-characterized preferentially translated gene transcript was used as a positive control, and the artificial gene transcript pGL3 was an example of a gene that is repressed by eIF2 phosphorylation and stress. Curiously, ATF4 translation was not preferentially translated, but displayed a partial resistance to arsenite stress. The authors\u2019 argument for why ATF4 ribosome profiling data and reporter data are in agreement (even though the ATF4 reporter is not induced) is based on \u201ctechnical limits of methods accuracy\u201d. The details of the reporter assay were not fully clear in the original or present manuscript, but the response letter provided additional details in the response to reviewer concern number 3. The mRNAs were transfected into HEK293T cells and 1 hour after transfection the cells were treated with arsenite for 2 hours prior to harvesting and analysis. There are some concerns about the timing in this protocol, such as would 1 hour be sufficient time for the resolution of the membrane stress triggered by the transfection protocol? Furthermore, it is suggested that even though the SLC35A4 reporter was not inducible during arsenite stress, that this is not in disagreement with the ribosome profiling dataset because SLC35A4 mRNA levels are low in the profiling dataset. As the purpose of using the Z-score was to eliminate variability and error in the assessment of the ribosome profiling dataset, is this sufficient justification for why the two assay results do not appear to be consistent? In a related point in concern number 6, it was suggested that the manuscript should focus on \u201cestablishing cause/effect between eIF2 phosphorylation and translation expression of a gene.\u201d This could be directly addressed in the reporter assay, and the explanation involving an alternative stress (DTT) and mTOR did not appear to adequately address this basic concern</i>."

Upon arsenite treatment, control Rluc mRNA translation was downregulated 2 fold. Compare this with more than 6 fold when GADD34 was overexpressed. Translation of <i>IFRD1</i> reporter was not affected at all. From this experiment, we can conclude that inhibitory effect of arsenite is mostly accounted for by eIF2 phosphorylation.

Ribosome profiling provides a snapshot of translation after 0.5 hours of stress. The reporter assay relies on the amount of luciferase produced during 2 hours post transfection. In other words, if we think of translation as a function, ribosome profiling provides a signal at single time point, while the reporter assay corresponds to the integral of the signal after a long time period. Hence the only scenario when both approaches are expected to fully converge would be when upon very rapid phosphorylation of eIF2 its levels would not change over time. It is not the case with arsenite treatment when continuous increase of eIF2 phosphorylation is evident. Second, reporter assays do not depend on natural gene expression levels, while ribosome profiling does. Because of that discordance is particularly likely for low expressed genes. As noted by the referee, <i>SLC35A4</i> is a good example of this. The change fold observed in ribosome profiling data was high enough to surpass the threshold for statistical significance (Z&gt;4), yet the absolute level is unreliable due to high signal variability for such a lowly expressed gene. Subsequently reporter assays confirmed <i>SLC35A4</i> as the most resistant (even induced) mRNA, but did not confirm the absolute levels."

Indeed, we observed increases in absolute levels of ATF4 reporter when a lower concentration of arsenite was used.

We observed earlier that all stress resistant mRNAs possess efficiently translated uORFs. So, we hypothesized that some features of 5\u2019 leaders upstream of uORFs may be important for the regulation. We decided to address this issue with reporter constructs. To this end, we created two additional reporters based on control pGL3 and <i>IFRD1</i>, where we added 5\u2019 terminal stem loop of intermediate stability. As expected, addition of this stem loop resulted in a 3-4 fold decrease of both reporters yield under normal conditions. Interestingly, when arsenite stress was induced, SL+<i>IFRD1</i> (<i>IFRD1</i> with stem loop) construct was no longer resistant, while translation of SL+pGL3 and pGL3 constructs was similarly reduced. From this, we can propose that high loading of preinitiator complexes to uORF is necessary for stress resistance. Next, we addressed the question of whether the specific sequence upstream of <i>IFRD1</i> uORF is required for the regulation. To this end, we substituted it with an artificial single stranded (CAA)6 leader of the same length. This modification did not affect stress resistance. Thus, we hypothesize that for resistant translation, the uORF have to be situated under the control of a leader that allows high initiation rates at uORF. These experiments are now described in a new subsection \u201cUnstructured leader sequence upstream of <i>IFRD1</i> uORF is necessary for stress resistance\u201d."
