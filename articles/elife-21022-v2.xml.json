Here we characterize lobula columnar (LC) cells, a class of <i>Drosophila</i> VPNs that project to distinct central brain structures called optic glomeruli. We anatomically describe 22 different LC types and show that, for several types, optogenetic activation in freely moving flies evokes specific behaviors. The activation phenotypes of two LC types closely resemble natural avoidance behaviors triggered by a visual loom. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging reveals that these LC types respond to looming stimuli, while another type does not, but instead responds to the motion of a small object. Activation of LC neurons on only one side of the brain can result in attractive or aversive turning behaviors depending on the cell type. Our results indicate that LC neurons convey information on the presence and location of visual features relevant for specific behaviors."

This table includes information on split-GAL4 hemidrivers (the AD and DBD halves), the\u00a0behavioral penetrance for each of the five examined phenotypes, and trial and fly counts, from both the arena and single-fly assays. While the raw data counts within each assay are the same, a small number of trials could not be scored by either manual annotation or automatic tracking; as a result, there are some small differences in the number of quantified data points for the two scoring methods. Use of fly culture media different from standard cornmeal molasses food with supplemental retinal is indicated as follows: ret-: standard cornmeal molasses food without supplemental retinal. Vit-: Vitamin A-deficient food based on the\u00a0grape juice recipe (see Materials and methods) with supplemental retinal. Vit-, ret-: Vitamin A-deficient food without supplemental retinal. norpA indicates flies that are rendered blind by a null mutation in the norpA gene, <i>norpA[36]</i>.

Here we characterize lobula columnar (LC) cells, a class of <i>Drosophila</i> VPNs that project to distinct central brain structures called optic glomeruli. We anatomically describe 22 different LC types and show that, for several types, optogenetic activation in freely moving flies evokes specific behaviors. The activation phenotypes of two LC types closely resemble natural avoidance behaviors triggered by a visual loom. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging reveals that these LC types respond to looming stimuli, while another type does not, but instead responds to the motion of a small object. Activation of LC neurons on only one side of the brain can result in attractive or aversive turning behaviors depending on the cell type. Our results indicate that LC neurons convey information on the presence and location of visual features relevant for specific behaviors."

Doing so requires their visual systems to extract information about the presence of ethologically relevant visual features from diverse and dynamic sensory landscapes. Most organisms with elaborated nervous systems compartmentalize this task; in vertebrates and insects, for example, visual processing begins in specialized brain regions of similar general structure, called, respectively, the retina and the optic lobe (<a href=\"#bib80\">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</a>). The signals computed in these early visual areas are then conveyed to different higher order brain regions by visual projection neurons (VPNs); ultimately these signals must be passed on to the neural circuits that control behaviors."

Studies of such neurons, for example of retinal ganglion cells in vertebrates and lobula plate tangential cells in insects, have provided insights into both the computations performed by the early visual system and the visual information that is available to higher brain regions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Borst, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Gollisch and Meister, 2010</a>). However, the relationship between signals encoded by the VPNs and visual behaviors has been difficult to systematically explore in any animal. Compared to photoreceptor neurons, which primarily respond to local luminance changes, VPNs can show much more specialized responses, some of which have been interpreted as encoding visual features directly relevant for specific behaviors, for example the presence of prey (<a href=\"#bib50\">Lettvin et al., 1959</a>) or predators (<a href=\"#bib104\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>).

Each neuropil has a repetitive structure of several hundred retinotopically-arranged columns that support the parallel processing of visual signals from different points in space. Neurons projecting out of the optic lobes originate in the medulla, lobula and lobula plate with the majority from the latter two, deeper neuropil layers. The response properties of several lobula plate VPNs have been characterized in great detail, mainly through studies in larger flies (<a href=\"#bib7\">Borst et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Krapp et al., 1998</a>). These lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs) show strongly directionally selective responses to a variety of motion stimuli and some LPTCs have been proposed to function as matched filters for the complex optic flow patterns associated with a fly\u2019s movements (<a href=\"#bib46\">Krapp et al., 1998</a>). Many recent advances have also revealed key components of the upstream circuitry that provides LPTCs with their direction-selective response properties (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib8\">Borst [2014]</a>). However, visual processing of stimuli other than wide-field motion is generally much less well understood. For example, flies respond to the movement, shape and position of objects (<a href=\"#bib11\">Card and Dickinson, 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Coen et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Egelhaaf, 1985a</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">1985b</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">1985c</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ernst and Heisenberg, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">G\u00f6tz, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Maimon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Ofstad et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Reichardt and Wenking, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Robie et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Tang et al., 2004</a>) or to different wavelengths of light (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Karuppudurai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Melnattur et al., 2014</a>). The neural substrates of these behaviors are largely unidentified but have often been proposed to involve neurons in the lobula. A major role of the lobula in visual processing is also indicated by anatomy, since the vast majority of medulla outputs project to the lobula (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</a>)."

The LC neurons are the most numerous VPNs of the lobula and, as we show here, can be divided into over twenty distinct types. Anatomical characteristics of typical LC neurons are illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. Each LC type comprises multiple neurons of similar morphology whose individual dendritic arbors spread across only part of the array of lobula columns but which, with a few exceptions, cover the entire visual field as a population (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Strausfeld and Okamura, 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,F,K</a>). These anatomical properties contrast with those of LPTCs whose large dendritic arbors vary across lobula plate columns but are sufficiently stereotyped to be individually identifiable across animals. In addition to their dendritic arrangements, the second anatomical hallmark of most LC neurons is the convergence of their axons onto cell-type specific target regions in the central brain (<a href=\"#bib67\">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Strausfeld and Okamura, 2007</a>). These target regions represent distinct neuropil structures often referred to as \u2018optic glomeruli\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib86\">Strausfeld, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Strausfeld and Okamura, 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B,D,E,G\u2013I</a>), named by analogy to the similarly shaped subunits of the antenna lobes, the olfactory glomeruli (<a href=\"#bib48\">Laissue et al., 1999</a>). Similar to olfactory glomeruli, the optic glomeruli are enriched for synaptic sites and can be directly visualized with general neuropil markers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ito et al., 2014</a>). The most prominent of these optic glomeruli are found in the ventrolateral central brain, specifically the posterior ventrolateral protocerebrum (PVLP) and the posterior lateral protocerebrum (PLP) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In addition, a small dorsal brain region with a glomerular structure, the anterior optic tubercle (AOTu) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), is considered a specialized optic glomerulus and also receives LC cell inputs (<a href=\"#bib67\">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Strausfeld and Okamura, 2007</a>)."

LC neurons receive feed forward visual inputs from photoreceptors in the retina via a series of optic lobe interneurons (a few lamina neurons, in brown, and transmedullary neurons [Tm], in green, are illustrated as examples in [A]). This places LC neurons at least 2\u20133 synapses downstream of the photoreceptors.

LC19 arbors in the lobula are located mainly in layers Lo5 and Lo6, those of LC23 neurons primarily in layers Lo2 and Lo4 (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for details of lobula stratification). LC19 processes are present across the entire lobula; those of LC23 appear to cover only the anterior, not the posterior lobula. Images show projection views (generated in Vaa3D) of MCFO labeled neurons together with the anti-Brp neuropil marker (grey).

While the dendrites of different LC neuron types are arranged in overlapping retinotopic arrays in the lobula, their synaptic termini in the central brain are grouped into discrete glomeruli, most of which receive input from a single LC neuron type (<a href=\"#bib67\">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Strausfeld and Okamura, 2007</a>). The retinotopic structure of the lobula and other early visual neuropils is thought to facilitate the extraction of visual features from the spatiotemporal patterns of the activity of visual interneurons (ultimately going back to patterns of photoreceptor activity). By contrast, the organization of LC target regions into separate glomeruli, which is similar to the projection pattern of olfactory receptor neurons in the antennal lobe, suggests that different cell types already encode distinct features (such as the presence of specific odorants in the olfactory system) and that spatial information is of secondary importance."

We first use these lines to provide detailed anatomical descriptions of 22 different LC types about half of which had not been previously described by Otsuna and Ito (<a href=\"#bib67\">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</a>). For each type, we examine not only the position and shape of the target glomerulus but also many other anatomical features (such as lateral spread and layer patterns of lobula arbors, cell body positions and cell numbers), significantly extending the analyses in other studies. We find that each LC type is characterized by a distinct layer distribution of dendrites in the lobula and, with a few exceptions, a unique axonal output region in the central brain. Comparison of these output regions with the pattern of optic glomeruli indicates that most prominent glomeruli are the target regions of a specific LC type. Our glomerulus map largely concurs with the results of Panser et al. but is based on higher resolution images that allow us to better separate adjacent glomeruli and to define the target regions of two additional LC cell types. We also show that another LC type can be subdivided into four anatomically and genetically defined subtypes. Independent of the overall anatomical transformation associated with the convergence of LC neuron axons into glomeruli (see above), LC neuron axons of a given type might either retain or discard retinotopy within their target glomerulus. Potential retinotopy within optic glomeruli has not been examined in detail and images with sparse labeling of LC neurons have been interpreted as arguing either for or against such axonal retinotopy (<a href=\"#bib67\">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Panser et al., 2016</a>). To further explore possible retinotopy within individual glomeruli, we used multicolor stochastic labeling of individual LC neurons. In general, we did not observe detectable retinotopy of LC neuron axons within a glomerulus. However, we did identify a few exceptions; in particular, axonal projections of LC neurons to the AOTu retain retinotopy for azimuthal positions, suggesting a specialized role of the AOTu in the processing of spatial information. Stochastic labeling also allowed us to examine additional anatomical features of LC cells such as the\u00a0dendritic arbor size and shape that cannot be observed at the population level. We also used our new driver lines to explore behaviors associated with LC neuron activity, by examining the response of freely behaving flies to optogenetic depolarization of individual LC types. In several cases such activation triggers distinct, highly penetrant behavioral responses that resemble natural, visually guided behaviors. In particular, using high-speed videography we show that two of these evoked behaviors, flight-initiating jumping (takeoff) and backward walking, resemble natural avoidance behaviors that can be elicited by a looming visual stimulus. Moreover, the two LC types whose activation evokes these avoidance behaviors respond to looming stimuli as assayed by two-photon calcium imaging. The encoding of looming is not a feature of all LC types, as we found a third LC type to be selectively responsive to small object motion. Finally, we present evidence that activation of LC neurons on only one side of the brain can induce attractive or aversive turning behaviors, depending on the cell type. Taken together, our anatomical and functional data suggest that each LC type conveys information about the presence and at least general location of a behaviorally relevant visual feature. Although details of our data suggest further downstream integration of signals from different LC types, the highly penetrant phenotypes we observe with activation of some LC types are consistent with a simple model for the initiation of several behaviors."

Dickson, personal communication). We searched for cell types that consisted of many similar cells which as populations covered the entire array of visual columns in the lobula and whose axonal projections converged onto single glomerulus-like regions in the ipsilateral central brain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Other types of lobula VPNs were also identified in the screen but will not be further characterized here. These included a number of additional LC-like cell types which were excluded here because of the different structure or location of their target regions or because their combined dendrites appeared to be restricted to lobula subregions corresponding to only part of the visual field. Some examples of such cells, which include the previously described LC14 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hassan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</a>), are shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. In addition to neurons having dendrites in the lobula, we identified columnar VPNs associated with other optic neuropils that also had glomerular target regions (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for an example) but we excluded them from further analysis. For the cell types that met our criteria, we used the split-GAL4 intersectional approach (<a href=\"#bib55\">Luan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</a>), where GAL4 activity is restricted to the overlap in the expression patterns of two GAL4 driver lines, to generate driver lines with predominant or exclusive expression in individual LC types. In combination, the split-GAL4 driver lines reported here have expression in 22 different types of LC neurons. Seven of these LC types (LC4, LC6, LC9-LC13) have been previously described (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</a>). For consistency, we named new LC types by extending a previously used numbering scheme (<a href=\"#bib67\">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</a>) and coordinated these names with another group that also found, and very recently reported (<a href=\"#bib69\">Panser et al., 2016</a>), several of the new LC neurons described here; except for the cell types shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (LC14, LC19, LC23), the gaps in the sequence of LC cell type names (LC1-LC3, LC5, LC7 and LC8) are due to the naming scheme and do not correspond to known LC types not covered in this study. Anatomical characteristics of the different LC neuron types are described below; for genotypes of the split-GAL4 driver lines see Materials and methods. Overall expression patterns of the main split-GAL4 lines used in this study can be found in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>.

While we have yet to generate specific split-GAL4 drivers for this additional LPLC cell type and therefore did not further characterize these neurons here, their overlap with LC22 terminals was directly confirmed by co-labeling of single cells of both types in the same specimen (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

By contrast, within the target glomerulus (<b>B</b>,<b>C</b>; two roughly orthogonal views are shown) the arbors of the same cells are intermingled without an obvious correlation to the retinotopic pattern in the lobula.

Most LC9 cells have presynaptic arbors that spread through more than one half of the glomerulus but do not fill it completely (<b>F,G</b>). Comparison of the approximate positions of arbors of individual LC9 cells in the glomerulus (<b>F,G</b>) with the AP positions of their dendrites in the lobula (<b>D,E</b>) suggests some retinotopy within the glomerulus, though with very low spatial resolution: For example, out of 57 examined LC9 cells, all of the cells (27/27) with axon terminals in the anterior-ventral tip of the glomerulus (such as the green cell in [<b>F</b>] and both cells in [<b>G</b>]) also had dendrites in the posterior half of the lobula while this was the case for only a few of the remaining LC9 cells (6/30).

Individual cells were labeled using MCFO. Reconstructed views of reoriented subtstacks generated in Vaa3D are shown. For both LC10a and LC10d, similar results were observed for LC10 cells from five optic lobes, each with at least three labeled cells. Analyses of MCFO-labeled LC10b (36 cells from 18 brains) and LC10c (33 cells from 17 brains) single cells also showed an approximate correspondence between AP positions of dendrites in the lobula and DV positions of axonal arbors in the AOTu. LC10b cells also showed considerable variation in their lateral-medial spread within the medial zone of the AOTu but further analyses will be required to explore possible correlations between these differences and arbor positions in the lobula.

Single confocal sections with anti-Brp in grey, syt-smHA in magenta and/or a membrane marker (pJFRC225-5XUAS-IVS-myr::smFLAG in <i>VK00005</i>) in green are shown for each cell type as indicated in (<b>A</b>). Although the interpretation of such fainter syt-smHA labeling patterns is not always straightforward, they strongly suggest that at least some LC neurons (including cell types not shown in this Figure) also have presynaptic sites within the lobula. Additional details on syt-HA labeling in the lobula are provided in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>. Strong syt-smHA labeling in layer Lo6 in (<b>E</b>) appears to be mainly due to LC10b cells (compare with (<b>C</b>) for LC10d cells alone), though a lobula intrinsic neuron type weakly labeled by the split-GAL4 driver line used might also contribute to the pattern.

All three LPLC cell types have processes in all lobula plate layers and several layers of the lobula but differ in details of arbor structure and layer patterns.

Solid and dashed lines indicate median and inner-quartile range, respectively. Grey rectangles in this and other panels signify optogenetic stimulation with red light. (<b>C,D</b>) Notched box plots showing the distribution of mean velocity (<b>C</b>) and angular speed (<b>D</b>), before, during, and after optogenetic stimulation, of pBDPGAL4U control (black) and LC16 activated (red) flies. The increased translational velocity of LC16 flies compared to controls prior to CsChrimson stimulation appears to be due to reduced walking of the control flies after repeated red light stimulation: The data in (<b>B\u2013D</b>) are averages from multiple trials (trials 1 to trial 5) with the maximum light stimulus from experiments with increasing intensities (i.e. the same flies were stimulated repeatedly within an experiment with a series of light intensities; see Materials and methods). To examine whether the apparent higher basal locomotion of LC16 flies during pre-stimulation light off was a response to prior stimulations, we compared trial 1 data to trial 5 data from the experiments in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, because in these experiments only the maximum light stimulus was used (data for different LC16 split- GAL4 lines and for the different control flies shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> were pooled). Data for trial 1 showed no pre-stimulus difference between LC16 and control flies (p=0.88, by Wilcox rank sum test), while locomotion was reduced for the controls in trial 5 (p&lt;0.01). (<b>E,F</b>) Jitter plots showing the distribution of mean velocity and angular speed during optogenetic stimulation of control and LC neuron driver lines in the arena (<b>E</b>) and single-fly (<b>F</b>) assays. Each dot represents an individual trial. A conservative threshold is set at the 97.7th percentile of the pBDPGAL4U control distribution, indicated by dashed red lines. Grey and black dots represent trials within and outside of the normal range, respectively. For walking, trials above the top red line are counted as displaying a forward walking phenotype and trials below the bottom red line are counted as displaying a backward walking phenotype. For turning, trials above the red line are counted as displaying a turning phenotype."

To further explore sources of variability in these experiments, using LC16 activation induced backward walking as an example, we reanalyzed the data by pooling results for either all flies of the same trial (per trial) or all trials of the same fly (per fly). This revealed different degrees of variability both across flies within the same trial and across trials for the same fly. Nonetheless, this variability does not change our conclusion that LC16 activation results in a strong backward walking response."

The images show reconstructed views of CsChrimson expression in the lobula (generated using Vaa3D and manually aligned using the anti-Brp reference marker). Approximate layer positions are indicated on the left. Scale bar represents 10 \u00b5m. CsChrimson expression using two additional LC10 driver lines (SS00941 and SS00942) resulted in unexpected uncoordinated behaviors in response to optogenetic activation that precluded analyses of reaching behavior. These lines, which are related as they only differ from each other in the insertion site of the AD hemidriver (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>), were therefore excluded from further analyses. (<b>C</b>) Single cell labeling reveals subtype expression patterns of LC10 driver lines. Overall lobula expression of an LC10 split-GAL4 line (SS02664) (top panel; displayed as in <b>B</b>) and examples of MCFO labeled single cells from this line (bottom panels) are shown. LC10 subtypes (indicated below the images) of single cells were assigned based on layer pattern, arbor size and shape as follows: LC10c cells mainly arborize in layer Lo5B with some processes in the adjacent layers. LC10a cells also have arbors in Lo5B, but differ from LC10c by having additional processes in the more distal layers Lo2, Lo3 and Lo4. LC10b and LC10d differ from LC10a and LC10c by having major arbors in Lo6 and only few processes in Lo5B. Their distal arbors reach Lo4. LC10b cells are wider than LC10d cells and show many small varicosities (presumably presynaptic sites; compare <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>) in Lo6. LC10 neurons also differ in their axonal paths in the AOTu: LC10a and LC10d axons run both dorsally and ventrally, and LC10b and LC10c only ventrally (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>; also see <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

A \u2018stop-cassette\u2019 reporter (pJFRC300-20XUAS-FRT&gt;-dSTOP-FRT&gt;-CsChrimson-mVenus in <i>attP18</i>) was used for Flp-recombinase mediated control of CsChrimson expression. This reporter/effector construct (small schematic in the right brain hemisphere of the larval brains in the illustration) is based on the \u2018Flp-out\u2019 design (<a href=\"#bib88\">Struhl and Basler, 1993</a>). It contains 20 Upstream Activating Sequences (UAS) and a core promoter (grey rectangle) for GAL4-activated expression, a transcriptional terminator (white rectangle with a red prohibition sign) flanked by Flp-recombinase target (FRT) sites (black triangles), and a CsChrimson-mVenus fusion gene (green rectangle). Heat shock induces expression of the Flp-recombinase which can excise the transcriptional terminator, allowing expression of CsChrimson-mVenus under the control of a split-GAL4 driver (not shown). By expressing a limiting amount of Flp-recombinase early in development (first instar larval stage), stochastic stop-cassette excision occurs in LC precursor cells, generating adults in which most or all neurons of one LC neuron type (determined by the split-GAL4 driver) express CsChrimson-mVenus in either no, one, or two optic lobes. (<b>B</b>) Strong backward walking behavior requires bilateral LC16 activation. Notched box plots showing the distribution of mean velocity for bilateral LC16 activation (trial count\u00a0=\u00a0101, fly count\u00a0=\u00a010), unilateral LC16 activation (trial count\u00a0=\u00a075, fly count\u00a0=\u00a07) and no labeling controls (trial count\u00a0=\u00a0114, fly count\u00a0=\u00a011). Behavioral responses of individual flies were assayed and their brains were subsequently dissected to determine expression patterns. Unilateral LC16 activation produced far less backward walking than bilateral activation (Mann-Whitney test, p&lt;0.001). (<b>C</b>) Unilateral activation of LC16 and LC10 induces aversive and attractive turning, respectively. Notched box plots showing the distribution of mean angular velocity for different labeling categories of LC16 and LC10: For LC16, trial and fly counts are the same as in (<b>B</b>). For LC10, bilateral (trial count\u00a0=\u00a091, fly count\u00a0=\u00a08), unilateral (trial count\u00a0=\u00a0268, fly count\u00a0=\u00a024) and no labeling (trial count\u00a0=\u00a0281, fly count\u00a0=\u00a022). For unilateral activation, behavioral data from animals with labeling only on the left brain hemisphere were reversed and combined with those from animals with labeling only on the right brain hemisphere. In addition to flies with clear bilateral or unilateral expression, 18 flies in the LC10 stochastic activation experiments had expression in both brain halves but showed differences in the apparent number of labeled LC10 cells between the hemispheres. Because of the wide range of these labeling differences we did not include these flies in the above analysis. However, the behavioral results for this group also showed a turning bias towards the side with stronger labeling (see <a href=\"#fig13s1\">Figure 13\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that even small differences of LC10 activation between the two hemispheres may be sufficient to induce ipsilateral turning."

To facilitate visualization of combinations of LC cell types, we aligned data collected from confocal stacks of individual driver lines to a standard brain (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aso et al., 2014a</a>). Together, the LC neurons characterized in this study project to 19 distinct target regions in the ipsilateral central brain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). In addition to the shape and location of these target regions, the axonal paths followed by LC neurons are also stereotyped with individual cells of the same type showing a similar projection pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,D,G</a>). To compare LC neuron target areas to the position of optic glomeruli, we focused on the PVLP where several large glomeruli can be readily visualized with general markers of synaptic density (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ito et al., 2014</a>). LC neuron target regions in the PVLP visualized by expression of a presynaptic marker in LC neurons closely matched the glomerular neuropil pattern revealed by anti-Brp staining, which labels presynaptic active zones (<a href=\"#bib96\">Wagh et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This result confirmed optic glomeruli as the target regions of these LC neurons and identified LC input neurons for each of several glomeruli whose projection neuron inputs were unknown. In particular, our data show that each of the 12 most prominent glomeruli in the PVLP (or, in one case, the boundary region of PVLP and PLP) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) is the target of one columnar VPN type from the lobula. Ten of these glomeruli are the targets of typical LC cell types while two glomeruli receive inputs of neurons with dendrites in both lobula and lobula plate; we refer to these LC-like cells as LPLC1 and LPLC2. Similar cells have been described in other Diptera (<a href=\"#bib19\">Douglass and Strausfeld, 1998</a>). Although we visually screened the expression patterns of several thousand GAL4 lines, we did not observe additional cases where the terminal fields of a VPN similarly coincided with one of these glomeruli (as defined by anti-Brp labeling), suggesting that LC neurons are the primary inputs to these structures."

In addition to projections to the large PVLP glomeruli, we also characterized several LC neuron types that converged onto more posterior, often smaller regions in the PVLP and PLP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>).

Finally, several LC neuron types project to the large subunit of the AOTu (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013I</a>); the properties of these LC10 cells are discussed further below. In sum, our results provide a high resolution map of LC neuron target regions and establish a link between the pattern of glomeruli detected with general neuronal markers and the neuron projections of specific LC cell types. With a few exceptions, primarily the AOTu (discussed further below) and the target regions of LC25 and LC22, each glomerulus described here can be uniquely identified as the target region of a single LC neuron type that appears to be the major input to that glomerulus.

In the lobula, LC neuron dendrites form parallel retinotopic arrays, whereas their synaptic termini in the central brain are grouped into discrete glomeruli. However, it has not been examined in detail whether any retinotopy is preserved in the glomeruli; that is, whether the positions of the dendrites of individual LC neurons in the lobula and of their presynaptic terminals within their target glomerulus are correlated. To directly compare the relative positions of the dendrites of different LC cells of the same type in the lobula with the arrangement of the presynaptic arbors of the same cells, we examined samples in which several LC cells of the same type were stochastically labeled in distinct colors (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) using the Multicolor FlpOut (MCFO) technique (<a href=\"#bib62\">Nern et al., 2015</a>). These experiments revealed that most individual LC neurons, with the exceptions discussed below, had branched terminals that appeared to spread throughout their target glomerulus without obvious spatial restriction to subregions or correlation between the distributions of their dendritic arbors in the lobula and their presynaptic arbors in the glomerulus. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a> shows examples of this analysis for LC16. Qualitatively, most other LC cell types appeared similar to LC16 in that they lacked any obvious preservation of retinotopy at the glomerulus level; each individual cell\u2019s axonal terminal was intermingled with others, featuring pre-synaptic boutons throughout the glomerulus (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for examples of additional LC cell types). Of course, retinotopic patterns in the synaptic connections between these LC neurons and their targets that are not apparent at the resolution examined here may exist. LC9 is an example of a cell type that appeared to retain some retinotopy, though with very low spatial resolution, at the level of the axonal terminals: terminals of single LC9 cells expanded through only part of the glomerulus and their position correlated with the approximate position of the corresponding dendrites in the lobula (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013G</a>)."

LC10 cells have branched terminals similar to other LC neurons but with limited dorso-ventral (DV) spread so that individual cells did not cover the entire AOTu along this axis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I,J,L,M</a>). In the AOTu, the relative positions of presynaptic arborizations of LC10 cells along the DV axis of the AOTu largely matched the order of their dendrites along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the lobula (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,K</a>), though with more overlap between arbors in the AOTu compared to the lobula. By contrast, the DV positions of LC10 dendrites in the lobula were not obviously\u00a0correlated with arrangements of neuronal processes in the AOTu and the positions of different LC10 terminals largely overlapped along the lateral-medial (LM) and AP axes of the tubercle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I,J,L,M</a>). LC10 cells also differed in a second key respect from LC cell types innervating most other optic glomeruli; consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib67\">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</a>), we found that the AOTu is the target of axonal projections of several anatomically distinct LC10 subtypes. Our classification of LC10 cells is mainly based on the size and layer patterns of the lobula arbors of these neurons; these differences, which are predicted to reflect different presynaptic inputs to these cells, are described in detail below (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Previously reported subtype distinctions (<a href=\"#bib67\">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</a>) were based on differences of the axonal path (dorsal or ventral) within the AOTu, which we also observed but which do not unambiguously identify the subtypes described here, and distinct lateral-medial positions of LC10 terminals, which we did not find evidence for; all LC10 types labeled by our driver lines projected to the large medial zone (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ito et al., 2014</a>) of the AOTu (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013I</a>), while inputs to the lateral zone, previously interpreted as LC10C cells (<a href=\"#bib67\">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</a>), appear to be projections from the medulla (<a href=\"#bib68\">Otsuna et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Panser et al., 2016</a>). We refer to the subtypes defined here as LC10a-LC10d (lowercase letters) to distinguish them from the previously proposed LC10A-LC10C (<a href=\"#bib67\">Otsuna and Ito, 2006</a>). <a href=\"#bib17\">Costa et al. (2016)</a> also propose several new LC10 subtypes based on computational clustering of single cell data. These putative cell types are primarily defined by having axonal arbors that are restricted to different positions along the DV axis of the AOTu with corresponding regional patterns of their dendrites along the AP axis of the lobula. Our analyses of retinotopy of LC10 neurons using subtypes specific split-GAL4 lines showed that the axonal terminals of both LC10a (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H\u2013J</a>) and LC10d (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K\u2013M</a>) subtypes are retinotopically distributed along the full DV axis of the AOTu, suggesting that different subtypes form independent retinotopic maps that each cover the entire visual field. For this reason, we believe that the clustering method of Costa et al, which relied on the central brain arbors of LC cells, not their layer patterns in the lobula, led to a misclassification of groups of cells of LC10 neurons at different retinotopic positions as distinct cell types. In agreement with this possibility, attempts to identify GAL4 lines with specific expression in such regionally restricted LC10 subtypes were largely unsuccessful (<a href=\"#bib69\">Panser et al., 2016</a>). By contrast, our split-GAL4 driver lines provide genetic support for the LC10 subdivisions we describe here. In sum, within the AOTu the terminals of multiple LC cell types overlap, showing clear retinotopic spatial segregation along one axis."

Similar to other optic lobe neuropils, the lobula has a distinctly stratified structure (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Strausfeld, 1976</a>). To compare layer patterns across samples, we used the anti-Brp reference marker (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) to both directly identify lobula strata and to enable alignment of different optic lobes to a common reference. In the lobula, anti-Brp staining shows seven bands of alternating labeling intensity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>); examination of processes of identified neurons with known positions in the lobula indicated that these anti-Brp strata largely correspond to the previously described (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</a>) lobula layers Lo1 to Lo6 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), with Lo5 represented by two anti-Brp bands of different intensity. Comparison of the layer patterns of different LC cell types, each visualized using a specific split-GAL4 driver line, with the anti-Brp label indicated that, for a given type, layer patterns were similar throughout the lobula (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>) but differed for cells of different types (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). In some cases, differences between layer patterns of different LC cell types, though consistent across samples, were small (for example, between LC6 and LC16, LC4 and LC12 or LC25 and LC26) while other pairs of LC cell types occupied, except for connecting neurites, entirely non-overlapping sets of layers (for example, LC4/LC12/LC18 compared to LC25/LC26). In principle, distinct and apparently uniform layer patterns of LC neuron populations (as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>) could still consist of multiple cell types with distinct arbor stratifications that were not resolved in these images. However, for nearly all LC neuron types, we found that the layer patterns of individual cells that projected to the same target glomerulus were similar to each other and matched the overall layer patterns seen by labeling the entire cell populations using the type-specific split-GAL4 driver lines (compare LC4 and LC15 patterns in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E and D</a>, respectively; also see <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for examples of single cell labeling of lobula dendrites for all LC cell types). These results indicate that nearly all optic glomeruli receive input from a single LC neuron type that can be recognized independently by either the dendritic arbor stratification in the lobula or the axonal projection pattern."

The majority of our LC10-specific split-GAL4 drivers are expressed in more than one of the four LC10 subtypes. However, we identified several lines with subtype selectivity, including two lines with expression in a single subtype (see <a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This provides genetic support for the treatment of LC10a, LC10b, LC10c and LC10d as distinct, though related, cell types."

At one extreme, only LC4 cells have processes in layer Lo1; by contrast, all but three LC (LC4, LC12 and LC18) cell types have processes in layer Lo5. As anatomical overlap between different cells is a necessary condition for synapses between them, the different layer patterns of LC cells can provide clues to their potential connectivity: for example, some LC cell types with Lo5 dendrites might receive inputs from Tm neurons implicated in the processing of spectral information (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Karuppudurai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lin et al., 2016</a>) (Tm20, shown in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, is an example). However, since all lobula layers contain terminals of many neurons, connectivity cannot be inferred based on layer patterns alone, as not all the neuronal types that arborize in a shared layer will be synaptic partners. In addition, the lobula arbors of some LC neurons may be not only postsynaptic but also make some presynaptic contacts; we found that for several LC cell types the presynaptic marker (syt-smHA) used to visualize the target regions was also detectable, though much more weakly, in one or more lobula layers (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>), suggesting that some LC neurons are also presynaptic in the lobula."

As populations, the dendrites of each of the LC neuron types form retinotopic arrays that cover the entire lobula (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,F,K</a>). However, the lateral spread of individual LC neuron arbors in the lobula shows considerable cell-type specific variation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The lateral spread of the lobula arbors of cells of all LC types covered lobula regions corresponding to several of the\u00a0~750 visual columns within each eye. The largest arbor spreads were observed for LC11, estimated to be over 60 columns (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>) and LC25, approximately a hundred columns for some cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). The smallest arbors were those of LC10a (~10 columns; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). For comparison, some of the medulla inputs to the lobula have lobula arbors corresponding to\u00a0~1 visual column (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) and some lobula tangential cells span all visual columns of the lobula as single cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Since most LC cell types did not show obvious retinotopy within their target glomeruli, we propose that the distinct arbor spreads of different LC cells determine the spatial extent over which their specific response properties are computed, rather than provide retinotopic information at different spatial resolutions."

As discussed in the Introduction, the anatomical reorganization resulting from the convergence of LC axons into largely cell-type specific glomeruli, has led to the speculation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Mu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Strausfeld and Okamura, 2007</a>) that the activity of members of a given LC cell type primarily signals the presence of a particular behaviorally relevant visual feature rather than its precise location. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that strong artificial activation of an individual LC neuronal cell type might elicit a behavioral response that could provide clues to the function of these neurons. To explore this possibility, we conducted an optogenetic activation screen, using our LC cell-type specific split-GAL4 driver lines to genetically target expression of CsChrimson, a red light-activated cation channel (<a href=\"#bib45\">Klapoetke et al., 2014</a>), to specific LC neuron populations."

We transiently depolarized these cells with a short pulse of red light in the context of two independent, complementary behavioral assays (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). One assay used a circular arena (100 mm diameter and 3 mm high) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aso et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Klapoetke et al., 2014</a>), in which groups of about 25 freely walking flies (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>) were subjected to periodic, repeated light pulses. The second was a single-fly assay (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, see Materials and methods) in which flies were released individually onto a small (5 mm<sup>2</sup>) open platform where they were exposed to light activation and their response recorded in two views (side and bottom) at high temporal and spatial resolution, permitting analysis of behaviors with greater detail. All activation experiments were carried out under infrared light to permit video recording while minimizing potential activation of CsChrimson by ambient light."

In some cases, the same behavior was elicited from activation of different LC cell types. For example, five different cell types (LC4, LC6, LC15, LPLC1 and LPLC2) drove highly penetrant jumping in at least one of the two assays. In other cases, multiple behaviors were observed from activation of a single LC neuron type. For example, LPLC2 activation elicited both jumping and backward walking behaviors with about equal penetrance in the arena assay. Overall, when activated, nearly half of LC neuron types (10/22) drove one of the five behaviors we assessed in a majority of flies tested. Since we did not independently confirm CsChrimson stimulation of LC neurons in a separate assay, we cannot exclude the possibility that the absence of a clear behavioral response of some LC cell types may have been simply due to insufficient activation of these neurons under our experimental conditions."

We combined our split-GAL4 driver lines with a <i>norpA</i> mutation that renders the fly blind. CsChrimson activation of these lines produced the same behaviors as seen in non-<i>norpA</i> flies (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>), indicating that the behavior is not triggered by the light itself (behavioral penetrance measured in genetically blind flies and experimental lines were not significantly different, binomial test, p=0.06 for jumping, p=0.10 for backward walking and p=0.40 for turning). Additionally, parental lines that do not express CsChrimson as well as flies reared on food without supplemental retinal show little or no jumping, backward walking or turning in response to red light (mean penetrance of 0% for jumping, 7% for backward walking and 3% for turning) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). We also tested several additional, genetically different, split-GAL4 driver lines with targeted LC6 or LC16 expression (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and found that these lines produced the same, highly penetrant jumping or backward walking and turning behaviors (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>; 80\u2013100%\u00a0penetrance for jumping, 89\u201395% for backward walking and 29\u201336% for turning). These results confirm that the distinct LC6 and LC16 phenotypes observed in the screen are due to the experimental activation of these cell types. Furthermore, an independent thermogenetic activation screen of more than 2000 lines from the Janelia GAL4 collection also identified the LC6 and LC16 cell types as producing the jumping and backward walking phenotypes through correlation between behavior and anatomy (A A Robie and K Branson, personal communication, September 2016). Thus, activation of specific LC neuron types can result in highly penetrant, cell-type specific behavioral responses."

However, the two LC10 split-GAL4 driver lines we used in our screen produced different activation phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). Unlike other LC cell types, LC10 can be divided into four subtypes that each has a distinct layer pattern in the lobula (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), while projecting to the same target glomerulus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013I</a>). These different lobula layer patterns suggest different presynaptic inputs and, as a result, different visual response properties of LC10 subtypes that may be associated with different behavioral outputs. To confirm the reaching behavior observed in the screen with additional LC10 driver lines and to look for possible correlations between subtype expression and this behavior, we assayed a panel of 15 LC10 split-GAL4 driver lines (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>; <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Upon activation, eight LC10 lines showed strong reaching responses (&gt;60%) and six driver lines showed medium or little reaching (&lt;30%) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Consistent with possible functional differences between LC10 subtypes in these experiments, we found that the expression patterns of the lines with the strongest reaching behavior appeared to differ from those of the other lines by having denser processes in more distal lobula layers (mainly ~ Lo3 and Lo4) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>)."

Although individual LC10 cells showed considerable morphological variability, nearly all labeled LC10 cells in these lines could be readily classified as belonging to one of the four subtypes. This allowed us to determine the presence of LC10a, b, c or d in each driver line. We found LC10a and/or LC10d cells in all lines with strong reaching phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These lines included one split-GAL4 driver (OL0019B, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a> \u2018a only\u2019) that appeared specific for the LC10a type and another driver (SS03822, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a> \u2018d only\u2019) specific for the LC10d type. Control experiments confirmed that the observed reaching behavior did not result from a simple response to light or from unrelated differences in genetic background (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). Thus, activation of LC10a or LC10d neurons alone is sufficient to drive highly penetrant reaching behavior. The lines with weaker reaching phenotypes showed labeling of LC10b and LC10c cells and little or no expression in the other two LC10 subtypes, further suggesting that, unlike LC10a or LC10d, LC10b and LC10c neurons only have a minor, if any, role in generating the reaching behavior."

By contrast, LC6 and LC16 are examples of LC cell types that have very similar arbor stratification in the lobula, but project to distinct optic glomeruli (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A,B</a>, also see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). Despite the similarity in their lobula arbors, LC6 and LC16 show different, highly penetrant, activation-induced behaviors\u2014jumping and backward walking, respectively (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media6\">6</a>). The \u2018jumping\u2019 phenotype of LC6 is reminiscent of fly takeoff, a behavior that occurs both spontaneously and in response to specific visual stimuli such as a predator-mimicking loom (<a href=\"#bib11\">Card and Dickinson, 2008b</a>). To further explore this similarity, we made use of the single-fly assay that provides a platform in which optogenetically triggered behaviors, such as LC6-mediated jumping, and responses to specific visual stimuli can be directly compared in identical experimental conditions. To visually elicit takeoff behavior, we presented flies with a looming stimulus previously shown to mimic a predator\u2019s approach and trigger fast escape responses (<a href=\"#bib95\">von Reyn et al., 2014</a>). We compared high-speed videos of these flies to similar recordings of the jumping phenotype resulting from optogenetic depolarization of LC6. For the flies that took off in response to the looming stimulus at 90\u00b0 azimuth (47/174 flies) we observed a consistent, coordinated behavioral sequence that started with the fly beginning to elevate its wings, followed by rapid middle (jumping) leg extension and initiation of flight as previously described (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Card and Dickinson, 2008b</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">von Reyn et al., 2014</a>). Flies perform the same sequence when taking off voluntarily, however the elevation of their wings is slower (<a href=\"#bib10\">Card and Dickinson, 2008a</a>), resulting in a significantly longer-duration takeoff sequence than those evoked by looming stimuli. Strikingly, the CsChrimson-mediated LC6 depolarization not only produced a takeoff with this same sequence of events (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>), but the duration of the takeoff sequence was more similar to that of a looming-evoked takeoff than a voluntary one performed when no stimulus was present (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11D</a>). Thus, LC6 depolarization results in a behavior very closely resembling a looming-evoked escape response."

When a fast-approaching looming stimulus was presented in front of the fly at 0\u00b0 azimuth, many of the flies that did not take off during the observation period instead responded with a backward walking behavior (174/200 flies) similar to that induced by optogenetic depolarization of LC16 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11E</a>). It has been shown that backward walking can also be part of a fly\u2019s response to a predator. For example, upon close encounter with a nymphal praying mantis, wild-caught <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> flies have been reported to occasionally respond with a backward walking or \u2018retreat\u2019 behavior usually followed by turning (<a href=\"#bib70\">Parigi et al., 2014</a>). We found that looming and LC16 depolarization both caused flies to move backward, and they do so with similar speeds. In contrast, without a visual stimulus, flies on the platform moved less, and their average movements were in a forward direction (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11F</a>). These comparisons show that LC6 and LC16 activation phenotypes resemble typical, visually guided behaviors."

We presented the same looming stimuli used in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a> to flies that expressed the inward-rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 in LC6 or LC16 neurons and to control flies (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Neither cell type appeared to be essential for the assayed behaviors: No reduction of backward walking compared to controls was observed for LC16 (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and a reduced jump frequency when blocking LC6 was apparent only for the fast loom (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, no difference in takeoff sequence duration was observed (<a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

However, during most natural visually guided behaviors, flies respond not only to the general presence of a particular visual feature but also to its location. For example, flies use visual cues to orient toward the far side of a gap when attempting to cross it (<a href=\"#bib75\">Pick and Strauss, 2005</a>) or toward another fly during courtship behavior (<a href=\"#bib16\">Coen et al., 2016</a>). Flies also adjust their takeoff direction relative to the azimuthal orientation of a looming stimulus (<a href=\"#bib11\">Card and Dickinson, 2008b</a>) and show a range of orientation behaviors that depend on the location of objects (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aptekar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bahl et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Heisenberg and Wolf, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Maimon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Reiser and Dickinson, 2010</a>). Such orientation behaviors must depend on neural circuits that convey the spatial location of specific visual features. Indeed, simultaneous activation of most or all LC neurons of a particular type, as in the experiments described above, is probably rather uncommon under natural conditions, and may partially explain why our activation screen revealed robust phenotypes for only half of the LC cell types. Taking LC11 as an illustrative example, if a function of this population is to signal the presence of a small moving object to downstream circuits, then it is not surprising that activating all LC11 neurons simultaneously failed to result in a coherent behavioral response. While our anatomical data suggest that most LC neurons largely discard retinotopic information, the inputs from the fly\u2019s two eyes remain distinct."

By using a construct in which GAL4-driven CsChrimson expression requires the prior removal of a transcriptional terminator, we can add temporal control to the cell-type specificity provided by the split-GAL4 driver (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13A</a>, and Materials and methods). If excision of the transcriptional terminator is induced for a brief time window early in development\u2014after the precursor populations for LC cells in the left and right optic lobes have been established, but before extensive cell proliferation has occurred\u2014animals can be readily obtained in which cells specific to that GAL4 driver on only one side of the animal are labeled. As a stochastic method, this approach also generates flies with bilateral labeling or no labeling (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13B</a>) providing both positive and negative controls of identical genotype and experimental history. To correlate behavioral responses with expression patterns, individual flies were tested in a modified arena (see Materials and methods) and then retrieved to examine labeling patterns by histology."

Expression patterns were scored as bilateral, unilateral (on the left or right), or no labeling (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13B</a>). The behaviors of flies with either bilateral or no expression were consistent with what we observed in our earlier experiments (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">9</a>). Unlike bilateral activation, unilateral LC16 optogenetic depolarization only rarely resulted in backward walking (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13B</a>), but instead generated strong turning responses (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13C</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). This turning behavior had a strong directional bias with turns predominantly away from the activated side (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13C</a>), suggesting a directional avoidance response. A possible interpretation of these results is that bilateral activation might represent a large object directly ahead, resulting in backward walking, while unilateral activation would mimic an object on one side of the fly, resulting in turning towards the opposite side. Interestingly, unilateral activation of LC10 also caused a strong turning bias, but in the opposite direction; flies predominantly made turns toward the activated side and the most common LC10 activation phenotypes were now turning responses rather than reaching (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13C</a>). Taken together, these data show that (1) bilateral and unilateral activation of LC neurons can have different behavioral consequences and (2) unilateral activation can result in either attractive or aversive turning behaviors, depending on the cell type. These results suggest that LC neurons can convey information on both the nature of a visual feature, by means of the differential activity of different LC cell types, and its location, by the differential activation of the same type in the two optic lobes."

Comprehensive anatomical analyses of the dendritic arbors and central brain projections of LC neurons support the notion that these cells encode diverse visual stimuli, distinct for each LC cell type, and convey this information to cell-type specific downstream circuits. Precise genetic tools that target individual LC cell types allowed us to explore the behavioral consequences of optogenetic activation of these cell types. We found that activating cells of single LC neuron types was often sufficient to evoke a range of coordinated behaviors in freely behaving flies. Using two-photon calcium imaging from head-fixed flies, we showed that two LC cell types with activation phenotypes similar to avoidance responses, selectively encode visual looming, a stimulus that also evokes similar avoidance behaviors, while a third cell type responded strongly to a small moving object. These results suggest that LC cell types encode visual features that are relevant for specific behaviors. Activation of LC cells in only one brain hemisphere can result in either an attractive or repulsive directional turning response, depending on cell type. Thus which LC neuron channel is activated determines the valence of the behavior, whereas comparison across the brain by two such channels of the same type provides information about the location of relevant visual features."

Our work extends these studies by providing a comprehensive description of LC neurons in <i>Drosophila</i>, including the identification of several previously unreported cell types. Further, we combine these anatomical analyses with the generation of highly specific genetic markers (split-GAL4 lines) for each cell type. We found that each of the 22 LC types described here has morphologically distinct dendritic arbors in the lobula with stereotyped arbor stratification, size and shape. As observed in the medulla, where synapse-level connectomics data are available for many cell types (<a href=\"#bib89\">Takemura et al., 2013</a>), different layer patterns and arbor shapes are likely to reflect differences in synaptic connectivity and neuronal computation. Arbors of LC neurons are found in all lobula strata, though with large differences between layers. Only LC4 (and perhaps LPLC1 and LPLC2) cells are potentially postsynaptic to neurons in the most distal lobula layer, Lo1, while other strata such as Lo4 and Lo5B include processes of more than half of the LC types. The presence of at least some LC dendrites in each lobula layer implies that all of the about 50 different interneuron types that convey visual information from the medulla, and to a lesser extent from the lobula plate, to the lobula, are potentially presynaptic to some LC cells, although a far smaller number is likely presynaptic to any single LC cell type. The predicted differences in the synaptic inputs to different LC cell types also suggest that they will differ in their responses to visual stimuli. Thus, individual LC neuron types are expected to encode specific visual stimuli, while the population of all LC cell types together should signal a wide range of behaviorally relevant visual features."

LC6 and LC16 showed stronger responses to a dark expanding disc than to related stimuli such as an expanding bright disk or a darkening stimulus that lacks the expanding motion. The reduction in the LC6 and LC16 responses when the edge motion is removed from the stimulus is precisely what is expected of loom-sensitive neurons and is reminiscent of behavioral studies in houseflies showing that darkening contrast combined with edge motion is the most effective stimulus for triggering takeoffs (<a href=\"#bib39\">Holmqvist and Srinivasan, 1991</a>). Consistent with their similar responses in the imaging experiments, LC6 and LC16 have very similar lobula layer patterns while LC11 has a different arbor stratification indicating that LC11 receives inputs from a different set of medulla cell types than LC6 and LC16."

For example, while LC6 and LC16 cells as populations are strongly excited by dark looming stimuli, we currently do not know whether individual LC6 and LC16 neurons, which have dendritic extents well below the maximum size of our looming stimuli, and also well below the size known to elicit maximal behavioral responses (<a href=\"#bib95\">von Reyn et al., 2014</a>), show the same response properties. Our anatomical data and genetic reagents provide a starting point for the additional functional and ultra-structural studies that will be required to elucidate the circuit mechanisms that produce the response properties of these and other LC cell types."

We extended previous analyses of LC neuron arbor convergence by directly visualizing multiple single LC cells in a glomerulus in the same fly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). These experiments revealed no detectable retinotopy of LC cell processes in most glomeruli even at this cellular level of resolution. It is possible that the responses of individual LC cells carry information about retinotopic position; given the comparatively small size of LC dendrites (the lateral spread of even the largest LC cells covers less than 20% of visual columns) and the retinotopic distribution of these dendrites in the lobula it would be surprising if they did not. Such retinotopic responses could for example be relevant for those LC cell types that appear to have presynaptic sites in the lobula and are thus likely to provide input to retinotopically organized circuits. However, with the caveat that we did not examine synapse-level connectivity, for most LCs the available anatomical information appears to support the view that much retinotopic information is discarded at the glomerulus level. Consistent with this anatomical observation, the calcium imaging experiments from single LC cell types revealed visual responses to localized stimuli that could be measured throughout a cross-section of the glomerulus without clear retinotopic arrangement of the responding axons (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B,C</a>). Because of the columnar nature and apparently restricted visual field of the dendrites of LC neurons, the features computed by individual LC neurons are likely to be well defined in subregions of the eye, with perhaps downstream circuits required to integrate these locally-extracted features, as discussed above for looming. We currently have little insight into how these computations are initiated in the optic glomeruli and this remains an exciting area for future investigation."

More specifically, we observed that the order of LC10 axonal terminals in the AOTu along the DV axis matches the sequence of AP positions of the corresponding dendrites in the lobula. This organization could facilitate synaptic interactions of LC10 cells corresponding to different azimuthal positions in the visual field with distinct target cells. Consistent with a possible general role of the AOTu in the\u00a0processing or the\u00a0relaying of retinotopic information, retinotopic responses have recently been observed in the dendrites of central complex neurons (<a href=\"#bib82\">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2013</a>) that, mainly based on work in other insects (<a href=\"#bib73\">Pfeiffer and Homberg, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Pfeiffer et al., 2005</a>), are thought to be synaptic targets of output neurons of the lateral zone of the AOTu (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ito et al., 2014</a>)."

We directly demonstrated this capability by genetically restricting optogenetic LC neuron activation to only one optic lobe. This unilateral activation evoked directional turning responses relative to the activated brain side. Thus, LC neuron signaling appears to convey information on both different visual features and their location. This may further extend the similarities to the antennal lobes where differences in odorant receptor neuron activity between the left and right antennal lobes may contribute to odorant tracking (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gaudry et al., 2013</a>)."

While specific activation phenotypes have been reported for a variety of cell types and behaviors, many of these studies have focused on command-like neurons thought to orchestrate specific motor programs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bidaye et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Flood et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lima and Miesenb\u00f6ck, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">von Reyn et al., 2014</a>). By contrast, the activation phenotypes we report here result from the optogenetic stimulation of different types of related visual projection neurons. A plausible interpretation of these results is that activation of LC neurons can mimic the presence of the visual features that these neurons normally respond to and thus elicits behavioral responses associated with these fictive stimuli. This possibility is supported by several lines of evidence from our studies of LC6 and LC16. First, optogenetic depolarization of each of these cell types evokes a specific behavioral response\u2014backward walking for LC16 and jumping for LC6\u2014that resembles a similar natural avoidance or escape behavior (<a href=\"#bib70\">Parigi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">von Reyn et al., 2014</a>). Second, backward walking and jumping can both also be elicited by presentation of a predator-mimicking visual loom (<a href=\"#bib11\">Card and Dickinson, 2008b</a>)\u00a0(and this study) and, third, in calcium imaging experiments both LC16 and LC6 showed a preferential response to a similar looming stimulus compared to a number of related stimuli. Although we did not explore LC10 response properties, we note that LC10-activation phenotypes also show similarities to natural behaviors: movements resembling the directed foreleg extension displayed during activation-evoked reaching occur, for example, during gap-climbing behavior (<a href=\"#bib75\">Pick and Strauss, 2005</a>) and in aggressive fly-fly interactions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2002</a>)."

In the simplest scenario, LC neuron depolarization could directly activate a single postsynaptic premotor descending interneuron that would then in turn trigger the observed behavior. This appears plausible in some cases: for example, activation of LC4 neurons (called ColA cells in larger flies) might evoke a jumping response via activation of the Giant Fiber (GF) cells, a pair of large descending neurons known to be postsynaptic to ColA (<a href=\"#bib83\">Strausfeld and Bassemir, 1983</a>) and LC4 (K von Reyn and GM Card, personal communication, September 2016) and which have a known role in escape behavior (<a href=\"#bib95\">von Reyn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Wyman et al., 1984</a>). For other LC cell types, there is currently no evidence suggesting a direct connection to descending neurons. For example, candidate descending neurons for the LC16 backward walking response, the moon-walker descending interneurons (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bidaye et al., 2014</a>), do not have dendrites in or near the LC16 glomerulus. Responses to diverse visual stimuli, some of which may derive from LC neuron activity, have also been observed in higher order brain centers without direct connections to LC neurons such as the central complex (<a href=\"#bib82\">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Weir and Dickinson, 2015</a>)."

Changes of the spatial pattern of LC neuron activation, as in our stochastic labeling experiments, can further modify activation phenotypes. For example, unilateral LC16 activation primarily evokes turning away from the location of LC16 activation, not backward walking, suggesting that the relative differences in LC16 activity between the two eyes can guide the direction of motor output through downstream signaling. Furthermore, several different LC neuron types may contribute to the same or similar behaviors, as suggested by the jumping phenotypes of LC4, LC6, LC15, LPLC1 and LPLC2. Presumably, visual signals and other information downstream of LC neurons are integrated to select appropriate behavioral actions. Such additional processing is also suggested by the cases of neurons with overlapping response properties but distinct activation phenotypes such as LC6 and LC16. We also note that some responses to LC neuron activation appear to be context dependent; for example, we observed reduced forward walking for several LC cell types on the platform of the single-fly assay that is much smaller than the arena used in the arena assay (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1E and F</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>)."

This predominance of avoidance phenotypes is perhaps not unexpected. Since escape responses have to be fast and reliably executed under many different conditions, neurons that signal features that can evoke escape may be particularly likely to show phenotypes in an activation screen. Given the importance of predator avoidance for fly survival, it appears plausible that a considerable fraction of visual output neurons might be utilized for the detection of visual threats ranging from looming to small objects (<a href=\"#bib12\">Card, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Maimon et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, it is likely that CsChrimson-mediated depolarization of an entire population of LC neurons is more similar to the pattern of neuronal activity induced by an imminent collision, and thus responses of many individual loom-sensitive neurons, so it is not surprising that our activation screen revealed at least two looming-sensitive neuron types."

Interestingly, neurons with avoidance-like activation phenotypes project to two separate groups of adjacent glomeruli, one in the dorsal PVLP (LC6, LC16 and also LC15) and one more ventral and medial (LC4, LPLC1 and LPLC2). This spatial organization may facilitate synaptic interactions of functionally related LC neuron types with common downstream pathways for a specific behavior. The second group is close to dendritic branches of the GF, large descending neurons required for short-mode responses in <i>Drosophila</i> and a postsynaptic partner of LC4/ColA (<a href=\"#bib83\">Strausfeld and Bassemir, 1983</a>)\u00a0(K von Reyn and GM Card, personal communication, September 2016) and possibly also the two LPLC cell types. LC6 terminals do not overlap with GF dendrites and LC6 cells may play a role in the GF-independent escape pathways that have been proposed in both <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fotowat et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">von Reyn et al., 2014</a>) and housefly (<a href=\"#bib40\">Holmqvist, 1994</a>).

Different visual output neurons with distinct tuning of their response properties to looming parameters such as speed, size, luminance change or edge detection might have evolved to ensure robust responses to avoid predators or collisions. It is, however, currently not known whether LPLC1, LPLC2, LC4 and LC15 are indeed sensitive to looming stimuli and if so, whether their response details differ from LC16, LC6 and each other. Nevertheless, the identification of these neurons opens the possibility to examine the potential contribution of several visual pathways to avoidance behaviors."

Our data strongly support existing proposals for LC cell types as feature-detecting neurons, which have been mainly based on the distinct anatomical properties of LC cells (<a href=\"#bib84\">Strausfeld and Okamura, 2007</a>). While these anatomical features distinguish LC neurons from many other VPNs, an\u00a0association of VPN pathways with specific behaviors is not unique to LC cell types. The notion that individual neuronal pathways are tuned for specific behavioral requirements is a prominent theme in invertebrate neuroethology, with these neurons described as \u2018matched filters\u2019 for behaviorally relevant features of the external world (<a href=\"#bib98\">Warrant, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Wehner, 1987</a>). A number of previously studied VPN pathways, outside of the LC subgroup, have been described as encoding specific behaviorally related visual stimuli. In particular, very similar to our results for LC6 and LC16, a group of tangential cells of the lobula and lobula plate (Foma-1 neurons) were found to respond to looming visual stimuli and, upon optogenetic activation, trigger escape responses (<a href=\"#bib18\">de Vries and Clandinin, 2012</a>). And perhaps most famously, the long-studied LPTCs, such as the HS and VS cells, integrate local motion signals so as to preferentially respond to global optic flow patterns that are remarkably similar to visual motion encountered during specific behavioral movements (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hausen, 1976</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">1982a</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Krapp et al., 1998</a>). Both our results and these findings are consistent with the idea that, at the outputs of the fly visual system, we find VPN pathways whose encoding properties are already well matched to particular fly behaviors or groups of behaviors. Matching the response properties of these deep sensory circuits to behavioral needs may be a general evolutionary solution to the challenge of dealing with the complexity of the visual world with limited resources."

Brain alignment to a template brain was achieved as described (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aso et al., 2014a</a>); to facilitate alignment of 63x tiles, most samples imaged as 63x were also imaged as whole brains at 20x. Initial image processing steps applied to most or all images (such as stitching and alignment) were as previously described (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aso et al., 2014a</a>). Alignment quality showed some variation between specimens and within subregions of the same specimen; samples with acceptable alignment quality in the relevant brain regions were identified by visual inspection of an overlay of the aligned anti-Brp patterns of the sample and the template brains.

The number of MCFO labeled single cells that were imaged and examined at high resolution varied: the lowest numbers was for LC26 (7 cells); the highest numbers were for LC10 subtypes (see <a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Estimates of cell numbers in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a> are based on manual counts using high resolution (63x) confocal stacks of the indicated split-GAL4 driver lines with pJFRC225-5XUAS-IVS-myr::smFLAG in <i>VK00005</i> as reporter (see above). Numbers are averages of counts of cells from three or more optic lobes. Lateral arbor spreads of LC neurons within lobula layers were estimated using substack projection images similar to those shown in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. A segmented line was drawn along the part of a lobula layer covered by a cell\u2019s arbors and the length of this line (measured using Fiji) divided by the maximum length of the entire layer determined in the same way. Arbor spreads were measured along both the AP and DV axes of the lobula. To estimate visual column coverage from these numbers, we assumed a circular eye of\u00a0~750 ommatidia, a uniform distribution of the corresponding visual columns across the lobula (i.e.\u00a0~31 columns along each lobula axis) and treated LC neuron arbors within each layer as planar and ellipse-shaped. All of these simplifications, which are approximations of described features of the visual system (<a href=\"#bib101\">Wolff and Ready, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1993</a>), limit the precision of these estimates, with larger overestimates expected for large arbors."

For looming stimulus experiments, a dark disc on a light background was projected on a screen above the platform with a non-linear expansion rate that mimicked that of an object approaching the fly with constant velocity (see <a href=\"#bib95\">von Reyn et al.

Video frames of the fly behavior were recorded at a rate of 6000 frames per second and a spatial resolution of 3 pixels per mm for the duration of each stimulus plus 500 ms after for optogenetic experiments and 150 ms after for looming experiments. For the looming-evoked jumping experiments, the looming stimulus was presented at an azimuth of 90\u00b0, which elicits jumping more frequently than any other azimuth (data not shown). For backward walking, the stimulus was presented at 0\u00b0, which elicits that behavior better than the 90\u00b0 azimuth stimulus used to elicit jumping.

                                "text": "Fly tracking videos were analyzed using either manual human annotation or software (<a href=\"https://github.com/wryanw/bowl_assay_tracking_and_analysis\">https://github.com/wryanw/bowl_assay_tracking_and_analysis</a>) written in MATLAB. The automated tracking identifies the center of mass of each fly and determines the fly\u2019s azimuthal orientation for every frame using a template-matching algorithm. The center of mass is determined in two dimensions in the arena assay and three dimensions in the single-fly assay, with 95% of the data having an error of less than five pixels. Position and orientation information for each fly was converted to velocity (to measure forward and backward walking) using a smoothing filter or angular velocity (to measure turning) using a sliding Savitzky-Golay filter (<a href=\"#bib66\">Orfanidis, 1996</a>). Forward and backward walking velocity was determined relative to the orientation of the fly, along its path of movement. For the arena assay, mean velocities were calculated for the full 1 s of optogenetic activation. For the single-fly assay, mean velocities for motion and turning were calculated for the first 350 ms after the onset of light stimulation during which most flies remained in the field of view on the assay\u2019s small platform. Reaching and jumping were elicited later than 350 ms in some cases, so a 500 ms cutoff was used for these behaviors. These average motion and turning values for individual flies were used to generate the distributions seen in <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. For assessing behavioral phenotype penetrance, we used thresholds that required turning rates for experimental data to be beyond the 97.7th percentile of control data and walking velocity to be outside of the 2.3rd percentile (negative values, backward walking) or the 97.7th percentile (positive values, forward walking) to be scored as positive. These percentiles roughly correspond to two standard deviations away from the mean in a normal distribution; we use percentiles because the distributions are non-normal. The thresholds were determined independently for the arena and the single-fly assays and are indicated by horizontal red lines in <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. The thresholds were used to convert mean velocities into true/false values for forward walking, backward walking and turning. Jumping and reaching were scored manually. Jumping in the arena assay was defined as events in which a fly\u2019s legs all left the ground, usually accompanied by the initiation of wing flapping and change in fly shape. Jumping in the single-fly assay was defined as a fly leaving the platform due to a sudden leg extension. Reaching in the arena assay was defined as when the fly pitches its body back and reaches with a forward and upward extension of the forelegs, while staying in the same location. Reaching in the single-fly assay was defined as a head-up elevation of the long body axis, with both front legs leaving the platform and at least one leg elevating above a horizontal plane at the level of the dorsal tip of the head. For box plots, the dividing line in the box indicates the median, the boxes contain the inner quartile range, the notches give the 95% confidence interval, the lines extending beyond the box include 95% of the data, and the dots beyond those lines are outliers."

To image from individual lobula columnar cell-types, split-GAL4 driver lines (LC6: OL0070B, LC16: 0L0046B, LC11: OL0015B) were crossed to pJFRC7-20XUAS-IVS-GCaMP6m in <i>VK00005</i> (DL background) effector line. The imaging preparation was almost identical to that described in (<a href=\"#bib87\">Strother et al., 2014</a>). Briefly, flies were cold anesthetized and tethered to a fine wire at the thorax using UV-curing adhesive. The two most anterior legs (T1) were severed and glued down along with the proboscis to prevent grooming of the eyes and to immobilize the head. Tethered flies were glued by the head capsule into the fly holder and after addition of saline to the bath, the cuticle at the back of the head was dissected away to expose the brain. Muscles 1 and 16 were severed to reduce the\u00a0motion of the brain within the head capsule, and the post-ocular air sac on the imaged side was removed to expose the optic glomeruli."

The luminance-matched stimulus was created using the dark looming disk stimulus, spatially scrambling the location of dark pixels of each frame only within the area of the final size of the disk. The time series of looming stimuli sizes were presented based on the classic parameterization for looming stimuli assuming a constant velocity of approach. The speed of the loom is represented by a single parameter (r/v) that describes the ratio of the stimulus radius to its approach speed (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gabbiani et al., 1999</a>).

The fluorescence signal is determined within hand-drawn regions of interest selected to tightly enclose the entire slice of each glomerulus captured within the imaging plane. \u0394F/F is calculated as the ratio of (F \u2212- F<sub>0</sub>) / F<sub>0</sub>, where F is the instantaneous fluorescence signal and F<sub>0</sub> is calculated as the 10th percentile of the fluorescence signal within a sliding 300 frame window. For combining the\u00a0responses of individual flies across animals, we normalized the \u0394F/F responses from each individual fly to the 98th percentile of the \u0394F/F across all visual stimuli within one experiment. All responses are the mean of the mean response (across repeated stimulus presentations) of each of five flies. Error bars indicate mean \u00b1 SEM. All significance results presented for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging were determined with the Mann-Whitney test."

They perform an exhaustive and outstanding anatomical analysis and generate sparse genetic drivers (split Gal4) that will be an invaluable resource for the research community. The behavioral screen of all the lines and the calcium imaging of a select subset provide useful information about the function of these neurons."
