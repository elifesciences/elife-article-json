This \u2018vertical\u2019 process means that, eventually, the entire population can share the same beneficial mutation at the same location in the genome. However, beneficial mutations can also spread \u2018horizontally\u2019 so that they are shared between two (or more) locations in the genome of an individual (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). There are only a few ways that this horizontal movement can happen in animals and other eukaryotes. One way involves genetic parasites\u2014called transposable elements\u2014that \u2018cut\u2019 or \u2018copy\u2019 themselves from one location and then \u2018paste\u2019 themselves elsewhere in the genome. Gene conversion is another mechanism whereby one region of DNA is copied and used to replace a different, but highly similar, stretch of DNA. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Christopher Ellison and Doris Bachtrog\u2014both from the University of California, Berkeley\u2014report that a beneficial mutation has spread via these two mechanisms to multiple sites on the X chromosome of the fruit fly <i>Drosophila miranda</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2015</a>)."

Thus, the most recently formed neo-X chromosome of <i>Drosophila miranda</i> needed to somehow develop sequence motifs that can also recruit this molecular complex."

In fact, the binding motifs of the older X chromosome were also derived from transposable elements, and nature often seems to look to transposable elements when facing similar challenges. A number of studies have shown that transposable elements often serve as sources of ready-to-use binding motifs that can help regulate the expression of networks of genes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Cowley and Oakey, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Sundaram et al., 2014</a>). However, nature does not always get it right first time. Instead, the first attempt can be more of a \u2018quick and dirty\u2019 solution that is subject to further improvement over the course of evolution. Ellison and Bachtrog had previously found that the binding motifs derived from transposable elements on the neo-X chromosome are suboptimal (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2013</a>). This led them to hypothesize that \u2018fine-tuning\u2019 of the process might be going on."

Would the only solution be for this transposable element to copy and paste itself across the neo-X again? In other words, would the entire dosage compensation network have to be rebuilt from scratch each time any copy acquires a better mutation?"

Instead, nature seems to have a far more elegant solution that involves the spread of beneficial mutations via gene conversion. Ellison and Bachtrog identified two mutations in the transposable element that make it better at recruiting the molecular complex that carries out dosage compensation. They then showed that these two mutations are spreading across the different copies of the transposable element-derived regulatory element on the neo-X by gene conversion. Of course, gene conversion can work in both directions; that is to say, the process can spread a mutation or reverse it. However, because the mutations found by Ellison and Bachtrog are beneficial, natural selection tend to favor individuals where the mutation has spread over those where it has been reversed."

First, mutations that are closer together, as is the case with the two mutations identified by Ellison and Bachtrog, can be transferred simultaneously. Second, it allows genetic variation to migrate across multiple sites in the genome, which, in turn, actually makes natural selection more efficient (<a href=\"#bib5\">Mano and Innan, 2008</a>). Third, beneficial mutations present in different copies, or lineages, can be brought together. This may be analogous to the role of sexual recombination, which is considered as one of the major reasons why we have two sexes."

It is likely that the fine-tuning of the dosage compensation system will continue by sharing such mutations across the entire family by gene conversion. It should be interesting to investigate whether such fine-tuning has occurred throughout the evolution of other regulatory networks."
