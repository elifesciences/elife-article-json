                    "text": "The neuronal RNA binding protein NOVA regulates splicing, shuttles to the cytoplasm, and co-localizes with target transcripts in dendrites, suggesting links between splicing and local translation. Here we identified &gt;200 transcripts showing NOVA-dependent changes in abundance, but, surprisingly, HITS-CLIP revealed NOVA binds these RNAs in introns rather than 3\u2032 UTRs. This led us to discover NOVA-regulated splicing of cryptic exons within these introns. These exons triggered nonsense mediated decay (NMD), as UPF1 and protein synthesis were required for NOVA's effect on RNA levels. Their regulation was dynamic and physiologically relevant. The NMD exons were regulated by seizures, which also induced changes in Nova subcellular localization and mediated large changes in synaptic proteins, including proteins implicated in familial epilepsy. Moreover, Nova haploinsufficient mice had spontaneous epilepsy. The data reveal a hidden means of dynamic RNA regulation linking electrical activity to splicing and protein output, and of mediating homeostatic excitation/inhibition balance in neurons."

Here we identified &gt;200 transcripts showing NOVA-dependent changes in abundance, but, surprisingly, HITS-CLIP revealed NOVA binds these RNAs in introns rather than 3\u2032 UTRs. This led us to discover NOVA-regulated splicing of cryptic exons within these introns. These exons triggered nonsense mediated decay (NMD), as UPF1 and protein synthesis were required for NOVA's effect on RNA levels. Their regulation was dynamic and physiologically relevant. The NMD exons were regulated by seizures, which also induced changes in Nova subcellular localization and mediated large changes in synaptic proteins, including proteins implicated in familial epilepsy. Moreover, Nova haploinsufficient mice had spontaneous epilepsy. The data reveal a hidden means of dynamic RNA regulation linking electrical activity to splicing and protein output, and of mediating homeostatic excitation/inhibition balance in neurons."

These codons trigger a process called nonsense-mediated decay that involves identifying mRNA transcripts that contain nonsense mutations, and then degrading them. These cryptic exons were seen in mice missing the NOVA proteins, where they are expressed in abnormally high levels; in normal mice, these exons have not been seen before, hence they were termed \u2018cryptic\u2019."

NOVA crosslinks to many transcripts in both nuclear/intronic and cytoplasmic/3\u2032 UTR clusters, suggesting an ordered set of cis-actions on target RNAs. Surprisingly, however, among 229 transcripts showing significant steady-state changes, NOVA binding was primarily present in intronic rather than cytoplasmic elements. This led us to hypothesize and identify previously unannotated exons or alternative splicing patterns near these intronic elements that introduced premature termination codons (PTC) able to mediate nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Thus HITS-CLIP reveals that NOVA regulates otherwise cryptic NMD exons in the nucleus to indirectly regulate steady-state mRNA levels in the cytoplasm. We put this finding in a physiologic context, showing that these exons encode synaptic proteins, they are regulated by seizure activity, and that Nova itself is important in epilepsy, as the protein shifts from the neuronal nucleus to cytoplasm shortly after seizure, and Nova haploinsufficient mice have spontaneous epilepsy. Together, these data suggest a role for Nova in maintaining homeostasis after seizure, in part through the regulation of cryptic NMD exons."

Consistent with this possibility, we found a nearly 10-fold reduction in <i>Dlg3</i> mRNA in NOVA DKO brain RNA samples by Northern blot analysis using two different probes and semi-quantitative RT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), with intermediate changes seen in single NOVA1 or NOVA2 KO mice (data not shown)."

To assay the functional outcome of NOVA binding to the 3\u2032 UTR elements, we generated a construct encoding a destabilized d1EGFP fused to either a 214 nt fragment (NOVA binding clusters in 3\u2032 UTR shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) from the wild-type <i>Dlg3</i> 3\u2032 UTR or a mutant fragment which would disrupt NOVA binding (YCAY-&gt;YAAY; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). 24 hr after transfection of these constructs into Neuro2a (N2a) neuroblastoma cells, actinomycin D was added for 5 hr in order to block transcription, and <i>Dlg3</i> mRNA levels were followed by qRT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data revealed a relatively small but clear decrease in d1EGFP mRNA containing mutant YAAY NOVA binding sites (\u223c50% reduction) compared to transcripts harboring WT YCAY elements, indicating that NOVA binding to the 3\u2032 UTR had a small effect on <i>Dlg3</i> steady state levels. However, this interaction did not appear to be sufficient to explain the large effect NOVA had on transcript (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and protein levels in neurons, prompting us to examine whether additional NOVA actions on <i>Dlg3</i> intronic elements contributed to effects on steady-state RNA levels."

To explore whether NOVA intronic binding sites might relate to an action on <i>Dlg3</i> steady-state mRNA levels, we empirically searched for cryptic alternative splicing events in regions neighboring the largest intronic HITS-CLIP clusters, given previous observations indicating that NOVA intronic clusters predict alternative splicing outcomes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dredge et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Ule and Darnell, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Licatalosi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>).

In WT mouse brain two isoforms were detected and sequenced, and these were found to correspond to known alternative spliced isoforms, harboring what we refer to as E16, with or without E17, and a trace amount of a larger isoform. Remarkably, RT-PCR analysis of NOVA DKO mouse brain RNA revealed a marked increase of this larger isoform, and the presence of a previously unknown fourth, even larger form. Sequence analysis revealed the latter two isoforms correspond to the inclusion of an exon, E15, just downstream of the main Nova nuclear CLIP cluster, and a new combination of exons undetectable in WT brain, incorporating both E15 and E16 (as well as E17; termed Dlg3.15-16-17). E16 also has a second upstream intronic CLIP cluster, suggesting that the Nova binding sites upstream of E15 and E16 could normally act to suppress their dual inclusion, consistent with their inclusion in the DKO brain and with the Nova position-dependent splicing map (<a href=\"#bib48\">Licatalosi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010</a>)."

First, we added emetine, a translational inhibitor, into primary neuronal cultures of neurons obtained from WT or NOVA DKO mouse brain, since a pioneering round of translation is necessary to activate the NMD pathway (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ni et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schoenberg and Maquat, 2012</a>). After emetine treatment for 10 hr, RNA was isolated and <i>Dlg3</i> splicing was assayed by RT-PCR. In WT neurons, emetine had no effect on <i>Dlg3</i> splicing. However, in the absence of NOVA, emetine induced a dramatic increase in the NMD isoform Dlg3.15-16-17, and total <i>Dlg3</i> mRNA levels increased by 3.5-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This result establishes a link between the ability to detect NOVA-dependent splicing of Dlg3.15-16-17 and active translation, suggesting that this isoform is normally suppressed coordinately both by NOVA and NMD."

We first established that Upf1 siRNA was able to reduce UPF1 protein (by \u223c90%) in N2a cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We then transfected Upf1 siRNA into cultured primary neurons to readdress the possibility of coordinate regulation by NOVA and NMD. In primary neuronal cultures, transfection efficiency was lower, such that only about half of the cells were transfected, and we detected a concomitant \u223c50% decrease in <i>Upf1</i> transcript in qRT-PCR analysis (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Hence to directly assess the effects of <i>Upf1</i> knock-down on a per-cell basis, we transfected <i>Upf1</i> siRNA into WT or DKO primary neuronal cultures, and monitored DLG3 and UPF1 protein levels in individual cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. These experiments revealed a reciprocal relationship between DLG3 protein and UPF1 protein levels in NOVA DKO neurons. DLG3 protein level was very low in untransfected DKO neurons that expressed UPF1 protein (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D and 3C</a>), whereas cells in which UPF1 signals were markedly reduced by <i>Upf1</i> siRNA exhibited a markedly increased DLG3 signal. We interpret these results to indicate that when the NMD pathway was inhibited by Upf1 knock-down, mis-spliced <i>Dlg3.15-16-17</i> mRNA led to accumulation of DLG3 protein that escape NMD degradation and accumulate at the protein level. This may have included truncated isoforms, as these experiments used an antibody against a Dlg3 N-terminal epitope; (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). More generally, these results demonstrate that NOVA regulation of a cryptic alternatively spliced exon is necessary to prevent NMD-mediated suppression of Dlg3 expression in the brain, and this can act in concert with 3\u2032 UTR binding to maintain Dlg3 expression."

Transcripts were then screened for the presence of cryptic NMD exons by RT-PCR using primers in exons bounding the intronic HITS-CLIP clusters. Data is divided into those transcripts down-regulated or up-regulated in Nova DKO, as indicated. Sequence analysis of RT-PCR products showed the presence of cryptic exons harboring premature stop codons (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). A diagram of the loci of each NMD exon present in Figure 5A is shown in <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. For example, most transcripts down-regulated in Nova DKO brains show a larger, PTC containing exon in DKO; one exception is Actl6b, in which in the absence of NOVA there is a PTC, and in WT brain, an upper alternate isoform (exon) is present that corrects that frame-shift; (<b>B</b>) Effect of emetine on putative NOVA-regulated cryptic NMD exons. The steady-state level of six transcripts identified in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B, 4C and 5A</a> were assessed by qRT-PCR in six DIV WT vs Nova DKO primary mouse neurons incubated for 10 hr in the presence or absence of emetine. The results were plotted with the Y-axis as a measure of the degree of putative NOVA-dependent NMD regulation (the fold change of transcript levels in DKO neurons in the presence or absence of emetine, divided by that of WT, in log<sub>2</sub> scale). For example, for <i>Dlg3</i> the log<sub>2</sub> value is about 1.0 indicating that emetine treatment increased the <i>Dlg3</i> NMD-isoform in DKO neurons relative to WT neurons by a factor of two, while emetine decreased the NMD isoform of <i>Scn9a</i> by \u223c1.4-fold, leading to decrease or increase in the respective proteins in Nova DKO neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a> or <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, respectively).

We have previously demonstrated that NOVA shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib67\">Racca et al., 2010</a>), and hence explored the possibility that electrical activity might affect the cellular distribution of the protein. We examined NOVA subcellular localization by immunofluorescence microscopy after sham or pilocarpine induced seizures. We consistently observed marked shifts of NOVA from the neuronal nucleus to the cytoplasm within 2\u20134 hr of pilocarpine-induced seizures, and that persisted in some animals for 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). This finding was evident in cortical neurons, and even more so in the CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, where quantitation revealed over a 6-fold shift in the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic signal intensity at 4 hr after seizure (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Consistent with the cortical nature of epilepsy, we did not see this shift in NOVA localization in Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). These data suggest that there may in part be cell biologic mechanisms whereby pilocarpine affects the ability of NOVA to regulate splicing of some targets, but additional experiments will be required to fully understand their nature and consequences."

Such regulation is generally thought to be mediated by RNA\u2013protein interactions in the 3\u2032 UTR, which may involve interactions with a number of RNA binding proteins. For example, the balance of binding to AU-rich elements by AUF1, BRF1, KSRP, TTP or HuR (<a href=\"#bib56\">Meisner and Filipowicz, 2011</a>), binding to UGUR elements by Pumillio (<a href=\"#bib8\">Crittenden et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Quenault et al., 2011</a>), or interactions between miRNAs and the Ago\u2013RISC complex (<a href=\"#bib42\">Krol et al., 2010</a>) all feed into pathways of deadenylation and mRNA decay. Our finding that transcripts showing NOVA-dependent steady-state regulation did not have NOVA binding sites in the 3\u2032 UTR was therefore unexpected, and might have suggested that these were indirect targets of NOVA action. However, HITS-CLIP provides a powerful means of providing unambiguous and unbiased sites of RNA\u2013protein interaction. Directed analysis of unbiased HITS-CLIP targets can reveal cryptic biology, as in the analysis of developmental HITS-CLIP maps to study NOVA interactions with transcripts of the Reelin pathway and thereby identify a previously unknown NOVA-dependent alternative exon necessary for proper neuronal migration (<a href=\"#bib86\">Yano et al., 2010</a>). Here, we have used the predictive power of HITS-CLIP to identify seemingly irrelevant intronic NOVA binding sites on transcripts showing unexplained NOVA-dependent steady-state changes to predict the presence of cryptic alternative NMD exons."

Such transcripts harbor downstream exon junction complex (EJC) proteins that, due to upstream PTCs, fail to be removed during an initial round of translation, leading to recruitment of NMD components (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schoenberg and Maquat, 2012</a>). Recent studies have extended this view, indicating that NMD can function beyond a quality control mechanism, to serve as a mechanism for regulating gene expression disability (<a href=\"#bib30\">Huang and Wilkinson, 2012</a>). NMD efficiency varies in different tissues, loss-of-function mutations in Upf genes in mice alter expression of a subset of transcripts, and loss-of-function mutations in Upf3b in humans are associated with intellectual disability (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tarpey et al., 2007</a>)."

In addition, alternative splicing-coupled NMD has been shown to regulate expression levels of Arc (<a href=\"#bib22\">Giorgi et al., 2007</a>), PSD95 (<a href=\"#bib91\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>), and spermine acetyltransferase (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hyv\u00f6nen et al., 2006</a>), a process referred to as regulated unproductive splicing and translation (RUST) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lewis et al., 2003</a>). In yeast, a direct role for NMD was statistically inferred in the regulation of hundreds of transcripts involved in chromosomal and telomere maintenance and silencing (<a href=\"#bib26\">Guan et al., 2006</a>). Cancer cells have been shown to utilize NMD, for example via actions on mutant cadherin transcripts (<i>Chd1</i>) that are associated with poor clinical outcome in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. A full understanding of such pathways and means to manipulate them has been challenging because the factors regulating NMD-associated splicing are not generally known. Some well-studied exceptions have provided significant biologic insights, such as the autoregulation of the splicing factor PTBP1 (<a href=\"#bib83\">Wollerton et al., 2004</a>) and its action on the paralogous transcript PTBP2, which mediates skipping of Ptbp2 exon 10, leading to NMD and suppression of neuronal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boutz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Makeyev et al., 2007</a>). Indeed, Makeyev and co-workers have identified PTBP1-dependent retained introns that suppress expression of neuronal transcripts in non-neuronal cells, allowing their expression as PTBP1 is downregulated during neuronal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib87\">Yap et al., 2012</a>). We recently found that PTBP2 is expressed in neuronal progenitors, while NOVA is induced in post-mitotic neurons (<a href=\"#bib86\">Yano et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Licatalosi et al., 2012</a>); regulation of cryptic exon splicing may affect transcript levels in neurons and/or prevent spurious expression of transcripts in non-neural cells. Another point of interest will be to assess whether there is cell-type specific regulation of PTC exons in specific neuronal types within the adult brain in a manner analogous to PTBP1 regulation of expression within different tissues of the body."

Taken together, our data suggest a model in which NOVA regulation maintains a balance of transcript levels through NOVA-dependent alternative splicing coupled NMD and, to a lesser degree, through direct interaction with 3\u2032 UTR binding elements (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

The mechanisms that regulate NOVA are largely unknown, but interestingly, NOVA may be phosphorylated by GSK3 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dredge et al., 2005</a>), which itself is known to be inactivated in response to various extracellular stimuli in the brain, stimulating pathways such as the PI3K/Akt pathway (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hur and Zhou, 2010</a>), which are activated by electrical activity (<a href=\"#bib68\">Richter and Klann, 2009</a>).

Interestingly, NOVA interacts functionally with Rbfox1 (<a href=\"#bib90\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>), and many of the proteins showing large Nova-dependent changes are also involved in synaptic regulation with links to epilepsy were also found to have NOVA-dependent NMD exons regulated after induction of seizures in mice. For example, NOVA regulation of NMD splicing controls the levels of DLG3, one of a family of postsynaptic density proteins, including PSD95, that transduce signals from the NMDA receptor. Increases in both PSD95 (<a href=\"#bib88\">Ying et al., 2004</a>) and DLG3 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Qu et al., 2009</a>) in cortex or post-synaptic fractions, respectively, have been described in brains of patients with focal cortical dysplasia and epilepsy.

Moreover, NOVA control of NMD exons can act to either up or down-regulate protein levels generated from target transcripts, and, more specifically, to act after seizure to restore balance to synaptic proteins that would inhibit further seizure (e.g. increasing SCN9a, which would presumably be anti-epileptic). Hence the normal regulation of NOVA itself may provide an RNA-based means of regulating homeostatic plasticity in the face of electrical stress."

Among transcripts with NOVA 3\u2032 UTR binding we observed a significant number also had intronic NOVA binding, suggesting a possible hierarchy of events in which nuclear binding precedes (and potentially determines) 3\u2032 UTR binding. Such connections were originally suggested from studies in <i>Drosophila</i>, in demonstration of the coupling of the splicing and localization of Oskar mRNA (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hachet and Ephrussi, 2004</a>), and the observation that the predominantly nuclear Hrb27c protein (whose mammalian homologue is the DAZAP1 splicing factor; (<a href=\"#bib23\">Goina et al., 2008</a>)) also binds to and is required for localization of <i>Grk</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#bib24\">Goodrich et al., 2004</a>). In mammalian cells, ZBP1 binds to actin mRNA in the nucleus and subsequently is required for its localization (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Pan et al., 2007</a>), and NOVA binds to transcripts (e.g. GlyR\u03b12) in introns to regulate alternative splicing and is also associated with 3\u2032 UTR and localization of the same mRNA in the neuronal dendrite (<a href=\"#bib67\">Racca et al., 2010</a>)."

For example, intronic NOVA binding to high affinity intronic clusters would allow a high local concentration of the protein upon individual transcripts, potentially allowing rearrangement in cis and binding of additional secondary RNA elements, including those within the 3\u2032 UTR. However, it should be noted that HITS-CLIP provides data that is a population average of many individual RNA\u2013protein interactions, so that such potential cis-actions on a single transcript can only be inferred. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that such local concentration and one-dimensional rearrangements <i>in cis</i> are believed to play an important role in scanning and initiation of transcription (<a href=\"#bib1\">Blainey et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Wang and Greene, 2011</a>), and hence may plausibly act on pre-mRNAs to distribute RNABPs <i>in cis</i> to coordinate different aspects of post-transcriptional regulation. In this context, it is especially notable that NOVA localization changes after seizure, suggesting that the association of NOVA with newly transcribed and spliced transcripts may be coupled in an activity-sensitive manner with their localization and/or translational control."

These were enriched in transcripts encoding synaptic proteins, and their regulation mediated large changes in protein levels (up or down), including proteins implicated in familial epilepsy. The link between NOVA and regulation of excitation/inhibition balance was supported by finding that NOVA haploinsufficient mice had spontaneous epilepsy, and that pilocarpine-induced seizures regulated inclusion of a relatively small number of exons, a subset of which are regulated by Nova. Moreover, Nova redistributes from the nucleus to cytoplasm following pilocarpine seizure, and providing a possible mechanism underlying seizure-associated splicing changes involving Nova-regulated exons. Collectively, our data support a model in which changes in electrical activity affect the distribution of Nova, altering the splicing of cryptic exons that elicit NMD; these changes may provide a homeostatic means of regulating levels of transcripts and proteins associated with epilepsy."

Using microarray profiling they detect \u223c200 genes with increased transcript levels in the brains of wild-type mice compared to brains of <i>Nova1</i>/<i>Nova2</i> double knockout (DKO) mice. A much smaller number of genes show the opposite behavior. Using HITS-CLIP data, the authors examine the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of Nova binding sites in transcripts with differences in steady-state levels. While Nova binding to 3\u2032UTR sequences appears to control the levels of some transcripts, a more widespread mechanism involves Nova binding within intronic sequences adjacent to previously unannotated exons, referred to as \u201coccult exons\u201d by the authors. Nova-dependent suppression or activation of the PTC-introducing exons promotes increased or decreased transcript/protein levels, respectively. The authors further use pilocarpine-induced seizures to investigate how changes in electrical activity might impact Nova-dependent regulation of transcript levels."

Although regulation of transcript levels via alternative splicing coupled to NMD has already been described in several biological contexts, the identification of a coherent network of splicing events subject to this mode of regulation, with potentially important roles in the synapse, is a significant advance. Moreover, the use of HITS-CLIP to identify novel exons that function in regulating transcript levels is a clever application of an already powerful genome-wide approach. The reviewers have several concerns that they would like to see addressed in a revised manuscript."

A possible alternative model for the physiological relevance of the authors' findings is that the Nova-dependent suppression of cryptic exons serves as a mechanism to ensure that specific neuronal transcripts are not spuriously expressed in non-neuronal cells. The authors could readily test this by performing RT-PCR assays on the Nova-regulated transcripts, +/- <i>Upf1</i> knockdown, in non-neural cells. In this context, it is worth noting related work of Makeyev and co-workers (<i>G&amp;D</i> 26, 1209; 2012), who have identified a class of Ptbp1-dependent retained introns that suppress expression of neural transcripts in non-neural cells."

Accordingly, the authors are requested to use qRT-PCR assays over the range of 229 genes predicted to show expression differences to assess false-positive rates. In this context, the descriptor \u201cwidespread\u201d may be overstated."

We supplement this validation of RNA levels by examining Nova-dependent cell biology with a completely new finding that may be impacting Nova's effects on the splicing of some transcripts. Finally, we document the physiologic relevance of the Nova-dependent/activity-dependent splicing and cell distribution changes in aggregate by showing that Nova2 KO and indeed, heterozygous mice, have spontaneous seizures."
