Conventional studies have focused on identifying the residues that have a direct involvement in an enzymatic reaction, but these so-called \u2018catalytic residues\u2019 are embedded in extensive interaction networks. Although fundamental to our understanding of enzyme function, evolution, and engineering, the properties of these networks have yet to be quantitatively and systematically explored. We dissected an interaction network of five residues in the active site of <i>Escherichia coli</i> alkaline phosphatase. Analysis of the complex catalytic interdependence of specific residues identified three energetically independent but structurally interconnected functional units with distinct modes of cooperativity. From an evolutionary perspective, this network is orders of magnitude more probable to arise than a fully cooperative network. From a functional perspective, new catalytic insights emerge. Further, such comprehensive energetic characterization will be necessary to benchmark the algorithms required to rationally engineer highly efficient enzymes."

Conventional studies have focused on identifying the residues that have a direct involvement in an enzymatic reaction, but these so-called \u2018catalytic residues\u2019 are embedded in extensive interaction networks. Although fundamental to our understanding of enzyme function, evolution, and engineering, the properties of these networks have yet to be quantitatively and systematically explored. We dissected an interaction network of five residues in the active site of <i>Escherichia coli</i> alkaline phosphatase. Analysis of the complex catalytic interdependence of specific residues identified three energetically independent but structurally interconnected functional units with distinct modes of cooperativity. From an evolutionary perspective, this network is orders of magnitude more probable to arise than a fully cooperative network. From a functional perspective, new catalytic insights emerge. Further, such comprehensive energetic characterization will be necessary to benchmark the algorithms required to rationally engineer highly efficient enzymes."

As an example, the vastly different assignments of the catalytic contributions of residues in the Ketosteroid Isomerase oxyanion hole, dependent on the type and extent of mutation, provide a particularly clear demonstration of this limitation and underscore the need to clearly and explicitly define the comparison states (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kraut et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Schwans et al., 2011</a>)."

Each residue has a significant effect ranging from 64 to 88,000-fold, with the largest effects coming from R166 mutation and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion removal (E322Y). Previous studies have shown that replacing the E322 side chain with a tyrosine leads to loss of Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the active site (<a href=\"#bib95\">Zalatan et al., 2008</a>). We confirmed this result and showed that the E322Y mutant reaction is not activated by the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding and activation is consistent with the finding that other members of the AP superfamily that lack Mg<sup>2+</sup> have a tyrosine at this position (<a href=\"#bib95\">Zalatan et al., 2008</a>). Indeed, we chose the E322Y mutation for our studies because it gives the same functional effect as E322A while also creating this steric block to Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding (<a href=\"#bib95\">Zalatan et al., 2008</a>). While we did not test all possible mutations, several different mutations were tested at each position and shown to give very similar effects, providing no indication of idiosyncratic effects from any of the subtractive mutations made in this study (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Appendix 1 Table 1</a>)."

The differential effects ranged from 2.6 to &gt;1900-fold, corresponding to differential energetic effects of up to at least 4.5 kcal/mol. Indeed, D153 added back in isolation is deleterious by at least 10-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) but beneficial by 230-fold when added in the otherwise WT background (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

The two monomers of the AP dimer exhibit different active site configurations and are therefore both shown (<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>). (In contrast, the WT AP monomers are remarkably similar, as can be seen by comparing panels <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>.) In both monomers of D101A/D153A AP, P<sub>i</sub> populates two positions that are distinct from its position in WT AP. (<b>A</b>) In one active site of D101A/D153A, R166 is rotated away from the active site. The hydrogen bond distances between R166 and P<sub>i</sub> in WT AP are 2.8 \u00c5 (shown in <b>A</b>). (<b>B</b>) In the other active site of D101A/D153A, R166 partially occupies two positions, one of which faces the active site and hydrogen bonds to one of the partially occupied P<sub>i</sub> ions. The other rotameric position adopted by R166 is flipped away from the active site, and presumably coincides with the other partially occupied P<sub>i</sub> ion, as it would sterically clash with the active-site facing R166 rotamer. Hydrogen bond distances and angles for WT and D101A/D153A AP are listed in <a href=\"#tbl6\">Appendix 2 Table 1</a>."

From a functional perspective, given the close quarters within an active site, even if fully independent functional units were readily obtainable, interconnected units might still be preferable to allow a compact active site that can accommodate the density of groups needed to provide multiple interactions with centrally located substrates and thus optimal catalysis. From an evolutionary perspective, parsimony in natural selection might be expected to lead to multiple uses of the same residue, such that one residue could serve in two functional units, and one functional unit might serve as a foundation or scaffold from which to build other functional units, thereby leading to interconnected functional units. This idea is related to a proposal of Hanson and Rose that natural selection favors the use of the minimal number of acidic and basic residues in active sites, so that such residues tend to be reused when mechanistically reasonable (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hanson and Rose, 1975</a>)."

A model that D101 and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion can each make a catalytic interaction alone that is prevented by a steric block or conformational rearrangement upon addition of the other residue would require fortuitous catalytic interactions present in mutant enzyme forms that are not maintained in WT and is therefore unlikely. A more appealing model is the one in which the two residues have a redundant effect, such that either residue can alone provide a rate advantage through the same mechanism. Given that D51 is a ligand of both the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion that coordinates the nucleophilic oxyanion of S102 (<math id=\"inf2\"><mrow><mi>Z</mi><msubsup><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion could help position the serine oxyanion with respect to the rest of the catalytic apparatus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). D101 is directly upstream of S102 with its side chain anchored to the backbone amide of the S102. Thus, it is possible that either D101 or Mg<sup>2+</sup> interactions can facilitate proper positioning of the S102 oxyanion for nucleophilic attack and that, once either of the two interactions is made, positioning is optimized such that no further functional enhancement occurs upon addition of the second (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

These interconnections presumably position functional groups to make optimal catalytic interactions. As noted above, the functional networks overlap with one another that is, have shared residues (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), and these overlaps may have arisen as evolution co-opted residues within active sites as anchor points for positioning new residues.

However, residues never function in isolation, and essentially every residue in a protein structure can be connected, via chains of hydrogen bonding and packing interactions, to every other residue. In cases of allostery, there are energetic interactions over large distances, and in certain cases the residues and conformations involved in the allosteric transition have been mapped (<a href=\"#bib58\">Monod et al., 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Shulman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cui and Karplus, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">McLaughlin et al., 2012</a>).

Rate enhancements are achieved by lowering the lysine p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> due to its non-polar environment (to increase the concentration of the reactive free amine at neutral pH) and from binding the hydrophobic substrate in this lysine-containing pocket; these mechanisms provide \u223c10<sup>5</sup>-fold catalysis for a designed enzyme, with modest additional rate enhancement obtained through subsequent rounds of selection (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lassila et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hilvert, 2013</a>)."

Although it would not be appropriate to generalize from the single example of AP, our dissection of the AP active site network does show that optimal positioning of catalytic residues can occur with only a subset of the full network; thus, it may be possible to attempt designs with active site modules that correspond to functional units identified in this study and, we hope, subsequent studies. A recent attempt to incorporate an active site catalytic triad produced designed enzymes that, after several rounds of selection, were able to catalyze a side reaction with efficiencies similar to analogous natural enzymes (<a href=\"#bib76\">Rajagopalan et al., 2014</a>). Taking a longer view, the hand-in-hand development and testing of computational approaches, as outlined above (see \u2018Synergy between experimental and computational enzymology\u2019), will ultimately provide foundational models for the efficient design of highly effective and specific new enzymes."

We first consider a simplified model with a single pathway of five successive steps that each lead to increased fitness, each with a one in twenty probability representing a single advantageous residue of the twenty possible residues (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>, top path, black numbers). The probability of achieving the final state for a multi-step process can be considered in terms of a mean waiting time, akin to a reaction's half-time or the inverse of its rate constant (scaled by ln 2). In this case, with five successive irreversible steps each with probability 1/20, the \u2018rate constant\u2019 is 1/100 and the mean wait time is 69 (in arbitrary units; <a href=\"#app3\">Appendix 3</a>). (Calculating probabilistic waiting times using a hidden Markov Model, such as is often used for probability calculations, gives the same relative values as the kinetic mean times [<a href=\"#app3\">Appendix 3</a>].) This kinetic mean wait time is about three orders of magnitude lower than that for the fully cooperative process, which is obtained by computing the mean waiting time: 4.7 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> (=6.8 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> \u00d7 ln 2; <a href=\"#app3\">Appendix 3</a>). Thus, if it were functionally equally probable to obtain an active site with these different underlying energetic properties (i.e., fully cooperative vs stepwise; <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>), evolution would favor the non-cooperative solution by greater than 1000-fold. In other words, for every enzyme that evolved five residues with full functional dependence on one another, there would be more than 1000 with active sites containing residues whose stepwise addition each provided a selective advantage."

To assess the range of possible mean waiting times, we consider two limiting cases (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>, top pathway): i.

In a mathematical sense, more than five variables are needed. Here we develop a minimal mathematical model to account for all 32 AP variants.

For AP mutants with <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>M</sub> values for pNPP hydrolysis that are substantially smaller than that for WT AP and therefore likely are rate-limited by the chemical step instead of substrate association, the ratio of reactivity of pNPP to Me-P (or other alkyl phosphates) is in the range of 1000\u20135000 (<a href=\"#bib74\">Pompliano et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Eisenmesser et al., 2002</a>). (The lower <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>M</sub> value for alkyl phosphates presumably arises in large part due to their lower intrinsic reactivity, which is reflected in their high leaving group p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> relative to pNPP p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> = \u223c16 and 7 for alkyl alcohols and p-nitrophenol, respectively [<a href=\"#bib27\">Evans and Murshudov, 2013</a>].) We therefore determined <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>M</sub> values for Me-P hydrolysis for several of the faster reacting mutants used in this study in addition to the <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>M</sub> values for pNPP, and we calculated the ratio of pNPP to Me-P reactivity (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Eisenmesser et al., 2005</a>). The similar values of these ratios for all AP variants other than WT strongly suggest that the chemical step is rate limiting or nearly rate limiting in all cases. The small variations of the ratios could represent experimental error, small idiosyncrasies of individual mutants, or a not-quite fully rate-limiting chemical step for the mutants with the smaller ratios (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). These small differences, if present in the chemical step, would not affect any of the conclusions drawn herein. In principle we could have used Me-P for all of the comparisons instead of pNPP and a correction for WT (see below), but the faster intrinsic reactivity of pNPP has allowed us to measure AP mutants that are over a billion-fold slower than WT and will allow future comparisons with considerably less reactive AP substrates (<a href=\"#bib54\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>)."

To accomplish this we used the procedure of O'Brien et al. (<a href=\"#bib24\">Eisenmesser et al., 2002</a>), assuming that the ratio of the barrier height for the chemical step for Me-P vs pNPP is the same for WT AP as it is for R166S AP, a reasonable assumption given the similarity of this ratio for a range of mutants and the observation that R166 interacts with the non-bridging phosphoryl oxygen atoms that are common in the two substrates and does not interact with the leaving groups, which are different. The ratio of <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>M</sub> values for Me-P hydrolysis and pNPP hydrolysis for R166S (1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>/57 M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> = 1800) was multiplied with the Me-P activity measured for WT (3.5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>) to give the estimated <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>M</sub> value for pNPP hydrolysis by WT AP of 6.3 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Eisenmesser et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2005</a><a href=\"#bib25\">).</a>"

The density corresponding to the ligand in D101A/D153A AP was best fit by two partially occupied P<sub>i</sub> ions in positions distinct from the position in WT AP. Due to the spread of the electron density from the P<sub>i</sub> ion and the lower resolution of the D101A/D153A model (2.5 \u00c5 compared to 1.2 \u00c5 for WT AP), the reported distances and angles for this structure are subject to greater coordinate error than those measured for WT AP."

The detailed findings and their interpretation will interest the specialist, but the larger picture will interest a broader readership. Not surprisingly, the results support an evolutionary strategy of \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d that involves functional units, or overlapping groups of amino acid residues, but avoids requiring that extremely high levels of cooperativity spring into existence."

Given the structural characterization and amenability of the system to extensive mutagenesis and kinetic analysis, AP is a perfect model system for this study.

Measurements of <i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub><i>/K</i><sub>M</sub> in these mutants have allowed authors to determine if the catalytic effects of any of these residues individually are dependent on the context of any of the other four."

The conclusions are based on elegantly designed, very clean experiments where the side chain of interest is added into the WT or the minimal background, and effect of <i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub><i>/K</i><sub>M</sub> measured. While, for example, the catalytic effectiveness of R166 is enhanced by D101 and D153, it is unaffected by the presence or absence of K328 and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These experiments led to a conclusion that D101/R166/D153 form a functional unit, which is supported by the observed distortion and flipping away of the guanidine group in X-ray structures of previously published D153G and newly acquired D101A/D153A AP, while the positioning of Arg in the structure of E322Y AP is the same as in the WT. Similarly, D153/ Mg<sup>2+</sup>/K328 form a functional unit, and so do D101/Mg<sup>2+</sup>. While all three functional subunits are uncoupled in terms of free energy, they are interconnected as they share residues in common. The authors speculate that such arrangement is preferred, given the limited space in the active site. Additionally, they postulate that multiple uses of a same residue is, evolutionarily, a more feasible scenario."

The article begins with the statement that the establishment of functional connected catalytic units within an enzyme's active site has not been previously accomplished. That may be true for alkaline phosphatase but as a general statement it is false. Studies on triose phosphate isomerase, ribonuclease, and dihydrofolate reductase have established the presence of a coupled network of catalytic residues both within and outside the catalytic site that would qualify under the author's definition as interconnected catalytic units. Modern computational methods when combined with experimental data provide for powerful insights because the entire enzyme can be taken into consideration. Small individual units are often found embedded in larger secondary protein elements with the latter being the \u201cunit\u201d. Finally, the conclusion that the evaluation of the five residues subject to mutation arrived evolutionarily in a stepwise rather than a cooperative process is widely anticipated based on numerous literature articles."

The authors speculate that the functional link is mediated by one of the Zn ions in the active site as well as the Ser102, a nucleophile in the hydrolysis reaction and a residue directly adjacent to D101, and that the anti-cooperativity stems from redundant effects in positioning the serine oxyanion. An alternative explanation is that both D101 and Mg<sup>2+</sup> may function redundantly not to position the serine nucleophile, but rather to enhance electrophilicity of the phosphorus atom (and thus rate of Ser addition) by pulling electron density away through interactions with the phosphoryl oxygen atoms. In this model, D101 would do so through the guanidine group of Arginine, while the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> is water mediated.

The article begins with the statement that the establishment of functional connected catalytic units within an enzyme's active site has not been previously accomplished. That may be true for alkaline phosphatase but as a general statement it is false. Studies on triose phosphate isomerase, ribonuclease, and dihydrofolate reductase have established the presence of a coupled network of catalytic residues both within and outside the catalytic site that would qualify under the author's definition as interconnected catalytic units</i>."

The prior results make two general important points that are now described in the manuscript (along with the pertinent references): 1) There are energetic interactions between active site residues (e.g., the effects of mutations in DHFR on the \u2018top\u2019 and \u2018bottom\u2019 of the substrate binding pocket); and 2) There are many examples of long-range effects and long-range coupling between residues in enzymes (e.g., this, most simply, arises in all cases of allostery). By contrast, by examining the full set of mutant combinations, our study delineates a full set of interaction free energies and is able to define functional units among structurally connected active site residues."

The extent of reduction is a result of the selective advantage that is conferred, but many factors contribute in addition to the protein\u2019s activity (e.g., the degree to which this activity is limiting for survival, the degree of increase in population size, the relationship between population size and survival and reproduction) Because of this complexity, we simplified the model and assumed a reversion probability of zero, to render the effects most transparent and easiest to interpret.
