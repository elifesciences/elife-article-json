Although this is likely to represent an evolutionary ancient developmental process, the regulatory architecture of n\u03b2-catenin-induced mesendoderm remains elusive in the majority of animals. Here, we show that, in ascidian embryos, three n\u03b2-catenin transcriptional targets, <i>Foxa.a, Foxd</i> and <i>Fgf9/16/</i>20, are each required for the correct initiation of both the mesoderm and endoderm gene regulatory networks. Conversely, these three factors are sufficient, in combination, to produce a mesendoderm ground state that can be further programmed into mesoderm or endoderm lineages. Importantly, we show that the combinatorial activity of these three factors is sufficient to reprogramme developing ectoderm cells to mesendoderm. We conclude that in ascidian embryos, the transient mesendoderm regulatory state is defined by co-expression of <i>Foxa.a, Foxd</i> and <i>Fgf9/16/</i>20."

                        "text": "The mesoderm, endoderm and ectoderm arise during embryonic development by a process termed germ layer segregation. In many species, at least part of the endoderm and mesoderm derive from transient \u2018mesendoderm\u2019 precursors, as is the case in ascidian embryos (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kimelman and Griffin, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rodaway and Patient, 2001</a>). However, the precise nature of this induced regulatory state is not well understood. In ascidians, the first animal-vegetal (A-V) oriented cell division generates the eight-cell stage embryo and segregates the mesendoderm and some neural lineages into two pairs of vegetal founder lineages (the A- and B-line) and the ectoderm (epidermis and neural) into two pairs of animal lineages (a- and b-line) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Conklin, 1905</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nishida, 1987</a>). This study focuses on the A-line mesendoderm lineages. From the 8- to 16-cell stage, the two A4.1 blastomeres divide medio-laterally to generate the two pairs of neuro-mesendodermal NNE cells, for <span class=\"underline\">n</span>otochord/<span class=\"underline\">n</span>eural/<span class=\"underline\">e</span>ndoderm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). NNE cells then divide along the A-V axis to generate NN cells (notochord/neural) and E cells (mostly\u00a0endoderm)\u00a0at the 32-cell stage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Subsequently, NN cells segregate into notochord and neural lineages at the 64-cell stage. At this stage, while the medial E cell generates two endoderm precursors, the lateral-most E cell is subject to an inductive interaction resulting in the generation of one endoderm and one mesoderm (the trunk lateral cell lineage) precursor (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shi and Levine, 2008</a>). Later, during neural plate patterning, a muscle precursor is also generated from the lateral borders of the NN-lineage-derived neural plate (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nicol and Meinertzhagen, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nishida, 1987</a>). Thus, as in other species, ascidian germ layer segregation can be viewed as a progressive process with part of the neural tissue arising from bipotential neuro-mesodermal progenitors (<a href=\"#bib15\">Henrique et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</a>). The earliest cell divisions of the ascidian embryo along the A-V axis at the 8- and 32-cell stages can be considered as the earliest steps of germ layer segregation."

                        "text": "\u03b2-catenin is a transcriptional co-activator which acts in a complex with TCF DNA-binding proteins to mediate the canonical Wnt signalling pathway (<a href=\"#bib68\">Valenta et al., 2012</a>). The \u03b2-catenin/TCF complex promotes endoderm or mesendoderm in a wide range of organisms, and this process is therefore likely to represent an ancestral mechanism (<a href=\"#bib8\">Darras et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Henry et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hudson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Imai et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Logan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">McCauley et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Miyawaki et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Momose and Houliston, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Wikramanayake et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib70\">2003</a>). We have previously shown that the earliest steps of germ layer segregation in ascidian embryos are\u00a0mediated by two rounds of nuclear(n)-\u03b2\u2212catenin-dependent binary fate decisions. The first n\u03b2-catenin-driven binary fate decision takes place at the 8-\u00a0to\u00a016-cell stage. During this process, the \u03b2-catenin/TCF complex is differentially activated between mesendoderm and ectoderm progenitors, resulting in segregation of these lineages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hudson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Oda-Ishii et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Rothb\u00e4cher et al., 2007</a>). The second step takes place at the 32-cell stage and controls the segregation of NNE mesendoderm cells into endoderm (E cell) and notochord/neural (NN cell) lineages (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hudson et al., 2013</a>). During this step, the \u03b2-catenin/TCF complex is again differentially activated between E and NN cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Therefore, cells in which n\u03b2-catenin remains active during the two steps (ON + ON) are specified as endoderm lineage, cells in which n\u03b2-catenin remains inactive during the two steps (OFF + OFF) are specified as ectoderm lineage and cells in which n\u03b2-catenin is active during the first step but inactive during the second step (ON + OFF) are specified as notochord-neural lineage (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hudson et al., 2013</a>). These two rounds of n\u03b2-catenin-driven switches result in transcriptional activation of the lineage specifiers, <i>Zic-related.b (Zic-r.b</i>, formally <i>ZicL</i>) and <i>Lhx3/4</i> (formally <i>Lhx3</i>), in NN and E cells, respectively (<a href=\"#bib26\">Imai et al., 2002c</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Satou et al., 2001</a>). One of the key features of these reiterative n\u03b2-catenin-driven binary fate decisions is that the same asymmetric cue (n\u03b2-catenin) is interpreted differently during each step (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bertrand and Hobert, 2010</a>). Thus, in the NNE lineage, it is likely that the transient regulatory state induced by the first n\u03b2-catenin input in NNE cells confers a distinct transcriptional response to the second n\u03b2-catenin input on E cells."

Consistent with a recent study (<a href=\"#bib49\">Oda-Ishii et al., 2016</a>), we confirmed that in \u03b2-catenin\u2013inhibited (\u03b2-catenin-MO injected) embryos analysed at the 16-cell stage, <i>Foxd</i> and <i>Fgf/9/16/20</i> expression was lost (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). In addition to the mesendoderm lineages, <i>Foxa.a</i> is also expressed in the a-line anterior ectoderm lineages in a n\u03b2-catenin-independent fashion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b,c</a>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lamy et al., 2006</a>). In \u03b2-catenin\u2013inhibited embryos, <i>Foxa.a</i> expression persisted in NNE and a-lineage cells, probably due to transformation of vegetal cells into animal cells that has been reported previously (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Imai et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Oda-Ishii et al., 2016</a>). Conversely, ectopic stabilisation of n\u03b2-catenin resulted in activation of all three genes in ectoderm lineages at the 16-cell stage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). This was achieved by treating embryos with BIO, a chemical inhibitor of the upstream inhibitory regulator of \u03b2-catenin, GSK-3, from the eight-cell stage (<a href=\"#bib40\">Meijer et al., 2003</a>). Thus, our results confirm that <i>Foxd, Foxa.a</i> and <i>Fgf9/16/20</i> are transcriptional targets of n\u03b2-catenin in vegetal cells, although <i>Foxa.a</i> also has a n\u03b2-catenin-independent expression in a-line animal cells."

Consistent with this idea, <i>Foxa.a</i> has been shown to be required for both NN lineage and endoderm gene expression (<a href=\"#bib23\">Imai et al., 2006</a>), with <i>Foxd</i> specifically required for NN lineage, but not endoderm fates, and <i>Fgf9/16/20</i> contributing to notochord induction from the NN lineage (<a href=\"#bib24\">Imai et al., 2002a</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2002b</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yasuo and Hudson, 2007</a>). However, we found that inhibiting any one of these factors prevented the correct initiation of gene expression in both NN (<i>Zic-r.b</i>) and E (<i>Lhx3/4</i>) lineages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We inhibited these factors using Morpholino anti-sense oligonucleotides (<i>Foxd-MO, Foxa.a-MO, Fgf9-MO</i>) and analysed <i>Zic-r.b</i> and <i>Lhx3/4</i> expression at the 32-cell stage, when NN and E cell lineages become segregated. FGF signals are frequently mediated by the MEK/ERK signalling pathway, leading to transcriptional activation via ETS family transcription factors, as is the case in ascidian embryos (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bertrand et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kim and Nishida, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Miya and Nishida, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yasuo and Hudson, 2007</a>). We confirmed that Fgf9/16/20 is responsible for the broad activation of ERK at the 32-cell stage in most vegetal lineages, including NN and E lineages, as well as two neural lineages in the ectoderm (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1f</a>). Treatment of embryos from the 16-cell stage with the MEK inhibitor U0126, also inhibits this ERK1/2 activation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim and Nishida, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Picco et al., 2007</a>). Inhibition of Fgf9/16/20, MEK or ETS1/2 (ETS1/2-MO) gave similar results, although inhibition of ETS1/2 gave only a weak down-regulation of <i>Zic-r.b</i> expression at the 32-cell stage, perhaps indicating the involvement of additional transcription factors that are also known to mediate FGF signals in <i>Ciona</i> embryos (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bertrand et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Gainous et al., 2015</a>).

Indeed, co-expression of these three factors takes place only in mesendoderm lineages, the NNE and B-line mesendoderm lineages of the 16- and 32-cell stage embryo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). At the 32-cell stage, the E cells continue to express these three genes, while NN cells express only <i>Foxa.a</i> and <i>Fgf9/16/20</i>. However, we have previously shown that <i>Foxd</i> transcripts preferentially segregate into the NN cells during the NN-E cell division, before they rapidly disappear (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hudson et al., 2013</a>). Thus, NN cells also contain <i>Foxd</i> transcripts early in their cell cycle. We conclude that <i>Foxa.a, Foxd</i> and <i>Fgf9/16/20</i> are co-expressed only in mesendoderm lineages. We next addressed whether these three factors were sufficient to induce a mesendoderm regulatory state."

Thus, a6.5 cells possess two of the three mesendoderm lineage specifiers and yet they do not adopt an NNE-like lineage. Consistent with the notion that coexpression of <i>Foxa.a, Foxd</i> and <i>Fgf9/16/20</i> represents a NNE regulatory state, reintroduction of the remaining factor, <i>Foxd</i>, by mRNA injection, was able to convert a-line cells to a mesendoderm state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Injection of <i>Foxd</i> mRNA resulted in ectopic expression of <i>Zic-r.b</i> in a-line cells at the 32-cell stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Imai et al., 2002c</a>). Similarly, expression of <i>Bra,</i> a marker of notochord precursors, was induced at the 64-cell stage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). The broad ectopic expression of <i>Zic-r.b</i> and <i>Bra</i> in the a-lineage was clearly not restricted to the a6.5 cells. The most likely reason for this was that <i>Foxd</i> mRNA injection led to weak activation of <i>Fgf9/16/20</i> and strong inhibition of <i>Efna.d</i> expression in the ectoderm cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Efna.d is a known antagonist of FGF-signals in <i>Ciona</i> and its inhibition results in widespread activation of ERK1/2 in ectoderm lineages (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ohta and Satou, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Picco et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shi and Levine, 2008</a>). Consistent with this, when <i>Foxd</i> mRNA-injected embryos were treated with U0126, the ectopic expression of <i>Zic-r.b</i> was reduced and <i>Bra</i> expression was completely suppressed, mimicking the effect of MEK inhibition on endogenous <i>Zic-r.b</i> and <i>Bra</i> gene expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Thus, injection of <i>Foxd</i> mRNA is sufficient to convert <i>Foxa.a</i>/ERK1/2-positive a-line cells into mesoderm."

To further test this model, we addressed whether co-expression of <i>Foxa.a, Foxd</i> and <i>Fgf9/16/20</i> was sufficient to rescue mesoderm in \u03b2-catenin-knockdown embryos. \u03b2-catenin-MO injected embryos would express only <i>Foxa.a</i> among the three genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>).

                                "text": "We next addressed whether ectopic expression of <i>Foxd, Foxa.a</i> and <i>Fgf9/16/20</i> was able to reprogramme developing ectoderm to a mesendoderm state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The upstream regulatory sequences of the <i>Fucosyltransferase-like</i> (FT) gene become active in ectoderm cells from the 64-cell stage, when the ectoderm genetic programme is already underway (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and when these cells no longer express <i>Foxa.a</i>, <i>Foxd</i> or <i>Fgf9/16/20</i> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Imai et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pasini et al., 2012</a>). Using FT promoter-driven constructs (<i>pFT&gt;Foxa.a, pFT&gt;Foxd</i> and <i>pFT&gt;Fgf9/16/20</i>), we expressed <i>Foxa.a</i>, <i>Foxd</i> and <i>Fgf9/16/20</i> in different combinations in ectoderm lineages. To simplify the analysis and to rule out the possibility that signals from the vegetal cells may influence the experimental outcome, animal hemispheres of electroporated embryos were isolated by micro-dissection at the eight-cell stage. Isolated explants were cultured until the neurula stage when they were assayed for <i>Bra</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013b</a>). <i>Bra</i> was chosen for this assay for its mesoderm (notochord)-specific expression. We observed a clear combinatorial effect between <i>Foxa.a, Foxd</i> and <i>Fgf9/16/20</i> on the reprogramming of ectoderm to mesoderm, with strong induction of <i>Bra</i> seen only when all three constructs were co-electroporated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). This reprogramming was accompanied by a strong downregulation of ectoderm gene expression and ectopic expression of <i>Zic-r.b</i> in the ectoderm cells of whole embryos (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, ectoderm explants could be reprogrammed to adopt an endoderm state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). To achieve this, ectoderm explants from embryos electroporated with the triple combination (<i>pFT&gt;Foxa.a, pFT&gt;Foxd</i> and <i>pFT&gt;Fgf9/16/20</i>) were treated with a pulse of BIO from the 76-cell stage to mimic the second round of n\u03b2-catenin activation that normally drives the segregation of NN and E lineages (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). The 76-cell stage was chosen, as at this stage ectopic expression driven by the <i>pFT</i> constructs is readily detectable (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>), the ectoderm programme is downregulated (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>) and ectopic <i>Zic-r.b</i> is not yet detected (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). This stage thus represented the best approximation of the NNE state of normal embryos. We confirmed that BIO-treatment was able to induce nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin in isolated explants at the 76-cell stage (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Endoderm induction was assayed by detection of <i>Lhx3/4</i> expression at the mid-gastrula stage, that is approximately 1\u00a0hr after the onset of BIO-treatment. Coupling these three factors with BIO-treatment resulted in strong induction of <i>Lhx3/4</i> expression. We conclude that the combinatorial activity of <i>Foxa.a, Foxd and Fgf9/16/20</i> is sufficient to reprogramme developing ectoderm cells to adopt a mesendoderm state."

While this manuscript has focused on the mesendoderm fates that arise from the NNE lineage, this lineage also produces neural tissue. NNE cells divide into E cells and NN cells. In addition to notochord, the NN cell generates the posterior part of the CNS, including the equivalent of the \u2018spinal cord\u2019 of vertebrates (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib20\">Hudson, 2016</a>]). The binary cell fate decision between neural and notochord takes place at the 64-cell stage (<a href=\"#bib41\">Minokawa et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Picco et al., 2007</a>). The lateral neural progenitors that arise from the NN-cell lineage also produce a muscle cell during neural plate patterning, following another neuromesodermal binary fate decision (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib19\">Hudson and Yasuo, 2008</a>]). Bipotential neuromesoderm progenitors are not an ascidian novelty (<a href=\"#bib15\">Henrique et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</a>). For example, in the zebrafish tailbud, bipotential neuromesodermal progenitor cells generate notochord and floorplate (ventral spinal cord) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Row et al., 2016</a>) and in both human and mouse embryonic stem cells and zebrafish tailbud stem cells, bipotential neuromesodermal progenitors generate paraxial mesoderm and posterior neural tube (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gouti et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Martin and Kimelman, 2012</a>). Even in the classical mesendoderm model, that is the <i>C. elegans</i> EMS cell, the MS (mesoderm) lineage also gives rise to some neurons (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sulston et al., 1983</a>). The lateral E cells of <i>Ciona</i> are also not yet fate-restricted to endoderm fate. At the 64-cell stage of development, the lateral E cell divides into one endoderm and one trunk lateral cell (mesenchyme) precursor, following induction of trunk lateral cell fate (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shi and Levine, 2008</a>). Thus, as in other species, ascidian germ layer segregation is an progressive process (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</a>) and NNE specification should thus be considered as its first step."

Furthermore, we have shown that the combinatorial activity of just three NNE factors is sufficient to reprogramme developing ectoderm cells to a mesendoderm state. The mesendoderm regulatory state in ascidian embryos is similar to the situation in the <i>C. elegans</i> EMS cell in which the MED1/2 GATA factors feed into both E (endoderm) and MS (mesoderm) lineage specification, such that MED1/2 directly activates both MS and E target genes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Broitman-Maduro et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Maduro et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">McGhee, 2013</a>). Similarly, Foxa.a and Foxd can bind to the upstream sequences of both <i>Zic-r.b</i> (NN lineage) and <i>Lhx3/4</i> (E lineage), suggesting that this genetic interaction is direct (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kubo et al., 2010</a>). While there is little doubt that mesendoderm transiently forms during embryogenesis of many animal models, and that both mesoderm and endoderm are induced by similar upstream regulators (\u03b2-catenin in invertebrates, \u03b2-catenin and Nodal in vertebrates), in most cases the transcriptional nature of the mesendoderm state does not appear to be similar to that of ascidians or nematodes. In particular, the existence of mesendoderm lineage specifiers (that is individual factors required for the initiation of both mesoderm and endoderm GRNs) have not been described in the majority of model organisms. For example, in sea urchins and anamniote vertebrates, mesendoderm has been described as a mixed regulatory state with simultaneous activation of mesoderm and endoderm GRNs, prior to the lineage segregation of these fates (<a href=\"#bib52\">Peter and Davidson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rodaway and Patient, 2001</a>). This type of \u2018mixed-lineage\u2019 regulatory architecture is also described in other systems and displays characteristics of multi-lineage priming, whereby the GRNs of two lineages are simultanously activated prior to lineage segregation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Graf and Enver, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nimmo et al., 2015</a>). If this were the scenario for the ascidian mesendoderm regulatory state, one would expect individual NNE factors to be required for, and be able to induce, only one or other of the two subsequent lineages (NN or E), but not both. A \u2018mixed-lineage\u2019 regulatory architecture is therefore not consistent with our data describing the NNE mesendoderm regulatory state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

In sea urchin and sea stars, for example, genes interacting with both mesoderm and endoderm GRNs have been identified (<a href=\"http://sugp.caltech.edu/endomes/\">http://sugp.caltech.edu/endomes/</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davidson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">McCauley et al., 2015</a>). It cannot be ruled out that mesendoderm lineage specifiers, acting upstream of both endoderm and mesoderm GRNs, are more broadly utilised, but are simply difficult to uncover due to the sheer complexity of early embryos and their GRNs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ben-Tabou de-Leon and Davidson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kiecker et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tremblay, 2010</a>). It is also possible that the regulatory architecture of nematode and ascidian mesendoderm resulted from an adaption to a lineage-based mode of development with small numbers of cells, perhaps enabling these rapidly developing embryos to bypass the need for cross-repression and prolonged stabilisations of the endoderm and mesoderm GRNs. In summary, it is not yet clear whether an obligate mesendoderm state (that is a state with mesendoderm lineage specifiers) is present in the majority of bilaterian developmental programmes, although this seems to be the case in nematode and ascidian embryos."

This suggests that \u2013 as shown to be the case for NN by Kobayashi et al., Genesis, 2013 \u2013 the NNE progenitors are primed by expressing early regulators of both the NN and the E fate.

The relationship between \u03b2-catenin and any of the three factors was also not reported at the 16-cell stage in relation to either loss or activation (BIO-treatment) of \u03b2-catenin. It was important to perform this analysis at the 16-cell stage, prior to fate segregation of the mesendoderm lineage into mesoderm and endoderm lineages at the 32-cell stage.

However, we do not agree that the ascidian \u2018neuro-mesendodermal\u2019 cells are likely to be ascidian specific. Rather, a study of the literature reveals common origins for neural and mesoderm in many species and as in many other species, ascidian mesendoderm specification begins with \u03b2-catenin signalling. The ascidian NNE (Neural, Notochord, Endoderm) cell, specified by \u03b2-catenin signals, divides into a neuro-mesoderm (NN) and (mostly) endoderm (E) progenitor. The NN cell generates notochord (mesoderm) and the posterior part of the CNS, including the equivalent of the \u2018spinal cord\u2019 with its ventral cells that are potentially equivalent to the vertebrate floor plate. Formation of these tissues follows a binary cell fate choice between neural and notochord: not neural and epidermis. Similarly, in the zebrafish tailbud, bipotential progenitor cells generate notochord and floorplate (Row et al., 2016, Development); in both human and mouse embryonic stem cells and zebrafish tailbud stem cells, bipotential neuromesodermal progenitors generate paraxial mesoderm and posterior neural tube (Gouti et al., PLOS Biology, 2014; Martin and Kimelman, 2012; Dev. Cell.). Even in the classical mesendodermal model, that is the <i>C. elegans</i> EMS cell, the MS lineage also gives rise to neurons (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977, Developmental Biology; Sulston et al., 1983 Developmental Biology). Further, several mutations in mice result in fate changes between neural and mesoderm- <i>Fgfr1</i> mutant cells fail to pass through the primitive streak and form secondary neural tubes instead of mesoderm (Ciruna et al., 1997, Development); in Wnt-3a mutants, cells ingress through the primitive streak, but fail to form somites, instead forming secondary neural tubes (Yoshikawa et al., 1997, Developmental Biology); in Tbx6 mutants posterior somites are converted to extra neural tubes (Chapman and Papaioannou, 1998, Nature). While classically the mesoderm germ layer is called as such rather than neuromesoderm, we feel that it is highly likely, due to the widespread nature of the neuro-mesoderm bipotential choice, that some neural fates originates from the so-called the \u2018mesoderm\u2019 germ layer."

Firstly, we see absolutely no reason that a regulator can only be used once rather than for multiple rounds of cell lineage decisions (though this would be more convenient for developmental biologists). Importantly for our study it is the <i>combinatorial activity</i> of these three factors that specifies the NNE state and co-expression of all three factors takes place only at the 16-to-32-cell stages of development in mesendoderm lineages. The on-going expression of these factors in different lineages does not preclude their role in NNE cell specification, but rather suggests pleiotropic requirements. Indeed, in order to unravel the role of NNE factors at the 16-cell stage from their later roles, we focused on the effect of their loss at the 32-cell stage, that is one cell cycle after the onset of NNE factor expression. The 32-cell stage corresponds to the stage when the lineage segregation of notochord-neural (NN) and endoderm (E) takes place. Later stages were also addressed, in part to tie in our data with the published literature. What our data showed was that all three factors were required individually for the correct initiation of <i>both</i> NN and E cell genetic programmes.

However, (initially to our surprise) both NN and E gene expression was reduced if any one of these factors was inhibited. We concluded from this that NNE factors are not indicative of a primed state. In support of this proposition, overexpression of any one factor in developing ectoderm lineages was unable to promote ectopic mesoderm fate, whereas overexpression of all three factors could. This is again not what would be predicted if NNE cells were primed with a mixture of NN and E specifiers: in this case overexpression of individual NNE factors would promote either NN fates (for the NN factors) or E fates (for the E factors). In our system, it is clearly \u03b2-catenin and not cross-antagonism of primed NN and E factors, which generates the differential fate decision between NN and E cells."

A \u2018mixed-lineage\u2019 regulatory state shares characteristics to a primed regulatory state whereby a mixture of cell-type specific genes are transcriptionally activated prior to their restricted expression in a cell-type specific fashion following lineage segregation (e.g. Graf and Enver, 2009, Nature).

We preferred, however, not to call this a \u2018primed\u2019 regulatory state, since in many cases priming involves lows levels of gene activation followed by reinforcement in a lineage specific manner. Instead, we used the term \u2018mixed-lineage regulatory state\u2019 a term previously employed (Guo et al., Dev. Cell, 2010).

Our manuscript now includes a clear definition of a \u2018mixed-lineage regulatory state\u2019 with supporting schematics (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

Thus, one would expect an FGF-independent expression of <i>Zic-r.b</i> at the 64-cell stage, at least in neural fated cells. Consistent with potentially independent gene regulation between the 32- and 64-cell stages, it has been shown that <i>Zic-r.b</i> expression at these stages can be mediated by separate enhancer elements (Anno et al., 2006, Genes Dev. Evol.). In the revised version of our manuscript, we described in more detail the regulation of <i>Zic-r.b</i> and the on-going role of FGF signals during the correct specification of the notochord lineage. While, it is not possible to ascertain whether FGF-signalling is absolutely required at each successive time point, we would nonetheless argue that FGF-signalling via ERK is involved during the step-by-step (<i>Zic-r.b</i> at 32-cell, <i>Bra</i> at 64-cell) specification of notochord."

Thus, while we are confident that Foxd and Fgf9/16/20 are required for the <i>correct specification</i> of endoderm, we also agree that endoderm fate can recover. This kind of recovery is not unusual. In sea urchin for example, in the absence of <i>pmar1</i>, skeletogenic mesenchyme fate recovers as a result of the action of <i>blimp1</i>, a process coined \u2018regulative recovery\u2019 (Smith and Davidson, 2009; PNAS). To use an ascidian example, the loss of Fgf9/16/20 results in an early loss of the notochord genetic programme. However, notochord cells later recover to some extent via the action of Fgf8/17/18 (Yasuo and Hudson, 2007). To turn the argument around, we would not argue from this that Fgf9/16/20 is <i>not</i> required for notochord formation, it clearly is required for notochord cells to follow their correct developmental programme. In the current study, the data showing that loss of Foxd and Fgf9/16/20 in combination leads to a strong loss of endoderm supports a level of 'redundancy' between these two factors, but also a requirement. While we do not find the recovery of endoderm particularly worrying for our model, we do understand the reviewer\u2019s concern. We have now been more careful to highlight our observation that the NNE factors are required for the correct initiation of NN and E lineages, with some recovery during later development.

The specific aim of our study was to identify the mesendoderm lineage specifiers of the ascidian embryo and reveal how they influence the outcome of the second \u03b2-catenin driven binary fate decision that segregates the NN and E lineages. We concluded that ascidian mesendoderm bears most similarity to that in the <i>C.elegans</i> model and is not based on a mixed-lineage regulatory architecture. To date, to our knowledge, no mesendoderm lineage specifiers (that is individual factors at the top of the genetic hierarchy that are required for initiation of both mesoderm <span class=\"underline\">and</span> endoderm GRNs) have been identified in other systems, other than the inducers (\u03b2-catenin and Nodal) themselves. However, the reviewer is correct to say that the published literature does not exclude the existence such mesendoderm specifiers upstream of both mesoderm and endoderm GRNs in sea urchins and vertebrates. It may simply be that regulative recovery/redundancy, together with extremely complicated early development and GRNs make the discovery of these kinds of factors very difficult. Or it may be that ascidians (and nematodes) do indeed use a fundamentally distinct mode of mesendoderm specification due to the simplification and rapidity of their early development. In the revised version of our manuscript, we attempt to address all of these issues in more detail."
