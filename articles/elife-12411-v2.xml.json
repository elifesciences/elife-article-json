Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Arf-GEFs) regulate virtually all traffic through the Golgi by activating Arf GTPase trafficking pathways. The Golgi Arf-GEFs contain multiple autoregulatory domains, but the precise mechanisms underlying their function remain largely undefined. We report a crystal structure revealing that the N-terminal DCB and HUS regulatory domains of the Arf-GEF Sec7 form a single structural unit. We demonstrate that the established role of the N-terminal region in dimerization is not conserved; instead, a C-terminal autoinhibitory domain is responsible for dimerization of Sec7. We find that the DCB/HUS domain amplifies the ability of Sec7 to activate Arf1 on the membrane surface by facilitating membrane insertion of the Arf1 amphipathic helix. This enhancing function of the Sec7 N-terminal domains is consistent with the high rate of Arf1-dependent trafficking to the plasma membrane necessary for maximal cell growth."

Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Arf-GEFs) regulate virtually all traffic through the Golgi by activating Arf GTPase trafficking pathways. The Golgi Arf-GEFs contain multiple autoregulatory domains, but the precise mechanisms underlying their function remain largely undefined. We report a crystal structure revealing that the N-terminal DCB and HUS regulatory domains of the Arf-GEF Sec7 form a single structural unit. We demonstrate that the established role of the N-terminal region in dimerization is not conserved; instead, a C-terminal autoinhibitory domain is responsible for dimerization of Sec7. We find that the DCB/HUS domain amplifies the ability of Sec7 to activate Arf1 on the membrane surface by facilitating membrane insertion of the Arf1 amphipathic helix. This enhancing function of the Sec7 N-terminal domains is consistent with the high rate of Arf1-dependent trafficking to the plasma membrane necessary for maximal cell growth."

Much of this process is controlled at the <i>trans-</i>Golgi network (TGN), where the final processed forms of proteins are recognized by cargo adaptors and packaged into vesicles for transport to endosomes, lysosomes, and the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guo et al., 2014</a>)."

This catalytic domain, commonly called the Sec7 domain, will be referred to here as the GEF domain for clarity. Conserved domains C-terminal to the GEF domain, termed HDS1-4 (homology downstream of Sec7) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mouratou et al., 2005</a>), act to integrate the signals from several small GTPases, including Arf1 itself, to switch Sec7 from a strongly autoinhibited to a strongly autoactivated form (<a href=\"#bib29\">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Richardson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Richardson and Fromme, 2012</a>). The N-terminal DCB (dimerization and cyclophilin binding) and HUS (homology upstream of Sec7) domains, though conserved in all Golgi Arf-GEFs and essential for Golgi function (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ramaen et al., 2007</a>), remain more of an enigma. Numerous functions have been proposed, including cyclophilin binding, regulated dimerization, Arl1 and Arf1 GTPase binding, and enhancement of GEF activity, but studies are frequently contradictory and fail to assemble into a unified understanding of function (<a href=\"#bib13\">Christis and Munro, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Grebe et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lowery et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mouratou et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ramaen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Richardson et al., 2012</a>)."

We find that dimerization of this N-terminal domain is not conserved and that Sec7 dimerization is primarily mediated by the C-terminal HDS4 domain. We describe a new function of the DCB/HUS regulatory domain: this domain enhances the activation of Arf1 in a manner dependent on both lipids and the N-terminal membrane insertion element of Arf1, implying a role in chaperoning the insertion of Arf1 into the Golgi membrane."

Following correction of the annotated intron (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), a construct comprising residues 1\u2013458 of <i>T. terrestris</i> produced crystals diffracting to 2.6 \u00c5. Using experimental phase determination by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction of selenomethionine-substituted protein, the structure of the DCB and HUS domains was determined with four copies in the asymmetric unit. The best resolved chains in the model lack only unresolved loops and the final ~35 conserved residues of the HUS domain absent from the crystallized construct (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Extensive crystal contacts between chains A and B stabilize them sufficiently to produce excellent electron density; the N-terminal portions of chains C and D, with fewer crystal contacts, were less well resolved and had only enough visible density to be modeled as copies of chains A and B (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">2</a>)."

In most species, a poorly conserved ~100 amino acid linker connects the conserved DCB and HUS domains. In the <i>T. terrestris</i> DCB/HUS domain structure, residues 245\u2013271 of this interdomain region (between helices 8 and 10, including helix 9) are resolved in their packing against the armadillo repeat, and the remaining 46 and 21 residue stretches are unresolved in the structure. Interestingly, the mutation E209K in human BIG2 associated with neuronal disease (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sheen et al., 2004</a>) maps to this unresolved region.

However, the fact that the construct dimerizes via the end of a DCB/HUS domain construct that was truncated raised concern, as truncation of helical domains has been shown in the past to result in artificial dimer interfaces (<a href=\"#bib46\">Richardson et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, we purified a longer <i>T. terrestris</i> Sec7 construct comprising the entire DCB/HUS domain (residues 1\u2013492), for analysis by SAXS. While slight divergence is seen, the intact <i>T. terrestris</i> DCB/HUS domain SAXS data closely fits that predicted from a monomer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This strongly suggests that the observed dimerization interface is an artifact resulting from truncation of the C-terminal helix of the HUS domain, although it is possible that this dimerization mode represents a regulated conformation of the N-terminus."

When present, the HDS1 domain likely masks a site by which the DCB/HUS domain dimerizes in its absence, but Sec7 retains its dimerization via the HDS4 domain. Whether this masked dimerization is an artifact or serves a regulatory purpose remains unknown, but the presence of an exposed interaction domain in truncated constructs provides an attractive explanation for the complicated oligomerization results seen in prior work (<a href=\"#bib21\">Grebe et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ramaen et al., 2007</a>), as well as for the seemingly absolute requirement of the DCB/HUS domain for soluble expression of most constructs containing HDS domains. Unfortunately, this latter phenomenon also precludes more thorough biochemical testing of this hypothesis, leaving this model partially speculative. It is also evident from the behavior of the <i>T. terrestris</i> constructs that dimerization of the DCB/HUS domain is not a conserved behavior.

We sought to investigate the mechanism for this enhancement on the basis of the DCB/HUS crystal structure.

Extending our previous results, we were surprised to observe that when we removed membranes from the reaction and truncated the N-terminal membrane insertion helix of Arf1 to preserve its ability to exchange nucleotide (\u0394N17Arf1), the DCB/HUS domain of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Sec7 no longer stimulated GEF activity. Indeed, the Sec7\u0394C construct was slightly less active than the GEF domain alone, possibly due to a reduced rate of diffusion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>).

In the presence of these micelles, the activity of both constructs on myristoylated Arf1 was higher, indicating an increase in the intrinsic rate of nucleotide exchange, yet the Sec7\u0394C construct was again more active than the isolated GEF domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). As this effect is not seen on \u0394N17Arf1 in the presence of micelles, which displays a uniformly reduced rate of exchange, it cannot be attributed merely to the lipids themselves. In a separate experiment we introduced the L8K mutation into the membrane insertion helix of Arf1, which reduces its hydrophobicity and enables Arf1 activation in the absence of membranes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Luo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Yoon et al., 2004</a>). We observed that the DCB/HUS domain did not stimulate activity of the GEF domain towards L8K-Arf1 in either the absence or presence of membranes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that GEF stimulation by the DCB/HUS domain involves insertion of the Arf1 amphipathic helix into a hydrophobic and presumably lipidic environment, yet this effect is indifferent to the precise nature of the lipids."

We investigated whether alanine or aspartate substitutions in these conserved surface residues resulted in cellular viability phenotypes at elevated temperature in a sensitized strain in which the levels of Arf1/2 have been knocked down by 90% through disruption of the <i>ARF1</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib49\">Stearns et al., 1990</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The established <i>sec7-1</i> temperature sensitive mutation (S402L in <i>S. cerevisiae)</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Novick et al., 1980</a>) maps to a conserved serine at residue 158 in the \u03b17\u20138 loop. As this serine sidechain provides helix-capping interactions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the leucine substitution arising from the <i>sec7-1</i> mutation likely perturbs the local structure of this region critical to forming the DCB/HUS interface. Several other mutants displayed temperature-sensitive growth phenotypes; the most significant growth defects were caused by mutations in residues located on a conserved surface of helices 4, 6, and 8, on the opposite side of the protein from the conserved positively charged patch (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>)."

The use of the Sec7\u0394C truncation enabled us to directly monitor the role of the DCB/HUS domain without confounding affects from the C-terminal HDS1-4 domains. While several mutants could not be purified, including <i>sec7-1</i>, a sufficient number representing both conserved regions were purified to allow us to test the involvement of each region in the DCB/HUS stimulatory activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). We found that mutations on the surfaces of helices 4 and 6 (<i>S. cerevisiae</i> residues 297\u2013305 and 364\u2013368) reduced both cell viability and membrane-dependent GEF activity of Sec7\u0394C, whereas mutations in the positively charged patch (i.e., <i>S. cerevisiae</i> residues Arg505 and Lys513) had little effect in vitro despite modestly affecting growth. None of the tested mutations reduced GEF activity in the absence of membranes (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating the mutations that reduce membrane-proximal GEF activity do not simply cause misfolding of these contructs. Therefore, the surfaces of helices 4 and 6 are important for both GEF activity and cell viability."

The strength of the DCB/HUS Arl1 interaction appears to differ among Sec7 orthologs from different species; although Arl1 is clearly important for BIG1/2 localization in fly and human cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Christis and Munro, 2012</a>), it is dispensable for Sec7 localization in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Setty et al., 2004</a>) and is not required for Sec7 function in all fly tissues (<a href=\"#bib51\">Torres et al., 2014</a>).

One speculative model consistent with all observations is presented in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>. A consequence of Arf1 acting to protect its own hydrophobic membrane insertion moiety tightly coupled with nucleotide state is that the nucleotide exchange transition state may briefly expose the Arf1\u2009N-terminal myristoylated amphipathic helix to aqueous solution before its insertion into the membrane. Exchange of nucleotide by the Sec7 GEF domain may position the flexibly linked DCB/HUS domain appropriately for stabilization of this transition state, either via direct transient binding to the amphipathic helix or via positioning Arf1 optimally relative to the adjacent membrane surface."

Interactions between the DCB/HUS and HDS domains may provide a mechanism for autoinhibition by occlusion of the GEF domain in a closed conformation. The absence of the HDS domains in a truncated construct would expose an unstable interaction region in the DCB/HUS domain that becomes stabilized by dimerization. Dimerization of the intact DCB/HUS domain may be an artifact of truncation, but perhaps also corresponds to a <i>bona fide</i> regulatory conformation of the full-length protein induced through interactions with known regulators (<a href=\"#bib29\">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</a>). Our observations that the HDS4 domain mediates both dimerization and autoinhibition imply that Sec7 dimerization is indeed a means of regulation. In the absence of separation of function mutants, it is currently not possible to determine whether dimerization or autoinhibition is the more important function of the HDS4 domain, or whether these two functions are intimately coupled and therefore inseparable. Interestingly, a recent study reported that dimerization of human GBF1, which lacks an HDS4 domain, is not required for its function in cultured cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bhatt et al., 2015</a>)."

To a final reaction volume of 150 \u03bcl, HKM buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM KOAc, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), 200 \u03bcM lipids (lipsomes or micelles), 670 nM Sec7 construct, 670 nM Arf1 construct, and 200 \u03bcM GMPPNP were sequentially added while monitoring fluorescence, waiting 1\u20133 min between steps for the fluorescence to stabilize. After addition of GMPPNP, the fluorescence was monitored for an additional 40 min and fit to a single exponential curve to determine the rate of exchange. In the absence of Sec7, fluorescence traces were observed to remain stable, indicating that the observed changes in fluorescence were solely due to the activity of Sec7, and were not a lipid-mediated effect. The calculated rate of exchange was then normalized to the native fluorescence of the input Sec7 construct to obtain <i>k</i><sub>react</sub>. Note that the per-molecule exchange rates calculated from these reactions are lower than reported previously, in part due to the higher concentrations of GEF constructs used here and variations in behavior between liposome batches. Triplicates of each condition were collected for statistics; error bars represent 95% confidence as determined by t test or ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s or Dunnett\u2019s test in postprocessing, as appropriate."

To convince the reader of this, we now include additional descriptions in the Results and Methods sections. The most important thing to note is that we do directly monitor how the addition of each component changes the fluorescence of the reaction. Notably, exchange rates are extracted from time-course changes in kinetics that only occur subsequent to the addition of GTP, and we include a baseline control (i.e., no GEF construct) in each set of experiments to confirm that no change in fluorescence is seen over time in the absence of exchange (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, black trace). Any contributions to Trp fluorescence from lipids themselves will impact the magnitude of the fluorescence readings, but not the rate at which fluorescence changes over time. The rate of change in fluorescence over time is a direct read-out of Arf conformational change associated with binding to GTP."

The Sec7\u0394C construct (containing the DCB/HUS domain) is much more active than the isolated GEF domain in this assay. The extent of the membrane- binding directly parallels the extent of Arf activation (as monitored by TRP fluorescence) for both GEF constructs, demonstrating that the DCB/HUS domain facilitates both Arf1 activation and stable membrane association (which requires insertion of the N-terminal amphipathic helix).

Furthermore, as the deltaN17-Arf1 substrate lacks the N-terminal helix of Arf1, this helix can be considered to be \u201cpried away\u201d from its binding pocket in this mutant substrate, yet the DCB/HUS domain has no effect on this substrate."

If the DCB/HUS domain stabilizes this transient intermediate state (which we think it does), this state is still likely to be quite transient compared to the time-scale of a pelleting or flotation experiment. We previously performed an experiment similar to that suggested above \u2013 as reported in our 2012 paper (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), Arf1-GDP does not bind stably to membranes in the presence of any Sec7 constructs, including Sec7-deltaC. Our GEF assays are perhaps more informative in this regard, as an increased rate of reaction is suggestive of the stabilization (lower energy) of a high-energy intermediate or transition state."

                    "text": "We note that we propose two alternatives for how the DCB/HUS domain might facilitate Arf1 membrane-proximal activation and insertion of the amphipathic helix: either through direct transient interaction with the Arf1 N-terminus or by positioning Arf1 optimally for membrane insertion (either binding to a different region of Arf1 or otherwise constraining the orientation of the GEF domain in a manner that would position the Arf1 N- terminal helix close to the membrane when Arf1 is engaged by the GEF domain). We think that both of these possibilities are interesting, as either involves function of the DCB/HUS domain to overcome the activation barrier associated with membrane insertion."
