NF-\u03baB, which plays key roles in inflammation and cancer, displays oscillations whose biological advantage remains unclear. Recent work indicated that NF-\u03baB displays sustained oscillations that can be entrained, that is, reach a persistent synchronized state through small periodic perturbations. We show here that for our GFP-p65 knock-in cells NF-\u03baB behaves as a damped oscillator able to synchronize to a variety of periodic external perturbations with no memory. We imposed synchronous dynamics to prove that transcription of NF-\u03baB-controlled genes also oscillates, but mature transcript levels follow three distinct patterns. Two sets of transcripts accumulate fast or slowly, respectively. Another set, comprising chemokine and chemokine receptor mRNAs, oscillates and resets at each new stimulus, with no memory of the past. We propose that TF oscillatory dynamics is a means of segmenting time to provide renewing opportunity windows for decision."

We also indicate the related model parameters resulting from the adimensionalization of the equations of the dynamics and the uncertainty degree, a measure of how uncertain each parameter value is. This is also a measure of how much we allow each parameter to vary in our exploration of the dynamics of the system and in our fittings. Notice that higher uncertainty degrees are assigned to parameters that were manually fitted or to those that are involved in reactions from our models that summarize many different biochemical processes."

NF-\u03baB, which plays key roles in inflammation and cancer, displays oscillations whose biological advantage remains unclear. Recent work indicated that NF-\u03baB displays sustained oscillations that can be entrained, that is, reach a persistent synchronized state through small periodic perturbations. We show here that for our GFP-p65 knock-in cells NF-\u03baB behaves as a damped oscillator able to synchronize to a variety of periodic external perturbations with no memory. We imposed synchronous dynamics to prove that transcription of NF-\u03baB-controlled genes also oscillates, but mature transcript levels follow three distinct patterns. Two sets of transcripts accumulate fast or slowly, respectively. Another set, comprising chemokine and chemokine receptor mRNAs, oscillates and resets at each new stimulus, with no memory of the past. We propose that TF oscillatory dynamics is a means of segmenting time to provide renewing opportunity windows for decision."

This is also a measure of how much we allow each parameter to vary in our exploration of the dynamics of the system and in our fittings.

This behavior is known as oscillation. A transcription factor called NF-\u03baB oscillates, changing between an inactive form outside of the nucleus and an active form inside. NF-\u03baB plays important roles in inflammation and cancer, and is activated by cues from outside the cell. Some of the genes that the active form of NF-\u03baB activates then produce molecules that inactivate NF-\u03baB, thus helping to establish the oscillations."

The growing availability of single-cell measurements is bringing unprecedented insights into the dynamics of transcriptional responses: although it was traditionally thought that gene circuits should provide a temporally stable response to constant external stimuli, there is increasing evidence that the dynamics of gene circuits is more elaborate, and is often characterized by pulses of activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Levine et al., 2013</a>). A special case is oscillatory dynamics, in which the activity of some element in the genetic circuit varies periodically, and so does the output of the circuit. Paradigmatic oscillatory dynamics are associated\u00a0with\u00a0circadian clocks, which are present in a wide variety of organisms that synchronize their activities to the periodic variation in external daylight (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005</a>). However, oscillatory dynamics with periods far shorter than 24\u2009hr have been reported in genetic circuits of bacteria (<a href=\"#bib57\">Suel et al., 2007</a>), yeast (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hao and O'Shea, 2012</a>) and mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hoffmann et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Larson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nelson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shankaran et al., 2009</a>)."

                        "text": "A property of free oscillating systems (or <i>free oscillators</i>, as analogy to simple mechanical oscillators such as the pendulum) is <i>entrainment</i>, by which an oscillator can gradually modulate its phase and frequency thanks to a small perturbation (<i>forcing</i>) that is itself periodic and oscillating with a period resonant with the intrinsic period of the oscillator (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pikovsky et al., 2003</a>). A common forcing can also lead to the\u00a0synchronous dynamics of multiple oscillators and thus to collective dynamical states. Entrainment was successfully reproduced in synthetic genetic oscillators, in which single bacterial cells (each expressing a fluorescent reporter protein in response to a synthetic genetic circuit) were entrained collectively to an oscillating provision of arabinose (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mondragon-Palomino et al., 2011</a>). The forcing to one oscillator can also be provided by other oscillators, and this coupling can lead to the emergence of different collective dynamical states characterized by different synchronous dynamics (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pikovsky et al., 2003</a>). Inter-cellular coupling has indeed been exploited to genetically engineer synchronous quorum sensing genetic oscillators in bacteria (<a href=\"#bib12\">Danino et al., 2010</a>). On the other hand, intra-cellular coupling leads to locked oscillatory states for different cell oscillators, as recently shown for the circadian rhythm and the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bieler et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "In mammalian cells, NF-\u03baB is a typical transcription factor that displays intrinsic oscillatory behavior. NF-\u03baB plays key roles in inflammation, immune responses, development and cancer (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chaturvedi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ghosh and Hayden, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Karin, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ledoux and Perkins, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Naugler and Karin, 2008</a>). Strictly speaking, NF-\u03baB is a family of dimers encoded by 5 different genes, but in what follows we will refer to p65/RELA independently of the dimer it forms. In resting cells, p65 exists mostly within a cytoplasmic complex bound to the I\u03baB inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hoffmann et al., 2002</a>). Inflammatory signals like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induce phosphorylation of I\u03baB proteins by IKKs\u2013upstream kinases in the signaling pathway\u2013, ubiquitination and degradation of I\u03baBs, and the release of active NF-\u03baB that translocates into the nucleus to activate the expression of several genes, including those encoding for the I\u03baB inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hoffmann et al., 2002</a>). Re-expression of I\u03baBs contributes to relocate NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm, which is an inhibitory feedback loop for the system. A second feedback loop is centred on the protein A20 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ashall et al., 2009</a>), which upon activation of the system inhibits the IKKs. Thus, these two layers provide a nonredundant regulation of NF-\u03baB response to external stimuli (<a href=\"#bib66\">Werner et al., 2008</a>). Of note, the I\u03baB inhibitors also show variable sensitivity to different stimuli and respond on different timescales to fine-tune the signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib45\">Paszek et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shih et al., 2009</a>). This system of negative feedback loops (summarized in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> upper panel) provides both a tight control of the response to external stimuli and flexibility. As a consequence of this complex wiring, upon constant stimulation the nuclear concentration of NF-\u03baB in each cell oscillates with heterogeneous dynamics according to each cell\u2019s susceptibility and to the inherent stochasticity of the system (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nelson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tay et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zambrano et al., 2014a</a>). Due to such asynchrony at the single cell level, the NF-\u03baB response appears almost non-oscillating at the cell population level (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hoffmann et al., 2002</a>), and it is difficult to correlate NF-\u03baB oscillatory profiles with gene expression outputs."

White\u2019s group showed that short trains of TNF-\u03b1 pulses produce rounds of synchronous NF-\u03baB translocation; the stimulation frequency affected both the translocation amplitude and gene expression levels (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ashall et al., 2009</a>). A study performed while the present one was in progress indicated that entrainment of NF-\u03baB oscillations at population level arises when 3T3 cells stably transfected with GFP-p65 are perturbed with regular trains of sawtooth-like profiles of TNF-\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</a>). Here, we used GFP-p65 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from knock-in mice and thus expressing physiological levels of p65 (<a href=\"#bib13\">De Lorenzi et al., 2009</a>). Using a microfluidic device, we exposed cells to well-defined, periodic TNF-\u03b1 stimuli, and eliminated continuously both catabolites produced by the cells and secreted proteins, which might generate a secondary autocrine/paracrine response. We find that GFP-p65 MEFs lock their NF-\u03baB oscillations to the periodic external signal, and become synchronized. However, the 1:1 locking is maintained over a wide variety of frequencies of the driving TNF-\u03b1 stimulus, does not improve over repeated stimulation and actually disappears fast when the external stimulus ceases, all of which suggest that entrainment is not achieved. The mathematical model we developed indeed suggests that NF-\u03baB can behave as a damped oscillator, analogous to a mechanical damped harmonic oscillator; damped oscillators do not entrain but follow external forcing while it is present. Taking\u00a0advantage of the fact that GFP-p65 MEFs under periodic stimulation behave as a synchronous population, we analyzed the transcriptional output at genome-wide level. We find that one single NF-\u03baB dynamics translates into 3 different dynamics of transcriptional regulation, all of which can be reproduced by our mathematical model; the key discriminator is the parameter representing mRNA degradation. Furthermore, the three dynamical patterns correspond to specific functions, which suggests that group of genes were positively selected by evolution."

Although this measure implies a partial segmentation of the cytoplasm and thus is more elaborate than the background-corrected mean nuclear intensity used recently by different authors (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sung et al., 2014</a>) it is a ratio of intensities and thus it self-corrects for changes in image intensity in our experimental settings (see e.g. <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> or <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Furthermore, provided that the total amount of p65 is constant (<a href=\"#fig1s10\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 10</a>), NCI(t) is a monotonic function of nuclear NF-\u03baB (<a href=\"#fig1s9\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 9B</a>) so that oscillations are observed in the former if and only if they are present in the latter (further details in Materials and methods).

Indeed, although oscillatory peaks are observed for most of the cells, they are infrequent and irregular for times beyond 6\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>) as previously reported for the same cells in static conditions (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sung et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zambrano et al., 2014a</a>). Hence, we describe here these heterogeneous oscillations as <i>damped</i> in contrast with the <i>sustained</i> oscillations, which continue regularly and unabated for a very long time in continuously stimulated cells, see for example (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</a>)."

The model parameters that we used for our explorations are provided in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>. We denote as P<sub>S</sub> those specifying the external signal and as P<sub>NF-\u03baB</sub> those used to model the double I\u03baB and A20 negative feedback; in our explorations, we allow them to vary differently depending on the associated uncertainty about their values (Materials and methods and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). We generated a library of randomized parameters and found that the system presents a fixed point whose stability changes depending on the parameters (details on the stability analysis are found in the Materials and methods section). The vast majority of parameter combinations give rise to damped oscillations (when all the eigenvalues have all negative real parts, see <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A,B</a>). A smaller fraction of parameter combinations give rise to trajectories that converge to a stable limit cycle around the unstable fixed points (so certain eigenvalues have positive real parts, see <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A,B</a>). Interestingly, parameters for oscillating and non-oscillating cells are in similar intervals suggesting that it is the precise combination of the parameters, rather than a single one, what determines the resulting dynamics (see <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5C</a>). Our simulations might also explain why other researchers found continuous periodic oscillations with T<sub>0</sub> = 90\u2009min under a constant flow of TNF-\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</a>, and see Discussion) and the variety of damped oscillatory dynamics upon LPS recently reported for fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cheng et al., 2015</a>) and macrophages (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sung et al., 2014</a>).

The height of the first peak (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>) is similar to the height of the first peak under constant stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), indicating that the experimental conditions are highly comparable.

The phase plots obtained for TNF-\u03b1 ranging from 10 to 0.1 ng/ml with D<sub>2</sub> =\u00a00 ng/ml show that the coherence of the oscillations decreases with decreasing doses of TNF-\u03b1 but still persists at low doses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). T<sub>exp</sub> is less sharply distributed around 90\u2009min as the forcing amplitude decreases. Concomitantly, a second peak corresponding to multiples of T<sub>f</sub> becomes progressively more conspicuous (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), suggesting that for lower doses of TNF-\u03b1 an increasingly larger fraction of cells do not respond with a peak to some of the forcing cycles. In the plots of peak maxima (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) the height of the first peak is not reproduced by the second and the third peaks, compatible with what reported for this forcing period (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ashall et al., 2009</a>). However the heights converge under repeated forcing to a constant value for all the forcing amplitudes. This is typical of nonlinear dissipative oscillators in the presence of periodic forcing (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goldstein et al., 2001</a>)."

Oscillations are locked to the forcing even for D<sub>1</sub> =0.1\u00a0ng/ml (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1,A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). The use of T<sub>1</sub>=30\u2009min assures the existence of sharp oscillatory and transcription peaks (see below) and also leads to synchrony of the oscillations for T<sub>f</sub>=T<sub>0</sub> (see <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, bottom panels). For all doses we find a bimodal distribution of the oscillation periods, with an overall maximum at 180\u2009min and a much smaller relative maximum at 90\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This indicates that after a single pulse of forcing some cells oscillate a second time with a period similar to the intrinsic one. However, a closer analysis of peak maxima for time intervals of the form [(<i>n\u2013</i>1)T<sub>0</sub>, <i>n</i>T<sub>0</sub>) = [(<i>n\u2013</i>1)T<sub>f</sub>/2, <i>n</i>T<sub>f</sub>/2) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) reveals that peaks arising right after each periodic stimulation (even <i>n</i>) are higher than the rare ones (odd <i>n</i>) arising when stimulation is absent."

We selected T<sub>f</sub>=T<sub>0</sub>/2=45\u2009min, but T<sub>1</sub>=30\u2009min led to a poor synchrony (see <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, top panels). We therefore reduced T<sub>1</sub> to 22.5\u2009min, and thus T<sub>2</sub>=22.5, which proved to be a sufficiently long resetting of the external signal; in these conditions we obtained a sharply defined dynamical response. Oscillations are locked in step with D<sub>1</sub>=10 and 1 ng/ml (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>), whereas synchronization is weaker for D<sub>1</sub>=0.1 ng/ml (this is also evident in the average NCI dynamics, see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1,D\u2013F</a>). The experimentally determined oscillatory period T<sub>exp</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) is narrowly distributed around T<sub>f</sub>=45\u2009min for D<sub>1</sub>=10 ng/ml, but we also find a small peak around T<sub>exp</sub>=90\u2009min, indicating that some cells skip the oscillation elicited by the forcing. The peak height for each forcing cycle tends to stabilize to a constant value and to be lower for lower forcing amplitude, although the differences are small (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Also in this case, the synchrony correlates with the dose: in fact, the phase difference \u0394\u03d5 tends to be more narrowly distributed for higher values of D<sub>1</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), and the synchrony intensity \u03b7 grows with the dose (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>, red line)."

Furthermore, when oscillators are entrained by external forcing, their oscillations also show <i>m:n</i> resonant patterns (<i>m</i> oscillations for each <i>n</i> cycles of the forcing) in so-called Arnold tongues (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pikovsky et al., 2003</a>). However, we only observed 1:1 synchronization patterns for all the periods of forcing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), with no clear evidence of the 2:1 and 1:2 patterns expected for entrainment. We thus investigated further whether the synchronization mechanism we observed does correspond to entrainment."

We then investigated whether our cells kept a memory of the synchronous dynamics once the periodic forcing ceased. The phase plots for 75 cells forced with T<sub>f</sub>=45\u2009min D<sub>1</sub> =10 ng/ml (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, washing out after 16 forcing cycles), and for T<sub>f</sub>=90\u2009min with D<sub>1</sub> =1 ng/ml (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, washing out after eight forcing cycles), indicate that when the external stimulus stops, cells lose quickly their synchrony. This is also evident from single-cell NCI traces and from the peaks detected in the same conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C and D</a> respectively). Indeed, only for T<sub>f</sub>=45\u2009min we observed small peaks after the last cycle of the forcing, but these peaks are on average 90\u2009min away from the last forced peak, and correspond to the intrinsic oscillatory period of our oscillator. The quick loss of synchrony can also be observed in the evolution of the synchrony quantifier \u03b7<sub>n</sub> for the two last cycles of the forcing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, n=1,2) and the two subsequent (virtual) ones (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, n=3,4).

However, we found that our cells can actually be synchronized under periodic stimulations with T<sub>f</sub>=60\u2009min (T<sub>1</sub> =T<sub>2</sub> =30\u2009min) when D<sub>1</sub> =10 ng/ml (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>) and D<sub>2</sub> =0 ng/ml (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, we found that synchrony is still visible for D<sub>2</sub>&gt;0 ng/ml (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>), as we had observed for other stimulation periods. The difference might arise from the fact that we use a forcing different from the sawtooth-like TNF-\u03b1 profile used by <a href=\"#bib24\">Kellogg and Tay (2015)</a>, which is obtained by periodically and quickly replacing the medium in contact with the cells with fresh TNF-\u03b1. The sawtooth concentration profile is assumed to arise due to a clearance process of TNF-\u03b1 by degradation and internalization. We then applied sawtooth forcing to our cells (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Cells lock their oscillations to the sawtooth forcing of periods T<sub>f</sub>=60\u2009min and T<sub>f</sub>=90\u2009min at the doses considered. Interestingly, the synchronization is lost for T<sub>f</sub>=180, suggesting that autocrine-paracrine signalling might introduce a distortion in the cell environment, which is reduced when the medium is changed more frequently. Alternatively, the different geometry of our microfluidic with respect to the one used in <a href=\"#bib24\">Kellogg and Tay (2015)</a> might lead to a slower TNF-\u03b1 degradation and produce profiles closer to static concentration than to oscillatory stimulation. The profiles observed are indeed similar to some of the dynamics observed for alternating doses of TNF-\u03b1 with D<sub>2</sub>&gt;0 ng/ml, such as those for T<sub>f</sub>=60\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>), T<sub>f</sub>=90\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and T<sub>f</sub>=180\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), with compatible values of \u03b7. However, it is clear that with sawtooth forcing of T<sub>f</sub>=60\u2009min the synchrony is strong, at variance with the results reported by <a href=\"#bib24\">Kellogg and Tay (2015)</a>."

Rather, it is similar to that of simple mechanical damped oscillators, such as the damped harmonic oscillator, which after a perturbation tend to relax to an equilibrium state. When these mechanical systems are challenged with an external periodic forcing, the period of the oscillations tends to match the period of the forcing (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pikovsky et al., 2003</a>). In fact, our minimal mathematical model of the NF-\u03baB circuit (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) reproduces damped oscillations (e.g. <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A,B,D</a>). In these conditions, the period of the periodically forced system converges to the period of the forcing (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Of note, the model reproduces the small peaks appearing between two forcing cycles (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), similar to the small peaks that we observed for the same forcing as in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>."

This is probably a desired feature for a system that underlies responses to environmental challenges, which do not come with a particular periodicity. This is the reverse of what might be desirable for circadian clocks, whose design should privilege the entrainment to the 24-hr light/darkness period. To understand how the oscillatory pattern of NF-\u03baB affects its biological output, we focused on the transcription dynamics of genes controlled by NF-\u03baB."

Indeed, the NF-\u03baB network has an equilibrium that depending on the combinations of parameters can be stable, giving rise to damped oscillations that converge to it, or unstable, giving rise to a stable cycle around it (see e.g. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, left, magenta line); transitions between these two states can be mediated by a Hopf bifurcation."

However, whereas mature mRNA oscillates for I\u03baB\u03b1, it slowly accumulates for the late gene Ccl5, and this held true for different frequencies of the periodic stimulation. Genome-wide analysis of dynamics, using unsupervised clustering of whole transcriptome profiles, identified six highly homogeneous sets (\u201cclusters\u201d), three containing genes with increasing transcription and three containing genes with decreasing transcription.

The result is that each new wave of TNF-\u03b1 elicits on Cluster 1 genes almost the same responses as the previous waves, and no memory is kept of the past; the expression of genes of Clusters 2 and 3 allows a long-lasting response that integrates over time the responses to previous waves."

The oscillatory dynamics of NF-\u03baB allows time to be segmented in units of 90 min cycles, with the option to resume chemokine-directed migration after each single cycle. As seen from this perspective, the operation of the NF-\u03baB system as a damped, fast-detuning oscillator implies that in the presence of constant stimulation each motile cell will decide for itself, without synchrony to nearby cells. In contrast, in a situation where stimuli change over time beyond a certain threshold \u2013\u00a0at least three-fold variation in amplitude\u00a0\u2013 cells would be broadly coordinated.

The flexible proprietary software allows the delivery of medium containing different concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 for specific time sequences for more than 10\u2009hr while cell are imaged. The protocols are available upon request. The medium flows in the channels around the microfluidic chambers and diffuses through the perfusion barrier, minimizing the undesirable effect of shear stress (<a href=\"#bib3\">Babini et al., 2015</a>) (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). The small volume of medium in the chambers (less than 1 \u00b5l) is replaced fast even at low pressures, as confirmed by the sharp oscillatory profiles obtained even for high frequency stimuli. In spite of the low pressure applied (1 psi), the flow rates of 10 \u00b5l/hr (manufacturer's website) are in the same order of magnitude as the 200 nl/min used in <a href=\"#bib24\">Kellogg and Tay (2015)</a>. We also generated \u201csawtooth-like\u201d profiles as in <a href=\"#bib24\">Kellogg and Tay (2015)</a> by periodically replacing the medium with a 15 min pulse and stopping the flow. However, the cell-to-medium ratio in our culture chambers might be different and relevant for TNF clearance due to cell-linked decay needed for the sawtooth profile."

As we argue below, thanks to the fact that the total amount of NF-\u03baB is constant (<a href=\"#fig1s10\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 10</a>), NCI depends univocally and monotonically on the nuclear amount of NF-\u03baB. More importantly, due to the fact that it is a ratio of intensities, it is robust and independent of slight changes in the focus and in the laser intensity, among other possible experimental distortions, which are observed in our setup. The same rationale brought us to use ratios of intensities in our previous works (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sung et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zambrano et al., 2014b</a>).

Our quantifier is hence a good indicator of the ratio of the amount of NF-\u03baB in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. However the numerator and denominator of this ratio can fluctuate due to biological reasons and this might blur the existence of oscillations in the nuclear amount of NF-\u03baB. But this is not the case, due to the fact that the total amount of NF-\u03baB is constant for our stimulated fibroblasts. This has been assumed in different mathematical models present in the literature, from the seminal paper (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hoffmann et al., 2002</a>) to more recent papers (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</a>). Interestingly, though, this view has been challenged by the recent work of <a href=\"#bib58\">Sung et al. (2014)</a>,\u00a0which shows that in macrophages under LPS stimulation p65 is regulated by a positive feedback. Thus, to confirm that our assumption is reasonable, we quantified p65 by western blotting for our cells under 10 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 at several timepoints from 1 to 8\u2009hr. The results are shown in (<a href=\"#fig1s10\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 10</a>), showing no significant change in the p65 levels upon stimulation. Hence, we consider our assumption valid.

Notice though that our software discards cells for which the areas change abruptly, which typically is an indicator of imminent mitosis or cell death. We cannot totally exclude variations of p65 at single cell level, provided that we measured it using a population assay; however, p65 turnover is known to be long, so its slow variation would contribute with a small term in the derivative and thus would just slightly distort the times for which peaks in NCI appear compared to those of the nuclear concentration. To conclude, we think that NCI would still capture the peaks and hence would be able to assess the cell's oscillatory state, which is our aim here."

This is remarkable because the movie from which these series were obtained present considerable variation in the image intensity (see the <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Along the same lines we do not find upwards or downwards average trends in our data of NCI time series for different conditions discussed in the main figures and in the figure supplements, which indicates further that the time series are properly normalized and reflect well the dynamics. As an additional confirmation, we have plotted together the average nuclear intensity and the NCI values obtained from manual segmentation in <a href=\"#fig1s9\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 9C</a>, that show the same kind of qualitative behavior as NCI but with different trends, as expected. A last indicator of the sensitivity of the quantifier comes from its ability to detect even small oscillatory peaks, see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> as an example. Overall, then, NCI is a faithful measure of the oscillatory state of our cells."

In order to estimate the average cytoplasmic intensity, the background was computed by taking a square area centred on the cell nucleus, dividing it in tiles and using the one with the smallest average intensity in the GFP channel to estimate the background intensity (this procedure gives values compatible with the values obtained using a clustering-based algorithm). Points belonging to the cytoplasm are those around the nucleus in a size window equal to 1.5 times the size of the nucleus.

We consider peaks as a sequence of a local minimum, local maximum and local minimum. The value of the peak \u03b8 is defined by the height of the peak (from the highest minimum to the maximum). A peak defined by only three consecutive time points is considered a noise peak. We plot the distribution of the noise peak values obtained from our unperturbed and chronic stimulation time series (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), for which we observe our previously reported spontaneous activations (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zambrano et al., 2014a</a>). We find that these noisy peaks have a low value, and hence by considering as significant those with a value over \u03b8&gt;0.15, we find a reasonably good compromise between the need to ignore noise peaks and the need to detect small peaks of valuable dynamical information. This was tested in a number of time series, and an example of time series with the significant peaks detected using this threshold is shown in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>.

This was of particular interest to obtain an assessment of the oscillatory modes present in our system, provided that peaks can be very heterogeneous and plotting the peak height in colour-plots might make it difficult to appreciate the smaller ones and hence the possible resonant oscillatory patterns. An example of this transformation is shown in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>, which is the phase derived from the peaks obtained of the time series displayed in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>.

We also normalize the amount of inhibitor as <i>I</i>= <i>NF-\u03baB/ NF-\u03baB<sub>0\u00a0</sub></i>and the amount of <i>A20</i> as <i>A= A20/ A20<sub>0</sub> </i>and <i>K=IKK/IKK<sub>0</sub></i>, where <i>A20<sub>0\u00a0</sub></i>and <i>IKK<sub>0</sub></i> are amounts of reference in such a way that <i>N, I</i> and <i>A</i> are adimensional variables of the order of 1. On the other hand, for any gene we have that the maximum number of on states is <i>G<sub>0</sub>=2</i> (the two alleles), so <i>G<sub>I</sub></i>, and <i>G<sub>A</sub></i> are a number between 0 and 1 representing the fraction of active genes encoding for <i>I\u03baB\u03b1\u00a0</i>and for <i>A20</i>, respectively \u2013\u00a0it is a continuous approximation to a discrete variable. Finally, notice that using our notation the maximum number of active genes is <i>G<sub>0</sub></i> so it can be proved that the maximum asymptotic value of the amount of RNA of the biochemical species <i>X</i> is of the form <i>K<sub>R,X</sub>\u00b7G<sub>0</sub></i>/<i>d<sub>R,X</sub>.</i> Hence, we define the variables <i>R<sub>I</sub></i>, and <i>R<sub>A\u00a0</sub></i>as proportional to the amount of mature RNA of <i>I\u03baB\u03b1\u00a0</i>and <i>A20</i>, respectively, via the relations"

We used them to generate trajectories and selected those giving rise to a response, i.e. those for which N(t) is bigger than 0.4 in the first 3\u2009hr and whose average values in the last hours was smaller or equal than N=0.4. To characterized in a systematic way their dynamics, we located the fixed point of <a href=\"#equ42\">Equations 1\u20138</a> and calculated the eigenvalues {<i>\u03bb<sub>i</sub></i>} (<i>i</i>=1,...8) of the Jacobian. In <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A</a> we plot the real and imaginary parts of each set of eigenvalues. We represent with a red dot the eigenvalues belonging to a set in which the real part of at least one of them is bigger than zero. This means that the fixed point for those parameters is unstable and hence trajectories converge to a stable limit cycle around it. In other words, for those parameter combinations sustained oscillations arise. The percentage of parameter sets giving sustained oscillations is below 10% (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>, right panel), which make us conjecture that parameters giving rise to sustained oscillations are not the norm."

We note that the intervals are very similar except for parameters <i>n</i> and <i>d<sub>A</sub></i> involved in the A20 negative feedback, which indicates that this feedback is critical in order to obtain a sustained or a damped oscillatory response. In previous works it was shown experimentally and through mathematical models that the interplay between the I\u03baB and A20 regulatory modules regulate different phases of NF-\u03baB response (<a href=\"#bib66\">Werner et al., 2008</a>). Our numerical results suggest that it also plays a key role in the type of dynamics observed (oscillatory versus damped). Overall, this analysis further hints to the fact that it is the precise combination of parameters, rather than the precise single values, what determines the type of dynamics observed and might account for the different dynamics observed with respect to other groups (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ashall et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cheng et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sung et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tay et al., 2010</a>)."

The manuscript \"NF-\u03baB oscillations translate into functionally related patterns\u2026\" by Zambrano et al. presents a systematic investigation of single-cell NF-\u03baB signaling dynamics and of population-level transcriptional responses in GFP-RelA knock-in mouse fibroblasts stimulated with controlled TNF pulses. The authors use a microfluidic device to deliver TNF to cells while avoiding the accumulation of secreted proteins. Although, this does not exclude cell-centric feedback regulation of the signaling response to TNF, the minimal ODE model proposed by Zambrano et al. nonetheless accounts well for their experimental observations and the authors conclude that NF-\u03baB behaves as a damped oscillator in these fibroblasts. That said, the reviewers have raised serious concerns about the single-cell data (detailed below) that need to be addressed."

This is essentially due to small changes in the focus, slight inclination of the plates and changes in the laser intensity that might amplify-or reduce- the amount of light measured. These changes are sizeable when the signal to noise ratio is very low, as in the case of physiological levels of p65. Photobleaching, if any, is negligible: one can see in our movies \u2013 as in <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> \u2013 that cells are bright even in late phases of the imaging. Thus our rationale is to use a ratio of background-corrected intensities, so that these distortions will cancel out; this is the same rationale that we applied in our previous works, where we used ratios of intensities to quantify the dynamics (Sung et al., 2009; Zambrano et al., 2014a)."

The mathematical discussion leads to conclude that, being a ratio of intensities, NCI is a faithful indicator of the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB and hence robust to global changes in the image intensity. We use the same reasoning to show why the background-corrected average nuclear intensity would reflect the global imaging distortions in our settings and hence would not be an adequate readout of the nuclear amount of NF-\u03baB. However, as the reviewers rightly point out, the numerator and denominator of this ratio can fluctuate due to biological reasons and this might blur or overestimate the oscillatory behavior of nuclear NF-\u03baB, which is the truly important readout. If it were possible to assess that total NF-\u03baB is constant, then the oscillations in the nuclear NF-\u03baB would correspond to oscillations in NCI, as we demonstrate in Supplemental Information, due to the fact that the latter is a monotonously increasing function of the former, (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8B</a>).

Thus, to confirm that the \u201cconstant p65\u201d assumption holds true for our GFP-p65 MEFs, we quantified p65 in cells stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 for 8 hours with sampling every hour.

Hence, as the reviewers point out, it should be expected that also different cell types will display different oscillatory behaviors: this is probably the case of those studied in the work by Kellogg and Tay 2015, but the same could applied to recently published results with fibroblasts (see e.g. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, (Cheng et al., 2015)) or macrophages (see e.g. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> in Sung et al., 2014), that present also remarkable variability of behaviors. Furthermore, the numerical exploration performed to address the previous point illustrates how variations in the parameter combinations can give rise to widely different dynamics, which hints in the same direction. We can only claim that in our cells damped oscillations are much more common; our model suggests that damped oscillations are more frequent.
