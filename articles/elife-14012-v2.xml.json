Downstream of RAS, RAF kinases are actionable targets regulating keratinocyte turnover; however, chemical RAF inhibitors paradoxically activate the pathway, promoting epidermal proliferation. We generated mice with compound epidermis-restricted BRAF/RAF1 ablation. In these animals, transient barrier defects and production of chemokines and Th2-type cytokines by keratinocytes cause a disease akin to human atopic dermatitis, characterized by IgE responses and local and systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, BRAF and RAF1 operate independently to balance MAPK signaling: BRAF promotes ERK activation, while RAF1 dims stress kinase activation. In vivo, JNK inhibition prevents disease onset, while MEK/ERK inhibition in mice lacking epidermal RAF1 phenocopies it. These results support a primary role of keratinocytes in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, and the animals lacking BRAF and RAF1 in the epidermis represent a useful model for this disease."

Downstream of RAS, RAF kinases are actionable targets regulating keratinocyte turnover; however, chemical RAF inhibitors paradoxically activate the pathway, promoting epidermal proliferation. We generated mice with compound epidermis-restricted BRAF/RAF1 ablation. In these animals, transient barrier defects and production of chemokines and Th2-type cytokines by keratinocytes cause a disease akin to human atopic dermatitis, characterized by IgE responses and local and systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, BRAF and RAF1 operate independently to balance MAPK signaling: BRAF promotes ERK activation, while RAF1 dims stress kinase activation. In vivo, JNK inhibition prevents disease onset, while MEK/ERK inhibition in mice lacking epidermal RAF1 phenocopies it. These results support a primary role of keratinocytes in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, and the animals lacking BRAF and RAF1 in the epidermis represent a useful model for this disease."

In the skin, the epidermis acts as a mechanical barrier which prevents water loss and the entry of potentially harmful chemicals; in addition, through the interplay between keratinocytes in the epidermis and immune cells based mainly in the underlying dermis, the skin works as an immunological barrier actively defending the body from pathogens (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pasparakis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nestle et al., 2009</a>). Maintaining these barrier functions throughout life requires continuous regeneration of the epidermis and appropriately balanced immune responses.

Downstream of the EGFR and RAS, it acts in hair follicle development and wound healing; its mild activation in Rasopathies, genetic diseases caused by activating mutations in the pathway, results in skin phenotypes ranging from thickening of palms and soles to the development of papillomas; and strong activation in keratinocytes results in tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kern et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ratushny et al., 2012</a>). In animal models, epidermis-restricted inducible activation of RAF or MEK causes massive cutaneous hyperplasia and reduced differentiation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Khavari and Rinn, 2007</a>). Consistently, RAF1 (also known as CRAF) and BRAF are essential for the development and progression of RAS-induced tumors although they fulfil different roles, with RAF1 preventing keratinocyte differentiation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ehrenreiter et al., 2009</a>) and BRAF promoting proliferation through MEK/ERK activation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kern et al., 2013</a>).

Reflecting the function of the pathway in skin, cutaneous toxicities are one of the main adverse effects of these therapies; they can be severe and lead to an interruption of the therapy or to its termination (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belum et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Curry et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dy and Adjei, 2013</a>).

Cutaneous inflammation induced by agents blocking EGFR (erlotinib or cetuximab) and by MEK inhibitors (selumetinib and trametinib) is characterized by papulopustular rash, pruritus, and suppurative folliculitis in \u226580% of the patients (<a href=\"#bib12\">Curry et al., 2014</a>).

The mice (heretofore referred to as \u0394/\u0394ep2) were born at Mendelian ratio but with their eyes open (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), probably as a result of the migration defects of RAF1-deficient keratinocytes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ehrenreiter et al., 2005</a>). With time, however, they started to show symptoms of a progressive skin disease. These included intense itching and scratching resulting in partial alopecia and self-inflicted wounds (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Histological examination of the non-affected areas revealed thickening of the epidermis correlated with increased proliferation and expansion of both the basal and suprabasal keratinocytes but not with keratinocyte apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Skin architecture and\u00a0keratinocyte proliferation were not\u00a0altered at this stage (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In terms of dermal infiltrate, a 2-fold increase in mast cells could already be observed, but these cells were not activated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Granulocytes and dendritic cell numbers were indistinguishable in 3 weeks old F/F2 and \u0394/\u0394ep2 littermates (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

TSLP, CCL2, CCL7, and a number of cytokines (GMCSF, IL6, 4, 5, 13, 2) were already significantly elevated in the epidermal lysates, while only a trend could be observed for others (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Systemically, enlarged lymph nodes contained increased amounts of activated T, B, and dendritic cells, while the spleen was normal both in size and cell composition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). In the blood, the number of monocytes and granulocytes was increased, as were the levels of CCL2, CCL7, and GCSF. However, no significant difference in serum IgEs could be observed at this point (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The increase in T, B, and dendritic cells in lymph nodes and the granulocytosis could be traced as far back as 10 days of age, at which time point GCSF was the only cytokine elevated in the serum of \u0394/\u0394ep2 mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013F</a>). Thus, ablation of both <i>Braf</i> and <i>Raf1</i> in mouse epidermis does not directly disturb skin architecture but rather affects the cross-talk between keratinocytes and the innate and adaptive immune system."

Consistent with this phosphorylation pattern, the levels of the dual specificity phosphatase DUSP1 and DUSP10, negative regulators of the stress kinases (<a href=\"#bib48\">Patterson et al., 2009</a>), were low in the \u0394/\u0394ep2 lysates.

MEKi efficiently reduced ERK phosphorylation and slightly increased JNK phosphorylation in both control and RAF1\u0394ep epidermal lysates, but increased p38 phosphorylation was only observed in the RAF1\u0394ep (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Consistently, MEKi reduced the expression of the phosphatases DUSP1 and 10 and of CLDN1 in RAF1\u0394ep epidermis only (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Within a month, the RAF1\u0394ep animals developed an inflammatory skin disease characterized by K6 and ICAM1 expression in the epidermis, by the presence of activated dermal mast cells and by an increase in TSLP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In control animals, inhibitor treatment did not affect, or reduced chemo- or cytokine amounts; GMCSF, IL5, IL2 and CCL4 were reduced significantly, and a trend could be observed for IL4, IL17, IL27, and CXCL1. In contrast, a comparison between inhibitor-treated RAF1F/F and RAF1\u0394ep lysates revealed a significant upregulation of CCL2, GMCSF, IL18, IL5, IL13, IL2, IL17 and CCL4 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To assess whether this was the case in vivo, we treated \u0394/\u0394ep2 animals with the specific peptide inhibitor D-JNKI1. D-JNKI1 efficiently blocked JUN phosphorylation, increased ERK and RSK phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), and prevented the development of the disease as determined by ICAM1 and TSLP expression in the epidermis as well as by eyelid inflammation and mast cells accumulation in the dermis (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013B</a>). Consistent with the data in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, K6 expression could not be observed in the interfollicular epidermis in any of the experimental groups (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Compared to untreated 3 weeks old animals, vehicle (TAT-peptide) alone had minor effects on the level of some chemokines and cytokines; the increase in IL17 and IL18 in TAT-peptide-treated \u0394/\u0394ep2 vs F/F2 animals became significant; the opposite was observed for CCL7, IL13 and IL4 (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">8C</a>; and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> with\u00a0<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> ). Treatment with D-JNKI1 reduced chemo- and cytokines in epidermal lysates of \u0394/\u0394ep2 animals to levels indistinguishable from, or lower than (CCL2, CCL4, GMCSF and IL4), those of F/F2 controls. Exceptions were IL6, which was significantly reduced in \u0394/\u0394ep2, but not in F/F2 epidermal lysates; and IL5, which was not affected by the inhibitor in either genotype (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). At the systemic level, D-JNKI1 normalized the numbers of activated B and dendritic cells in lymph nodes, while the numbers of activated T cells where reduced in both F/F2 and \u0394/\u0394ep2 lymph nodes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Thus, JNK activation and the resulting chemo- and cytokine accumulation in the epidermis are required for disease development."

MLK3 downregulation by two independent shRNAs strongly reduced both ERK and JNK phosphorylation in F/F2 cells treated with EGF and proinflammatory stimuli; however, in \u0394/\u0394ep2 cells, only JNK phosphorylation was reduced (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>).

We describe an essential role of BRAF and RAF1 in keratinocytes in the control of allergic inflammation. Mice lacking BRAF/RAF1 in keratinocytes develop a disease clinically very similar to human atopic dermatitis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bieber, 2010</a>). It starts with a barrier defect accompanied by the reduced expression of crucial tight junction proteins and by a marginally increased expression of chemokines and cytokines, particularly CCL2, IL6 and IL18. It then progresses to a stage in which the skin appears unaffected, yet both local (mast cell infiltration, chemokine and cytokine production) and systemic (T and B\u00a0cell activation, increased amounts of circulating leukocytes and chemokines) anomalies become evident while TSLP and IgE levels are only slightly increased. This is reminiscent of the early phase of atopic dermatitis in children, prior to IgE sensitization (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bieber, 2010</a>). Unlike the majority of atopic dermatitis patients (<a href=\"#bib14\">De Benedetto et al., 2012</a>), however, the \u0394/\u0394ep2 animals don\u2019t have a stratum corneum defect, which may help explain the lack of symptoms at this stage. Adult mice present with a full-fledged disease characterized by rich dermal infiltrates, increased cytokine production, clearly elevated IgEs and mast cell activation, in good correlation with the intense pruritus causing extensive scratching and self-inflicted wounds. The initial barrier defect contributes to full-fledged disease, since ablation of BRAF/RAF1 after the third week causes a less severe condition lacking IgE sensitization and mast cell activation, yet recapitulating the systemic symptoms of the disease. This could be likened to late-onset, IgE-sensitization-independent dermatitis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bieber, 2010</a>). Thus, BRAF and RAF1 act together to ensure the timely establishment of the inside-out barrier of the epidermis and to prevent allergic inflammation. The data support the hypothesis that the keratinocytes play a primary role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, and the \u0394/\u0394ep2 animals may be useful as a model for this disease (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>)."

Conversely, the set of cytokines (TSLP, IL5, IL13, IL18, borderline IL2 and IL17) observed in adult, diseased \u0394/\u0394ep2 mice was similar to that promoting symptomatic disease in RAF1\u0394ep animals treated with trametinib, which showed an increase in TSLP, IL2, IL5, IL13, as well as in IL18. These data can be interpreted to mean that ERK signaling negatively regulates the production of allergy-promoting factors. However, it is important to note that trametinib treatment reduced IL2 and IL5 as well as GMCSF in the F/F2 epidermis, indicating that sensitivity to ERK inhibition must be seen in the context of altered cell-autonomous signaling (increased JNK activation in RAF1\u0394ep epidermis) and/or tissue milieu. Along the same lines, \u0394/\u0394ep2 keratinocytes treated with inflammatory stimuli were significantly more efficient than F/F2 in producing CCL2, CCL7, IL6, IL18, TSLP and IL13, but not IL2 or IL5, resembling, but not fully reproducing, the spectrum observed in epidermal lysates. At this stage, it is impossible to determine whether these discrepancies might be due to the presence of cell types other than keratinocytes in the epidermal lysates or whether the culture and stimulation conditions used did not recapitulate the situation in vivo."

High levels of TSLP (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu, 2006</a>), but also of IL5 and IL13 have been reported in the skin of atopic dermatitis patients, particularly in those with elevated IgEs (<a href=\"#bib32\">Jeong et al., 2003</a>). In mice, it could be shown that the expression of TSLP (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu, 2006</a>), IL4, IL5 and IL13 induces atopic dermatitis as well as asthma (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lee and Flavell, 2004</a>), and IL5 knockout mice exposed to allergens are less prone than wild-type to develop skin eosinophilia and epidermal thickening (<a href=\"#bib56\">Spergel et al., 1999</a>). Finally, expression of IL13 in keratinocytes is sufficient to induce a disease mimicking atopic dermatitis (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zheng et al., 2009</a>). Thus, these cytokines appear instrumental for the development of atopic dermatitis with IgE sensitization. IL18, on the other hand, can stimulate both Th1 and Th2 responses (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nakanishi et al., 2001</a>), and appears to be causally involved in a different type of atopic dermatitis. IL18 is essential for the induction of dermatitis by the epidermis-restricted expression of caspase\u00a01, the enzyme that generates active IL18 from its precursor. In addition, expression of IL18 in keratinocytes induces a late-onset dermatitis associated with mastocytosis, but independent of IgE production (<a href=\"#bib36\">Konishi et al., 2002</a>). More recently, IL18 knockout mice were shown to be resistant to infection-associated atopic dermatitis, in a mouse model generated by perturbing the stratum corneum with detergent prior to topical application of <i>S. aureus</i> protein A (<a href=\"#bib59\">Terada et al., 2006</a>). However, stratum corneum defects could not be observed in \u0394/\u0394ep2 mice, and caspase\u00a01 ablation does not modify the course of the \u0394/\u0394ep2 disease. Thus, IL18 is not a determining factor in the context of the \u0394/\u0394ep2 dermatitis, which rather resembles a Th2/IgE-driven disease."

Decreased ERK and increased JNK activation are observed in \u0394/\u0394ep2 epidermis in vivo independently of the severity of the disease as well as in \u0394/\u0394ep2 keratinocytes and BRAF/RAF1 knockdown HaCat cells. Thus, the imbalance in MAPK signaling represents an intrinsic defect of cells and tissues lacking BRAF/RAF1. While BRAF ablation, as in many other tissues/organs, is responsible for reduced ERK activation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Desideri et al., 2015</a>), RAF1 ablation correlates with a previously unnoticed increase in stress kinase activation. Consistent with this, we have observed a reduction in the expression of two DUSPs involved in the inactivation of stress kinases, which is strongest in the \u0394/\u0394ep2 epidermis. This is in line with the reported positive role of p38 in the induction of DUSP expression and of ERK in its attenuation at multiple levels (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caunt and Keyse, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Taxman et al., 2011</a>), which would predict that decreased ERK signaling would be needed to reduce DUSP expression and stabilize JNK phosphorylation when p38 is active. Importantly, both DUSPs have been implicated in the production of cytokines by immunocompetent cells and in murine models of inflammatory and autoimmune disease (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lang et al., 2006</a>)."

The lack of basal JNK activation in unstimulated cells suggests a cross-talk at the level of BRAF/RAF1 and MLK3 rather than direct MLK3 activation by BRAF/RAF1 ablation. Such a cross-talk was previously reported to occur in the context of ERK signaling, which is positively regulated by MLK3 via the stabilization of the RAF dimer (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chadee and Kyriakis, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chadee et al., 2006</a>). It is possible that in turn, BRAF and RAF1 would restrict the involvement of MLK3 in the JNK pathway, at the same time promoting ERK and reducing JNK activation in stimulated cells (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>)."

The second set of experiments also clearly shows that the function of BRAF and RAF1 in the epidermis is not redundant. Finally, the combined RAF knockout and inhibitor data help explain why in patients the cutaneous toxicity of RAF inhibitors, which increase ERK activation, is mostly related to hyperproliferation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anforth et al., 2013</a>), while inhibitors of ERK activation promote the onset or exacerbate the course of cutaneous inflammatory reactions involving stress kinase activation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Curry et al., 2014</a>)."

The authors show that BRAF is required for ERK activation and that RAF1 suppresses the activation of the stress-activated MAP kinases JNK and p38. Inhibition of JNK in mice prevents the skin defects while inhibition of MEK in mice lacking epidermal RAF1 promotes these."

Therefore, we have attempted to perform the requested experiments/controls only for MLK3 knockdown in \u0394/\u0394ep2 keratinocytes (see also response to point 4). Knockdown/re-expression experiments in primary mouse keratinocytes are notoriously difficult; we have succeeded in targeting MLK3 with two separate hairpins encoded by a lentiviral vector, but the reconstitution experiments using a single vector expressing both the hairpin and WT or shRNA-resistant MLK3 have failed because the infection efficiency with these large constructs went from 60-90% to less than 20%. This is a problem because keratinocytes cannot be FACS-sorted \u2013 they will not reattach and in fact will die after sorting. Irrespective of this, we now show that MLK3 knockdown by two distinct shRNAs in primary keratinocytes (revised <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E\u2013F</a> and Figure legend to <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>; discussed in the last paragraph of the subsection \u201cInterfering with the JNK pathway decreases the production of proinflammatory molecules in primary \u0394/\u0394ep2 keratinocytes and RAF knockdown HaCat cells\u201d) has the same effect as MLK3 knockdown by a pool of siRNAs targeting distinct sites in HaCat cells (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a> of the revised version).
