Can you follow the conversation with your friend easily, or does the high noise level in general or more specifically the conversations heard from other tables interfere with speech intelligibility? While the human auditory system has impressive abilities in structuring the mixture of sound waves arriving at the ears into different auditory objects or streams (auditory scene analysis; e.g., <a href=\"#bib9\">Bregman, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Carlyon, 2004</a>), listeners show considerable variation when it comes to speech understanding in adverse acoustic conditions, such as the almost proverbial '<i>cocktail-party</i>' situation described above (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bronkhorst, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cherry, 1953</a>). Surprisingly, pronounced individual differences in speech identification in background noise are observed even in listeners with <i>normal hearing</i>, that is, with audiometric thresholds better than 20 dB HL within the frequency range most important for speech (100\u2009Hz\u20134 kHz; <a href=\"#bib15\">Byrne\u00a0et\u00a0al., 1994</a>), usually taken as an indication of approximately intact processing in the inner ear. For example, <a href=\"#bib89\">Ruggles and Shinn-Cunningham (2011)</a> tested normal-hearing subjects in a simulated cocktail-party listening task with two competing speakers presented 15\u00b0 to the left and right of the target speaker. Across listeners, the percentage of correct responses in reporting a sequence of digits produced by the target speaker varied between 40% and 85% in an anechoic condition. Compatible with these experimental results, in clinical settings a relevant number of patients with normal audiometric findings complain about hearing difficulties in daily life (<a href=\"#bib115\">Zhao and Stephens, 2007</a>)."

                        "text": "Understanding speech in a cocktail-party situation with interfering speakers and other background noise requires <i>selective attention</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bronkhorst, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cherry, 1953</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Shinn-Cunningham, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Xiang et al., 2010</a>), and was even proposed to be the '<i>best-known real life example of selective attention</i>' (<a href=\"#bib80\">Pashler, 1998</a>). The information from the target speaker needs to be processed, while information from other sound sources should be ignored. The main hypothesis tested in the present study was that individual differences in the <i>capability to direct auditory selective attention to the relevant stimulus in the presence of distractors</i> explain a significant proportion of the inter-individual variance in cocktail-party listening performance. Although several aspects of speech appear to be processed outside the focus of attention (<a href=\"#bib84\">Pulverm\u00fcller and Shtyrov, 2006</a>), attention enhances the representation of speech (and other sounds) at relatively early stages (e.g., <a href=\"#bib20\">Choi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Srinivasan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Xiang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib116\">Zion Golumbic et al., 2013</a>). On the behavioral level, the importance of attention is illustrated by studies that manipulated the a-priori information concerning the target speaker. For instance, in an experiment by <a href=\"#bib57\">Kidd et al. (2005)</a>; the speech identification performance was better when the listener knew in advance which of three talkers (presented at different spatial positions) would be the target speaker, compared to conditions where the target location was uncertain. Thus, for exactly identical acoustic signals, being able to direct attention to the correct location results in a large improvement in speech recognition (e.g., <a href=\"#bib5\">Best et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Kitterick et al., 2010</a>). The direction of selective attention to the target speaker can be impaired due to limitations imposed by the <i>acoustic signal</i> or by <i>perceptual or cognitive characteristics of the listener</i> (cf. <a href=\"#bib67\">Mattys et al., 2012</a>). If a listener has problems in using acoustic cues for the formation of auditory objects or streams, or on a more cognitive level is incapable of ignoring irrelevant information, then speech identification performance will be low even when fundamental frequency, timbre, and spatial location of the speakers differ."

In a cocktail party situation, it is required to attend to a certain speaker (target) and to ignore the other sound sources (distractors). We were interested in whether speech understanding in a cocktail-party situation could be related to a more general ability to focus attention on a target in the presence of distractors. Surprisingly, this particular aspect of attention has not been studied very systematically in previous experiments that investigated the role of attention for speech understanding in noise (<a href=\"#bib36\">F\u00fcllgrabe et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Gatehouse and Akeroyd, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Heinrich et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Neher et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib73\">2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Schoof and Rosen, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">van Rooij et al., 1989</a>). Most of these studies used tests developed for neuropsychological settings, like the Test of Everyday Attention (TEA; <a href=\"#bib85\">Robertson et al., 1996</a>) and the Trail Making Tests (TMT; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bowie and Harvey, 2006</a>), indexing <i>visual search</i> (TEA Map Search, Telephone Search), <i>task/attentional switching</i> (TEA Visual Elevator and Auditory Elevator with Reversal, TMT-B), <i>sustained attention</i> (TMT-A, TEA Lottery Test and Elevator Counting), or <i>divided attention</i> (TEA Telephone Search While Counting). Only one TEA subtest (\"Elevator counting with distraction\") directly addresses the capability to ignore distractors. Here, participants have to count low pitch tones ('targets') while ignoring interspersed high pitch tones ('distractors'). We are aware of only two studies that included this subtest (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gatehouse and Akeroyd, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Neher et al., 2009</a>), in hearing-impaired listeners. Concerning the other tasks, while switching attention is relevant for situations where the target speaker changes dynamically, for example in a conversation involving more than two persons, there are many situations where the target speaker does not change. Visual search and sustained attention seem even less relevant for cocktail-party listening. For this reason, our study included tasks in which subjects had to <i>identify an auditory or visual target element in the presence of distractors</i>. In our view, this is the most important aspect of attention in cocktail-party listening."

In the critical <i>incompatible condition</i>, the flankers and the target call for opposite responses. If the incompatible flankers produce only small response time (RT) costs, then the participant has a high ability to focus visual selective attention on the target stimulus. This flanker interference is defined as the difference between the average response time (RT) in the incompatible condition and in a neutral condition where the flankers are not associated with one of the responses relevant for the target."

Instead, strong effects of the backward masker on intensity discrimination can be explained by a failure to selectively attend to the target sounds while ignoring the maskers (<a href=\"#bib79\">Oberfeld and Stahn, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Oberfeld et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Schlauch et al., 1997</a>).

These differences were proposed to be due to cochlear neuropathy, which could for instance be caused by moderate noise exposure (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bharadwaj et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</a>) and is sometimes described as 'hidden hearing loss' (<a href=\"#bib81\">Plack et al., 2014</a>) because it cannot be detected using standard measures of audiometric threshold. Several studies showed a correlation between TFS sensitivity and the recognition of speech in noise, for normal-hearing as well as for hearing-impaired listeners (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bharadwaj et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">F\u00fcllgrabe et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Neher et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Ruggles et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Schoof and Rosen, 2014</a>).

To answer this question, a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted (the statistical details are described in Materials and methods). The criterion variable was the speech recognition score (SRS) defined as the proportion correct in the simulated cocktail-party listening task with two interfering speakers. We used a sentence identification task based on a German matrix test (<a href=\"#bib107\">Wagener et al., 1999a</a>) and presented binaural simulations of an anechoic environment (see Materials and methods). The nine predictors were (1) the elevation of the intensity difference limen caused by the backward masker (DL<sub>elev</sub>), defined as the difference between the DL under masking and the DL in quiet, which measures the capability of directing auditory selective attention to a target (<a href=\"#bib78\">Oberfeld et al., 2014</a>), (2) the amount of flanker interference in the flanker task (Int<sub>Flanker</sub>), which indexes visual selective attention, (3) the IPD threshold in the TFS-LF (<a href=\"#bib49\">Hopkins and Moore, 2010</a>) test (TFS<sub>th</sub>), which measures binaural sensitivity for the temporal fine structure, (4) the pure-tone average threshold on the better ear (PTA<sub>BE</sub>) at octave frequencies between 125\u2009Hz and 4 kHz, (5) the average asymmetry in the hearing thresholds between left and right ear in the same frequency range (HL<sub>diff</sub>), (6) the intensity-DL in quiet (DL<sub>quiet</sub>), which represents a suprathreshold measure of hearing ability that is not related to selective attention, (7) the response time in the neutral condition of the flanker task (RT<sub>neutral</sub>), which was included as a measure of processing speed (<a href=\"#bib92\">Salthouse, 2000</a>), and (8) the proportion of correctly recalled consonants in the sentence span task (SS<sub>Pcorr</sub>) that indexes working memory capacity. Finally, (9) the age of the participant was added as a predictor, as in previous studies (e.g., <a href=\"#bib74\">Neher et al., 2012</a>), to investigate whether the observed inter-individual differences in cocktail-party listening are determined by other factors related to age.

As can be seen in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, the performance in the cocktail-party listening task was significantly negatively related to the intensity-DL elevation under backward masking. Thus, compatible with our hypotheses, participants who showed a better capability of focusing attention on the target sounds in the intensity discrimination task were less affected by the interfering speakers in the cocktail-party listening task. In the same line of reasoning, the significant negative regression coefficient for flanker interference shows that a high capability of directing visual selective attention corresponded to good performance on the cocktail-party listening task. The IPD threshold measured in the TFS-LF task was also significantly negatively related to the SRS. Thus, compatible with previous studies (e.g., <a href=\"#bib36\">F\u00fcllgrabe et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Neher et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Ruggles et al., 2012</a>), listeners who showed high sensitivity for the TFS performed better in the spatial listening task. None of the remaining predictors showed a significant association with the performance in the spatial listening task. Notably, neither for age nor for working memory capacity did the regression coefficient differ significantly from 0."

In our data, the nine predictors were partly correlated (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). In such a case, it can be misleading to gauge the\u00a0relative importance of the predictors by considering the squared standardized regression coefficients (cf. <a href=\"#bib104\">Tonidandel and LeBreton, 2011</a>). For this reason, we used the 'dominance analysis' approach proposed by <a href=\"#bib13\">Budescu (1993)</a>; which was shown to be a useful measure of the relative importance of predictors in a regression model, both on theoretical grounds and in simulation studies (<a href=\"#bib64\">LeBreton et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Thomas et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Tonidandel and LeBreton, 2011</a>). Dominance analysis provides a quantitative measure of relative importance by examining the change in the variance-accounted-for (\u0394<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) resulting from adding a predictor to all possible regression models containing subsets of the predictors. For example, if there are three predictors (A, B, and C), then there are four possible subset models to which predictor C can be added (that\u00a0is, models containing only the intercept term, intercept and predictor A, intercept and predictor B, and intercept and predictors A and B, respectively). A predictor\u2019s <i>general dominance weight</i> (GDW; <a href=\"#bib2\">Azen and Budescu, 2003</a>) is found by averaging the squared semipartial correlations across all of the possible subset models. This measure indexes a variable's contribution to the prediction of the dependent variable, by itself and in combination with the other predictors. The sum of the GDWs is the total proportion of variance explained by the regression model, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>."

The contribution of flanker interference was much lower, and the GDW for the non-significant predictor sentence span was even slightly higher than the GDW for flanker interference."

The Lasso approach is widely used in the field of statistical learning (<a href=\"#bib47\">Hastie et al., 2009</a>). It involves a tuning parameter \u03bb to impose a so-called <i>l</i><sub>1</sub>-penalty (<a href=\"#bib103\">Tibshirani, 2011</a>) on the regression model. We used 4-fold cross-validation for selecting the best model, that is, the optimal value of \u03bb (<a href=\"#bib52\">James et al., 2013</a>). In cross-validation, the set of observations is randomly divided into <i>k</i> groups of approximately equal size. The first group is treated as a validation set, and the model is fit on the remaining <i>k</i> \u2212 1 groups. The mean squared error is computed on the observations in the validation set, and this procedure is repeated <i>k</i> times, each time selecting a different group of observations as the validation set. In this approach, first the \u03bb value corresponding to the smallest cross-validation error is selected, and then the regression model is fit to all of the available observations using the selected value of \u03bb. Compatible with the dominance analysis presented above, the model selected by the Lasso method contained the predictors DL<sub>elev</sub>, TFS<sub>th</sub>, and Int<sub>Flanker</sub> (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), and the highest regression coefficients were estimated for DL<sub>elev</sub> and TFS<sub>th</sub>.

Our main hypothesis was that individual differences in the ability to direct auditory selective attention to the relevant stimulus, while ignoring distractors, explain a significant proportion of the inter-individual variance in cocktail-party listening performance. To test this hypothesis, we included tasks that assessed auditory and visual selective attention in the presence of distractors, using non-speech stimuli. Among the many different aspects of attention (cf. <a href=\"#bib100\">Styles, 2006</a>), this ability seems particularly relevant in a cocktail-party situation where it is necessary to selectively attend to the target speaker and to ignore the interfering speakers and other background noise (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bronkhorst, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Shinn-Cunningham, 2008</a>)."

Together, the two measures of selective attention explained approximately the same proportion of variance as the binaural TFS sensitivity, which was the predictor with the highest relative importance (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). These results are compatible with our hypothesis that not only rather basic auditory factors like spatial hearing abilities contribute to individual differences in cocktail-party listening, but that in the cognitive domain a general ability of focusing attention on a relevant target stimulus represents an additional important predictor. One of the few previous studies that measured selective attention in the presence of distractors (<a href=\"#bib39\">Gatehouse and Akeroyd, 2008</a>) found that in unaided hearing-impaired listeners (mean age about 66 years) the word recognition performance in static background noise was positively related to performance in the 'Elevator counting with distraction' subtest of the Tests of Everyday Attention. However, the analysis did not control for effects of age. In a recent study (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cahana-Amitay\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2016</a>), a composite score for 'inhibition' that included the error rate in an incongruent condition of the Stroop color-word test (<a href=\"#bib99\">Stroop, 1935</a>) was negatively correlated with sentence-final word recognition (controlling for age) in a group of subjects ranging in age between 55 and 84 years."

Thus, it seems more appropriate to recognize that attention has many facets (<a href=\"#bib100\">Styles, 2006</a>), to not aggregate across the performance on tasks measuring very different aspects of attention in order to define a general 'attention' factor, and to formulate hypotheses concerning the potential importance of a particular aspect of attention for speech identification in noise. In this line of thinking, we note that in the simulated cocktail-party listening task as well as in the two tasks measuring auditory and visual selective attention, the participants had a-priori knowledge of the spatial or temporal position of the target. For this reason, the direction of attention to the target could be viewed as being endogenous (top-down) rather than exogenous (bottom up) (<a href=\"#bib83\">Posner, 1980</a>). Limitations in the ability to focus attention while\u00a0performing these tasks should thus be related to the dorsal fronto-parietal attentional system in the cortex rather than to the ventral network (cf. <a href=\"#bib14\">Buschman and Miller, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</a>). To test this hypothesis, future experiments on attentional factors influencing cocktail-party listening could include tasks measuring both the endogenous and exogenous orienting of attention, using for instance temporal or spatial cueing (e.g., <a href=\"#bib25\">Coull and Nobre, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Posner, 1980</a>). Alternatively, one could argue that in the intensity discrimination task, the onset of the backward masker elicits a capture of attention away from the target tones (e.g., <a href=\"#bib31\">Desimone and Duncan, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Jonides and Yantis, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Yantis and Jonides, 1990</a>). Thus, it might even be necessary to further qualify the description of the particular aspect of attention that is indexed by the intensity discrimination task under backward masking and say that is measures the ability to suppress salient, but task-irrelevant auditory events."

Thus, although the sentence identification task we presented requires working memory for storing the sequence of five words, the performance on this task appeared to be more strongly limited by failures of selective attention than by memory aspects. This result is compatible with previous data indicating that working memory capacity and speech identification in noise are associated in older, hearing-impaired participants (see <a href=\"#bib1\">Akeroyd, 2008</a>), while in normal hearing subjects this correlation is weaker or even absent (<a href=\"#bib37\">F\u00fcllgrabe et al., 2016</a>). Thus, measures of selective attention should be included in future studies instead of focusing only on working memory capacity. In general, working memory and attention are not independent (<a href=\"#bib26\">Cowan et al., 2005</a>). For instance, <a href=\"#bib22\">Conway et al. (2001)</a> studied the probability that in a dichotic listening task participants recognize their own name on the ignored channel (<a href=\"#bib71\">Moray, 1959</a>), and found that this probability was higher in participants with a low WM span. Also, the working memory load affects speech understanding in a cocktail-party setting (<a href=\"#bib35\">Francis, 2010</a>). In line with these results, in our data the working memory span showed a marginally significant negative correlation (controlling for age) with the DL-elevation (auditory selective attention), see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>."

The significant negative association between the IPD threshold and the SRS could be attributed to a reduced benefit from ITD cues in listeners with impaired binaural TFS sensitivity, although a reduction in TFS sensitivity could be also associated with other perceptual impairments beyond sound source localization (<a href=\"#bib70\">Moore, 2008</a>). Spatial cues facilitate auditory streaming/grouping (e.g., <a href=\"#bib29\">Darwin and Hukin, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">David et al., 2015</a>), selective attention (e.g.,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib51\">Ihlefeld and Shinn-Cunningham, 2008</a>), and speech recognition (e.g., <a href=\"#bib27\">Culling et al., 2004</a>). The importance of spatial cues was reported to increase with the number of interfering sound sources (<a href=\"#bib112\">Yost et al., 1996</a>). Thus, one should expect a smaller influence of TFS sensitivity in situations with only one interfering speaker (compared to two as in the present study). Also, the simulated anechoic environment might have caused an overestimation of the importance of ITD cues. In a typical reverberant environment, spatial cues to sound source segregation are reduced (e.g., <a href=\"#bib63\">Lavandier and Culling, 2010</a>). It remains to be shown whether the ability to attend to a target in the presence of distractors plays a stronger role than binaural TFS sensitivity in a reverberant setting. On the other hand, the spatial separation of 25\u00b0 between target and distractor speakers was larger than in some previous studies that used a separation of only 15\u00b0 (<a href=\"#bib87\">Ruggles et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib88\">2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib89\">Ruggles and Shinn-Cunningham, 2011</a>). The corresponding stronger ITD cues in our study might have reduced the importance of the sensory representation of the acoustic stimulus for task performance, which would emphasize the relative importance of central factors. Note that in cocktail-party situations in daily life, the spatial separation between the target speakers and competing speakers will often be even larger than 25\u00b0."

The sample size in our study was larger than in some previous experiments, so that it was possible to measure the influence of several variables on sentence identification in noise, without first combining predictors into a small number of factors. We also used multiple linear regression analyses, rather than pairwise correlations as in some previous experiments. Predictors like hearing thresholds, age, working memory span and TFS sensitivity are partly correlated (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Multiple linear regression accounts for correlations among the predictors (<a href=\"#bib41\">Gauss, 1821</a>), while interpreting pairwise correlations is extremely difficult for a large set of intercorrelated predictors. Unlike most previous studies, we also report the reliability of the measured variables, which in most cases was acceptable to high. Finally, we used two established approaches for assessing the relative importance of predictors, dominance analysis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Budescu, 1993</a>) and Lasso (<a href=\"#bib102\">Tibshirani, 1996</a>). The Lasso method was proposed to avoid some of the problems of forward or backward selection in stepwise regression (<a href=\"#bib45\">Harrell, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">James et al., 2013</a>)."

First, we included only a single measure each for auditory and selective attention in the presence of distractors. From a psychometric point of view, it would be desirable to include different paradigms, in order to test whether the results generalize to different tasks indexing selective attention, and to increase the reliability of the measures of selective attention. In the auditory modality, we used intensity discrimination under backward masking as an index of selective attention. In this task, the target sounds have to be selected on the basis of their temporal position within a trial. We had decided against a task measuring the <i>spatial</i> direction of attention (e.g., <a href=\"#bib90\">Sach et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Spence and Driver, 1994</a>) because the performance on such a task depends on abilities of spatial hearing, which we assessed separately in terms of the binaural TFS sensitivity. Also, the precise perception of the temporal structure of speech is important for intelligibility (<a href=\"#bib117\">Zion Golumbic et al., 2012</a>), and non-simultaneous masking can negatively affect speech identification (<a href=\"#bib32\">Dirks and Bower, 1970</a>). Still, it would be interesting to study whether the spatial direction of attention shows a similar relation to cocktail-party listening as the temporal direction of attention. Spatial and temporal attention were reported to involve different brain areas (e.g., <a href=\"#bib69\">Michalka et al., 2015</a>)."

Age-related changes in selective attention have been reported (<a href=\"#bib113\">Zanto and\u00a0Gazzaley, 2014</a>), just as for other cognitive skills (e.g., <a href=\"#bib91\">Salthouse, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Sander et al., 2012</a>). At the same time, the probability of audiometrically relevant hearing losses as well as of 'hidden hearing losses' (<a href=\"#bib81\">Plack et al., 2014</a>) increases with age, partly due to noise exposure across the life span. In fact, the TFS sensitivity shows a gradual deterioration with age in normal-hearing listeners (<a href=\"#bib38\">F\u00fcllgrabe, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Grose and Mamo, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">King et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Ross et al., 2007</a>).

These characteristics likely rendered the task more difficult than a realistic cocktail-party listening situation. On the other hand, communication situations in daily life often include some relatively static background noise in addition to competing speakers, while in our experiment no background noise was presented. Taken together, we assume realistic communication situations to be somewhat, but not dramatically, less difficult than the simulated cocktail-party listening task we presented. For this reason, although the average speech identification performance should be somewhat better in many realistic situations, we do not assume the latter situations to be so easy that individual differences are strongly reduced. Thus, the association between for selective attention in the presence of distractors or binaural TFS-sensitivity and speech-in-noise identification should apply to other cocktail-party situations, although ultimately this is an empirical question that should be tested in future experiments."

Previous studies had reported that speech identification in multitalker situations is associated not only to auditory abilities such as binaural TFS sensitivity, but also to cognitive factors, predominantly in older and often hearing-impaired listeners (e.g., <a href=\"#bib1\">Akeroyd, 2008</a>) but also in young normal-hearing listeners (<a href=\"#bib114\">Zekveld et al., 2013</a>). Our results highlight the importance of studying aspects of attention directly relevant for speech identification in noise, rather than measuring associations with less relevant facets of attention such as visual search or to aggregate across very different aspects of attention in order to define a general 'attention' factor."

The speech material consists of sentences with the syntactic structure <i>name-verb-numeral-adjective-object</i> (e.g., 'Peter kauft vier kleine Messer' \u2013 'Peter buys four small knives'). The sentences were constructed by pseudo-randomly selecting one of ten alternatives for each word position. This results in syntactically correct but semantically unpredictable sentences, which makes it possible to use each sentence several times for the same listener. In total, 100 different sentences are available in the OLSA test. The sentences are produced by an adult male speaker and are optimized for similar intelligibility (<a href=\"#bib108\">Wagener et al., 1999b</a>). The task was to identify the sentence produced by the target speaker. The matrix of 5 (word position) \u00d7 10 (alternatives) words constituting the sentence test was displayed on a computer monitor. On each trial, subjects were asked to select the five words they had just heard using a computer mouse. The selected words were displayed in a row below the matrix of test words.

An rmANOVA conducted on the data from blocks 2 and 3 still showed a significant while rather weak effect of block on the SRS, <i>F</i>(1, 49) = 4.54, <i>p</i>=0.038, <a href=\"#bib21\">Cohen (1988)</a> <i>d<sub>z</sub></i> = 0.30. The degree of agreement between the two measurements of the SRS (blocks 2 and 3) represents test-retest reliability and was assessed by an absolute agreement definition of the intraclass correlation in a two-way mixed-model (ICC(A,2) in the nomenclature of <a href=\"#bib68\">McGraw and Wong, 1996</a>). The reliability was high, ICC(A,2) =0.934."

The targets and the maskers were 1-kHz pure tones with a steady-state duration of 20 ms, presented to the right ear. The tones were gated on and off with 5-ms cosine-squared ramps. The standard level was 60 dB SPL. An intensity increment \u2013 that is, a pure tone of the same frequency, duration and temporal envelope \u2013 was added in-phase to the standard in one of the observation intervals (selected randomly). The level of the backward masker was 90 dB SPL. The silent interval between standard offset and masker onset was 50 ms (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This ISI value is in the range where the\u00a0effects of backward and forward masking on speech identification were observed (<a href=\"#bib32\">Dirks and Bower, 1970</a>). The temporal interval between the onsets of the two target tones (standard and standard-plus-increment) was 800 ms. The task was to select the interval containing the louder target tone (that is, the standard-plus-increment), and to ignore the maskers. Visual trial-by-trial feedback was provided. In the adaptive procedure, the initial level of the intensity increment, expressed in terms of 10 log<sub>10</sub>(\u25b3<i>I</i>/<i>I</i>), where \u25b3<i>I</i> is the intensity difference between the standard-plus-increment and the standard and <i>I</i> is the intensity of the standard, was 8 dB. For the in-quiet condition, the step size was 5 dB until the third reversal, and 2 dB for the remaining six reversals. In the backward-masking condition, four reversals were collected with the larger and eight reversals with the smaller step size. The arithmetic mean of 10 log<sub>10</sub>(\u25b3<i>I</i>/<i>I</i>) from the fourth (in quiet) or fifth reversal (backward masking) up to the last even-numbered reversal was taken as the difference limen corresponding to 79.4% correct.

In a two-interval task, four pure tones (500\u2009Hz) were presented binaurally in each interval. In one of the intervals (selected randomly), the second and fourth tone were presented with an IPD greater than 0\u00b0 between the right and left ear, while the IPD was 0\u00b0 for the first and the third tone. If the listener is sensitive to the change in IPD, then the four tones are perceived as changing in lateralization. In the other interval, all tones were presented with an interaural phase difference of IPD = 0\u00b0, corresponding to no change in lateralization from tone to tone. All tones were presented at 30 dB SL with a steady-state duration of 300 ms and 50 ms cosine-squared on- and offset ramps, 20 ms pauses between the tones within an interval, and 200 ms silence between the two intervals. The task was to identify the interval which contained the tones with the phase shift and thus elicited the perception of a location change. Visual trial-by-trial feedback was provided. The initial phase shift was IPD =180\u00b0 and was divided by <i>a</i> = (1.25)<sup>2</sup> in case of three consecutive correct responses, or multiplied by <i>a</i> after an incorrect response (three\u00a0down, one\u00a0up rule). After the third reversal, the step size was reduced to <i>a</i> = 1.25. The experimental block ended when nine reversals had been collected or 70 trials had been presented. The geometric mean of the IPD at the last six reversals was taken as the IPD threshold. After a brief practice block, two threshold estimates were obtained. Adaptive tracks in which the SD of the log<sub>10</sub>-\u00a0transformed\u00a0values of the IPD at the counting reversals was higher than 0.3 or where less than 4 reversals had been collected were excluded from the analysis, which affected only 2 of the 100 tracks. The arithmetic mean of the IPD threshold obtained in the two blocks presenting the TFS-LF test was used as a predictor in the regression analyses (TFS<sub>th</sub>), representing <i>sensitivity for the temporal fine structure</i>.

The participants' task was to decide whether a target line presented on a computer screen was dotted or dashed. The target line was presented in vertical orientation, on the center of the display. It was surrounded by other lines, the so-called flankers. In one condition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, right column), the two vertical lines adjacent to the target line were associated with the <i>incompatible</i> response. If the target line was dashed, the distractor lines were dotted, and vice versa. In a control condition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, left column), the adjacent distractor lines were solid, and thus not associated with one of the responses relevant for the target line, this is the <i>neutral condition</i>. The two flanker lines adjacent to the target line were either connected with the target line with horizontal solid lines (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, upper row), or they were connected with two additional, vertically oriented solid lines (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, lower row). In the former condition ('same object'), the target line and the distractor lines can be expected to be perceived as belonging to the same visual object (<a href=\"#bib61\">Kramer and Jacobson, 1991</a>). In the latter condition ('different object'), the target line and the distractors should be grouped into separate objects. According to the concept of object-based attention (e.g., <a href=\"#bib54\">Kahneman et al., 1981</a>), ignoring the flankers should be more difficult if the flankers and the target are perceived as belonging to the same object. To further emphasize the grouping, the target line and the adjacent flankers were presented in the same color in the same-object condition, and in different colors in the different-object condition. The colors blue and green were used, and the target line was equally often presented in blue and in green."

A computer version was used (<a href=\"#bib66\">Lewandowsky et al., 2010</a>). On each trial, the participants saw an alternating sequence of sentences and consonants. The task was to judge the correctness of each sentence and to remember the following consonant for later serial recall. The sentences were taken from the 'easy' variant of the German version (WMC Multilingual, downloaded from <a href=\"http://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/fachrichtungen/allgpsy/Software.html\">http://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/fachrichtungen/allgpsy/Software.html</a>). After a 1.5\u2009s fixation cross, the first semantically correct (e.g., 'Every rabbit has fur.') or incorrect (e.g., 'Tomorrow is in the past.') sentence appeared centrally on the screen. The participants pressed one of two designated buttons on a computer keyboard to classify the sentence as correct or incorrect. On button press, the sentence disappeared and a single consonant was presented centrally for 1\u2009s. After a 100-ms blank interval, the next sentence appeared. Depending on the list length, three to seven of these sentence-consonant sequences were presented. After the complete list had been presented, the participant was asked to type the remembered series of consonants into a response box displayed on the computer screen. The participants were required to type as many letters as were actually presented in the trial. They were informed that the order of letters mattered and were hence instructed to guess if necessary, rather than skip letters that they could not remember. No feedback was provided."

The <i>Speech hearing</i> subscale covers speech understanding in the presence of additional speakers (e.g., 'You are in conversation with one person in a room where there are many other people talking. Can you follow what the person you are talking to is saying?'), and is therefore directly relevant for our research question. The <i>Spatial hearing</i> subscale indexes the capability of locating static or moving sound sources (e.g., 'You are sitting around a table or at a meeting with several people. You can\u2019t see everyone. Can you tell where any person is as soon as they start speaking?'). The <i>Other qualities</i> subscale addresses aspects of segregation of sounds, recognition, clarity/naturalness, and listening effort. The SSQ response scales range from 0 to 10, and 10 represents the highest self-rated hearing ability. The mean ratings (with SDs in parentheses) on the Speech hearing, Spatial hearing, and Other qualities scale were 7.16 (1.43), 6.95 (1.39), and 7.82 (1.18), respectively. The SSQ total score, which can range between 0 and 30, varied between 12.5 and 29.4 (<i>M</i> = 21.9, SD = 3.6).

More specifically, the authors assess binaural sensitivity to temporal-fine-structure (TFS) information and the ability to focus attention in a large group of young audiometrically normal-hearing listeners, thereby extending and complementing previous work. Overall, this is a nice study in distinguishing between sensory and central contributions to individual differences that may affect everyday communication. The study is clear, well written, and of interest to the hearing-research community. We have three major issues that need to be addressed, along with some suggestions that might strengthen your presentation."

However, this may be very different from the ability to sustain focused attention. Indeed, different attentional control subnetworks are thought to control exogenous vs. endogenous attention; a whole host of processes (e.g., precise sensory coding, scene analysis, top-down selection, exogenous attention.) allow us to selectively understand a target and ignore maskers."

On a more general level, the Gau\u00df- Markov theorem states that the regression coefficients are unbiased even if there are correlations between predictors. However, multicollinearity could result in non-significant regression coefficients due to an increase in the standard error of the estimated regression coefficients. We consider it unlikely that this was a serious problem in our analyses, however, because there were only a few substantial pairwise correlations between predictors (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), and because the pairwise partial correlations (where multicollinearity cannot have affected the results) between the SRS and the predictors showed a significant correlation for only one predictor (SS<sub>Pcorr</sub>) for which the regression coefficient in the multiple regression was non-significant.
