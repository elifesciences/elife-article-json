It is an obligate intracellular parasite and invades erythrocytes where it grows in a relatively protected niche. Invasion of erythrocytes is essential for parasite survival and this involves interplay of multiple protein\u2013protein interactions. One of the most important interactions is binding of parasite invasion ligand families EBLs and PfRhs to host receptors on the surface of erythrocytes. PfRh5 is the only essential invasion ligand within the PfRh family and is an important vaccine candidate. PfRh5 binds the host receptor basigin. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of PfRh5 using diffraction data to 2.18 \u00c5 resolution. PfRh5 exhibits a novel fold, comprising nine mostly anti-parallel \u03b1-helices encasing an N-terminal \u03b2-hairpin, with the overall shape being an elliptical disk. This is the first three-dimensional structure determined for the PfRh family of proteins."

It is an obligate intracellular parasite and invades erythrocytes where it grows in a relatively protected niche. Invasion of erythrocytes is essential for parasite survival and this involves interplay of multiple protein\u2013protein interactions. One of the most important interactions is binding of parasite invasion ligand families EBLs and PfRhs to host receptors on the surface of erythrocytes. PfRh5 is the only essential invasion ligand within the PfRh family and is an important vaccine candidate. PfRh5 binds the host receptor basigin. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of PfRh5 using diffraction data to 2.18 \u00c5 resolution. PfRh5 exhibits a novel fold, comprising nine mostly anti-parallel \u03b1-helices encasing an N-terminal \u03b2-hairpin, with the overall shape being an elliptical disk. This is the first three-dimensional structure determined for the PfRh family of proteins."

After this period, the parasites break out of each infected liver cell, re-enter the bloodstream, and begin infecting red blood cells. When another mosquito bites the infected individual to feed on their blood, the parasite moves into the mosquito with the red blood cells and the cycle of infection continues."

Solving the structure of PfRh5 is the first step in understanding the role of this protein, and the other protein components, involved in invading red blood cells. These proteins are molecules that could potentially be used to vaccinate people against malaria, and understanding these proteins' functions will help efforts to design vaccines to prevent malarial disease."

In particular, PfRh5 is a much smaller protein (\u223c60 kDa compared to the average of \u223c300 kDa for the family) and lacks a transmembrane region. It forms a complex with the cysteine-rich protein PfRipr during merozoite invasion; the complex is peripherally associated with parasite membranes and is released at the apical end of the merozoite during invasion of the human erythrocyte (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2011</a>)."

PfRh5-C formed a stable complex with basigin as evidenced by size-exclusion chromatographic analysis. In these experiments, PfRh5-C was incubated with excess basigin and the stable PfRh5-basign complex eluted ahead of free PfRh5 and basigin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The stoichiometry of the complex was shown to be 1:1 by chemical cross-linking (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The binding affinity of the PfRh5-C\u2013basigin interaction was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to be <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> = 43.4 nM (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> value is higher than that previously reported (<a href=\"#bib10\">Crosnier et al., 2011</a>). We note that while the PfRh5 sample used for the SPR measurement was prepared in monomeric form by gel-filtration chromatography, it is possible that a dynamic equilibrium with oligomeric forms within the sample has contributed to the higher affinity measurement. Antibodies to the recombinant PfRh5-C block growth of 3D7 and W2mef strains of <i>P. falciparum</i> at levels comparable to previous studies (<a href=\"#bib11\">Douglas et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bustamante et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Douglas et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Reddy et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

Currently, there is no direct evidence that the PfRh5\u2013PfRipr complex is involved in transport of proteins or molecules across the erythrocyte membrane during invasion. Nevertheless, it is interesting that <i>P. falciparum</i> does inject proteins, including members of the RON complex, into the erythrocyte during merozoite invasion and these proteins are required for formation of the tight junction that bring the parasite membrane and host membrane together in a tight interaction through binding of RON2 to apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Narum et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Richard et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Riglar et al., 2011</a>).

In contrast, our work describes the structure of Rh5 not bound to the receptor basigin. Comparison of the Rh5 structure in the bound and unbound state shows that there are no changes in the core structure on binding of receptor. A pocket identified on the surface of PfRh5 may provide an opportunity for development of a new anti-malaria drug. Structural similarity with SipB has provided the tantalizing possibility that PfRh5\u2013PfRipr complex may play a similar role to the TTSS system of bacteria that secrete effector proteins into the host cell. However, further evidence will be required to support such speculation."

The pgpHFT-PfRh5 was then co-transfected with FlashBAC (Oxford Expression Technologies) into Sf21 insect cells as per supplier's manual. The seed virus was amplified to obtain high-titer viral stocks, which were then used to infect Hi5 cells grown in express Five SFM medium (Life Technologies Pty Ltd, Australia) supplemented with 1 mM glutamine. The supernatant containing the secreted recombinant protein was harvested, centrifuged, and passed over anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, Australia) column. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted from the column with the FLAG peptide at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml, concentrated and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 column (GL 10/300, GE Healthcare, Australia) in 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.5. For crystallization of PfRh5, the tandem 6xHis and FLAG tags were removed by digestion with a TEV protease and the pure protein was recovered by Ni-resin and/or size-exclusion chromatography purification. Human basigin isoform 2 (BSG-S) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Crosnier et al., 2011</a>) was also expressed in insect cells and purified as described for PfRh5."

The values of the I/sigI (0.52) and CC(1/2) (0.164) in the outer shell are well below what is generally considered acceptable (or recommended) limits (I/sigI &gt; 1 in conjunction with a CC1/2 of &gt; 0.5). Combined with the high Rmerge in the outer shell (530.8), we would question the selection of 2.2 Angstrom and argue that it is not likely to be that high. Can you justify the choice of resolution limit or do you need to modify the structure accordingly?"
