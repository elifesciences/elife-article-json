Here, we show that predatory interactions of a phage with an important environmentally transmitted pathogen, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, can modulate the evolutionary trajectory of this pathogen during the natural course of infection within individual patients. We analyzed geographically and temporally disparate cholera patient stool samples from Haiti and Bangladesh and found that phage predation can drive the genomic diversity of intra-patient <i>V. cholerae</i> populations. Intra-patient phage-sensitive and phage-resistant isolates were isogenic except for mutations conferring phage resistance, and moreover, phage-resistant <i>V. cholerae</i> populations were composed of a heterogeneous mix of many unique mutants. We also observed that phage predation can significantly alter the virulence potential of <i>V. cholerae</i> shed from cholera patients. We provide the first molecular evidence for predatory phage shaping microbial community structure during the natural course of infection in humans."

Here, we show that predatory interactions of a phage with an important environmentally transmitted pathogen, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, can modulate the evolutionary trajectory of this pathogen during the natural course of infection within individual patients. We analyzed geographically and temporally disparate cholera patient stool samples from Haiti and Bangladesh and found that phage predation can drive the genomic diversity of intra-patient <i>V. cholerae</i> populations. Intra-patient phage-sensitive and phage-resistant isolates were isogenic except for mutations conferring phage resistance, and moreover, phage-resistant <i>V. cholerae</i> populations were composed of a heterogeneous mix of many unique mutants. We also observed that phage predation can significantly alter the virulence potential of <i>V. cholerae</i> shed from cholera patients. We provide the first molecular evidence for predatory phage shaping microbial community structure during the natural course of infection in humans."

This perspective is being challenged with greater appreciation of the influence of the host's microbial ecosystem on these interactions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lozupone et al., 2012</a>). Bacteriophages influence bacterial populations in many ecosystems and specifically temperate phages play a role in many diseases through lysogenic conversion (<a href=\"#bib2\">Br\u00fcssow et al., 2004</a>). In contrast, the impact of lytic phage predation on bacterial pathogens in the context of human disease is under-appreciated. <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> is a water-borne pathogen responsible for the diarrheal disease cholera. In order for <i>V. cholerae</i> to colonize the human small intestine and elicit diarrhea, it produces a set of virulence determinants including cholera toxin (<a href=\"#bib12\">Herrington et al., 1988</a>). The ToxR signaling cascade activates expression of these virulence factors in response to host environmental stimuli (<a href=\"#bib21\">Miller et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Taylor et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">DiRita et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Childers and Klose, 2007</a>). Cholera epidemics appear with regular seasonality in regions like Bangladesh (<a href=\"#bib9\">Faruque et al., 2005</a>) and can arise unpredictably in vulnerable regions as exemplified by the epidemic that recently began in Haiti following the single-source introduction of a pandemic <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 strain from another continent (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cravioto et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Frerichs et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Katz et al., 2013</a>). Lytic phages are hypothesized to impact cholera disease burden in Bangladesh (<a href=\"#bib8\">Faruque et al., 2005</a>). The predation of <i>V. cholerae</i> by phages following their co-ingestion from the environment is central to this hypothesis; however, molecular evidence in support of this hypothesis is lacking."

To begin to address the geographic diversity of cholera phages in patient stools, we tested by plaque assay for the presence of phages within nine Haitian cholera patient stool samples collected in 2013. We identified one sample that had a high titer of phage (10<sup>8</sup> PFU/ml) relative to <i>V. cholerae</i> (10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml). Whole genome sequencing and comparative analysis of this phage, named ICP2_2013_A_Haiti, revealed 84% identity over 93% of its genome to ICP2_2011_A, a phage isolated from Bangladesh in 2011. An alignment of the annotated ICP2 genome (<a href=\"#bib27\">Seed et al., 2011</a>) with the three available ICP2-related isolates shows that synteny is conserved between these geographically distinct phages, with no significant genome rearrangements observed (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The Haitian ICP2 isolate is strikingly similar, although clearly distinct, from Bangladeshi ICP2 isolates, and is the first lytic phage reported to be associated with epidemic <i>V. cholerae</i> in Haiti."

We investigated phenotypic heterogeneity within this stool sample by testing 269 single colony isolates for sensitivity to ICP2_2013_A_Haiti and found that 267 (&gt;99%) were phage-resistant. Eight phage-resistant isolates and the two phage-sensitive isolates from this sample were subjected to whole genome sequencing. All 10 isolates were isogenic except for mutations within <i>ompU</i> encoding the major outer membrane porin (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Furthermore, the <i>ompU</i> mutations in the eight phage-resistant isolates were heterogeneous. We sequenced <i>ompU</i> from an additional 11 phage-resistant isolates from this stool sample and found a total of six unique <i>ompU</i> alleles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). When each of these alleles was used to replace <i>ompU</i> in a clean genetic background, all conferred resistance to ICP2, yet produced normal amounts of OmpU (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and data not shown), suggesting that ICP2 uses OmpU as a receptor to initiate infection and that the mutations disrupt this interaction. These data showing that intra-host <i>V. cholerae</i> isolates are isogenic, only differing in ICP2 resistance mutations, indicates that they diverged within the patient. Furthermore, the presence of multiple different ICP2 resistance mutations within this single host suggests that selection of phage resistance occurred multiple, independent times during the course of infection. We also found evidence for ICP2-mediated selection of OmpU mutants in isolates from Bangladesh. Analysis of the <i>ompU</i> sequence from 54 clinical isolates collected between 2001 and 2011 showed that 15% had non-synonomous mutations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and these alleles were sufficient for ICP2 resistance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). One of the OmpU mutants, G325D, was observed in clinical isolates from Haiti and Bangladesh (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Interestingly, seven of the eight mutant OmpU proteins detected in the Haitian and Bangladeshi clinical isolates had alterations in two predicted extracellular loops, while the eighth had an altered transmembrane segment adjacent to the first of these extracellular loops (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This suggests that ICP2 interacts specifically with these exposed loops to initiate infection."

Whole genome sequencing of two phage-sensitive and four phage-resistant isolates from this sample revealed that the strains were isogenic, except that phage-resistant isolates had nonsense mutations in <i>toxR</i>, the direct transcriptional activator of <i>ompU</i> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Crawford et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). We sequenced <i>toxR</i> from an additional eight phage-resistant isolates from this stool sample and found that, analogous to what was observed in the Haitian patient sample, there were multiple unique <i>toxR</i> alleles, which included two non-synonomous and two nonsense mutations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Each of the four mutant <i>toxR</i> alleles conferred ICP2 resistance and abrogated expression of OmpU when used to replace wild-type <i>toxR</i> in a clean genetic background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Both ICP2-sensitivity and OmpU expression were restored to the clinical <i>toxR</i> mutants by expressing <i>ompU in trans</i> or by reverting the <i>toxR</i> allele to wild-type (data not shown), indicating that these mutant <i>toxR</i> alleles are necessary and sufficient for ICP2 resistance and that this resistance is mediated through loss of OmpU expression."

Recent Tn-seq analyses of <i>V. cholerae</i> showed that OmpU is critical for fitness in an infant rabbit infection model (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Kamp et al., 2013</a>) and for dissemination from the host into pond water (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kamp et al., 2013</a>). OmpU has also been shown to be important for protection against the bactericidal effect of bile salts (<a href=\"#bib25\">Provenzano et al., 2001</a>), cationic peptides (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mathur and Waldor, 2004</a>), and intestinal organic acids (<a href=\"#bib19\">Merrell et al., 2001</a>). When we tested for survival in bile and for competitive fitness in pond water we found that the four OmpU mutants are fully fit (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), consistent with their wild-type levels of OmpU expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Moreover, the OmpU(G325D) mutant was fully virulent in a single round, competitive infection in infant rabbits (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, first column). However, the OmpU mutants, particularly the A195T and G325D mutants, showed a mild competitive defect after multiple passaging in growth medium (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The mild growth defect of the OmpU mutants in conjunction with the low prevalence of ICP2 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Seed et al., 2011</a>) may explain why the ICP2-resistant <i>ompU</i> variants do not become fixed in the population (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In sharp contrast, in the presence of ICP2 we observed a 10,000-fold enrichment of the OmpU(G325D) mutant over the wild-type after infection of infant rabbits (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), indicating that strong selective pressure is imposed by phage predation during <i>V. cholerae</i> infection. This emulates what we hypothesize happens in human infections in the presence of ICP2 and is the first demonstration of phage predation of <i>V. cholerae</i> in the context of a diarrheal disease model."

The clinical isolates containing these mutations were also at least 100-fold attenuated (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3D\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that these isolates do not harbor compensatory mutations. The cytoplasmic amino terminus (D17-E112) of ToxR where the two non-synonomous mutations mapped has homology to the winged helix-turn-helix family of transcription activators and is involved in DNA binding and transcriptional activation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Miller et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ottemann et al., 1992</a>). A number of point mutations in this domain were previously shown to abrogate activation of <i>ompU</i> and virulence genes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ottemann et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Morgan et al., 2011</a>). The severe virulence defects of the two non-synonomous <i>toxR</i> mutants from the Bangladeshi patient sample (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) are consistent with an inability of the encoded mutant ToxR proteins to activate these genes. These <i>toxR</i> mutants would not colonize the human small intestine and be recovered in the secretory diarrhea if ingested (<a href=\"#bib12\">Herrington et al., 1988</a>), which further supports our conclusion that these mutants arose due to ICP2 predation during cholera infection in this individual. This also indicates that, in this patient, predation and selection of phage-resistant mutants likely occurred late in infection when colonization and virulence gene expression were no longer required for the development of acute symptoms (<a href=\"#bib20\">Merrell et al., 2002</a>)."

They also establish that in a collection of 54 isolates of <i>V. cholerae</i>, 15% had an ompU mutation."

In addition, the toxR mutants have attenuated virulence, suggesting that the presence of the virulent phage may have contributed to the elimination of the infection by natural evolution. This is not true however for the ompU mutants that appear almost not attenuated in virulence/ survival phenotypes. The contrast between the two sets of mutants isolated is striking. As suggested by the authors, such an evolution, not reported until now for bacterial strains in healthy microbiota, may have taken place due to the disequilibrium of the resident microbiota in patients. This is a new concept, and the study certainly deserves publication."

The results of this analysis indicate that there is significant variability in OmpU, specifically in the predicted extracellular loops. As the reviewers point out, there are other <i>V. cholerae</i> isolates in GenBank that share the mutations identified in this study.

Trying to identify the source of these deposited sequences is not always possible. Since OmpU represents an abundant outer membrane protein it is not surprising to observe this variability, which as the reviewers point out, is likely due to many different causes. One could imagine that the variability may be due to immune pressure, or phage pressure from ICP2 and/or other uncharacterized phages. To-date ICP2 like phages have only been isolated from clinical samples in Haiti and Bangladesh and we do not know if they co-exist with environmental non-toxigenic <i>V. cholerae</i> in these locations, or for that matter anywhere else in the world. We feel that the analysis provided in this manuscript which is the analysis of over 50 clinical strains in Bangladesh collected over a 10 year period, which share a niche with ICP2, is particularly relevant to making conclusions about the selective force exerted by ICP2 over time. In addition, we were able to experimentally confirm our hypothesis that these mutations confer ICP2 resistance."
