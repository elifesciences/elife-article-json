Here, we reconstituted an autophagy-regulated secretion of mature IL-1\u03b2 (m-IL-1\u03b2) in non-macrophage cells. We found that cytoplasmic IL-1\u03b2 associates with the autophagosome and m-IL-1\u03b2 enters into the lumen of a vesicle intermediate but not into the cytoplasmic interior formed by engulfment of the autophagic membrane. In advance of secretion, m-IL-1\u03b2 appears to be translocated across a membrane in an event that may require m-IL-1\u03b2 to be unfolded or remain conformationally flexible and is dependent on two KFERQ-like motifs essential for the association of IL-1\u03b2 with HSP90. A vesicle, possibly a precursor of the phagophore, contains translocated m-IL-1\u03b2 and later turns into an autophagosome in which m-IL-1\u03b2 resides within the intermembrane space of the double-membrane structure. Completion of IL-1\u03b2 secretion requires Golgi reassembly and stacking proteins (GRASPs) and multi-vesicular body (MVB) formation."
