In turn, humans greet each other with handshakes, but the functional antecedents of this behavior remain unclear. To ask whether handshakes are used to sample conspecific social chemosignals, we covertly filmed 271 subjects within a structured greeting event either with or without a handshake. We found that humans often sniff their own hands, and selectively increase this behavior after handshake. After handshakes within gender, subjects increased sniffing of their own right shaking hand by more than 100%. In contrast, after handshakes across gender, subjects increased sniffing of their own left non-shaking hand by more than 100%. Tainting participants with unnoticed odors significantly altered the effects, thus verifying their olfactory nature. Thus, handshaking may functionally serve active yet subliminal social chemosignaling, which likely plays a large role in ongoing human behavior."

In turn, humans greet each other with handshakes, but the functional antecedents of this behavior remain unclear. To ask whether handshakes are used to sample conspecific social chemosignals, we covertly filmed 271 subjects within a structured greeting event either with or without a handshake. We found that humans often sniff their own hands, and selectively increase this behavior after handshake. After handshakes within gender, subjects increased sniffing of their own right shaking hand by more than 100%. In contrast, after handshakes across gender, subjects increased sniffing of their own left non-shaking hand by more than 100%. Tainting participants with unnoticed odors significantly altered the effects, thus verifying their olfactory nature. Thus, handshaking may functionally serve active yet subliminal social chemosignaling, which likely plays a large role in ongoing human behavior."

Similarly, there is mounting evidence for the role of social chemosignaling in ongoing human behavior (<a href=\"#bib30\">McClintock, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wysocki and Preti, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">de Groot et al., 2012</a>). Human social chemosignals drive menstrual synchrony (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stern and McClintock, 1998</a>), serve in mate selection (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jacob et al., 2002</a>), convey fear (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zhou and Chen, 2009</a>), drive pronounced hormonal (<a href=\"#bib35\">Preti et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wyart et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gelstein et al., 2011</a>) and behavioral (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jacob et al., 2001a</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bensafi et al., 2003</a>) modifications, and alter brain activity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sobel et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jacob et al., 2001b</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Savic et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lundstr\u00f6m et al., 2006</a>). Although there remains controversy on the statistics of menstrual synchrony (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schank, 2002</a>), and on application of the term <i>pheromone</i> to instances of social chemosignaling in humans (<a href=\"#bib32\">Meredith, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wysocki and Preti, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Doty, 2010</a>), that humans emit odors that can influence behavior and perception in other humans is largely agreed upon. Unlike other mammals, however, humans do not engage in overt olfactory sampling and investigation of conspecifics. Thus, how do humans obtain the social chemosignals they so clearly process? Although some human cultures include explicit olfactory sampling in stereotypical greeting behaviors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Classen, 1992</a>), and common behaviors such as hugging and kissing provide ample opportunity for covert olfactory sampling (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nicholson, 1984</a>), human overt olfactory sampling and investigation of unfamiliar individuals is largely a taboo. Here, we asked whether human handshaking might serve as a subliminal mechanism for sampling social chemosignals. Handshaking is common across cultures and history (<a href=\"#bib17\">Firth, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Schiffrin, 1974</a>), yet its functional antecedents remain unclear, and the commonly cited notion of gesturing no weapons in the shaking hand has only limited scholarly support."

To test whether the general type of molecules implicated in chemosignaling can also be transferred by handshake, we used gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry to sample surgical nitrile gloves before and after a handshake with the bare hand of 10 individuals (5F, mean age = 34.1 \u00b1 5.6 years) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Examination of the resulting chromatograms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) revealed several peaks that were all effectively transferred through handshake alone. These included previously identified compounds of interest in human bodily secretions (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gallagher et al., 2008</a>), such as squalene, which is a putative social chemosignaling component in several species including dogs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Apps et al., 2012</a>) and rats (<a href=\"#bib1\">Achiraman et al., 2011</a>); hexadecanoic acid, which is a putative social chemosignaling component in both mammals (<a href=\"#bib8\">Briand et al., 2004</a>) and insects (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tang et al., 1989</a>); and geranyl acetone, which is present in human secretions (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gallagher et al., 2008</a>), but to date was considered a social chemosignaling component in insects alone (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zarbin et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Each of these three compounds was transferred by handshake in all 10 of 10 subjects but not once in the control (all t[9] &gt; 3.9, all p &lt; 0.003). Use of cosmetics beyond hand-soap by these 10 subjects was minimal (2 subjects), and there was overlap in only one brand of hand-soap. We therefore submitted this hand-soap to GCMS analysis as well, and did not detect any traces of the three above components. Thus, we conclude that these were likely endogenous skin-bound molecules. These results do not imply that these molecules are necessarily social chemosignaling components in humans, but they do demonstrate that the act of handshaking is sufficient to transfer molecules of the type that are likely relevant to mammalian social chemosignaling."

Subjects who were invited to our lab for participation in experiments were first led to a room where they were requested to sit and wait. About 3 min later a cosmetics-free experimenter entered the room, introduced him/her-self using a fixed greeting text (20 \u00b1 8 s duration) either with or without a handshake and ended in telling the subject that they would soon return to start the experiment. These \u223c20 s are referred to from hereon as the \u2018greet\u2019. The subject was then again left alone in the room for an additional 3 min. The entire interaction was filmed with hidden cameras. Because human chemosignaling is influenced by gender (<a href=\"#bib37\">Savic et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bensafi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Radulescu and Mujica-Parodi, 2013</a>) (F/M), we aimed for \u223c20 subjects per each possible experimenter (exp) to subject (sub) gender interaction (Fexp/Fsub; Fexp/Msub; Mexp/Msub; Mexp/Fsub), and further interleaved experiments once with handshake and once without (baseline control), culminating in an intended \u223c160 subjects for analysis. We therefore recruited 175 subjects into this paradigm (84F, mean age = 26.49 \u00b1 3.69 years), who each shook hands with one of 20 different experimenters (13F, mean age = 35.24 \u00b1 6.38 years)."

The correlation between raters regarding duration of face-touches was r = 0.96, p &lt; 0.0001 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), implying that scoring the data using these strict criteria was largely uninfluenced by rater.

We then noted, however, that this analysis may be inappropriate, because in the 60 s post handshake, an experimenter was still in the room for about 20 s with variance across subjects. This variance introduced potential imbalance across subjects. For example, a subject with a 14 s greet was then alone for an added 46 s of observation, yet a subject with a 29 s greet was then alone for an added 31 s of observation. To account for this potential imbalance, we added for each subject his/her individual greet time (20 \u00b1 8 s) to each end (pre and post) of the observation. Thus, we end with \u223c80 s before and after the handshake event. The results of these two analyses (120 and \u223c160 s) were nearly identical (no effects lost or gained), with slightly stronger effects in analysis #1. We present analysis #2 in the manuscript."

Consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nicas and Best, 2008</a>), we observed that humans often bring their hands to their noses (see online <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Of 153 subjects, 85 (55.55%) touched their nose with their hand at least once during baseline before the greet. The average time of a hand at the nose across these \u223c80 s was 5.38 \u00b1 15.7 s for the right hand, and 12.33 \u00b1 23.81 s for the left hand. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that this left over right hand preference was significant (F[1,151] = 8.14, p = 0.005), and there was no difference across genders in this behavior (F[1,151] = 0.3, p = 0.86) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Combined, this amounts to \u223c17 s, in other words idle subjects had a hand (either right or left) at the vicinity of their nose for 22.14% of the time. To explore the spatial properties of this behavior, we parsed each face into 17 regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and coded the region-specific touching. This representation revealed that facial touching was mostly in regions at or under the nose, rendering the touching hand potentially well placed for olfactory exploration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

Although we think that the video data are strongly supportive of this view (see online <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), to further estimate whether bringing the hand to the nose is associated with olfactory exploration, we repeated the task in 33 additional subjects (26F, mean age = 23.84 \u00b1 5.36 years) with concurrent measurement of nasal airflow. To measure nasal airflow, we fitted subjects with a nasal cannula (<a href=\"#bib24\">Johnson et al., 2006</a>). To avert subject attention from any interest in nasal airflow, we also fitted them with several mock psychophysiology electrodes (e.g., ECG), and told them they were participating in an electrophysiology rig equipment calibration and testing procedure. Such tethered subjects behaved differently, reducing the prevalence of hand exploration from the previously observed \u223c22% of the time to \u223c11% of the time. Nevertheless, this generated a sufficient number of events for analysis (17 hand sampling subjects). We found that when a hand was at the vicinity of the nose, nasal airflow more than doubled over baseline (baseline flow = 112.75 \u00b1 75.56 ml/s, hand-at-face flow = 237.81 \u00b1 220.82 ml/s, t[16] = 2.37, p = 0.03) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) (online <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>).

We first computed for each hand a change score reflecting the time spent at the nose across \u223c80 s after the greet minus the time spent at the nose across \u223c80 s before the greet (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, sheet 1). In other words, positive values indicate an increase in hand exploration after the greet. Using change scores accounts for any individual differences in face touching. Next, from each change score, we subtracted the mean of the no-handshake control for that specific interaction (either Fexp/Fsub; Fexp/Msub; Mexp/Msub; Mexp/Fsub), such that for each subject we now have a change from condition-specific baseline (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Sheet 3) (note that we also replicate the analysis without this step, see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We then conducted a repeated measures omnibus ANOVA with factors of subject gender (M/F), experimenter gender (M/F), and a dependent repeated compact variable of exploration change time for right (shaking) and left (non-shaking) hands (hand). Moreover, we concurrently analyzed the data for each hand separately using non-parametric tests as well (see comment on statistics in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

In other words, individuals significantly increased right hand exploration following same gender greets that contained a handshake. These subjects (within gender with handshake) shifted in right shaking hand sampling from an expected \u22125.39 \u00b1 15.29 s (expected = change following no-handshake greet) to 2.14 \u00b1 8.1 s (change following handshake greet), that is, a 135.99% increase. In contrast, sampling of the left non-shaking hand decreased after shaking the hand of an individual from the same gender, yet increased after shaking the hand of an individual from the opposite gender (within gender = \u22124.86 \u00b1 17.5 s, across gender = 10.87 \u00b1 11.89 s, t[79] = 4.74, p &lt; 0.0001, non-parametric reanalysis: Mann\u2013Whitney U, Z = 5.62, p &lt; 0.0001) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These subjects (across gender with handshake) shifted in left non-shaking hand sampling from an expected \u22127.95 \u00b1 28.33 s (expected = change following no-handshake greet) to 2.91 \u00b1 11.84 s (change following handshake greet), that is, a 139.24% increase. Taken together, these data imply that after shaking hands with individuals from across gender humans increase left non-shaking hand sampling, yet after shaking hands with individuals of the same gender humans robustly selectively increase sampling of the hand that shook (see online <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Note that replicating the analysis without correcting for condition baseline generated the same outcome (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Again, to estimate whether these were touches allowing olfactory sampling, we analyzed the spatial distribution of touch. We found that the right hand increase in touching following within gender handshakes was directly at the vicinity of the nose (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). To further characterize this behavior, we also analyzed the latency to hand exploration. The average latency following greet onset in those subjects that explored the shaking hand was 25.65 \u00b1 16.48 s (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In order to include all subjects in the latency analysis (i.e., not only those that face-touched that are in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), we are forced to assign an arbitrary latency of 60 s + greet time (20 \u00b1 8) to subjects who never self-explored. Moreover, latency lacks a subject-specific baseline because we do not have a baseline event from which to measure it, so we can only calculate a condition-specific baseline. Finally, 14 subjects had their left non-shaking hand continuously at their nose before, during, and after the greet, and therefore we should not calculate latency for the left hand in these subjects. With these limitations in mind, we further analyzed the right shaking hand only. An ANOVA on latency change scores revealed a trend towards a main effect of experimenter gender (F[1,57] = 3.57, p = 0.06) reflecting that women experimenters trended towards eliciting faster sampling responses regardless of subject gender (change from condition-specific baseline, women experimenters = \u221214.27 \u00b1 29.72 s, men experimenters = 0.36 \u00b1 29.43 s, t[59] = 1.92, p &lt; 0.06). The analysis of latency revealed no significant effects beyond this trend."

The raw data for this analysis are in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, and the ANOVA table is in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>. We conducted a repeated measures omnibus analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors of subject gender (M/F), experimenter gender (M/F), and nature of greet (handshake/no-handshake), and a dependant repeated compact variable of exploration change time for right (shaking) and left (non-shaking) hands (hand). The ANOVA revealed no main effects or secondary interactions other than one highly significant interaction of subject gender \u00d7 experimenter gender \u00d7 greet \u00d7 hand (F[1,145] = 12.75, p = 0.0005). This reflected a gender \u00d7 experimenter gender \u00d7 greet interaction for the right shaking hand (F[1,145] = 9.46, p = 0.0025), whereby both men and women equally (F[1,152] = 1.06, p = 0.3) increased apparent olfactory right hand exploration after shaking the hand of a same gender individual (change after handshake greet = 2.14 \u00b1 8.1 s, change after no-handshake greet = \u22125.39 \u00b1 15.3 s, t[71] = 2.69, p = 0.009), but not the hand of an opposite gender individual (a trend in the opposite direction, towards decreasing hand exploration: change after handshake greet = \u22124.85 \u00b1 18.92 s, change after no-handshake greet = 0.94 \u00b1 5.58 s, t[78] = 1.84, p = 0.07). In other words, individuals significantly increased right hand exploration only following the same gender greets that contained a handshake. In contrast, for the left non-shaking hand, a gender \u00d7 experimenter gender \u00d7 greet interaction (F[1,145] = 5.14, p = 0.02) reflected mostly trends, which moreover were in the opposite direction from the right hand. Specifically, both men and women equally (F[1,145] = 0.53, p = 0.47) did not change left non-shaking hand exploration after shaking the hand of a same gender individual (change after handshake greet = \u22122.85 \u00b1 16.72 s, change after no-handshake greet = 1.64 \u00b1 22.08 s, t[71] = 0.99, p = 0.33), yet had higher left non-shaking hand exploration after shaking the hand of an opposite-gender individual (change after handshake greet = 2.91 \u00b1 11.84 s, change after no-handshake greet = \u22127.95 \u00b1 28.33 s, t[78] = 2.26, p = 0.03). Note that this latter effect was not driven by increases in sampling after the handshake greet (+2.9 s), but rather by avoiding self-sampling after no-handshake greet (\u22127.95 s). Taken together, these data imply that after greeting individuals across gender without a handshake, humans may increase left non-shaking hand exploration, yet after shaking hands with individuals of the same gender humans robustly selectively increase investigation of only the hand that shook."

Moreover, individual comparisons revealed that although two experimenters drove more ensuing exploration than others (both p &lt; 0.05), these differences did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Thus, although we speculate that some individuals may drive such effects more than others, the design of our study largely protected against such influence in the current results. A second potential source of individual variance is subject handedness. Consistent with population distribution, 15 of the 153 subjects and two of the 20 experimenters were left-handed. This retained four left-handed subjects in the \u2018with handshake within gender\u2019 condition, three of which (75%) increased investigation of the shaking hand (right) after handshake. This reflects a trend towards a stronger effect in left-handed subjects, but this difference is not statistically different from the remaining right-handed subjects (X<sup>2</sup> = 2.12, p = 0.14). Thus, here too our design protected against influence of individual differences such as handedness, and we cannot say whether handedness impacts this behavior."

To maintain a manageable scope, we now limited our effort to the \u2018within gender with handshake\u2019 condition in women alone. We added three experimental groups: one where women experimenters were tainted with the putative male social chemosignal 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Savic et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Huoviala and Rantala, 2013</a>) (n = 22), one where women experimenters were tainted with the putative female social chemosignal estra-1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Savic et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Huoviala and Rantala, 2013</a>) (n = 20), and one where women experimenters were tainted with a commercial unisex perfume (CK-be) (n = 21). We compared these data to the previous untainted \u2018within gender with handshake\u2019 condition in women (n = 22) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Sheet 5). Note that although our covert AND/EST tainting device was wrist-worn (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), it did not taint the shaking hand, and was designed to provide a general ambient subliminal body odor, much like wearing a perfume. In this analysis, each subject remains normalized to his/her own pre-greet baseline as before, but not further interaction-specific normalized (as in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is because, we did not collect a tainted no-handshake condition, which was here unnecessary because the critical comparison is of the same interaction, namely \u2018within gender with handshake\u2019 in women, just with taint or without. Our analysis addressed two hypotheses: chiefly, that odor would influence the behavior, and second that AND and EST would drive opposite effects in accordance with their hypothesized gender associations (<a href=\"#bib37\">Savic et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>). An ANOVA with factors of hand (L/R) and condition (AND/EST/CKB/clean) revealed no main effects, but a significant interaction of hand and condition (F[3,81] = 4.35, p &lt; 0.007) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Planned comparisons revealed that this reflected a decrease in self exploration of the shaking hand following tainting with the putative chemosignals compared to increased self exploration when no taint was used or after tainting with perfume (mean clean = 2.5 \u00b1 10.1 s, mean EST = \u22127.2 \u00b1 18.2, mean AND = \u22121.93 \u00b1 9.5, mean perfume = 5.29 \u00b1 13; clean vs EST: t[40] = 2.16, p = 0.04, perfume vs EST: t[39] = 2.53, p &lt; 0.02, perfume vs AND: t[41] = 2.1, p = 0.04. Non-parametric reanalysis: Mann\u2013Whitney U, clean vs EST Z = 1.97, p &lt; 0.05, perfume vs EST Z = 2.2, p &lt; 0.03). In contrast, a mirror image effect was evident in the non-shaking left hand. Here, there was an increase in self-exploration following tainting with putative chemosignals compared to a decrease when no taint was used and no change after tainting with perfume (mean clean = \u22125.7 \u00b1 17.8 s, mean EST = 4 \u00b1 8.8, mean AND = 2.47 \u00b1 16.42, mean perfume = \u22120.12 \u00b1 13.48; clean vs EST: t[40] = 2.2, p &lt; 0.04. Non-parametric reanalysis: Mann\u2013Whitney U, clean vs EST Z = 2.38, p &lt; 0.02, clean vs AND Z = 2.36, p &lt; 0.02) (Online <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a> final instance). In exit questionnaires administered following the EST and perfume controls, subjects were asked to provide a forced choice answer on whether an odor was present or not during the experiment. In the perfume condition, only 7 of 21 subjects noticed an odor (binomial cumulative P[X \u2265 7] = 0.96), and there was no difference in sampling behavior between those who did and did not notice an odor (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov, X<sup>2</sup> = 2.38, p = 0.6). Similarly, in the EST condition, only 4 of 20 subjects noticed an odor (Binomial cumulative P[X \u2265 4] = 0.99), and here too there was no difference in sampling behavior between those who did and did not notice an odor (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov, X<sup>2</sup> = 1.8, p = 0.81). Taken together, the first hypothesis materialized, and odors had a pronounced influence on the behavior of self-exploration after handshake. This influence remained consistent with the previously observed mirror behaviors of the left and right hands, and persisted despite lack of awareness for the odor manipulation. This strongly supports the subliminal olfactory nature of the behavior we measured. In contrast, the second hypothesis did not materialize, and there was no difference between AND and EST in this respect."

A striking aspect of these observations was the extent of apparent olfactory self-exploration: human subjects repeatedly investigated their own hands, and this was often accompanied by overt sniffing (see online <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Our analyses reveal that such sniffing of the right shaking hand significantly increased selectively following handshakes with same gender individuals, and we speculate that this reflects chemo-investigation of conspecifics. Note that sniffing of the right shaking hand also persisted following cross-gender handshakes, yet here it dropped to a level significantly below baseline. Thus, this finding implies that humans are not only passively exposed to social chemosignals, but rather actively search for them. This was further evident in the tainting experiment where putative chemosignals and an ordinary perfume drove opposite effects. However, whereas previous studies found that AND and EST can bias perceptions in a gender-specific manner (<a href=\"#bib37\">Savic et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>), here AND and EST drove similar effects within gender that were opposite to that of a standard perfume. Whether the common response profile to AND and EST observed in the current setting has any bearing on their consideration as chemosignals is unlikely. Moreover, this issue is off-topic of the current study, where the important aspect is that one type of unnoticed odor taint decreased the behavior (AND and EST) yet a different type of unnoticed odor taint (perfume) did not. In other words, the behavior we measured was indeed influenced by unnoticed odor."

Although popular depictions of social chemosignaling typically highlight cross-gender interactions, a large number of documented social chemosignaling effects in both rodents and humans highlight the role of within gender social chemosignaling as well. For example, in rodents the chemosignal-mediated suppression of estrus (<a href=\"#bib46\">Van Der Lee and Boot, 1955</a>) is a within gender effect. In humans, chemosignal-mediated menstrual synchrony (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stern and McClintock, 1998</a>) is also a within gender effect. Therefore, the strong within gender effects observed in this study are not inconsistent with chemosignaling behavior. In turn, we speculate that the particular pattern we observed, namely increased sampling within gender, may be strongly modulated by context. In other words, we can imagine settings where one would perhaps increase investigation of the opposite gender rather than the same gender. Therefore, we think that the important aspects of our results are that people often sniff their own hands, and that they change this behavior after handshake. The specifics of the change, whether increase or decrease within or across gender, may be more specific to this study alone. Finally on this front, several studies imply that human chemosignaling is not only gender-specific, but also sexual-orientation-specific (<a href=\"#bib38\">Savic et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Berglund et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lubke et al., 2012</a>). We did not collect sexual orientation data, and therefore cannot say if the current within gender increase is strictly gender-specific, or perhaps also related to sexual orientation. This joins several unknowns regarding our result. For example, does familiarity between individuals influence this behavior? Might the behavior significantly shift across contexts? Is this behavior compensated for in some way in cultures where handshake is not common? These and more remain open questions for continued investigation."

Given these effects, which we speculate are only the tip of the iceberg, humans likely evolved social chemosignal-sampling strategies (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arzi et al., 2014</a>), and we propose that handshaking is one of them. That said, we are not suggesting that social chemosignaling is the sole functional aspect of handshaking. Handshake orchestration conveys assorted social information (<a href=\"#bib17\">Firth, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Schiffrin, 1974</a>), contained within shake duration, posture, and strength (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chaplin et al., 2000</a>).

We speculate that this reflects an ongoing comparative process whereby sniffing of the left hand subserves self-recognition and sniffing of the right hand subserves the investigation of others. This notion of a comparative process, however, remains a speculation deserving further address. Therefore, we conclude with reiterating the major findings of this study: first and foremost, humans apparently often sniff their own hands. Moreover, in the current context, after within gender handshakes humans significantly increase investigation of the hand that shook. This investigation is concurrent with pronounced sniffing, slightly increased after tainting the greeting experimenter with a perfume, yet is negated after tainting the greeting experimenter with putative social chemosignals. This combination leads us to conclude that handshaking may subserve sampling of social chemosignals. In addition to providing a functional framework for a common human behavior, these results imply an extensive role for social chemosignaling, which persists mostly without awareness for the signaling process."

For the initial measurement of possible chemosignal transfer by handshake (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) we measured three handshakes, one on each of three consecutive days, by each of the 10 participants (i.e., total 30 handshakes). Because we wanted to measure near-natural conditions, we did not instruct subjects to wash their hands before measurement. Instead, we collected data on all use of cosmetics. One subject (F) used hand cream and one subject (M) used facial cream. Other than one brand of hand-soap used by several subjects, there was no overlap in use of any cosmetic across the 10 subjects. We therefore conducted GCMS analysis of this soap, and did not find traces of any of the three components that occurred consistently across subjects.

The Twister was desorbed in a Thermal desorption Unit (TDU, Gerstel GmbH, Germany), with a temperature ramp of 20\u00b0C\u2013170\u00b0C at 60\u00b0C/min, with a 5 min hold at maximum temperature. The Helium desorption flow was set at 40 ml/min in PTV solvent vent (1.2 min) and splitless TDU mode. The Programmable Temperature Vaporization Injector (PTV, Gerstel CIS4) was kept at \u221220\u00b0C through the desorption for trapping and focusing the transferred analytes on a quartz wool liner. Transfer line between the TDU and PTV was kept at 200\u00b0C. PTV temperature gradient was set to 12\u00b0C/s up to 250\u00b0C. Hold time at maximum temperature was 10 min. GC run was carried on an Agilent 7890 GC attached to an Agilent 5890 EI-single quadropole MSD. Restek Rxi-XLB 30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm medium polarity phase column was used. Oven program was 40\u00b0C for 3 min, then 15\u00b0C/min to 280\u00b0C for 5 min. Helium constant flow was at 1.2 ml/min. MS acquisition was carried out in TIC scan mode, 40\u2013400 AMU. All MS parameters were automatically tuned. All resulting chromatograms were integrated according to the same parameters, using Agilent Chemstation software integrator. Peaks were screened for those occurring differentially in the two conditions, blank Twister run was used to screen out artifacts. Peaks were identified using NIST08/Wiley09 combined spectra library, and some peaks were confirmed by retention times and spectra with commercially obtained standards (Lactic acid, Glycerol, Squalene)."

We clearly state here that the decision to score 1 min before and 1 min after the greeting event (which culminated at \u223c80 s given the added time of the greet event itself, see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), rather than some other time window, was an a priori decision and not the result of a fishing expedition for time windows. Because subjects who did not sample their hand both before and after the greet during this 1 min were scored at zero (0) change in duration, this rendered the data abnormally distributed (Skew = \u22122.46, Kurtosis = 11). Although an ANOVA is relatively insensitive to this at sample sizes such as these (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lix et al., 1996</a>), we nevertheless repeated each of the critical tests using a non-parametric approach as well (Mann\u2013Whitney U test). The non-parametric results were mostly in full agreement with the parametric results and are reported throughout the manuscript. Finally, for simplicity in presentation, we computed a change from condition-specific baseline for each subject. This step is sensitive to extreme values in the no-handshake condition baseline. Thus, we repeated the analysis after deleting the highest and lowest extreme in each baseline, and we again obtained the same results with a reduction in power from F(1,77) = 37.79, p &lt; 0.0001 to now F(1,77) = 24.93, p &lt; 0.0001. This reanalysis is presented in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, sheets 6\u20138. Finally, if we avoid condition-specific correction altogether and conduct the entire analysis with an additional \u2018Nature of Greet\u2019 level in the ANOVAs (with handshake/without handshake), the main results replicated in full, albeit with a slight further reduction in power to F(1,145) = 12.75, p &lt; 0.0005. This somewhat more complex to follow graph together with its associated statistics are presented in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>. Thus, the same result panned out when using baseline correction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), when using baseline correction without extreme values at baseline (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Sheets 6\u20138), when avoiding baseline correction (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and critically, when reverting to non-parametric statistics (text throughout the \u2018Results\u2019 section)."

Although the editor opened the door to us simply deleting these control studies, we opted to take the longer path of in fact bettering them along the lines of the concerns raised by the editor and referees, as we think this makes for a more powerful end result. Thus, this revision includes not only new analysis and wording based on referees\u2019 comments, but also new data from 50 additional subjects studied for this revision."

We omitted this data. In turn, we think that ascertaining that handshakes can transfer chemosignaling relevant molecules is important for our major claim. With this in mind, we now repeated this experiment, now in 10 subjects, each tested 3 times (i.e., total 30 handshakes). Moreover, we now collected and detailed the relevant information on background. Specifically, because we wanted to measure near-natural conditions, we did not instruct subjects to wash their hands before measurement. Instead, we collected data on all use of cosmetics. One subject (F) used hand cream and one subject (M) used facial cream. Other than one common type of hand-soap used by several subjects, there was no overlap in use of any cosmetic across the 10 subjects. We therefore conducted GCMS analysis of this soap, and did not find traces of any of the three components that occurred consistently across all 10 subjects. Thus, any component that transfers from handshake alone in all subjects cannot be attributed to a cosmetic source. Given that the molecules we identify have been identified before as produced on human skin, we conclude that these were likely endogenous skin-bound molecules. These results do not imply that these molecules are necessarily social chemosignaling components in humans, but they do demonstrate that the act of handshaking is sufficient to transfer molecules of the type that is relevant to mammalian social chemosignaling."

In turn, we think that demonstrating that odours influence the behaviour we observed is important if not critical. With that in mind, we studies an additional 40 subjects in order to balance AND and EST. We concentrated on women alone, and indeed also added a non-sex hormonal odour as an additional control. The end result of this was that both AND and EST reduced the behaviour equally, yet a standard perfume actually increased the behaviour (significantly above AND and EST, and nearly significantly above odourless baseline). This significant interaction (F(3,81) = 4.35, p &lt; 0.007) is a critical \u201cnail\u201d in this box, as it demonstrates that the effect is odour driven. In addition to these detailed statistics, we also added a subject from the tainting experiment to <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>. As to lack of difference between AND and EST, this has implications as to the profile of these two compounds, but we did not delve into this, as this manuscript is about chemosampling behaviour, not about AND and EST. Thus, we simply highlight that one set of odours reduced the behaviour and a different odour increased it. Hence, this is odour-driven behaviour. Importantly, we also added a post experimental exit questionnaire, and this revealed that subjects were unaware of the odour tainting. All this has been added to the manuscript."

Consistent with population distribution, 15 of the 153 subjects and two of the 20 experimenters were left-handed. This retained four left-handed subjects in the \u201cwith handshake within gender\u201d condition, three of which increased investigation of the shaking hand (right) after handshake. This reflects a trend towards a stronger effect in left-handed subjects, but this difference is not statistically different from the remaining right-handed subjects (X2 = 2.12, p = 0.14). Thus, here too our design protected against influence of individual differences such as handedness, and we cannot say whether handedness impacts this behaviour.
