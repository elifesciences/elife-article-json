These were oversights which occurred when the figure was being finalized (color scheme and labels applied). The size of the bar in question and the numbers shown in the bar are correct, as shown by comparison to the accompanying supplemental table. In the corrected figure, the color of this bar has been corrected and the missing label has been added."
