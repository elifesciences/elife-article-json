Using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, glutamate uncaging, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and transgenic mice expressing labeled PSD-95, we comparatively analyzed electrical and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in spines and shaft synapses of dopamine neurons. Dendritic spines were present on dopaminergic neurons at low densities in live and fixed tissue. Uncaging-evoked potential amplitudes correlated inversely with spine length but positively with the presence of PSD-95. Spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were less sensitive to hyperpolarization than shaft synapses, suggesting amplification of spine head voltages. Lastly, activating spines during pacemaking, we observed an unexpected enhancement of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> midway throughout the spike cycle, likely involving recruitment of NMDA receptors and voltage-gated conductances. These results demonstrate functionality of spines in dopamine neurons and reveal a novel modulation of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during pacemaking."

The connections formed directly onto dendrites usually have more influence on the neuron than those on spines. However, the size and shape of spines determines their properties. Most spines are attached to dendrites via a narrow neck, and spines with long necks have less influence on the electrical signaling of the cell than short-necked spines. This is because the neck limits the movement of electrical charges. Long-necked spines also possess fewer receptors for the chemical messenger glutamate, which reduces their ability to transmit signals arriving from other cells."

For example, the thin spine neck limits diffusion of signaling molecules from the spine head (<a href=\"#bib64\">Svoboda et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Tonnesen et al., 2014</a>), a feature critical for synapse specificity during plasticity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Harvey and Svoboda, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Yuste and Denk, 1995</a>). Furthermore, theoretical studies hypothesize that the resistance of the spine neck, if high relative to the impedance of the dendrite, may electrically compartmentalize synaptic potentials in the spine head (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jack et al., 1975</a>). As a result, the high neck resistance of spines can lead to passive amplification the voltage in the spine head, but also attenuation of signals as they travel across the spine neck (<a href=\"#bib3\">Araya, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sala and Segal, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Yuste, 2013</a>). Accordingly, long-necked spines may be expected to have higher neck resistances, producing strong attenuation of synaptic potentials. However, experimental evidence for this hypothesis has been less conclusive. Studies of cortical pyramidal cells show a clear negative correlation between neck length and EPSP amplitude (<a href=\"#bib1\">Araya et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">2014</a>), while studies in hippocampal pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib66\">Takasaki and Sabatini, 2014</a>) and olfactory granule neurons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bywalez et al., 2015</a>) observe either a weak relationship or none at all. Therefore, better knowledge of the relationship between spine geometry and synaptic function will forward our understanding of how synaptic input shapes neuronal excitability."

In other studies, spines were encountered only rarely (<a href=\"#bib31\">Juraska et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tepper et al., 1987</a>). While many of these studies provide important descriptions of spine density, quantitative analyses of the density of spines in SNc dopamine neurons have seldom been performed. Likewise, the function of spines on dopamine neurons is unclear. For example, high densities of vesicular monoamine transporters, dopamine transporters and dopamine D2-autoreceptors have been localized to spines (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gantz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nirenberg et al., 1996a</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">1996b</a>), which are\u00a0associated with the reuptake and storage of dopamine.

Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the functionality, chemical and electrical compartmentalization as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in short spines (&lt;2 \u00b5m), long spines (2\u20135 \u00b5m) and shaft synapses.

We demonstrate the presence of functional dendritic spines on SNc dopaminergic neurons and provide evidence that activation of spines during pacemaking leads to novel enhancement of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> that occurs periodically in a window starting at the middle phase and lasts throughout remainder of the spike cycle."

In Golgi-stained tissue (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), SNc dopamine neurons exhibited dendritic spines consistent with past experiments analyzing Golgi-stained SNc cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Juraska et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Phelps and Adinolfi, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rinvik and Grofova, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Schwyn and Fox, 1974</a>). To visualize dopamine neurons in tissue from fast transcardially-perfused mice, we used transgenic mice in which GFP is driven by the\u00a0tyrosine hydroxylase promoter and visualized their morphology using juxtacellular labeling with Alexa-594. Spines in fixed tissue were observed along the dendrites of SNc dopamine neurons, though at somewhat lower densities than in live tissue (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This raises the possibility that some spine growth in dopamine neurons may result from acute slicing. Alternatively, it has been suggested that tissue fixation may limit diffusion of fluorescent dye and visualization of spines (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2007</a>). Comparing cells from young (P15\u2013P25) and mature (P75\u2013P119) mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), we found no significant difference in the density of spines (young, 0.90 \u00b1 0.15 spines/10 \u00b5m, n\u00a0=\u00a016; mature, 0.75 \u00b1 0.13 spines/10 \u00b5m, n\u00a0=\u00a013; p=0.47). Therefore, we demonstrate that dendritic spines are present in live and fixed tissue preparations from both juvenile and adult mice, suggesting that dendritic spines are a common feature of mammalian SNc dopamine neurons."

Chemical compartmentalization by the spine, due to slower diffusion through the narrow spine neck, could result in greater spatial-specificity of cell signaling pathways in the spine head. Similarly, spine and shaft synapses could differ in synaptic strength due to attenuation of the EPSP by the resistance of the spine neck. Finally, the spine neck could produce local boosting of the EPSP within the spine head leading to activation of voltage-dependent ion channels that would not take place at shaft synapses."

Therefore, we tested electrical signaling in single spines of different lengths using glutamate uncaging. Much like the experiments examining synaptically-evoked responses, glutamate uncaging resulted in uncaging-evoked EPSPs (uEPSPs), clear Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the spine head, and a smaller, slowly rising Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in the parent dendrite (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014 figure\u00a0supplement 1</a>)."

However, we found clear differences in the amplitudes of uEPSPs. Glutamate uncaging generated a uEPSP of 0.91 mV in the shorter spine (1.55 \u00b5m) versus a uEPSP of 0.32 mV in the longer spine (4.15 \u00b5m).

Therefore, we estimated the volume of the spine head based on the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of Alexa-594 signal intensity across the spine head. Assuming that the spine head is a sphere with the FWHM as the diameter, we estimated that spine head volumes cover a range from 0.016 to 0.64 \u03bcm<sup>3</sup>. We found no correlation between the FRAP time constants and spine head volume (Pearson\u2019s R\u00a0=\u00a00.193, p=0.28). We next used estimates of the spine volume and FRAP measurements to calculate the resistance of the spine neck with Fick\u2019s law: R<sub>neck</sub>=tau<sub>FRAP</sub>D<sub>Alexa</sub>R<sub>axial</sub>/V<sub>head</sub>. In this equation, R<sub>neck</sub> is the neck resistance, tau<sub>FRAP</sub> is the time constant from FRAP measurements, D<sub>Alexa</sub> is the free diffusion time constant for Alexa-594 (120 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>/s), R<sub>axial</sub> is the axial resistance (150 \u03a9*cm), and V<sub>head</sub> is the volume of the spine head. Using these values, the estimated spine neck resistance ranged from 8.4 M\u03a9\u20131.3 G\u03a9, with a median of 72 M\u03a9. These estimates assume a spherical spine head as well as an intermediate value of cytoplasmic R<sub>axial</sub> of 150 \u03a9*cm, while values can range from 50\u2013250 \u03a9*cm. Despite the assumptions, however, our neck resistance values fall roughly in line with estimates from studies in other cell types (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tonnesen et al., 2014</a>)."

Plotting the uEPSP amplitude against the R<sub>neck</sub>, we found a moderate inverse correlation between uEPSP amplitude and R<sub>neck</sub> (Pearson\u2019s R\u00a0=\u00a0-0.503, p=0.0046) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>).

Comparisons of uEPSPs kinetics in long and short spines indirectly support this idea. We found significantly faster rise times in short spines than in longer spines (10\u201390% uEPSP rise time; short &lt;2 \u00b5m spines: 42.8 \u00b1 6.5 ms, long \u2265 2 \u00b5m spines: 71.9 \u00b1 10.4 ms; n\u00a0=\u00a045 and 26; p=0.023 student\u2019s unpaired t-test). Therefore, we hypothesized that the variability in the uEPSP amplitudes may result from distinct compositions of synaptic glutamate receptors in the short and long spines. To test this, we recorded glutamate uncaging-evoked AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated currents from short and long-necked spines by voltage clamping neurons to either \u221270 mV or +40 mV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>).

Therefore, it is possible that the observed difference in AMPA to NMDA ratio is due to greater filtering of AMPAR currents by the spine neck resistance of long spines. Measurements of synaptic charge transfer are less distorted by the cable properties of the neuron and spine neck than are measurements of current amplitude (<a href=\"#bib30\">Johnston and Wu, 1995</a>).Therefore, we examined the relationship between the AMPAR-mediated charge transfer (measured as the integral of the uncaging-evoked current at \u221270 mV) and the length of the spines (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

Measuring isolated AMPAR currents at different voltages allowed us to test the ohmic nature of the spine neck resistance because changes in synaptic conductance will be due the presence of the ligand alone. To measure the synaptic conductance in the absence of any spine neck resistance, we uncaged glutamate directly near the dendritic shaft. When holding the cell at \u221270 mV and targeting the dendritic shaft, uncaging-evoked synaptic currents were 1.60 \u00b1 0.05 times larger than the current measured at +40 mV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>).

We next compared the pixel intensity of mVenus at the position of uncaging with uEPSP amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>).

Regions of the dendrites, including the dendritic shaft and spines, were considered mVenus-positive when the green pixel intensity exceeded 2 standard deviations of the average green background intensity measured in the dendrite shaft. It is possible that small mVenus puncta could escape our detection, biasing our results to synapses with large postsynaptic densities. Using this criteria, we compared spines of similar lengths (&lt;2 \u03bcm) and found that uEPSPs were substantially larger for PSD-95 positive spines than for PSD-95 negative spines (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>) (PSD-95 positive uEPSP\u00a0=\u00a00.85 \u00b1 0.13 mV, n\u00a0=\u00a012; PSD-95 negative uEPSP=0.42 \u00b1 0.12 mV, n\u00a0=\u00a05; p=0.030).

Therefore, we first examined how steady-state changes in subthreshold potential (\u221275 to \u221245 mV) influence glutamate-evoked signals from spines as compared to shaft synapses (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Recordings were made in bath applied TTX (500 nM) and nifedipine (10 \u00b5M) to limit spontaneous membrane oscillations at depolarized potentials. In Purkinje neurons, T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels display greater expression within the spines than the dendrites (<a href=\"#bib27\">Isope et al., 2012</a>). While the sub-cellular distribution T-type channels has not been examined in dopamine neurons, differential expression in the spines and dendrites could influence the relationship between glutamate-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and membrane potential. Therefore, in a subset of experiments, T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels were blocked with TTA-P2 (1 \u00b5M). Results in the two conditions were similar, and therefore data was pooled (16 spines and 16 shaft synapses recorded with TTA-P2, 15 spines and 10 shaft synapses recorded without TTA-P2). Because of the large spine-to-spine variability in absolute Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), we normalized the amplitude of glutamate-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to those recorded at \u221245 mV within the same spine or shaft. This normalization will also account for possible differences in receptor expression between shafts and spines."

We also measured the impact of steady-state voltage changes on the amplitudes of uEPSPs for shaft versus spine synapses (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Here, we normalized the amplitudes of all uEPSPs to the amplitude measured at \u221275 mV, where the driving force of the synaptic current is largest. Between \u221255 to \u221250 mV, the average normalized amplitude of shaft uEPSPs was 0.71 \u00b1 0.03 (n\u00a0=\u00a049 measurements from 26 shafts).

This suggests that at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, NMDA receptors are more effectively recruited in spines relative to shaft synapses which we reason may occur through boosting of the voltage in the spine head."

We observe a much more dramatic influence of phase on glutamate-evoked spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals within our measured data (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). When glutamate uncaging occurred in the last third of the spike cycle, spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was 1.90 \u00b1 0.07 fold larger than Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx produced by uncaging alone. By contrast, linear summation of the AP-evoked and uncaging evoked signals during this same range of the spike cycle predicts signals just 1.28 \u00b1 0.04 fold larger than uncaging alone (measured data was significantly greater than linear sums, p=1.4e-9, n\u00a0=\u00a058 measurements from 20 spines). Action potentials immediately following synaptic activation are known to enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nevian and Sakmann, 2004</a>). However, we wanted to determine if the subthreshold voltage alone was sufficient to enhance glutamate-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. To isolate the effect of subthreshold voltage on spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we measured the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals before the onset of spikes and excluded Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals if spikes occurred &lt;100 ms after the uncaging pulse (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). Using this alternative measure, we observed dramatic enhancement of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the middle and late phases of the spike cycle (middle phase: measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> = 1.67 \u00b1 0.07, linear sum = 0.95 \u00b1 0.03, p=5.5e-12, n\u00a0=\u00a041 measurements from 20 spines; late phase: measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> = 1.64 \u00b1 0.07, linear sum = 0.85 \u00b1 0.04, p=2.7e-13, n\u00a0=\u00a036 measurements from 20 spines).Therefore, we find that glutamate-evoked spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in dopamine neurons is enhanced in a time window that occurs periodically during the natural pacemaker cycle."

In PSD-95 mVenus mice, spines were present at densities only slightly lower than shaft synapses. Importantly, electrical stimulation of presynaptic inputs resulted in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the spine head demonstrating that spines are innervated by terminals and act as functional sites of synaptic transmission. Testing individual spines with glutamate uncaging, we show that activation of long-necked spines results in small amplitude uEPSPs due in part to a lower AMPA/NMDA ratio and higher spine neck resistance. We demonstrate that stronger electrical compartmentalization in spines results in boosting of the spine voltage. Lastly, activating spines during tonic firing, we found that spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are dramatically enhanced during the middle phase of the interspike interval, independent of action potentials. This enhancement of spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> results from\u00a0strong recruitment of NMDA receptors and voltage-gated channels, likely due to boosting of the spine voltage. Therefore, these results show that in addition to shaft synapses, a meaningful source of excitation of SNc arrives via synaptic inputs onto dendritic spines."

For example, pyramidal neurons receive the vast majority (&gt;85%) of excitatory inputs onto spines (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kasthuri et al., 2015</a>) while dopamine neurons are unusual in that they receive inputs onto a mixture of shaft and spine synapses. The density of spines on dopamine neurons is considerably lower than pyramidal neurons (typically &gt;10 spines/10\u00a0\u03bcm) but similar to some GABAergic interneurons neurons of the hippocampus and cortex that have spine densities of 2\u20134 spines/10\u00a0\u03bcm (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kawaguchi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Scheuss and Bonhoeffer, 2014</a>). It also must be noted that unlike cortical and hippocampal neurons that receive mostly excitatory input, substantia nigra dopamine neurons function within a largely inhibitory network. Up to 70% of synaptic inputs that are received by the SNc dopamine neurons are inhibitory while a much smaller fraction of the synaptic inputs arrive from excitatory sources (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bolam and Smith, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Henny et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Smith et al., 1996</a>). This raises the possibility that the low density of dendritic spines on SNc dopamine neurons may simply reflect the low density of excitatory inputs overall. Consistent with this idea, we find that the ratio of spines to PSD95-mVenus positive shaft puncta is 4 to 5. Therefore, despite a low absolute density of spines on dopamine neurons, the relative density of shaft and spine synapses is comparable."

Most studies of spine function have examined pyramidal neurons that rest at hyperpolarized membrane potentials near -70 mV. However, during pacemaking in dopamine neurons, the interspike membrane potential covers a narrow but relatively depolarized subthreshold voltage range with an average non-spike voltage of ~-55 mV (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hage and Khaliq, 2015</a>). At these depolarized voltages, the membrane potential is within the steepest region of the voltage-activation curve of sodium channels, where even a\u00a0small amplification of the spine head EPSP may lead to significant sodium channel activation. In a clear demonstration of the relationship of EPSPs with voltage-gated sodium channels, <a href=\"#bib10\">Carter et al.

The extent of bleaching by the uncaging laser was consistent from spine to spine (fluorescence reduced by 34 \u00b1 2%), suggesting effective uncaging power was similar across experiments.

It would be helpful to see it in parts A and C. Previous work in this lab reported similar calcium boosting and an increase in transmission in dendrites during pacemaking. The significance of the present results is that the calcium boosting is statistically larger in the spines (compare F&amp;G; with I&amp;J;)."

The authors use FRAP measurements (proxy for chemical compartmentalization) to estimate spine neck resistance. In the FRAP example shown, 15-20% of the fluorescence signal does not recover, yet the authors fit this trace with a monoexponential function, that is not constrained to baseline fluorescence and report a tau of 30 ms. (This trace is better described with a double exponential, with the first time constant possibly reflecting diffusion of fluorophore within the spine and the second reflecting diffusion between the spine and dendrite.). If the fluorescence of an untethered molecule doesn't recover, there is a stronger barrier to diffusion than reported. How many of the data points are affected by this? Additionally, spine neck resistance is proportional to the length <i>cross sectional area</i> axial resistance. The spine neck diameter is going to have a much larger impact on resistance than length. Finally, the relationship that is most relevant, and least subject to assumptions based on unmeasurable physical features (at least with 2P) would be the FRAP versus uEPSP amplitude. A better experiment altogether would be to uncage (in a standardized way) on either side of the neck and measure a voltage dependent process in the spine head. This has been done by the Sabatini and Magee labs to good effect."

Specifically, are AMPA and NMDA electrical signals equally attenuated by the spine neck?"
