Here, we show by super-resolution photo-activated localization microscopy and edgetic mutations that the bitopic zinc-finger protein ZitP implements specialized developmental functions \u2013 pilus biogenesis and multifactorial swarming motility \u2013 while shaping distinct nanoscale (bi)polar architectures in the asymmetric model bacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. Polar assemblage and accumulation of ZitP and its effector protein CpaM are orchestrated in time and space by conserved components of the cell cycle circuitry that coordinate polar morphogenesis with cell cycle progression, and also act on the master cell cycle regulator CtrA. Thus, this novel class of potentially widespread multifunctional polarity regulators is deeply embedded in the cell cycle circuitry."

Here, we show by super-resolution photo-activated localization microscopy and edgetic mutations that the bitopic zinc-finger protein ZitP implements specialized developmental functions \u2013 pilus biogenesis and multifactorial swarming motility \u2013 while shaping distinct nanoscale (bi)polar architectures in the asymmetric model bacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>. Polar assemblage and accumulation of ZitP and its effector protein CpaM are orchestrated in time and space by conserved components of the cell cycle circuitry that coordinate polar morphogenesis with cell cycle progression, and also act on the master cell cycle regulator CtrA. Thus, this novel class of potentially widespread multifunctional polarity regulators is deeply embedded in the cell cycle circuitry."

In some cells, the asymmetry arises because a given protein accumulates at one side of the cell. In particular, this process happens before some cells divide to produce two non-identical daughter cells that then go on to develop in very different ways \u2013 which is vital for the development of almost all multicellular organisms. The single-celled bacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> also undergoes this type of asymmetric division. The polarized <i>Caulobacter</i> cell produces two very different offsprings \u2013 a stationary cell and a nomadic cell that swims using a propeller-like structure, called a flagellum, and has projections called pili on its surface."

Two such proteins are ZitP and CpaM, which appear to have multiple roles and are thought to interact with other factors that regulate cell division. However, little is known about how ZitP and CpaM become organized at the poles at the right time and how they interact with these regulators of cell division."

This revealed that ZitP accumulated via different pathways at the two poles and that it formed distinct structures at each pole. These structures were associated with different roles for ZitP. While ZitP recruited proteins, including CpaM, required for assembly of pili to one of the poles, it acted differently at the opposite pole."

Further experiments demonstrated that regulators of the cell division cycle influenced how ZitP and CpaM accumulated and behaved in cells, ensuring that the proteins carry out their roles at the correct time during division. These findings provide more evidence that proteins can have different roles at distinct sites within a cell, in this case at opposite poles of a cell. Future studies will be needed to determine whether this is seen in cells other than <i>Caulobacter</i> including more complex, non-bacterial cells."

The <i>Caulobacter</i> predivisional cell is overtly polarized and spawns two morphologically dissimilar and functionally specialized daughter cells, each manifesting characteristic polar appendages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The swarmer progeny is a motile and non-replicative dispersal cell that samples the environment in search of food. It harbours adhesive pili and a single flagellum at one pole and is microscopically discernible from the stalked cell progeny, a sessile and replicative cell that features a stalk, a cylindrical extension of the cell envelope, on one cell pole. While the stalked cell resides in S-phase, the swarmer cell is in a quiescent G1-like state from which it only exits concomitant with the differentiation into a stalked cell. During this G1\u2192S transition, the polar flagellum and pili of the swarmer cell are eliminated and replaced by the stalk that elaborates from the vacated cell pole. Upon sequential transcriptional activation of developmental factors during the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib48\">Panis et al., 2015</a>), the nascent stalked cell re-establishes polarization and ultimately gives rise to an asymmetric pre-divisional cell that yield a swarmer and a stalked progeny."

The <i>zitP</i> gene is predicted to encode a 311-residue bitopic trans-membrane (TM) protein harbouring a CXXC-(X)<sub>19</sub>-CXXC motif that binds a zinc ion (zinc_ribbon_5 or PF13719 superfamily, residues 1-37) at the cytoplasmic N-terminus (<a href=\"#bib1\">Berg\u00e9 et al., 2016</a>) and a conserved domain-of-unknown function (DUF3426, residues 128-245) in the C-terminal region that is predicted to reside in the periplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

The \u03c6CbK adsorption kinetics of the mutants closely resemble those for \u0394<i>cpaC</i> cells that cannot assemble pili because they lack the CpaC secretin (<a href=\"#bib58\">Skerker and Shapiro, 2000</a>). Moreover, immunoblotting revealed that \u0394<i>zitP</i> and \u0394<i>cpaM</i> cells do not accumulate the modified form of CpaC, CpaC* (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D</a>). A comparable reduction in CpaC* abundance has been previously reported for \u0394<i>cpaE,</i> \u0394<i>podJ</i> and \u0394<i>pleA</i> cells that no longer assemble a polar CpaC pilus channel in the outer membrane and cannot be infected by \u03c6CbK (<a href=\"#bib63\">Viollier and Shapiro, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Viollier et al., 2002b</a>). However, CpaC* accumulates in \u0394<i>pilA</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), suggesting that the CpaC channel forms independently of PilA. To test whether \u0394<i>zitP</i> and \u0394<i>cpaM</i> cells assemble a pilus filament on the cell surface, we conducted shearing assays followed by immunoblotting using antibodies to the PilA pilin, the subunit of the pilus filament (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Skerker and Shapiro, 2000</a>). Whereas PilA was efficiently released from <i>WT</i> cells into the supernatant by shearing, no PilA was detectable in the supernatants of \u0394<i>cpaE</i>, \u0394<i>zitP</i> and \u0394<i>cpaM</i> cells after shearing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), even though PilA is clearly expressed in these cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). As the major subunit of the flagellar filament, the FljK flagellin, accumulates in the supernatants in all samples (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), we conclude that ZitP and CpaM are required for the presentation of PilA on the cell surface and, as shown below, that they act in the same pathway (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

This hypothesis is based on the comparison of the \u03c6CbK adsorption kinetics to <i>WT</i>, \u0394<i>pilA</i> and \u0394<i>fljx6</i> (lacking all six flagellin genes: <i>fljJ/K/L/M/N/O</i>) cells to \u0394<i>zitP</i> and \u0394<i>cpaM</i> cells. While pililess \u0394<i>pilA</i> cells assemble a flagellum and are motile (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), \u0394<i>fljx6</i> cells are flagellumless, but piliated (\u03c6CbK sensitive) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guerrero-Ferreira et al., 2011</a>). The kinetics of adsorption of \u03c6CbK to \u0394<i>zitP</i> and \u0394<i>cpaM</i> cells was strongly reduced compared to <i>WT</i>, fitting halfway between the adsorption curves of \u03c6CbK to \u0394<i>pilA</i> and \u0394<i>fljx6</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Since it is known that \u03c6CbK first reversibly adsorbs to the flagellar filament rotating counter-clockwise, before the irreversibly attachment to the pilus portal is established for productive infection (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guerrero-Ferreira et al., 2011</a>), we wondered whether there are fewer motile cells in the \u0394<i>zitP</i> and \u0394<i>cpaM</i> populations than in <i>WT</i> or if motility in these mutants is altered in other ways. In fact, motility tests on swarm (0.3%) agar revealed a mild reduction in motility of \u0394<i>cpaM</i> cells and a severe reduction of \u0394<i>zitP</i> cells compared to <i>WT</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). However, \u0394<i>zitP</i> cells still have residual motility that allows them to spread in swarm agar compared to \u0394<i>fljx6</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Expression of Dendra2-ZitP from an ectopic locus confers near WT motility to \u0394<i>zitP</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), showing that this deficiency in motility is indeed due to the absence of ZitP."

To test if ZitP controls the G1 cell number, we used flow cytometry to quantify the number of G1 cells and indeed observed fewer G1 cells in the \u0394<i>zitP</i> population compared to <i>WT</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Knowing that the master cell cycle transcriptional regulator CtrA retains cells in G1-phase and activates many cell cycle-regulated promoters that fire in G1-phase (<a href=\"#bib15\">Domian et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fumeaux et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Quon et al., 1996</a>), we then conducted promoter-probe assays using several CtrA-activated promoters fused to the promoterless <i>lacZ</i> gene and quantified CtrA-dependent promoter activity in <i>WT</i> and \u0394<i>zitP</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While all such promoter-probe reporters for the CtrA regulon exhibited a decrease in activity by 30-40% in \u0394<i>zitP</i> versus <i>WT</i> cells, promoter-probe reporters for the GcrA regulon or other reporters were unaffected.

Second, we were able to mitigate the defect in CtrA-dependent transcription by ectopic expression of the (p)ppGpp alarmone, a signalling molecule that enhances CtrA function and stability via a poorly understood mechanism (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gonzalez and Collier, 2014</a>). We accomplished this by heterologously expressing the truncated version of the <i>E. coli</i> (p)ppGpp-synthase RelA (RelA\u2019) from the xylose-inducible promoter at the <i>xylX</i> locus in <i>WT</i> and \u0394<i>zitP</i> cells. LacZ-based promoter-probe assays revealed that ectopic induction of (p)ppGpp restores CtrA-dependent promoter activity to near WT levels (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

Quantification of the 2D area and shape-based analyses (circularity, solidity and eccentricity) showed that ZitP clusters extending into the base of the stalk are significantly larger and differently shaped than the extended fluorescent foci lining the cap of the opposite (swarmer) pole (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and D</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A, C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s5\">5A\u2013D</a>). In further support of the existence of two distinct nanostructures of ZitP at each pole, genetic experiments revealed that different pathways govern ZitP polarization: one requiring PopZ and another operating independently of PopZ. Imaging of Dendra2-ZitP in \u0394<i>popZ</i> cells revealed mainly monopolar foci (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and F</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2C</a>), resembling those seen at the pole opposite the stalk in <i>WT</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and D</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s5\">5C\u2013D</a>). Quantitative analysis of the polar residence time using stroboscopic single particle tracking PALM (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gebhardt et al., 2013</a>) revealed a strong reduction in polar binding times of Dendra2-ZitP in \u0394<i>popZ</i> compared to that of <i>WT</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6A\u2013D</a>).

A similar reduction in CtrA-dependent transcription occurs in \u2206<i>zitP</i> cells that are unable to localize CpaM.

It is therefore conceivable that ZitP also affects motility indirectly from the stalked pole, possibly via cell cycle regulation, flagellar performance and/or polarity. The fact that the motility defect of \u2206<i>zitP</i> cells can be restored by compensatory mutations in a switch component (FliG) of the flagellar motor (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kojima and Blair, 2004</a>), suggests that flagellar performance, reversals or timing (i.e. the length of flagellation in the cell cycle) could be altered by the \u2206<i>zitP</i> mutation."

The agarose pad was mounted in a silicone gasket (Grace Biolabs 103280) sandwiched between two microscope coverslips to minimize shrinkage of the agarose.

Fluorescent proteins were excited at 560 nm, and photoactivation was induced at 405 nm at ~ 0\u201316 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. For PALM images of Dendra2-ZitP in <i>C. crescentus</i>, cells were imaged at an exposure time of 10 milliseconds for 10,000 frames, and an excitation intensity of ~4 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>. For stroboscopic single particle tracking PALM measurement of ZitP binding time, cells were imaged at an exposure time of 30 milliseconds, with a variable interval between each frame, at an excitation intensity of ~1 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>. PALM localizations were accumulated in a 2D histogram; the resulting image was blurred with a 2D Gaussian of radius 15 nm to reflect the localization uncertainty of the measurement. The image was gamma adjusted to 0.5 to compensate for the large dynamic range of the image, and the \u2018Red Hot\u2019 ImageJ colormap was applied."

We performed non-linear least squares fitting of the raw \u03c4<sub>eff</sub> data directly to <a href=\"#equ3\">Eq. 3</a>, instead of calculating the quantity \u03c4<sub>tl</sub>/\u03c4<sub>eff</sub> and performing a linear fit as proposed by Gebhardt and coworkers (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gebhardt et al., 2013</a>), since the inverse transform proposed results in a non-linear transformation of the sample error distribution incompatible with least squares fitting. We observed that for stroboscopic illumination times significantly greater than the binding time, the data appeared to transition from the hyperbolic relationship predicted by <a href=\"#equ3\">Eq. 3</a> to a zero-gradient plateau (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6B</a>), giving very poor fits between <a href=\"#equ3\">Eq 3</a> and the data, especially for the \u0394<i>popZ</i> strain which appeared to have a shorter Dendra2-ZitP binding lifetime (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6B</a>). We hypothesized that this was due to an inability to accurately estimate effective on-time when molecules bind and unbind in a time significantly less than the duration of a single strobing interval (since the observed track length will almost always equal 1 frame). We confirmed this hypothesis by performing the stroboscopic tracking analysis on simulated data (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6C</a>). We simulated timetraces of molecules binding/unbinding with finite bleaching lifetimes, and measured the observed on-time for each simulated molecule by fitting a single exponential to the on-time histogram as above. We observed as hypothesized\u00a0that the observed off-times showed a sharp plateau for long-strobe intervals due to the finite integration time of the measurement, giving a poor fit of <a href=\"#equ3\">Eq 3</a> to the data (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6C</a>).

This is because insufficient localizations of individual molecules could be collected for the binding time analysis on a per-pole basis due to the long frame intervals (seconds) required, and thus the difficulty of knowing which pole is which when examining a few single molecules for a long period. By contrast for the shape-based analysis, many localizations for separate poles could be acquired due to the high frame rate (15ms)."

We also significantly enriched the manuscript with data and discussion about the multifactorial (indirect) effects of ZitP on motility. In <i>Caulobacter</i>, motility is a multi-step and coordinated process that relies on direct (flagellum biogenesis, chemotaxis) and indirect (cytokinesis, DNA replication/segregation, polarity and cell cycle) events. We now show that the motility can be restored by compensatory mutations in the flagellar motor, suggesting that flagellar performance, reversal or length of flagellation in the cell cycle is altered. Indeed we observed a decrease in CtrA- (but not GcrA-)dependent promoters in \u25b3<i>zitP</i> cells versus WT(<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), a defect that is also seen in \u25b3<i>cpaM</i> cells. However, as \u25b3<i>cpaM</i> cells only exhibit a mild motility defect compared to \u25b3<i>zitP</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), the reduced CtrA-dependent transcription only contributes in minor fashion to motility. Indeed, when the CtrA-defect in \u25b3<i>zitP</i> is corrected by ectopic expression of (p)ppGpp, motility is mildly improved but still clearly discernible (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We reason that there is another unknown role of ZitP to motility and that this could involve by the role of ZitP in regulating the localization of the polar matrix protein PopZ as described in the companion paper (Berg\u00e9 et al., submitted to <i>eLife,</i> 2016).

We localized ZitP (or CpaM) in all polar factor mutants inventoried in <i>Caulobacter</i> (unpublished data) but we did not find the extrinsic determinant that targets ZitP (and so CpaM) to the swarmer pole.
