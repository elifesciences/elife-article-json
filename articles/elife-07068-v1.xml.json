Although inhibitors targeting the membrane protein Smoothened suppress Hh signaling, acquired drug resistance and tumor relapse call for additional therapeutic targets. Here we show that phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) acts downstream of Neuropilins to control Hh transduction and medulloblastoma growth. PDE4D interacts directly with Neuropilins, positive regulators of Hh pathway. The Neuropilin ligand Semaphorin3 enhances this interaction, promoting PDE4D translocation to the plasma membrane and cAMP degradation. The consequent inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) enhances Hh transduction. In the developing cerebellum, genetic removal of Neuropilins reduces Hh signaling activity and suppresses proliferation of granule neuron precursors. In mouse medulloblastoma allografts, PDE4D inhibitors suppress Hh transduction and inhibit tumor growth. Our findings reveal a new regulatory mechanism of Hh transduction, and highlight PDE4D as a promising target to treat Hh-related tumors."

Although inhibitors targeting the membrane protein Smoothened suppress Hh signaling, acquired drug resistance and tumor relapse call for additional therapeutic targets. Here we show that phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) acts downstream of Neuropilins to control Hh transduction and medulloblastoma growth. PDE4D interacts directly with Neuropilins, positive regulators of Hh pathway. The Neuropilin ligand Semaphorin3 enhances this interaction, promoting PDE4D translocation to the plasma membrane and cAMP degradation. The consequent inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) enhances Hh transduction. In the developing cerebellum, genetic removal of Neuropilins reduces Hh signaling activity and suppresses proliferation of granule neuron precursors. In mouse medulloblastoma allografts, PDE4D inhibitors suppress Hh transduction and inhibit tumor growth. Our findings reveal a new regulatory mechanism of Hh transduction, and highlight PDE4D as a promising target to treat Hh-related tumors."

Hh signaling is transduced through a series of negative regulatory interactions. Binding of a Hh ligand such as Sonic hedgehog (Shh) to its receptor Patched (Ptch) releases Ptch inhibition of Smoothened (Smo). Activated Smo then triggers a signaling cascade that eventually activates Gli transcription factors, which enable Hh target gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib10\">Briscoe and Therond, 2013</a>). Abnormalities in Hh signaling are responsible for certain birth defects and contribute to a wide range of tumors, including medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor (<a href=\"#bib53\">Taylor et al., 2012</a>). For example, the loss of the negative regulator Ptch, causes Smo to be inappropriately active, and this leads to skin cancer and MB (<a href=\"#bib30\">Johnson et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Stone et al., 1996</a>)."

The Smo inhibitor, vismodegib, is the only FDA-approved drug that targets the Hh pathway. However, the effect of vismodegib tends to be transient, and irreversible drug resistance and tumor relapse often ensue (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rudin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yauch et al., 2009</a>). Genomic sequencing results showed that the resistance is due to mutations in Smo that reduce its binding affinity to vismodegib, or cause Smo to be constitutively active in tumor cells. Thus novel drug targets downstream of Smo are critically needed. We previously discovered that Neuropilins (Nrp1&amp;2) positively regulate Hh transduction downstream of Smo (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hillman et al., 2011</a>). Nrps are co-receptors for Semaphorin 3 (Sema3) in axon guidance (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Appleton et al., 2007</a>), and for VEGF that controls cardiovascular development and angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pellet-Many et al., 2008</a>). Nrps are also widely involved in many types of cancers. In particular, they are implicated in the growth and spread of MB (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hayden Gephart et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Snuderl et al., 2013</a>). However, how Nrps regulate Hh transduction at the molecular level remains unknown, which limits our understanding of developmental signal integration and hampers the development of Nrp-related therapeutics for Hh-related tumors."

One way that Nrps can affect tumor growth is by facilitating VEGF-driven vascularization events that prevent tumor suffocation. However, several lines of evidence suggest that Nrps promote tumor growth through mechanisms in addition to VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. Abolishing Nrp function in tumor cells using function-blocking antibodies suffices to suppress MB growth and metastasis (<a href=\"#bib49\">Snuderl et al., 2013</a>). Selective inhibition of Nrp function by RNAi specifically in MB tumor cells, that is not in vasculature, blocks growth of MB allografts (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hayden Gephart et al., 2013</a>). However, despite extensive research on each pathway, it remains unclear whether and how Nrps interact with Hh pathways to control GNP proliferation and MB formation."

We found that Sema3, a member of a secreted ligand family, enhances Hh signaling. This is achieved by activation of Phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), which reduces intracellular cAMP levels through hydrolysis. The subsequent inhibition of Protein Kinase A (PKA) activity promotes Hh transduction. We demonstrate that this molecular interplay operates in the developing cerebellum. Genetic removal of Sema3/Nrp signaling severely impairs GNP proliferation. Furthermore, inhibiting PDE4D suppresses the growth of Hh-related MB. These findings reveal a hitherto unknown transduction mechanism that links Sema3/Nrp signaling with Hh pathway, 2 major pathways in development and disease, and highlight PDE4D as a new therapeutic target for Hh-related tumors."

Little is known about the function of the Nrp cytoplasmic domain, though it is evolutionarily conserved. To identify which domain of Nrps is required to promote Hh transduction, we silenced endogenous Nrps in NIH3T3 cells with lentivirus-mediated RNAi and over-expressed truncated Nrp1 to rescue the Hh signaling. We found that both extracellular and cytoplasmic domains are required to promote Hh signaling, since Nrp mutants without either domain were expressed stably but failed to rescue Hh transduction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). At the extracellular side, A1/A2 domains are required for Nrps to enhance Hh transduction, whereas B1/B2 domains are dispensable (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

We treated NIH3T3 cells with Sema3A or 3F, two well-characterized ligands for Nrp1 and 2, respectively. An increasing concentration of Shh was used to induce Hh target gene (<i>Gli1</i>) expression. Both Sema3A and 3F dramatically enhanced Shh-induced transcription of <i>Gli1</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The most prominent amplification of Shh response was seen when Sema3F was added to cells in the presence of a high concentration of Shh (2 \u03bcg/ml). Sema3A and 3F were not able to induce <i>Gli1</i> expression in the absence of Shh. Three other Sema3 isoforms, 3B, 3C and 3E, had similar effects (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Similar results were obtained when <i>Gli1</i> was induced by SAG, a small molecule that binds directly to Smo and triggers target gene expression (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Together, these results demonstrate that activities of proteins in the Sema3 family contribute to Hh transduction. Since a single isoform of the Sema3 family is able to promote Hh transduction, blocking all Sema3 isoforms may be necessary in order to fully compromise Hh signaling. We performed such experiments by silencing both Nrps and by employing antibodies that block the Sema3-Nrp interaction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>). Future studies using genetic approaches (e.g., genetic knockdown or knockout) to lower multiple Sema3 ligands will be required to further define the role of Sema3 proteins in enhancing Hh signaling. In our previous study, using NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with a Gli-responsive luciferase reporter (Shh-Light2 cells), we did not find a noticeable effect of Sema3A on Hh transduction (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hillman et al., 2011</a>). In the current study, we used unmodified NIH3T3 cells and new batches of recombinant Sema3, and employed a more sensitive method (qPCR) to detect Hh signal activity. With this approach we detected robust Sema3-mediated enhancement of Hh signaling."

We also detected the expression of other Sema3 isoforms by next generation RNA sequencing (data not shown). It is likely that these endogenous Sema3 contribute to the baseline level of Hh transduction. To block the binding of the endogenous Sema3 with Nrps, we used function-blocking antibodies that specifically blocked ligand-binding sites in Nrps. The antibody Nrp<sup>panA</sup> occupies Sema3's binding site in both Nrp1 and Nrp2; antibodies Nrp<sup>1B</sup> and Nrp<sup>2B</sup> occupy VEGF's binding sites in Nrp1 and Nrp2, respectively (<a href=\"#bib2\">Appleton et al., 2007</a>). These antibodies were previously used to block tumor growth by interfering with tumor vascularization (<a href=\"#bib36\">Liang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pan et al., 2007</a>). We treated NIH3T3 cells with each antibody together with Shh or SAG.

To discover how the cytoplasmic domains of Nrps may operate in the Hh pathway, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using the Nrp1 cytoplasmic domain as the \u2018bait\u2019. Phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) emerged multiple times from the screen. PDE4D belongs to the superfamily of PDE4, enzymes that degrade the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP). Multiple isoforms of PDE4D with distinct molecular weights are generated through alternative RNA splicing (<a href=\"#bib46\">Richter et al., 2005</a>). We detected three main isoforms expressed in NIH3T3 cells: PDE4D2/6 (68KD), PDE4D1 (78KD) and PDE4D4 (110KD) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We then used co-immunoprecipitation to determine whether the interaction between Nrp1 and PDE4D observed in yeast is indicative of an interaction in NIH3T3 cells. We found that Nrp1 interacted with PDE4D, in particular the isoform PDE4D2/6 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

We tested this hypothesis by subcellular fractionation, examining the intensity of PDE4D2/6 in the cytosolic and membrane fractions. 30 min after cells were treated with Sema3F, the amount of PDE4D2/6 in the membrane fraction increased significantly, while the amount in the cytosolic fraction decreased slightly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a>).

                                "text": "cAMP activates multiple protein effectors in the cell, such as PKA, Epac, and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bradley et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Borland et al., 2009</a>). PKA is a well-known negative regulator of the Hh pathway. Genetic removal of PKA leads to full activation of the Hh pathway in the developing neural tube (<a href=\"#bib17\">Epstein et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tuson et al., 2011</a>). The lowering of intracellular cAMP by Sema3F-Nrp signaling has the potential to inhibit PKA, so we examined PKA activity in NIH3T3 cells. Previous publications suggest that phosphorylation of PKA at T197 is essential for PKA activity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Steichen et al., 2010</a>), and that the level of phosphorylation of PKA at T197 correlates with PKA activation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Moore et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barzi et al., 2010</a>). Thus, we used an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylation of PKA at T197 (pPKA-T197) and performed immunofluorescence. In agreement with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barzi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tuson et al., 2011</a>), phospho-PKA-T197 accumulates at the centrosome, and is distributed throughout the entire cytoplasm in a punctate pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Sema3F treatment for 30 min dramatically reduced the pPKA-T197 level in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The pool of PKA at the cilium base, marked by Pericentrin antibody, also went down (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>); this pool of PKA has been hypothesized to directly participate in Hh regulation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barzi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tuson et al., 2011</a>). To determine whether the reduction in pPKA-T197 level is due to decreased total PKA, we stained the cells with an antibody that detects total PKA. Sema3F did not induce any change in total PKA level in the cytoplasm or at the centrosome (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Therefore, Sema3F reduced the detectable level of PKA phosphorylation at T197. This effect was dependent on the presence of Nrps, since Sema3F did not reduce pPKA-T197 after <i>Nrp</i> expression was silenced by lentivirus-mediated RNAi (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013E</a>), and the total PKA level remained unchanged (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>)."

This model indicates that inhibiting PDE4D will suppress Hh transduction. To test this idea we treated cells with rolipram, which inhibits all PDE4 families; GEBR-7b, which specifically inhibits the PDE4D subfamily (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bruno et al., 2011</a>); or roflumilast, which targets all PDE4 proteins and is approved by the FDA for treating inflammatory lung disease. Shh was added simultaneously with each individual drug to the cells, and <i>Gli1</i> transcription levels were measured to assess Hh transduction. All three drugs inhibited Shh- or SAG-induced Hh target gene activation in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To exclude the possibility that PDE4D inhibitors are toxic to the cell, we assessed Wnt signaling by measuring transcripts of the Wnt target gene <i>Axin2</i>.

The interaction between the two pathways was revealed only recently by our previous study (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hillman et al., 2011</a>). We found that Nrps positively regulate Hh transduction, and Hh in turn induces <i>Nrp1</i> expression. In this previous study, we excluded the possibility that Nrps regulate binding or processing of the Hh ligand, and pinpointed Nrp participation in the Hh pathway at steps between Smo and SuFu. Beyond these findings, how the two pathways interact at the molecular level has been unknown. In the present study we discovered that the Sema3-Nrp pathway integrates with the Hh pathway by controlling the subcellular localization of PDE4D and consequently cAMP levels and PKA activity. Sema3 enhances the recruitment of PDE4D to the cell membrane by promoting its binding to the Nrp cytoplasmic domain (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As most cAMP is produced by AC at the cell membrane, we speculate that the recruitment of PDE4D brings the enzyme into close proximity to the site of cAMP production and may enable more efficient hydrolysis of synthesized cAMP before it diffuses throughout the entire cytoplasm, including the cilium base. Consequently PKA is inhibited, which in turn promotes Hh transduction."

Therefore, we believe that the Sema3-Nrp signaling is modulatory rather than permissive for the Hh pathway, but nevertheless is a powerful facilitator of Hh transduction. Sema3-Nrp signaling is likely to contribute to Hh transduction in many tissues in vivo. During the development of many tissues, <i>Sema3</i> genes and <i>Shh</i> are co-expressed, and the Hh pathway functions together with Nrps. For example, in the developing neural tube Sema3 and Shh act together to control the midline crossing of commissural axons (<a href=\"#bib42\">Parra and Zou, 2010</a>). In developing skin where Hh signaling is critical for hair follicle development, Nrps are co-expressed in hair follicle cells with Hh signaling components such as Smo (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hillman et al., 2011</a>). In developing cerebellum <i>Sema3</i> genes are co-expressed with <i>Shh</i> in Purkinje neurons. The two kinds of ligands may be released together to stimulate proliferation of GNPs in the cerebellar external granule layer (<a href=\"http://www.gensat.org/imagenavigator.jsp?imageID=50656\">http://www.gensat.org/imagenavigator.jsp?imageID=50656</a>). Indeed, we found that genetic knockout of both <i>Nrp</i> genes blocks Sema3 signaling and impairs GNP proliferation in vivo. Finally, RNA-seq results showed that in pediatric medulloblastoma, Sema3 and Nrp1 expression levels are significantly elevated (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cho et al., 2011</a>). This elevated expression may contribute to increased Hh signaling activity that promotes tumor growth."

The concentration of cAMP is controlled by two enzymes: the AC that produces cAMP, and the phosphosdiesterase (PDE) that hydrolyzes it. A recent study (<a href=\"#bib38a\">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013</a>) reported a mechanism through which GPR161 activates G\u03b1s-AC to produce cAMP at the cilia base, thereby switching off Hh signal transduction. Shh triggers the internalization of GPR161 from cilia, which switches on Hh signaling. This landmark work provides mechanistic insights into the coupling of cAMP-PKA activity to the on and off switch of the Hh pathway. Our study revealed the mechanism of cAMP control in Hh pathway\u2014PDE hydrolysis. Furthermore, we found that Sema3-Nrp signal-mediated cAMP degradation does not switch on Hh transduction, but rather potentiates already activated Hh transduction. We believe that the mechanism of cAMP control by the GPR161-G\u03b1s-AC and by Sema3-Nrp-PDE4D signaling coexist in the same cell, and may act at different stages of Hh signaling: GPR161 as a switch, and Sema3-Nrp as an amplifier."

In the absence of Hh ligand, PKA phosphorylates Gli3 and subsequently Gli3 is proteolytically processed into Gli3 repressor (<a href=\"#bib56a\">Wang et al., 2000</a>). Gli2 is the major Hh pathway transcriptional activator; its activation is controlled by translocation to the cilium (<a href=\"#bib29\">Humke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tukachinsky et al., 2010</a>). From our experiments we conclude that Sema3-Nrp signaling inhibits PKA and that inhibition of <i>Nrp</i> functions impairs Shh-induced Gli2 enrichment at cilia tips. These observations support the idea that overactive PKA following Nrp RNAi is the mechanism of reduced Gli2 enrichment at cilia tips. This result is consistent with two previous findings. First, activation of PKA by Forskolin inhibits cilium translocation of the SuFu\u2013Gli2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib29\">Humke et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tukachinsky et al., 2010</a>). Second, Gli2 localization to cilia tips is elevated in <i>PKA</i>-null mice (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tuson et al., 2011</a>). These studies also suggest that, within cilia, the SuFu\u2013Gli complex is dissociated by active Smo, and that only after the dissociation can free Gli2 be activated and translocated into the nucleus to turn on target gene transcription. Therefore, without activation by Hh ligand, Gli2 cannot be active even if it is transported to cilia. This may explain why Sema3-Nrp signaling cannot, on its own, turn on Hh target genes, but does amplify Hh-triggered transcription."

Alternatively, PKA may control Gli2 and Gli3 at distinct subcellular locations, and Sema3-Nrp only modulates PKA activity where it controls Gli2 activation. A similar divergence between Gli2 activation and Gli3R regulation has been reported in <i>Arl13B</i>-null mice (<a href=\"#bib11a\">Caspary et al., 2007</a>). In these mice, Gli3R is produced normally, whereas Gli2 is hyperactive. Another example is Eya1, a phosphatase that positively regulates Hh signaling. <i>Eya1</i> mutants exhibited reduced Hh transduction, but Gli3 processing was normal (<a href=\"#bib16a\">Eisner et al., 2015</a>). These findings suggest that Gli2 activation and Gli3 repressor formation are independently regulated during Hh signal transduction."

In cells without Nrps, Shh could still be able to lower PKA activity at the cilium base by inhibiting GPR161 to block Gli3 processing, whereas residual PKA activity could be sufficient to suppress Gli2 activation. In this model, the Sema3-Nrp-PDE4D pathway we describe here might act in parallel to Shh-Gpr161 pathway to more robustly reduce PKA activity in cilium, leading to more robust Gli2 activation."

                                "text": "We discovered another protein that interacts with the Nrp1 cytoplasmic domain: PDE4D. Sema3 enhances the Nrp-PDE4D interaction and promotes the recruitment of PDE4D to the plasma membrane. Subcellular localization of PDE4D is an important mechanism for the precise control of cAMP concentration in the cell (<a href=\"#bib27\">Houslay, 2010</a>). In airway epithelium PDE4D localizes to the apical domains of cells, where it degrades cAMP and prevents cAMP diffusion into other cellular locations (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barnes et al., 2005</a>). In cardiac myocytes PDE4D is rapidly recruited to the cell membrane by activated \u03b22-adrenergic receptor to precisely control the spatial and temporal cAMP concentration (<a href=\"#bib44\">Perry et al., 2002</a>). These previous findings are consistent with our proposed model in which PDE4D efficiently degrades cAMP at the site of cAMP production, thereby reducing cAMP concentration throughout the cytosol and at the cilium base. We showed that this reduced cAMP concentration inhibited PKA activity, thus promoting Hh transduction. Our discovery was confirmed by a recent study in zebrafish showing that a small molecule that inhibits PDE4 promotes Hh signal transduction (<a href=\"#bib58\">Williams et al., 2015</a>). In additional to PKA, cAMP activates EPAC proteins, guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Ras-like GTPases (<a href=\"#bib8\">Borland et al., 2009</a>), and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels in the cilia of the olfactory neurons (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bradley et al., 2005</a>). It will be intriguing to see whether these cAMP targets also contribute to Hh transduction or other Hh-triggered effects on cells."

Remarkably, we found that targeting PDE4D to inhibit the newly discovered Sema3-Nrp-PDE4D-PKA pathway powerfully blocks the growth of Hh-related MBs that are resistant to Smo inhibitors. One of the PDE4D inhibitors, roflumilast, is used in clinics to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Giembycz and Maurice, 2014</a>). In addition to roflumilast, many PDE4D inhibitors are under development to improve cognitive and psychological performances, some of which are in clinical trials (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gavalda and Roberts, 2013</a>).

Although Smo inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of Hh-related cancers, acquired drug resistance due to Smo mutations makes it necessary to develop drugs that block a downstream signaling event. A previous study by Matt Scott and his colleagues identified Neuropilin1 (Nrp1) as a positive regulator of Shh pathway but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this study, the authors identified the PDE4D phosphodiesterase as a downstream effector of Nrp1 in the regulation of Shh signaling. They provided evidence that Sema3F, a ligand for Nrps, stimulates the binding of PDE4D to Nrp1 and thus plasma membrane recruitment of PDE4D, leading to the degradation of cAMP at its membrane production site and consequently reduced PKA activity, which antagonizes Hh signaling, both at the centrosome and in the cytosol. Consistent with this model, pharmacological inhibitors of PDE4 inhibit Shh signaling, GNP proliferation, and medulloblastoma growth. The reviewers find the work potentially significant as it reveals a new regulatory mechanism of Hh signal transduction and implicates PDE4D as a promising target to treat Hh-related tumors. However, the reviewers also expressed substantial concerns that should be addressed by additional experiments and/or by discussion before publication is recommended."

For example, it is not clear whether Sema3F is expressed or upregulated in medulloblastoma. The authors used the Nrp<sup>panA</sup> antibody, which blocked Sema3-Nrp interaction, to demonstrate the involvement of Sema3F. However, this antibody may block the interaction of Npr1 with other ligands. The authors should employ RNAi knockdown or genetic knockout (if existing) to address whether Sema3F is the ligand for Npr1 in the regulation of Shh signaling and medulloblastoma growth."

T197 phosphorylation is recognized as an autophosphorylation required for full activity. That could be extrapolated to imagine that pT197 might be a measure of PKA activity. However, it is generally thought (including in the very reference cited indirectly \u2013 Barzi cites Iyer et al., 2005) that T197 phosphorylation is constitutive and not regulated. Thus, for example, in many cells most catalytic subunit is complexed to regulatory subunit and inactive but is phosphorylated at T197. Even results in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> illustrate this: pPKA levels are increased only by 30% in response to forskolin. Thus, pT197 is not a universally recognized marker of PKA activity and I am not aware of convincing evidence that this view should change. The second measure of PKA activity is the use of a PKA consensus phosphopeptide antibody on Western blots. This has been used before (for example in Barzi et al.) and it likely has enough specificity for PKA substrates based on similar bands for Nrp treatments and forskolin but the 5 or so bands affected are not known (or described) and it is clearly hard to convert those results into any quantitative measure, let alone ruling out other possible contributions to the observed changes. So, I believe this measurement is a useful guide but neither definitive nor quantitative. As mentioned earlier, and in part because of the systematic difficulty of measuring PKA activity in vivo, an important supplement is to measure the net effect of PKA activity targeted towards the most relevant substrates (possibly reflecting local PKA activities) by measuring Gli processing."

The panA antibodies might seem to serve the same purpose but antibody binding could have additional consequences: blocking binding of a co-receptor or triggering a change in Nrp directly.

While there is room for plenty of complexity regarding cAMP and PKA actions, it is nevertheless surprising that a large effect on the pathway supposedly mediated by changes in cAMP and PKA has no effect at all on Gli3 processing. This test was performed because direct measures of cAMP and PKA did not convince all reviewers. Those tests remain basically the same, including the unqualified assertion that pT197 is an accepted measure of PKA activation. I think the authors could use their own data with forskolin etc. to try to convince readers that pT197 indicates activity but I think it is not acceptable to state this is an accepted, justified measure.

Concerning the data only, we see a measure of Gli2 intensity at cilia tips but not elsewhere. Is the reduction because Gli2 is at the cilium base or because there is less Gli2 total? The authors state that they have measured a transport defect. Concerning models and explanations, the discussed precedents are complex and cannot be distilled to Gli2 at the tip being a measure of PKA activity. Complete loss of PKA activity was shown to promote Gli2 accumulation at tips. Stimulation by forskolin was reported as doing the opposite but Tuson report that the effect is still seen in PKA-null animals and therefore independent of PKA. At present, I find explanations for the Gli2 and Gli3 observations rather implausible (especially a PKA-independent Gli3 processing mechanism suddenly kicking in at 100% efficiency when cAMP is altered by Nrp). If different pools of cAMP and PKA are responsible it is not obvious where they would reside. The cilium or its base appears to be a key site for regulated AC activity and PKA activity regarding Gli processing and likely for Gli localization. Does pT197 antibody show no change in cilia or is there other evidence for different spatial effects of Nrp? Altogether, I find the Nrp-PDE-cAMP-PKA-Gli connections far from resolved and I believe it is important not to represent these as proven and straightforward."

One minor point is that, when discussing the differential effect of Nrp1/2 RNAi on Gli3 processing and Gli2 inhibition, the authors may want to consider a third possibility, i.e., Gli3 processing and Gli2 inhibition could be sensitive to different levels of PKA activity. For example, in Npr1/2 RNAi cells, Shh could still inhibit ciliary PKA activity via down-regulating Gpr161 to block Gli3 processing; however, the residual PKA activity might still be able to partially suppress Gli2 activity. In this view, the Sema3/Nrp1/2/PDE4 pathway acts in parallel with the Shh/SmoGpr161 pathway to achieve a more dramatic downregulation of ciliary PKA activity, leading to more robust Gli2 activation."

Similarly we do not expect simultaneous RNA interference with several Sema3 RNA pools is likely to give a compelling result. We agree with the reviewers that the Nrp<sup>panA</sup> antibody may be blocking more than one Sema3 ligand. The antibody binds to the A1-A2 domain in Nrp1 and Nrp2, thereby blocking all Sema3 interaction with Nrps. This antibody has been extensively tested and validated (<a href=\"#bib2\">Appleton et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Liang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pan et al., 2007</a>).

Therefore, although we appreciate the reviewers\u2019 suggestion of genetic knockout or RNAi knockdown of Sema3F, we think the suggested experiment will not convincingly impede Shh transduction due to the presence of multiple Sema3 ligands and the redundancy of Sema3/Nrp interactions, as detailed above and in the revised manuscript.

However, the two studies focused on different aspects of MB. Two important points: 1) Snuderl et al. used D283-MED and D341-MED human MB cells, which are classified as group 3 and group 4 MB, respectively. Groups 3 and 4 MBs are <i>not</i> MBs derived from damage to Hh transduction. We, on the other hand, focused on the Shh group of MB. 2) It is known that different classes of Nrp ligands activate distinct downstream signalling cascades (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pellet-Many et al., 2008</a>). The ligand Sema3 activates the small GTPase of the Rho family, and regulates the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton in neurons. This signaling cascade is implicated in growth cone collapse (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Polleux et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Zanata et al., 2002</a>). Sema3 also inhibits PKA activity in growing axons via unknown mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib42\">Parra and Zou, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shelly et al., 2011</a>). On the other hand, VEGF family proteins signal through phospholipase C (PLC) to activate the prosurvival/ pro-growth factor ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt, and contribute to endothelial stimulation and pathologic angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bielenberg et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Soker et al., 1998</a>). PLGF is a membrane of the VEGF protein family. Therefore Snuderl et al. and our current study report distinct signaling mechanisms downstream of Nrps, triggered by different ligands. We have revised the discussion section accordingly to emphasize the fact that different classes of Nrp ligands act through distinct pathways, and that the pathways discovered by Snuderl et al. and by us both contribute to pathogenesis of MB. We have added this information to the Discussion."

For our study the most valuable information is the cAMP concentration change in response to perturbations in gene expression. Knowing the absolute cAMP concentration in the cell, even if feasible, would not add much to our understanding of how Sema3-Nrp regulates the Hh pathway. In general it would be revealing to know absolute concentrations of the proteins and small molecules in Hh and other pathways, in specific subcellular locations, and we look forward to the day when this is more routine.

The second measure of PKA activity is the use of a PKA consensus phosphopeptide antibody on Western blots. This has been used before (for example in Barzi et al.) and it likely has enough specificity for PKA substrates based on similar bands for Nrp treatments and Forskolin but the 5 or so bands affected are not known (or described) and it is clearly hard to convert those results into any quantitative measure, let alone ruling out other possible contributions to the observed changes. So, I believe this measurement is a useful guide but neither definitive nor quantitative.

Second, they found that adding Forskolin to PKAnull cells reduced Gli2 enrichment at the cilia tips (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tuson et al. 2011</a>, supplementary Figure 7). As Tuson et al. suggested in their discussion, the Forskolin effect may be mediated by cAMP effectors other than PKA, such as Epac and cAMP-gated ion channels. In such an artificial condition, in which cAMP levels rise to many fold higher than physiological levels, these cAMP effectors may change cilia physiology in ways that are difficult to know, thereby indirectly changing Gli2 localization. Our data show that the Sema3-induced cAMP change is much less than the effect of Forskolin (50% in magnitude) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2</a>), and the effect of Sema3-Nrp on Gli2 enrichment at cilia tips is presumably mainly mediated by PKA. Nevertheless, Epac and cAMP-gated ion channels may indeed have some affect upon Gli2 enrichment at cilia tips under physiological conditions.
