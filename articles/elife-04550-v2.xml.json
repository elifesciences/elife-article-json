                    "text": "How generalist parasites with wide host ranges can evolve is a central question in parasite evolution. <i>Albugo candida</i> is an obligate biotrophic parasite that consists of many physiological races that each specialize on distinct Brassicaceae host species. By analyzing genome sequence assemblies of five isolates, we show they represent three races that are genetically diverged by \u223c1%. Despite this divergence, their genomes are mosaic-like, with \u223c25% being introgressed from other races. Sequential infection experiments show that infection by adapted races enables subsequent infection of hosts by normally non-infecting races. This facilitates introgression and the exchange of effector repertoires, and may enable the evolution of novel races that can undergo clonal population expansion on new hosts. We discuss recent studies on hybridization in other eukaryotes such as yeast, <i>Heliconius</i> butterflies, Darwin's finches, sunflowers and cichlid fishes, and the implications of introgression for pathogen evolution in an agro-ecological environment."

By analyzing genome sequence assemblies of five isolates, we show they represent three races that are genetically diverged by \u223c1%. Despite this divergence, their genomes are mosaic-like, with \u223c25% being introgressed from other races. Sequential infection experiments show that infection by adapted races enables subsequent infection of hosts by normally non-infecting races. This facilitates introgression and the exchange of effector repertoires, and may enable the evolution of novel races that can undergo clonal population expansion on new hosts. We discuss recent studies on hybridization in other eukaryotes such as yeast, <i>Heliconius</i> butterflies, Darwin's finches, sunflowers and cichlid fishes, and the implications of introgression for pathogen evolution in an agro-ecological environment."

Compared to necrotrophs that reproduce on dead plant material, obligate biotrophic parasites can only reproduce on living tissue, and thus are intimately associated with their hosts (<a href=\"#bib56\">Thines, 2014</a>). This might be expected to result in host specialization. The adaptive evolution of, for example, new effectors that enable more efficient exploitation of one host species, increases the risk of detection in other host species by triggering their immune system (<a href=\"#bib32\">Martin and Kamoun, 2012</a>). Due to this trade-off, the saying \u2018<i>Jack of all trades, master of none</i>\u2019 is especially true for obligate biotrophic parasites, because natural selection that maximises parasite fitness on one particular host species might lead to specialisation and reduced host range (e.g., <a href=\"#bib12\">Dong et al., 2014</a>). Yet there are generalist biotrophic parasites that appear to have overcome this evolutionary dilemma and show virulence on diverse hosts."

During asexual reproduction, diploid zoospores are formed in a special propagule (the zoosporangium) on a thallus of hyphae beneath the leaf epidermis. White blisters comprising large numbers of dehydrated sporangia eventually rupture the epidermis to release inoculum for dispersal. When reproducing sexually, fertilization between two isolates results in non-motile diploid thick-walled oospores that can resist extreme temperatures and desiccation.

It has been suggested that enhanced susceptibility imposed by <i>Albugo</i> might accelerate adaptation of other pathogen species to an <i>Albugo</i>-susceptible host (<a href=\"#bib56\">Thines, 2014</a>). However, no evolutionary rationale has been put forward to explain why it might be adaptive for <i>Albugo</i> sp. to render its hosts so susceptible to other pathogens that could compete for access to the same resources (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cooper et al., 2008</a>). Arguably, suppression of host innate immunity could facilitate cohabitation of distinct physiological races and thus may enable genetic exchange between them. Introgression, here defined as the introduction by recombination of syntenic nucleotide variation from a parental donor race into the genome of a recipient race (<a href=\"#bib70\">Hedrick, 2013</a>), could slow down genetic divergence, and hence, retard speciation. On the other hand, introgression between races that are well-adapted to exploit different host plants could be maladaptive and strongly selected against because hybrids will inherit effector alleles derived from both parental races. Given that immune recognition of even a single effector is sufficient to trigger the immune response and stop an infection, hybrids that possess an expanded repertoire of effector alleles are likely to have a strong fitness disadvantage on most potential host plants."

(2) Does suppression of host innate immunity enable cohabitation and growth of races with non-overlapping host ranges? To answer these questions, we generated genome sequence assemblies of five isolates that were collected from four host species (<i>Brassica oleracea</i>, <i>Brassica juncea</i>, <i>Capsella bursa-pastoris</i>, and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We sequenced one isolate of one race, and two isolates of each of two additional races. We show that these races are not genetically isolated despite having non-overlapping host ranges. Recombination analysis shows there is widespread genetic exchange between <i>A. candida</i> races, and that hybridisation leading to introgression has occurred numerous times, which include exchanges in the recent past. To explain this observation, we examined whether pre-infection of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>Brassica</i> with virulent <i>A. candida</i> races results in enhanced host susceptibility, and found that pre-infection with a virulent strain enables proliferation of an <i>A. candida</i> isolate that would otherwise not colonize that host. For the two races with two isolates, we show that population expansion is by clonal reproduction. We discuss the impact of genetic exchange on <i>A. candida</i> evolution, and consider the implications for pathogen evolution and reproduction in an agro-ecological environment."

To test this we performed sequential inoculation experiments, identifying races using the genome sequences to create race-specific DNA markers. Race-specific PCR of pre-inoculated plants (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary files 5, 6</a>) shows preinfection by AcNc2 suppresses resistance in <i>A. thaliana</i> accession Ws-2 leaves towards the <i>B. juncea-</i>infecting race, Ac2V (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Also, preinfection by AcBoT suppresses <i>B. oleracea</i> resistance towards Ac2V (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Furthermore, defense suppression was so effective that Ac2V was able to complete its life cycle on both <i>A. thaliana</i> Ws-2 and <i>B. oleracea</i> as observed by successful subsequent infection on <i>B. juncea</i> from the sequentially inoculated plants. In a reciprocal experiment, preinfection of <i>B. juncea</i> with Ac2V enabled AcNc2 growth on <i>B. juncea</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Therefore, AcNc2 not only can suppress Ac2V recognition on <i>A. thaliana</i>, but Ac2V is also capable of suppressing <i>B. juncea</i> resistance towards AcNc2.

However, by estimating the coalescence time of the introgressed regions we showed that hybridisation between the races is an ongoing evolutionary process, with some introgression events occurring as recent as 220 years ago.

Crucially, we showed that infection with a virulent race of <i>A. candida</i> suppresses host immunity sufficiently to enable subsequent co-colonization by an otherwise non-virulent race (see also <a href=\"#bib11\">Cooper et al., 2008</a>). Although this opens up competition between races for the same (limited) resource, it also brings a significant evolutionary/ecological advantage by blurring the borders of host range, thereby creating secondary contact zones that enable sexual reproduction and genetic exchange between races. Given the high-host specificity of obligate biotrophic parasites, this ability of <i>A. candida</i> to enable occasional genetic exchange between specialised races could create novel repertoires of effector alleles that would enable colonization of new hosts (\u2018host jumps\u2019). For example, <i>Arabidopsis</i> resistance to race Ac2V can at least in part be explained by the <i>WRR4</i> gene, a classical NB-LRR <i>R</i> gene, which presumably recognizes an Ac2V effector (<a href=\"#bib7\">Borhan et al., 2008</a>). Hypothetically, if this Ac2V effector would segregate away in hybrid offspring, or by loss of heterozygosity, these offspring could become virulent on <i>WRR4</i>-carrying <i>Arabidopsis</i> hosts."

                        "text": "Once a new hybrid race has been established, it can reproduce asexually and clonally on susceptible hosts without continued genetic exchange with other races. We base this inference on the exceptionally high genotypic similarity between independent isolates that infect the same host plant (i.e., AcBoT-AcBoL and AcEm2-AcNc2). For example, AcBoT and AcBoL share &gt;97% of their heterozygous sites. This observation is significant because it rules out sexual reproduction (or selfing with recombination), given that Mendelian segregation would eradicate this high level of genotypic similarity within a single generation. Hence, we conclude that reproduction of AcBoT and AcBoL is asexual and clonal, and we speculate that these races may have derived from a common ancestor that was selected coincident with the onset of widespread <i>B. oleracea</i> cultivation in Europe. The <i>A. thaliana</i>-infecting isolates (AcNc2 and AcEm2) were sampled at a broad spatiotemporal scale (14 years and 100 miles apart), and yet they showed a very high nucleotide similarity (&gt;99.95% identical). This shows that clonal reproduction coincided with their rapid population expansion. Remarkably though, compared to the former two isolates, AcEm2 and AcNc2 had a relatively low level of observed heterozygosity, and the number of heterozygous sites was &gt;13 times less than that of AcBoT and AcBoL. Since these races do not self-fertilize, this suggests that gene conversion or another mechanism might be operating to reduce the nucleotide diversity within their genomes over time. Such loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has also been reported for <i>Phytophthora capsici</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lamour et al., 2012</a>), and in yeast, LOH events can encompass entire chromosomes, which is thought to be explained by the break-induced replication (BIR) mechanism (<a href=\"#bib11a\">Diogo et al., 2009</a>)."

For example, <i>Helianthus anomalus</i> is a wild sunflower species derived via hybridization between two parental species, and its genome is characterised by parental species blocks. In this case, however, hybridisation and speciation occurred over a short evolutionary time-span (10\u201360 generations) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ungerer et al., 1998</a>), which differs from hybridisation in <i>A. candida</i>, where it appears to be a persistent evolutionary process. Darwin's finches are a classic example of a young adaptive radiation, and recent research by <a href=\"#bib25\">Lamichhaney et al. (2015)</a> showed that species from different islands show extensive genomic exchange through recent hybridisation. Introgressive hybridization was found to occur throughout the radiation, fuelling the genetic variation in beak shape, and thereby facilitating adaptive evolution. Perhaps more pertinently, the relationships of members of the parasite's principal host, plants of the <i>Brassica</i> genus, are themselves considered to be the result of a number of hybridisation events, as defined by the Triangle of U (<a href=\"#bib86\">Nagahara, 1935</a>). Hybridisation events have also been implicated in speciation and adaptive radiation in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib87\">Nichols et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, rare introgression events among <i>Heliconius</i> butterflies are believed to have facilitated the exchange of mimicry genes across multiple time points post speciation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Martin et al., 2013</a>). Evidence for more frequent introgression has been observed in the malaria vector species complex (<i>Anopheles gambiae</i>) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Fontaine et al., 2015</a>). More examples of such introgression can be anticipated to emerge given the continued improvement and reduction in cost of DNA sequencing methods, and the development of novel software that enable analysis of whole genome recombination (Ward and van Oosterhout, submitted)."

Genetic exchanges amongst three strains of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> have been quantified using genomic data which show that the rate of outcrossing is remarkably low, with only 314 outcrossing events during circa 16 million cell divisions (<a href=\"#bib95\">Ruderfer et al., 2006</a>). With such a low rate of genetic exchange, the strains accumulate sequence variation by mutation and thus genetically diverge. Given the low level of genetic exchange amongst the <i>A. candida</i> host races, this may also explain their genetic divergence. In yeast, natural hybrids have been reported in many species (<a href=\"#bib14b\">Dujon, 2010</a>), with hybridisation leading to the nonreciprocal genetic exchange accompanied by the loss of genes and genomic regions. This results in chimeric sequences from which novel lineages could emerge (<a href=\"#bib68\">Greig et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Usher and Bond, 2009</a>). For example, <i>Lachancea kluyveri</i> possesses mega-base long chromosomal fragments of distinct composition (<a href=\"#bib88\">Payen et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, the genomes of wine strains of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> contain introgressed regions from <i>Saccharomyces paradoxus</i>, <i>S. kudriavzevii kudriavzevii</i>, <i>S. uvarum uvarum</i>, and <i>Zygosaccharomyces bailii</i> (<a href=\"#bib14b\">Dujon, 2010</a>). Given that the introgressed sequences in the genome of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> are nearly identical to those in the donor genomes, hybridisation must have occurred recently, which is similar to what we observe in <i>A. candida</i>. Although introgression appears to be a general phenomenon in yeast genomes, its importance for evolution has yet to be determined (<a href=\"#bib14b\">Dujon, 2010</a>). The mosaic-like genome structure of <i>A. candida</i> suggests that hybridisation and genetic introgression may play an equally important role in the biology of this oomycete."

In rare novel recombinant races, such maladapted effectors that trigger the response of a specific host may be segregated away, allowing the recombinant to avoid immune recognition and colonise this new host. Once this happens, the new hybrid can rapidly expand its geographic range and population size through clonal reproduction. Hybrids between <i>Phytophthora</i> spp. races can show expanded host range compared to their parental lineages (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ersek et al., 1995</a>) while the importance of virulence gene transfer that subsequently leads to the expansion of pathogens' host range has also been reported for bacterial and fungal pathogens (<a href=\"#bib13\">Doolittle, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mehrabi et al., 2011</a>)."

Tests were conducted using a critical value \u03b1 = 0.05 and p-values were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons of sequences. Sequences were linear using unphase base calling and the random assignment of one of the nucleotides at each polymorphic site. Given that recombination algorithms use <i>cis</i> mutations to define regions of a sequence that share the same phylogenetic history, the statistical power to detect recombination is reduced when using unphased data (Darren Martin pers. comm.). This is because the signal of unphase base calling erodes any underlying signal of recombination. This procedure is conservative and underestimates the true number of recombination events because it reduces sequence similarity between the recombinant and parental sequence. Phylogenetic evidence of recombination was required to confirm a recombination event. Window sizes for each detection method were set to defaults. Only events for which the software identified the parental sequences (i.e., no \u2018unknowns\u2019) without ambiguous start and end position of the recombination block are reported and used in the analyses. Furthermore, events were only considered to be genuine if they were supported by at least three of the five detection algorithms. Hence, the estimates of the number of recombination events are conservative."

HybRIDS uses a colour triangle to visualise the sequence similarity between aligned sequences. It calculates the colour of each 100 bp window based on the proportion of SNPs shared between the pairwise sequences. All monomorphic sites were excluded in this calculation. HybRIDS uses the additive colour system in which the primary colours used are red, green, and blue. These colours are plotted on the corners of the RGB colour triangle, which is shown in the legend as a reference. In cases where all SNPs are shared between just two of the three races, the hybrid colour is an exact 50% mix of two primary colours. The hybrid colours are yellow, purple and turquoise, and these colours suggest recent gene exchange between the two races. At such recombined regions, the third race receives its primary colour (because by definition, it must be unique at the 100 bp window and completely dissimilar from the other two races). Older recombined regions are predicted to have accumulated SNPs unique to each race, causing the block of two hybridizing races to diverge. In the graph, the colour of such areas contains more than 50% of the primary colour of that race. The colours in the centre of the triangle are pale and reflect areas where the three races share approximately similar numbers of polymorphisms. The SNPs in these pale regions, and in regions where the colours are close to the primary colours, are more likely caused by mutations than by genetic exchange. Note that primary colours can also be assigned to regions that may have recombined, but which originate from a race that was not sampled, and hence, which polymorphisms were not included in this analysis."

We used two dating methods, a binomial mass function and an analysis with the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) software package version 1.7 (<a href=\"#bib14a\">Drummond and Rambaut, 2007</a>). A binomial mass function was used to estimate the mean divergence time of a block of given size with an observed number of SNPs. In order to correct for mutation saturation, homoplasy, back mutations and transition/transversion ratios, we converted the observed number of SNPs into the number of mutations using a JC correction (<a href=\"#bib73\">Jukes and Cantor, 1969</a>). The probability of finding a number of SNPs less or equal to the observed number in a block of known size was calculated. The mean time is found when the binomial mass function returns a probability value p = 0.5. This approach finds the most probable age of the recombination event, and it assumes that since the recombination event, the block evolved neutrally over t years, and that each base has the chance to mutate with a probability \u00b5 per year (\u00b5 = 10<sup>\u22126</sup> and 10<sup>\u22127</sup>). The algorithm uses a strict molecular clock, and because the mutation rate in oomycetes is unknown, we assumed \u00b5 = 10<sup>\u22126</sup> as well as \u00b5 = 10<sup>\u22127</sup> per base per year. The lower value of the mutation rate of \u00b5 = 10<sup>\u22127</sup> was used as a more conservative estimate. Given that we do not know the mutation rate of oomycetes, the estimated dates are merely an approximation and shown to illustrate that the exchanged blocks are dated back to a wide range of evolutionary times. The simple dating method based on the binomial mass function was compared to more computationally intensive analysis with BEAST by dating 20 recombination events from the \u2018contig 1\u2019 of AcNc2 and performing a linear regression analysis to confirm application of the faster binomial algorithm to all 675 recombination events. The principle aim of these analyses was to identify whether or not recombinant regions span a range of dates (in line with the expectation under an introgression model)."

The genome of <i>A. candida</i> was published in 2011 by Links et al. Here the authors resequence 5 strains and analyze 3 strains in fine detail. The races are found to have a mosaic like genome structure and that races diverged a considerable amount of time ago. <i>A. candida</i> is host specific, and thus races associated with a given host are not expected to cross breed with those on another host; the authors established presence of recombination blocks. They also demonstrate that co-inoculated strains from a host and non-host on a host can establish infection by the non-host strain and replicate this effect for several strain-host combination (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). However, this work is not repeated and lacks the validation from a full second experiment. Furthermore, it only shows the strains can coexist in the same environment, but it does not demonstrate hybridization or recombination. I think if they could demonstrate sexual reproduction or hybridization among diverged races, and tie the hybrid genomes into this story they would have a great paper. As it stands, I think this would be better published in a disciplinary journal given that it mostly provides information on more distant divergence, adaptation and coinfection. Lack of sex also needs to be more formally tested on a larger sample of strains."

If host-ranges are determined by multiple loci, one would except that recombination will quickly lead to super genotypes, with very wide host ranges. Apparently this did not happen; maybe recombination cannot change this. This would be the case if they are sitting in non-recombining gene clusters, or a single locus (with multiple alleles) is responsible for host ranges.

This comment is asking us to solve the molecular basis of non-host resistance in non-colonized plants to these different races. Researchers spend their careers trying to understand non-host resistance, and it is unrealistic to expect a meaningful and decisive explanation to emerge from comparison of 5 isolates of 3 races that infect three different host plants. We have of course generated a list of candidate genes that might underpin non-host resistance in Arabidopsis to the Brassica races, but we want to test them to see which of these candidate genes are causal, and also characterize the corresponding resistance genes that underpin non-host resistance. We could certainly say \u201cit might be one of these 10 polymorphic secreted genes that underpins host specificity\u201d, but it would be better to combine that with empirical tests in a different paper."

However, we would be happy to include a table with exact probabilities of all 675 events. Also, we can easily include a (standard) LD analysis that will confirm that the observed mosaic genome structure is consistent with recombination.

Because we failed to observe heterozygotes, reviewers saw this as a negative result. However, our analysis suggests that the rate of (genetic exchange + recombination) is 100-1000 times lower than the mutation rate (shown in further population genetic simulations not presented in the paper, but easily provided for supplementary information), so one would expect genetic exchange to be rare."

The significance of our work is that it shows that races that colonize different Brassicaceae, and which were previously regarded as being incapable of genetic exchange with each other, can in fact coexist due to immunosuppression, and thus (if of opposite mating type) can mate. This observation, combined with the unambiguous evidence for mosaic genomes, provides a truly novel insight into how parasites can coevolve with their hosts, enabling substantial diversification while retaining potential for further release of novelty by occasional inter-race mating and recombination. Despite their considerable genetic diversification (\u223c1%, which is equivalent to the divergence between humans and chimps), <i>A. candida</i> races exchange so much genetic material that \u223c25% of their genome is from another race. We show this beyond any doubt (using five independent algorithms as well as a probabilistic recombinant analysis in HybRIDS software) and use computer simulations to exclude other evolutionary scenarios. This level of genetic exchange + recombination between specialised pathogen races has <i>never</i> been observed in the wild at this scale. But most novel of all, we believe, are the evolutionary and ecological implications; we show that very rarely, the new recombinants are extremely fit and colonise a given host plant over a large geographic range through clonal population expansion. We demonstrate this using population genetic simulations that show that clonal population expansion is the only plausible origin of the AcBoT and AcBoL (<i>B. oleracea</i> infecting) race as well as the AcNc2/AcEm2 race. We show that for AcBoT and AcBoL, this must have happened recently (probably in the last few hundred years, probably when <i>Brassica oleracea</i> began to be widely grown in Europe), which has profound implications for agriculture."

We have gone to some length to broaden the appeal of our findings by considering them within a broader context of other pathogens, yeast, plants, malaria vectors and vertebrates, including the recent paper in Nature on introgression in Darwin\u2019s finches. For example, in the Discussion we highlight literature on yeast genome evolution, in which the authors infer recent hybridizations based on a genome analysis of introgression in <i>S. cerevisiae.</i> Introgressed regions from various other yeast species can be nearly identical to those in the donor genomes, so hybridisation must have occurred relatively recently. We draw a similar conclusion for <i>Albugo</i>, and in addition, we estimate the dates when recombination or hybridisation has occurred in our study system."

If host-ranges are determined by multiple loci, one would except that recombination will quickly lead to super genotypes, with very wide host ranges. Apparently this did not happen; maybe recombination cannot change this. This would be the case if they are sitting in non-recombining gene clusters, or a single locus (with multiple alleles) is responsible for host ranges.
