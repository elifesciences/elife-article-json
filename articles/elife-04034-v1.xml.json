This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u2018Tumour micro-environment elicits innate resistance to RAF inhibitors through HGF secretion\u2019 by Straussman and colleagues, published in Nature in 2012 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Straussman et al., 2012</a>). The key experiments being replicated in this study are from Figure 2A, C, and D (and Supplemental Figure 11) and Figure 4C (and Supplemental Figure 19) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Straussman et al., 2012</a>). Figure 2 demonstrates resistance to drug sensitivity conferred by co-culture with some stromal cell lines and identifies the secreted factor responsible as HGF. In Figure 4, Straussman and colleagues show that blocking the HGF receptor MET abrogates HGF\u2019s rescue of drug sensitivity. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a>, and the results of the replications will be published by <i>eLife</i>."

This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from \u2018Tumour micro-environment elicits innate resistance to RAF inhibitors through HGF secretion\u2019 by Straussman and colleagues, published in Nature in 2012 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Straussman et al., 2012</a>). The key experiments being replicated in this study are from Figure 2A, C, and D (and Supplemental Figure 11) and Figure 4C (and Supplemental Figure 19) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Straussman et al., 2012</a>). Figure 2 demonstrates resistance to drug sensitivity conferred by co-culture with some stromal cell lines and identifies the secreted factor responsible as HGF. In Figure 4, Straussman and colleagues show that blocking the HGF receptor MET abrogates HGF\u2019s rescue of drug sensitivity. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <a href=\"http://centerforopenscience.org/\">Center for Open Science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scienceexchange.com/\">Science Exchange</a>, and the results of the replications will be published by <i>eLife</i>."

Specifically, BRAF-mutant melanomas, which show an initial response to RAF inhibitors, usually become resistant to the therapy (<a href=\"#bib7\">Nickoloff and Vande Woude, 2012</a>). The identification of stroma-mediated resistance in BRAF-mutant melanomas, through the secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), therefore indicates a potential therapeutic strategy through combination treatment of RAF inhibitors and inhibition of the HGF activated pathway (<a href=\"#bib10\">Straussman et al., 2012</a>). This report is the first to identify paracrine HGF as a potential mechanism for the development of drug resistance (<a href=\"#bib4a\">Ghiso and Giordano, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4b\">Glaire et al., 2012</a>)."

Using a cell proliferation assay, they reported that fibroblast-conditioned medium rescued BRAF-mutant melanoma cells from PLX4720 sensitivity, which indicated that a secreted factor was involved. This was a key finding demonstrating that the stromal environment of the tumor cells could mediate their response to drug treatment. This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 3."

This finding showed a similar effect to treatment with conditioned media from stromal cells that secrete HGF (see Figure 2A) and supported the hypothesis that HGF is the growth factor responsible for rescuing melanoma cells from drug sensitivity. This experiment will be replicated in Protocol 4."

Treatment with crizotinib reduced the increase in proliferation due to co-culture with an HGF-secreting stromal cell line. This experiment provided further support for the hypothesis that HGF was responsible for rescue from drug sensitivity and also provided evidence that that rescue was MET dependent. This experiment is replicated in Protocol 5."

While Lezcano and colleagues' replication also detected the presence of HGF in human melanoma tumor cells and stromal cells with increased expression at disease progression, they did not identify a statistically significant correlation between HGF expression and clinical outcome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Lezcano et al., 2014</a>). While both of the studies come to different conclusions about the association of stromal HGF and clinical outcome, the 95% confidence intervals of the standardized measure of the effect (Cohen's <i>d)</i> for each study substantially overlap. A study published around the same time as the work of Straussman and colleagues supports the negative association between HGF and clinical response to RAF inhibitor treatments through an analysis of HGF levels in patient plasma samples (<a href=\"#bib11\">Wilson et al., 2012</a>)."

Nakagawa and colleagues observed that tumor-secreted (not stromal secreted) HGF could induce resistance to the VEGFR inhibitor lenvatinib, and that this resistance could be overcome by co-treatment with golvatinib, a MET inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib6\">Nakagawa et al., 2014</a>). Etnyre and colleagues reported that c-MET and BRAF inhibitors had synergistic inhibitory effects when exposed in combination to melanoma cell lines (<a href=\"#bib3a\">Etnyre et al., 2013</a>). Casbas-Hernandez and colleagues co-cultured MCF10 cells with immortalized mammoplasty derived fibroblasts and observed a correlation between the levels of fibroblast-secreted HGF and the differentiation of the MCF10 cells towards a ductal carcinoma phenotype. They also observed a correlation between HGF expression and the more invasive basal-like tumors as opposed to the less invasive luminal tumors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Casbas-Hernandez et al., 2013</a>). HGF is also being evaluated as a potential biomarker to indicate potential treatment choices (<a href=\"#bib9\">Penuel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Xie et al., 2013</a>)."

Based on our power calculations, to be able to detect the effect size reported in <a href=\"#bib10\">Straussman et al., 2012</a> (<i>d</i> = 0.66609 for RAFi or RAFi + MEKi-treated patients), a total sample size of 74 would have been needed assuming an allocation ratio of 1. However, as seen in Supplemental Table S7, the allocation ratio was approximately 2 with an overrepresentation of HGF-positive samples. If we were to assume the new samples had the same ratio of HGF-negative to HGF-positive samples this would have required an increase in the needed total sample size to 84 to account for the unequal allocation. Interestingly, Lezcano and colleagues also saw an unequal allocation (4.75), but with an overrepresentation of HGF-negative samples. With this unequal distribution of samples the total sample size would have needed to be 126 to have at least 80% power. This could be implied that both studies were underpowered to detect the effect size reported in <a href=\"#bib10\">Straussman et al., 2012</a>, which tested 34 samples, even though both studies were highly powered to detect larger effect sizes. However, this sort of after-the-fact power analysis is better suited for designing a study to detect a potential effect size, not accessing the outcome of a study. To better visualize the range of plausible effects from each of these studies the 95% confidence interval of the effect size is better suited. Also, using a meta-analytical approach to combine the effect sizes provides an indication of the present knowledge of the effect. This is an approach that will be utilized with the replication data generated from this project. We computed the effect size and 95% confidence intervals for these studies as well as from a meta-analytic combining the two datasets. A forest plot is included for the reviewers to see the results visually (and will be made available on the OSF project page (<a href=\"https://osf.io/p4lzc\">https://osf.io/p4lzc</a>) in addition to the summary data below.

The cross-study variation, such as approaches that utilize the 95% confidence interval of the effect size, can be useful in conducting power calculations when planning adequate sample sizes for detecting the true population effect size, which requires a range of possible observed effect sizes. However, the Reproducibility Project: <i>Cancer</i> Biology is designed to conduct replications that have 80% power to detect the point estimate of the originally reported effect size. While this has the limitation of being underpowered to detect smaller effects than what is originally reported, this standardizes the approach across all studies to be designed to detect the originally reported effect size with at least 80% power. Also, while the minimum power guarantee is beneficial for observing a range of possible effect sizes, the experiments in this replication, and all experiments in the project, are designed to detect the originally reported effect size with a minimum power of 80%. Thus, performing power calculations during or after data collection is not necessary in this replication attempt as all studies included are already designed to meet a minimum power or are identified beforehand as being underpowered and thus are not included in the confirmatory analysis plan. The papers by Giovanni Parmigiani and collaborators highlight the importance of accounting for variability that can occur across different studies, specifically gene expression data. While it is possible for a difference in variance between the originally reported results and the replication data this will be reflected in the presentation of the data and a possible reason for obtaining a different effect size estimate."
