It has been proposed that young but functionally integrated ABGCs (4-weeks-old) specifically contribute to pattern separation functions of the dentate gyrus due to their heightened excitability, whereas old ABGCs (&gt;8 weeks old) lose these capabilities. Measuring multiple cellular and integrative characteristics of 3- 10-week-old individual ABGCs, we show that ABGCs consist of two functionally distinguishable populations showing highly distinct input integration properties (one group being highly sensitive to narrow input intensity ranges while the other group linearly reports input strength) that are largely independent of the cellular age and maturation stage, suggesting that \u2018classmate\u2019 cells (born during the same period) can contribute to the network with fundamentally different functions. Thus, ABGCs provide two temporally overlapping but functionally distinct neuronal cell populations, adding a novel level of complexity to our understanding of how life-long neurogenesis contributes to adult brain function."

It has been proposed that young but functionally integrated ABGCs (4-weeks-old) specifically contribute to pattern separation functions of the dentate gyrus due to their heightened excitability, whereas old ABGCs (&gt;8 weeks old) lose these capabilities. Measuring multiple cellular and integrative characteristics of 3- 10-week-old individual ABGCs, we show that ABGCs consist of two functionally distinguishable populations showing highly distinct input integration properties (one group being highly sensitive to narrow input intensity ranges while the other group linearly reports input strength) that are largely independent of the cellular age and maturation stage, suggesting that \u2018classmate\u2019 cells (born during the same period) can contribute to the network with fundamentally different functions. Thus, ABGCs provide two temporally overlapping but functionally distinct neuronal cell populations, adding a novel level of complexity to our understanding of how life-long neurogenesis contributes to adult brain function."

Recent data suggested that young ABGCs (around 4 weeks old) contribute to a discrete pattern separation function, whereas older cells (8 weeks or older) are not necessary for this dentate gyrus-dependent function, therefore functionally different pools of granule cells provide unique plasticity to the hippocampal circuits (<a href=\"#bib4\">Clelland et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aimone et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alme et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Sahay et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Nakashiba et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012</a>). Current theories on adult neurogenesis are based on the provisional correlations between the two distinct physiological functions and age-dependent maturation of cellular (including synaptic, biophysical and molecular) properties (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aimone et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Sahay et al., 2011b</a>). This is supported by numerous observations showing that after their birth, ABGCs undergo a continuous maturation process, lasting for 8\u201310 weeks. ABGCs acquire neuronal properties including synaptic inputs and outputs, and capability of firing action potentials 3 to 4 weeks after their birth. Notably, ABGCs at this cellular age are highly excitable, show enhanced synaptic plasticity and are differently modulated by inhibition compared to ABGCs at the end of the maturation period (<a href=\"#bib33\">Wang et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Laplagne et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Toni et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Mongiat et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Mar\u00edn-Burgin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Vivar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Dieni et al., 2013</a>). However, it remains unknown how two populations emerge by a continuous maturation of the underlying cellular properties of ABGCs. How do individual ABGCs transform from \u2018young\u2019 to \u2018old\u2019 properties? There are three testable possibilities. First, their functionally important properties may develop continuously (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, if this is the case, it may contradict the general notion that two distinct ABGC populations exist, and ABGCs would provide a functional continuum. The second possibility is that, as during their early maturation when becoming functionally integrated (&lt;4 weeks), ABGCs switch function according to a predetermined program (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In this situation there are two clearly distinct populations and they would switch within a short temporal window at a predefined stage of their postmitotic life. Third, ABGCs may be susceptible to extrinsic cues allowing for a functional switch for an extended period (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We tested these hypotheses by resolving the integrative properties of individual ABGCs because data-pooling could mask the differences between above hypotheses. Thus, we here analyzed if (i) all cellular properties develop concomitantly, (ii) if there are biophysical properties that allow the emergence of only two populations between 3 and 10 weeks after their birth, and (iii) how and when ABGCs switch function. Using this approach, we show that ABGCs consist of two functionally distinct populations during an extended period, between 3 and 9 weeks of age in rats, by being sensitive to distinct aspects of their inputs."

During these protocols, due to the fluctuating membrane potential, the contribution of voltage-gated ionic channels to the firing is more relevant than in the case of square pulse injection. In contrast to basic membrane properties, the analysis of the gain of the input\u2013output functions of the same cells revealed two significantly distinct populations using Gaussian fits and K-means analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The input\u2013output function of the first group was characterized by a steep average slope (ASL) and highly variable (measured as the variance of the slope, VAR; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013H</a>) spike responses, suggesting that this cell population is exceptionally sensitive to certain narrow input strengths, and thus highly suited for disambiguating input\u2013output functions at single cell level (notice the out-of-average values on <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> for the first and third cells, hereafter referred to as S-group, standing for <i>Sensitive</i>). Within the S-group the integrative parameters were independent of the actual age of the individual cells (linear fits on <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) demonstrating that similar cellular functionality is maintained throughout an extended period (between 3\u20139 weeks) unless the individual cell switched to the second integration mode. This second group of ABGCs responded with constantly and incrementally increasing, less sensitive spike output (L-group; referring to <i>Linear</i>) enabling them to linearly report various input strengths. A different parameter of the input\u2013output functions, the offset did not divide the same ABGC samples into two populations, indicating that the functional separation of ABGCs is restricted to specific cellular properties (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Altogether, the above results show that ABGCs form two functionally distinct populations during a long period of their maturation based on their different sensitivity to temporally organized inputs."

With this intervention, practically the same mechanisms (such as voltage-gated channels) were available during the two recording conditions, but the cellular excitability is altered in a complex manner.

This finding is in contrast to the continuous maturation hypothesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Around the third postmitotic week, ABGCs represent a functionally homogeneous population (S-group) characterized by highly variable and sensitive output, which potentially underlies the effective disambiguation of input patterns because the output of S-group cells represent certain input ranges with exceptional efficacy. Importantly, this functional parameter is similar for an extended time period at the level of individual ABGCs, despite the continuous maturation of other biophysical parameters suggesting precise homeostatic tuning and complex interactions of the biophysical properties (<a href=\"#bib15\">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</a>). However, between the fifth and ninth week (under our experimental conditions), ABGCs switch function by losing their sensitivity to a particular input strength as their output incrementally reports a wide input range (L-group). Thus, in the theoretical case of identical input strengths and patterns to S- and L-cells (which allowed us to investigate the integrative properties of individual ABGCs in isolation), sensitivity of ABGCs in the S-group to certain input ranges, in opposed to linear reporting in cells of the L-group, allows a certain level of input disambiguation at the level of single granule cells. Furthermore, previously described distinct input rules (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dieni et al., 2013</a>) may synergistically promote two distinct functions within the ABGC populations, if these rules are specifically associated with S- or L-group properties."

Therefore, the properties of individual cell rather than the cells' age determine how certain input strengths are computed; either by, disambiguating certain input combinations (S-functionality) or by representing all of its inputs by similar rate changes toward the downstream networks (L-functionality). This observation challenges previous hypotheses on the plasticity provided by adult neurogenesis from being predominantly determined by the postmitotic cellular age and predicting similar functions of ABGCs born at the same time (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aimone et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Sahay et al., 2011b</a>).

Adult born granule cells were labeled along a broad longitudinal range (2\u20133 mm) of the hippocampi. Note that we did not find cells in animals 3\u201310 weeks after virus injection, which had &lt;3-week-old properties indicating the reliability and precision of the birth-dating method. Animals of this age were used because relatively large number of labeled ABGCs can be analyzed at a time of recording when the network properties of the dentate gyrus circuitry can be considered adult (<a href=\"#bib14\">Laplagne et al., 2006</a>). After the surgical procedure two or three siblings were housed together in large cages (75 cm \u00d7 35 cm) equipped with a running wheel, toys and shelters until the electrophysiological experiments because running is known to increase the number of surviving adult-born neurons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kempermann et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Tashiro et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dranovsky et al., 2011</a>). For acute slice preparations, rats were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and slices (300\u2013350 \u00b5m) were cut in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (consisting of 85 mM NaCl, 75 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM KCl, 25 mM glucose, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 24 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>). The orientation of cutting was perpendicular to the axis of the hippocampus at the level of virus injection. After the cutting, slices were kept at 32\u00b0C for 30 min and then at room temperature."

The epifluorescent illumination of slices was reduced as much as possible before and during the recordings in order to avoid any photo-damage of the labeled cells and usually did not last longer than few seconds above the cells. In majority of slices, in addition to birth-dated ABGCs, we also recorded non-labeled control cells, which located on the border of strata granulosum and moleculare, in order to provide controls for similar recording conditions across animals. Note that because virus injection took place always in P31\u201333 animals, their age at the time of recordings varied between P51 and P105 (corresponding to recording of 20\u201372 days old ABGCs). Notably, no correlations were found between the age of the animals and cellular properties of non-labeled control cells.

ABGCs in the early phase of their maturation (younger than 3 weeks) were not analyzed because they are not yet fully integrated into the hippocampal network due to the lack of reliable high frequency spiking, which is the consequence of lower sodium channel densities. In order to measure the input\u2013output characteristics of ABGCs during different stages of their maturation, we used sinusoidal current injection from theta to high gamma frequency bands (5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 Hz, 50 pA increment from the holding level of 0 pA, tested in random order) for 1 s and analyzed the number of the elicited action potentials. Application of sinusoidal current injections from resting membrane potential mimicked temporally correlated excitatory drives in functionally relevant frequency ranges, in opposed to square pulses, which would strongly recruit non-physiological mechanisms such as inactivation of voltage activated conductances. This type of mimicking of the excitatory drive to GCs is justified by the single supralinear integration zone of GCs (i.e., spike initiation in the axon initial segment [<a href=\"#bib13\">Krueppel et al., 2011</a>]). Furthermore, it has been reported that the amplitude of miniature excitatory events recorded at the somata does not increase further after the 3\u20134 weeks of ABGCs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mongiat et al., 2009</a>). Using somatic current injection, thus, avoids the potential confounds introduced by short-term plasticity upon repetitive stimulation of the same fibers."

The calculated parameters (average slope, variance, and offset) were weighted by the different frequencies using empirically determined correlations to obtain a pooled, frequency-independent data point from each recorded cells. Average slope (ASL) was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the first derivative of the input\u2013output function and weighted by the square root of the frequency. Frequency-weighted variance of the gain of the firing (VAR) was calculated as the variance of the first derivative of the input\u2013output function divided by the frequency. Thus, these two measures are sensitive to different aspects of the input\u2013output function of a given cell and characterize individual cells with a single and reliable value. High ASL value suggests that the given cell is capable of large output changes in response to unitary input changes, whereas the large VAR highlights that the cell is more sensitive to a particular input intensity range. Importantly, the ASL and VAR values remained stable for individual cells provided stable membrane potential, input resistance, and capacitances values and well-compensated bridge balance. These parameters were strictly monitored in every recorded trace using a 50 ms long \u221250 pA step and manually corrected if necessary and recordings were excluded if the resting membrane potential changed more than 4 mV compared to the initially measured values."

Membrane time constant was fitted with single exponential on these traces between 2\u2013100 ms both at the onset and the end of the current step. The maximum rate of rise (peak <i>d</i>V/<i>d</i>t) was measured on the first spike that was elicited using square pulse currents without post hoc filtering. Action potentials were defined as larger deflection in the first derivative of the recorded voltage trace than 20 mV/ms following post hoc low-pass filtering at 4 kHz. The maximum firing capability of the cells was challenged by 1 s long square current injections with increasing amplitude (\u039420 pA) until depolarization block was reached. Action potential threshold was measured as the voltage at 20 mV/ms of the <i>d</i>V/<i>d</i>t. The whole cell capacitance was measured in voltage clamp recordings using a \u22125 mV voltage step at \u221270 mV holding by measuring the integral area of the current response (measured from the steady-state current level) and divided by the voltage step amplitude. The offset of the input\u2013output function was defined as the peak amplitude of the current waveform necessary to reach larger firing frequency than the half of the input frequency. For normalization, we weighted the values with the fourth root of the input frequencies. Correlations are characterized with adjusted R-square (R<sup>2</sup>)."

They make two conclusions. First, they show that ABGCs display heterogeneous input-output characteristics that suggest the existence of two functional populations with distinct intrinsic integrative capabilities. Second, they show that these populations are not strictly dictated by the post mitotic age of the cell, although the probability shifts with age of the cell. The authors demonstrate the emergence of two distinct groups (\u201cR\u201d or \u201cK\u201d) independent of cellular age and intrinsic membrane properties. Whereas most adult born dentate granule cells that are 3-5 weeks of age belong to the R group (highly sensitive and variable input-output transformation), adult born dentate granule cells 9 weeks and older belong to the K group (incremental, non variable response to differing input strengths). Interestingly, 5-9 weeks old adult born dg neurons may be either R or K group members. The conclusion that adult-born neurons can display heterogeneous intrinsic properties not determined by the age of the cell is a potentially important observation that challenges the widespread assumption that the function of ABGCs depends on post mitotic cell age. However, the essence of the conclusions are based on a difference in only 1 (input-output transformation) of the 7 (mostly passive properties) measured. Without further demonstration or explanation of the underlying mechanism, it is difficult to be certain of the strong conclusions put forward by the authors without further revision."

A prior study also reported heterogeneous intrinsic excitability of \u223c4 week old cells (Dieni et al., J. Neurosci. 2014). The authors should discuss this prior work. In particular, the authors should explain why their analysis with sine wave stimuli reveals different features than are seen with conventional input resistance measurements. For example, does the sine wave activate specific voltage-gated channels? See also point 3."

The first evidence for this is provided by the experiments, in which the biophysical and integrative properties of the same granule cells of non-labeled adult rats were assessed both at physiological and lowered temperatures (28-29\u00baC). In this situation the same mechanisms are available (such as voltage-gated channels), yet, the lower temperature affected the integrative properties of the cells depending on their functional states. Specifically, the average slope of R-group cells (with low initial value) tended to increase; whereas, in case of K-cells the initially high slope value decreased (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2A</a>), as evidenced by the linear correlations.

In contrast, application of ML297, which activates GIRK channels, a known regulator of cellular excitability, specifically increased the slope in K-group like cells without affecting R-group cells (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">figure supplement 2C</a>). Thus, GIRK activation state-dependently affected the slope of the tested cells, similarly to the lower temperature, even though the two interventions has largely opposite effects on the classical measures of cellular excitability.

Therefore, for the birth-dating experiments we chose an age where there is still high number of ABGCs can be reliably detected by the virus labeling. We cannot exclude the possibility that at other ages the maturation may differ, especially, in young animals when the network itself is developing as well, which is less prominent in P30 or older animals. However, it is also important to note that the recordings of birth-dated ABGCs were performed in adult rats with the age &gt; 7 weeks. The rationale of using P31-33 old rats for the virus-labeling and the potential age dependency of the neurogenesis and maturation is highlighted in the revised manuscript.
