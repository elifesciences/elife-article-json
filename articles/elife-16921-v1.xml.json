We investigated the effects of elevated <i>pmf</i> on photosynthesis in a library of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutants with altered rates of thylakoid lumen proton efflux, leading to a range of steady-state <i>pmf</i> extents. We observed the expected <i>pmf-</i>dependent alterations in photosynthetic regulation, but also strong effects on the rate of photosystem II (PSII) photodamage. Detailed analyses indicate this effect is related to an elevated electric field (\u0394<i>\u03c8</i>) component of the <i>pmf</i>, rather than lumen acidification, which <i>in vivo</i> increased PSII charge recombination rates, producing singlet oxygen and subsequent photodamage. The effects are seen even in wild type plants, especially under fluctuating illumination, suggesting that \u0394<i>\u03c8</i>-induced photodamage represents a previously unrecognized limiting factor for plant productivity under dynamic environmental conditions seen in the field."

We investigated the effects of elevated <i>pmf</i> on photosynthesis in a library of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutants with altered rates of thylakoid lumen proton efflux, leading to a range of steady-state <i>pmf</i> extents. We observed the expected <i>pmf-</i>dependent alterations in photosynthetic regulation, but also strong effects on the rate of photosystem II (PSII) photodamage. Detailed analyses indicate this effect is related to an elevated electric field (\u0394<i>\u03c8</i>) component of the <i>pmf</i>, rather than lumen acidification, which <i>in vivo</i> increased PSII charge recombination rates, producing singlet oxygen and subsequent photodamage. The effects are seen even in wild type plants, especially under fluctuating illumination, suggesting that \u0394<i>\u03c8</i>-induced photodamage represents a previously unrecognized limiting factor for plant productivity under dynamic environmental conditions seen in the field."

In oxygenic photosynthesis, light energy is captured by pigments in light-harvesting complexes and transferred to a subset of chlorophylls in photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), where it drives the extraction of electrons from water and their transfer through redox cofactors to ultimately reduce NADP<sup>+</sup>. The vectorial transfer of electrons across the membrane is tightly coupled with the generation of the <i>pmf</i>, composed of both electric field (\u0394<i>\u03c8</i>) and pH (\u0394pH) gradients."

Acidification of the thylakoid lumen activates the photoprotective energy-dependent exciton quenching (q<sub>E</sub>) process, which dissipates excess absorbed light energy in the photosynthetic antenna complexes by the activation of violaxanthin deepoxidase (<a href=\"#bib18\">Demmig-Adams and Adams, 1992</a>) and protonation of PsbS (<a href=\"#bib48\">Li et al., 2004</a>). Lumen acidification also regulates the oxidation of plastoquinol by the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex, slowing electron transfer from PSII and preventing the accumulation of electrons on PSI, which can otherwise lead to photodamage (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nishio and Whitmarsh, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hope et al., 1994</a>). <i>In vitro</i> work has shown that excessive lumen acidification can inactivate PSII (<a href=\"#bib42\">Krieger and Weis, 1993</a>), decrease the stability of plastocyanin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gross et al., 1994</a>) and severely restrict electron flow through the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kramer et al., 1999</a>). Taken together, the <i>in vivo</i>\u00a0and <i>in vitro</i>\u00a0evidence of the susceptibility of photosynthetic components to acidification has led to the proposal that the extent of <i>pmf</i> and its partitioning into \u0394<i>\u03c8</i> and \u0394pH components is regulated to maintain the lumen pH above about 5.8, where it can regulate photoprotection. However, under environmental stresses the regulation of photosynthesis may become overwhelmed, leading to PSII damage, or photoinhibition, from lumen over-acidification, although this has not been shown to occur <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kramer et al., 1999</a>)."

Though several mechanisms have been proposed for the photodamage process, it is not known which of these operate <i>in vivo</i> under diverse environmental conditions. In addition, there are differing views on whether the extent of photoinhibition is governed by the rate of photodamage to PSII or by regulation of PSII repair (<a href=\"#bib72\">Takahashi et al., 2007</a>).

As described below, we also confirmed key aspects of the work using previously characterized ATPC1 tobacco antisense lines (<a href=\"#bib63\">Rott et al., 2011</a>). However, variations in ATP synthase suppression in the antisense lines between leaves and plant generations limited their experimental utility.

This is reflected in the higher lumen pH-sensitive q<sub>E</sub> response for a given LEF (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), which is strikingly similar to that attributed to ATP synthase regulation in wild type plants during limitations in carbon fixation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kanazawa and Kramer, 2002</a>) or decreases in ATP synthase content (<a href=\"#bib63\">Rott et al., 2011</a>). The q<sub>E</sub> sensitivities for the mutants remained similar throughout the experiments, i.e. the data for each mutant followed similar curves, implying that the ATP synthase activities were relatively constant within a particular line, consistent with a lack of light-dependent modulation of <i>g</i><sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> that has previously been observed (<a href=\"#bib3\">Avenson et al., 2005</a>). The extents of q<sub>E</sub> did not exceed about 3.5 units in any of the lines, suggesting that either the lumen pH was restricted to a moderate acidity or that the capacity of the q<sub>E</sub> response was saturated as light intensities increased."

The red and blue arrows indicate the \u0394<i>\u03c8</i>-induced changes in the\u00a0equilibrium constant for the\u00a0sharing of electrons (\u2212) between Q<sub>A</sub> and Pheo, and electron holes (+) among P<sup>+</sup> and the oxygen evolving complex. Excitation of PSII by light leads to formation of excited chlorophyll states (P*), the excitation is shared over the 4 chlorophylls and the 2 pheophytins. Charge separation occurs between more than one pair of pigments, so at short times the situation is not well defined, but Chl<sub>D1</sub><sup>+</sup>Pheo <sub>D1</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> appears to be the dominant radical pair. Secondary electron transfer events occur forming P<sub>D1</sub><sup>+</sup>Pheo<sub>D1</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>, the second radical pair, which is present in nearly all centers. This radical pair is stabilized by electron transfer from Pheo<sup>\u2212</sup> to Q<sub>A</sub> forming P<sub>D1</sub><sup>+</sup>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>. This radical pair is further stabilized by electron transfer from D1Tyr161 (TyrZ) forming a neutral tyrosyl radical, which oxidizes the Mn cluster of the oxygen evolving complex to form the state S<sub>n+1</sub>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>. Finally, Q<sub>A</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> reduces Q<sub>B</sub> to form S<sub>n+1</sub>Q<sub>B</sub><sup>-</sup>. Upon a second PSII turnover the double reduced and protonated Q<sub>B</sub> plastohydroquinone becomes protonated and is exchanged with an oxidized plastoquinone from the membrane pool (black arrows). The illustration was based on crystal structure 3WU2 (<a href=\"#bib79\">Umena et al., 2011</a>). (<b>B</b>) The charge separation states described above are unstable and recombination competes with the energy-storing reactions. When P<sub>D1</sub><sup>+</sup> is present, recombination reactions can occur by several pathways as indicated by the dashed lines: (1) direct electron transfer from Q<sub>A</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> to P<sup>+</sup> (R1); (2) by the back reaction to form the P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>\u2212</sup> state, which can then recombine directly (R2) or, (3) when the P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>\u2212</sup> radical pair is present as a triplet state, <sup>3</sup>[P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>\u2212</sup>], the dominant state when formed by the back-reaction, <sup>3</sup>[P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>\u2212</sup>] charge recombination forms <sup>3</sup>P (R3), a long lived chlorophyll triplet that can easily interact with O<sub>2</sub> to form <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>; (4) complete reversal of electron transfer can also occur, repopulating P* (R4), which can return to the ground state by emitting fluorescence (luminescence) or heat. Route 3, the triplet generating pathway, is the dominant recombination route in fully functional PSII. For\u00a0simplicity\u00a0the\u00a0<sup>3</sup>[P<sup>+</sup>Phe<sup>-</sup>] is not distinguised from the singlet form in this scheme. A \u0394<i>\u03c8</i> across the membrane should destabilize P<sup>+</sup>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> relative to the other states (see dotted blue lines), affecting the rates of reactions indicated in the green versus red. A \u0394<i>\u03c8</i> across the membrane should also destabilize P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>\u2212</sup>, but because of the smaller dielectric span across the membrane, to a lesser extent than P<sup>+</sup>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>. Thus, the buildup of \u0394<i>\u03c8</i> should shift the equilibrium constant for sharing electrons between Q<sub>A</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> and Pheo, favoring the formation of Pheo<sup>\u2212</sup> and thus increasing the rate of recombination through R3 (as well as the R2 and R4), resulting in increased production of <sup>3</sup>P\u00a0and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. Destabilization of P<sup>+</sup>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> will also increase the driving force for P<sup>+</sup>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> recombination via R1, however this recombination is already driven by 1.4eV and it is thus likely to be in the Marcus inverted region. Thus increasing the driving force will slow recombination by this route."

Red actinic illumination was used for all measurements to prevent incorrect assessment of chloroplast movement as q<sub>I</sub>, as red light is ineffective in inducing chloroplast movements (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cazzaniga et al., 2013</a>). A Stern-Volmer derivation of q<sub>E</sub> (q<sub>E(SV)</sub>) was used to minimize the contribution of q<sub>I</sub> in the determination of q<sub>E</sub> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Krause and Jahns, 2003</a>). Estimates of the relative redox status of Q<sub>A</sub> (q<sub>L</sub>) were performed as described in (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kramer et al., 2004</a>) after at least 10 min of actinic illumination.

Pre-illumination values for F<sub>0</sub> and F<sub>M</sub> were captured just prior to the beginning of the photoperiod and subsequent fluorescence parameters obtained using a 300 ms saturating actinic pulse at ~25,000 <i>\u03bc</i>mol photons m<sup>\u22122</sup>\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup> and a Red LED matrix (Luxeon Rebel SMT High Power LED Red, LXM2-PD01-0050, Philips Lumiled, San Jose, California) to measure chlorophyll which was then captured by a CCD camera (AVT Manta 145\u2009M) equipped with a near infrared long pass filter (RT-830, Hoya Glass). Plants were imaged over three consecutive 24\u2009hr photoperiods (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">videos 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media9\">9</a>, timing and light intensities are described in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). During the first day, the actinic light intensity remained constant at 100 <i>\u03bc</i>mol photons m<sup>\u22122</sup>\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup> to collect growth chamber conditions. Days two and three represented ramped lighting perturbations. The photoperiod for day two was sinusoidal, beginning at 39 \u03bcmol photons m<sup>\u22122</sup>\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup> and increasing in intensity by approximately 1.2 times every 30\u2009min until midday where it peaked at 500 <i>\u03bc</i>mol photons m<sup>\u22122</sup>\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup>,\u00a0after which the light intensity decreased at the same rate every 30\u2009min. The photoperiod for day three was sinusoidal with brief fluctuations in light intensity. Starting at 39 <i>\u03bc</i>mol photons m<sup>\u22122</sup>\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup>, the light intensity was doubled after 15\u2009min followed by 1.5-fold increase for 12\u2009min and the cycle repeated until peak intensities of 1000 and 500 <i>\u03bc</i>mol photons m<sup>\u22122</sup>\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup> were cycled through at midday, after which the sinusoidal fluctuations decreased at the same rate as the increases. Steady state values for NPQ parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence were captured prior to the ramp to the next light intensity on days two and three, or hourly on day one and calculated as noted above for the fluorescence spectroscopy. Sequences of images were captured with a 60 ms delay between images for a 15 frame total for each measurement pre- during and post-saturation flash followed by images taken to correct for artifacts due to residual electrons in the CCD array. Images were analyzed using open source software (ImageJ, NIH) modified in house to allow calculations of photosynthetic fluorescence parameters across selected regions of interest."

The amplitude of the second flash, corresponding to PSI centers capable of charge separation, was subtracted from the amplitude of the first flash, corresponding to both PSI and PSII centers capable of charge separation, to obtain the relative PSII photosystems capable of activity both before and after photoinhibition. Xenon flashes were judged to be fully saturating by ensuring that essentially identical results were obtained with a 50% weaker intensity."

The authors use a series of <i>Arabidopsis \"minira</i>\" mutants affecting the chloroplast ATP synthase \u03b3 subunit to show an unexpected relationship between the electric field (<i>\u0394\u03c8</i>) component of the <i>pmf</i> and q<sub>I</sub> (as a measure of photodamage to PSII). These results suggest a novel mechanism of PSII photoinhibition that involves an effect on PSII charge recombination, which in turn might result in increased singlet oxygen production. The data showing a correlation between <i>\u0394\u03c8</i> and q<sub>I</sub> are compelling and convincing, but the presentation and discussion of the subsequent results could be improved."

Given the very short lifetime of singlet oxygen, it seems unlikely that it could diffuse from a site of generation in the PSII reaction centers in thylakoids, through the stroma and across the double envelope membrane of the chloroplast to react with SOSG in the cytosol. Also, how quantitative are the measurements of singlet oxygen using SOSG? A very recent review of this topic (Koh and Fluhr 2016 Plant Signal Behav, in press subsequent to submission of this manuscript) indicates that one should be cautious about quantification using SOSG. Some discussion of the limitations of this probe seems warranted."

To test for this, we derived an equation (see subsection \u201cEstimation of recombination rate\u201d and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) to estimate the combined effects of Q<sub>A</sub> redox state and \u25b3<i>\u03c8</i> on recombination through P<sub>680</sub>Pheo<sup>-</sup>.
