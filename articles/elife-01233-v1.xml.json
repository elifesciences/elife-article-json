Vesicles loaded with neurotransmitter fuse with the presynaptic plasma membrane and release their contents in a process known as exocytosis. To avoid depletion of the supply of vesicles, those that have been released are then recycled through a process called endocytosis. But despite the identification of a plethora of proteins involved in endocytosis, the precise pathway by which synaptic vesicles are recycled has remained a matter of debate."

In the early 1970s, Heuser and Reese used rapid tissue freezing paired with conventional electron microscopy to try to examine these structures. By subjecting frog neuromuscular synapses to prolonged high-frequency stimulation, they obtained evidence that vesicle recycling occurs via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Heuser and Reese, 1973</a>). Their results formed the basis of a model according to which synaptic vesicles collapse fully into the plasma membrane and are subsequently recycled through the formation of membrane \u2018pits\u2019, which become surrounded by a coat protein called clathrin and bud off as new vesicles. This is a slow process, taking 10 to 20 s, and occurs at sites distant from the active zone where vesicles release their transmitter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

This occurs at sites distant from the site of fusion. (<b>B</b>) Watanabe et al. propose a new ultrafast mechanism for synaptic vesicle recycling.

Their results suggested that vesicles do not collapse fully into the membrane, but instead form a transient pore through which they release their neurotransmitter. The pore then reverses, enabling the vesicles to be rapidly recycled at their current location. This process, which has been termed \u2018kiss-and-run\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), takes less than a second and is thus much faster than clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

To uncover this pathway, Watanabe et al.\u2014who are based at the University of Utah\u2014combined the use of <i>C. elegans</i> that had been genetically modified to express a light-sensitive protein called channelrhodopsin, with rapid high-pressure freezing electron microscopy. This approach made it possible to control stimulation and freezing on a millisecond time scale, enabling the team to obtain snapshots of exocytosis and endocytosis."

These fusion events are followed within 50\u2013100 ms by the appearance of membrane invaginations much larger than a synaptic vesicle, and lateral to the centre of the fusion site. Similar structures are also seen after about 1 s at more distal sites close to the junctions with other cells. By contrast, clathrin-coated intermediates are rarely observed. Given that the appearance of these large endocytic structures is dependent upon stimulation and the prior occurrence of exocytosis, Watanabe et al. conclude that vesicle endocytosis in intact <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular synapses occurs via a novel ultrafast mechanism (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

One possibility is that synapses may have evolved separate mechanisms for retrieving the membranes of recently released vesicles, and for reforming vesicles from endocytosed material. This is consistent with the observation that vesicle recycling at highly active synapses involves the formation of endosomal intermediate structures\u2014raising the possibility that synaptic vesicles could then be regenerated from these intermediates through clathrin-dependent budding steps. Watanabe et al. may have selectively activated this rapid clathrin-independent membrane retrieval process. In this scenario, clathrin would instead be required at some later stage to turn endosomes or other endocytic structures into synaptic vesicles."

However, mutations in other <i>C. elegans</i> genes linked to clathrin-mediated endocytosis such as AP-2 induce severe presynaptic defects (<a href=\"#bib3\">Gu et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that at least some form of clathrin-mediated endocytosis is operational in worms."

While few if any neurons will encounter single stimuli, many cell types can fire at frequencies of up to 20 Hz for many seconds (<a href=\"#bib10\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, the hippocampus has been shown to contain a population of pyramidal neurons that can fire bursts of action potentials at more than 50 Hz (<a href=\"#bib4\">Harvey et al., 2009</a>), while some central synapses such as the calyx of Held can reach firing rates of more than 500 Hz (<a href=\"#bib6\">Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2008</a>). It thus seems likely that neurons can capitalize on more than one mechanism of endocytosis depending on their firing rate."
