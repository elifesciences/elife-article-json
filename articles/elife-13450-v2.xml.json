Here we investigate how the smallest unit of chromatin, a nucleosome, constrains the activity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We find that nucleosomes assembled on native DNA sequences are permissive to Cas9 action. However, the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA to Cas9 is variable over several orders of magnitude depending on dynamic properties of the DNA sequence and the distance of the PAM site from the nucleosome dyad. We further find that chromatin remodeling enzymes stimulate Cas9 activity on nucleosomal templates. Our findings imply that the spontaneous breathing of nucleosomal DNA together with the action of chromatin remodelers allow Cas9 to effectively act on chromatin <i>in vivo</i>."

Here we investigate how the smallest unit of chromatin, a nucleosome, constrains the activity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We find that nucleosomes assembled on native DNA sequences are permissive to Cas9 action. However, the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA to Cas9 is variable over several orders of magnitude depending on dynamic properties of the DNA sequence and the distance of the PAM site from the nucleosome dyad. We further find that chromatin remodeling enzymes stimulate Cas9 activity on nucleosomal templates. Our findings imply that the spontaneous breathing of nucleosomal DNA together with the action of chromatin remodelers allow Cas9 to effectively act on chromatin <i>in vivo</i>."

The method relies on a bacterial enzyme called Cas9 that can be programmed, via short guide molecules made from RNA, to target specific sites in the cell\u2019s DNA. Once bound to its target, the Cas9 enzyme cuts the DNA molecule; this often leads to changes in the DNA sequence. In nature, bacteria use the CRISPR-Cas9 system to defend themselves against viruses. However, this system also works in other cell types and can be reprogrammed to target almost any site in the DNA."

Yet, unlike in bacteria, much of the DNA in eukaryotes is wrapped around proteins called histones to form units referred to as nucleosomes. This means eukaryotic DNA is often tightly packaged, which makes it less accessible to other proteins. Nevertheless, eukaryotic DNA will spontaneously detach and reattach to the histones \u2013 a phenomenon that is commonly known as DNA \u201cbreathing\u201d. Also, protein machines known as chromatin remodelers can move, assemble and take apart the nucleosomes in eukaryotic cells. However, because there is much still to learn about how CRISPR-Cas9 works in eukaryotic cells, it is not clear how nucleosomes affect this system\u2019s activity."

In contrast, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear, packaged with histone octamers into nucleosomes, and further organized into higher-order structures (<a href=\"#bib26\">Luger et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Olins and Olins, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Woodcock et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>). The packaging of DNA into nucleosomes generally inhibits the binding of sequence specific DNA binding factors. In the simplest model, nucleosomes would analogously inhibit Cas9 action. Further, in eukaryotes ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers reposition, remove, or restructure nucleosomes to regulate the access of DNA binding factors (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Narlikar et al., 2013</a>). It can therefore be imagined that the action of remodelers also regulates the action of Cas9 on nucleosomes."

The 601 sequence is an artificially derived sequence with high affinity for the histone octamer and has proved a valuable tool for assembling well positioning nucleosomes for biochemical studies. Using sgRNAs targeting the nucleosomal dyad, entry/exit sites, and flanking DNA, we measured the rates of Cas9 cleavage with naked 601 DNA and the 601 80/80 particles. Targeting the DNA flanking the nucleosome showed cleavage rates comparable to those of naked DNA. Cleavage rates at entry/exit sites of the nucleosome were much lower compared to naked DNA (~23\u201328x decrease cleavage rate vs. DNA alone) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Targeting near the nucleosomal dyad resulted in further inhibition of cutting by Cas9 (~1000x decrease vs. DNA alone) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). Previous work has shown that nucleosomal DNA transiently disengages from the histone octamer, a process termed as nucleosomal\u00a0DNA unpeeling\u00a0or\u00a0breathing. The equilibrium for DNA unpeeling gets progressively more unfavorable the closer the DNA site gets to the dyad (<a href=\"#bib37\">Polach and Widom, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Li and Widom, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Luger et al., 2012</a>). The nucleosome-mediated inhibition of Cas9 activity is more pronounced near the dyad suggesting that Cas9 cleavage occurs on DNA that is transiently disengaged from the histone octamer."

Cas9 recognizes DNA target sites in a two-step process that begins with binding to the DNA protospacer adjacent motif (PAM, in this case 'NGG') through its C-terminal PAM-interacting region, followed by sequential melting of the DNA double strand and annealing of the sgRNA guide segment to the unwound target DNA strand (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sternberg et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Jiang et al., 2015</a>). Complete annealing of the 20-nt guide RNA to the target DNA is required to drive a progressive conformational transformation that authorizes Cas9 to simultaneously cleave both DNA strands (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sternberg et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Josephs et al., 2016</a>). Given this order of events, it is conceivable that nucleosomes can interfere with any of the steps preceding and including DNA cleavage."

We performed dCas9 binding assays using 601 0/0 nucleosomal particles which are devoid of naked DNA overhangs. Binding of dCas9 pre-loaded with core targeting sgRNA with 601 0/0 nucleosomes is undetectable whereas binding to naked DNA control is still robust (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The presence of super shifts in the gel migration pattern suggests that multiple dCas9 molcules are engaging the same DNA substrate molecule. We investigated this further and determined that, in our binding assay, the highly transient dCas9 binding to PAMs within target DNA is observable as super shifts, likely due to a combination of a high number of PAMs on the target DNA (23 NGG PAMs present in 601 0/0 sequence) and common caging effects of gel binding assays. The absence of a super shift binding pattern with 0/0 nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, right) suggests that dCas9 cannot stably interact with PAMs located on nucleosomes, in a manner consistent with a recently published study (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hinz et al., 2015</a>)."

To determine how Cas9 contends with nucleosomes assembled on this physiological positioning sequence, we performed cleavage experiments with nucleosomes assembled from 5S rRNA gene sequences from <i>Xenopus borealis</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Cas9-mediated cleavage at sites near the entry/exit of the nucleosome is substantially enhanced (700\u2013fold) with 5S nucleosomes compared to 601 particles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>). In the context of 601, cutting at this site is 1000-fold slower than in naked DNA. In contrast, with 5S nucleosomes, cutting at the comparable site is only 1.5-fold slower than in naked DNA. However, Cas9 cleavage near the dyad is inhibited to a similar extent on both 5S and 601 nucleosomes, showing that the 5S-specific enhancement of Cas9 activity does not extend all the way to the nucleosomal dyad. These results support our interpretation that nucleosomal DNA breathing substantially enhances Cas9 binding to nucleosomes and demonstrate that nucleosomal DNA sequence, through its influence on nucleosome stability, can regulate Cas9 activity over a large dynamic range."

Nucleosome positioning <i>in vivo</i> is strongly dependent on ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, which are capable of loading, repositioning, and removing nucleosomes from the chromatin fiber. To measure how chromatin remodelers can influence Cas9 activity, we performed experiments where we pre-incubated 601 nucleosomes with remodeler enzymes prior to Cas9-mediated cleavage. For our experiments with the human ISWI-family remodeler SNF2h, we used asymmetric nucleosomes that possess flanking DNA only on the entry side (601 80/0 particles). When incubated with 601 80/0 particles, SNF2h promotes sliding of the nucleosome towards the center of the DNA molecule (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib28\">L\u00e4ngst et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">He et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yang et al., 2006</a>). We then performed <i>in vitro</i> cleavage experiments where 80/0 particles, pre-remodeled with SNF2h, were incubated with Cas9:sgRNA complex with its target site located within the nucleosome exit region. Remodeling 80/0 nucleosomes by SNF2h resulted in a strong enhancement of Cas9 cleavage to ~34%, showing that SNF2h slides the nucleosome enough to improve Cas9\u2019s accessibility to the target site and that Cas9 is now able to bind and cleave at a higher rate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>)."

To determine if the types of remodeled products generated influence Cas9 activity, we performed similar experiments using 601 80/80 particles and the yeast chromatin remodeler RSC. We find that RSC activity also dramatically enhances cleavage on 601 80/80 nucleosomes when Cas9 is targeted to the entry site, negating most of the inhibitory influence of the nucleosome on Cas9 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013F</a>). These results demonstrate that two different classes of chromatin remodeling enzymes can significantly enhance Cas9 access to DNA targets normally obscured by nucleosomes."

Recent work using nucleosomes assembled on the 601 sequence has led to the qualitatively similar conclusion that nucleosomes are refractory for Cas9 action (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hinz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Horlbeck et al., 2016</a>). The comparison here between Cas9 action on 601 nucleosomes vs. nucleosomes assembled on the native 5S sequence suggests a more refined model for how nucleosomes regulate Cas9 action. We find that Cas9 sites near the entry/exit sites of 5S nucleosomes are cleaved ~700-fold better than the corresponding sites within 601 nucleosomes. Given that DNA breathing occurs at least 100-fold more in 5S nucleosomes than 601 nucleosomes we propose that Cas9 gains access to nucleosomal DNA when the DNA is transiently unpeeled from the histone octamer. This model also explains why sites closer to the entry/exit sites are cut more readily by Cas9 than sites near the dyad. This is because DNA unpeeling up to the dyad is substantially less favored (100-fold) for both the 601 and 5S nucleosomes than DNA unpeeling near their respective entry/exit sites (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anderson and Widom, 2000</a>)."

Chromatin remodeling enzymes can move nucleosomes away or towards the factor binding sites to respectively enhance or inhibit factor binding. We find that Cas9 activity can also benefit from chromatin remodeling to access nucleosomal DNA, as evidenced by the strong enhancements of Cas9 cleavage resulting from the action of the chromatin remodelers SNF2h and RSC. These two remodelers produce distinct nucleosomal arrangements yet still substantially alleviate nucleosome-mediated occlusion of Cas9 activity."

Chromatin remodeling activities can further provide diverse mechanisms to potentiate Cas9 activity at sites located close to the nucleosomal dyad or within more strongly positioned nucleosomes, which would otherwise be refractory to Cas9 action. We hypothesize that the combination of spontaneous DNA unpeeling and remodeling contributes to the widespread success of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells."

It is also conceivable that Cas9 can temporarily gain access to less accessible regions of the genome during specific points of cell cycle (e.g. DNA replication), leading to sufficient DNA cleavage events to promote NHEJ-mediated mutagenesis or HDR-mediated DNA integration at appreciable rates. Recent studies on Cas9\u2019s behavior by single molecule imaging have also demonstrated that Cas9 favors more accessible euchromatin regions but is not completely excluded from transcriptionally silent heterochromatin (<a href=\"#bib21\">Knight et al., 2015</a>). For other CRISPR applications that require stable binding of nuclease-deficient dCas9 to DNA, such as transcriptional regulation and live-cell imaging with fluorescent dCas9, even modest nucleosome phasing could have a dramatic impact (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gilbert et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mali et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ma et al., 2015</a>). For example, the +1 nucleosome in RNA pol II-transcribed genes is strongly positioned with phasing that dissipates gradually with each following nucleosome. Several high resolution studies conducted in parallel to our work have established that the +1 nucleosome and resulting nucleosome phasing can exert a strong influence on dCas9\u2019s DNA-binding ability for transcriptional regulation, but the effect is less striking on genome editing with Cas9 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Horlbeck et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Smith et al., 2016</a>)."

Cas9:sgRNA complexes were reconstituted by incubating Cas9 and sgRNA for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. Reactions contained 5 nM fluorescein labeled DNA or nucleosomes and 100 nM Cas9:sgRNA. In combined cleavage and remodeling experiments, 25 nM SNF2h or 3 nM RSC was first incubated with 5 nM naked DNA or nucleosomes for 45 min at 37\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib33\">Narlikar et al., 2001</a>). Cleavage assays were carried out in reaction buffer (20\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 70\u2009mM KCl, 5\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5% Glycerol, and 1\u2009mM DTT) at 25\u00b0C. For SNF2h and RSC remodeling experiments, 0.2\u2009mM ATP was also added. For RSC remodeling experiments, 1\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was used. Time points were quenched using stop buffer (20\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 70\u2009mM EDTA, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.2 mg/mL xylene cyanol and bromophenol blue). Proteins were digested with 3 mg/mL of Proteinase K and incubated at 50\u00b0C for 20 min. Samples were resolved on 1x TBE, 10% Polyacrylamide gels for 4\u2009hr at 140\u00a0V before visualizing using a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare) and quantifying with Image\u00a0J (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>). For band quantification, background intensity was first subtracted after averaging the intensity of three areas. For cleavage gels, fraction uncleaved was determined by measuring the intensity of the uncleaved band compared to the total intensity for the lane. Similarly, fraction unbound was determined by measuring the intensity of the unbound band compared to the total intensity for the lane."

This more comprehensive picture of Cas9 interactions with nucleosomes provides an explanation for why Cas9 has empirically proven so successful in accessing many endogenous loci. This model also provides ideas for how one can optimally pick Cas9 targets or how accessibility could be improved.

In contrast to SNF2h, which only slides nucleosomes away from DNA ends, RSC generates a wider range of remodeled products that are thought to include nucleosomes with DNA loops in addition to nucleosomes with different translational positions. We find that RSC activity also enhances Cas9 cleavage and has a larger stimulatory effect than SNF2h, bringing the rate of cutting to nearly the same level as on naked DNA."

For Cas9 targets that are either present closer to the dyad of the nucleosome or present within nucleosomes occupying strong positioning sequences, chromatin remodeling activities can provide diverse mechanisms to potentiate Cas9 activity."

Because of the widely observed differences in activity of different gRNAs, it is important to study different gRNAs and determine that the results shown here are not unique to one or more particular targets. A similar problem is shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, where the experiment is designed to study the variable of position within the nucleosome, but the variable of sequence identity of the target site is also changing and therefore convoluting the results. Since only a single target DNA strand was analyzed, it's difficult to generalize the observations. It would strengthen the conclusions to evaluate target site position independent of sequence.</i>"

To control for the intrinsic variations introduced by the different guide RNA sequences we always normalize nucleosome cleavage rates for each individual sgRNA to their rates on the naked DNA target (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This normalization isolates nucleosome specific effects on Cas9 activity, allowing comparisons across multiple nucleosome positions. We have better clarified the normalization procedure in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, the activity of the sgRNAs used in our experiments was confirmed using cleavage assays with naked DNA. sgRNA designs found to be substantially less effective were replaced with alternative designs with similar target sites in order to preserve the dynamic range of our experiments."

Our results indicate that Cas9 can readily act at the entry/ exit sites of nucleosomes assembled on native DNA sequences like 5S by taking advantage of DNA breathing. We speculate that when dCas9 accesses such sites, its slow off rate keeps the unpeeled DNA from re-annealing with the histone octamer, thus making the histones more susceptible to disassembly by cellular histone chaperones or chromatin remodelers."

Furthermore, a higher resolution study on Cas9 editing/gene regulation efficiencies <i>in vivo</i> using purposefully designed, high density sgRNA libraries over a large number of genes is described in a parallel studies in human cells (Horlbeck and Witkowsky et al., <i>eLife</i>, 2016) and in yeast (Smith et al., Genome Biology, 2016) where the authors find that Cas9 function is negatively correlated with nucleosome positioning.
