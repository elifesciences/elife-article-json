The stability of mRNAs, as for all types of RNA molecules, can be compromised by the presence of stop codons in positions that are \u201cinappropriate\u201d. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is the pathway that degrades such transcripts (<a href=\"#bib6\">Lykke-Andersen and Jensen, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012</a>). The mechanisms that allow a \"normal\" stop codon to be distinguished from a stop codon that induces nonsense-mediated decay are still unclear: however, RNA molecules that are sensitive to nonsense-mediated decay are in general characterized by a short coding sequence followed by a long untranslated region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

Some NMD substrates also have an annotated ORF (middle). Short ORFs followed by relatively long 3'UTRs are also randomly present in incorrectly spliced mRNA transcripts (bottom). (<b>B</b>) Three examples of phenotypic traits observed in the absence of NMD; each trait is mediated by the stabilization of the mRNA shown in the second column. The first two links were observed in yeast (<a href=\"#bib3\">Johansson and Jacobson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Addinall et al., 2011</a>); the last was observed by Nelson et al. in flies."

Since this pathway affects thousands of different transcripts, it is not clear what makes it essential for the survival of so many species. Are its effects important for only one or very few transcripts, or is it important because of the cumulative degradation of a large number of potentially harmful mRNA transcripts? Now, in eLife, Mark Metzstein and colleagues at the University of Utah \u2013 including Jonathan Nelson as first author <i>\u2013</i> present new evidence that strengthens the hypothesis that the\u00a0lethality caused by inactivating the NMD pathway results from the stabilization of a small number of mRNA transcripts (<a href=\"#bib8\">Nelson et al., 2016</a>)."

Third, the genetic screen performed by Nelson et al. also showed that inactivating a protein kinase called Mekk1 \u2013 which is the best-known target of Gadd45 \u2013 could also improve the survival of the fruit fly embryos."

The partial nature of this reversal might be explained by the fact that mammals have three genes for GADD45, whereas flies only have one. However, it could also indicate that other targets of the NMD pathway contribute to the loss of viability."

One can imagine nonsense-mediated decay somehow being a link between the high turnover rate of these transcripts and the translation of these transcripts to produce the Gadd45 protein. For example, a form of stress could temporarily repress the translation process, leading to the accumulation of GADD45 mRNA transcripts. Then, when the cells were relieved of the stress, the accumulated transcripts would produce a burst of Gadd45 proteins that could modulate the ability of the cell to respond to any future stress."

It is more difficult to assign a phenotype to the global destabilization of hundreds or thousands of transcripts by nonsense-mediated decay, as we cannot delete all the corresponding genes to see which phenotype is suppressed.

Mapping of transcription start sites in yeast showed that a large variety of RNA molecules are synthesized in parallel with mRNA but are rapidly degraded via nonsense-mediated decay. The regions from which these identified transcripts originate have sequence characteristics biased to favor rapid decay of the aberrant transcripts. That such aberrant transcripts are only tolerated if they become substrates for nonsense-mediated decay is an example of global destabilization being subject to evolutionary selection."
