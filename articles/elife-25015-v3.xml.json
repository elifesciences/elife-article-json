Here, we genetically deleted <i>Srebf-2</i> from hepatocytes and confirmed that SREBP-2 regulates all genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, the LDL receptor, and PCSK9; a secreted protein that degrades LDL receptors in the liver. Surprisingly, we found that elimination of <i>Srebf-2</i> in hepatocytes of mice also markedly reduced SREBP-1c and the expression of all genes involved in FA and triglyceride synthesis that are normally regulated by SREBP-1c. The nuclear receptor LXR is necessary for <i>Srebf-1c</i> transcription. The deletion of <i>Srebf-2</i> and subsequent lower sterol synthesis in hepatocytes eliminated the production of an endogenous sterol ligand required for LXR activity and SREBP-1c expression. These studies demonstrate that cholesterol and FA synthesis in hepatocytes are coupled and that flux through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is required for the maximal SREBP-1c expression and high rates of FA synthesis."

Here, we genetically deleted <i>Srebf-2</i> from hepatocytes and confirmed that SREBP-2 regulates all genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, the LDL receptor, and PCSK9; a secreted protein that degrades LDL receptors in the liver. Surprisingly, we found that elimination of <i>Srebf-2</i> in hepatocytes of mice also markedly reduced SREBP-1c and the expression of all genes involved in FA and triglyceride synthesis that are normally regulated by SREBP-1c. The nuclear receptor LXR is necessary for <i>Srebf-1c</i> transcription. The deletion of <i>Srebf-2</i> and subsequent lower sterol synthesis in hepatocytes eliminated the production of an endogenous sterol ligand required for LXR activity and SREBP-1c expression. These studies demonstrate that cholesterol and FA synthesis in hepatocytes are coupled and that flux through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is required for the maximal SREBP-1c expression and high rates of FA synthesis."

To generate the active nuclear form of SREBPs, SREBP/Scap dissociates from Insig, and the complex moves from the ER to the Golgi where two proteases, designated S1P and S2P, sequentially cleave SREBPs releasing the amino-terminal fragment, which travels to the nucleus to activate regulated genes."

In most tissues, the predominant SREBP-1 isoform expressed is SREBP-1c (<a href=\"#bib26\">Shimomura et al., 1997</a>). Overexpression of nuclear SREBP-1c (nSREBP-1c) in livers of mice resulted in the transcriptional activation of genes involved in FA and triglyceride (TG) synthesis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Horton et al., 2002</a>). As a consequence of increased de novo lipogenesis, mice expressing nSREBP-1c developed fatty livers. Consistent with the role of SREBP-1c in activating lipogenesis, SREBP-1c is activated in the liver by insulin through a partially defined pathway that involves the insulin receptor, Akt, and mTORC1 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Owen et al., 2012</a>). Conversely, genetic deletion of <i>Srebf-1c</i> led to a selective reduction in the expression of genes involved in FA and TG synthesis (<a href=\"#bib14\">Liang et al., 2002</a>)."

The absence of SREBP-2 lead to reduced LXR activity, which explained the loss of SREBP-1c expression, possibly owing to the loss of an endogenous sterol ligand that is dependent on flux through the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway."

To test this hypothesis, we first fed mice a synthetic ligand for LXR, <i>T</i>0901317.

Increased SREBP-1c expression was associated with higher mRNA levels of ACC1 and FAS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Inasmuch as LXR can independently transcriptionally activate the same FA synthesis genes, we verified that the induction of ACC1 and FAS was specifically due to SREBP-1c by feeding mice that lack all SREBPs as a result of the deletion of <i>Scap</i> the LXR agonist (<a href=\"#bib18\">Moon et al., 2012</a>).

PCSK9 is a secreted protein that degrades LDLRs in liver (<a href=\"#bib12\">Lagace et al., 2006</a>). In livers of hepatocyte-<i>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, the reduction in LDLR production was balanced by the reduction in PCSK9-mediated LDLR destruction, which ultimately led to no measurable change in steady-state LDLR protein levels (data not shown). Nevertheless, plasma cholesterol levels in hepatocyte-<i>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice were still 50% lower than those measured in WT mice (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). To determine whether lower plasma cholesterol levels were a result of increased clearance of apoB-containing lipoproteins, we measured the <sup>125</sup>I-labeled LDL clearance. LDL was isolated from LDL receptor knockout mice and labeled the apoB with <sup>125</sup>I (<a href=\"#bib4\">Horton et al., 1999</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, the clearance of LDL was identical in WT and hepatocyte-<i>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice.

Deletion of <i>Srebf-2</i> in hepatocytes reduced the expression of all cholesterol biosynthetic genes and rates of hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Despite the deficiency in liver cholesterol content, no apparent additional mechanisms are present in the\u00a0livers capable of restoring cholesterol levels to normal in the absence of SREBP-2. The unexpected finding in <i>Srebf-2</i> knockout livers was the marked reduction of SREBP-1c expression and genes involved in FA synthesis. While this manuscript was in preparation, Vergnes <i>et al</i>. (<a href=\"#bib30\">Vergnes et al., 2016</a>) also reported that SREBP-1c expression and its regulated genes were reduced in livers of SREBP-2 hypomorphic mice. Here, dietary supplementation of cholesterol or an LXR agonist restored SREBP-1c expression and the mRNAs encoding the FA biosynthetic enzymes, which suggests that the loss of flux through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway results in the loss of an endogenous LXR ligand required for normal LXR activity."

Coupling cholesterol and FA synthesis may be important for the efficient esterification of cholesterol since oleic acid is the preferred substrate for the cholesterol esterifying enzyme ACAT (<a href=\"#bib31\">Yang et al., 1997</a>).

Supplementation of a synthetic LXR ligand or feeding cholesterol were both capable of restoring the\u00a0SREBP-1c expression indicating that LXR was present and that if a ligand was provided it was capable of normally activating <i>Srebf-1c</i> transcription in the SREBP-2 deficient mice.

The only molecular signature we found that differed between hepatocyte-<i>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></i> and hepatocyte-<i>Scap<sup>-/-</sup></i> livers was the retained expression of SREBP-1a and ACC2 in the\u00a0livers of hepatocyte-<i>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. These studies confirm that SREBP-1a has only a minor role in regulating basal and stimulated cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the\u00a0liver. The phenotypic similarities between hepatocyte-<i>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></i> and hepatocyte-<i>Scap<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice also suggest that blocking SREBP-2 action would be effective in preventing the development of hepatic steatosis in mice with insulin resistance and/or diabetes. The markedly reduced expression of lipogenic genes in hepatocyte-<i>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></i> livers and the blunted response of these genes to refeeding a high carbohydrate diet suggest that blocking SREBP-2 action would also be effective in preventing the development of hepatic steatosis induced by hyperinsulinemia, similar to the results obtained in Scap deficient mice that also lack leptin (<a href=\"#bib18\">Moon et al., 2012</a>)."

Inasmuch as LDL clearance was not altered in hepatocyte-<i>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, the reduced LDLR protein destruction by PCSK9 likely offset the reduced LDLR production since LDL clearance from the plasma of hepatocyte-<i>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice was not lower.

The blunted PNPLA3 expression in livers of hepatocyte-<i>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice was likely due to the accompanying loss of SREBP-1c since feeding the hepatocyte-<i>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice diets supplemented with an LXR agonist or cholesterol (data not shown) restored SREBP-1c and PNPLA3 expression. Studies by Hobbs and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib13\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Smagris et al., 2015</a>) previously demonstrated that high expression levels of the mutant PNPLA3 protein are required for the development of hepatic steatosis in mice.

The physiological changes that result from deleting <i>Srebf-2</i> mirror that of mice that lack Scap in hepatocytes since we show that SREBP-2 expression is required to produce an LXR ligand required for normal SREBP-1c expression. The resulting phenotypes suggest that the inhibition of SREBP-2 or Scap in the\u00a0liver, which reduces cholesterol and FA synthesis, may be therapeutically advantageous for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease."

Exon 1 encodes the first 29 amino acids of <i>Srebf-2</i>. The conditional targeting vector was constructed in five steps as follows: (1) A 1.1 kb fragment of intron 1 was generated by PCR from SM-1 ES cell genomic DNA with 5\u2019 primers that contained a HindIII sequence and a <i>loxP</i> site, and a 3\u2019 primer that contained a SalI sequence (5\u2019 primer, 5\u2019-AAAAAAGCTTATAACTTCGTATAATGTATGCTATACGAAGTTATCCCGAAGCGGGGCTGGGGGCGTCGCGAG-3\u2019 and 3\u2019 primer, 5\u2019-AAAAAGTCGACTTGTCACACTGTCTGGATGACCAAAATG-3\u2019). This fragment was used as the short arm. (2) The HindIII- SalI fragment of the short arm and a BamHI-HindIII fragment containing a <i>loxP;frt</i> flanked <i>pgk-neo-pA</i> cassette excised from pGEMFRTNEO (provided by Joachim Herz, UT Southwestern) were ligated into the BamHI-SalI sites of pGEM-11Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI), yielding plasmid pBP2-KO1.

It was generated by PCR using 5\u2019 primers that contained a NotI site and a <i>loxP</i> site, and 3\u2019 primer that contained a BamHI site (5\u2019 primer, 5\u2019-AAAAAGCGGCCGCATAACTTCGTATAATGTATGCTATACGAAGTTATGATGCAGTGAGGTGACTGCAGGAGTGGG-3\u2019) and 3\u2019 primer, 5\u2019-AAAAAGGATCCCCGCGGCGCCCACGACTCCTCAG-3\u2019). The NotI-BamHI fragment of the middle arm was ligated into the NotI and BamHI sites of pBP2-KO1, yielding plasmid pBP2-KO2. (4) Two copies of <i>hsv-tk</i> cassette were inserted into the SalI site of pBP2-KO2, yielding pBP2-KO3. (5) The long arm is a 7 kb fragment upstream of the promoter region of the <i>Srebf-2</i>. It was prepared by PCR using TaKaRa LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo, Shiga, Japan). The following NotI-containing PCR primers were used for amplification: 5\u2019 primer, 5\u2019-AAAAAGCGGCCGCCTTGGTGAGGGCAGGCTGCAGGCCACTG-3\u2019 and 3\u2019 primer, 5\u2019-AAAAAGCGGCCGCATCTTACAGGTAGTCGGTCACACTGCACAC-3\u2019). The PCR fragment was digested with NotI and inserted into the NotI site of pBP2-KO3, resulting in the final <i>Srebf-2</i> conditional targeting vector, designated pBP2-KO4.

Briefly, recipient mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and received a bolus of 0.1 ml of saline containing 15 \u00b5g of <sup>125</sup>I-LDL (496 cpm/ng protein;\u00a0~53% labeled on apo B) via the right jugular vein.

The authors found that elimination of SREBP-2 in liver significantly reduced the activity of the SREBP-1c pathway and the expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis regulated by SREBP- 1c. Feeding mice with either LXR ligand or high cholesterol diet relieved SREBP-1c suppression. These data suggested that deletion of SREBP-2 reduced the production of an endogenous sterol ligand required for LXR activity and SREBP-1c expression. A puzzling aspect is that putative in vivo LXR oxysterol ligands are not reduced in the SREBP-2 KO livers and some oxysterol species are even higher in the KO. In general, the data presented in this manuscript is clear, and is consistent with the hypothesis put forward by the authors."

The purpose of the LDL clearance study (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), was simply to demonstrate that there was no increased clearance of LDL-C since the deletion of SREBP-2 effected the expression of the LDLR and PSCSK9. The fact that there was no difference supports the results of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and C</a> that showed there was a marked reduction in VLDL production and we feel this is the most likely cause of the lower plasma lipid levels.
