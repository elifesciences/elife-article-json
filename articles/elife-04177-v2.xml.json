Natural killer (NK) cells are essential tumor-killing effector cells of the innate immune system; however, little is known about whether or how other immune cells recognize tumor cells to assist NK cells. Here, we show that the innate immune receptor Dectin-1 expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages is critical to NK-mediated killing of tumor cells that express N-glycan structures at high levels. Receptor recognition of these tumor cells causes the activation of the IRF5 transcription factor and downstream gene induction for the full-blown tumoricidal activity of NK cells. Consistent with this, we show exacerbated in vivo tumor growth in mice genetically deficient in either Dectin-1 or IRF5. The critical contribution of Dectin-1 in the recognition of and signaling by tumor cells may offer new insight into the anti-tumor immune system with therapeutic implications."

Natural killer (NK) cells are essential tumor-killing effector cells of the innate immune system; however, little is known about whether or how other immune cells recognize tumor cells to assist NK cells. Here, we show that the innate immune receptor Dectin-1 expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages is critical to NK-mediated killing of tumor cells that express N-glycan structures at high levels. Receptor recognition of these tumor cells causes the activation of the IRF5 transcription factor and downstream gene induction for the full-blown tumoricidal activity of NK cells. Consistent with this, we show exacerbated in vivo tumor growth in mice genetically deficient in either Dectin-1 or IRF5. The critical contribution of Dectin-1 in the recognition of and signaling by tumor cells may offer new insight into the anti-tumor immune system with therapeutic implications."

The discovery of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other classes of signal-transducing innate immune receptors exemplifies a model of pathogen recognition by germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system that detect components of invading pathogens, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blasius and Beutler, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kawai and Akira, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2011</a>). Upon recognition of PAMPs, these receptors activate NF-\u03baB, interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and other transcription factors, which then induce the transcription of cognate target genes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tamura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ikushima et al., 2013</a>). This results in the evocation of innate immune responses that also instruct subsequent innate immune responses. Dead or injured cells also recruit and activate innate inflammatory cells in the absence of infection through recognition by PRRs of released self-derived molecules termed damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bianchi, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rubartelli and Lotze, 2007</a>). To date, the role of innate immune receptors in anti-tumor innate immune response is unknown."

NK cells are sub-classified into circulating conventional NKs (cNKs) and tissue-resident NKs (trNKs) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sojka et al., 2014</a>). Thus far, most of the functional studies on NK cells have focused on cNKs, which are found to be abundant in the spleen. In view of the critical role of cNKs (referred to as NKs hereafter unless stated otherwise) in anti-tumor innate immunity, the interesting issue for whether PRRs expressed on NK and/or other immune cells may recognize tumor cells for the enhancement of tumoricidal activity of NK cells. It has been reported that cell-to-cell contact between dendritic cells (DCs) and resting NK cells causes an enhancement of NK cell-mediated cytolytic activity against tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fernandez et al., 1999</a>); however, the involvement of PRRs in this context remains unknown. Of note, some TLRs appear to have the opposite effect (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rakoff-Nahoum and Medzhitov, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pradere et al., 2014</a>). For instance, activation of TLR2 and TLR6 in macrophages enhances metastasis of tumor cells, wherein receptor activation is mediated by tumor cell-derived versican, an extracellular matrix proteoglycan that is up-regulated in many tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2009</a>)."

Since IRF5 is known to be activated by TLRs and other classes of PRRs, we asked whether any of these PRRs is involved in this process in the context of NK cell-mediated control of tumor cells. In light of the tumor-promoting effect by TLRs (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rakoff-Nahoum and Medzhitov, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pradere et al., 2014</a>), we hypothesized that another class of PRRs expressed on the cell surface may be involved in the recognition of tumor cells for the NK cell-mediated anti-tumor response. Dectin-1, a C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family member known to recognize \u03b2-glucans of fungal cell wall (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown, 2006</a>), was of particular interest since (i) it is highly expressed in macrophages and DCs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Herre et al., 2004</a>) and (ii) IRF5 is involved in Dectin-1 signaling for anti-fungal innate immune response (<a href=\"#bib10\">del Fresno et al., 2013</a>)."

Further, we demonstrate that IRF5 is activated by Dectin-1 signaling in these immune cells and that this Dectin-1-IRF5 pathway constitutes a critical limb for their orchestration of NK cells. We also provide evidence that tumor cell-mediated Dectin-1 signaling is instigated by receptor recognition of N-glycan structures on the surface of some but not all tumor cells, which we propose to term tumor-associated molecular patterns (TAMPs). Finally, the in vivo significance of these observations is validated by the massive growth of the TAMP-expressing tumors in mice genetically deficient for either Dectin-1 or IRF5."

Although IRF5 is best known as a transcription factor activated by TLR signaling, we observed that splenocytes from mice deficient in MyD88, the common adapter for all TLRs, shows killing activity against B16 cells at a rate even slightly higher than those from WT mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We then focused our attention on Dectin-1, a member of the CLR family, which is expressed on the cell surface of innate immune cells. In fact, Dectin-1, known to recognize \u03b2-glucans of fungal cell wall (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown, 2006</a>), is widely expressed by DCs and macrophages and the activation of IRF5 by the Dectin-1-Syk pathway has been implicated in the induction of type I interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) gene upon fungal infection (<a href=\"#bib10\">del Fresno et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Leibundgut-Landmann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Backer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brown et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Honda and Taniguchi, 2006</a>)."

Interestingly, we observed nuclear translocation of IRF5, a hallmark of its activation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Honda and Taniguchi, 2006</a>), following incubation of WT splenocytes with B16 cells (in 50 to 1 or 100 to 1 cell ratio), but not in splenocytes from mice deficient in the <i>Clec7a</i> gene that encodes Dectin-1 (hereafter Dectin-1-deficient mice), indicating there is a Dectin-1 signal-dependent IRF5 activation by the tumor cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Of note, IRF5 activation by B16 cells was not inhibited by FK506, suggesting there is a calcineurin-independent pathway for this activation (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As such, these data support a Dectin-1 signal-dependent IRF5 activation by tumor cells."

In this context, it has been shown that enhanced glycosylation levels provide growth advantages to many if not all tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Granovsky et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gu and Taniguchi, 2008</a>). Interestingly, we found that sDectin-1 binding to B16 cells was markedly reduced upon N-glycosidase treatment, while treatment by O-glycosidase or neuraminidase showed only a marginal effect, suggesting there is a major requirement for N-glycan structures to Dectin-1 binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Consistent with this, a marked reduction of tumoricidal activity of splenocytes was observed when B16 cells were pretreated with N-glycosidase, whereas O-glycosidase treatment did not affect this activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Further, N-glycosidase treatment of B16 cells did not affect the in vitro killing activity of purified NK cells (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), indicating in toto there is a critical role of Dectin-1 recognition of and signaling by N-glycan structures on tumor cells by DCs and macrophages."

The affected genes include several membrane-bound proteins amongst which <i>Inam</i> (termed as <i>Fam26f</i>) is known to activate NK cells via its homophilic interaction (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ebihara et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, the <i>Inam</i> mRNA induction by B16 cells is IRF5-dependent in splenic CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) and lentiviral expression of INAM cDNA in bone marrow-derived DCs resulted in the enhancement of NK cell-mediated killing of B16 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Thus, the Dectin-1-IRF5-INAM pathway may participate in the DC-mediated activation of NK cells, at least in part, in this experimental setting. Obviously, more detailed analyses will be required to gain further mechanistic insight into the enhancement of NK-mediated tumor control by DCs and macrophages."

However, it has been enigmatic if and how these receptors contribute to anti-tumor responses. In the present study, we demonstrated that the innate immune receptor Dectin-1 expressed on DCs and macrophages is important to NK-mediated killing of tumor cells. Our results indicate that NK cells are required to orchestrate with DCs and macrophages for cell killing, wherein activation of the IRF5 transcription factor by Dectin-1 signaling instigated by receptor recognition of N-glycan structures on tumor cells is critical. This notion is supported by an excessive growth of tumors with sDectin-1 binding in mice genetically deficient in either Dectin-1 or IRF5 in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an innate immune receptor contributes to anti-tumor recognition and signaling through orchestration of innate immune cells. Our study offers new insight into the NK-mediated anti-tumor activity of the innate immune system (model depicted in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

It is curious that in many tumor cells glycosylation levels are generally enhanced, providing an advantage to tumor cells in migration and metastasis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Granovsky et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gu and Taniguchi, 2008</a>).

Although the conventional wisdom has been that Fc receptors (FcRs) expressed on NK cells are responsible for ADCC, primarily based on in vitro studies using human mononuclear cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alderson and Sondel, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Seidel et al., 2013</a>), it has been appreciated for some time that in the mouse, Ab mediated tumor killing is mediated primarily by myeloid cells. For example, mouse IgG2a is the most potent Ab isotype for the activation of effector cells through its intermediate\u2013affinity interaction with FcRIV (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nimmerjahn et al., 2010</a>). Yet, this FcR is not expressed by NK cells, but is expressed by DCs and macrophages (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nimmerjahn et al., 2005</a>). It is also interesting to note that FcRIV utilizes FcR\u03b3, the FcR common \u03b3 subunit, to transmit the Ab signal to the cell interior via pathways similar, if not identical, to those of CLRs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Honda and Taniguchi, 2006</a>). As such, Abs may activate DCs and macrophages via FcRIV-FcR\u03b3 pathway to mediate both ADCC and further contribute to NK cell activation through a mechanism similar to the pathway we describe in this study. The process may be termed \u2018indirect ADCC\u2019.

Briefly, MEFs were infected with MCMV and incubated for 72 hr until the cell layer was completely infected. Then, the cells and supernatant were collected and were subjected to three freeze-and-thaw cycles to release cell-associated virus. The crude virus-containing medium was centrifuged and filtrated with a sterile 0.45 \u00b5m pore size filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). MCMV in the filtrated medium was concentrated by centrifugation at 26,000\u00d7<i>g</i> (15,000 rpm; Beckman SW 41 Ti rotor) for 3 hr at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in PBS and filtrated through a sterile 0.45 \u00b5m filter. MCMV titer was determined by plaque-forming cell assay. MEFs were infected with serially diluted (log<sub>10</sub> steps) virus stock solution or organ homogenates and incubated for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C. Then, the cells were washed extensively and cultured in 2.4% methylcellulose-containing DMEM supplemented with 4% FCS for 5 days. After incubation, cells were fixed with formalin and stained with crystal violet solution. Virus plaques were then counted. WT and <i>Dectin-1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice were intraperitoneally infected with MCMV (5 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> or 3 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> pfu). For NK depletion, WT mice were given anti-asialo GM1 antibody intravenously one day before infection. Mice were sacrificed at 3 days postinfection and spleens from the mice were excised and homogenized in PBS."

The cDNA was excised by <i>Xho</i>I and <i>Not</i>I digestion, blunted, and inserted into the blunted <i>Not</i>I site of pCSII-EF-MCS-IRES2-Venus vector (pCSII-EF-INAM). A total of 5 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> HEK293T cells were seeded on 10-cm dishes 24 hr prior to transfection. pCSII-EF (6 \u00b5g) or pCSII-EF-INAM (6 \u00b5g) vector in combination with pMDLg/pRRE (6 \u00b5g) and pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev (6 \u00b5g) vectors was co-transfected into HEK293T cells.

The transduction efficiency was assessed by fluorescence of Venus ligated in the lentivirus vector, and the frequency of positive cells determined by flow cytometry in comparison with that of non-infected cells. Briefly, serially diluted viral solution was added to BMDCs (3 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cell/500 \u00b5l of RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS with 4 \u00b5g/ml polybrene [Sigma] in 24-well plate), centrifuged at 1200\u00d7<i>g</i> (2360 rpm; TOMY LX-141) for 90 min at 30\u00b0C, and incubated for 3 hr. These cells were cultured for 20 hr additionally in fresh medium after wash. Then, the fluorescence intensities of the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The appropriate viral titer was determined so as to reach 90% Venus expression in BMDCs and was used for the experiments."

Accordingly, we examined mRNA expression levels for typical inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators in the co-culture system, wherein the ratio of B16F1 cells, DCs, and NK cells is 1:30:10. Total RNA was isolated at zero time and 4 hrs after the co-culture and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis. We found that the mRNA levels for inflammatory cytokines, namely, IFN-g, IL-6, TNF-a remained unchanged between the co-culture with WT DCs and Dectin-1-deficient DCs. Moreover, we did not find any differences in mRNA expression for cytotoxic mediators such as granzyme B and perforin-1. These results are now presented as <a href=\"#fig2s8\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 8</a>. As such, from these analyses, it seems unlikely that Dectin-1 signaling in DCs affects the expression of these molecules in NK cells. We agree that how NK cells are activated by DCs and macrophages that received Dectin-1 signaling to exert their anti-tumor cytotoxicity is a very interesting issue, but hope that the reviewer will agree that this out of the main scope of our present study."

However, two experiments were carried out to examine the potential involvement of soluble mediators in the DC-mediated activation of NK cells. First, we examined supernatants from CD11b<sup>+</sup> or CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells mixed with B16 cells and found that they essentially had no effect on NK cell activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Second, antibodies against type I IFNs or IL12, both known as the potent cytokines for NK cell activation, showed no effect on the NK cell-enhancing activity by CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Taken together, these results support the notion that Dectin-1 signaling is crucial for mediating cell-to-cell contact and subsequent NK activation. In addition, we found no difference between WT and Dectin-1<sup>-/-</sup> DCs in the mRNA induction levels for IL15 or IL15Ra (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). As such, we think it is most likely that Dectin-1 signaling is crucial for mediating cell-to-cell contact between DCs/macrophages and tumor cells and that this contact leads to NK activation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that DCs/macrophages are secondarily activated by yet unknown factors from NK cells in the actual co-culture situation. Therefore, in order to make this point clearer, we revised the summary figure (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), describing the possibility of bidirectional activation between DCs/macrophages and NK cells. This point is also mentioned in the legend of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>."

First, N-glycan structures on tumor cells are likely to be diverse (see <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 4\u20136</a>) and a suitable tool antibody is essentially not available. Second, Dectin-1 <i>per se</i> is also an N-glycosylated protein. As such, although interesting, we hope that the reviewers agree that we cannot perform this experiment."

Perhaps expectedly, <i>Dectin-1</i> mRNA expression was also observed in these cells, and these new data is now presented in <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 3C</a>. Therefore, it is likely that Dectin-1 signaling in DCs and macrophages contributes to control of tumor progression in various tissues including lung and liver, as the reviewer pointed out.

We think it is possible that once NK cells are activated by DCs/macrophages via Dectin-1 signaling, these NK cells will exert more potent tumoricidal activities on other tumor cells that do not express Dectin-1 ligands. Since it has been shown that tumor cells are phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous even in a given tumor mass (Meacham CE and Morrison SJ, <i>Nature</i>, 501, 328\u2013337, 2013), it is possible that tumor cells show different expression profiles with each other for Dectin-1 ligands <i>in vivo</i>. If so, an interesting possibility is that those tumor cells, expressing Dectin-1 ligands, effectively induce DC/macrophage-mediated NK cell activation and that these so-called \u201clicensed\u201d NK cells may exert tumoricidal activities on tumor cells regardless on their Dectin-1 ligand expression. We thank the reviewers for pointing this out and we now discuss this possibility in the Discussion."
