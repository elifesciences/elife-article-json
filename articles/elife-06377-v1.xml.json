In this study, we describe an exception to this paradigm. TRIM33 is identified here as a lineage dependency in B cell neoplasms and is shown to perform this essential function by associating with a single <i>cis</i> element. ChIP-seq analysis of TRIM33 in murine B cell leukemia revealed a preferential association with two lineage-specific enhancers that harbor an exceptional density of motifs recognized by the PU.1 TF. TRIM33 is recruited to these elements by PU.1, yet acts to antagonize PU.1 function. One of the PU.1/TRIM33 co-occupied enhancers is upstream of the pro-apoptotic gene <i>Bim</i>, and deleting this enhancer renders TRIM33 dispensable for leukemia cell survival. These findings reveal an essential role for TRIM33 in preventing apoptosis in B lymphoblastic leukemia by interfering with enhancer-mediated <i>Bim</i> activation."

In this study, we describe an exception to this paradigm. TRIM33 is identified here as a lineage dependency in B cell neoplasms and is shown to perform this essential function by associating with a single <i>cis</i> element. ChIP-seq analysis of TRIM33 in murine B cell leukemia revealed a preferential association with two lineage-specific enhancers that harbor an exceptional density of motifs recognized by the PU.1 TF. TRIM33 is recruited to these elements by PU.1, yet acts to antagonize PU.1 function. One of the PU.1/TRIM33 co-occupied enhancers is upstream of the pro-apoptotic gene <i>Bim</i>, and deleting this enhancer renders TRIM33 dispensable for leukemia cell survival. These findings reveal an essential role for TRIM33 in preventing apoptosis in B lymphoblastic leukemia by interfering with enhancer-mediated <i>Bim</i> activation."

While chromatin restricts the accessibility of these sequences, TFs nonetheless occupy thousands of genomic sites in any given cell type (<a href=\"#bib37\">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</a>). As examples, MyoD has been detected at \u223c39,000 sites in primary myotubes and Pax5 at \u223c20,000 sites in B cell progenitors (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Revilla et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, transcriptional cofactors (coactivators and corepressors) are also known to occupy the mammalian genome in a generalized manner (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ram et al., 2011</a>). Thus, strong support exists for a model in mammalian cells in which transcriptional control is performed by regulators that exert broad, yet highly coordinated effects on gene expression (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wunderlich and Mirny, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</a>). This is in stark contrast to prokaryotic species, in which TFs can occupy as few as one or two sites in an entire genome to implement precise transcriptional responses (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mart\u00ednez-Antonio and Collado-Vides, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wunderlich and Mirny, 2009</a>).

TRIM33 and its homologs TRIM24 and TRIM28 belong to a subfamily of ubiquitously expressed TRIM proteins that contain a tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain module and function as transcriptional cofactors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Venturini et al., 1999</a>). One role of TRIM33 is in the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway, which occurs through regulation of SMAD4 mono-ubiquitination and/or by functioning as a cofactor for the TFs SMAD2 and SMAD3 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dupont et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">He et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agricola et al., 2011</a>). TRIM33 is also known to interact with the TF SCL/TAL1 to promote transcription elongation of erythroid-specific genes, which may occur through the recruitment of FACT and P-TEFb complexes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bai et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2013</a>). However, another study suggests that TRIM33 can form repressive complexes with SCL to block transcriptional activation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kusy et al., 2011</a>). The PHD-bromodomain module of TRIM33 interacts with covalently modified histone tails, which can further stabilize TRIM33 chromatin occupancy and stimulate its E3 ligase activity (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tsai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agricola et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Xi et al., 2011</a>). While several studies have linked TRIM33 to transcriptional control, a genomewide assessment of TRIM33 occupancy has yet to be performed to define the scope of its regulatory function."

The majority of these factors had been identified in a prior screen that evaluated the requirement of chromatin regulators in MLL-AF9/Nras<sup>G12D</sup> acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zuber et al., 2011b</a>), however TRIM33 was identified here as a unique requirement in B-ALL. The six TRIM33 shRNAs used in the screen exhibited a close correlation between knockdown efficiency and loss of B-ALL viability, suggesting on-target effects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Furthermore, a v-Abl transformed B cell progenitor line, 38B9 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alt et al., 1984</a>), and several human B cell cancer lines were also sensitive to TRIM33 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, TRIM33 knockdown led to negligible effects on the viability of MLL-AF9/Nras<sup>G12D</sup> AML and Notch-mutant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Upon knockdown of TRIM33, B-ALL cells underwent apoptosis, as shown by Annexin V/DAPI staining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Taken together, these observations suggest that TRIM33 is essential for the survival of neoplastic B cells."

                                "text": "To compare the TRIM33 requirement in B-ALL with its role in normal tissues, we derived transgenic mice in which a TRIM33 shRNA was expressed from a doxycycline (dox)-regulated promoter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Premsrirut et al., 2011</a>). When crossed with mice that express rtTA-M2 from the ROSA26 promoter, animals exhibited dox-dependent suppression of TRIM33 in multiple tissues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Flow cytometry analysis of the bone marrow and spleen following 1 or 4 weeks of dox administration revealed a selective loss of CD19<sup>+</sup> and B220<sup>+</sup> B lymphoid cells in TRIM33-deficient animals, while erythroid, myeloid, and T lymphoid populations remained intact or even increased in relative abundance (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1I,J</a>). Taking advantage of the reversibility of the dox-regulated shRNA system, we found that B cell production recovered fully in TRIM33-deficient mice upon restoring TRIM33 expression (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Notably, TRIM33 knockdown led to negligible effects on the histological appearance of colon, liver, thymus, and pancreatic tissues and led to no significant changes in animal weight (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Collectively, these findings suggest that B lymphoid cells are uniquely sensitive to TRIM33 inhibition, thus implicating TRIM33 as a lineage dependency in cancers of B cell origin. These results are in agreement with the prior characterization of <i>Trim33</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, which were found to exhibit a B lymphocyte deficiency and an expansion of myeloid cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aucagne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kusy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bai et al., 2013</a>)."

To this end, we performed RNA-seq analysis in B-ALL cells following 3 or 4 days of TRIM33 knockdown. This analysis revealed a distribution of gene expression changes, however, we noted that <i>Bim</i> and <i>Atp1b3</i> were the two most upregulated genes upon TRIM33 depletion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To evaluate whether any of these mRNA changes were due to direct regulation, we performed ChIP-seq analysis in B-ALL cells to evaluate the genomic localization of TRIM33 and various histone modifications that annotate active promoter and enhancer regions. Remarkably, the two strongest sites of TRIM33 enrichment in B-ALL were located 117 kb upstream of <i>Bim</i> (in an intron of a non-expressed gene <i>Acoxl</i>) and at a site 35 kb upstream of <i>Atp1b</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>). The other gene expression changes incurred upon TRIM33 knockdown did not correlate with its genomic occupancy (data not shown), suggesting they might be an indirect effect of B-ALL cells initiating an apoptotic response. The TRIM33-occupied regions upstream of <i>Bim</i> and <i>Atp1b3</i> were enriched for H3K27 acetylation but not for H3K4 tri-methylation, suggesting that these elements are active enhancers (<a href=\"#bib30\">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). We also observed TRIM33 occupancy at these same two regions in 38B9, AML, and in whole spleen, but not in T-ALL (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). A striking attribute of the genomewide pattern of TRIM33 occupancy was its strong bias for a small number of locations, with lower levels of enrichment at other sites across the genome (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 3, 4</a>). This analysis suggests that TRIM33 is concentrated at a small number of sites in the B-ALL genome, with two of these regions correlating with a repressive effect on the expression of nearby <i>Atp1b3</i> and <i>Bim</i> genes."

In contrast, we observed a much lower density of motifs for other TFs involved in B cell specific transcriptional regulation (E2A, EBF1, or PAX5) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Since TRIM33 has been shown previously to interact with PU.1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kusy et al., 2011</a>), we investigated whether PU.1 promotes TRIM33 recruitment to these regions. ChIP-seq analysis of PU.1 in B-ALL confirmed its association with <i>Bim</i> \u2013117 and <i>Atp1b3</i> \u201335, as well as with more than 2600 other genomic sites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We found that PU.1 knockdown led to a significant loss of TRIM33 occupancy at <i>Bim</i> and <i>Atp1b3</i> in proportion to the loss of PU.1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). PU.1-deficient B-ALL cells also harbored reduced H3K27ac at <i>Bim</i> \u2013117 and reduced <i>Bim</i> mRNA levels, suggesting that PU.1 is responsible for maintaining this enhancer in an active state while, paradoxically, also facilitating TRIM33 recruitment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Interestingly, knockdown of TRIM33 led to an increase in PU.1 occupancy and H3K27 acetylation at <i>Bim</i> \u2013117, suggesting that TRIM33 antagonizes PU.1 binding to DNA and suppresses enhancer activity, consistent with prior findings (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kusy et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013I</a>). This result is significant, since <i>Bim</i> \u2013117 is already heavily enriched for PU.1 in B-ALL cells, but PU.1 occupancy becomes even greater when TRIM33 is suppressed. Consistent with the functional importance of PU.1 antagonism by TRIM33, we found that knockdown of PU.1 resulted in a reduced sensitivity of B-ALL and 38B9 cells to the lethal effects of TRIM33 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

Therefore, we considered whether repression of <i>Bim</i> is the essential role of TRIM33 in B-ALL. For this purpose we suppressed <i>Bim</i> using shRNAs and evaluated how this influenced the sensitivity of cells to TRIM33 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Notably, <i>Bim</i>-deficient B-ALL cells were completely resistant to the apoptotic effects of TRIM33 shRNAs, indicating that <i>Bim</i> is the critical downstream repression target of TRIM33 to maintain cell viability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In contrast, <i>Atp1b3</i> knockdown did not alter the sensitivity of B-ALL to TRIM33 suppression (data not shown). To further evaluate whether the essential function of TRIM33 is due to its occupancy at the \u2212117 region, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 to delete this element (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Mali et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Similar to the effects observed upon <i>Bim</i> knockdown, three independent B-ALL clones harboring a homozygous deletion of the \u2212117 element did not require TRIM33 for viability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). <i>Bim</i> knockdown and the deletion of the <i>Bim</i> \u2013117 region also rendered 38B9 cells resistant to the lethal effects of TRIM33 suppression (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Importantly, the level of H3K27ac at this AML-specific enhancer cluster is much greater than that observed at the \u2212117 region. This leads us to speculate that the AML-specific enhancers at the \u221266 kb region might be the dominant regulatory elements at the <i>Bim</i> locus in this cell type. The overall strength of these enhancers in AML may diminish the functional significance of the \u2212117 element, thereby rendering TRIM33 dispensable for AML survival."

                        "text": "Here we provide evidence that TRIM33 prevents apoptosis in murine B-ALL cells by blocking enhancer-mediated <i>Bim</i> activation. The role of TRIM33 as a negative regulator of enhancer activity is reminiscent of LSD1, a histone demethylase that has been shown previously to suppress active enhancers during embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Whyte et al., 2012</a>). However, a key distinction we make here is that LSD1 suppresses thousands of enhancers in ES cells, while TRIM33 preferentially accumulates at a small number of regulatory elements in the B-ALL genome. We trace this unusual enhancer selectivity of TRIM33 in B-ALL to the density of PU.1, a TF which has been shown previously to associate with TRIM33 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kusy et al., 2011</a>). This binding interaction is likely to be cooperative on motif-rich DNA elements, which would account for the biased accumulation of TRIM33 at enhancers harboring an exceptional PU.1 density. Our ChIP-seq analysis of TRIM33 in myeloid, B lymphoid, and T lymphoid leukemias suggests that other TFs are also likely to recruit TRIM33, such as TCF3/E2A (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). To our knowledge, TRIM33 is the first example of a mammalian transcriptional regulator that performs an essential function through a single genomic binding site."

This is in contrast to the effects of suppressing BRD4, a more general cofactor that is essential for the maintenance of many cancer types and for the homeostasis of several normal tissues (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bolden et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Shi and Vakoc, 2014</a>). Remarkably, it is the localization of TRIM33 to one lineage-specific enhancer upstream of <i>Bim</i> that renders B-ALL cells hypersensitive to loss of TRIM33. The similar sensitivity of normal and transformed B cells to TRIM33 inhibition implies that the regulatory mechanisms defined here in B cell leukemia are likely to have evolved to control normal B cell development. Interestingly, <i>Bim</i> is upregulated as a means to eliminate auto-reactive B cells and to prevent autoimmune disease, suggesting a rationale for precise modulation of enhancer activity at the <i>Bim</i> locus by TRIM33 to regulate adaptive immunity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bouillet et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Enders et al., 2003</a>)."

Hence, our findings also implicate TRIM33 as a promising therapeutic target, since one of the major phenotypic abnormalities in mice experiencing systemic TRIM33 inhibition is a selective and reversible B lymphocyte deficiency. Targeting of TRIM33 is particularly attractive since other bromodomain modules (e.g., BRD4) have proven to be amenable to direct chemical inhibition (<a href=\"#bib29\">Prinjha et al., 2012</a>). However, we observe a modest expansion of myeloid cells upon short durations of TRIM33 suppression in vivo and <i>Trim33</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice have been shown to develop chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aucagne et al., 2011</a>). Thus, long-term inhibition of TRIM33 might have pro-tumorigenic effects in certain tissues. Nonetheless, our findings justify consideration of TRIM33-inhibition as a therapeutic approach in B cell neoplasms, which would be expected to unleash an apoptosis-promoting enhancer element."

Many B-lineage cancers and autoimmune diseases continue to be urgent clinical problems, increasing the impact of this manuscript. The authors define a novel mechanism, where highly clustered binding sites for the transcription factor PU.1 at enhancer sites are counteracted by Trim33. This disproportionally affects 2 genes including the apoptosis inducer <i>Bim</i>. The authors demonstrate functional importance of <i>Bim</i> and functional importance of a single enhancer element upstream of <i>Bim</i>. Thus, virtually all of the oncogenic effects of TRIM33 can be attributed to binding to a single site in the genome, a remarkable discovery."

However, while they show the initial phenotype for several B cell lines, B-ALL, 38B9 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B, 1C</a>) and other B cell cancer lines (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplements 1B, 1C, 1D</a>), all mechanistic work (except for TRIM33 occupancy) is done in only one cell line (B-ALL). The authors should reproduce their mechanistic studies in a second cell line (e.g., 38B9). Otherwise the novelty of this work is somewhat limited: it is known that PU.1 binds enhancers, and that TRIM33 interacts with PU.1. The reviewers agreed on the need to delineate the PU.1/TRIM33/<i>BIM</i> pathway in 38B9 cells, with the exception of removal of the enhancer at the <i>BIM</i> locus, which was thought to be too involved and would delay publication."
