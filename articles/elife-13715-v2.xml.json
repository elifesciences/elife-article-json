Fruit fly studies have helped identify some molecules that play a role in helping partner cells find one another and connect. These studies have also shown that the timing of brain cell development appears to play a role. But the role that layer formation plays in the process is still a mystery."

The number represents the ratio of NFI for each R8 cell in a row against the background staining in each disc. To minimize the effect of variations in the staining of individual discs following modifications were made to imaging and analysis protocol- The discs were imaged as a single slice so that complete nuclei of all R8 cells are captured simultaneously to avoid fluorescence decay between slices. The fluorescence of each R8 nucleus was normalised against the background signal of exactly the same area. Further, to get rid of variation between samples, ratio of average R8 fluorescence against average fluorescence of background of each disc was considered while quantifying the NFI of Sequoia expression for each row."

Interestingly, most of these molecules function in the second phase of axon targeting and the molecular mechanisms governing the initial innervation of R8 and R7 axons as well as the importance of this temporary positioning for subsequent synaptic layer targeting remain elusive. The Zn finger transcription factor Sequoia and the cell adhesion molecule N-Cadherin are both expressed in R7 as well as R8 cells but are primarily required for the temporary layer positioning of R7 axons (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lee et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Petrovic and Hummel, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Ting et al., 2005</a>). Additionally, the LRR molecule Capricious, expressed only in R8 cells, has been described to control R8 axon targeting during the second step (<a href=\"#bib76\">Shinza-Kameda et al., 2006</a>) but its role in the initial targeting of R8 axons to temporary medulla position has not been addressed despite an early onset of expression."

By quantifying the number of R8/R7 growth cones at three consecutive stages of early pupal development (6/12/24\u00a0hr After Puparium Formation, APF), we could show that R cell axon innervation in the medulla mirrors the temporal pattern of R cell specification and follows a consistent sequence of growth cone segregation for each stage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E\u2019</a>, summarized in B). At the anterior edge of the medulla the youngest R8 axons arrive sequentially and position at the superficial layer of the medulla neuropile ('R8 positioning', <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> arrowhead), followed by the arrival of the first R7 axon at the respective R8 position about 6\u00a0hr later and three columns posterior to the youngest R8 axon (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2019</a> arrowhead). For the next 6-8\u00a0hr, represented by 3\u20134 columns, R7/R8 growth cones are in close contact followed by their segregation into adjacent positions, with R7 growth cones locating proximal with respect to the superficial R8 growth cones in the corresponding columns ('R7-R8 segregation', <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2019-E\u2019</a>).

Here we observed that the majority of single Seq<sup>high</sup> R7 axons segregate from the surrounding wild type Seq<sup>low</sup> axons and project deeper into the medulla (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D'</a>). In contrast to the single cell clones, most of the mosaics with two adjacent Seq<sup>high</sup> R7 cells show growth cone convergence and termination at the appropriate medulla position (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u201d</a>). Interestingly, single Seq<sup>high</sup> R7 cells from distant columns, which overshoot the temporary layer, often converge in the inner medulla neuropile (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D'</a> arrow) or even within the lobula complex (data not shown). Similar to R7, mosaics of R8 cells with different Sequoia expression levels segregate during initial axon positioning: single Seq<sup>high</sup> R8 axons segregate from the surrounding wild type Seq<sup>low</sup> R8 axons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E'</a> arrowhead) and extend further into the medulla neuropile (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E'</a> arrow), whereas two or more neighbouring Seq<sup>high</sup> R8 growth cones converge and terminate at the R7 position (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\"</a> arrow).

Strikingly, clones of Seq<sup>high</sup> R1-6 cells segregate their growth cones from the wild type (Seq<sup>low</sup>) ones thereby organizing the formation of a novel layer within the lamina neuropile (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I\u2013J\u201d</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F,F\u2019</a>). This demonstrates that large differences in Sequoia levels among R cells, either inherently present as in case of developing R7/R8 cells or ectopically generated as in case of R1-R6 cells, segregate their growth cones into distinct layers. In all cases, cells with higher Sequoia levels position their growth cones deeper in the neuropile. From these data we propose a 'Growth Cone Segregation' model, in which small differences in Sequoia levels lead to an evenly\u2013spaced growth cone positioning within a layer, whereas large Sequoia differences result in segregation of growth cones into separate layers. In contrast, equal levels of Sequoia in projecting R cells, either in loss- or gain-of-function context, cause the convergence of growth cones and termination of axonal extension (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>)."

To temporally restrict the Gal4-driven expression of Sequoia, we utilized the Gal80<sup>ts</sup> (TARGET system, <a href=\"#bib49\">McGuire, 2003</a>). At the permissive temperature (18\u00b0C) functional Gal80 prevents Sequoia expression whereas an inactive Gal80 at the restrictive temperature (29\u00b0C) allows the induction of Sequoia expression. Using this method, an R8 growth cone shift to deeper medulla position can be observed following Sequoia expression until 24\u00a0hr APF (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In contrast, an onset of Sequoia expression after 24\u00a0hr APF, at which time all photoreceptor axons have arrived in the target field, has no effect on R7/ R8 growth cone segregation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This indicates that R7/R8 cells are sensitive to Sequoia-induced growth cone segregation only during a narrow developmental window. Interestingly, although R8 growth cones do not change the layer upon Sequoia expression after 24\u00a0hr APF, they still respond to these elevated Sequoia levels by leaving their topographic position and converging onto neighbouring growth cones (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This indicates that the restriction of R cell growth cones to distinct temporary layers occurs immediately following their segregation whereas the process of columnar restriction continues into the later steps of visual map formation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ferguson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Ting et al., 2007</a>)."

Upon the induction of Sequoia expression at 6\u00a0hr APF with about 18 R8 growth cones in the medulla target region, we observed a defined shift of the youngest 10 of these R8 growth cones to the deeper R7 position whereas the more posterior, and therefore older, 8 R8 growth cones remain at their superficial medulla position. This indicates that posterior R8 growth cones had consolidated their position prior to the effects of induced Sequoia expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Two hours later (at 8\u00a0hr APF), four more R8 growth cones (12 out of 20) are no longer responsive to elevated Sequoia levels as they do not leave their superficial medulla positions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Upon the onset of Sequoia expression at 12\u00a0hr APF, 16 out of 24 R8 growth cones are retained in the superficial medulla position (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Additionally, continuous Sequoia expression at later developmental stages does not disrupt the superficial layer positioning of R8 growth cones that are consolidated prior to Sequoia induction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Together, the consolidation of each R8 growth cone occurs approximately 18\u2009hr after its arrival at the superficial medulla layer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). The fixed correlation between the number of consolidated R8 growth cones and developmental time indicates that for each R8 growth cone there is a defined transition from the initial positioning to the consolidation shortly after R7-R8 segregation."

Capricious (Caps) is expressed in projecting R8 cells and has been proposed to mediate R8 axon targeting (<a href=\"#bib76\">Shinza-Kameda et al., 2006</a>). We determined the relative levels of Capricious expression in the developing medulla at the R8 and R7 positions by measuring the ratio of normalized fluorescence intensities (NFI) of Capricious staining at the R8 and R7 growth cones against the surrounding medulla region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> Table). At the anterior medulla, Capricious shows a homogeneous expression with NFI ratios for R cell growth cones and corresponding medulla region being close to 1 (0.94 in R8 and 0.87 in R7 growth cone position, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>). Following the phase of growth cone segregation, Capricious enriches during the process of consolidation at the region of R8 growth cones with an NFI ratio increasing to 1.39 and a four fold decline at the R7 position (with the ratio of 0.24, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2019\u2013D\u2019</a>).

The partial reduction of Capricious levels via targeted RNAi does not interfere with the consolidation of R8 growth cones in the superficial medulla position (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). As described above, approximately 16 R8 growth cones in the posterior medulla region are consolidated in their initial position at 12\u00a0hr APF, making them insensitive to the induction of Sequoia expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>). In contrast, the RNAi-mediated Capricious reduction in the background of elevated Sequoia expression severely affected the R8 growth cone consolidation resulting in most of the posterior R8 growth cones shifting to the deeper R7 position (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K,L</a>). Furthermore, co-expression of Sequoia and Capricious prevents Sequoia-induced shift of R8 growth cones and leads to segregation of R7 and R8 growth cones in a wild type pattern (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B\u2019</a>). Therefore, Sequoia mediated growth cone segregation and Capricious mediated adhesion are antagonistic forces that are capable of balancing each other to achieve proper positioning of R-cell growth cones in the developing medulla."

To determine how the initial growth cone positioning influences subsequent steps of synaptic layer selection we followed the development of R8 growth cones which have been displaced to deeper R7 position. Wild type R8 growth cones are positioned at the superficial medulla at 24\u00a0hr APF (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,A\u2019</a>) and later target to layer M3 in the adult (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,B\u2019</a>). A pulse of Sequoia expression until 24\u00a0hr APF and subsequent repression using Gal80<sup>ts</sup> leads to an initial shift of all R8 growth cones to the deeper R7 position (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,C\u2019</a>). Interestingly, in the subsequent steps of synaptic layer targeting, these R8 axons, together with R7 axons, terminate in the layer M6 even without further Sequoia expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,D\u2019</a>). Additionally, an early Sequoia pulse until 6\u00a0hr APF leads to a shift of 8\u201310 posterior R8 growth cones towards the deeper R7 medulla position (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,E\u2019</a>). Following this pattern during the subsequent steps of medulla development reveals that R8 axons recognize their final target layer exactly according to their initial growth cone position (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,F\u2019</a>), with 10 most posterior R8 axons targeting to the layer M6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>\u2019 arrowhead) and the remaining R8 axons terminating in the layer M3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F\u2019</a> arrow). We analysed if this R8 mis-targeting to layer M6 results from Sequoia-induced changes in the expression of Capricious and the known R8 guidance receptor Frazzled (<a href=\"#bib61\">Pecot et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Shinza-Kameda et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Timofeev et al., 2012</a>). However, no difference in Capricious and Frazzled expression can be detected in R8 cells with elevated Sequoia levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G-J'</a>), which is in line with earlier data showing that Sequoia does not influence cell-type specific differentiation programs of R7 and R8 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Petrovic and Hummel, 2008</a>)."

In wild type (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K\u2013K\u201d</a>), the expression of pre-synaptic syb::spGFP1-10 in R7/R8 (<i>LGMR-Gal4</i>) and post-synaptic <i>LexAop-spGFP11::CD4</i>, in Dm8 cells (<i>OrtC1-3 LexA DBD, OrtC2B dVP16AD;</i> <a href=\"#bib36\">Karuppudurai et al., 2014</a>; See Materials and methods for details), results in GRASP-positive R7-&gt;Dm8 connections in layer M6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K\u201d</a> arrows) and no GRASP-positive R8-&gt;Dm8 connections can be detected in layer M3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K\u201d</a> arrowheads). When R7 growth cones are retained at the R8 temporary layer via <i>UAS-Capricious<sup>ID</sup></i> expression using <i>sev-Gal4</i> (<a href=\"#bib76\">Shinza-Kameda et al., 2006</a>), GRASP signal, demonstrating R7-&gt;Dm8 contacts, can be observed only in columns where 'escaper' R7 axons target to layer M6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L\u201d</a> arrows), but not in columns with mis-targeted R7 axons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L\u201d</a> arrowhead). Surprisingly, GRASP-positive R8-&gt;Dm8, similar to R7-&gt;Dm8, connections can be detected in medulla layer M6 following the early shift of R8 growth cones to the deeper medulla position (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6M\u2013M\u201d</a>), indicating that both R7 and R8 can recognize Dm8 processes and form synaptic contacts."

The growth cones of the same R cell type topographically segregate within the temporary layer. This segregation within a layer is mediated by low inter-ommatidial differences in the Sequoia levels (illustrated for R8 cells). The segregation of growth cones of different cell type (R7/R8) between distinct temporary layers occurs as a result high intra-ommatidial differences in Sequoia levels. The differences in Sequoia levels are an outcome of temporal sequence of photoreceptor specification in the eye disc (<a href=\"#bib91\">Tomlinson and Ready, 1987</a>). Therefore, birth-order dependent differential positioning generates this early patterning of afferent growth cones in the medulla. (<b>B</b>) Once the initial patterning is achieved, the cell adhesion molecules consolidate the growth cones in their distinct temporary layers. In case of R8 growth cones, Capricious mediates afferent-target interactions and thereby stabilizes R8 growth cones in the superficial medulla position. The R7 growth cones, segregated into deeper medulla position most likely interact with neurites of Dm8 cells, the primary post-synaptic target of R7 cells via N-Cadherin (<a href=\"#bib59\">\u00d6zel et al., 2015</a>). This sequential process continues until all R cell axons arrive in the developing medulla field, are segregated into and consolidated in distinct temporary layers. (<b>C</b>) Following the Capricious mediated consolidation of R8 growth cones in the superficial medulla and possible R7-&gt;Dm8 interaction in the deeper medulla position, axons of both cell types synchronously extend towards their final target layers. The guidance of R8 axons to M3 layer is mediated by localised NetB signal from L3 neurites (<a href=\"#bib85\">Timofeev et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Pecot et al., 2014</a>). On the contrary, the R7 axons are suggested to passively dislocate and reach layer M6 via their interactions with Dm8 neurites that are gradually pushed deeper in the medulla as a result of growth of the medulla field (<a href=\"#bib59\">\u00d6zel et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, the extension of R7 axons to reach layer M6, following their initial positioning, requires N-cadherin function (<a href=\"#bib59\">\u00d6zel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Ting et al., 2005</a>). Therefore, M6 targeting of R7 axons seems to be a result of pre- and post-synaptic neuron interactions mediated by general synaptogenetic molecules rather than cell type specific factors. Thus, cellular proximity determines M6 layer targeting and establishment of synaptic contacts."

Further, induced Capricious expression in R8 and R7 cells, in Capricious null background (therefore resulting in a target region without any Capricious expression) is sufficient to mis-target R7 axons to layer M3, again indicating a direct R7-R8 afferent interaction (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berger-M\u00fcller et al., 2013</a>).

By creating Seq<sup>high</sup>-Seq<sup>low</sup> R cell combinations using Sequoia gain-of-function R7 mosaics we observed that difference in Sequoia levels among neighbouring cells could induce growth cone segregation. The endogenous differences in Sequoia levels most likely arise as a result of the temporal sequence of R cell specification, suggesting a self-patterning mechanism in early visual circuit assembly (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hassan and Hiesinger, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Roignant and Treisman, 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib91\">Tomlinson and Ready, 1987</a>).

This suggests a so far unknown molecular mechanism in which the growth state of an axon is directly coupled to differential growth cone adhesion. As we could demonstrate a cell-autonomous function of Sequoia in R8 for columnar segregation as well as in R7 for layer segregation, we envision a mechanistic model related to the concept of cell competition, in which strong cell-cell interactions induce cell-autonomous responses (<a href=\"#bib69\">Rhiner et al., 2010</a>)."

It maintains R8 axons in the position where they are responsive to subsequent NetrinB signal provided by L3 neurites (<a href=\"#bib61\">Pecot et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Timofeev et al., 2012</a>). This is supported by two different sets of results: First, as we show in this study, the displacement of R8 growth cones to deeper medulla position leads to their mis-targeting to layer M6 in spite of normal Frazzled expression in these R8 cells. Second, the ectopic expression of Frazzled in R7 cells cannot re-direct them to M3 layer in response to localized NetrinB signal present in the superficial position but R8 axons can be re-directed to a different layer (M1/M2) by ectopic expression of localized NetrinB in a position deeper to the superficial R8 medulla position (<a href=\"#bib56\">Nern et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Pecot et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Timofeev et al., 2012</a>). Taken together, these observations suggest that M3 layer targeting via L3-mediated NetrinB signalling requires R8 axons to be positioned superficially in the medulla further underscoring the importance of R8 growth cone consolidation in this position (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

The loss of these molecules specifically affects the stabilization of R7 growth cones during the second step of targeting. Additionally, these molecules along with N-Cadherin have been shown to be critical for establishment of synaptic contacts between pre and post-synaptic neurons (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arikkath and Reichardt, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Astigarraga et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Garrity et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hummel and Zipursky, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lee and Godenschwege, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Nagaoka et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Prakash et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Reines et al., 2012</a>). We confirm previous observations, that R7 growth cones are in close proximity with their primary post-synaptic target neurons, Dm8, at the end of growth cone segregation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B'</a>, <a href=\"#bib88\">Ting et al., 2014</a>). This raises the possibility that targeting of R7 axons to M6 layer, later in the development, could be the direct result of R7-&gt;Dm8 contacts mediated by N-Cadherin. Recently it was shown that N-Cadherin function is necessary for stabilizing R7 growth cones in the deeper medulla position but not for targeting and subsequent extension of R7 axons to M6 layer seems to be a result of passive dislocation (<a href=\"#bib59\">\u00d6zel et al., 2015</a>). Additional support for the role of N-Cadherin in the formation and maintenance of R7-&gt;Dm8 contacts, following their initial segregation from R8 growth cones, comes from our observation that early expression of Sequoia in <i>CadN</i> mutant R7 cells under weak <i>elav-Gal4</i> driver can rescue the mis-targeting of R7 growth cones in the superficial medulla position along with R8 growth cones at 24\u00a0hr APF (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A,A\u2019,C,C\u2019</a>), but fails to rescue the later mis-targeting to layer M3 eventually resulting in a mis-targeting phenotype identical to <i>CadN</i> mutant R7 axons (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B,B\u2019,D,D\u2019</a>). Interestingly, the R8 growth cones initially mis-positioned in the deeper medulla eventually mis-target to layer M6 and form synaptic contacts with Dm8. In addition, these R8 cells, with axons mis-targeted to layer M6, do not show changes in any of their known cell-type specific molecules including early specifier of cell identity (Senseless), guidance receptors (Frazzled, Capricious) and sensory receptors (Rh6). In addition, no expression of R7 specific molecules (Prospero, R3, Rh4) can be detected. Thus, the R8 cells interact with Dm8 neurons most likely via ubiquitously expressed molecules such as N-Cadherin expressed in both, R7 as well as R8, cells. This is supported by our observation that N-Cadherin is required for stabilization of R8 axons at the layer M6 (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2E\u2013F</a>\u2019)."

This raises the fundamental question of how synaptic layer selection influences synaptic partner recognition. The cellular complexity of potential post-synaptic target layer encountered by ingrowing R cell axons has not been fully determined, leaving room for selective recognition for synaptogenesis within a layer. In fact, it has been shown that within M6, R7 axons form synapses with Dm8 but not with Tm5c (<a href=\"#bib36\">Karuppudurai et al., 2014</a>) which also arborize the M6 layer. In addition, we have identified various medulla columnar neurons within M6 that are not contacted by R7 axons (unpublished results).

Experiments presented here support a developmental scenario in which the medulla context for arriving R cell axons reduces the complexity of synaptic partner selection. For example R8 and L3 have different arrival times at M3 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Nern et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Pecot et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">2014</a>), thereby would encounter a different local environment of potential post-synaptic partners competent for synaptogenesis. It is plausible that some form of temporal co-ordination of afferent axons and their post-synaptic partner cell neurites would actually simplify the synaptic partner matching. The concept of temporal identity would argue that R7 and R8 axons arriving at the same medulla position approximately the same time, as shown in the Sequoia gain-of-function background, will pick the same synaptic partners exemplified by Dm8.

However, this default R8 program is suppressed to facilitate R7 specification (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cook et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Morey et al., 2008</a>). Thus, a temporally separated, novel R7 cell is generated with basic neuronal differentiation similar to that of an R8 cell (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brennan and Moses, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Friedrich et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Roignant and Treisman, 2009</a>).

It is most clearly demonstrated in a series of experiments published in two papers, Timofeev et al. (2012) and Pecot et al. (2014). Here the L3 growth cone in the M3 layer is essential for the targeting of R8. This is, at least, in part mediated by Netrin signaling; Netrin is expressed selectively in M3 and its receptor Frazzled is expressed and required in R8. The data presented in this paper does not in any way critically address the issue of whether R7/R8 interactions (whether mediated by seq or not; of course only indirectly as Seq is a transcription factor) play a role in promoting their segregation into different layers. This is one possible explanation of an interesting set of data but by no means the only one. At a minimum, demonstrating a role for growth cone/growth cone interaction requires generating one mutant growth cone with no defect itself leading to changes in the behavior of a neighboring wild type growth cone. This alone, however, does not provide strong support for a direct interaction; the medulla neuropile even at this early stage of development contains the processes of many different neuronal cell types. Thus, the interactions leading to appropriate segregation may be very indirect. The experiments presented in the paper are well done and interesting. But the interpretations are simply not straightforward given the complexity of the experimental design on one hand and the inherent complexity of the tissue. In short, the notion that R7/R8 interactions play an important role in their segregation is fascinating but the authors provide no compelling data in support of this idea."

With the connectome in hand from the Janelia group there are many examples that this is simply not the case. For instance, R8 and L3 terminate in M3 but only L3 makes synaptic connections with Tm9. Each layer contains the processes of many different neurons and yet R7 and R8 within their respective layers only make synaptic connections with a discrete subset of them. There is simply no correlation between the area of contact and the probability of synaptic connectivity. The authors provide one example by showing that R8s misexpressing Seq, within a particular time frame during development, will mistarget to M6 and here, using a clever variation on GRASP they demonstrate synapses between R8 and Dm8, the normal target for R7. Based on this observation, and solely on this observation, they conclude that synaptic specificity is determined by the layer in which a terminal finds itself rather than through selective recognition between processes of different neurons within the same layer. The assumption here, of course, is that expression of Seq has no effect on R8 terminals other than re-positioning it to M6; that is the authors assume that an otherwise normal R8, that is mispositioned, is forming synapses with a target appropriate for this layer. It is simply not plausible that over expression of a transcription factor that is leading to a change in the position of the growth cone is also not changing its molecular nature. So while the results with sequoia mis-expression are consistent with the notion that layers are determinative for specificity, the data are merely a correlation and one resting on the assumption that mis-expression of Seq during a specific time period has not activated the expression of proteins in these mutant R8 cells for competence to form synapses with Dm8."

Later in the manuscript, the authors propose that R7 axons get stuck in M1 in flies that are both seq mutant and <i>gogo</i> overexpressing is their attachment to R8s. However, <i>gogo</i> is overexpressed with the GMR promoter in these experiments. This means <i>gogo</i> may affect R7s independently from R8s, resulting in their failure to extend to the M3 later. The authors further state that (Discussion, second paragraph) seq mutant R7 axons extend to M3 later because of their association with R8 axons (also reference need for statement that R7 cells are Frazzled-negative). However, <i>CadN</i> mutant R7 axons that have previously retracted are capable of re-extension in the medulla seemingly independent of what R8s are doing and clearly at the wrong time (days later!) (Ozel et al. 2015), which at least raises the possibility that R7s are capable of directing themselves to M3 if they fail to stabilize in M6. A simple experiment here would be to overexpress <i>gogo</i> specifically in seq mutant R8s and observe the behavior of seq mutant R7 cells."

The wording 'temporal layer' does not apply to R7, since it remains stabilized throughout development and doesn't move anywhere. The authors should come up with a different term for the 'temporary' state of R7 and R8 in this system. One interpretation of the data is that R7 axons as well as Seq overexpressing R8 axons target directly to the future M6 layer, which significantly simplifies the developmental problem at hand. The apparent movement or 'elongation' happens only because the entire M6 layer is pushed further down by the newly innervating lamina and medulla cells forming the other layers. The authors should replace that with \"R7 target layer\", \"the future M6\" or even simply M6."

If Seq levels are decreased or increased equally in all cells involved, there should be no defects as the \"relative\" levels do not change. To support the hypothesis of 'relative level comparison' one might present an experiment where Seq expression level changes in a subset of cells cause a defect but the same amount of change in all cells does not.

Although there is no experimental demonstration of direct R7-R8 afferent interactions, the following set of data indicate that such interactions occur during development. 1) It is well established that R7 axons tightly fasciculate and follow R8 pioneer axons from the eye disc into the target region (Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1993). 2) Further support for direct interaction between R7-R8 afferents comes from Maurel-Zaffran et al., 2001, where the expression of LAR as a membrane tethered ligand in R8 cells alone (using an R8-specific <i>Gal4</i> driver line) can induce a response from R7 axons, indicating a direct signalling between R8-R7 axons. 3) In addition, induced Capricious expression in R8 and R7 cells, in a Capricious null background (therefore resulting in a target region without any Caps expression) is sufficient to mis-target R7 axons to layer M3, again indicating a direct R7-R8 afferent interaction (Berger-M\u00fcller et al., 2013). In addition, in the manuscript we show that the final target layer of sequoia mutant R7 axons depends on the targeting of R8 axons, suggesting that mis-targeting of sequoia mutant R7 axons to ectopic synaptic layer is the consequence of segregation defects rather than a change in target layer recognition."
