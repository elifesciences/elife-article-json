Several molecules implicated in cell interactions also control collective migration, but their precise role and the finely tuned expression that orchestrates this complex developmental process are poorly understood. Here, we show that the timely and threshold expression of the Netrin receptor Frazzled triggers the initiation of glia migration in the developing <i>Drosophila</i> wing. Frazzled expression is induced by the transcription factor Glide/Gcm in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the glial determinant also regulates the efficiency of collective migration. NetrinB but not NetrinA serves as a chemoattractant and Unc5 contributes as a repellant Netrin receptor for glia migration. Our model includes strict spatial localization of a ligand, a cell autonomously acting receptor and a fate determinant that act coordinately to direct glia toward their final destination."

Several molecules implicated in cell interactions also control collective migration, but their precise role and the finely tuned expression that orchestrates this complex developmental process are poorly understood. Here, we show that the timely and threshold expression of the Netrin receptor Frazzled triggers the initiation of glia migration in the developing <i>Drosophila</i> wing. Frazzled expression is induced by the transcription factor Glide/Gcm in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the glial determinant also regulates the efficiency of collective migration. NetrinB but not NetrinA serves as a chemoattractant and Unc5 contributes as a repellant Netrin receptor for glia migration. Our model includes strict spatial localization of a ligand, a cell autonomously acting receptor and a fate determinant that act coordinately to direct glia toward their final destination."

                        "text": "Neurons and glia show mutual reliance in many functional and developmental aspects of biology. Glia migrate collectively and over long distances to establish an intricate relationship with neurons. Defective glia migration is associated with several human diseases including glial brain tumors and defective regeneration following injury in the nervous system (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kl\u00e4mbt, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kocsis and Waxman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Oudega and Xu, 2006</a>). Hence, a thorough understanding of the molecules involved in the process of glia migration may contribute to the development of therapeutics for these pathologies. Research progress in recent years has revealed the involvement of chemotropic cues in glia migration (<a href=\"#bib76\">von Hilchen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Spassky et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kinrade et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). Netrins, a class of secreted laminin-related extracellular proteins, have been described as chemotropic guidance cues for axons and migrating cells during neural development (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Harris et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ishii et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kennedy et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Mitchell et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Serafini et al., 1994</a>). In vertebrates, Netrins secreted by the floor plate cells act differentially on the migrating oligodendrocyte precursor cells and this differential outcome is dependant upon the type of receptors expressed in the migrating cells (<a href=\"#bib72\">Spassky et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wolf and Friedl, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jarjour, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Tsai et al., 2003</a>). Netrins act as chemoattractants through the DCC/Frazzled family of receptors (<a href=\"#bib76\">von Hilchen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chan et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Keino-Masu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kolodziej et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Timofeev et al., 2012</a>) and chemorepellants through the Unc5 receptor family (<a href=\"#bib39\">Keleman and Dickson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Labrador et al., 2005</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, the two Netrins (NetA and NetB\u00a0[<a href=\"#bib28\">Harris et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Mitchell et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Keleman and Dickson, 2001</a>]) and their receptor Frazzled (Fra) mediate the attraction of embryonic longitudinal glia toward the midline\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib76\">von Hilchen et al., 2010</a>). Despite the extensive knowledge on these ligands and receptors, the transcriptional control underlying chemoattraction and the impact of this pathway remain largely unknown. For example, what is the specific role of the receptors and how do they contribute to the different steps of collective migration, such as initiation, maintenance\u00a0and arrest? Related to this issue, which transcription factors regulate the cell-specific and timely expression of the receptors? We here investigate the chemoattraction cascade that\u00a0controls cell migration using the chain of glial cells across the L1 nerve in the developing <i>Drosophila</i> wing (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aigouy et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Berzsenyi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kumar et al., 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "We show that only one of the two <i>Drosophila</i> Netrins, NetB, serves as a chemoattractant for collective glia migration. The role of Fra is to control the time of initiation of glia migration in a dosage-dependent manner, whereas Unc5 acts as the repellant receptor that controls glial arrest. Finally, we identify the transcription factor that controls the expression of Fra at the appropriate time and levels: Glial cell deficient/Glial cell missing (Glide/Gcm or Gcm, for the sake of simplicity), the fate determinant that is expressed early and transiently in the glial lineages (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hosoya et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Vincent et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jones et al., 1995</a>). Thus, we find that an early gene, which regulates the expression of transcription factors that execute a specific cell fate, also regulates effector genes that controls late developmental events. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a fate determinant directly controls collective cell migration, prompting us to revisit the role and mode of action of these types of molecules during development."

Glial cells originating from the sensory organ precursors (SOPs) present on the anterior margin migrate proximally, i.e. toward the central nervous system (CNS) following the axon bundle and ensheathing it throughout its length. L1 glia initiate migration at around 18\u2009hr After Puparium Formation (hAPF), reach the level of the Costal nerve at around 22\u201324 hAPF and join the glial cells on the Radius by 28 hAPF. The migratory process has been accordingly subdivided into three steps: \u2018Initiation\u2019, \u2018Costa reach\u2019 and \u2018Complete migration\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a\u2013c</a>)."

In short, we assessed the percentage of wings displaying complete glia migration at 28 hAPF (migratory index: MI), as an estimation of migration efficiency (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kumar et al., 2015</a>). For each genotype, at least 30 wings were analyzed. We first focused on the most characterized loss-of-function (LOF) allele <i>fra<sup>3</sup></i>\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib44\">Kolodziej et al., 1996</a>). As this mutation is embryonic lethal in homozygous conditions, we analyzed <i>fra<sup>3</sup></i>\u00a0heterozygous wings and found incomplete L1 glia migration in a significant fraction of samples, as shown by the position of the glial nuclei (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a\u2013c</a>). The number of glial cells is not affected\u00a0and\u00a0hence cannot be the cause of the migratory defect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). We reasoned that nuclei may not migrate properly, but that\u00a0glial processes may still reach the final destination. To test this possibility,\u00a0we assessed the migratory index of glial cells labelled by the &gt;GFP transgene, which allowed us to visualize glial processes in flies that were heterozygous for the .. These wings also show incomplete glia migration as shown by the position of glial GFP labeling (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e\u2013g</a>)\u00a0suggesting that glial cells require Fra to complete their migration."

The knock down of <i>fra</i> using the <i>gcm</i>&gt;GFP driver, which is the earliest glial driver, reveals a significant decrease in migration efficiency as compared to that observed in the control wings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, compare blank and light blue columns). To exclude the possibility of off-target effects, we analyzed wings that express the <i>UAS-fra-RNAi</i> together with the <i>UAS-fra</i> transgene, and found complete rescue of the migratory phenotype induced by the <i>fra</i> KD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, patterned light\u00a0and\u00a0dark blue column). This strongly suggests that the RNAi line induces a specific phenotype and that <i>fra</i> acts in a cell autonomous manner. Finally, as a complementary approach, we reintroduced <i>fra</i> expression only in the glial cells of <i>fra<sup>3</sup>/+</i> animals (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>), and found that this rescues the migratory phenotype, albeit partially. Given the high levels of Fra expression in the <i>gcm</i>&gt;<i>fra</i> GOF wings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3g\u2013g\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019</a>), it is unlikely that this partial\u00a0rescue\u00a0is due to suboptimal levels of Fra. Rather, the lack of total rescue may be ascribed to the neuronal requirement of Fra. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e\u2013f\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019</a> shows that Fra is expressed in glia as well as in neurons, and indeed around one third of <i>fra<sup>3</sup>/+</i> wings show an axonal navigation phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b\u2013d</a>). In these wings, axonal navigation is delayed, which may indirectly affect glial migration. To further check the role of Fra neuronal expression in glia migration, we used a driver that\u00a0is\u00a0expressed specifically in the L1 neurons: <i>nsyb-Gal4</i> (<a href=\"#bib78\">West et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Pauli et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Riabinina et al., 2015</a>). <i>nsyb</i>-driven expression starts to be detected around 18 hAPF; but the expression is more prominent at 22 hAPF and onwards (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1f\u2013h\u201d</a>). We then knocked down <i>fra</i> specifically in neurons using <i>nsyb-Gal4</i> and found no delayed glia migration (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1i</a>), except in one third of the wings, which present an axonal navigation defect (not shown). This is in line with the above-mentioned <i>fra<sup>3</sup>/+</i> data and with previous data showing that axon navigation defects indirectly affect glia migration (<a href=\"#bib24\">Giangrande et al., 1993</a>)."

We first checked the MI of <i>fra</i> GOF wings at 28 hAPF and found that the percentage of wings that shows complete migration is higher as compared to that of control wings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, compare white and dark blue columns). Since most control wings show complete migration by 28 hAPF (90%), we also analyzed an earlier stage, when migration has been achieved in only\u00a0a\u00a0few control wings (24 hAPF; 12.5%). We found that many more <i>fra-</i>overexpressing wings show complete migration (68.5%, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>).

The phenotype is further enhanced in glia that express both the <i>gcm&gt;GFP</i> and a <i>gcm RNAi</i> line (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a> patterned brown and\u00a0pink\u00a0column). Since the <i>gcm-Gal4</i> driver is a hypomorphic <i>gcm</i> allele that results\u00a0from the insertion of a <i>Gal4</i>-containing transposon into the <i>gcm</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jacques et al., 2009</a>), the above result raised the possibility that Gcm and Fra interact genetically. To explore this possibility, we analyzed the glia migration phenotype in double heterozygous conditions for <i>fra</i> and two other <i>gcm</i> hypomorphic alleles, including the <i>gcm<sup>rA87</sup></i> enhancer trap carrying a LacZ transposon inserted into the <i>gcm</i> promoter and the imprecise excision line <i>gcm\u00a0</i>(<a href=\"#bib66\">Riabinina et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Vincent et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jacques et al., 2009</a>).

Furthermore, we crossed the <i>fra<sup>3</sup>\u00a0</i>mutation with a <i>gcm</i> driver that does not affect the <i>gcm</i> locus, a transgenic line carrying 6Kb of the <i>gcm</i> promoter fused to the <i>Gal4</i> gene, which is inserted on the third chromosome (<a href=\"#bib20\">Flici et al</a><i><a href=\"#bib20\">., 2014</a></i>).

Finally, we used the <i>UAS-gcm-RNAi</i> line to reduce the amount of Gcm (<i>gcm</i> KD) and also observed a migratory defect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, dark brown column, MI = 25%). The rescue obtained upon co-expressing the <i>UAS-gcm</i> and the <i>UAS-gcm-RNAi</i> transgenes indicates that <i>gcm</i> plays a regulatory role in migration and that the RNAi effects are specific (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, patterned pink-dark\u00a0brown column). Furthermore, overexpressing Gcm using the <i>UAS-gcm</i> transgene (<i>gcm</i> GOF) is sufficient to increase the migration efficiency of glial cells, as the percentage of wings showing complete migration increases compared to that in control animals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>, pink column and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>)."

There are three canonical Gcm-binding sites (GBS) in the <i>fra</i> locus, two of which are located at the position of a strong DAM ID peak, which is indicative of Gcm binding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). To confirm this data, we assessed whether <i>fra</i> expression is activated by Gcm in <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells. To do so, we built a GFP reporter under the control of the <i>fra</i> locus containing two GBSs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a\u2013a\u2019</a>). qRT PCR assays clearly show an increase in the GFP levels upon co-transfection of the reporter vector with the Gcm expression vector and this effect is dose dependent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>, columns with a red color gradient).

This profile of expression fits well with the distal to proximal migration of L1 glia, and we reasoned that if NetB were to act as a chemoattractant, its loss should cause glial migratory defects similar to those induced by the loss of Fra. We therefore knocked down <i>NetB</i> by crossing <i>NP4151-Gal4</i> to <i>UAS-NetB-RNAi</i> (<i>NetB</i> KD) flies and uncovered a severe migration defect, which could be rescued by simultaneously expressing <i>UAS-NetB</i> and <i>UAS-NetB-RNAi</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>, first three columns).

The chemoattractant receptor Fra controls glia migration in response to a long-distance signal, thechemoattractant NetB.

Reducing the amount of Fra delays migration, whereas excessive Fra in the glial cells triggers their precocious migration. Thus, the Fra receptor plays an instructive role in the first step of collective migration, initiation. These data highlight the importance of quantitative regulation: large cohorts of cells are\u00a0likely to\u00a0need strong forces to switch from an immotile to a motile phenotype;\u00a0therefore only the strong expression of the receptor allows migration toward the chemoattractant. Other migratory collectives also depend on quantitative regulation. Typically, epithelial cells migrating in groups exert much stronger forces than an individual cell before and after epithelial-mesenchymal transition (<a href=\"#bib17\">du Roure et al., 2005</a>). The cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin plays an important role in supporting the\u00a0directional and efficient collective migration of\u00a0epithelial cells by mediating adhesion and force generation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Li et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, the collectively migrating border cell cluster cannot exert enough adhesive/pulling force to move between the nurse cells in the absence of E-cadherin (<a href=\"#bib61\">Niewiadomska et al., 1999</a>)."

Similarly, the Lim-homeodomain transcription factor Islet was shown to specify the electrical properties of motor neurons by repressing the expression of the ion channel Shaker during development, suggesting that the regulation of late genes by early transcription factors might also\u00a0be a common phenomenon (<a href=\"#bib80\">Wolfram et al., 2012</a>).

While we still do not know whether the distinction between long- and short-range signaling depends on the complement of surface receptors and the associated transduction pathways, it seems that different strategies are used in specific processes.

Clearly, downregulating or overexpressing NetA has no impact on the migrating glial cells of the wing and NetA cannot rescue the NetB phenotype. While it is possible that NetA may affect other aspects of wing glia biology, our data indicate that NetB alone serves as a chemoattractant ligand to guide L1 glia migration upon signaling to Fra. Studies in other systems will assess whether it\u00a0is only NetB that works as a long-range chemoattractant. If this were the case, it would be interesting to assess whether the different behavior of\u00a0NetA and NetB relies on the\u00a0intrinsic potentials of the two ligands (e.g. the\u00a0affinity with which NetA and NetB bind to their receptors) or on extrinsic cues (e.g. cell-specific cofactors modulating NetA and/or NetB activity)."

While mammalian migrating oligodendrocyte precursor cells express both DCC and Unc5, the precise function of these receptors has not been assessed (<a href=\"#bib74\">Tsai et al., 2003</a>). We found that the two receptors Fra and Unc5 are expressed by the same set of PNS glial cells, with Fra appearing earlier than Unc5. The two receptors seem to have a different impact on wing glia migration and their stoichiometry is an important factor, as reducing Unc5 levels does have an effect on migration when <i>fra</i> is downregulated (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1b</a> last columns). The fact that overexpressing Unc5 and Fra have opposite effects suggests that Unc5 converts the Netrin-mediated signal from attraction to repulsion in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing glia, in agreement with published data on chimeric molecules. For example, when fused to the cytoplasmic domain of Unc5, the extracellular domain of DCC is as effective in mediating the chemorepellant response to Netrin as a wild type Unc5 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hong et al., 1999</a>). Additionally, a study performed on <i>Drosophila</i> showed that fusing the cytoplasmic domain of Fra with the extracellular domain of Unc5 signals chemoattraction (<a href=\"#bib39\">Keleman and Dickson, 2001</a>). This may explain how the same cues such as Netrins can work differently on various aspects of collective migratory behavior."

The fact that the expression of <i>fra</i> stays on till the end of migration suggests that another player, possibly a direct target of Gcm, maintains its expression. Being a major Gcm target, <i>repo</i> represents a potential candidate. Our in vivo and cell transfection data using a Repo expression vector are in line with this hypothesis and suggest that Repo may play a regulatory role in the maintenance of <i>fra</i> at late migratory stages (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>). It is known that Repo expression first depends on Gcm but subsequently becomes independent of it through autoregulation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Flici et al., 2014</a>), indicating a transition from early to late events in gliogenesis (see model in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9b</a>). We propose that the initial Fra expression in wing glia strictly depends on Gcm and triggers the\u00a0initiation of migration (see the graph in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>). Accordingly, the overexpression of Fra using the <i>repo</i> promoter does not induce migratory defects (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9c,d</a>) and <i>repo&gt;fra</i> KD wings show only modest defects in migration initiation (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>).

The migration of embryonic longitudinal glial cells seems to rely on very early expression of Fra, which is detected in the longitudinal glial precursor, but no longer in the longitudinal glial cells\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib76\">von Hilchen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kolodziej et al., 1996</a>). In our work, we do detect Fra expression in the wing glia.\u00a0However, while in the case of the longitudinal glia both Netrins guide the glia toward the midline, the L1 glia seem to require only NetB. Moreover, ectopic expression of Netrin affects the migration of the longitudinal glia, whereas it does not do so in wing glia, hence suggesting that Netrin has a role in migration efficiency rather than on directionality. And finally, we propose that Fra and Unc5 act in different migratory phases of the same glial population, the first phase being under the direct control of the Gcm glial determinant. Overall, this paper displays a model in which the ligand NetB is expressed early during wing development (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), whereas its receptor Fra is expressed right before migration onset and cell autonomously decides the time of migration initiation of the glial chain. Unc5 appears later and contributes to migration termination. The acquisition of the Fra levels that trigger migration is part of the cell-specification program dictated by the Gcm glial determinant, which not only induces the expression of downstream transcription factors but also directly implements a specific developmental program by triggering the expression of effector genes."

Briefly, based on the time-lapse movies, the migratory process was subdivided in three phases: the earliest one describes migration initiation around 18 hAPF; this time point defines the movement of the soma of the first cell at the front of the chain. The intermediate phase identifies the time at which the glial chain reaches the level of the nerve on the costa, which is around 22 hAPF; the latest phase refers to migration completion, upon connection of the chain with the proximal glia located on the radius nerve, at around 28 hAPF, see panels shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a\u2013c</a>. The time points (hAPF) that were used to define these three migratory phases were calculated on the basis of time-lapse movies performed in at least 10 control animals (n\u226510). In order to quantify the migratory defects, the differences in time between the control and mutant wings were compared and the graphs were plotted using the standard Student's <i>t</i> test method."

Their findings show that frazzled is the major Netrin receptor facilitating initiation of glial migration, and that an early glial fate determinant TF Gcm directly activates frazzled expression. Furthermore, Netrin B but not Netrin A, apparently forms a long-range gradient that guides glia in their migration toward the CNS along peripheral nerves., and Unc5 serves as a repulsive receptor for migration of these wing glia. Transcriptional regulation of axon guidance cues and their receptors remains to be studied in detail. Therefore, this manuscript provides evidence extending our understanding of how these cues and receptors are utilized by glia and how they are transcriptionally regulated. In general, this paper appears to be one that could be of interest to the field and appropriate for <i>eLife</i> following revisions that address the concerns raised below."

It is technically challenging to use GAL4 drivers to differentially target pioneer or follower glia. However, have the authors considered using MARCM (Aigouy et al., 2008) to randomly target different glia in the wing and monitor their migratory behavior in either WT or Fra mutant clones?

Along this line, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> shows that <i>UAS\u2010RNAi</i> for both <i>unc5</i> and <i>fra</i> has a weaker phenotype than <i>UAS\u2010fra\u2010RNAi</i> alone. As per the double mutant <i>NetB\u0394/Y; fra<sup>3</sup>/+</i>, this genotype would not inform on the role of Unc5, because in a hemizygous <i>NetB</i>\u0394<i>/Y</i> animal both Fra and Unc5 should be absent anyway, therefore removing the <i>fra</i> receptor would not make any difference. We thought that this experiment may nevertheless be informative and tell whether <i>fra</i> is also submitted to other signals, as suggested by recent studies (Neuhaus-Follini et al; 2015). We hence performed the suggested experiment and it does seem that <i>fra</i> also depends on other signals, see data on the right graph. We would not include this data in the main text, however, as they go beyond the scope of the manuscript, which is to show the impact of a fate determinant on late aspects of cell specification. As requested, we show the data on the ectopic expression of NetB using <i>en\u2010Gal4</i> in the posterior wing compartment and using <i>GMR 29F05-Gal4</i> that is expressed in the distal part of the wing. These experiments show that ectopic NetB does not affect glia migration (Now <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Thus, NetB does not act as a guidance molecule triggering directionality. This is also discussed in the manuscript on page 23."
