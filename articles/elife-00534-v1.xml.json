We show kataegis can result from AID/APOBEC-catalysed cytidine deamination in the vicinity of DNA breaks, likely through action on single-stranded DNA exposed during resection. Cancer-like kataegis can be recapitulated by expression of AID/APOBEC family deaminases in yeast where it largely depends on uracil excision, which generates an abasic site for strand breakage. Localized kataegis can also be nucleated by an I-SceI-induced break. Genome-wide patterns of APOBEC3-catalyzed deamination in yeast reveal APOBEC3B and 3A as the deaminases whose mutational signatures are most similar to those of breast cancer kataegic mutations. Together with expression and functional assays, the results implicate APOBEC3B/A in breast cancer hypermutation and give insight into the mechanism of kataegis."

We show kataegis can result from AID/APOBEC-catalysed cytidine deamination in the vicinity of DNA breaks, likely through action on single-stranded DNA exposed during resection. Cancer-like kataegis can be recapitulated by expression of AID/APOBEC family deaminases in yeast where it largely depends on uracil excision, which generates an abasic site for strand breakage. Localized kataegis can also be nucleated by an I-SceI-induced break. Genome-wide patterns of APOBEC3-catalyzed deamination in yeast reveal APOBEC3B and 3A as the deaminases whose mutational signatures are most similar to those of breast cancer kataegic mutations. Together with expression and functional assays, the results implicate APOBEC3B/A in breast cancer hypermutation and give insight into the mechanism of kataegis."

Although the mechanism underlying kataegis is unknown, the fact that the mutations occurred nearly exclusively at C residues preceded by a 5\u2032-T suggested that AID/APOBEC cytidine-DNA deaminases might possibly be involved in the process since these enzymes are sensitive to the 5\u2032-flanking sequence context (<a href=\"#bib8\">Conticello et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</a>)."

AID acts on C residues in the DNA of the genomic immunoglobulin loci in activated lymphocytes to trigger antibody gene diversification whereas APOBEC3 family members, of which there are seven in humans, act on C residues in the DNA of viral replication intermediates (usually in the cytoplasm) as part of a host restriction pathway. Off-target deamination by AID results in nucleotide substitutions and genomic rearrangements in B lymphocyte tumours, some of which are implicated in oncogenesis (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib9\">Gazumyan et al., 2012</a>). Although AID is the only member of the AID/APOBEC family known to act physiologically on endogenous nuclear DNA, it is possible that other members of the AID/APOBEC family might occasionally get access to the nucleus and cause cancer-associated genomic damage or mutation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Harris et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Beale et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Vartanian et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Stenglein et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Landry et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Nowarski et al., 2012</a>)."

While the median overall intermutational distance (IMD) is 13 kb, it is apparent that rather than the mutations being scattered randomly over the genome, mutation distribution is bimodal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Dividing the mutations into two groups using k-means cluster analysis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hartigan and Wong, 1979</a>) reveals that one group exhibit a median IMD of 156 kb with a distribution of distances that is as expected for a set of individual mutations randomly scattered over the yeast genome as judged by Monte Carlo simulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We designate these as singlet mutations: they account for 52% of the total mutations. The remaining 48% of the mutations are much more closely spaced than would be expected on a random basis. We designate these as proximal mutations, which are separated from each other by a median IMD of only 727 bp with &gt;99% of them being within 8.5 kb of their closest neighbour."

Thus, if we define proximal mutations as a pair of mutations that are located &lt;8.5 kb apart (a distance that excludes 99% of the singlet mutations) and define a cluster as a stretch of DNA containing \u22655 proximal mutations, we find that 75% of the AID*-induced proximal mutations are actually parts of clusters. These clusters typically extend over 6\u201315 kb (with the full range detected being 1.8\u201330 kb) and contain anything up to 26 mutations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This clustering is far in excess of anything that would be expected on a random basis. The level of mutation clustering observed with AID* is such that more than one-third of the transformants analysed (16/40) contain at least one mutation cluster. In affected clones, a quarter to two-thirds of all the mutations in the cell are concentrated in a small number of clusters that account for &lt;0.2% of the entire genome. Similar clusters were also observed in yeast cells transformed with APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B as well as with the hyperactive APOBEC3G mutant APOBEC3G* (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,F</a>). Like the cancer kataegis, the clustered mutations in the various yeast transformants showed a strong tendency towards strand polarity; mutations within a cluster occur predominantly at either a C residue or a G residue with over 88% of mutations being strand coordinated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,F</a>)."

The transversions exhibit a strong (4- to 10-fold) bias for C\u2192G rather than C\u2192A substitutions (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) suggesting that the replication over the abasic site could be catalysed by REV1 since this translesion polymerase (by virtue of its deoxycytidyl nucleotide transferase activity) inserts C opposite abasic sites (<a href=\"#bib21\">Nelson et al., 1996</a>). Indeed, deficiency in either REV1 or UNG led to a dramatic fall in the proportion of transversion mutations (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Deficiency in UNG also resulted in a fourfold increase in the average total mutation load in AID* transformants (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). This presumably reflects diminished repair of the AID/APOBEC-generated uracils. There was an overall decrease in average total mutation load in AID* transformants of REV1 deficient yeast that might reflect the possible non-catalytic roles of REV1 during DNA damage repair (<a href=\"#bib27\">Sale et al., 2012</a>)."

We found that the increased mutation load in AID* <i>ung1</i>\u0394 transformants was accompanied by a dramatic shift away from mutational clustering (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Despite the fourfold \u2018increase\u2019 in mutation load, the percentage of mutations that are &lt;8.5 kb from their neighbour (proximal mutations) actually \u2018falls\u2019 from accounting for 48% of the AID* mutations in wild type cells to 18% in <i>ung1</i>\u0394 transformants. Similarly, using the same criterion to distinguish clustered mutations in both datasets (\u22655 linked mutations separated from their neighbour by &lt;8.5 kb), 274 of the 1064 mutations observed in AID* wild type transformants are found within clusters compared to 28 of the 2088 mutations in the AID* <i>ung1</i>\u0394 transformants (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>).

Cleavage at abasic sites by apyrimidinic endonucleases will lead to occasional double-stranded DNA breaks: kataegis could result from AID/APOBEC deamination of single-stranded DNA exposed during the resection phase of break repair. To determine whether the DNA break repair process predispose to kataegis, we introduced a target site for the restriction endonuclease I-SceI immediately downstream of the polyadenylation site of the <i>CAN1</i> locus, and asked whether co-expression of I-SceI together with the APOBEC3G* deaminase increased the likelihood of kataegis in the vicinity. We chose to use APOBEC3G* for this experiment since it gave a good mutation load but a lower proportion of kataegic mutations than AID* (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>): any enhancement of kataegis would therefore be more readily detectable. Consistent with previous findings (<a href=\"#bib25\">Poltoratsky et al., 2010</a>), induction of I-SceI expression resulted in an increased frequency of deaminase-dependent selectable mutation at the linked <i>CAN1</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). More importantly, in the presence of APOBEC3G*, induction of a double-strand break increases the probability that mutations in its vicinity are kataegic (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

After 4 hr growth, galactose was added to 2% and cells were cultured for a further 2 days before serial dilution and plating as above. APOBEC3G* was used in the I-SceI experiments as it gave a good mutation load but a lower proportion of kataegic mutations than AID* (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). Induction of protein expression both with and without the raffinose step gave similar mutation rates."

An IMD which excluded 99% of the distal group was then used as a threshold for cluster calling. For all the yeast analysis, the IMD threshold was set using the combined dataset of mutations from the wild type transformants. For the breast cancer analysis, IMDs combined from all tumours were used for threshold setting (except PD4120 because of its much higher mutation load). A cluster was called when a minimum of 5 adjacent mutations were identified each with IMDs below the threshold. This 5 mutation threshold was chosen since such clusters are likely to arise with a probability of &lt;0.001 by randomly scattered mutations."

The tetracycline transactivator (TET-ON; Clontech) was cloned into a modified pMSCVpuro (Clontech) which contained an IRES-mCherry cassette at the BglII\u2013ClaI site, to generate pTET-ON-ImC. A derivative of the KBM7 human myelocytic leukemia line that stably expressed TET-ON protein was established by retroviral infection with virus particles produced from 293 cells that had been co-transformed with pTET-ON-ImC and packaging vectors using GeneJuice (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) according to manufacturers instructions. This KBM7[pTET-ON-ImC] cell-line was then superinfected with pMSCV/APOBEC retrovirus to yield derivatives expressing the AID/APOBEC proteins under doxycyclin-inducible control. Expression of the FLAG-tagged AID/APOBEC proteins in the KBM7 transfectants was monitored by Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates after 24 hr of doxycyclin induction using HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody M2 (A8592; Sigma, Gillingham, UK), probing with anti-lamin antibody (ab16048; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) as a loading control."

Also, wouldn't the induction of both the human deaminases and I-SceI be better if, instead of using glucose medium at all, cells were grown in the non-inducing/non-repressing mediums of either raffinose or 3% glycerol 3% lactate, followed by the addition of galactose</i>?"
