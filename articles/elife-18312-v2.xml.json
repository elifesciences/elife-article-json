                    "text": "While more than 70 genes have been linked to deafness, most of which are expressed in mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear, a challenge has been to link these genes into molecular pathways. One example is <i>Myo7a</i> (myosin VIIA), in which deafness mutations affect the development and function of the mechanically sensitive stereocilia of hair cells. We describe here a procedure for the isolation of low-abundance protein complexes from stereocilia membrane fractions. Using this procedure, combined with identification and quantitation of proteins with mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that MYO7A forms a complex with PDZD7, a paralog of USH1C and DFNB31. MYO7A and PDZD7 interact in tissue-culture cells, and co-localize to the ankle-link region of stereocilia in wild-type but not <i>Myo7a</i> mutant mice. Our data thus describe a new paradigm for the interrogation of low-abundance protein complexes in hair cell stereocilia and establish an unanticipated link between MYO7A and PDZD7."

                    "text": "While more than 70 genes have been linked to deafness, most of which are expressed in mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear, a challenge has been to link these genes into molecular pathways. One example is <i>Myo7a</i> (myosin VIIA), in which deafness mutations affect the development and function of the mechanically sensitive stereocilia of hair cells. We describe here a procedure for the isolation of low-abundance protein complexes from stereocilia membrane fractions. Using this procedure, combined with identification and quantitation of proteins with mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that MYO7A forms a complex with PDZD7, a paralog of USH1C and DFNB31. MYO7A and PDZD7 interact in tissue-culture cells, and co-localize to the ankle-link region of stereocilia in wild-type but not <i>Myo7a</i> mutant mice. Our data thus describe a new paradigm for the interrogation of low-abundance protein complexes in hair cell stereocilia and establish an unanticipated link between MYO7A and PDZD7."

Using this method, it was possible to isolate MYO7A along with other proteins it associates with. One of these proteins \u2013 called PDZD7 \u2013 is known to be part of ankle links. The next step following on from this work is to use this new method to study other important groups of proteins that are even more scarce in hair bundles."

The mechanically sensitive organelle responsible for mechanotransduction is the hair bundle, a cluster of ~100 actin-filled stereocilia that protrude apically from a hair cell (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gillespie and M\u00fcller, 2009</a>). Because stereocilia bend at their bases yet are coupled together with elastic linkages, the bundle pivots as a whole when exposed to mechanical stimuli. One special type of linkage, the tip link, couples bundle pivoting to electrical excitation of the hair cell. The tip link is composed of a dimer of CDH23 (cadherin 23) molecules interacting with a dimer of PCDH15 (protocadherin 15) molecules (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kazmierczak et al., 2007</a>), and is coupled to the mechanically sensitive transduction channel. Another class of linkage, the ankle link, couples stereocilia together at their bases, transiently in auditory hair cells but persistently in vestibular hair cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Goodyear and Richardson, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adato et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">McGee et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Michalski et al., 2007</a>). Because many genes encoding proteins known to be associated with these links are affected by mutations that cause deafness, it is of great interest how these links couple with proteins within the stereocilia."

We initially used this approach to determine which proteins interact with MYO7A in the inner ear, using the monoclonal antibody 138-1 to show that MYO7A interacts tightly with several scaffolding proteins, notably PDZD7. By immunoprecipitating expressed proteins in tissue-culture cells, we confirmed that the interaction of PDZD7 and MYO7A is direct. Moreover, MYO7A is also in a protein complex including ADGRV1, which likely also includes PDZD7. We also show that USH1C, USH1G, and CDH23 co-precipitate from chick stereocilia with MYO7A, confirming the presence in the\u00a0tissue of a complex that had only been suggested by genetics and recombinant-protein expression. Because other scaffolding proteins co-precipitate with MYO7A, these experiments show not only that MYO7A contributes to the tip-link and ankle-link complexes, but also suggest that MYO7A participates in other stereocilia protein complexes. Finally, the experiments indicate that the coupled stereocilia-membrane purification and immunoaffinity isolation methods will be useful for isolating even very rare protein complexes from stereocilia."

As in our previous experiments coupling stereocilia isolation with mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#bib67\">Shin et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">2013</a>), we used E19-E21 chicks because of chicks\u2019 availability, moderate cost, sequenced genome, and near-mature inner ear. In most cases, we treated the exposed surfaces of dissected inner ears with DTSSP, a membrane-impermeable, reversible crosslinker with two N-hydroxysuccinimide groups coupled with an 12\u2009\u00c5 spacer that includes a disulfide bond (<a href=\"#bib71\">Staros, 1982</a>, <a href=\"#bib72\">1988</a>); this treatment stabilizes complexes of membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Corgiat et al., 2014</a>), presumably including ankle links and tip links. DTSSP treatment should not affect intracellular protein complexes, however, and is reversed by reduction. If their binding affinity is sufficiently high, cytoplasmic proteins in association with membrane proteins should still be detected, however, even without covalent crosslinking. Because one investigator can comfortably dissect only ~200 ears per day, to allow larger preparations (\u22651000 ears), we froze tissues daily after quenching the DTSSP reaction."

For this analysis, ATP2B2 was split out of the group also containing ATP2B1 and ATP2B4 group; data corresponding both ATP2B2 and PTPRQ were emphasized to illustrate the effectiveness of the stereocilia-membrane enrichment. The number of proteins detected in each fraction was also indicated. (<b>B</b>) Gene ontology analysis with DAVID of the S7 (RIPA-soluble) fraction using S1 (PNS) as background. The top ten cellular component terms enriched are indicated; the log of the P-value (adjusted for false-discovery rate, FDR) is plotted. The inset shows a magnification of the 'plasma membrane' term, which had a substantial increase in significance in the S7 fraction. (<b>C</b>) Relationship between enrichment slope and frequency of Ensembl-annotated transmembrane helicies. Each protein identified was assigned 1 if they were annotated as having a transmembrane helix, and 0 if not. All proteins were sorted according to enrichment slope, and an average was calculated every 50 proteins. (<b>D</b>) Stereocilia membrane protein enrichment. Displayed are bundle-enriched (&gt;three-fold) proteins from <a href=\"#bib77\">Wilmarth et al. (2014)</a> that were annotated as containing transmembrane domains, plus SLC34A2, SLC9A9, and SLC9A6. ND, not detected. (<b>E</b>) Clustering analysis of shotgun mass-spectrometry data using mclust. After data were log-transformed, they were normalized within a row, subtracting the row mean and dividing by the row standard deviation (thus the resulting mean was 0 and the\u00a0standard deviation was 1). The best solution returned 25 clusters, which were ordered here by the\u00a0enrichment slope (only the five fractions used in A were used to calculate the slope). PTPRQ, ATP2B2, and XIRP2 were all in the cluster with the steepest enrichment slope. (<b>F</b>\u2013<b>I</b>) Targeted proteomics analysis of enrichment fractions. (<b>F</b>) Chromatograms of SAPLHILTDEDAPSSPPESLSVK peptide from PTPRQ detected in S1 (dark gray) and S7 (orange) fractions; inset shows magnified S1 chromatogram. Sum of 12 daughter ions. Arrows indicate where multiple MS2 spectra matched to PTPRQ were acquired. (<b>G</b>) Example MS2 spectrum from S7 sample; multiple peaks matched to predicted PTPRQ peptide fragment ions. (<b>H</b>) Targeted proteomics analysis of enrichment fractions. The mean of the total intensity area of 4\u20138 peptides per protein is indicated. (<b>I</b>) Same data as <b>G</b>, except area relative to S1 is indicated."

The MYO3A-MYO3B group, with a somewhat steeper slope, was only detected in three fractions. SLC34A2 was highly enriched, as was XIRP2; while the function of the latter protein is poorly understood, it does localize to the membrane-cytoskeleton interface in stereocilia and could bind membranes itself (<a href=\"#bib25\">Francis et al., 2015</a>). Many other proteins enriched in the D10 preparation have annotated transmembrane domains, although some of these proteins likely derive from membranes other than those of stereocilia. Other proteins were known stereocilia proteins (ESPN, ANKRD24, MYO1H). Although ATP2B2 is part of a protein group also containing ATP2B1 and ATP2B4, which are not located in stereocilia (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dumont et al., 2001</a>), we estimated ATP2B2\u2019s contribution to the ATP2B1/2/4 group riBAQ value for each fraction; we divided the intensities from peptides only found in each isoform by the sum of all isoform-specific peptides, generating the fractional contribution for each isoform.

For the subsequent step, we used the 138-1 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes chicken MYO7A (<a href=\"#bib70\">Soni et al., 2005</a>). We applied the S7 RIPA extract to control beads, constructed with purified mouse IgG, then applied the unbound material to 138-1 beads. Each aliquot of beads was washed thoroughly, then eluted with SDS; eluted proteins were then analyzed by shotgun and targeted mass spectrometry. Passing the extracts over control beads allowed us to identify proteins that nonspecifically bound to the immunoaffinity reagents, many of which were abundant; these proteins were then computationally subtracted from the proteins identified in the 138-1 eluates. We carried out three independent immunoprecipitation experiments, each with ~500 ear-equivalents; one to three technical replicates from each eluate were subjected to shotgun mass spectrometry, and the results from the six shotgun runs were analyzed together. All data are deposited at ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD004221, and the analysis is tabulated in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>."

To provide stronger evidence that MYO7A forms a protein complex with PDZD7 and ADGRV1, we used targeted proteomics to determine how much of each protein was precipitated by 138-1 anti-MYO7A or control immunoaffinity beads. PDZD7 was present at significantly greater levels in 138-1 precipitations than in control precipitations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>), confirming its specific precipitation with MYO7A. By contrast, only one peptide for ADGRV1 showed significant enrichment in 138-1 immunoprecipitates compared to controls, and the fraction precipitated was very small (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). We suggest that PDZD7:MYO7A complexes are more abundant than ones containing ADGRV1, or that ADGRV1 binds less tightly than PDZD7."

We have focused here on PDZD7, which is essential for the\u00a0formation of the ankle-link protein complex (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ebermann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Grati et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Zou et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2014</a>) and requires MYO7A for localization to ankle links.

Originally identified as a modifier gene for Usher syndrome type 2 genes, <i>PDZD7</i> has more recently been identified as a nonsyndromic deafness gene itself (<a href=\"#bib10\">Booth et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Vona et al., 2016</a>). Genetics experiments showed that positioning of ADGRV1 at ankle links depends critically on PDZD7 (<a href=\"#bib86\">Zou et al., 2014</a>); consistent with those results, PDZD7 binds directly to ADGRV1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2014</a>). Our experiments suggest how this positioning might occur; PDZD7 could bind to MYO7A, and then MYO7A could transport the PDZD7-ADGRV1 complex to its final location. While present at lower levels than PDZD7, we did detect ADGRV1 in co-immunoprecipitates with MYO7A by both shotgun and targeted mass spectrometry; our experiments do not reveal, however, whether all three are simultaneously in the same protein complex."

MYO7A is also required for localization of ADGRV1; while MYO7A might bind directly to ADGRV1, the necessity of PDZD7 for the\u00a0formation of the ankle-link complex suggests that MYO7A localizes both PDZD7 and ADGRV1 at ankle links. Association of MYO7A with ankle-link proteins explains the early observation that MYO7A concentrates at the ankle-link region of vestibular stereocilia of mature frogs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hasson et al., 1997</a>) and cochlea stereocilia of immature mice (<a href=\"#bib65\">Senften et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">L\u00ebfevre et al., 2008</a>). Positioning at this location by MYO7A is surprising, however, as the ankle links are very close to the pointed ends of the filaments located at the periphery of the stereocilia actin core. We suggest three possible explanations. First, because MYO7A moves from pointed to barbed ends of actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib46\">Inoue and Ikebe, 2003</a>), MYO7A may move PDZD7 and ADGRV1 towards stereocilia tips but stall if the N-terminal, extracellular end of ADGRV1 was anchored on the adjacent stereocilium. In this case, MYO7A would put ankle links under tension, which could also explain the frequent oblique positioning of the links (<a href=\"#bib32\">Goodyear and Richardson, 1992</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">1999</a>). Second, MYO7A could hand off PDZD7 to MYO6 anywhere in the stereocilium; because MYO6 moves towards pointed ends of actin filaments, it would properly localize the ankle-link proteins at stereocilia bases. Indeed, MYO6 is thought to move PTPRQ to the taper region (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sakaguchi et al., 2008</a>). Finally, MYO7A and MYO6 may be in a multimolecular, bidirectional motor complex; like with other bidirectional motor complexes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hancock, 2014</a>), reciprocal regulation of the two motors could steer the complex to the top or bottom of the stereocilia. Indeed, MYO6 was the most abundant protein co-precipitated with MYO7A, and we are presently investigating the specificity of this interaction. Regardless of the mechanism, the data here show that MYO7A binds PDZD7 and is necessary for at least one step in its localization at the base of the hair bundle."

Although each of these will require in-depth characterization such as we have done here for PDZD7, we can speculate to their possible roles in hair cells. MYL1 and MYL4 are myosin light chains, and may substitute for CALM in binding to one or more IQ domains in MYO7A (or MYO6). The presence of MYO6 is quite interesting, as it could mediate pointed-end-directed motility in a complex that also contains a barbed-end-direct motor. More specific investigation of how MYO6 and MYO7A interact will be required; our preliminary co-expression experiments indicated only a low-stoichiometry interaction when both were expressed together in HEK cells (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). A relatively large fraction of ANKRD24 present in the stereocilia-membrane extract was co-precipitated, yet ANKRD24 did not appear to bind directly to MYO7A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a>,<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). Presumably ANKRD24 interacts with MYO7A via other proteins, indicating that a larger MYO7A complex may be present that warrants further study. Other proteins were highly enriched but less abundant, including MYO3B, MYO1H, ESPN, LMO7, FSCN2, and GRXCR1. All of these proteins interact with the actin cytoskeleton, and it is likely that some of them co-precipitate because of their association with substoichiometric levels of actin filaments also bound to MYO7A. Future experiments will be needed to discern which of these proteins interacts specifically with MYO7A complexes and which co-precipitate on associated actin."

This MYO7A-USH1C-USH1G complex was not necessarily the tip-link complex itself, as MYO7A could simply transport the scaffolding proteins to the correct location at stereocilia tips, hand off the complex to CDH23, then dissociate. Notably, CDH23 does not depend on MYO7A for localization in hair bundles (<a href=\"#bib65\">Senften et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bo\u00ebda et al., 2002</a>), although USH1C does (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bo\u00ebda et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">L\u00ebfevre et al., 2008</a>), suggesting that the cadherin and scaffolding proteins are transported separately.

Nevertheless, consistent localization at ankle links and tip links suggests that MYO7A may also anchor protein complexes and sense tension applied to them. Furthermore, examination of <i>Myo7a<sup>8J/8J</sup></i> hair bundles indicates clearly that both their actin organization and stereocilia adhesion are disrupted.

We can identify co-precipitating proteins using enrichment analysis, but despite a nearly 10,000-fold purification of MYO7A, the immunoaffinity eluates have many proteins that have bound nonspecifically. This result is entirely expected; the proteins that interact with MYO7A are rare within stereocilia, so MYO7A protein complexes are present at extremely small levels in the stereocilia detergent extract. In addition, because of their low levels, extensive washing of MYO7A immunoprecipitates is required, biasing our analysis towards high-affinity interactions. Future studies that use a second antibody purification step following precipitation with 138-1, for example with an anti-PDZD7 antibody, will be needed to generate a more pure complex that can be interrogated for additional binding partners and stoichiometries of each component. Such experiments will likely require further scaling up of the starting material, given the likely losses during purification. Nevertheless, there is great value in large-scale purification of protein complexes from stereocilia, as these experiments will allow us to identify interacting components\u2014like those in the transduction-channel complex\u2014that may not be detected by any other strategies."

However, the stochastic sampling that plagues shotgun mass spectrometry experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>) suggested that reliable detection of low abundance proteins would require multiple mass spectrometry runs, each a technical replicate. For the purification analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), technical replicates are aliquots of the purification fractions; for the immunoaffinity purification experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), technical replicates are divided 138-1 eluates. For practical reasons, for each experiment, we carried out two to three preparations (biological replicates) of ~500 chicken ears each. In the targeted proteomics experiments, not all proteins (and their peptides) were analyzed in each experiment (biological replicate). We ensured that each peptide analyzed in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> was examined in at least two technical replicates from each of two biological replicates, for a total of four mass spectrometry runs each."

Solvent A was water and solvent B was acetonitrile, each containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid.

Chromatographic and spectral data from RAW files were loaded into Skyline and manually analyzed to determine fragment ion peaks corresponding to each peptide. RAW files were also processed using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) software in order to match MS/MS spectra to an Ensembl spectral database using Sequest HT. Fragment ion peaks for each peptide were chosen according to the following criteria: 1) three or more co-eluting fragment ions contributed to the peak signal, 2) at least two or more data points were collected across the peak, and 3) one or more spectra within the peak were matched to correct peptide sequence within the spectral database. If spectra within a specific sample were not identified then a) the retention time of the chosen peak must be within 2 min of the retention time of an identified peak for that peptide from another sample and b) the type of daughter ions contributing to the peak must match the identified peptide peak from another sample. If no peak matching these criteria was found in a particular sample the peak area was counted as zero. Chromatographic peak areas from all detected fragment ions for each peptide were integrated and summed to give a final peptide peak area. Because heavy peptide standards were not used in all targeted experiments, the intensities for each sample were normalized by the relative MYO7A 138-1 eluate intensities for each experiment (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Briefly, for each MYO7A peptide, the intensity for a given experiment was divided by the average of all experiments for that peptide. These peptide normalization factors were then averaged across all MYO7A peptides, yielding an experiment normalization factor. The area for each peptide analyzed was then divided by the appropriate experiment normalization factor. The normalized peak areas were then averaged for the 4\u20136 replicates, and divided by the average of all S7 starting material (total) experiments. This calculation yielded the IP/total value, which was displayed for each peptide in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. We then used the Student's t-test to determine whether the results from the 138-1 experiments were different from the control experiments.

Until now, this has revealed the total proteome but not discrete molecular complexes. Here, they use a purification protocol to cross-link proteins, pull down membranes with an antibody to an abundant membrane protein, and then specifically isolate proteins associated with MYO7A using a secondary immunoprecipitation. The paper illustrates the power of the method, but also how very difficult it is to do biochemistry at this scale. Even if few will have the courage to follow this path, the paper is an important contribution both to the technology and to the specific molecular understanding of stereocilia. As submitted, the paper is very complete with only few areas for polishing."

The premise is that a high throughput screen of 1000s of stereociliar bundles may yield sufficient material for mass spectroscopic determination of candidate interacting proteins. The bulk of the manuscript is a presentation of the protocol used to accomplish the identification of PDZD7 as a potential interaction protein. The identification is verified using immunohistochemical labeling in culture cells and hair cells. The manuscript is essentially a methods paper with extraordinary expository power. The writing is spellbinding and held my interest throughout even though I do not totally understand the reason for each branch of the flow diagram describing the experimental design."

Membrane proteins were targeted and stabilized using treatment with DTSSP a reversible crosslinker. Biochemical and proteomic methods were used to isolate, purify, enrich and identify stereocilia proteins and specifically the interacting partners of Myo7A. Overall this work provides good evidence supporting the ability of this new method to isolate stereociliary proteins as well as to investigate protein clustering. There are a couple of issues that could be addressed to make the significance of the work more clear both methodologically and biologically."
