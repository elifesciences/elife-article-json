PhoQ activity is repressed by divalent cations and induced in environments of acidic pH, limited divalent cations, and cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMP). Previously, it was unclear which signals are sensed by salmonellae to promote PhoQ-mediated virulence. We defined conformational changes produced in the PhoQ PD on exposure to acidic pH that indicate structural flexibility is induced in \u03b1-helices 4 and 5, suggesting this region contributes to pH sensing. Therefore, we engineered a disulfide bond between W104C and A128C in the PhoQ PD that restrains conformational flexibility in \u03b1-helices 4 and 5. PhoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup> is responsive to CAMP, but is inhibited for activation by acidic pH and divalent cation limitation. <i>phoQ<sup>W104C-A128C</sup></i> <i>Salmonella enterica</i> Typhimurium are virulent in mice, indicating that acidic pH and divalent cation sensing by PhoQ are dispensable for virulence."
