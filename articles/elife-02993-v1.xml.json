These two precursor populations contribute to different parts of the heart; the first heart field forms the atria and left ventricle, whereas the rest of the heart is derived from the second heart field (<a href=\"#bib3\">Evans et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bruneau, 2013</a>). Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Chulan Kwon of the Johns Hopkins University and co-workers\u2014including Lincoln Shenje and Peter Andersen as joint first authors\u2014report that they have identified a niche containing cardiac precursors that are maintained in a progenitor state by two proteins called Numb and Numblike (<a href=\"#bib8a\">Shenje et al., 2014</a>)."

Parts of the heart that are derived from the second heart field (namely the outflow tract and right ventricle) failed to develop normally. Furthermore, the second pharyngeal arch (PA2 for short)\u2014an embryonic structure that is next to the top of the developing heart\u2014was also smaller. Shenje, Andersen et al. determined that, shortly after the heart starts to develop, cardiac progenitor cells that would normally contribute to the outflow tract, right ventricle and PA2 were missing in these mutant mice. In wild-type mice, on the other hand, cells in the PA2 continued to proliferate as progenitor cells while they remained in this arch, and contributed directly to the heart by migrating into it as it developed. This suggests that the progenitor cells within the PA2 are a self-renewing population of cardiac precursors."

These \u2018explant cultures\u2019 revealed that, when released from their embryonic environment, some PA2 cells migrate out and spontaneously change into cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells that can \u2018beat\u2019). Further, transferring cardiac precursors purified from embryonic stem cells onto a layer of PA2 cells maintained them in a self-renewing state and thus prevented them from changing into specific cell types. However, once removed from the co-culture with the PA2 cells, the cardiac precursor cells were released from their stem cell-like state and continued to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. The fact that the PA2 cells can maintain cardiac precursors, at least in culture, in a self-renewing progenitor state is striking because cardiac precursors taken from embryonic stem cells will never normally pause their differentiation into cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Kattman et al., 2006</a>)."

These two proteins are known to maintain a progenitor state in the precursors of nerve cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Petersen et al., 2002</a>). Shenje, Andersen et al. used chimeric mice generated by taking stem cells from embryos with the <i>Numb/Numblike</i> genes knocked out (and also labeled with a red fluorescent protein), and injecting these cells into wild-type embryos. The combined loss of <i>Numb</i> and <i>Numblike</i> did not affect the migration of cardiac precursors into PA2, but these double knockout cells failed to proliferate when they reached the PA2. Thus, the Numb and Numblike proteins function within individual cells to regulate the multiplication of cardiac precursors with the PA2 niche. These findings provide a redefined view of progenitor allocation in heart development, and highlight the importance of a population of self-renewing cells within a niche."

Harnessing the properties of the PA2 that promote self-renewal of cardiac precursors would allow this."
