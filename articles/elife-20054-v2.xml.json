Marks. Brandeis University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), operating under Animal Welfare Assurance #A3445-01, approved the use of vertebrate animals (rats) in protocol #0910-09 to Suzanne Paradis. The neurons are studied by various techniques, including electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry and microscopy. Invertebrate model systems are not useful here because the proteins we study are not present in their genome. Where possible we use tissue culture cells, however, much of the work focuses on how native ion channels are expressed and regulated. Rodents are the lowest phylogenetic order in which we can carry out the experiments we propose. Rats are also the standard organism for studies of cerebellar granule neuron physiology and are well established in the field as the organism of choice for the studies proposed. Thus, there is an extensive literature against which to compare and interpret the experimental results. Rats are frequently the source of neurons for cultures due to the large size of their brains and the relative robustness of their neurons in culture. The rat is a well-accepted model for studying ischemia in vitro, providing several advantages: a) the vulnerability of the rodent nervous system to hypoxia-ischemia is well-characterized, b) that rat shares identical mechanisms of ischemia-induced neuronal death with humans and c) procedures for minimizing discomfort, distress, pain, and injury as well as for euthanasia are extensively studied and ours follow AVMA guidelines."

Marks. Brandeis University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), operating under Animal Welfare Assurance #A3445-01, approved the use of vertebrate animals (rats) in protocol #0910-09 to Suzanne Paradis. The neurons are studied by various techniques, including electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry and microscopy. Invertebrate model systems are not useful here because the proteins we study are not present in their genome. Where possible we use tissue culture cells, however, much of the work focuses on how native ion channels are expressed and regulated. Rodents are the lowest phylogenetic order in which we can carry out the experiments we propose. Rats are also the standard organism for studies of cerebellar granule neuron physiology and are well established in the field as the organism of choice for the studies proposed. Thus, there is an extensive literature against which to compare and interpret the experimental results. Rats are frequently the source of neurons for cultures due to the large size of their brains and the relative robustness of their neurons in culture. The rat is a well-accepted model for studying ischemia in vitro, providing several advantages: a) the vulnerability of the rodent nervous system to hypoxia-ischemia is well-characterized, b) that rat shares identical mechanisms of ischemia-induced neuronal death with humans and c) procedures for minimizing discomfort, distress, pain, and injury as well as for euthanasia are extensively studied and ours follow AVMA guidelines."

In humans, decreased cerebral blood flow (ischemia) resulting in acute neuronal hypoxia correlates with pathological changes in electroencephalographic recordings and decreased electrical signaling in less than 150 s (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sundt et al., 1981</a>). At the cellular level, the first effect of hypoxia is to increase <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boening et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Stys et al., 1992</a>); this precedes a series of events that include depolarization of the plasma membrane, excitotoxic elevation of intracellular calcium, mitochondrial dysfunction, ATP depletion, increased production of reactive oxygen species and, ultimately, cell death (<a href=\"#bib22\">Leao, 1944</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hansen, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Choi, 1990</a>). While these downstream effects have been well studied, the early hypoxia-induced change in Na<sup>+</sup> flux has received less attention despite strong evidence to support its critical role in the hypoxic insult: inhibition of <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> by tetrodotoxin (TTX) attenuates hypoxia-induced depolarization and reduces neuronal death in the\u00a0hippocampus, hypothalamus, and neocortex (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boening et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Stys et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Weber and Taylor, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Xie et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Taylor et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fung et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Horn and Waldrop, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Raley-Susman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Banasiak et al., 2004</a>). Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of TTX have been judged to occur both independent of, and by reduction of the excitotoxic effects that follow <i>I</i><sub>Na</sub>-induced membrane depolarization."

The shift was recapitulated by application of SUMO1 under normoxic conditions and suppressed by the deSUMOylating enzyme SENP1. Consistent with tonic control of <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> by the SUMO pathway, SUMO1 and SENP1 increased and decreased the current, respectively, under normoxic conditions. The response of <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> to hypoxia was ablated by \u00b5\u2013Conotoxin-TIIIA (CnTX), a potent blocker of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. Supporting the implied mechanism\u2014rapid SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels at the CGN plasma membrane in response to hypoxia\u2014hypoxia was directly shown to increase the interaction of native SUMO1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 at the neuronal surface using antibody-mediated fluorescent resonance energy transfer (amFRET) microscopy and ground state depletion, stochastic optical reconstruction super-resolution microscopy (STORM). SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 on Lys38 was shown to be necessary and sufficient to explain the changes in <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> induced by hypoxia by reconstitution of the hypoxic response in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells using heterologously expressed subunits. Further, study of live CHO cells in real-time using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy revealed that acute hypoxia leads to monoSUMOylation of single Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels already at the plasma\u00a0membrane without a change in\u00a0the number of channels on the surface."

Moreover, we found that the enzymes that mature, activate, and conjugate SUMO to the channels reside on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane in tissue culture cells and neurons (<a href=\"#bib30\">Plant et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2012</a>). Here, seeking evidence for regulation of <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> by the SUMO pathway, we delivered 100 pm SUMO1 into CGN via the patch-pipette, a concentration that produces maximal effects on the K<sup>+</sup> channels. We observed SUMO-induced changes in <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> like those produced by acute hypoxia: peak <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> increased by\u00a0~76% and <i>V<sub>\u00bd</sub></i> and SSI were left-shifted by \u221213\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 mV and \u221210\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 mV, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c,d</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

                                "text": "The neuronal response to acute hypoxia is often studied in cells cultured at ambient levels of oxygen. However, the baseline O<sub>2</sub> level in mammalian brain tissue has been estimated to be as low as\u00a0~7% under normal, healthy conditions and to drop to under 2% with ischemia (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ponce et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lyons et al., 2016</a>). Therefore, we sought to reevaluate <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> responses at O<sub>2</sub> concentrations more reflective of in vivo conditions. The responses of <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> to acute hypoxia, SUMO and SENP were studied at lower O<sub>2</sub> concentrations as follows (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1b</a>). First, rat CGN were confirmed to tolerate long-term culture in 7% O<sub>2</sub>, as we previously observed for rat hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shelat et al., 2013</a>). Next, CGN cultured for 7\u201310 days at 7% O<sub>2</sub> were evaluated at 7% O<sub>2</sub> and then on exposure to 1.5% O<sub>2</sub>; the decrease in O<sub>2</sub> led to an acute increase in mean peak <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> of\u00a0~65% and, starting from a baseline for <i>V<sub>\u00bd</sub></i> of \u221242\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5 mV and \u221257\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 mV, <i>V<sub>\u00bd</sub></i> and SSI were left-shifted by \u22128\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 mV and \u221211\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 mV, respectively. Similarly, SUMO1 increased <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> in CGN cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub> by\u00a0~68%, in association with left-shifts in <i>V<sub>\u00bd</sub></i> and SSI of \u2212 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5 mV and \u221212\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 mV, respectively, while SENP1 suppressed <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> by\u00a0~70% and right-shifted <i>V<sub>\u00bd</sub></i> and SSI by 9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 mV and 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 mV, respectively. As observed when CGN were cultured in ambient O<sub>2</sub>, the increase in <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> induced by SUMO1 when cells were incubated at 7% O<sub>2</sub> was not further augmented when O<sub>2</sub> was decreased to 1.5% nor could subsequent exposure to 1.5% O<sub>2</sub> overcome suppression of <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> by SENP1. Finally, like neurons cultured in ambient O<sub>2</sub>, blockade studies with CnTX and AnTTX supported the identification of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 as the channel passing hypoxia-responsive <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> in CGN cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub>, and the proposal that Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 is responsible for the residual current that was insensitive to hypoxia, SUMO1 or SENP1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e\u2013g</a>)."

Thus, SUMO1 in the pipette increased current-density and left-shifted <i>V<sub>\u00bd</sub></i> and SSI to the same extent as acute hypoxia and SENP1 decreased current-density and right-shifted the <i>V<sub>\u00bd</sub></i> and SSI from baseline by\u00a0~75%. The total excursion in <i>V<sub>\u00bd</sub></i> for Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in CHO cells between these treatments favoring SUMOylation and deSUMOylation was 27.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 mV, as it was for CGN <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i>. Moreover, the conclusion drawn from native <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> that shifts in the G-V relationships were the primary determinants of acute changes in current density were supported as well for Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in CHO cells by measurement of similar maximal currents at 0 mV for the various test conditions. Also as observed for CGN <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i>, acute hypoxia did not further augment Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel currents first increased by SUMO1 nor did it abrogate prior SENP1-mediated current suppression."

When CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and SUMO1 tagged with mCherry (mCherry-SUMO1) were co-expressed, particles containing both CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and mCherry-SUMO1 were observed at the plasma membrane. In response to photobleaching, these particles showed only a single bleaching step for each fluorophore under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, indicating the presence of one fluorescent subunit of each type (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a,b</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Acute hypoxia increased the fraction of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 particles with mCherry-SUMO1\u00a0~4-fold (from 20% to 80%), as expected due to hypoxia-induced SUMOylation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>). In contrast, SENP1 in the recording pipette suppressed both baseline and hypoxia-induced SUMOylation of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 by mCherry-SUMO1 so that colocalized particles were decreased (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>). Similarly, expression of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-Lys38Gln and mCherry-SUMO1 rarely yielded colocalization of the fluorophores in both ambient O<sub>2</sub> and hypoxic conditions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d</a>). Because channels are formed with one Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 subunit, observing only a single mCherry-SUMO1 in particles as well confirmed three conclusions: only Lys38 on the \u03b1-subunit was SUMOylated; polySUMO1 chains were not formed; and, the \u03b21 subunit was not SUMOylated."

Here, surface density and localization of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and mCherry-SUMO1 subunits were assessed using TIRF and pixel-by-pixel analysis at room temperature (<a href=\"#bib26\">Manders et al., 1993</a>), a method we have applied to quantify the surface density and co-assembly of cardiac K<sup>+</sup> channel \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits (<a href=\"#bib33\">Plant et al., 2014</a>). In ambient O<sub>2</sub>, just 16% of channel pixels were localized with mCherry-SUMO1 (67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>) and 84% were observed to be unmodified (340\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>). After 2 min of hypoxia, an additional 50% of channel pixels were localized with mCherry-SUMO1, increasing the total to 65% (265\u00a0\u00b1 12/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>) with 35% unmodified by the tagged SUMO (137\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>). Although hypoxia increased the surface density of mCherry-SUMO1 associated\u00a0with\u00a0CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2\u00a0by\u00a0~4-fold, there was no change in the level of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 (407/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup> versus 402/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>) and free mCherry-SUMO1 on the surface remained at low levels (4/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup> versus 12/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>). During 20 min of post-hypoxia recovery in ambient O<sub>2</sub>, the total number of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 surface particles decreased by\u00a0~10% without a change in the fraction of channels localized with mCherry-SUMO1 (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Because current density decreased by just\u00a0~2% over the same period, we suspected that the decrease in fluorescent Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 particles on the surface was due to CFP photobleaching, in-keeping with the idea that neither acute hypoxia-induced SUMOylation nor re-oxygenation led to net addition or removal of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels from the CHO cell\u00a0plasma membrane; a conclusion supported as well by the similar size of CFP-Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 currents recorded at 0 mV in ambient O<sub>2</sub> and 5% O<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1a</a>)."

Briefly, images were captured at 5 s intervals and data for each fluorophore saved as separate stacks; the\u00a0background was subtracted and processed for misalignment in an identical manner. Manders\u2019 coefficients were assessed post-hoc for 3\u20135 regions per cell. Co-localization was defined as the presence of both fluorophores at more than 30% of the maximum fluorescence level recorded in that stack (and their overlap is represented in the\u00a0images as white pixels). The time-course of hypoxic modulation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 current in moving from O<sub>2</sub> of 21% to 5% was studied with steps from \u2013100 mV to \u221220 mV every 10 s and normalized to cell capacitance (pA/pF).

Together, the following observations support the notion that hypoxia acts directly via SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 Lys38: modification of Lys38 is demonstrated directly by FRET and MS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>); hypoxia does not alter the current passed by Na<sub>V</sub>1.2-Lys38Gln channels nor <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> in neurons pretreated with SUMO1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>); hypoxia cannot overcome suppression of <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> by SENP1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>); and, the time-course of SUMOylation of Lys38 matches the increase in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 currents observed when CHO cells are subjected to hypoxia (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). That hypoxia-mediated SUMOylation of Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 is observed in the presence of TTX shows that Na<sup>+</sup> flux is not a prerequisite for channel SUMOylation.

Also consistent with a long-term protective role, cortical neurons isolated from mice and subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation show decreased survival when the translation of SUMO2/3 is suppressed (<a href=\"#bib10\">Datwyler et al., 2011</a>), and increasing SUMOylation by overexpression of Ubc9 is protective in a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemic damage (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2011</a>).

It is notable, therefore, that the immediate effects of ion channel SUMOylation we have observed thus far are excitatory. Here, we show that SUMOylation increases <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> in rat CGN, favoring depolarization and action potential firing. Our earlier work on <i>I<sub>Kso</sub></i> in rat CGN carried by channels with K2P1 subunits showed SUMOylation to decrease that background K<sup>+</sup> conductance that stabilizes cells below firing threshold (<a href=\"#bib34\">Plant et al., 2012</a>). So, too, we found SUMOylation to suppress the voltage-gated, delayed-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current <i>I<sub>DR</sub></i> in rat hippocampal neurons that speeds recovery after excitatory events, due to a rightward shift in the G-V relationship for activation of K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channels (<a href=\"#bib31\">Plant et al., 2011</a>). Of note, we found that SUMO did not regulate hippocampal pyramidal cell <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i>, a current carried predominantly Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gong et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Vacher et al., 2008</a>). This suggests that SUMO regulation of Na<sub>V</sub> channels may be isoform-specific, a notion supported by the failure of the small amount of <i>I<sub>Na</sub></i> in rat CGN that was not carried by Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 to respond to hypoxia, SUMO1 or SENP1, a current we attribute primarily to Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 based on its pharmacology."

In-gel protein trypsin digestion was performed after SDS-PAGE. Samples were analyzed with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 Nano-HPLC System (Sunnyvale,\u00a0CA), Zorbax C18 trapping and analytical columns, and an LTQ-FT tandem MS instrument (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a nanospray source and a picotip nanospray needle (8 \u00b5m id tip; New Objectives,\u00a0Woburn,\u00a0MA) running Xcalibur software. Spectra were acquired using positive ion nano ESI mode with the FT-ICR acquiring precursor spectra from 250\u20131800 m/z at a resolution of 50000 at m/z 400. Tandem mass spectra were acquired in a data-dependent manner using the five most intense ions with charge states of\u00a0+2 or higher from each FT-ICR MS scan to trigger the LTQ performance of collision-induced dissociation (CID) on each of the selected precursor ions using an activation Q of 0.25, a normalized collision energy of 35, and an activation time of 30 ms. The RAW data files from each run were processed with DTA supercharge to generate MGF peak list files and ReadW to produce binary mzXML files (<a href=\"http://tools.proteomecenter.org/software.php\">http://tools.proteomecenter.org/software.php</a>).

In each search, a peptide precursor mass tolerance of 5 ppm was used, allowing for modifications due to additions such as Gly-Gly (+114.04292, Th), up to three missed cleavages, and strict adherence to tryptic digestion rules. Search results were then loaded into Scaffold software (Proteome Software,\u00a0Portland,\u00a0OR) and peptides with scores of 95% confidence or better used to confirm peptide assignments. The LTQ was programmed to accumulate precursor masses of expected peptides and perform dedicated tandem MS of only those ions using the LC conditions above and a multi-event study consisting of single MS scans on the FT-ICR and up to three dedicated MS/MS experiments on the selected masses. Data obtained were extracted as above and subjected to searches and manual evaluation including assessment of molecular weight, spectral quality and consistency of peptides retention time in relation to unmodified versions of the peptide."

In this study, Plant et al. show that SUMOylation of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels within few tens of seconds of hypoxia underlies this excitatory shift in sodium conductance properties. They also provide direct evidence that SUMO1 interacts with Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel and that SUMOylation of a specific lysine in the N-terminus of these channels mediates these responses. Furthermore, they provide evidence that SUMO regulation of sodium current is isoform specific and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 which is also found in rat CGN is not modulated by SUMO1. Overall, this is a solid contribution to the field and shows for the first time that the SUMO pathway is involved in rapid modulation of sodium currents in response to hypoxia."

They measure sodium current at -20 mV, which is about 50% activation for the control condition but manipulation of SUMO shifts the voltage dependence of activation so the changes in sodium currents measured at this fixed potential may be a mixture of changes in V<sub>a</sub> and in G<sub>max</sub>. To me, it would be nice to see both parameters separately, especially since G<sub>max</sub> changes could reflect changes in channel number on the cell surface, in contrast to their conclusions about regulation of channel activity."

This does not conform to expectations of their model (left shifted G-V curves lead to enhanced INa). The manner in which these results are described in the Results subsection \u201cCGN cultured at 7% O<sub>2</sub>\u201d glosses over these findings, and suggests that going from 7% to 1.5% O<sub>2</sub> is pretty much the same as going from 21% to 7%. This is not the case, and this point is critical to their study, as the data support that long term culture in 7% O<sub>2</sub> already leads to substantial (SUMO-based?) changes in Na<sub>V</sub>1.2.
