Stoichiometry is known for a wide array of mammalian transporters, but, due to a lack of readily available tools, not for most of the prokaryotic transporters for which high-resolution structures are available. Here, we describe a general method for using radiolabeled substrate flux assays to determine coupling stoichiometries of electrogenic secondary active transporters reconstituted in proteoliposomes by measuring transporter equilibrium potentials. We demonstrate the utility of this method by determining the coupling stoichiometry of VcINDY, a bacterial Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled succinate transporter, and further validate it by confirming the coupling stoichiometry of vSGLT, a bacterial sugar transporter. This robust thermodynamic method should be especially useful in probing the mechanisms of transporters with available structures."

These integral membrane proteins use established ion gradients to drive their substrates uphill, against their own gradients. Coupling stoichiometry, the stoichiometric ratio of coupling ion to substrate molecules transported per transport cycle, dictates the extent to which a substrate can be moved against its concentration gradient. By coupling the transport of one substrate molecule to several ions, a transporter can generate a large substrate gradient. For example, the glutamate transporter EAAT3 couples the cotransport of 3 Na<sup>+</sup>, 1 H<sup>+</sup>, and counter transport of 1 K<sup>+</sup> to glutamate uptake; in physiological salt solutions, these coupled ions can generate a 5 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> fold glutamate gradient (<a href=\"#bib27\">Zerangue and Kavanaugh, 1996</a>). This ability to robustly clear away extracellular glutamate is critical in the mammalian CNS, where synaptically released glutamate must be removed to prepare a synapse for subsequent signaling events."

In a symporter, for example, transport is initiated by the binding of a full complement of coupling ions and substrates; successful mechanistic analysis, by experiment or by computation requires a clear determination of these key parameters. Many X-ray structures of transporters do not reveal all the ions and substrates required to initiate transport (<a href=\"#bib12\">Mancusso et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Reyes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Yernool et al., 2004</a>).

However, the information yielded by these methods strongly depends on the choice of kinetic model and can be misleading (<a href=\"#bib11\">Lolkema and Slotboom, 2015</a>). Alternatively, stoichiometry can be assessed by analyzing the parallel uptake of radiolabeled substrate and radioactive coupling ion (<a href=\"#bib7\">Groeneveld and Slotboom, 2010</a>). However, many candidate coupling ions are unavailable in radioactive form, or are difficult to use, particularly <sup>22</sup>Na<sup>+</sup>, which is highly radioactive and binds to many of the surfaces used in transport assays (<a href=\"#bib7\">Groeneveld and Slotboom, 2010</a>)."

The measurement of reversal potentials fulfills these requirements, providing a thermodynamic route to transporter coupling ratios. In contrast to the Hill coefficient, this approach yields stoichiometry without requiring any prior knowledge of the transport mechanism. For an electrogenic secondary transporter, equilibrium occurs when the downhill diffusional \u2018force\u2019 due to substrate and ion gradients is exactly balanced by the voltage generated in each cycle by the separation of charge induced by substrate movement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This voltage is predicted by a simple equation that involves the magnitudes of ion and substrate gradients, and the charges and stoichiometries of the ions involved (see Materials and methods for derivation). If the voltage at the membrane deviates from this equilibrium value, substrate and ion will move in response (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a,c</a>). Thus, if we apply a series of voltages to the system and observe substrate flux, in either direction across the membrane, the system must not be at equilibrium. At a voltage, on the other hand, where no net flux occurs, the system must be at equilibrium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). This voltage is commonly referred to as the \u2018reversal potential\u2019 as the ion and substrate fluxes change direction when the voltage traverses this value."

It is critical to bracket the reversal potential with both inward and outward substrate fluxes; we thus confirm that the absence of flux reflects equilibrium rather than the absence of transport activity. In traditional flux measurements, radiolabeled substrate is introduced either inside or outside the proteoliposomes, permitting flux measurements in only one direction. Here, in contrast, we add labeled substrate at known concentrations to both sides of the membrane, permitting the system to generate all three required flux conditions, inward, outward and none."

To account for this variation in t\u00a0=\u00a00 values between different voltages, we normalized the dataset for each voltage by its 5 s time-point (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>).

In theory, this method can be used for any secondary transporter for which radiolabeled substrates are available, although it will be most applicable to Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled transporters, due to other viable options available for proton-driven systems (<a href=\"#bib6\">Graves et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Parker et al., 2014</a>)."

Another approach that has been used to determine transporter coupling ratios is the static head method (<a href=\"#bib24\">Turner and Moran, 1982</a>). As in our reversal potential-based method, the static head method sets out to find conditions in which there is no net flux of substrate by balancing oppositely\u00a0directed substrate and coupling ion gradients at 0 voltage. In the static head method, accurately balancing the substrate and coupling ion gradients becomes difficult when multiple ions are coupled to substrate transport; a prime example is the situation with VcINDY where three Na<sup>+</sup> ions are coupled to the transport of one succinate molecule. In this case, to balance a 10:1 outwardly\u00a0directed substrate gradient, a 1:1000 inwardly\u00a0directed coupling ion gradient is required. Under these conditions, even very small leaks can become substantial problems and errors in buffer composition are magnified. A trace leak in such a case would lead to an underestimation of the concentrating power of the transporter (<a href=\"#bib17\">Parker et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, the reversal potential-based method uses moderate substrate and coupling ion concentrations, thus sidestepping this issue."

Measuring transport phenomena in proteoliposomes has several advantages over other experimental systems available for bacterial and archaeal transporters, such as, whole cells or membrane vesicles. First, accurate stoichiometry measurements cannot be performed in whole cells, where the experimenter has little control over the internal solutions. Close control of the electrochemical gradients is a key requirement to the success of our reversal potential-based method (as well as the static head method). While a reversal potential-based experiment can feasibly be performed using native membrane vesicles, as was the case for the cardiac Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>+</sup> exchanger (<a href=\"#bib18\">Reeves and Hale, 1984</a>), a proteoliposome-centered method is more broadly applicable as it circumvents some of the limitations of using membrane vesicles. The paramount issue with using vesicles derived from native membranes is the presence of endogenous transporters and membrane associated enzymes whose activity may obscure the activity of the transporter of interest. In proteoliposomes, as the protein of interest is reconstituted in isolation, the user can be absolutely certain that only one substrate and coupling ion conducting protein is present in the membrane. Multiple routes for substrate and coupling ion movement will confound analysis and lead to inaccurate coupling ratios. Finally, if necessary, the lipid composition and transport protein density can be modulated in proteoliposomes to optimize transport and minimize substrate and coupling ion leak (<a href=\"#bib22\">Tsai and Miller, 2013</a>). Such modifications are not possible with membrane vesicles where the user is saddled with the protein and lipid that is present in the source material."

Most obviously, this method is only applicable to electrogenic transporters. Clearly, the method is most useful for Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled transporters; if the transporter also couples to K<sup>+</sup>, for example, the use of valinomycin/K<sup>+</sup> to set voltage will be compromised. In theory, pH gradients combined with the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) could be used to set the potential, but we have not attempted this. However, among the known bacterial transporters (for which this method is intended) few are known to utilize K<sup>+</sup>. For those that\u00a0do,\u00a0the K<sup>+</sup> concentrations required for transporter effects are quite high and could be avoided in practice (<a href=\"#bib20\">R\u00fcbenhagen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Billesb\u00f8lle et al., 2016</a>). Also, some transporters manifest an uncoupled Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ryan and Mindell, 2007</a>). Depending on the relative fluxes through this pathway compared with the coupled transport pathway this could also perturb stoichiometry measurements. Again, we believe that these complications are rare, and the method will be useful for the vast majority of Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled prokaryotic transporters."

The leak is reproducible under these conditions, but not seen in other experiments (not shown) at negative voltages. Control experiments with protein-free liposomes show no evidence of succinate loss (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>), suggesting that the effect is mediated by the VcINDY protein. Despite this small leak, we were still able to unambiguously determine a 3:1 coupling ratio for VcINDY by using the 30 s timepoints only, before the leak has substantially contributed to the observed efflux, and combining these measurements with those performed under other conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Additionally, it is very unlikely that we would have observed consistent reversal potential results over a large span of voltages if we were not accurately clamping the membrane potential. Note that it is also important to consider the limited internal volume of the vesicles used in these experiments. For a 400 nm vesicle containing 1 \u00b5M substrate, that represents around 20 molecules of substrate\u2014at lower substrate concentrations (or in smaller vesicles) there could easily be only one or a few molecules per vesicle. Averaged over a large population (billions used in these experiments), this may still be sufficient to observe substrate efflux at appropriate vesicles, but problems or inconsistencies could arise from such low substrate numbers."

However, knowing certain mechanistic details will make determining the coupling stoichiometry more practical. As a starting point, it is essential to know what ions are coupled to substrate transport, since all these will contribute to determining the reversal potential. For example, if a proton is surreptitiously coupled to transport then failing to account for it in the E<sub>rev</sub> calculations would clearly lead to incorrect results. Knowing the charge of the substrate and the number of substrates that are transported per cycle is also beneficial, as it will decrease the number of assays required to obtain the coupling ratio. In our experience, the transporter in question will ideally have a reasonably high apparent affinity for the radiolabeled substrate (low \u03bcM range). As we observed for vSGLT (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), large substrate gradients may be necessary to achieve resolvable voltage differences and, as a consequence of this, the substrate concentration on one side of the membrane will, by necessity, be quite low. If a low-affinity transporter is being probed, then the substrate concentration on one side of the membrane may be too far below the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> to observe flux in this direction in the timeframe of the experiment. As a starting point, we recommend that the substrate concentrations on either side of the membrane should be kept to within 1/10th of the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> to achieve measureable transport rates within the duration of the assay. It is also important to ensure that there is sufficient substrate in the vesicles. At 1 \u03bcM, there are on the order of 10\u201320 substrate molecules in each vesicle. Our efflux results demonstrate that this is sufficient to make the needed measurement (especially averaged over the\u00a0~10<sup>10</sup> vesicles in each experiment), but lower concentrations could be problematic."

VcINDY, which was recently demonstrated to utilize an elevator-like protein movement to transport substrate across the membrane (<a href=\"#bib14\">Mulligan et al., 2016</a>), is the only structurally characterized member of the DASS family and currently acts as an experimentally tractable model protein with which to probe the mechanism of this family, which includes several human proteins that could be targeted in the treatment of metabolic diseases and diabetes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bergeron et al., 2013</a>). It is therefore vital to thoroughly understand VcINDY\u2019s structural and energetic mechanism.

Computational approaches, such as molecular dynamic simulations, are powerful methods of predicting and testing, in silico, coupling ion locations. However, these procedures need experimental validation and are only as accurate as the data that is input. The reversal potential-based method we describe provides both unambiguous coupling ion stoichiometries to improve the accuracy of these computational approaches and a means of testing subsequent computational predictions.

Briefly, BL21-AI (Life Technologies\u00a0Carlsbad, CA) was transformed with a pET vector containing the VcINDY gene in-frame with an N-terminal deca-histidine tag. Cells were cultured in LB supplemented with 300 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin to until A<sub>600</sub> 0.8 was reached and then cooled in an ice-water bath for 20 min. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.1 M IPTG and 6.6 mM L-arabinose to the cultures. Cultures were incubated overnight at 19\u00b0C, then harvested and lysed using a homogenizer (EmulsiFlex-C3; Avestin). The lysate was clarified and membrane vesicles were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Membrane vesicles were then resuspended in Purification Buffer (PB) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mM NaCl and 5% (vol/vol) glycerol and solubilized by adding n-dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside (DDM; Anatrace) to a final concentration of 20 mM. Insoluble matter was removed by ultracentrifugation, and the soluble supernatant was incubated with TALON-affinity resin (Takara Bio Inc.) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Weakly bound impurities were eluted with two consecutive 20 column volume washing steps, the first with PB supplemented with 2 mM DDM and 10 mM imidazole and the secondwith buffer containing 20 mM imidazole.

No additional radiolabeled substrate was added to the Reaction Buffer, so diluting the isotope-loaded proteoliposomes (which will have significant extra-liposomal radiolabeled substrate present) into the Reaction Buffer was sufficient to set the desired substrate gradient. The extent of proteoliposome dilution was therefore dictated by the succinate gradient we wished to achieve. Samples were taken at the specified timepoints, rapidly filtered on 0.22-\u03bcm nitrocellulose membranes (Merck Millipore) to collect the proteoliposomes, then washed by addition of 4 ml of ice-cold Quench Buffer (20 mM Tris/HEPES, ChCl osmotically balanced to inside buffer). The filters were dried, dissolved in liquid scintillation cocktail (FilterCount, PerkinElmer), and counted on a Trilux \u03b2 counter (PerkinElmer). The initial point (t\u00a0=\u00a00) value was determined by diluting preloaded proteoliposomes directly into ice-cold 2 ml Quench Buffer, rapidly filtering and washing with 4 ml of Quench Buffer. No initial point was taken for vSGLT; instead a 5 s time-point was taken to act as the initial value."

The authors should briefly discuss how uncoupled chloride conductance (observed in some transporters such as GltPh) would affect the measurements. Some transporters (e.g. MelB) can use either sodium ions or protons as coupling ion. Because the authors present the method as \"generic\" they should briefly discuss what are the consequences of such promiscuity. In some cases, such as in LeuT, for example, transport is also coupled to counter-transport of protons. Such coupling can lead to artificially lower coupling stoichiometry for a given transporter. What test one would run to ensure that there is no \"hidden\" coupling to protons?"

There was a consensus that background leak should be determined, perhaps using protein-free liposomes. The authors make a strong statement about the advantages of using proteoliposomes being \"uncontaminated by leak pathways\" (Results, fourth paragraph), yet they clearly suffer from leaks. Furthermore, it is not clear that timepoint taken at 30s makes it possible to avoid problems caused by the leaks. Clearly the leak will be there from timepoint 0 onward. Therefore, the dashed line in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> is really very misleading. It suggests that the authors believe that there is no leakage in the first 30 s of the measurement, after which it magically starts. The interpretation of this data should be phrased much more carefully."

At 1 \u03bcm internal substrate and small liposomes (which might be on average around 200 nm) there are only a few molecules of substrate inside the liposomes and a proportion of liposomes might be empty. Unlike classical cell-based experiments, in which there are essentially \"infinite\" amounts of substrates and ions and steady state fluxes are measured, in the liposome experiments, stochasticity may play a significant role. It is not entirely clear whether it will affect determination of \"reversal potential\" (if this term is truly applicable here). The authors should discuss this point carefully. Furthermore, reviewers generally felt that it would have been worthwhile to confirm that identical results are obtained when higher internal concentrations of the substrate are used."

Because the authors present the method as \"generic\" they should briefly discuss what are the consequences of such promiscuity. In some cases, such as in LeuT, for example, transport is also coupled to counter-transport of protons. Such coupling can lead to artificially lower coupling stoichiometry for a given transporter. What test one would run to ensure that there is no \"hidden\" coupling to protons?</i>"

There was a consensus that background leak should be determined, perhaps using protein-free liposomes. The authors make a strong statement about the advantages of using proteoliposomes being \"uncontaminated by leak pathways\" (Results, fourth paragraph), yet they clearly suffer from leaks. Furthermore, it is not clear that timepoint taken at 30s makes it possible to avoid problems caused by the leaks. Clearly the leak will be there from timepoint 0 onward. Therefore, the dashed line in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> is really very misleading. It suggests that the authors believe that there is no leakage in the first 30 s of the measurement, after which it magically starts. The interpretation of this data should be phrased much more carefully.</i>"

We see no leak of substrate in protein-free liposomes, suggesting that the vcINDY protein itself is mediating the observed efflux. In addition, a quick and dirty experiment with different conditions also predicted to give rise to a negative reversal potential gave results again consistent with 3/1 stoichiometry and no evidence of leak, further supporting our conclusions. We are left speculating that the leak must develop over time, or that the voltage is somehow shifting during the experiment. We are still convinced of the result, given the consistency with two+ other experimental conditions, and will follow up this observation with more experiments in the future (Discussion, sixth paragraph, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

At 1 \u03bcm internal substrate and small liposomes (which might be on average around 200 nm) there are only a few molecules of substrate inside the liposomes and a proportion of liposomes might be empty. Unlike classical cell-based experiments, in which there are essentially \"infinite\" amounts of substrates and ions and steady state fluxes are measured, in the liposome experiments, stochasticity may play a significant role. It is not entirely clear whether it will affect determination of \"reversal potential\" (if this term is truly applicable here). The authors should discuss this point carefully. Furthermore, reviewers generally felt that it would have been worthwhile to confirm that identical results are obtained when higher internal concentrations of the substrate are used.</i>"

However, we do not consider these issues to be critical for these experiments. A rough calculation suggests that there are about 20 molecules of substrate in each liposome on average. If these are Poisson distributed, the standard deviation is therefore about 4 molecules, so the overwhelming majority of the vesicles will have 16-24 molecules of substrate. From our data, this is clearly sufficient to provide enough internal counts that we can observe efflux at appropriate voltages. We are also aided the by the macroscopic nature of the experiment, with on the order of 10<sup>10</sup> liposomes per measurement. We added a sentence to the Discussion about this (eighth paragraph)."
