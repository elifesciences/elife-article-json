Collectively, the resources support the generation of HLA allele-specific peptide assay libraries consisting of consensus fragment ion spectra, and the analysis of quantitative digital maps of HLA peptidomes generated from a range of biological sources by SWATH mass spectrometry (MS). This study represents the first community-based effort to develop a robust platform for the reproducible and quantitative measurement of the entire repertoire of peptides presented by HLA molecules, an essential step towards the design of efficient immunotherapies."

Collectively, the resources support the generation of HLA allele-specific peptide assay libraries consisting of consensus fragment ion spectra, and the analysis of quantitative digital maps of HLA peptidomes generated from a range of biological sources by SWATH mass spectrometry (MS). This study represents the first community-based effort to develop a robust platform for the reproducible and quantitative measurement of the entire repertoire of peptides presented by HLA molecules, an essential step towards the design of efficient immunotherapies."

T cells play a critical role in such therapies by their ability to detect the presence of disease-specific antigens/peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] molecules in humans). Under steady-state or pathological conditions, thousands of HLA class I-associated peptides of 8\u201312 amino acids in length are displayed on the surface of virtually all nucleated cells for scrutiny by CD8+ T cells. HLA class II-associated peptides are 10\u201325 amino acids in length and are normally found on the surface of specialized antigen-presenting cells including macrophages and dendritic cells for presentation to CD4+ T cells. Collectively, HLA class I and class II peptides are referred to as the immunopeptidome, also known as HLA ligandome/peptidome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Caron et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kowalewski et al., 2014</a>). The composition of the immunopeptidome in the human population is complicated by the presence of more than 3000 HLA alleles, resulting in a high diversity of peptide repertoires characterized by the presence of HLA allele-specific binding motifs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Falk et al., 1991</a>). To be successful in designing efficient immunotherapies against autoimmunity, cancer and infectious diseases, it is becoming increasingly important to comprehensively map the complexity of the human immunopeptidome and to gain a more quantitative understanding of its dynamics in various disease states."

                        "text": "Mass spectrometry (MS) has evolved as the method of choice for the exploration of the human immunopeptidome (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hunt et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Admon and Bassani-Sternberg, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Granados et al., 2015</a>). The largest HLA peptidomes reported to date using MS contain more than 10,000 class I or class II peptides (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hassan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bergseng et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bassani-Sternberg et al., 2015</a>). Estimates from various analytical and cell-based techniques also indicate that individual peptides are expressed on average at 50 copies per cell with extremes ranging from 1 to 10,000 copies per cell (<a href=\"#bib15\">Granados et al., 2015</a>). Until recently, the most common strategy for the analysis of immunopeptidomes by MS has focused on the isolation of HLA-bound peptides by immunoaffinity chromatography and the collection of fragment ion spectra of selected peptides through automated MS operated in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. Although DDA is a powerful strategy for exploring the peptidomic content of various cell and tissue types, it is not a reliable platform for solving problems that require the comparison of comprehensive, quantitative, and reproducible data sets across many samples or conditions. In fact, analyses of complex/unfractionated digests of cell lysate using DDA have shown that as many as 84% of peptides may remain unselected for fragmentation even though they are clearly detectable by the mass spectrometer (<a href=\"#bib35\">Michalski et al., 2011</a>). Although the complexity of isolated HLA peptides is hardly comparable with that of cell lysate digests, as many as 20% of the selected HLA peptides can vary between replicate analyses of the same sample (<a href=\"#bib16\">Granados et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). A second strategy, referred to as selected/multiple reaction monitoring (S/MRM), is a targeting MS technique capable of generating highly reproducible, quantitatively accurate and sensitive datasets (<a href=\"#bib37\">Picotti and Aebersold, 2012</a>). S/MRM is, however, limited by its capacity to detect only tens to hundreds of peptides per sample injection and thus is not ideally suited to comprehensively quantify HLA peptidomes. To overcome this limitation, we recently introduced SWATH-MS, a new mass spectrometric technique that combines data-independent acquisition (DIA) with a targeted data extraction strategy (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gillet et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">R\u00f6st et al., 2014</a>). In DIA mode, all peptides in a sample are fragmented and the corresponding fragment ion spectra are acquired, resulting in a digital recording of the peptide sample. DIA is an unbiased MS technique and therefore represents a suitable strategy for efficiently generating consistent, reproducible and quantitatively accurate measurements of peptides across multiple samples (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gillet et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Collins et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Rosenberger et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">R\u00f6st et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Guo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Schubert et al., 2015a</a>)."

Such libraries contain retention-time and fragmentation information of the peptides to be targeted. Assay libraries are generated from native and/or synthetic peptides using a SWATH compatible mass spectrometer operated in DDA mode. To date, several generic SWATH assay libraries were generated for the analysis of proteomes in various species. These include <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schubert et al., 2015a</a>), <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib45\">Selevsek et al., 2015</a>), and <i>Homo sapiens</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rosenberger et al., 2014</a>).

Generating such assay libraries could ultimately enable the fast and reproducible quantification of the entire repertoire of HLA peptides across many samples. Towards this end, we developed a workflow to (1) generate a pilot repository of HLA allele-specific peptide spectral and assay libraries, and to (2) analyze SWATH-MS HLA peptidomic data acquired from multiple international laboratories (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In this study, libraries were created from natural and/or synthetic HLA class I and II peptides whereas analysis of SWATH-MS HLA peptidomic data focused mainly on naturally presented class I peptides."

                        "text": "To test our workflow, the generated data and computational resources, we first assessed the feasibility of generating HLA class I allele-specific peptide spectral libraries from a panel of fourteen PBMC samples (PBMC #1\u201314) expressing different combinations of HLA class I alleles. HLA class I-bound peptides were isolated from HLA-typed PBMC's by immunoaffinity chromatography and analyzed by DDA on an Orbitrap-XL mass spectrometer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Peptides were identified using multiple open-source database search engines. The search identifications were combined and statistically scored using PeptideProphet and iProphet within the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) as shown previously (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shteynberg et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2013</a>). We next annotated the identified peptides to their respective HLA allele. Previously, HLA binding prediction algorithms such as SYFPETHI, NetMHC and SMM were used for manual or semi-automated annotation of HLA peptides (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fortier et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berlin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Granados et al., 2014</a>). Here, we designed a fully automated annotation strategy integrating the stand-alone software package of the HLA binding prediction algorithm NetMHC 3.4 with a set of in-house software tools (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The in-house software tools enable an automated, consistent and effective annotation of the majority of the identified peptides to their respective HLA allele (<a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Briefly, each identified peptide was given a predicted HLA binding affinity (IC<sub>50</sub>) for each of the HLA alleles expressed in the corresponding healthy donor. An HLA annotation score was then computed for each individual peptide by dividing its second best IC<sub>50</sub> value (i.e., the second best predicted allele) by its best IC<sub>50</sub> value (i.e., the best predicted allele). The higher this annotation score was, the higher the probability was for the peptide to be correctly annotated to a specific HLA allele. As an example, in PMBC#2, an annotation score of 77 was computed for the KLEEQARAK peptide by dividing 21,400 nM (second best IC<sub>50</sub> value predicted for HLA-B39) by 278 nM (best IC<sub>50</sub> value predicted for HLA-A03) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Peptides with an HLA annotation score \u22653 (selected cutoff value; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) were systematically annotated to the allele predicted to bind best (e.g., HLA-A03 for the KLEEQARAK peptide). Using this scoring strategy, \u223c80% of all identified 8\u201312-mers were annotated to a specific HLA-A or -B allele (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). HLA-A and -B alleles were prioritized due to the high reliability of the NetMHC 3.4 predictor for a broad diversity of HLA-A and -B alleles as well as for their high expression levels (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kim et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bassani-Sternberg et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Trolle et al., 2015</a>). Peptides with an annotation score below 3 were considered as non-annotated in this study and were discarded for the process of building the HLA allele-specific peptide spectral libraries. Tables including scored peptides were then used to generate heat maps and visualize HLA-A and -B peptidomes of PBMC's as described (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Of note, allele-supertype peptides (i.e., peptides predicted to strongly bind more than one allele with an IC<sub>50</sub> below 500 nM) were curated in the output files but were not visualized on the heat maps in this study. A corrected false discovery rate (cFDR) was estimated for each PBMC sample following removal of all non-annotated contaminant peptides (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), resulting in a total of 4153 (peptide-level FDR 1%; average cFDR 0.5%) or 7921 (peptide-level FDR 5%; average cFDR 2.5%) distinct annotated peptides distributed across eighteen HLA class I alleles (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 3</a>). All annotated peptides identified from the 14 PBMC samples were then used in SpectraST (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lam et al., 2008</a>) to build the HLA class I allele-specific peptide spectral libraries (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The same procedure was applied to peptides identified from JY<sup>EBV+</sup> and C1R cells. Notably, endogenous HLA-C04 peptides were recently shown to be significantly expressed on the surface of C1R cells (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schittenhelm et al., 2014b</a>) and were therefore considered in this study. In total, 3528 HLA-A peptides, 4208 HLA-B peptides and 205 HLA-C04 peptides were recorded in the spectral libraries, which were then stored in the public PeptideAtlas database (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 4</a>). In summary, we generated a computational workflow to effectively annotate and visualize HLA peptidomic data, which were finally converted and stored into HLA allele-specific peptide spectral libraries consisting of consensus fragment ion spectra. This strategy could be further refined to collect, store and share HLA peptidomic information obtained from various cell lines and from larger cohorts of donors. Importantly, this computational approach can be broadly applied to generate SWATH-compatible assay libraries as described below."

Here, we aimed at initiating a worldwide community-based effort to generate pilot HLA allele-specific peptide assay libraries that could be further used for the analysis of SWATH-MS HLA peptidomic data. Naturally presented and/or synthetic HLA class I and class II peptides were provided from six independent laboratories and were analyzed using four distinct TripleTOF 5600 MS instruments operated in DDA acquisition mode in four different international institutions. Naturally presented HLA class I peptides from JY<sup>EBV+</sup> (HLA-A02 and -B07), PBMC (HLA-A03, -A26, -B51 and -B57), and Jurkat (HLA-A03, -B07 and -B35) cells were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Natural class I peptides from three C1R cell lines\u2014stably expressing HLA-C04 as well as HLA-B27, -B39 or -B40 molecules\u2014were also isolated using the same procedure. Synthetic EBV-derived peptides known to bind HLA-A02 or -B07 were also used to build the libraries (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). All laboratories used the spiked-in landmark iRT peptides for retention time normalization (<a href=\"#bib11\">Escher et al., 2012</a>). The DDA data generated by the different groups were shared and pipelined through the computational workflow described above, resulting in the identification of 7668 (peptide-level FDR 1%; average cFDR 0.5%) or 11,275 (peptide-level FDR 5%; average cFDR 2.5%) distinct HLA class I peptides distributed across eleven different HLA class I alleles (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 3</a>). To properly assess the efficiency of generating HLA peptide assay libraries from synthetic peptides, a large collection of 20,176 synthetic HLA class II peptides was analyzed by DDA using different mass spectrometers and fragmentation methods (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). Our results show that a total of 15,875 peptides (\u223c79%) were identified (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). A large collection of synthetic HLA class I peptides was not available but could be used in the future to extend the contents of the present class I libraries derived from native peptides. All identified peptides were used to build the HLA allele-specific peptide assay libraries (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). To date, the pilot libraries contain a total of 223,735 transitions for 26,857 unique peptides and were stored by class and allele in the SWATHAtlas database (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 5</a> and <a href=\"http://www.swathatlas.org/\">http://www.swathatlas.org</a>). By using the automated HLA peptide annotation method described above, we observed that similar binding affinities were predicted for HLA class I peptides identified at peptide-level FDR 1% and peptide-level FDR 5% (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), suggesting that a large fraction of true positives were excluded at peptide-level FDR 1%. Our data also show that 95% of the annotated class I peptides in this study were predicted to bind their respective HLA molecules with an IC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 72 nM (for HLA-A01) to 5682 nM (for HLA-B51) at peptide-level FDR 1% (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Similar results were obtained at peptide-level FDR 5% (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). This result supports a recent study indicating that HLA class I alleles are associated with peptide-binding repertoires of different affinity (<a href=\"#bib36\">Paul et al., 2013</a>). Altogether, we demonstrated the feasibility of collecting DDA data from multiple international laboratories to generate standardized HLA allele-specific peptide assay libraries. We anticipate this global effort as a first step towards the development of a standardized Pan-human HLA peptide assay library, which could be used to rapidly and reproducibly quantify the entire repertoire of peptides presented by HLA molecules using SWATH-MS."

                        "text": "SWATH-MS is emerging as a robust next-generation proteomics technique for efficiently generating reproducible, consistent and quantitatively accurate measurements of peptides across multiple samples (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gillet et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Collins et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Rosenberger et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">R\u00f6st et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Guo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Selevsek et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Schubert et al., 2015a</a>). To promote the worldwide development of SWATH-based MS platforms towards robust quantitative measurements of HLA peptidomes, we assessed whether the HLA allele-specific assay libraries described above could be used to extract quantitative information from digital SWATH maps acquired by different laboratories. Importantly, four independent laboratories generated their own digital SWATH maps using TripleTOF 5600 MS operated in DIA acquisition mode. Naturally presented HLA class I peptides were isolated from the cell types mentioned above (i.e., JY<sup>EBV+</sup>, Jurkat, PBMC and C1R). Precursors in the range of 400\u20131200 Th were divided into 32 SWATH windows of 25 Da (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gillet et al., 2012</a>). All ionized peptide precursors in this mass range were fragmented, generating comprehensive and quantitative digital fragment ion maps. The HLA peptidome of JY<sup>EBV+</sup> cells was analyzed using the OpenSWATH (<a href=\"#bib39\">R\u00f6st et al., 2014</a>) software tool and a combined assay library containing 22,206 transitions for 1507 HLA-A02 and 2194 HLA-B07 peptides\u2014the two dominant HLA alleles expressed on these cells. At an estimated peptide-level FDR of 1% (m-score &lt; 0.01), a total of 3150 unique HLA class I peptides were identified from the digital SWATH map (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Notably, assays generated from the synthetic EBV-related class I peptides enabled the identification of one EBV-derived HLA-A02 peptide (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), thereby demonstrating that building high-quality assay libraries from synthetic class I peptides of pathogen origin could be useful for the identification of non-self HLA-bound peptides by SWATH-MS. To analyze self-HLA peptides isolated from PBMC (HLA-A03, -A26, -B51 and -B57), Jurkat (HLA-A03, B07 and -B35), C1R-B27 (HLA-B27) and C1R-B40 (HLA-B40) cells, the matching HLA class I allele-specific peptide assay libraries were combined accordingly using SpectraST and then processed in the OpenSWATH software. High-throughput targeted analysis from these four additional peptidomic datasets indicated that \u223c81% of HLA class I peptides present in an assay library could be extracted from a quantitative digital SWATH map in a cell type-independent manner (peptide-level FDR 1%) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2\u20136</a> and <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). We next optimized the SWATH acquisition conditions according to the size distribution of HLA class I peptides. Most class I peptide precursors (\u223c98%) fall within the range of 400\u2013700 Th and were divided in 30 SWATH windows of 10 Da width each. Using SWATH data generated from JY<sup>EBV+</sup> cells, we found that narrowing the size of the windows by 2.5-fold resulted in a \u223c13% fold-increase in the identification of class I peptides (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The <i>R</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> value for SWATH-MS quantification was 0.979 from two technical replicates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In accordance with previous studies, we also observed that the dynamic range of peptides quantified in different cell types using SWATH-MS, based on their signal intensity, was about 3-4 orders of magnitude (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hassan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bassani-Sternberg et al., 2015</a>). Altogether, we demonstrate the feasibility of an international effort to build standardized HLA allele-specific peptide assay libraries, which were used to extract quantitative information from digital SWATH maps acquired in different sites. We therefore provide a proof of concept that acquisition of SWATH-MS HLA peptidomic data may enable robust analysis of the human immunopeptidome on a global scale."

For this purpose, we prepared a sample of class I peptides by immunoaffinity purification from JY<sup>EBV+</sup> cells and we acquired three datasets in SWATH mode. The datasets were analyzed using OpenSWATH and a combined HLA-A02 and -B07 peptide assay library as described above. At an estimated peptide-level FDR of 1%, a total of 2933 unique HLA class I peptides were identified by SWATH-MS and 2832 peptides (97%) were found in all the SWATH analyses (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). We then conducted a comparative analysis by acquiring three additional datasets in DDA mode from the same sample of class I peptides using the same chromatographic conditions. In total, 3153 HLA-A and -B peptides were identified at 1% peptide-level FDR and 1261 peptides (40%) were found in all the DDA analyses (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Thus, the SWATH method clearly outperformed the DDA approach for the reproducible identification of JY<sup>EBV+</sup> HLA class I peptides across several technical replicates. Overall, our results indicate that SWATH-MS has the capability of detecting large numbers of HLA peptides across multiple injections at a high degree of reproducibility. By providing a community resource for the continuous expansion of the library contents and by improving the performance of the OpenSWATH software, it can be expected that additional HLA peptides\u2014including cryptic and mutant peptides\u2014will be reproducibly identified and quantified from the same digital SWATH maps in the future."

Similarly, robust generation and analysis of quantitative digital maps of HLA peptidomes is expected to have important implications in basic and translational research as these will allow research groups to accurately investigate the dynamics of immunopeptidomes in various immune-related diseases such as autoimmunity, infectious diseases and cancers. For instance, reproducible digital mapping of tumor-specific mutant HLA peptides during cancer progression will facilitate stratification of patients who might best benefit from innovative immunotherapeutic interventions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gubin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Snyder et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Schumacher et al., 2015</a>). The workflow and the computational and data resources presented in this community-based study is a first step towards highly reproducible and quantitative MS-based measurements of HLA peptidomes across many samples and could therefore be greatly beneficial in the design of personalized immune-based therapies. Moreover, the storage of HLA peptide spectral and assay libraries by class and allele in the SWATHAtlas database provides an initial framework to collect, organize and share HLA peptidomic data, thereby supporting the recently proposed Human Immunopeptidome and Vaccines Projects (<a href=\"#bib1\">Admon and Bassani-Sternberg, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Koff et al., 2014</a>)."

An HLA annotation score was computed by the software tools for individual peptides (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A predefined cutoff score of 3 was then used to annotate each peptide to their respective HLA allele. A cutoff value of 3 was selected because &gt;90% of the identified peptides with an annotation score above 3 have a predicted IC<sub>50</sub> below 1000 nM. FDR was corrected from the list of annotated HLA peptides based on the target-decoy approach (<a href=\"#bib9\">Elias and Gygi, 2007</a>). The software tools were used to process and visualize the peptidomic datasets. The final lists of HLA-allele specific peptides were exported into a .txt file and used in SpectraST for library generation."

The manuscript is based on an international collaboration between a few laboratories specializing in HLA immunopeptidome analysis and the laboratory of Dr. Aebersold, who developed the SWATH_MS methodology. In the past, HLA peptides were mostly identified by shotgun proteomics, which is based on the selection of peptides from purified pools of peptides for fragmentation in the mass spectrometer during the LC-MS-MS analysis. The SWATH_MS approach does not select specific peptides for fragmentation, but instead scans repetitively incremental mass windows of about 25 mass units, every time fragmenting all the peptides that are present in each of these mass windows. The method allows fragmenting all the peptides which have the mass divided by charge of the mass region being scanned more than once. The advantage of this approach is the better reproducibility of the data while the disadvantage is the lower sensitivity and the need to establish beforehand a library of spectra of the individual peptides that will be used for identification by the SWATH-MS approach. The use of the peptide preparations and the LC-MS-MS data from the different collaborating labs resulted in successful establishment of a large repository of peptides and their spectra libraries in a format that will be made public and will serve a large community of researchers, enabling better collaborations."

Combining results of multiple search engines in proteomics has been shown to be beneficial using particular softwares such as MSblender, PepArML and iProphet (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shteynberg et al. 2013</a>). In <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, the venn diagrams were essentially used to roughly compare and visualize the numbers of HLA class I peptides identified by different search engines. However, neither the unions nor the intersections of the venn diagrams were used to build the spectral libraries. Here, the software iProphet was used to combine the search results generated by Comet, MS-GF+ and X!Tandem. In fact, iProphet allows accurate and effective integration of the results from multiple database search engines applied to the same data (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shteynberg et al. 2011</a>). In the revised version of the manuscript, we added a new table in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. The new table shows the numbers of HLA class I peptides obtained from the iProphet combined search results that were used to build the spectral libraries. The new table also shows the sum of peptides identified by the three search engines (Union) as well as the number of overlapping peptides (Intersection) for each Venn diagram/sample. Notably, the numbers of peptides obtained from \u2018iProphet\u2019 and \u2018Union\u2019 are very similar although not identical. In the revised version of the manuscript, we now state (Results and Discussion): \u201cPeptides were identified using multiple open-source database search engines.
