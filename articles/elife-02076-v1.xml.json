                    "text": "Cerebellar climbing fiber activity encodes performance errors during many motor learning tasks, but the role of these error signals in learning has been controversial. We compared two motor learning paradigms that elicited equally robust putative error signals in the same climbing fibers: learned increases and decreases in the gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). During VOR-increase training, climbing fiber activity on one trial predicted changes in cerebellar output on the next trial, and optogenetic activation of climbing fibers to mimic their encoding of performance errors was sufficient to implant a motor memory. In contrast, during VOR-decrease training, there was no trial-by-trial correlation between climbing fiber activity and changes in cerebellar output, and climbing fiber activation did not induce VOR-decrease learning. Our data suggest that the ability of climbing fibers to induce plasticity can be dynamically gated in vivo, even under conditions where climbing fibers are robustly activated by performance errors."

We compared two motor learning paradigms that elicited equally robust putative error signals in the same climbing fibers: learned increases and decreases in the gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). During VOR-increase training, climbing fiber activity on one trial predicted changes in cerebellar output on the next trial, and optogenetic activation of climbing fibers to mimic their encoding of performance errors was sufficient to implant a motor memory. In contrast, during VOR-decrease training, there was no trial-by-trial correlation between climbing fiber activity and changes in cerebellar output, and climbing fiber activation did not induce VOR-decrease learning. Our data suggest that the ability of climbing fibers to induce plasticity can be dynamically gated in vivo, even under conditions where climbing fibers are robustly activated by performance errors."

When the object was moved so that a bigger reflexive eye movement was required to stabilize the image, the activation of the climbing fibres in response to the error led to a change in the response of the Purkinje cells, as expected. However, when a smaller reflexive eye movement was needed, the error-driven responses of the climbing fibres did not alter the responses of Purkinje cells. Similar results were obtained using pulses of light to artificially activate climbing fibres and thus simulate error signals."

Previous work has shown that this process is regulated by a feedback loop from the cerebellar cortex to the inferior olive (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andersson and Armstrong, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hesslow and Ivarsson, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Medina et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Rasmussen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Yang and Lisberger, 2013</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib4\">Apps, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gibson et al., 2002</a>). In this study, we describe a second level of regulation in animals undergoing learning: even when climbing fibers are robustly activated by performance errors, the ability of that climbing fiber activity to trigger plasticity can be regulated by the state of the cerebellar circuit. Thus, the cerebellum is not a slave to its climbing fiber \u2018teachers\u2019, but rather plays an active role in determining whether it will adapt in response to the error signals it receives from the climbing fibers."

Climbing fibers are activated by performance errors during a wide range of motor learning tasks (for a review, see <a href=\"#bib30\">Ito, 2001</a>), and several lines of evidence suggest that this provides a potent trigger for cerebellar plasticity. A single spike in a climbing fiber reliably triggers a complex spike in its Purkinje cell targets (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eccles et al., 1966</a>). Calcium transients associated with complex spikes can induce synaptic plasticity in the cerebellar cortex in vitro (for reviews, see <a href=\"#bib26\">Hansel et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ito, 2001</a>). In vivo, climbing fiber activation can replace the unconditioned stimulus used to induce a form of cerebellum-dependent classical conditioning (<a href=\"#bib56\">Mauk et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Steinmetz et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jirenhed et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Rasmussen et al., 2013</a>) or the sensory feedback used to induce oculomotor learning (<a href=\"#bib64\">Nguyen-Vu et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, during a smooth pursuit oculomotor learning task, there is a tight, trial-by-trial correlation between the occurrence of individual spikes in a climbing fiber and changes in cerebellar output on the subsequent trial, suggesting that climbing fiber spikes provide a potent and reliable trigger for plasticity (<a href=\"#bib59\">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Yang and Lisberger, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib100\">2013</a>)."

In addition, perturbation of the most extensively studied form of climbing fiber-triggered plasticity, long-term depression of the parallel fiber-to-Purkinje cell synapses (pf-Pk LTD), impairs certain learning tasks while leaving other cerebellum-dependent learning tasks intact (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aiba et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boyden et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">De Zeeuw et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Feil et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hansel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Katoh et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Katoh et al, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kim and Thompson, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kishimoto et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kishimoto et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Koekkoek et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Schonewille et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Shibuki et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Shutoh et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib84\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">van Alphen and De Zeeuw, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Welsh et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Yanagihara and Kondo, 1996</a>).

Climbing fiber spikes were originally thought to convey a reliable, invariant, all-or-none signal for plasticity. However, more recently, it has been shown that a Purkinje cell\u2019s response to its climbing fiber input can be graded, which, in turn, can regulate the efficacy of climbing fiber stimulation to induce plasticity in vitro and in decerebrate preparations (<a href=\"#bib96\">Weber et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Carey and Regehr, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Maruta et al, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mathy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Rasmussen et al., 2013</a>). However, to date, there has been no evidence about whether the ability of the error signals carried by climbing fibers to induce learning is also regulated in awake, behaving animals. When climbing fibers are activated by performance errors, does this reliably trigger plasticity, or can the impact of these error signals in the climbing fibers be gated? To address this question, we compared two closely related oculomotor learning paradigms that rely on the same cerebellar microcircuit: learned increases and decreases in the gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; for a review, see <a href=\"#bib8\">Boyden et al., 2004</a>)."

Vestibular signals are also conveyed, via parallel fibers and interneurons, to Purkinje cells in the cerebellar floccular complex. Purkinje cells also receive input from climbing fibers that respond to retinal slip, which indicates a performance error--a failure of eye movements to stabilize a visual image on the retina. Climbing fiber activity is hypothesized to drive plasticity in the other inputs to Purkinje cells. Changes in Purkinje cell output can influence eye movements through their inhibitory effect on VOR interneurons in the vestibular nuclei. An extracellular recording from a Purkinje cell can detect complex spikes, which reflect spikes in its single climbing fiber input with a one-to-one correspondence, and simple spikes (71 \u00b1 9 sp/s, mean \u00b1 SEM), which greatly outnumber complex spikes (0.98 \u00b1 0.19 sp/s) and thus are the major output from the Purkinje cells."

To successfully stabilize images, the gain of the VOR (amplitude of the eye movement response to a vestibular input) needs to be well calibrated. This calibration occurs through a form of motor learning that depends on the cerebellar floccular complex (flocculus and ventral paraflocculus) (<a href=\"#bib78\">Robinson, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ito et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Lisberger et al, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Nagao, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">McElligott et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Rambold et al., 2002</a>). Climbing fibers in this part of the cerebellum are robustly activated by performance errors during both VOR-increase and VOR-decrease learning: if the eye movements driven by the VOR are too small or too big, that performance error results in image motion on the retina (retinal slip), which is encoded by the floccular climbing fibers (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ghelarducci et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Graf et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Simpson and Alley, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Stone and Lisberger, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013F</a>).

Over the course of both VOR-increase and VOR-decrease learning, the Purkinje cell simple spike output during the VOR is altered in a manner consistent with the induction of LTD in parallel fiber inputs that were coactive with the climbing fibers during training (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dufoss\u00e9 et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hirata and Highstein, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lisberger et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Miles et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Nagao, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Watanabe, 1984</a>, <a href=\"#bib95\">1985</a>). Also, direct, optogenetic activation of the climbing fibers can induce VOR-increase learning, when paired with a vestibular stimulus (<a href=\"#bib64\">Nguyen-Vu et al., 2013</a>). On the other hand, a previous attempt to induce VOR-decrease learning with climbing fiber stimulation was unsuccessful (<a href=\"#bib64\">Nguyen-Vu et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, studies of multiple lines of mice deficient in pf-Pk LTD have not consistently found impairments of VOR learning, and the reported impairments are more pronounced for VOR-increase than VOR-decrease learning (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aiba et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boyden et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">De Zeeuw et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Feil et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hansel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kim and Thompson, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Koekkoek et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Schonewille et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">van Alphen and De Zeeuw, 2002</a>). These results raised the possibility that the efficacy of the error signals carried by climbing fibers to induce plasticity is reduced during VOR-decrease training. In this study, we provide convergent evidence for this possibility from recording and stimulation experiments. The regulation of climbing fiber efficacy for inducing plasticity represents a new component of the learning algorithm implemented by the cerebellum."

Retinal slip can induce an adaptive increase or decrease in the gain of the VOR, depending on its direction relative to the vestibular stimulus (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boyden et al., 2004</a>). To induce a learned increase in VOR gain, visual image motion is paired with a vestibular stimulus in the opposite direction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>); to induce a learned decrease in VOR gain, visual image motion is paired with a vestibular stimulus in the same direction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; <a href=\"#bib12a\">Collewijn and Grootendorst, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib93a\">Vercher and Gauthier, 1990\u20131991</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Pastor et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Raymond and Lisberger, 1996</a>).

Climbing fiber-induced plasticity can reduce Purkinje cell simple spike output, either through long-term depression (LTD) at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ito et al., 1982</a>) or through potentiation of inhibitory inputs to the Purkinje cell (<a href=\"#bib34\">J\u00f6rntell and Ekerot, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kano et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Tanaka et al., 2013</a>). The error signals carried by climbing fibers during VOR-increase and VOR-decrease training should trigger reductions in Purkinje cell output during ipsiversive and contraversive vestibular stimuli, respectively. A reduction in Purkinje cell firing during <i>ipsiversive</i> vestibular stimuli would cause VOR interneurons in the vestibular nuclei to receive inhibition from Purkinje cells that is more out-of-phase with the excitatory input they receive from vestibular afferents (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), leading to larger responses in the vestibular nuclei and hence an increase in VOR gain (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ito, 1982</a>). In contrast, a climbing fiber-triggered reduction in Purkinje cell firing during <i>contraversive</i> vestibular stimuli would cause the inhibition from Purkinje cells to be more in-phase with the excitatory vestibular afferents, resulting in smaller responses of vestibular nuclei neurons and a decrease in VOR gain. Such changes in Purkinje cell responses have been reported by several laboratories after VOR learning (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dufoss\u00e9 et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hirata and Highstein, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lisberger et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Miles et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Nagao, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Watanabe, 1984</a>, <a href=\"#bib95\">1985</a>).

The activity of an individual climbing fiber encodes retinal slip in a probabilistic manner (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). Climbing fibers fire at a low rate, and even when retinal slip is present, an individual climbing fiber does not fire on every trial. We harnessed this natural variance to assess whether the activation of the climbing fibers during training is what drives plasticity in the VOR circuit. If a spike in the climbing fiber on one trial induces plasticity in the inputs to its Purkinje cell target, this might be detected as a change in the Purkinje cell\u2019s simple spike response on the next trial, as previously reported during smooth pursuit eye movement learning (<a href=\"#bib59\">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Yang and Lisberger, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib100\">2013</a>).

Likewise, we identified pairs of consecutive trials in which there was no spike in the climbing fiber on either trial (No CF\u2013No CF pairs), and calculated the trial-to-trial change in the simple spike response.

One trivial possibility would be that during contraversive vestibular stimuli there are simply not enough synapses active simultaneously with the climbing fibers to serve as a substrate for associative plasticity. This seems unlikely because there is robust activation of mossy fiber inputs to the cerebellar flocculus during both contraversive and ipsiversive vestibular stimuli (<a href=\"#bib66\">Noda, 1986</a>), and a substantial fraction of Purkinje cells increase their firing in response to contraversive vestibular stimuli (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dufoss\u00e9 et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lisberger and Fuchs, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Miles et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Watanabe, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Nagao, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Pastor et al, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lisberger et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Raymond and Lisberger, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hirata and Highstein, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blazquez et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ke et al., 2009</a>).

However, such correlational evidence cannot, by itself, establish causality, and the relationship between the short-term effects observed in the trial-by-trial analysis and long-term learning has not been established (<a href=\"#bib100\">Yang and Lisberger, 2013</a>). Thus, to provide a causal test of the climbing fiber role in VOR learning, and to analyze climbing fiber-induced plasticity over a longer time scale, we used an optogenetic stimulation approach in mice. We tested whether direct, optogenetic activation of climbing fibers could replace the sensory feedback (visual error signals provided by retinal slip) that normally drives VOR learning, and induce learning when paired with a vestibular stimulus in the absence of any visual feedback. We recently reported preliminary evidence that climbing fiber stimulation can induce VOR-increase but not VOR-decrease learning (<a href=\"#bib64\">Nguyen-Vu et al., 2013</a>). However, the single set of stimulation parameters used in that study was designed to elicit a maximal response, and could potentially have recruited additional plasticity that masked the expression of any climbing fiber contribution to VOR-decrease learning. Moreover, there was no test of whether climbing fiber activation could be initiating changes in the VOR circuit that would support the delayed expression of VOR-decrease learning at later time points beyond the training session, which is plausible given the evidence that different mechanisms can support oculomotor learning over different time scales (<a href=\"#bib92a\">Titley et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Shutoh et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Okamoto et al., 2011</a>).

This pairing was done in total darkness, that is, in the absence of retinal slip, the sensory error signal that normally drives VOR learning. The vestibular stimulus consisted of 1 Hz sinusoidal head rotation. The climbing fiber stimulation was bilateral, with the climbing fibers in the flocculus on each side activated in alternation, using a single, 15-ms pulse of light centered on peak ipsiversive head velocity: climbing fibers in the right flocculus were stimulated during peak rightward head velocity, and climbing fibers in the left flocculus were stimulated during peak leftward head velocity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, red). As a control, the same vestibular stimulus was delivered in the absence of any climbing fiber stimulation during the 30-min training period.

However, the same climbing fiber stimulation protocols were effective at inducing robust and graded learning when timed relative to the vestibular stimulus to mimic VOR-increase training. Moreover, the lack of VOR-decrease learning in response to optogenetic climbing fiber stimulation was consistent with the trial-by-trial analysis, which found no evidence for a contribution of the natural, visually-elicited error signals in the climbing fibers to the induction of VOR-decrease learning. Thus, the stimulation results, together with the trial-by-trial recordings, suggest that VOR-decrease learning is not induced by the climbing fibers, even though they carry error signals that could potentially guide learning, and the very same climbing fibers contribute to the induction of VOR-increase learning."

During VOR-decrease training, the animals are learning (<a href=\"#bib74\">Raymond and Lisberger, 1996</a>), and there are changes in the responses of the Purkinje cells that can be detected within the 90-s training period (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). However, those changes do not seem to be driven by the climbing fibers, because there was no trial-by-trial correlation between climbing fiber activity and changes in Purkinje cell simple spike responses of the kind observed during VOR-increase or smooth pursuit learning (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#bib59\">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</a>). Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of the climbing fibers at the time that they normally fire during VOR-decrease training did not induce VOR-decrease learning (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 7</a>). Thus, in vivo, climbing fiber activity is sometimes a potent trigger for plasticity, but at other times has no effect.

Therefore in the current paper, we paired stimulation experiments with highly complementary recording experiments, which showed that the <i>natural</i> climbing fiber responses present during visual-vestibular VOR-decrease training are not correlated with the induction of plasticity either. The stimulation experiments can demonstrate causality but are inherently \u2018unnatural\u2019.

That study did not rule out a contribution of the climbing fibers to VOR-decrease learning via a mechanism other than pf-Pk LTD, such as rebound potentiation of inhibitory synapses onto the Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kano et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Tanaka et al., 2013</a>) or plasticity in the Purkinje cells\u2019 targets caused by the climbing fiber-triggered pause in Purkinje cell simple spiking (<a href=\"#bib52\">Maiz et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the present results extend our previous work by demonstrating a selective contribution, not only of pf-Pk LTD, but of all climbing fiber-dependent plasticity mechanisms to VOR-increase learning but not VOR-decrease learning. It is not known why the mechanisms for VOR-decrease and VOR-increase learning are different, although one can speculate that this would allow learning to appropriately weight the different \u2018costs\u2019 of having a VOR gain that is too high vs too low. For example, a VOR gain that is too high may be more likely to create eye movement instabilities."

In contrast, direct comparison of the VOR-increase and VOR-decrease paradigms provides a demonstration that the very same animals and even the very same cells could toggle between either a tight coupling or no apparent coupling between climbing fiber activity and the induction of plasticity, depending on the behavioral context of the specific oculomotor training paradigm. Thus, direct comparison of the positive and negative results from VOR-increase and VOR-decrease learning in the same animals and the same cells, using the same techniques, suggests that climbing fiber efficacy is actively regulated."

During both training paradigms, simple spike firing rate decreased relative to the spontaneous, pre-stimulus baseline around the time of climbing fiber activation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This decrease in simple spike rate was smaller during VOR-decrease than VOR-increase training, indicating a higher ratio of excitatory to inhibitory inputs to the Purkinje cells at the time of climbing fiber activity during VOR-decrease vs VOR-increase training.

Horizontal eye position (relative to the head) was measured using the eye coil method (<a href=\"#bib77\">Robinson, 1963</a>) and differentiated to obtain a record of eye velocity. Vestibular stimuli were delivered by rotating the primate chair and animal about an earth\u2013vertical axis using a turntable controlled by a velocity servo motor (Carco Electronics). The vestibular stimulus was a 250-ms, 500-ms, or 1000-ms pulse of head velocity at 15\u00b0/s (25 ms of acceleration). The servo motor had a small overshoot at the end of the acceleration and deceleration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>).

During VOR-increase training, the visual stimulus moved in the opposite direction from the vestibular stimulus at 15\u00b0/s (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). During VOR-decrease training, the visual stimulus moved in the same direction as the vestibular stimulus at 15\u00b0/s (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), so that the visual stimulus moved together with the head. These training stimuli induce a learned increase or decrease in VOR gain after 2\u20133 hr of training (<a href=\"#bib74\">Raymond and Lisberger, 1996</a>). In the current experiments, we wanted to compare the responses of the same neurons to VOR-increase and VOR-decrease training stimuli. Therefore, the training stimuli were not presented for the prolonged training sessions that are typically used to induce learning, but rather the VOR-increase and VOR-decrease training stimuli were alternated in brief, 60\u201390 s blocks, so that the neural responses to the two kinds of training stimuli could be directly compared in the same neurons."

To calculate the probability of a climbing fiber spike, data were binned in 50 ms bins, and the number of spikes within each bin was divided by the total number of trials. To calculate the retinal slip, saccades were first excised and replaced with a linear interpolation of the smooth eye velocity. Segments of data containing saccades that could not be interpolated were removed. Retinal slip (motion of the visual stimulus relative to the eye) was calculated by subtracting the sum of eye velocity (relative to the head) and head velocity (relative to the world) from the visual stimulus velocity (relative to the world). Average climbing fiber spike probability, retinal slip, and simple spike rate were calculated for each cell, and then combined to create a grand average. Simple spike firing rates were calculated using the reciprocal interval method (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lisberger and Pavelko, 1986</a>). Since most Purkinje cells in the sample had some response to saccades, the firing rate was interpolated or excised according to whether the corresponding eye velocity trace was interpolated or excised. Simple spike firing rate was plotted in 10-ms bins in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. To account for slow changes in baseline firing rate, a 10 s moving average baseline was subtracted from simple spike rates in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3\u20135</a>.

Previous studies have reported learning-related changes in the Purkinje cells\u2019 response during the VOR after at least an hour of VOR-increase or -decrease training (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hirata and Highstein, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lisberger et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Raymond and Lisberger, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Watanabe, 1984</a>).

Using linear regression, we fit a slope to this relationship, yielding a rate of change in the Purkinje cell\u2019s response, in units of spikes/s per trial, for each training session. To determine whether overall changes in Purkinje cell activity were significant, the rates of change from all sessions in each learning condition were compared to a null hypothesis of zero using a one sample t-test. We analyzed the first 100 ms of the trial because at that time the eye movement response is driven primarily by the VOR, with little influence of visually-driven eye movements."

The neurons in the inferior olive whose axons form the climbing fibers in the left and right cerebellar flocculus are in the right and left dorsal cap of Kooy, respectively, which lie on either side of the midline (<a href=\"#bib79\">Ruigrok et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Tan et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004</a>). Retinal slip in a given direction drives opposite responses (increases vs decreases in firing) in dorsal cap neurons on opposite sides of the midline. Therefore, to approximate the natural responses of the climbing fibers to retinal slip requires independent control of olivary neurons on either side of the midline, which would be difficult to accomplish using electrical stimulation. The optogenetic approach overcomes this limitation, because ChR2-expressing climbing fibers can be selectively activated on one side of the brain by shining light on their terminals in the cerebellar flocculus."

The optrode was introduced via the implanted cannula. For some physiological recordings, the mouse was initially anesthetized using isoflurane or ketamine and then allowed to recover for the recordings. Purkinje cell activity was sampled at 50 KHz using Spike 2 (CED), and sorted off-line (Spike 2). Climbing fibers were activated using the same optical stimulation parameters that were used in the behavioral, optogenetic training experiments (see below). An electrophysiological waveform artifact due to the light pulse was observed in some recordings. To isolate the waveform artifact, the optrode was moved until the activity of the cell that was being recorded disappeared, and the same light stimulus trains were then delivered. This isolated waveform of the artifact was subtracted from the electrophysiological traces to identify the complex spike response to the light pulse."

Vestibular stimuli were delivered by rotating the whole body about an earth\u2013vertical axis using a 1 Hz sinusoidal velocity profile (\u00b110\u00b0/s peak velocity). To stimulate the climbing fibers in the flocculus, a 200-\u03bcm optical fiber (Thor Labs) was introduced through the cannula implanted above the cerebellar flocculus. To optimize the position of the optical fiber for the most effective activation of the climbing fibers, a 20-Hz train of 2 ms light pulses was delivered for 3 s at different depths. When positioned near climbing fibers expressing ChR2, the high frequency stimulation induced a nystagmus similar to what was previously described when the inferior olive was electrically stimulated (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barmack and Hess, 1980</a>). The optical fiber was placed at the depth at which the largest eye movements were induced. After several minutes of \u2018rest\u2019 time, a single light pulse, or a 250-ms train of three light pulses with a 125 ms inter-pulse-interval (473 nm light, 15 ms pulse duration, 1\u20132 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was repeated every second and centered on peak ipsiversive or contraversive vestibular stimulus speed, to roughly mimic the climbing fiber responses during VOR-increase or VOR-decrease training, respectively. Stimulation was delivered bilaterally, with stimulation of climbing fibers in the two cerebellar hemispheres 180\u00b0 out of phase. In a separate cohort of mice, a 250-ms train of three light pulses with a 125-ms inter-pulse-interval (2, 10 or 15 ms pulse duration, 0.3\u20131 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was delivered unilaterally. As a control, the same experiments were performed without climbing fiber stimulation during the training blocks (\u2018vestibular only\u2019 condition). In a \u2018climbing fiber only\u2019 training condition, climbing fibers were stimulated bilaterally or unilaterally with the train of three light pulses used in optogenetic training. The effects of unilateral or bilateral climbing fiber only stimulation were not significantly different, and were therefore pooled (p=0.21, unpaired <i>t</i>-test; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, light grey)."

There were at least 48 hr between tests of the different training conditions. After the optogenetic training experiments were conducted, we tested the ability of the mice to undergo a learned decrease and increase in VOR gain in response to a more typical VOR training paradigm, which paired the vestibular stimulus with a visual stimulus. For visually-induced VOR-decrease or VOR-increase training, the vestibular stimulus (1 Hz, \u00b110\u00b0/s peak velocity) was paired with a visual stimulus that moved exactly with or exactly opposite the head, respectively. The visual stimulus was provided by a back-lit optokinetic drum with black and white stripes, each subtending approximately 7.5\u00b0 of visual angle."

Custom software was used for data analysis (Mathworks, Inc.). To calculate eye velocity, the eye position was first low-pass filtered using a third-order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 9 Hz, and then differentiated. Eye velocity data were edited to remove saccades and any body movement artifacts using a velocity threshold. Eye and head velocity data were fit with sine waves. VOR gain was calculated by dividing the amplitude of the eye velocity fit by the amplitude of the head velocity fit. Learning was calculated as the percent change in VOR gain relative to the pre-training baseline, that is, a 0% change would indicate no learning. The normality of the distribution of VOR gain changes for each training condition at each time point of interest was tested using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test (Graphpad Prism). For statistical analyses that included at least one set of data with a non-normal distribution, non-parametric tests were used. For the experiments that used single pulses of climbing fiber stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), a repeated measures two-way ANOVA, with training condition and time as factors, was performed (Statview) to test whether climbing fiber stimulation induced changes in VOR gain. To determine which training conditions were significantly different from each other, a Fisher\u2019s post-hoc test was performed. To test whether a change in VOR gain was significantly different from pre-training baseline (i.e., from zero) immediately or 2 hr post-training, a one sample t-test (parametric) or a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test (non-parametric) was performed for each training condition (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). To test whether training paradigms that used different amounts of climbing fiber stimulation had different effects, immediately or 2 hr after training (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), a one-way ANOVA (parametric) or Kruskal\u2013Wallis test (non-parametric) was performed, with training condition (bilateral CF 3x, unilateral CF 3x, bilateral CF 1x and vestibular only) as the factor (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). When appropriate, a Dunnett\u2019s (parametric) or Dunn\u2019s (non-parametric) multiple comparisons test was performed to compare each optogenetic training paradigm to the vestibular only control (Graphpad Prism). This analysis was conducted separately for the pairing of optogenetic stimulation with an ipsiversive vs contraversive vestibular stimulus. To test whether the visually induced learned decreases in the gain of the VOR were different from the changes induced by the vestibular only training, an unpaired t-test was performed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). To compare the effects of stimulating the climbing fibers during the ipsiversive vs contraversive phase of the vestibular stimulus, an unpaired t-test (parametric) or Mann\u2013Whitney test (non-parametric) was performed on the changes in VOR gain measured immediately or 2 hr post-training (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

One of the reviewers expressed serious reservations about these shortcomings. It is important that more focus on the novel aspects of the paper is needed. In addition, the authors should either eliminate some of the less compelling aspects of the paper or fill in the dots as to why they are important and related to the big story. Some more specific comments are provided next."

In contrast to that paper, the present manuscript does not provide an in depth study of trial-by-trial learning. Although there is speculation about the relationship between trial-by-trial learning and long-term learning, it is not known if these phenomena are related in any way. A clear distinction and comparison is necessary. The differences between pursuit versus VOR should also be discussed."

Hesslow et al. Gibson et al.), for instance because of the nucleo-olivary pathway. When using the term \u201cgating\u201d (as in gating in the olive or gating pain signals) one would normally suggest that it is a design principle of a circuit that a signal with a particular function is sometimes allowed, sometimes not, to fulfil that function. When A causes B only when it occurs together with C, we do not usually say that C is a gating mechanism. In the reviewers' view, the authors seem to suggest something stronger than what they have demonstrated. When it comes to the speculations about what the missing factor might be, I think that a word or two about how the mossy fiber input might differ between the two experimental situations might be justified."

The Marr-Albus-Ito model of cerebellar learning suggests that a performance error elicits a response in the climbing fibers, which triggers plasticity. Previous studies have provided evidence that the ability of error-related cues to drive spiking in the climbing fibers can be regulated by the state of the cerebellar circuit during training (<a href=\"#bib100\">Yang and Lisberger, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Rasmussen, Jirenhed and Hesslow, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hesslow and Ivarsson, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Andersson &amp; Armstrong 1987</a>; reviewed in Apps et al. 1999 and ; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gibson et al. 2002</a>). Our paper shows another level of regulation \u2013 even when there is a robust response in the climbing fibers, its ability to trigger plasticity can also be regulated by the state of the cerebellar circuit. Related phenomena have been described in vitro (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carey and Regehr 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mathy et al. 2009</a>); our paper is the first to show that this regulation can occur in intact animals undergoing learning. Thus, the cerebellum is not a slave to its climbing fiber \u2018teachers,\u2019 but plays an active role in determining whether it will adapt in response to the error signals it receives from the climbing fibers, with multiple stages of regulation."

Those papers reported that a single complex spike in a Purkinje cell, reflecting a spike in its climbing fiber input, reliably triggers plasticity that can be detected on the next trial during smooth pursuit learning. In striking contrast to those papers, we found a clear dissociation between the complex spikes and the induction of plasticity during VOR-decrease learning. Because the experiments were all done in rhesus monkeys, this difference, which is central to our conclusions, cannot be attributed to a species difference."

The previous analyses of smooth pursuit learning (and our analysis of VOR-increase learning) all found a consistent, trial-by-trial correlation between spikes in a climbing fiber and the induction of plasticity, consistent with the classic, Marr-Albus-Ito model of cerebellar learning. In striking contrast, our results from VOR-decrease learning show that there are conditions where there are robust error signals and spiking in the climbing fibers, but there is no induction of plasticity that can be detected on the next trial. This latter observation supports our novel conclusion that the ability of the climbing fibers to induce plasticity can be gated downstream of spikes in the climbing fibers.

That study left open the possibility that the robust error signals carried by the climbing fibers during VOR-decrease training might contribute to VOR-decrease learning through a mechanism other than pf-Pk LTD, such as rebound potentiation of the inhibitory synapses onto the Purkinje cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kano et al. 1992</a>; Tanaka et al. 2013) or plasticity in the vestibular nuclei induced by the climbing fiber-triggered pause in simple spiking (<a href=\"#bib52\">Maiz et al. 2012</a>). Our current manuscript assesses the contribution, not only of pf-Pk LTD, but the net effect of all climbing fiber-dependent plasticity mechanisms, and finds a selective contribution to VOR- increase learning, but not VOR-decrease learning, despite the equally robust responses in the climbing fibers during both paradigms."

In order to demonstrate that Purkinje cell simple spike activity triggers plasticity via a mechanism distinct from that triggered by climbing fiber activity, we also included in that paper a few control experiments using optogenetic stimulation of the climbing fibers. The conclusion we drew from those experiments was that climbing fiber activation and Purkinje cell activation could not substitute for each other. Those experiments provided a hint that climbing fiber activation does not drive VOR-decrease learning; however, the data were not sufficient to make that conclusion. Most importantly, the climbing fiber stimulation might have failed to induce VOR-decrease learning simply because it failed to adequately mimic the natural patterns of climbing fiber activation present during normal VOR-decrease learning. Therefore in the current manuscript, we pair the stimulation experiments with highly complementary recording experiments, which show that the <i>natural</i> climbing fiber responses present during visual-vestibular VOR- decrease training are not correlated with the induction of plasticity either. Each approach has its strengths and limitations \u2013 the stimulation experiments can establish causality but are inherently \u201cunnatural\u201d, whereas the recording experiments document what happens under more natural conditions, but can only show correlations, which does not necessarily mean there is a causal relationship. Together the convergent evidence from the stimulation and recording experiments are considerably more powerful than either alone, and thus the combination of the two is an important contribution of the current manuscript. In addition, the current manuscript improves upon the stimulation approach by comparing multiple climbing fiber stimulation protocols and by testing whether climbing fiber stimulation might be initiating changes in the VOR circuit that would support the delayed expression of VOR-decrease learning, which does not appear to be the case."
