Here, we present two high-resolution structures of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> XerH with its recombination site DNA <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>, representing pre-cleavage and post-cleavage synaptic intermediates in the recombination pathway. The structures reveal that activation of DNA strand cleavage and rejoining involves large conformational changes and DNA bending, suggesting how interaction with the cell division protein FtsK may license recombination at the septum. Together with biochemical and in vivo analysis, our structures also reveal how a small sequence asymmetry in <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> defines protein conformation in the synaptic complex and orchestrates the order of DNA strand exchanges. Our results provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of Xer recombination and a model for regulation of recombination activity during cell division."

Here, we present two high-resolution structures of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> XerH with its recombination site DNA <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>, representing pre-cleavage and post-cleavage synaptic intermediates in the recombination pathway. The structures reveal that activation of DNA strand cleavage and rejoining involves large conformational changes and DNA bending, suggesting how interaction with the cell division protein FtsK may license recombination at the septum. Together with biochemical and in vivo analysis, our structures also reveal how a small sequence asymmetry in <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> defines protein conformation in the synaptic complex and orchestrates the order of DNA strand exchanges. Our results provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of Xer recombination and a model for regulation of recombination activity during cell division."

Structures of the enzyme before and after it cut the DNA show that Xer-DNA complexes first assemble in an inactive state and are then activated by large conformational changes that make the DNA bend.

Dimer formation prohibits proper segregation of the genetic information at cell division (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and must be repaired to produce viable progeny. In bacteria and archaea, chromosome dimers are monomerized by members of a large family of tyrosine recombinases, the Xer recombinases (<a href=\"#bib9\">Blakely et al., 1991</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">1993</a>). These enzymes act by promoting recombination between two DNA sites, called <i>dif</i>. The <i>dif</i> site is normally present in a single copy at the replication terminus (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carnoy and Roten, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kuempel et al., 1991</a>), but it is duplicated in chromosome dimers, so that intramolecular recombination results in separation (\u2018resolution\u2019) of\u00a0the two chromosome copies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Two recombinase monomers (beige ovals) bind one specific DNA site (grey) and two such sites are aligned in antiparallel in a tetrameric synaptic complex (<b>i</b>).

The latter then attacks the phosphotyrosyl bond of the partner DNA, forming the HJ intermediate (<b>iii</b>). Following an isomerization step, the second pair of protomers becomes catalytically active (<b>iv</b>), leading to a reciprocal set of cleavage and strand exchange reactions that resolve the HJ and generate the recombined DNA products (<b>v\u2013vi</b>).

Remarkably, the overall shape and DNA conformation of initially formed XerH-<i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> synaptic complexes is considerably different from those of other tyrosine recombinases, such as Cre-<i>loxP</i> that has served as a model system for the family. The unanticipated conformation of the pre-cleavage synaptic complex suggests a possible model for why Xer proteins require external activation, and in comparison with the post-cleavage complex structure provides clues for how FtsK might stimulate recombination activity.

This model proposes a step-wise process that starts with two Xer monomers binding to each <i>dif</i> site, which then interact to form a synaptic complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B, i</a>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Blakely et al., 1993</a>). Here, two Xer protomers each cleave one strand of one <i>dif</i> site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B ii</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Blakely et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gopaul and Duyne, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Guo et al., 1997</a>), and the broken strands are exchanged and rejoined creating the HJ intermediate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B, iii</a>) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gopaul et al., 1998</a>). Then the second Xer pair performs cleavage and strand exchange on the other strand pair, completing recombination (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B, v\u2013vi</a>). Based on available synaptic complex structures of other tyrosine recombinases, it was hypothesized that the <i>dif</i> DNA is bent upon synapsis, creating a square planar DNA arrangement that is then maintained throughout the recombination reaction to allow energetically inexpensive exchange of DNA strands (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gopaul et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Guo et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">1999</a>). However, in the absence of direct structural data the exact architecture of Xer-DNA complexes has remained unknown. Previous DNA-free crystal structures of Xer recombinases (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jo et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Serre et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Subramanya et al., 1997</a>) showed a domain arrangement that is incompatible with DNA binding. Another puzzling aspect of the mechanism concerned activation by FtsK. In early work, it was noted that in the absence of <i>E. coli</i> FtsK, HJ formation was catalysed by XerC, leading to the hypothesis that XerC/D-<i>dif</i> synaptic complexes assemble preferentially with XerC in an active conformation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barre et al., 2000</a>). Subsequently, FtsK was shown to interact directly with the C-terminal domain of XerD (<a href=\"#bib36\">Keller et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yates et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib70\">2006</a>), and this interaction was hypothesized to promote reassembly of the \u2018XerC-active\u2019 synaptic complex into a conformation in which XerD is active and performs cleavage of the first DNA strand pair (<a href=\"#bib5\">Aussel et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Grainge et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zawadzki et al., 2013</a>). More recently, single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) studies indicated that the majority of XerC/D-<i>dif</i> synaptic complexes formed in the absence of FtsK are in a conformation where XerD is catalytically inactive, but ready for direct activation by FtsK without major dis- and reassembly of the complex (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zawadzki et al., 2013</a>). A small proportion of XerC active complexes nevertheless form and create unproductive HJs, but the pre-active XerD synaptic complexes are dominant and are the ones activated by FtsK. However, none of the previous structures or biochemical data have provided an explanation for why Xer recombinases require activation, or what the nature of the proposed conformational rearrangements might be."

We confirmed XerH binding to <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> by DNase I footprinting (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We then co-crystallized full-length wild-type XerH with a 30 bp <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> DNA duplex. The resulting 2.1 \u00c5 resolution structure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) shows a synaptic complex with two <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> molecules and four XerH subunits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, left panel). Each <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> site interacts with two XerH molecules, one molecule (molecule A) binding to the left arm and one (molecule B) to the right arm. The complex has overall two-fold symmetry relating the two DNA molecules and the XerH molecules bound to them (i.e. molecules A and B to A\u2019 and B\u2019; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The overall fold of each protein subunit resembles that of other tyrosine recombinases, comprising two mostly helical domains connected by a 7-aa linker (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Notably, the C-terminal helix \u03b1O protrudes from the body of each catalytic domain into a cleft on the surface of an adjacent subunit in a cyclic fashion, creating a cyclic domain-swapped arrangement similar to the ones observed in the structures of Cre (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, right panel) and \u03bb integrase synaptic complexes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Biswas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Guo et al., 1997</a>)."

The N-terminal domain contacts the DNA using a four-helix bundle (\u03b1A-\u03b1D, aa 12\u201388) and helix \u03b1F, both of which insert into the major groove (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These protein segments contribute most of the sequence-specific interactions to the DNA bases, while the catalytic domain contacts mainly the DNA backbone (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). Many interactions of the catalytic domain involve helix \u03b1K (aa 285\u2013299) that is inserted into the major groove at the outer part of <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>, narrows the groove (17 \u00c5 as opposed to 22 \u00c5 in typical B-DNA) and induces a slight DNA bend (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

These substrates contain a nick in the DNA backbone of each strand, one nucleotide downstream of the cleavage position. Upon XerH-mediated cleavage, the resulting covalent XerH-<i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> intermediate is trapped and can be detected by SDS-PAGE (see also <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). As predicted by the structure, mutations of the inner base-pairs of the arms (where XerH makes base-specific contacts) resulted in abolished or greatly reduced cleavage activity, whereas mutations of the neighboring base-pairs did not affect the\u00a0activity."

(<b>E</b>) Left arm is required for XerH-mediated recombination in <i>E. coli</i>. Intramolecular recombination rates were measured with plasmids containing two <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> sites (WT+WT), one <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> site and one <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>LP site (WT+LP), two <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>LP sites (LP+LP), one <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> site and one <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>RP site (WT+RP), two <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>RP sites (RP+RP), two <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> sites with G3 and T4 mutated to CA, or two <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> sites with G3 and T4 mutated to CC. G3 was mutated together with T4, because it may interact with K290 and complement the role of T4. XerH catalytic mutant R213K XerH is shown as a control.

In several studied examples, this ordering is believed to be linked to asymmetry in the DNA sequences, but the exact mechanisms vary (<a href=\"#bib10\">Blakely et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ennifar et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nolivos et al., 2010</a>). To determine how the XerH-<i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> system achieves ordering of the recombination steps, we first tested the roles of the two distinct protein-binding arms of <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) in XerH binding and activity. DNA binding assays (EMSA) with substrates containing the sequences of one or both arms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) showed that two XerH monomers bind cooperatively (see especially <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The affinity of a <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>L substrate containing only the left arm sequence, with a random sequence in place of the right arm, was higher (dissociation constant, K<sub>D</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0180 nM; similar to wild-type <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> K<sub>D</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0150 nM) than the affinity of a similar right arm-containing substrate <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>R (K<sub>D</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0230 nM). Similarly, a palindromic substrate containing two <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> left arms (<i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>LP) made a stable complex with XerH (observed by SEC), whereas the equivalent right arm substrate (<i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>RP) did not (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). DNA cleavage assays also revealed different efficiencies at the two arms: no cleavage product was detected with <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>R or <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>RP, whereas <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>L and <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>LP substrates were cleaved as efficiently as the native <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> site (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C and D</a>). An assay that assesses the efficiency of intramolecular recombination between two plasmid-borne sites in <i>E. coli</i> also indicated differential activity at the two <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> arms in vivo: the wild-type recombination rate (9.9% recombination-positive colonies) increased when both <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> sites were replaced with <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>LP (29.4%; p=0.0016, t-test), but decreased to barely detectable levels with <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>RP (1.3%; p=0.0021, t-test) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

Remarkably, the sequences of the two arms are identical apart from a single base-pair insertion in the left arm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In the crystal structure, the respective XerH subunits (A and B) make very similar interactions with the two <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> arms (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). The inserted base-pair (A6/T25\u2019, brown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) is not recognized directly. Instead, the main difference in the recognition of the two arms involves a conserved thymine base (T4/T5') in the outer parts of the arms: In the left arm, T4 forms hydrophobic contacts with XerH \u03b1K and makes a specific hydrogen bond with lysine K290 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, red insert), whereas in the right arm T5' is closer to the center of <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> and cannot make these interactions. Surprisingly, the three outermost base-pairs of each <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> arm make very similar backbone interactions with their respective XerH subunits, despite the fact that they are shifted in space due to the insertion in the left arm (altering the \u2018helical phase\u2019 of the sequence by\u00a0~35\u00b0; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, black insert; <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). This is possible because the conformation of the DNA is asymmetric \u2013 the left arm is more bent than the right arm \u2013 and the catalytic domains of the protein subunits are rotated by\u00a0~10\u00b0 relative to each other (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Together, the observed differences result in stronger interaction of XerH with the left <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> arm (\u0394G\u00a0=\u00a0\u221221.3 kcal/mol, estimated by PISA [<a href=\"#bib39\">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</a>]) than with the right arm (\u0394G\u00a0=\u00a0\u221215.4 kcal/mol). A further difference between the XerH subunits bound to the left and right arms of <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> concerns the C-terminal helices. While the \u03b1N-\u03b1O segment of molecule A is fully ordered, the linker and \u03b1O are partially disordered in molecule B. Also, helices \u03b1O point in different directions (~100\u00b0 rotation; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>)."

Each <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>LP site interacts with two XerH molecules in a tetrameric synaptic complex, but in this structure, the two halves of the tetramer are related by crystallographic two-fold symmetry (relating molecule A to A\u2019 and B to B\u2019; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). While the structures of the individual XerH subunits and their interactions with the respective <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> DNA arms in this structure and in the pre-cleavage structure are similar, the overall arrangement of the complex is different. Most strikingly, the <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> DNA is now strongly bent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The bend mainly originates from a single distortion within the central region of <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>: bases A17\u2019 and G18\u2019 are un-stacked with a 90\u00b0 tilt, which introduces a kink resulting in asymmetric bending of the DNA (insert in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The total angle of 120\u00b0 between the <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> arms is only slightly wider than the angles observed in previous structures of various tyrosine recombinases (e.g. 109\u00b0 in the post-cleavage structure of \u03bb integrase (<a href=\"#bib8\">Biswas et al., 2005</a>) and 100\u00b0 in Cre-<i>loxP</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guo et al., 1997</a>); see also <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Notably, the kink in <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> is at an equivalent position to the kink in <i>loxP</i> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ennifar et al., 2003</a>). However, whereas in Cre the nucleotides involved in the kink interact with three arginines within a tight pocket (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ennifar et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Guo et al., 1997</a>), XerH forms only a single interaction with these nucleotides (R129-A17\u2019; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>) and encircles the kink less tightly. Notably, the nucleotides of the central region of <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> remain fully base-paired after cleavage, unlike the analogous structure of Cre-<i>loxP</i>, where several of these are unpaired (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guo et al., 1997</a>). The extensive Cre contacts can thus actively bend <i>loxP</i>. In contrast, weaker XerH-<i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> interactions appear to be insufficient to promote sharp DNA bending, but nicks in both DNA strands of the <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> substrate facilitate bending. When we tried to re-build the DNA strands in the post-cleavage structure to model a bent but un-nicked substrate, we observed a clash with the protein near the tyrosine nucleophile-bearing helix \u03b1N, suggesting that the nicks might favor the XerH conformation adopted on the bent sites."

Also, the synaptic interface is considerably larger (3926 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, calculated by PISA [<a href=\"#bib39\">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</a>]) than in the pre-cleavage structure (3040 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>). The previously disordered parts of the \u03b1O helices of molecule B are now fully visible, ordered, and more compact (F338 - W359 distance reduced from 43 \u00c5 to 34 \u00c5; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, left insert). At the same time, helices \u03b1N and \u03b1O of molecule A are rotated by\u00a0~30\u00b0, bringing the catalytic Y344 to a suitable position to attack one strand on each <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>LP DNA forming a covalent phosphotyrosyl bond (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, left)."

Their overall structures are similar (r.m.s. deviation 0.78 \u00c5 for C\u03b1 carbons), but important protein segments that contain catalytic residues (the \u03b22-\u03b23 turn with K239, and \u03b1N-\u03b1O carrying Y344) are in different conformations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Consequently, subunit A assumes a fully active conformation, while subunit B is in an inactive conformation with the catalytic tyrosine distant from the scissile phosphate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). This simultaneous presence of both active and inactive XerH subunit conformations within the synaptic complex is consistent with the \u2018half-of-the-sites reactivity\u2019 mechanism observed for other tyrosine recombinases (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The marked difference between the XerH subunits bound to the two <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>LP arms (comparable to the asymmetry seen in the pre-cleavage complex with native <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i>) is particularly striking considering that the artificially introduced symmetry of the substrate could be expected to mask some asymmetric features of the synaptic complex. The asymmetry is presumably an intrinsic property of the system, essential to the mechanism of synapsis and catalysis."

The five conserved catalytic residues (RHRHY) assemble around the catalytic pocket in all XerC and XerD subunits (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In the post-cleavage complex, the XerD subunits are in an active conformation, with their nucleophilic tyrosines approaching the scissile phosphates, whereas the XerC subunits are in an inactive conformation. As in the XerH structures, the three outer base-pairs of each <i>dif</i> arm are contacted extensively by the proteins (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and the bases corresponding to T4 in <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> interact with lysine K222 of XerC or histidine H225 of XerD, both counterparts of XerH K290 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These interactions might contribute to the arm specificity of XerC and XerD, as well as to ordering recombination, as we inferred for XerH.

This suggests that the XerC/D and XerH complexes might undergo similar conformational rearrangements upon activation. In agreement with this idea, two previous smFRET studies (<a href=\"#bib19\">Diagne et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zawadzki et al., 2013</a>) reported that pre-formed XerC/D-<i>dif</i> synaptic complexes undergo conformational change upon activation by FtsK, leading to an increase of the distance between the two <i>dif</i> termini from about 53 to 67 \u00c5 across the synapse (as predicted from a change in FRET efficiencies; [<a href=\"#bib71\">Zawadzki et al., 2013</a>]).

These structures demonstrate that Xer proteins follow the established chemical pathway of tyrosine recombinases and reveal how the reaction steps can be choreographed by small differences in the arms of the <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> recombination sites. Together with associated biochemical data, the structures also show that XerH-<i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> synaptic complexes initially assemble in an inactive state with straight DNA, which must undergo a major conformational change for catalytic activation, as previously observed in single molecule fluorescence studies of XerC/D-<i>dif</i> recombination (<a href=\"#bib19\">Diagne et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Zawadzki et al., 2013</a>). Our post-cleavage XerH-<i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> synaptic complex structure elucidates the structural nature of this conformational change, which involves major rearrangement of the protein-protein interfaces and DNA bending (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). With molecular modeling, we extend our structural and mechanistic findings to the prototypical <i>E. coli</i> XerC/D-<i>dif</i> system, demonstrating that our structures provide a resource for understanding the mechanism of other Xer recombinases."

Correspondingly, we were unable to observe <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> recombination or XerH-mediated cleavage of intact <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> DNA substrates in vitro (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and data not shown). We cannot exclude the possibility that XerH does still catalyze transient strand cleavage of these substrates, followed by rapid efficient re-ligation making cleavage undetectable, but there is no evidence to support this idea. In contrast, nicked <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> suicide substrates are cleaved efficiently, and our crystal structure in which XerH-mediated cleavage of nicked <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> has occurred showed a sharply bent DNA conformation, consistent with a direct link between DNA bending and cleavage activity. The crystals giving our two structures were grown under different conditions (see Materials and methods), but XerH was active (on nicked <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> substrates) in both conditions (data not shown), supporting our view that both structures are biologically relevant. We hypothesize that our in vitro systems lack a stimulatory factor that is required for normal recombination between intact <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> sites. Septum-borne FtsK was shown to be required for XerH recombination in <i>H. pylori</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Debowski et al., 2012a</a>), so we propose that this is the missing factor for XerH activation in vitro. FtsK-promoted rearrangement of the XerH-<i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> synaptic complex might bring the catalytic tyrosines of the left arm-bound subunits into their active positions close to the scissile phosphates and sharply bend the DNA as seen in our structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6C</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Another possibility is that FtsK mediates formation of a different synaptic complex with the right arm-bound subunits activated for cleavage. However, this would be inconsistent with smFRET studies of XerC/D complexes showing that FtsK activates pre-formed synaptic complexes without major remodeling (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zawadzki et al., 2013</a>). Analogy with the XerC/D system suggests that FtsK might directly interact with the C-terminal\u00a0~20 amino acids of XerH (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yates et al., 2006</a>) or the back of its C-terminal domain (<a href=\"#bib36\">Keller et al., 2016</a>). However, the role of FtsK in the <i>H. pylori</i> Xer system still requires further substantial investigation, and it remains possible that the bent-DNA configuration required for DNA cleavage can be reached from the pre-cleavage structure without the intervention of FtsK."

In most of these cases, DNA bending and the downstream function are performed by the same protein or complex, or DNA bending depends on ubiquitously available factors such as IHF. For tyrosine recombinases, the paradigm suggests that sharp DNA bending that is required for DNA cleavage and energetically inexpensive strand exchange, is introduced by the recombinase itself concomitant with DNA binding and synapsis. Here, we show that this is not the case for XerH, which binds and assembles its recombination substrates in an almost straight conformation.

Upon XerH expression, recombination between the two <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> sites leads to loss of <i>galK.</i> After overnight growth the plates were scraped to resuspend the cells in 1 ml of LB, and an overnight culture was set up with 1 \u03bcl of the scraped cells. <i>E. coli</i> DS941 cells were transformed with the plasmid DNA extracted from the overnight cultures, and the cells were plated again on MacConkey agar supplemented with 1% (w/v) galactose and 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin. Red (indicating no recombination) and white (indicating recombination deleting the <i>galK</i> gene from the plasmid) colonies were counted and recombination efficiency was calculated as the number of white colonies divided by the total number of colonies. Representative plasmids from white colonies were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequencing to confirm that reciprocal recombination between <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> sites had occurred as predicted."

Another reviewer mentioned that the structures of the pre-cleavage (and catalytically inactive) and post-cleavage (on a nicked 'suicide' substrate) synaptic complexes are important and provide some surprises, but that their mechanistic significance is more incremental, with the final model (at least as depicted) adding little to what has been published previously."

In the Abstract for example, the statement that the work will \"open up new avenues towards the antibacterial treatment\" is far-fetched. The same applies to the statement (in the Abstract and elsewhere) that the work provides mechanistic insight into the action of FtsK in stimulating the reaction. Similar overreach is present in the Discussion. In general, statements relating to how FtsK activates Helicobacter Xer recombination or how the present study will aid drug discovery should be downplayed, as there are no direct experiments or data that relate to these points. Relevant to the FtsK, would it be appropriate to bring up and cite the subsequent Zawadzki work (May et al. 2015) on FtsK activation as monitored in single-molecule FRET."

If it is FtsK-dependent, is this expected given the differences between Helicobacter FtsK and <i>E. coli</i> FtsK (and would one expect Helicobacter Xer to be acted on by <i>E. coli</i> FtsK, if indeed this is the case?).

How can this be? The observed affinities for the two dif arms are presumably determined by the relative off-rates, meaning that the left site is more often occupied than the right site, and leading to the second molecule binding to the right site more often than vice versa. Why not simply restate this way? Along these lines, a substantial part of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> is a repeat of what is in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>.

By analogy, XerH bound to the left half-site of dif resembles XerC in its properties (i.e., the more active half). The authors have made the opposite assignment in their model of XerC/XerD/dif shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, which is consistent with current views that XerD catalyzes the first strand exchange when activated by FtsK. However, this assignment implicitly assigns XerD half to be the more active one, based on the data presented. The synaptic complex structure determined in this work might instead correspond to the alternative 'XerC cleavage' synaptic complex: the one that undergoes futile cycling. The reaction schematic shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> implies that the more reactive dif half-sites initiate strand exchange (with the help of FtsK) and the inactive half-sites resolve the HJ intermediate, based on the structural models and biochemistry presented. This is the opposite of the currently favored mechanism for <i>E. coli</i> Xer/dif recombination. Please comment on this point."

This has been a tricky issue in the field, since it is hard to distinguish cleavage followed by rapid ligation from lack of cleavage. Unless the authors can provide data (e.g., using 5'-bridging phosphorothiolates) that demonstrate lack of cleavage, it would be better to take the position that it is not yet clear whether cleavage occurs in vitro. It is also difficult to explain activity in <i>E. coli</i> with such a model. In contrast, the behavior is readily explained if XerH bound to the left end behaves like XerC (as in an alternative model). Related to this is the question of whether cleavage is required for stabilization of the synaptic complex, independent of FtsK. This is true of \u03bb int and several catalytic Cre mutants form much weaker synaptic complexes relative to wild-type Cre, suggesting that this could also be true in XerH as well. The nicked XerH/DNA complex also supports this idea. Thus, the synaptic complex structure observed for XerH could equally well represent a stable intermediate that can reach the transient bent configuration required for cleavage on its own. Please resolve/comment on this issue."

In the absence of FtsK, HJs formed by XerC were detected in early work and this led to the hypothesis that the XerC active conformation formed preferentially and FtsK switched the conformation of an XerC active complex to one in which XerD was active. Single-molecule FRET experiments by Zawadzki and colleagues led to the different hypothesis that this is not the case; rather, the major synaptic complex that forms in the absence of FtsK is an 'XerD potentially active conformation,' which is catalytically dead. A small proportion of XerC active complexes nevertheless form and are responsible for the XerC HJs. Nevertheless, the dominant pre-active XerD synaptic complexes are the ones activated by XerD.

Instead, our results indicate that while first XerH cleavage preferentially occurs on the left arm, resolution of a Holliday Junction substrate (mentioned in the Discussion section as \u201cdata not shown\u201d) occurs by cleavage of the right <i>dif<sub>H</sub></i> arm. Drawing analogy with the XerC/D-<i>dif</i> system, this observation would map XerC to the XerH subunit bound to the right arm (because it is XerC that resolves preformed HJ substrates with or without FtsK), and thus XerD to the left arm-bound subunit. This, together with the observed lack of cleavage on native (un-nicked) substrates (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicates that XerH might not be affected by futile cycling. Instead, XerH synaptic complexes appear to assemble directly in the correct configuration, but normally remain inactive in the absence of FtsK. Introduction of nicks in the DNA substrates might mimic the effect of FtsK, allowing activation of left arm cleavage as seen in our cleavage assays and the post-cleavage structure."

The current text is incomplete and in part misleading. In the absence of FtsK, HJs formed by XerC were detected in early work and this led to the hypothesis that the XerC active conformation formed preferentially and FtsK switched the conformation of an XerC active complex to one in which XerD was active. Single-molecule FRET experiments by Zawadzki and colleagues led to the different hypothesis that this is not the case; rather, the major synaptic complex that forms in the absence of FtsK is an 'XerD potentially active conformation,' which is catalytically dead. A small proportion of XerC active complexes nevertheless form and are responsible for the XerC HJs. Nevertheless, the dominant pre-active XerD synaptic complexes are the ones activated by XerD. This is consistent with the results here, but the historical development of these ideas should be explicitly chronicled.</i>"
