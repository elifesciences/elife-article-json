Here we use an integrated systems-level examination of transcription, translation, and proteolysis to understand these events central to cancer treatment. As a model we study myeloma cells exposed to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a first-line therapy. Despite robust transcriptional changes, unbiased quantitative proteomics detects production of only a few critical anti-apoptotic proteins against a background of general translation inhibition. Simultaneous ribosome profiling further reveals potential translational regulation of stress response genes. Once the apoptotic machinery is engaged, degradation by caspases is largely independent of upstream bortezomib effects. Moreover, previously uncharacterized non-caspase proteolytic events also participate in cellular deconstruction. Our systems-level data also support co-targeting the anti-apoptotic regulator HSF1 to promote cell death by bortezomib. This integrated approach offers unique, in-depth insight into apoptotic dynamics that may prove important to preclinical evaluation of any anti-cancer compound."

Here we use an integrated systems-level examination of transcription, translation, and proteolysis to understand these events central to cancer treatment. As a model we study myeloma cells exposed to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a first-line therapy. Despite robust transcriptional changes, unbiased quantitative proteomics detects production of only a few critical anti-apoptotic proteins against a background of general translation inhibition. Simultaneous ribosome profiling further reveals potential translational regulation of stress response genes. Once the apoptotic machinery is engaged, degradation by caspases is largely independent of upstream bortezomib effects. Moreover, previously uncharacterized non-caspase proteolytic events also participate in cellular deconstruction. Our systems-level data also support co-targeting the anti-apoptotic regulator HSF1 to promote cell death by bortezomib. This integrated approach offers unique, in-depth insight into apoptotic dynamics that may prove important to preclinical evaluation of any anti-cancer compound."

However, prior to these terminal stages of apoptosis, it is becoming clear that cells fight to resist the pharmacological insult in ways that appear unique to the treatment applied (<a href=\"#bib17\">Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2010</a>). Existing genome-wide studies of cellular response to chemotherapeutic treatment have primarily relied on changes at the transcriptional level (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lamb et al., 2006</a>). Elegant single cell studies have tracked a subset of proteins in response to various chemotherapeutics (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2010</a>).

It is known that cells undergoing apoptosis show strong suppression of protein translation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bushell et al., 2004</a>). While a few specific transcripts are known to escape this translational suppression (<a href=\"#bib61\">Spriggs et al., 2010</a>), the general link between transcriptional and translational changes during apoptosis is not well understood. Furthermore, different chemotherapeutics produce distinct quantitative signatures of caspase cleavage substrates following apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib59\">Shimbo et al., 2012</a>), and it is unclear how the cellular response to chemotherapy prior to apoptotic induction may influence the later deconstruction of cellular protein contents."

Proteasome inhibition has become an effective first-line therapy for this disease, though myeloma currently has no known cure (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lonial et al., 2011</a>). We use a suite of emerging systems-level approaches to globally examine the dynamic interplay between transcription, translation, and proteolytic degradation during chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in this system (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Via ribosome profiling, we identify preferential translation and translational regulation of genes expected to reduce unfolded protein stress after bortezomib treatment. Surprisingly, despite these changes in translational control, during rapid apoptosis only a few critical pro-survival proteins are detectably increased in proteomic studies. Furthermore, we find that cleavage patterns by both caspase and non-caspase proteases during apoptosis are largely independent of drug response at the transcriptional and translational level prior to cell death. We also use this integrated data to examine the potential of small molecule therapeutics to work in concert with bortezomib in myeloma. Such a global examination of how cells struggle at all levels with a chemotherapeutic insult provides important insights into mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and novel methods to assess tumor response to chemotherapy."

Deep sequencing of mRNA (mRNA-seq) examines the detailed transcriptional response of myeloma cells to bortezomib-induced stress. We pair this data with ribosome profiling, the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments during active translation; this approach offers significant insight into proteome dynamics and translational regulation not available by monitoring transcript expression alone (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</a>).

Finally, using enzymatically-driven labeling of free protein \u03b1-amines (N-terminomics) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mahrus et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agard et al., 2012</a>), we develop a quantitative mass spectrometry assay to monitor to the relative kinetics of both caspase and non-caspase cleavage events during apoptotic cellular deconstruction. To begin, we prepared separate flasks of MM1.S cells and harvested cells at five time points after induction of apoptosis with 20 nM bortezomib.

We compared log<sub>2</sub> expression vs the untreated sample and organized the data using unsupervised hierarchical clustering. This approach allowed us to center on relative expression changes found in multiple independent samples.

Clusters \u2018Upreg\u2019 and \u2018Downreg\u2019 encompass transcripts that are generally increased or decreased, respectively, at both the level of mRNA and footprint reads (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Cluster \u2018Stable\u2019 includes transcripts that demonstrate very mild changes at both the mRNA and footprint level. We calculated the translational efficiency (TE) from the ratio of ribosome footprint to mRNA-seq read density for each transcript (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>). This enabled us to characterize two other groups that are particularly interesting, Cluster \u2018TE Up\u2019 and \u2018TE Down\u2019.

Ribosome occupancy in this region may indicate translation of short regulatory polypeptides in upstream open reading frames (uORFs) or production of alternate N-terminal isoforms of canonically translated proteins (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</a>). Others have shown that yeast responding to oxidative stress produce large increases in 5\u2032 UTR translation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gerashchenko et al., 2012</a>). A general decrease in 5\u2032 UTR translation was also seen in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, we identified no overall trend toward altered 5\u2032 UTR translation relative to CDS translation in our system (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). However, these frequency distributions are broad and some individual transcripts do have large changes in the relative translation of the 5\u2032 UTR during apoptosis. We examined transcripts with &gt;twofold change in 5\u2032 UTR translation relative to CDS translation when compared to untreated sample in at least three time points after drug exposure (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). By \u03c7<sup>2</sup> analysis, genes in Cluster Upreg were significantly over-represented among the 274 genes in the increased UTR translation group (p=0.033). Both Clusters Upreg and Downreg were over-represented among the 219 genes in the decreased UTR translation group (p=0.0006 and p=0.014, respectively). No other Clusters showed significant over- or under-representation. We did not find any difference in 5\u2032 UTR length between the groups with most increased and most decreased relative 5\u2032 UTR translation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). IPA (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and inspection of genes in the increased UTR translation group revealed numerous translation elongation and initiation factors, ribosome structural proteins, chaperones (i.e., <i>DNAJA1</i>, <i>HSP90AB1</i>, <i>CCT5</i>, <i>HSPA8</i>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), and proteasomal subunits. The decreased UTR translation group does not show as strong a biological pattern although we do find ubiquitin (<i>UBB</i>), the co-chaperone BAG3, and cytochrome <i>c</i> (<i>CYCS</i>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), that are relevant to bortezomib-induced apoptosis."

Thus, we cannot confidently assign 5\u2032 UTR read density across all genes to specific start codons, particularly non-AUG uORFs. However, we did focus on a subset of genes important in the ER stress response. We first looked at <i>DDIT3</i> (CHOP) and <i>PPP1R15A</i> (GADD34), where in both genes we found strong footprint read density in uORFs known to regulate CDS translation (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jousse et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2009</a>). We next examined other genes with a role in the ER stress response but without known uORF translation. These include <i>DDIT4</i> (REDD1), a repressor of mTOR signaling potentially under control of <i>ATF4</i> (<a href=\"#bib66\">Whitney et al., 2009</a>); <i>TXNIP</i>, recently found to be a key mediator of apoptosis under the UPR (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lerner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Oslowski et al., 2012</a>); and <i>PPP1R15B</i>, which also plays a role in the dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Harding et al., 2009</a>). Intriguingly, all three genes showed apparent uORF translation, identified as areas of increased 5\u2032 UTR read density with a peak corresponding to AUG or near-AUG initiation codons (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>) and bounded by a stop codon on the 3\u2032 end (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

The majority of these proteins show strong upregulation at the mRNA and footprint level and have potential functions mediating either the folding (<i>HSPA1A, DNAJB1, BAG3, HSPB1, SERPINH1, CLU</i>) or degradation (<i>SQSTM1</i>) of unfolded proteins. These proteins are key players in an anti-apoptotic response that reduce cellular stress after proteasome inhibition by bortezomib. Interestingly, we also find ferritin light chain (<i>FTL</i>) increased (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Another group has recently found that depleting ferritin light chain enhances myeloma cell sensitivity to bortezomib (<a href=\"#bib9\">Campanella et al., 2012</a>), suggesting it also plays an anti-apoptotic role here.

This method is analogous to Western blotting without the need for dozens of antibodies and potential improvement in performance characteristics (<a href=\"#bib40\">Maiolica et al., 2012</a>). We prepared an independent biological time course of MM1.S cells treated with 20 nM bortezomib and isolated tryptic peptides from total cellular lysate. We tracked the relative abundance of one to three peptides from 152 proteins. The SRM peak area intensity data was compared to the iTRAQ reporter signal (e.g., in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>, respectively; heat map in <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Comparing across all time points in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> we found a strong correlation between SRM and iTRAQ data (<i>R</i> = 0.80). For the few increased proteins the abundance changes detected by SRM are greater than those found by iTRAQ, which is consistent with the greater suppression of iTRAQ reporter ions often seen in complex samples (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ow et al., 2009</a>). The label-free SRM data do not suffer from this same limitation and more likely reflect the true change in protein abundance. This independent MS assay confirms that only a small subset of proteins show measurable increases in abundance during apoptosis."

We wished to better understand the mechanism leading to this translational shutdown during apoptosis. During the UPR, it is well-known that phosphorylation of the initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 by the ER-resident sensor kinase PERK is associated with general translation inhibition (<a href=\"#bib64\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>). At early time points we find that PERK appears phosphorylated, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib3\">Atkins et al., 2013</a>), and at later time points it undergoes proteolysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In contrast to other drugs that induce ER stress, we find levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation actually decrease after bortezomib exposure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This finding suggests that there must be other drivers of translation inhibition in this system."

Recently developed systems-level technologies, as we use here, enable genome-wide quantitative assessment of the efficiency for decoding of mRNA to protein (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vogel and Marcotte, 2012</a>). In this apoptotic system, proteins are relatively stable due to several factors: at 20 nM bortezomib in MM1.S cells, proteasomal activity is almost completely inhibited (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berkers et al., 2005</a>). The proteasome is also extensively cut by caspases leading to loss of activity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gray et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, we find that endoproteolysis during apoptosis cuts fewer than 20% of the proteins in the cell and often only once or twice per protein leading to stable domains (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dix et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mahrus et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Crawford et al., 2013</a>). These domains would be indistinguishable from intact proteins by iTRAQ. Therefore, we expect that detectable protein degradation is extremely limited and changes by iTRAQ largely reflect protein production alone. In contrast, mRNAs with very different stabilities (steady-state half-lives on the order of minutes to hours) are rapidly degraded with similar kinetics under various apoptotic inducers even prior to cell death (<a href=\"#bib13\">Del Prete et al., 2002</a>)."

These 16 peptides were cleaved with kinetics similar to caspases, suggesting that they may play roles in driving apoptosis. Among these we noted a relative preponderance of Pro (3 peptides), Gln (4 peptides), and Glu (4 peptides) residues at the P1 site (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). While caspases may occasionally cleave at Glu (<a href=\"#bib28\">Krippner-Heidenreich et al., 2001</a>), none of the other classic proteases thought to be active during MM1.S cell apoptosis, including the cathepsins or calpains, have a preference for Pro, Gln, or Glu at the P1 site (as described in MEROPS).

These include NRF2, a transcription factor regulating the hypoxic response; HSF1, a transcription factor regulating the heat shock response; and PERK, the ER-resident kinase. HSF1 in particular regulates the transcription of many genes we also found increased by proteomics experiments (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mendillo et al., 2012</a>)."

Our results show how myeloma cells initially struggle to adapt to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. A general inhibition of translation coupled with mRNA degradation leads to surprisingly little change in overall protein levels despite relative transcriptional increases in many genes. Furthermore, global protein levels are maintained due to inhibition of proteasomal activity by bortezomib and extensive cleavage of proteasomal subunits by caspases (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gray et al., 2010</a>). The cell also modulates translational control of stress responsive proteins related to bortezomib treatment. Co-targeting key regulators of these processes such as HSF1 and PERK can further accelerate apoptosis. Myeloma cells ultimately succumb to the pharmacologic insult, leading to activation of the caspases as well as one or more non-caspase proteases that have yet to be characterized. While pieces of this story have been told by other experiments, the approach we present here, examining the integrated regulation of the transcriptional, translational, and proteolytic machinery, gives a global and in-depth view of the apoptotic process."

Possible mechanisms for the alteration of translation efficiency involve preferential translation via internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bushell et al., 2006</a>), partitioning of transcripts toward ER-bound ribosomes under stress (<a href=\"#bib54\">Reid and Nicchitta, 2012</a>), or other uncharacterized regulatory programs governing ribosomal-transcript association. We also identified uORF translation in genes related to the ER stress response, <i>TXNIP</i>, <i>PPP1R15B</i>, and <i>DDIT3</i> (REDD1), that had not previously been characterized. The exact interplay of uORF and CDS translation for these genes remains to be investigated, but it is possible there is a regulatory function similar to that already known for ATF4, CHOP, and GADD34. We also found that differential 5\u2032 UTR translation appears common in the cellular response to bortezomib but relates variably to increased CDS translation. It will be interesting to compare the effects on translation regulation in different cell types exposed to chemotherapeutics with different mechanisms of action to find whether these changes are unique to bortezomib. Incorporation of translation initiation inhibitors in ribosome profiling and paired-end reads in mRNA-seq can also provide novel insight into translation regulation through generation of custom proteomic databases (<a href=\"#bib62\">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Menschaert et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sheynkman et al., 2013</a>)."

We used a quantitative model incorporating global mRNA degradation to explain this contrast with non-apoptotic systems. While our proteomic analysis is quite extensive, this mass-action model suggests that low abundance proteins not detected by MS, such as CHOP or XBP1 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), are more likely to be increased in relative protein abundance after transcriptional changes. Future advances in proteomic techniques may allow us to detect more biologically relevant protein changes. The mass-action model also suggests the kinetics of protein production from mRNA transcripts largely governs protein abundance (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</a>). In a system undergoing less rapid apoptosis, such as those explored at the single cell level (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2010</a>), there may be greater opportunity for proteins to accumulate and reveal relationships between ribosome footprint occupancy and protein production."

Under conditions of more prolonged apoptosis, however, changes in the proteome may influence the appearance of proteolytic substrates and this remains to be investigated. Furthermore, our identification of non-caspase proteolytic events occurring with similar kinetics to caspase cleavage suggests other proteases are being activated during apoptosis. The biological role of these proteases during apoptosis awaits exploration."

Total mRNA measured in duplicate by NanoDrop in the untreated MM1.S sample (0.88 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5g) was divided by 4 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> cells to estimate the mRNA yield per cell (2.19 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221213</sup> g). mRNA sequencing reads were approximately evenly distributed across A:C:G:T; the average molecular weight of a RNA monophosphate nucleotide (averaged across AMP, CMP, GMP, and UMP) is 339.5 g/mol. We can thus calculate the total number of mRNA nucleotides per cell (<i>T</i>; 6.40 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221215</sup> mol/cell). The copy numbers of individual mRNAs (<i>c</i>) can be calculated by the total number of sequencing reads which mapped uniquely to a given transcript (<i>r</i><sub><i>transcript</i></sub>), the total reads (<i>r</i><sub><i>total</i></sub>; 8,744,024 reads uniquely aligning to hg19 transcripts for the 0 hr MM1.S sample), and the transcript length (<i>L</i>) by the equation:"

In an important initial comparison, the median of the distributions for both mRNA and protein copy per cell are of the same order of magnitude as, though somewhat lower than, those found in <a href=\"#bib57\">Schwanhausser et al. (2013)</a>. This may reflect differences in the cell line (mouse NIH3T3 vs human MM1.S) as well as differences in measurement. However, the overall similarity of the distributions found here to those found by <a href=\"#bib57\">Schwanhausser et al. (2013)</a> indicates that our data are sufficient as a guide for our mass-action model (below). We further emphasize that our data are not intended as a definitive measure of mRNA or protein copy numbers in MM1.S cells. Even if there are systematic errors in the quantitation (i.e., if true protein copies per cell are all threefold higher), the fitting parameters for our mass-action model (see below) will be uniformly scaled but the overall interpretation of the model will be unchanged. This issue of scaling was illustrated in the corrigendum to the original manuscript by <a href=\"#bib57\">Schwanhausser et al. (2013)</a>. The original paper (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</a>) used the incorrect standard for protein abundance estimation, leading to threefold in changes in the protein distribution; the corrected scale led to an increase in the fit parameter <i>k</i><sub>sp</sub> but no changes to the model or conclusions of the paper."

In our experimental system, however, treatment with a high dose of bortezomib effectively blocks proteasomal degradation in this system. Bortezomib\u2019s IC<sub>50</sub> for proteasome inhibition in MM1.S cells is known to be \u223c5 nM (Chauhan D et al., <i>Cancer Cell</i> (2005) 8, 407) and the 20 nM dose has previously been shown to lead to essentially complete proteasomal blockade (Berkers CR et al., <i>Nat Methods</i> (2005) 2, 357). Conversely, other endoproteases (such as caspases) appear to cleave protein substrates in a limited number of sites generating large protein fragments (Crawford et al. <i>Mol Cell Proteomics</i> (2013) 12, 813; Dix et al <i>Cell</i> (2008) 134, 679; Mahrus et al. <i>Cell</i> (2008), 134, 866). In the absence of proteasomal activity, these fragments would be expected to remain stable in the cell as large polypeptides (whether retaining any function or not). By iTRAQ mass spectrometry, based on trypsinization of the total protein sample, these proteolytically cleaved fragments would be indistinguishable from intact proteins. As a result iTRAQ provides no information on caspase (or non-caspase) proteolysis which does not degrade proteins below the domain level. Therefore, in this system we believe that degradation as measured by iTRAQ would both be close to zero for all proteins, and relative iTRAQ data across time points largely reflects protein production."
