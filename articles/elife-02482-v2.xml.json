                    "text": "Histone modifications establish the chromatin states that coordinate the DNA damage response. In this study, we show that SETD2, the enzyme that trimethylates histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3), is required for ATM activation upon DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Moreover, we find that SETD2 is necessary for homologous recombination repair of DSBs by promoting the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments. In agreement, SETD2-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells displayed impaired DNA damage signaling. However, despite the persistence of DNA lesions, SETD2-deficient cells failed to activate p53, a master guardian of the genome rarely mutated in ccRCC and showed decreased cell survival after DNA damage. We propose that this novel SETD2-dependent role provides a chromatin bookmarking instrument that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs. In ccRCC, loss of SETD2 may afford an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint without the need for additional genetic mutations in TP53."

In this study, we show that SETD2, the enzyme that trimethylates histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3), is required for ATM activation upon DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Moreover, we find that SETD2 is necessary for homologous recombination repair of DSBs by promoting the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments. In agreement, SETD2-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells displayed impaired DNA damage signaling. However, despite the persistence of DNA lesions, SETD2-deficient cells failed to activate p53, a master guardian of the genome rarely mutated in ccRCC and showed decreased cell survival after DNA damage. We propose that this novel SETD2-dependent role provides a chromatin bookmarking instrument that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs. In ccRCC, loss of SETD2 may afford an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint without the need for additional genetic mutations in TP53."

                        "text": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most catastrophic form of DNA damage and pose great threat to genome stability. The major sensor of DSBs is ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, which is critical for the initial steps of the DNA damage response (DDR). In response to DSBs, ATM phosphorylates and regulates the activity of several substrates involved in DNA repair, such as p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) and histone H2AX (<a href=\"#bib30\">Matsuoka et al., 2007</a>). To effectively repair a DSB, mammalian cells can choose from two different DDR pathways: nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chapman et al., 2012</a>). During NHEJ, the broken DNA ends are blocked from 5\u2032 end resection and held in close proximity by the Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer (Ku) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lieber, 2010</a>). HR is initiated when the 5\u2032 DNA ends are resected by nucleases and helicases, generating two 3\u2032 single-stranded DNA overhangs coated with phosphorylated replication protein A (RPA) that drives the formation of a RAD51 filament prior to strand invasion (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chapman et al., 2012</a>). In contrast to NHEJ, which promotes direct ligation of the DSB ends in an error-prone manner and is available throughout the cell cycle, HR employs homologous sequences available after DNA replication as templates for error-free DNA repair (<a href=\"#bib38\">San Filippo et al., 2008</a>). Both pathways proceed through a cascade of events whereby DNA damage sensors, transducers, and effectors detect and rejoin the broken DNA ends (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harper and Elledge, 2007</a>). All these events take place within the relatively restricted environment of chromatin, the nucleoprotein complex of histones and DNA assembled into nucleosomes. DNA damage challenges chromatin integrity by eliciting the destabilization and reorganization of its structure (<a href=\"#bib45\">Soria et al., 2012</a>). Conversely, a strictly regulated set of post-translational modifications of the histones N-terminal tails regulates the recruitment and activation of DDR factors (<a href=\"#bib20\">Greenberg, 2011</a>). The most studied response of histones to DNA damage is the phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX, which serves as a molecular beacon that signals the presence of DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rogakou et al., 1998</a>). Phosphorylated H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) arises within minutes after DNA damage and has a key role in the recruitment of multiple DDR factors to the repair centers (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lukas et al., 2011</a>). In addition to \u03b3H2AX, other histone modifications have been shown to play key roles during the DDR, illustrating the importance of a thorough characterization of the chromatin landscape of a DNA lesion. We have recently shown that the histone methyltransferase SETD2 (also termed KMT3 or HYPB), which is responsible for all H3K36 trimethylation, but not H3K36 mono- or dimethylation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Edmunds et al., 2008</a>), acts as a determinant of chromatin integrity by regulating nucleosome dynamics during transcription (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carvalho et al., 2013</a>). A role of H3K36me3 in maintaining chromatin integrity was recently disclosed by the finding that the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein MutS\u03b1 binds H3K36me3 and that SETD2 is necessary for human DNA MMR, a mechanism that corrects mismatches generated during DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Nevertheless, whether SETD2 impinges on the cell's ability to cope with DNA DSBs is not yet known. In this study, we investigate the role of SETD2 on the cellular response to DNA DSBs. Our findings identify a novel role of this histone methyltransferase in rendering cells competent to repair DSBs. We demonstrate using powerful reporter assays that SETD2 is necessary for the DDR and that depletion of SETD2 impairs ATM activation and leads to delayed recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DSBs. Our data further reveal that SETD2 is required for the recruitment of RAD51 to resected DNA 5\u2032 ends and SETD2-depleted cells show reduced homology-directed repair of DSBs."

In ccRCC, the p53-mediated cell cycle checkpoint is frequently inactivated despite the fact that the <i>TP53</i> tumor suppressor gene is rarely mutated (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gurova et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dalgliesh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sato et al., 2013</a>). This puzzling observation suggests that the p53 signaling in ccRCC might be repressed by an alternative mechanism. Herein, we further investigated whether the role of SETD2 in the DDR extends to the regulation of the p53-mediated checkpoint. We show that ccRCC cells carrying inactivating mutations on <i>SETD2</i> phenocopy the impaired DDR observed in <i>SETD2</i> RNAi-depleted human cells. Importantly, SETD2 inactivation severed the p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint despite the persistence of unrepaired DNA lesions in ccRCC cells. We propose that this unprecedented role of SETD2 in the DDR constitutes a novel tumor suppressor mechanism that could explain the high frequency of <i>SETD2</i> mutations found in several cancers and may provide an alternative mechanism for evasion of the p53-mediated checkpoint in <i>TP53</i> wt ccRCC cells."

Human Osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells were challenged with three different DNA-damaging agents: the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide, which is known to induce a large amount of DSBs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burden et al., 1996</a>) and the radiomimetic dsDNA-cleaving agents neocarzinostatin (NCS) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goldberg, 1987</a>) and phleomycin (<a href=\"#bib31\">Moore, 1988</a>). We depleted <i>SETD2</i> mRNA by RNA interference (RNAi) using three different synthetic small interfering RNA duplexes, which resulted in a global loss of the H3K36me3 histone mark that persisted throughout the entire chase periods following the DNA damage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). As a control, we used the GL2 duplex, which targets firefly luciferase (<a href=\"#bib17\">Elbashir et al., 2001</a>). In control cells, the levels of H3K36me3 remained constant during the DDR and were undistinguishable from those of undamaged cells, suggesting that this histone mark is not amplified following the DSBs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). Analysis of the phosphorylation levels of ATM revealed that the DDR was promptly activated upon induction of DSBs with the three compounds (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). ATM phosphorylation (pATM) peaked at the early time points after each treatment in control cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). In contrast, SETD2-depleted cells revealed a significant impairment in DNA damage signaling as revealed by decreased pATM levels detected upon treatment with each of the three drugs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). In agreement with impaired ATM activation, the phosphorylation levels of its downstream substrates H2AX and 53BP1 decreased in SETD2-depleted cells following treatment with NCS or, more appreciably, etoposide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). In DSBs induced by phleomycin, depletion of SETD2 had only a very mild impact on phosphorylation of 53BP1 or H2AX (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) suggesting that either the remaining pATM is sufficient to transduce the DNA damage signaling or that alternative ATM-independent pathways operate in phleomycin-induced DSBs."

Upon depletion of <i>SETD2</i> by RNAi, the amount of DNA measured by quantitative real-time PCR at 250 bp, 300 bp, 350 bp and 2200 bp apart from the <i>I-Sce</i>I site was only 53%, 62%, 57%, and 71%, respectively, of the DNA levels present in control cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These data reveal that ablation of SETD2 leads to persistent DNA 5\u2032 end resection of DSBs. In agreement, phosphorylation of RPA (pRPA), an event that is directly linked to efficient DNA 5\u2032 end resection (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sartori et al., 2007</a>), was detected in SETD2-depleted cells within the first hour after DNA damage with NCS and reached equilibrium after 6 to 8 hr, when its levels were similar to control cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Following DNA damage, the recruitment of RPA to DNA repair centers is revealed by the formation of repair-associated foci, a process that can be visualized by immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). At 8 hr after NCS treatment, widespread RPA foci were observed in the nuclei of both control and <i>SETD2</i> RNAi cells, suggesting that recruitment of RPA to DNA lesion sites is independent of SETD2 activity. As expected, RPA foci were visible only in cyclin A-positive cells that are in S or G2 phase of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

                                "text": "A high frequency of <i>SETD2</i> mutations was recently disclosed in several cancers, of which clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) shows the highest <i>SETD2</i> mutation rate (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dalgliesh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Varela et al., 2011</a>). Our present findings suggest that impaired DDR proficiency constitutes a hallmark of <i>SETD2</i> mutant cancers and could reveal a novel mechanism through which SETD2 suppresses tumor development and growth. To further test this view, we inspected the DDR in ccRCC cell lines containing inactivating mutations in <i>SETD2</i> that result in a strong reduction of H3K36me3 levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Duns et al., 2010</a>). Notably, induction of DSBs in the ccRCC cells resulted in activation of the DDR in a SETD2-dependent manner. Two different <i>SETD2</i> wild-type (wt) cell lines (RCC-JW and Caki-2) responded to DNA damage with the rapid formation of \u03b3H2AX foci and ATM phosphorylation within the first 30 min of the DDR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013D</a>). In contrast, DNA repair was significantly impaired in two <i>SETD2</i> mutant ccRCC cell lines (RCC-MF and RCC-FG2) as revealed by the lack of \u03b3H2AX foci and ATM phosphorylation upon induction of DSBs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013D</a>). These data recapitulate the phenotype of <i>SETD2</i> RNAi-depleted U2OS cells and suggest that defects in the DDR are a hallmark of cancer cells with <i>SETD2</i> mutations. We then attempted to perform a genetic complementation experiment with our SETD2-GFP transgene to rescue the <i>SETD2</i> mutant phenotype. However, despite our efforts, we were not able to obtain a <i>SETD2</i> mutant ccRCC cell population expressing the transgene. One possibility is that loss of SETD2 function in the mutant ccRCC cells feeds a cellular proliferation mechanism that if disrupted upon transfection of the wt SETD2-GFP decreases cell viability. Nevertheless, we consistently observed a similar phenotype of impaired DDR in 4 different ccRCC cell lines (RCC-ER; -FG2; -AB; -MF) carrying inactivating mutations in distinct regions of <i>SETD2</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Duns et al., 2010</a>). Amongst the <i>SETD2</i> mutant cell lines, RCC-FG2 had the lowest levels of H3K36me3 and showed the strongest impairment in the DDR signaling as revealed by the lack of detectable pATM and \u03b3H2AX (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). We shall note that RCC-JW cells carry a missense mutation on <i>SETD2</i> exon 3, which does not interfere with the methyltransferase activity of the enzyme, and for this reason, we classified them as <i>SETD2</i> wt (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Duns et al., 2010</a>). In fact, concerning the DDR, RCC-JW cells behaved equally to two additional <i>SETD2</i> wt ccRCC cell lines (Caki-1 and Caki-2) that were also used on our experiments."

The DNA damage checkpoints employ sensor proteins, such as ATM, to detect DNA damage and to initiate signal transduction cascades that activate p53 and inactivate cyclin-dependent kinases causing inhibition of cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sancar et al., 2004</a>). The tumor suppressor p53 is a direct substrate of ATM kinase (<a href=\"#bib8\">Canman et al., 1998</a>) and is a master effector of the DNA damage cell cycle checkpoints (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sperka et al., 2012</a>). Under normal conditions, p53 protein levels are low owing to MDM2-mediated ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. Upon DNA damage, p53-phosphorylation inhibits its interaction with MDM2, resulting in p53 stabilization (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shieh et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Banin et al., 1998</a>). We therefore evaluated both p53 phosphorylation and its total protein levels in response to DNA damage. The two <i>SETD2</i> wt ccRCC cell lines (RCC-JW and Caki-2) responded to DSBs with p53 phosphorylation and increased total p53 protein levels 2 hr after initiating the DDR (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). In contrast, despite the persistent DNA damage caused by the impaired DDR, <i>SETD2</i> mutant ccRCC cells (RCC-MF and RCC-FG2) evaded the cell cycle checkpoint as revealed by the low levels of p53 phosphorylation and unnoticeable change of its total protein levels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Activation of the p53 checkpoint leads to increased gene expression levels of several downstream targets including <i>CDKN1A</i>, also known as <i>p21</i> (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sperka et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, p21 protein levels rose significantly 2 hr after DNA damage in <i>SETD2</i> wt cells, but not in their mutant counterparts (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). To exclude the contribution of SETD2-independent mechanisms due to the different genetic backgrounds of the <i>SETD2</i> wt and mutant cells, we measured p53 checkpoint activation in <i>SETD2</i> RNAi cells upon treatment with etoposide, NCS or phleomycin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013D</a>). <i>SETD2</i> RNAi-depleted ccRCC cells phenocopied the severed p53 cell cycle checkpoint observed in <i>SETD2</i> mutant ccRCC cells. In response to each of the three DNA-damaging agents, control cells increased the total levels of p53 and p21, whereas SETD2<i>-</i>depleted cells failed to activate p53 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013D</a>)."

In agreement with the impaired ATM activation, spreading of \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 phosphorylation was greatly compromised in SETD2-depleted cells treated with NCS or etoposide, but only marginally affected in DSBs induced by phleomycin. These findings suggest that the DNA damage signaling may follow multiple pathways with different requirements for H3K36me3 and can result in phosphorylation of H2AX and 53BP1 independently of ATM activation. In fact, ionizing radiation-induced H2AX phosphorylation and recruitment of 53BP1 to DSBs can be carried out by ATM and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) in a redundant manner (<a href=\"#bib47\">Stiff et al., 2004</a>). Moreover, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) can also phosphorylate many of the ATM substrates, including H2AX (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ward and Chen, 2001</a>)."

In agreement, we found that induction of DSBs resulted in a significant impairment of the 53BP1 recruitment and increased DNA 5\u2032 end resection in SETD2-depleted cells. However, the increased resection did not reflect increased efficiency of HR repair. Instead, persistent DNA 5\u2032 end resection is likely due to the roadblock in the HR pathway that is created by the failure of RAD51 binding to the single-stranded DNA. Indeed, this defect in presynaptic filament formation on the resected DNA resulted in a 50% reduction in the efficiency of gene conversion of the DR-GFP HR reporter. Exonuclease-mediated resection of DNA ends is known to promote phosphorylation of RPA and to orchestrate an ATM-to-ATR switch at DNA breaks (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shiotani and Zou, 2009</a>). This switch in the main DNA damage sensor provides a reasonable explanation for the RPA phosphorylation and the proficient RPA recruitment to DSBs despite the impaired ATM activation in SETD2-depleted cells. Alternatively, ATM-independent RPA phosphorylation can also be achieved through the activity of DNA-PK (<a href=\"#bib42\">Shao et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Anantha et al., 2007</a>)."

Depletion of LEDGF impairs the recruitment of CtIP and the subsequent DNA 5\u2032 end resection of DSBs. While defects in LEDGF recruitment to DSBs may account for the impaired HR phenotype that we report in SETD2 deficient cells, our data supports an extended LEDGF-independent role of SETD2 in the repair of DSBs by HR. Our findings that DNA 5\u2032 end resection and RPA foci formation are not severely compromised in SETD2-depleted cells disclose a specific presynaptic role for SETD2 that is necessary for the recruitment of RAD51 to single-stranded DNA. One possibility is that H3K36me3 defines a local chromatin state that favors the recruitment of RAD51 to DSBs and successful HR repair. This could be achieved by the FACT histone chaperone upon recruitment to H3K36me3-marked nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carvalho et al., 2013</a>). In agreement with this view, depletion of the FACT subunit SPT16 results in a major impairment of HR (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kari et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Oliveira et al., 2014</a>). FACT is required to recruit the ubiquitin ligase RNF20, which in turn facilitates RAD51 accumulation at DSBs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Oliveira et al., 2014</a>). The view that changes in chromatin dynamics may affect RAD51 function is not completely unexpected as illustrated by the role of the histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) in RAD51 during HR (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). HAT1 promotes acetylation of histone H4, as well as incorporation of histone variant H3.3 at DSBs and facilitates RAD51 recruitment and efficient HR repair. Nevertheless, the major impact of SETD2 on RNA polymerase II transcription and pre-mRNA processing that others and we have previously described (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib13\">de Almeida and Carmo-Fonseca, 2014</a>) discloses the alternative possibility that the impaired formation of RAD51 filaments and HR may result from disrupted gene expression of key DNA repair factors. Hence, additional studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanistic basis of the SETD2 impact on the DDR."

These findings disclose an unprecedented role for a histone-modifying enzyme in priming intact chromatin for the response to DNA damage. A model that emphasizes the regulation of the H3K36me3 accessibility as a major determinant of the DDR can be envisaged. According to this view, the conformational changes that occur after a DSB may cause exposure of H3K36me3 marks previously written by SETD2 in intact chromatin, for instance during transcription by RNA polymerase II or replication. In fact, a careful inspection of the nucleosome structure reveals that lysine 36 on the N-terminal tail of histone H3 does not protrude from the nucleosome core. Instead, this lysine is hidden by the DNA double strand that wraps the histone octameric core (<a href=\"#bib28\">Luger et al., 1997</a>). This sheltered location was first described three decades ago, when Crane\u2013Robinson et al. investigated the accessibility of the histone-terminal domains to proteases. Their experiments revealed that while the first 26 N-terminal residues of histone H3 were greatly sensitive to trypsin digestion, H3K36 was resistant to the enzyme (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bohm et al., 1981</a>). According to this \u2018break and access model\u2019 DNA damage exposes H3K36me3, which then contributes together with a set of well-defined histone modifications to the orchestration of the chromatin landscape that drives the initial recruitment and activation of DDR factors, such as ATM."

Therefore, in these regions the choice between error-prone NHEJ and the more reliable HR pathway is of utmost importance. In fact, most H3K36me3 is found at actively transcribed chromatin where it signals the recruitment of the histone chaperone FACT to reassemble nucleosomes in the wake of RNA polymerase II elongation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carvalho et al., 2013</a>). Should a DSB amputate a coding region, exposure of H3K36me3 previously deposited by SETD2 traveling with the transcriptional machinery may promote DNA repair by HR and would guarantee the integrity of the genetic information."

Our present findings reveal that <i>SETD2</i> mutant ccRCC cells have impaired DDR signaling which leads to inefficient repair of DNA damage. However, the p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint is not activated in SETD2-deficient cells despite the persistence of DNA damage. Depletion of SETD2 abrogates p53 activation, and leads to eviction of the G1/S checkpoint upon DNA damage. In addition to the defects in the DNA damage signaling that we found in SETD2-depleted cells, which could extend to improper p53 activation, it is also possible that SETD2 impinges directly on p53 activity and activation of its downstream targets through direct protein\u2013protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib52\">Xie et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, in the absence of SETD2, the capacity for clonogenic survival following DNA damage is significantly reduced.

CcRCC is an example of a cancer, where a high rate of genomic alterations occurs in parallel to inactivating mutations and deletions of histone modifiers, such as <i>SETD2</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sato et al., 2013</a>). The present study provides a functional link between these two events extending our understanding of the impact of altered chromatin states on the mechanisms that maintain genome integrity. Although it is now evident that alterations in histone modifications are a hallmark of most cancers, it is still unclear whether these changes are drivers or passengers of tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib49\">Waldmann and Schneider, 2013</a>). Our findings endorse the classification of SETD2 as a tumor suppressor and place inactivating mutations in this histone modifier at the peak of a harmful cascade of events that may ultimately drive malignant cell transformation and tumor development."

They demonstrate that SETD2 depletion impairs several key signaling events downstream of DNA double-stranded breaks, including phosphorylation of ATM, H2A.X and 53BP1, recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DNA damage, and formation of Rad51 foci, but not RPA recruitment. Depletion of SETD2 also produces a defect in DNA repair via homologous recombination (HR) and a defect in p53 activation after DNA damage. These findings are also reproduced in clear cell renal carcinoma cell lines carrying SETD2 mutations. The reviewers found these findings to be of high impact and significant, because loss-of-function mutations in SETD2 have been recently documented in various malignancies, suggesting that SETD2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor. The findings in this report may explain, at least in part, how SETD2 suppresses tumor growth."

In the end, the reviewers agreed that the paper would merit publication in a high impact journal such as <i>eLife</i> by including additional experiments and controls that would significantly strengthen the main conclusions, even if further mechanistic insight was not provided."

A direct measurement of the G1 checkpoint should be performed with and without SETD2 to strengthen this statement. Cells can be damaged with IR (or phleo, bleo if not available) followed by a time course using FACS analysis to measure DNA content and G1 arrested cells. siControl and siSETD2 cells can be compared to see if indeed depletion of SETD2 affects the p53-dependent checkpoint at the level of the cell cycle as reported by the authors. In addition, clonogenic DNA damage sensitivity assays with these agents would help show that these defects observed in SETD2 defective cells actually have some biological consequence. As a suggestion, Etoposide should not be used as this response is dependent on TOP2, which might be altered in SETD2 depleted cells.

G1 cells should not show RPA similarly to S/G2 cells since NHEJ is the more prominent DNA repair pathway. Are all of these cells in S/G2? No cell cycle analysis beyond a FACS profile is provided and since resection, DNA repair and DNA damage signaling are regulated throughout the cell cycle, a more careful analysis is warranted. This can be accomplished by using Cyclin A staining in the IF analysis to indicate S/G2 cells and G1 cells that will lack Cyclin A staining. No information is provided for why RAD51, but not RPA, are defective in SETD2 deficient cells. Could the authors discuss a possible mechanism? LEDGF has been shown to bind transcription marks including H3K36me3 and be involved in DNA repair (Daugaard et al. NSMB, 2012) but how SETD2 relates to this work is not discussed. Can you detect defects in CTIP, BRCA1 and/or LEDGF recruitment to damage sites in the absence of SETD2? This data would allow a deeper understanding of what aspect of HR are regulated by SETD2."

Moreover, we provide an integrated view of our novel findings with the role of LEDGF in HR repair. While LEDGF may contribute to the aberrant DDR phenotype that we observe in SETD2-depleted cells, we reason that a novel, LEDGF-independent role of SETD2 is necessary for RAD51 recruitment and HR repair. Following the suggestion made by the reviewers, we analyzed BRCA1 recruitment to DSBs by immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). These new data show that formation of BRCA1 foci in response to NCS is not affected by depletion of SETD2, thus supporting our conclusion that SETD2 plays a presynaptic role that is necessary for the recruitment of RAD51 to DSBs."
