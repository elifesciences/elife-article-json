We present evidence that MEND depends on mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) openings, followed by coenzyme A (CoA) release, acyl CoA synthesis, and membrane protein palmitoylation. MEND is blocked by inhibiting mitochondrial Ca uptake or PTP openings, depleting fatty acids, blocking acyl CoA synthesis, metabolizing CoA, or inhibiting palmitoylation. It is triggered by depolarizing mitochondria or promoting PTP openings. After mitochondrial MEND blockade, MEND is restored by cytoplasmic acyl CoA or CoA. MEND is blocked by siRNA knockdown of the plasmalemmal acyl transferase, DHHC5. When acyl CoA is abundant, transient H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidative stress or PKC activation initiates MEND, but the immediate presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> prevents MEND. The PTP inhibitor, NIM811, significantly increases plasmalemma in normally growing cells. Thus, the MEND pathway may contribute to constitutive as well as pathological plasmalemma turnover in dependence on mitochondrial stress signaling."

We present evidence that MEND depends on mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) openings, followed by coenzyme A (CoA) release, acyl CoA synthesis, and membrane protein palmitoylation. MEND is blocked by inhibiting mitochondrial Ca uptake or PTP openings, depleting fatty acids, blocking acyl CoA synthesis, metabolizing CoA, or inhibiting palmitoylation. It is triggered by depolarizing mitochondria or promoting PTP openings. After mitochondrial MEND blockade, MEND is restored by cytoplasmic acyl CoA or CoA. MEND is blocked by siRNA knockdown of the plasmalemmal acyl transferase, DHHC5. When acyl CoA is abundant, transient H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidative stress or PKC activation initiates MEND, but the immediate presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> prevents MEND. The PTP inhibitor, NIM811, significantly increases plasmalemma in normally growing cells. Thus, the MEND pathway may contribute to constitutive as well as pathological plasmalemma turnover in dependence on mitochondrial stress signaling."

There are many forms of endocytosis, but they usually involve the molecule of interest becoming tucked into a bud that forms in the cell membrane. This bud is then pinched off to leave the molecule inside a vesicle that is inside the cell. In general endocytosis is triggered by \u2018caging\u2019 proteins such as clathrin, but other forms are also possible. These \u201cnon-classical\u201d forms of endocytosis are involved in processes as diverse as the internalization of pathogens and the response of cells to wounding, and sometimes they involve large fractions of the cell membrane being pinched off. Several different forms of \u201cmassive endocytosis\u201d have been observed, but they have remained enigmatic in comparison to the classical forms of endocytosis."

Up to 70% of the cell membrane can be pinched off during this process, especially areas of the membrane in which lipids and proteins are arranged in a more ordered pattern than in the average cell membrane. After massive endocytosis, it takes BHK cells about 30 minutes to replace the regions that were lost during the endocytosis."

In contrast to all other cell organelles, the mitochondria are surrounded by two concentric membranes. The influx of calcium ions causes pores in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, called permeability transition pores, to open so that coenzyme A, a small molecule that is required for fatty acid metabolism, is released into the cytoplasm of the cell. This is followed by the condensation of coenzyme A with a fatty acid and the attachment of fatty acids to the surface membrane proteins. The attachment of these fatty acids (a process known as palmitoylation) evidently promotes ordered regions of the cell surface to coalesce and be pinched off into the cytoplasm as membrane vesicles. A key unanswered question is whether the release of coenzyme A by mitochondria regulates biochemical processes in addition to endocytosis."

Nevertheless, they are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell migration (<a href=\"#bib32\">Howes et al., 2010</a>), cell wounding responses (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tam et al., 2010</a>), and pathogen internalization (<a href=\"#bib71\">Vidricaire and Tremblay, 2007</a>), as well as membrane recycling in some neurons (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gong et al., 2008</a>) and astrocytes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jiang and Chen, 2009</a>). Massive endocytic (MEND) responses described by us (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fine et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hilgemann and Fine, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lariccia et al., 2011</a>) are the largest endocytic responses ever characterized. Large fractions of the plasmalemma that are internalized bind many amphipathic molecules less well than membrane remaining at the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hilgemann and Fine, 2011</a>). Thus, MEND internalizes preferentially the more \u2018ordered\u2019 portions of the surface membrane. Different forms of MEND can be distinguished on the basis of ATP-, polyamine-, and Ca-dependence (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lariccia et al., 2011</a>). In addition, MEND can be initiated by rapidly cleaving sphingomyelin in the outer plasmalemma monolayer with bacterial sphingomyelinase C (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lariccia et al., 2011</a>). It has been suggested that this form of MEND becomes activated during cell wound responses when native sphingomyelinases are translocated to the cell surface via exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tam et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Corrotte et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "We describe here experiments that suggest an entirely different pathway by which MEND occurs in BHK fibroblasts subsequent to large Ca transients. These ATP-dependent endocytic responses are functionally similar to \u2018excessive\u2019 endocytosis that occurs after large Ca transients in secretory cells (<a href=\"#bib63\">Smith and Neher, 1997</a>). Up to 70% of the cell surface of fibroblasts can be internalized, followed by replenishment of the plasmalemma from internal membrane pools over 20 to 40 min (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lariccia et al., 2011</a>). To elucidate the cellular pathway by which MEND occurs, we attempted first to resolve how Ca promotes MEND, and second, to understand why more ordered membrane domains would be selectively internalized. As described here, our data support the hypothesis that Ca transients act initially to prime mitochondria to open PTPs (permeability transition pore) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Giorgio et al., 2013</a>), releasing metabolites to the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib2\">Azzolin et al., 2010</a>). At the distal end of the pathway, our data suggest that palmitoylation of surface membrane proteins promotes the coalescence of ordered membrane domains by promoting protein clustering, as described biochemically (<a href=\"#bib45\">Levental et al., 2010</a>) and as occurs in anoxia-related metabolic stress (<a href=\"#bib19\">Frank et al., 1980</a>)."

                        "text": "That mitochondria might regulate surface membrane palmitoylation and thereby endocytosis is a novel hypothesis. Nevertheless, studies that suggest how this might occur have been available for decades. First, it is known that coenzyme A (CoA), which is synthesized on the outer mitochondrial surface, is accumulated into the matrix space by voltage-sensitive transporters (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tahiliani, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Leonardi et al., 2005</a>), generating CoA gradients to the cytoplasm of at least 50:1 (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tahiliani and Neely, 1987</a>). Therefore, transient openings of nonselective mitochondrial pores, PTPs, can potentially release CoA and generate cytoplasmic CoA transients in the range of tens of micromolar without serious consequences for other mitochondrial metabolites. Second, the low micromolar concentration of free CoA in the cytoplasm has long been suggested to limit cytoplasmic acyl CoA synthetase activities (<a href=\"#bib34\">Idell-Wenger et al., 1978</a>), whereas free CoA is less likely to limit pyruvate dehydrogenases that have higher CoA affinities (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bremer, 1969</a>). Third, it is known that surface membrane proteins, visualized as membrane particles in freeze fracture studies, can cluster and decrease in number (<a href=\"#bib19\">Frank et al., 1980</a>) in a cellular circumstance known to cause PTP openings, namely during anoxia and reoxygenation of cardiac tissue (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brenner and Moulin, 2012</a>). Therewith, a working hypothesis is suggested that mitochondria might control palmitoylation of membrane proteins in response to metabolic stress by releasing CoA to the cytoplasm. In principle, this release may occur not only via PTP openings, but by reverse CoA transport during mitochondrial depolarization caused by partial PTP openings, and via membrane defects that might occur during mitochondrial fission and fusion events in metabolic stress (<a href=\"#bib38\">Knott et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Ong et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Frank et al., 2012</a>)."

One widely-held view is that low conductance PTP openings cause mitochondrial depolarization without loss of metabolites, and thereby release excess mitochondrial Ca to the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huser and Blatter, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Korge et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zhou and O\u2019Rourke, 2012</a>). Nevertheless, it appears possible for mitochondria to release metabolites by transient PTP openings without loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity or even global mitochondrial depolarization (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dumas et al., 2009</a>). Knockout of cyclophilin D, a major PTP regulator (<a href=\"#bib4\">Basso et al., 2005</a>), gives rise to intriguing phenotypes: hearts are mildly protected from ischemia/reperfusion damage, but animals are markedly less tolerant of physical exertion (swimming) and shift their energy metabolism from fatty acids to glucose (<a href=\"#bib16\">Elrod et al., 2010</a>). From the prevailing interpretation of PTP function, these phenotypes will be the result of mitochondria Ca accumulation, driven by the failure of PTPs to open and release Ca when it accumulates in the matrix space. Our working hypothesis predicts that loss of mitochondrial depolarizations will also favor CoA accumulation by mitochondria and cause a decrease of cytoplasmic free CoA. Consequences of a lower cytoplasmic free CoA concentration might include the shift from fatty acid to glucose metabolism, owing to the different CoA affinities of acyl CoA synthetases and pyruvate dehydrogenases noted above."

Thereafter, Ca influx initiated supernormal exocytic responses, from point \u20181\u2019 (before) to \u20182\u2019 (peak), but MEND was fully suppressed. Thus, while rapid mitochondrial depolarization with these agents can activate single MEND responses with very little delay, cells subsequently are refractory to MEND for the duration of patch clamp experiments (\u223c30 min). We report lastly in this connection an experiment set in which we tested for inhibition of MEND by an antioxidant that becomes targeted to mitochondria, Mito-Tempo (<a href=\"#bib36\">Jiang et al., 2009</a>). When included in the pipette solution at 10 \u03bcM, average MEND responses were reduced from 42 \u00b1 7% (n = 10) to 27 \u00b1 6% (n = 8), but the difference was not significant."

To do so, we place the end of a micro-capillary tube within 50 \u03bcm of the orifice of the patch pipette opening. Using positive pressure to generate rapid solution flow, diffusible molecules are exchanged between the cytoplasm and the pipette tip within 2\u20135 s (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hilgemann and Lu, 1998</a>). As described in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, we changed the standard potassium-free cytoplasmic solution as rapidly as possible to one with PTP-promoting constituents (\u2018KSP\u2019 solution), namely succinate (5 mM), Pi (1 mM), free Ca set to 0.25 \u03bcM with 2 mM EGTA, and potassium (100 mM). After a delay of several seconds, MEND responses occurred over a time course of somewhat less that 1 min and amounted to 34 \u00b1 6% of initial cell area at 37\u00b0C. As shown by the lower trace in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, the same protocol induced no response at 22\u00b0C. Nevertheless, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> shows that Standard MEND responses at 37\u00b0C were negligible in cells that were initially opened at 22\u00b0C with KSP solution (potassium/succinate/phosphate-containing solution) in the pipette. Thus, KSP solution, like mitochondrial depolarization, induces a MEND-refractory state within at most 1 min, even when no MEND occurs at 22\u00b0C. Given that cytoplasmic solutes exchange with pipette solutions within a few seconds, this result suggests that metabolites required for MEND might be released and lost into the patch pipette during cytoplasmic application of KSP solution."

To do so, we perfused cells with a high concentration of a CoA-metabolizing enzyme, namely human acetyl CoA synthetase (ACS, 20 \u03bcM; K<sub>d</sub> for CoA, 11 \u03bcM [<a href=\"#bib50\">Luong et al., 2000</a>]) with acetate (Ace, 6 mM) to rapidly convert CoA to acetyl CoA.

The overexpression of PLM caused a three-fold increase in the rate of PKC/mCoA-dependent MEND. This result clearly supports the idea that MEND can be promoted by the presence of proteins that can be palmitoylated and therefore is a \u2018cargo-dependent\u2019 form of endocytosis.

We describe in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> experiments that lend initial support for this possibility by analyzing surface membrane changes in response to treating BHK cells with the putatively specific cyclosporine D/PTP inhibitor, NIM811 (2 \u03bcM). As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, BHK cells are essentially round after removal from dishes. From micrographs, we measured the diameter of each cell in both the \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 directions, calculated the spherical area of each cell, and determined the C<sub>m</sub> of each cell after opening it via patch clamp. In the first group of experiments, BHK cells were removed from dishes and were incubated for 1 or 3 hr, either with or without NIM811 at 37\u00b0C. Results for control cells were pooled, giving three groups of measurements. The average diameters of cells employed (28.2 \u00b1 0.9, 27.8 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcm, and 29.9 \u00b1 1.4 \u03bcm) were very similar. Assuming a specific membrane capacitance of 1 pF per 100 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>, we calculated for each cell the ratio of surface membrane area to the area of a sphere with the cell diameter. For control cells, a ratio of 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 was obtained, indicating that surface membrane undulations account for one-half of the cell surface. After 1 hr of NIM811 treatment this ratio was not changed, but the ratio increased significantly to 2.6 \u00b1 0.1 after 3 hr of incubation. In the second set of experiments, we grew BHK cells normally for 28 hr in the presence of NIM811 (2 \u03bcM) and carried out equivalent measurements after removing cells from dishes. Membrane area in cells of equal size was increased on average by 27% (p&lt;0.01). In summary, treatment of BHK cells with NIM811 causes a significant increase of membrane area after a delay of 1 hr, reaching a plateau within about 3 hr, indicating \u2018either\u2019 that membrane insertion at the cell surface is increased \u2018or\u2019 that membrane removal from the cell surface is decreased, as expected for partial inhibition of endocytosis."

Then, generation of cytoplasmic acyl CoA promotes membrane protein palmitoylation via the DHHC5 acyl transferase.

The following results support the idea that PTP openings are a prerequisite for Ca-activated MEND during the standard protocol: (1) reproducible MEND, constituting 50% of the plasmalemma, requires cytoplasmic Pi, an activator of PTPs (<a href=\"#bib52\">Massari, 1996</a>). (2) MEND is blocked by inhibiting Ca uptake by mitochondria, a mechanism that will stop both mitochondrial depolarization and PTP openings. (3) MEND is blocked by two cyclosporines, one considered a specific cyclophilin D/PTP inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib72\">Waldmeier et al., 2002</a>). Although cyclosporine A also inhibits calcineurin, we determined previously that calcineurin inhibition by FK506 does not inhibit MEND (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lariccia et al., 2011</a>). (4) MEND can be blocked by prior PKC activation, consistent with suggestions that PKCs protect cells from reperfusion injury by inhibiting PTP openings (<a href=\"#bib75\">Ytrehus et al., 1994</a>). (5) MEND occurs when cells are internally perfused with mitochondrial substrates that support PTP openings, namely succinate with Pi in potassium-rich cytoplasmic solution at an optimal free Ca concentration (0.2 \u03bcM, [<a href=\"#bib52\">Massari, 1996</a>]). These responses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) occur without an initial exocytic phase, indicating that Ca release from mitochondria, if it occurs, does not cause large Ca transients in these experiments. (6) Finally, we bring to bear original descriptions of PTP openings, monitored via mitochondrial light scattering (<a href=\"#bib28\">Haworth and Hunter, 1979</a>). Under the conditions of those experiments, the rate at which PTPs open increases over the Ca concentration range of 10\u2013500 \u03bcM, but maximal responses are still obtained with 30 \u03bcM free Ca in less than 10 s. Free cytoplasmic Ca concentrations in our experiments definitively exceed 50 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lariccia et al., 2011</a>), and we activate Ca influx for 10 to 14 s in the Standard MEND protocol.

Accordingly, reverse transport of CoA by depolarized mitochondria would release only about 10% of the mitochondrial CoA content within the delay of 1\u20132 min that precedes the onset of MEND after a Ca transient. This may well be significant in intact cells. However, the fact that KSP solution effectively causes a MEND-refractory state within 1 min at room temperature (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) is much more consistent with rapid CoA loss via diffusion through a pore than via the reverse transport process."

                                "text": "That the pathway to Ca-activated MEND in BHK cells requires generation of acyl CoAs and palmitoylation of proteins at the cell surface is supported by the following evidence: (1) fatty acid depletion of cells for 1 hr, a specific inhibitor of acyl CoA synthetase activity (<a href=\"#bib56\">Omura et al., 1986</a>), and a nonspecific inhibitor of palmitoylation, bromopalmitate, all reduce MEND, and triascin C with bromopalmitate causes complete MEND block. (2) An acetyl CoA synthetase, when perfused into cells together with acetate to deplete CoA, also fully blocks Ca-activated MEND. (3) A high concentration of CoA, which fully blocks acylation activity of a DHHC acyl transferase, fully blocks Ca-activated MEND. (4) When MEND is blocked by four different interventions that probably act through mitochondria, introduction of acyl CoA into the cytoplasm fully restores MEND. (5) Low concentrations of CoA are equally effective as acyl CoA in promoting MEND in these protocols. (6) High CoA concentrations are demonstrated to block DHHC acyl transferase activity and to strongly block MEND, and this block is rapidly reversed by perfusion CoA out of the cytoplasm. (7) Ca-activated MEND, MEND induced by acyl CoA in cyclosporine A-blocked cells, and MEND induced by PTP-promoting substrates (KSP solution) are all selectively inhibited by knockdown of the DHHC5 acyl transferase, which is known to be active at the surface membrane (<a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 2011</a>). As with evidence for mitochondrial involvement, multiple explanations are possible for individual outcomes. However, the results together provide clear evidence that Ca-activated MEND requires acyl CoA synthesis and acyl transferase activity, that is protein palmitoylations, within the time frame in which MEND occurs. While palmitoylation within the secretory pathway clearly can target proteins to the plasmalemma (<a href=\"#bib25\">Greaves et al., 2009</a>), the present data sets clearly suggest that progressively greater palmitoylation of surface membrane proteins can promote removal of proteins from the cell surface by endocytosis. Whether or not MEND requires palmitoylation of specific proteins is not addressed by the present data sets. However, we have demonstrated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> that the presence of a membrane protein that can be dually palmitoylated in a PKC-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tulloch et al., 2011</a>) facilitates the occurrence of MEND. This clearly suggests that MEND is a \u2018cargo-dependent\u2019 endocytic process."

As noted in the Introduction, it is proposed that exocytosis during cell wounding translocates sphingomyelinases to the cell surface, where they subsequently generate ceramide and promote endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tam et al., 2010</a>). Further, it is proposed that caveolae are internalized in a specific manner (<a href=\"#bib11\">Corrotte et al., 2013</a>). From our perspective, it is certain that several different mechanisms can cause MEND (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lariccia et al., 2011</a>), and extracellular application of sphingomyelinase C does so very effectively (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lariccia et al., 2011</a>) when about 50% of cellular sphingomyelin is cleaved (<a href=\"#bib70\">Van Tiel et al., 2000</a>). Our tests for involvement of native sphingomyelinases in BHK MEND responses were entirely negative, and we were able to dissociate exocytosis from MEND (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lariccia et al., 2011</a>). While caveolae might well become involved in MEND, the loss of 70% of the cell surface during large MEND is inconsistent with the much smaller membrane area represented by caveolae in almost all cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bretscher and Whytock, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</a>). In our view, therefore, MEND involves the internalization of ordered membrane domains that can form via phase separation from bulk membrane as the result of multiple synergistic cellular processes, one of them being progressively more extensive palmitoylation of membrane proteins that appears to occur in Ca-activated MEND in BHK cells."

Between one and two percent of the surface membrane is internalized per min, mostly via well-defined coated pits (<a href=\"#bib51\">Marsh and Helenius, 1980</a>). Nevertheless, the precise quantitation of different endocytic forms does not seem secure. Certainly, endocytic mechanisms that internalize \u2018lipid raft\u2019 proteins, in particular GPI-anchored proteins (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lakhan et al., 2009</a>), are also well characterized in BHK cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fivaz et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Refaei et al., 2011</a>). It therefore cannot be discounted that the mechanisms underlying MEND are constitutively active, possibly in dependence on spontaneous mitochondrial depolarizations and superoxide flashes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Elrod et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>) and consistent with the increase of sarcolemma area caused by NIM811 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). MEND can internalize surface membrane at a rate of 50% per min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), at least 25-times greater than constitutive membrane turnover. Therefore, a constitutive activity of the MEND pathway equal to even one percent of its maximal activity would be a substantial endocytic flux in BHK cells."

Clearly, DHHC5 is constitutively functional in cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Thomas et al., 2012</a>), and both PKC activation and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> promote acyl CoA-dependent endocytosis without the activation of Ca transients (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Endocytosis following PKC activation might in principle reflect the endocyotic process that normally inactivates PKCs by removing PKCs from the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carmena and Sardini, 2007</a>). Although generally ascribed to conventional, ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis, a \u2018caveolar\u2019 or \u2018lipid raft\u2019 pathway that is blocked by nystatin has also been shown to participate in PKC inactivation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Leontieva and Black, 2004</a>)."

Therefore, mutations of PLM to modulate selectively its palmitoylation and phosphorylation status should allow insightful experiments. It appears more challenging to elucidate how transient H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidative stress activates endocytosis, although an obvious starting point will be to determine how the palmitoylation status of membrane proteins is changed by transient oxidative stress."

One trigger appears to be release of CoA from mitochondria during mitochondrial depolarizations that involve transient PTP openings (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huser and Blatter, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Korge et al., 2011</a>). Activation of PKCs prior to a Ca transient blocks MEND, while both PKCs and transient generation of ROS support MEND progression at the cell surface. Accordingly, a wave of PKC activation during MEND will tend to restabilize mitochondria but promote ongoing endocytic events. How MEND is related to different categories of \u2018lipid raft\u2019-dependent endocytosis delineated to date (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lajoie and Nabi, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Mayor and Pagano, 2007</a>) remains to be established. It will be of great interest to establish how and if the MEND pathway is related to Ca-activated excessive endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib63\">Smith and Neher, 1997</a>) and bulk endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cousin, 2009</a>) in secretory cells."

The conclusion is that mitochondrial stress induces depolarization or permeability transition pore (PTP) leak of CoA that in turn promote acetyltransferase DHHC5 activity and membrane palmitoylation."
