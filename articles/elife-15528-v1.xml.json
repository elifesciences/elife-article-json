The YTH domain family proteins (YTHDF1-3) bind to m<sup>6</sup>A-modified cellular RNAs and affect RNA metabolism and processing. Here we show that YTHDF1-3 proteins recognize m<sup>6</sup>A-modified HIV-1 RNA and inhibit HIV-1 infection in cell lines and primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. We further mapped the YTHDF1-3 binding sites in HIV-1 RNA from infected cells. We found that overexpression of YTHDF proteins in cells inhibited HIV-1 infection mainly by decreasing HIV-1 reverse transcription, while knockdown of YTHDF1-3 in cells had the opposite effects. Moreover, silencing the m<sup>6</sup>A writers decreased HIV-1 Gag protein expression in virus-producer cells, while silencing the m<sup>6</sup>A erasers increased Gag expression. Our findings suggest an important role of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of HIV-1 RNA in viral infection and HIV-1 protein synthesis."
