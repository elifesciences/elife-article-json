Viral infections by Coxsackieviruses (CVB) may contribute to trigger autoimmunity in T1D. Cellular permissiveness to viral infection is modulated by innate antiviral responses, which vary among different cell types. We presently describe that global gene expression is similar in cytokine-treated and virus-infected human islet cells, with up-regulation of gene networks involved in cell autonomous immune responses. Comparison between the responses of rat pancreatic \u03b1 and \u03b2 cells to infection by CVB5 and 4 indicate that \u03b1 cells trigger a more efficient antiviral response than \u03b2 cells, including higher basal and induced expression of STAT1-regulated genes, and are thus better able to clear viral infections than \u03b2 cells. These differences may explain why pancreatic \u03b2 cells, but not \u03b1 cells, are targeted by an autoimmune response during T1D."
