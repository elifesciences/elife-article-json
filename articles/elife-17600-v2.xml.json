TRPM2 is activated by ADP ribose (ADPR) binding to its C-terminal cytosolic NUDT9-homology (NUDT9H) domain, homologous to the soluble mitochondrial ADPR pyrophosphatase (ADPRase) NUDT9. Reported ADPR hydrolysis classified TRPM2 as a channel-enzyme, but insolubility of isolated NUDT9H hampered further investigations. Here we developed a soluble NUDT9H model using chimeric proteins built from complementary polypeptide fragments of NUDT9H and NUDT9. When expressed in <i>E.coli</i>, chimeras containing up to ~90% NUDT9H sequence remained soluble and were affinity-purified. In ADPRase assays the conserved <i>Nudix-box</i> sequence of NUDT9 proved essential for activity (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>~4-9s<sup>-1</sup>), that of NUDT9H did not support catalysis. Replacing NUDT9H in full-length TRPM2 with soluble chimeras retained ADPR-dependent channel gating (K<sub>1/2</sub>~1-5 \u03bcM), confirming functionality of chimeric domains. Thus, TRPM2 is not a 'chanzyme'. Chimeras provide convenient soluble NUDT9H models for structural/biochemical studies."

TRPM2 is activated by ADP ribose (ADPR) binding to its C-terminal cytosolic NUDT9-homology (NUDT9H) domain, homologous to the soluble mitochondrial ADPR pyrophosphatase (ADPRase) NUDT9. Reported ADPR hydrolysis classified TRPM2 as a channel-enzyme, but insolubility of isolated NUDT9H hampered further investigations. Here we developed a soluble NUDT9H model using chimeric proteins built from complementary polypeptide fragments of NUDT9H and NUDT9. When expressed in <i>E.coli</i>, chimeras containing up to ~90% NUDT9H sequence remained soluble and were affinity-purified. In ADPRase assays the conserved <i>Nudix-box</i> sequence of NUDT9 proved essential for activity (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>~4-9s<sup>-1</sup>), that of NUDT9H did not support catalysis. Replacing NUDT9H in full-length TRPM2 with soluble chimeras retained ADPR-dependent channel gating (K<sub>1/2</sub>~1-5 \u03bcM), confirming functionality of chimeric domains. Thus, TRPM2 is not a 'chanzyme'. Chimeras provide convenient soluble NUDT9H models for structural/biochemical studies."

Indeed, previous work reported weak enzymatic activity for isolated NUDT9H (<a href=\"#bib25\">Perraud et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2003</a>), compatible with the slow timescale of channel gating (<a href=\"#bib5\">Csan\u00e1dy and T\u00f6rocsik, 2009</a>), classifying TRPM2 among channel-enzymes ('chanzymes'). This small group of proteins, in which a single polypeptide chain forms both a transmembrane ion pore and a catalytically active domain, includes two other members of the TRPM subfamily (TRPM6 and TRPM7), and the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) chloride ion channel. In CFTR catalytic (ATPase) activity is strictly coupled to channel gating, which therefore follows a nonequilibrium cyclic mechanism (<a href=\"#bib7\">Csan\u00e1dy et al., 2010</a>). In TRPM7 catalytic (phosphotransferase) activity is not linked to pore gating (<a href=\"#bib20\">Matsushita et al., 2005</a>), but instead serves to regulate expression of TRPM7-dependent genes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Krapivinsky et al., 2014</a>). In the case of TRPM2 the physiological role of the proposed ADPRase activity has not yet been clarified, but we have previously shown that any hydrolytic activity of NUDT9H is not coupled to gating of the TRPM2 channel itself (<a href=\"#bib34\">T\u00f3th et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, our observation of intrinsic instability of several pyridine dinucleotides at basic pH (<a href=\"#bib35\">T\u00f3th et al., 2015</a>) raised the possibility of a similar instability for ADPR, which might lead to false positive results when assessing the hydrolytic activity of a putative slow ADPRase enzyme. It thus remained a question whether the NUDT9H domain truly exhibits any enzymatic activity, not coupled to TRPM2 gating. One way to address this would be to further analyze the TRPM2 ADPR-binding domain in isolation. However, in our hands NUDT9H proved to be extremely insoluble (<a href=\"#bib34\">T\u00f3th et al., 2014</a>), despite its high degree of sequence similarity to highly soluble NUDT9. For this reason we first constructed a series of chimeric proteins built from complementary polypeptide fragments of the two homologous proteins, and correlated solubility with NUDT9H sequence content. This approach allowed us to pinpoint the NUDT9H segments responsible for its insolubility, and to purify and investigate soluble chimeric proteins which contain up to ~90% of the native NUDT9H sequence. We then investigated enzymatic activities of such soluble chimeras in isolation, as well as their capacities to substitute for native NUDT9H in conferring ADPR-dependent gating to the full-length TRPM2 channel."

Because of this unexpected difference we further investigated the two proteins in an attempt to obtain a soluble analogue of NUDT9H. Prompted by the strong similarity between them (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), we generated chimeric constructs by swapping homologous segments between NUDT9 and NUDT9H.

Assuming structural similarity between NUDT9 and NUDT9H, these two structurally distinct regions of NUDT9 provided the basis for generating the first chimeric constructs (Chi1/1A and Chi2/2A), obtained by exchanging the Cap and Core segments of the two native proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The NUDT9-Cap/NUDT9H-Core chimeras Chi1 and Chi1A were insoluble, whereas the NUDT9H-Cap/NUDT9-Core chimeras Chi2 and Chi2A were soluble, and Chi2 could be purified by Ni-affinity chromatography (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The low solubility of NUDT9H is thus caused at least in part by its Core subdomain."

To obtain soluble constructs which more closely resemble NUDT9H, the point of transition from NUDT9H- to NUDT9-sequence was advanced further downstream. For the next construct, Chi3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), this switch point was propagated about halfway through the Core segment, immediately after a well aligned, conserved stretch of amino acids (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) which forms a reentrant loop structure, pivotal for anchoring the Cap to the Core segment in NUDT9. A small fraction of this Chi3 chimera, which contains ~77% of NUDT9H sequence (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), including its <i>Nudix</i> box, remained soluble and could be purified. We then advanced the transition point further downstream, about halfway through the remainder of the NUDT9 sequence in Chi3. This new construct (Chi4) is formed by ~91% of NUDT9H sequence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>), but a small amount of it still remained in the soluble fraction which allowed us to purify it. The low yields of soluble Chi3 and Chi4 could be robustly increased using a slower induction protocol (0.1\u2009mM IPTG, 25\u00b0C, overnight); and replacement of the hexahistidine tag with a Twin-Strep tag (Chi3S and Chi4S) greatly improved protein purity, as confirmed by SDS-PAGE (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and mass spectrometry analysis of the purified Chi4S sample. Indeed, using this slow induction protocol even some soluble NUDT9H protein could be obtained and purified (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, right); however, this preparation precipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Thus, Chi4S remained the best NUDT9H model that we were able to obtain in stable, soluble form (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

                                "text": "The reported enzymatic activity of NUDT9H is about 100-fold lower than that of NUDT9 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Perraud et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2003</a>). Closer inspection of the TLC plates of the inactive proteins indeed revealed very weak AMP spots appearing in the reaction mixtures at basic pH (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a>, lanes 3 and 6). The low sensitivity of the TLC technique requires the presence of at least 0.2\u20130.3\u2009mM AMP for visual detection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, top slice). Thus, assuming 2\u2013300\u2009\u03bcM AMP produced by 1\u2009\u03bcM protein within our 2-hr incubation would suggest apparent <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> values of 0.03\u20130.04\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup> for Chi3S, 4S and NUDT9H at pH 8.5 and 25\u00b0C, in good agreement with the previous reports on NUDT9H (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> ~0.06\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup> at pH 9 and 37\u00b0C). However, our prior observation of spontaneous degradation of several dinucleotides at basic pH (<a href=\"#bib35\">T\u00f3th et al., 2015</a>) prompted us to consider inherent instability of ADPR at basic pH as a possible reason for the observed slow AMP accumulation. Indeed, we found that ADPR undergoes slow degradation to AMP and R5P at pH 8.5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, middle slice; also see <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), highlighting that care must be taken to distinguish spontaneous hydrolysis from true enzymatic activity. At 25\u00b0C and pH 8.5 ~20% of ADPR degraded spontaneously in 24\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, middle slice, compare the two lanes marked by asterisks), indicating a decay time constant of ~100\u2009h, and thus ~2% degradation in 2\u2009hr: this rate of spontaneous degradation indeed fully accounts for the weak AMP spots observed for Chi3S, 4S, and NUDT9H at basic pH. More importantly, addition of either 0.1 or 1\u2009\u03bcM Chi4S to ADPR-containing reaction mixtures at basic pH, either with (RB6) or without (RB3) 100\u2009mM NaCl, did not affect the rate of spontaneous AMP accumulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, bottom slice). This clearly demonstrates that Chi4S does not possess any hydrolytic activity towards ADPR, most likely due to critical substitutions in its <i>Nudix</i> box (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; cf., [<a href=\"#bib26\">Perraud et al., 2003</a>]), and that the observed slow accumulation of AMP is merely caused by ADPR instability at basic pH."

To test whether such pH dependence might also apply for NUDT9, but could not be observed at the chosen timescale of 2\u2009hr, we analyzed for both enzymes the time course of AMP accumulation in ADPR-saturated reaction mixtures at the three different pH values (in RB1, RB2 and RB3). Both NUDT9 and Chi2 showed a clear preference for basic pH, causing AMP accumulation to be fastest at pH 8.5 and slowest at pH 6.5 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). The calculated <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> values (in s<sup>\u22121</sup>) quantify this pH dependence of catalytic rates for both proteins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), and reveal higher sensitivity for Chi2 (~5.8-fold decrease from pH 8.5 to 6.5) compared to NUDT9 (~1.4-fold decrease from pH 8.5 to 6.5). Spontaneous degradation of ADPR at basic pH (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, middle slice) is not a major contributor to this pH dependence, because the total duration of these kinetic experiments (~20\u2009min) was too short for that effect to become significant: correction for the ~30\u2009\u03bcM AMP which forms spontaneously in 20 min at pH 8.5 would amount to a downward adjustment of those <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> values (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <i>black bars</i>) by only ~0.05\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup>. Furthermore, whereas we cannot exclude the possibility that the two proteins were applied at slightly different concentrations, and that this may have caused the observed differences in their absolute reaction rates, investigating pH dependence of activity of a given enzyme (i.e. the same protein stock) is not subject to such limitations. Of note, the <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> of 9\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup> for NUDT9 at pH 8.5 is very similar to previously reported values (~8\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup>, [<a href=\"#bib25\">Perraud et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2003</a>])."

                                "text": "The TLC assay allows unambiguous identification of the reaction product AMP based on its chromatographic mobility, but its resolution is limited. As an independent approach, we therefore verified enzymatic activities at both 37\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and room temperature (RT, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) for NUDT9, Chi4S, and NUDT9H using the more sensitive colorimetric detection of inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>), liberated from both ADPRase products (AMP and R5P) by co-applied alkaline phosphatase (AP) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rafty et al., 2002</a>). As a validation of this coupled assay, no significant amounts of contaminating P<sub>i</sub> were found in either the applied stock of AP (5\u20136 U), or in 1-mM solutions of ADPR, AMP, or R5P (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>, <i>first four group of bars</i>). Moreover, in the 30-min time frame of our incubation AP released stoichiometric amounts (~1\u2009mM) of P<sub>i</sub> from either AMP or R5P (but not from ADPR), confirming that under our experimental conditions the AP reaction is not rate limiting for the coupled assay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>, <i>groups 5\u20137</i>), releasing 2\u2009mM of P<sub>i</sub> per mM ADPR hydrolyzed. When NUDT9 (5 or 50 nM) was co-applied with 1\u2009mM ADPR and AP, the released P<sub>i</sub> roughly scaled with the applied amount of protein, signalling specific ADPR hydrolysis by NUDT9 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>, <i>groups 8\u20139</i>). Comparison of released [P<sub>i</sub>] for assays performed at pH values between 6.5 and 9.0 confirmed modest but significant enhancement of NUDT9 activity at basic pH (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>, compare <i>four colored bars</i> within <i>groups 8\u20139</i>). Molecular turnover rates (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>), calculated from the 5-nM NUDT9 data, were in the range of ~4\u201311\u2009s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), in good agreement with the estimates from the TLC assay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In contrast, co-applying 5 or 50 nM of either Chi4S or NUDT9H with 1\u2009mM ADPR and AP did not result in any significant P<sub>i</sub> release (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>, <i>groups 10\u201313</i>; expanded in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>): the small concentrations of P<sub>i</sub> released in these assays (corresponding to the hydrolysis of ~1% of the applied 1\u2009mM ADPR) clearly reflect spontaneous ADPR hydrolysis (cf., <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), because they remained insensitive to a ten\u00a0fold variation in Chi4S or NUDT9H concentration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, compare <i>groups 4\u20135</i> and 6\u20137), and were not larger than the [P<sub>i</sub>] released in the absence of any ADPRase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <i>group 3</i>)."

To verify functionality also for enzymatically inactive Chi3(S) and Chi4(S), we tested whether any of these constructs could substitute for the native NUDT9H domain in the context of full-length TRPM2, to confer ADPR-induced gating upon the channel. For this purpose we used the non-inactivating (<a href=\"#bib33\">T\u00f3th and Csan\u00e1dy, 2012</a>) T5L-TRPM2 pore mutant (hereafter 'TRPM2'), and subcloned Chi2, Chi3 and Chi4 into TRPM2, replacing its native NUDT9H domain. The three full-length chimeric channels (TRPM2-Chi2, TRPM2-Chi3 and TRPM2-Chi4) were then expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and tested for ADPR-dependent channel activation in inside-out patches. For all three constructs cytosolic superfusion with ADPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered macroscopic currents (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>) resembling those of unmodified T5L-TRPM2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), indicating successful ligand binding to the chimeric domains: in 1\u2009\u03bcM ADPR, the previously established half-saturating concentration for TRPM2 (<a href=\"#bib33\">T\u00f3th and Csan\u00e1dy, 2012</a>), similar fractional currents were activated for TRPM2, TRPM2-Chi3, and TRPM2-Chi4 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C\u2013E</a>), indicating similar apparent affinities for ADPR. Fractional activation of TRPM2-Chi2 by 1\u2009\u03bcM ADPR was reduced (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,E</a>), reflecting a modest, ~3.5-fold increase in the K<sub>1/2</sub> for ADPR-induced current activation in TRPM2-Chi2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). The time constants of current decay upon ADPR removal were two\u2013three-fold shorter for the chimeric constructs compared to TRPM2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>), whereas the relaxation time constants upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal were nearly identical (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). Overall, apart from moderate kinetic differences, all chimeric channel constructs were gated by ADPR similarly to TRPM2, indicating that their chimeric ligand-binding domains are functional in the context of the full-length channel."

In the case of CFTR ATP hydrolysis by two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Li et al., 1996</a>) appears to be an evolutionary vestige inherited from some ancestral ABC exporter (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gadsby et al., 2006</a>): whereas in transporters the energy of ATP hydrolysis is harnessed to drive a cycle of conformational changes that result in thermodynamically uphill substrate transport, in CFTR ATP-binding induced dimerization of the two NBDs is strictly coupled to opening, and dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis to closure, of its transmembrane anion-selective pore (<a href=\"#bib7\">Csan\u00e1dy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Vergani et al., 2005</a>). Such a nonequilibrium cyclic gating mechanism is unique among ion channels which mediate downhill electrodiffusion of ions, and confers specific properties on CFTR, including stimulation of channel open probability by catalytic-site mutations (<a href=\"#bib38\">Vergani et al., 2003</a>), or by drug-induced stabilization of energy barriers (<a href=\"#bib6\">Csan\u00e1dy and T\u00f6r\u00f6csik, 2014</a>). The other well studied chanzyme is the TRPM7 cation channel, which contains a kinase domain fused to its cytosolic C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib28\">Runnels et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Nadler et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Yamaguchi et al., 2001</a>). In this protein the catalytic activity of the enzymatic domain does not appear to be linked to gating of the channel pore, because phosphotransferase and channel activities can be modulated independently of each other (<a href=\"#bib20\">Matsushita et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Schmitz et al., 2003</a>) and the kinase domain is functional when expressed on its own (<a href=\"#bib3\">Clark et al., 2008</a>). Nevertheless, recent work uncovered unexpected important specific functions of TRPM7 enzymatic activity: the kinase domain is proteolytically cleaved and translocates to the cell nucleus where it regulates gene expression by phosphorylating histones in the promoters of TRPM7-dependent genes. Moreover, Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent binding of the kinase domain to histone remodeling complexes provides a functional link to the TRPM7 channel pore, a major Zn<sup>2+</sup> influx pathway (<a href=\"#bib18\">Krapivinsky et al., 2014</a>)."

Early demonstration of ADPR hydrolase activity for the isolated ligand binding domain NUDT9H classified TRPM2 as a chanzyme (<a href=\"#bib25\">Perraud et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2003</a>), and raised intriguing questions about the possible role of this activity: all the more as the reported slow turnover rate (~0.1\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>) falls into the range of channel gating rates (<a href=\"#bib33\">T\u00f3th and Csan\u00e1dy, 2012</a>). Of note, while this slower rate of catalysis of NUDT9H, compared to NUDT9, was explained by lack of a conserved glutamate in its Nudix box motif important for Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordination, the actual catalytic base is highly variable in Nudix enzymes, and has not yet been identified for either of these two proteins (<a href=\"#bib31\">Shen et al., 2003</a>). However, when introduced into NUDT9H, catalytic site mutations that abolish, or greatly diminish, ADPRase activity of NUDT9 failed to affect the rates of pore gating, and TRPM2 channels were also readily gated by a non-hydrolyzable ADPR analog (<a href=\"#bib34\">T\u00f3th et al., 2014</a>). These findings ruled out a direct link between the ADPRase cycle and gating of the TRPM2 channel pore itself, but did not eliminate the possibility of some, as yet unidentified, role for this catalytic function. The present work therefore addressed the putative enzymatic activity itself."

The C-terminus of NUDT9 is surface exposed ([<a href=\"#bib31\">Shen et al., 2003</a>]; PDB ID: 1Q33; 1QVJ), free to interact with other protein molecule(s), and presumably the same is true for the C-termini of the chimeras and NUDT9H. Therefore, among other reasons, the cumulative charge of the C-terminus may play an important role in determining their aggregation propensity during expression in the bacterial cytoplasm (at around neutral pH). The theoretical total charges of the ~60\u201370 C-terminal residues of our constructs (ignoring affinity tags) are \u22128.1 (NUDT9, Chi2 and Chi3), +0.9 (NUDT9H), \u22122.9 (Chi4) at pH 7.0. It is thus possible that the relative charge-neutrality of the C-terminus of NUDT9H contributes to its insolubility."

A likely explanation is that NUDT9H natively exists in the context of tetrameric TRPM2, and must share an interface with other channel regions which transduces ligand binding into pore opening. Whether NUDT9H interacts with the large N-terminal domain of the channel, with the cytosolic loops connecting the transmembrane helices, and/or with other NUDT9H domains remains to be elucidated, but it is tempting to speculate that the C-terminal ~20% of NUDT9H sequence might be directly involved in such interactions. Consistent with such an interpretation, incremental replacement of NUDT9H segments with corresponding NUDT9 sequences (TRPM2(-NUDT9H) \u2192 TRPM2-Chi4 \u2192 TRPM2-Chi3 \u2192 TRPM2-Chi2) causes a parallel graded decrease in the stability of the open-channel state, as reflected by a speeding of channel closure upon ADPR removal (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>; <i>gray</i> \u2192 <i>red</i> \u2192 <i>dark blue</i> \u2192 <i>light blue bars</i>)."

Both enzymes exhibited a modest but clear pH-dependence, with a preference towards basic pH (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Perhaps NUDT9, which natively resides in mitochondria, might have adapted to this environment, and Chi2, which contains ~60% of the NUDT9 sequence (the entire Core subdomain), presumably shares most of its preferences. In contrast, the cytosolic NUDT9H domain of plasma-membrane resident TRPM2 faces the neutral pH of the cytosol. For this reason, care was taken to test the NUDT9H-like proteins (Chi3S, Chi4S and NUDT9H) in buffers at different pH values (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>)."

One possible reason for this small defect is that the other constructs contain catalytically inactive <i>Nudix</i> domains, whereas ADPR hydrolysis by Chi2 might reduce fractional saturation of this domain at low (~1\u2009\u03bcM) ADPR concentrations. Alternatively, the significantly larger portion of non-native (i.e. NUDT9-like) sequence in Chi2 (the entire Core subdomain) might compromise formation of the proper interface responsible for transducing ligand binding into channel opening. Nevertheless, all full-length chimeric TRPM2 constructs formed functional channels, demonstrating that NUDT9/NUDT9H chimeric domains are properly folded and competent to bind ADPR and gate the channel. Importantly, TRPM2-Chi4 is almost identical in sequence to the background T5L-TRPM2, its channel behaviour is almost indistinguishable from that of T5L-TRPM2, and we have clearly shown that its isolated ligand-binding domain (Chi4S) \u2013 although capable of binding an ADPR analog with a similar affinity as the intact NUDT9H domain of a full-length TRPM2 channel (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) \u2013 is not catalytically active. Based on these results, we conclude that the NUDT9H domain of TRPM2 is not an ADPR hydrolase, and that TRPM2 is a simple ligand-gated channel, not a 'chanzyme', despite the fact that its ligand binding domain is clearly a member of the family of Nudix enzymes. One potential advantage of its broken enzymatic activity might be increased ligand occupancy at low ADPR concentrations. The Chi4S construct developed here is a convenient soluble model of NUDT9H which might be useful for future structural and biochemical studies."

Enzyme activities were assayed in at least three independent experiments. Gating parameters for full length TRPM2 and chimeric channels were estimated from current recordings obtained from at least five patches in each case. These numbers of technical replications allowed us to limit SEM to \u226420% of the mean for each measured parameter."

This domain is homologous to the soluble mitochondrial ADPR pyrophosphatase (ADPRase) NUDT9, but as shown here, does not hydrolyze ADPR. Reported ADPR hydrolysis classified TRPM2 as a channel-enzyme, but insolubility of isolated NUDT9H hampered further study. The authors develop a soluble NUDT9H, by replacing incrementally extended N-terminal portions of NUDT9 with homologous NUDT9H sequence. When expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, chimeras containing up to ~90% NUDT9H sequence remained soluble and were affinity-purified. In ADPRase assays, the conserved Nudix-box sequence of NUDT9 proved essential for activity (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>~4-9s<sup>-1</sup>) \u2013 NUDT9H itself did not support catalysis. Replacing NUDT9H in full-length TRPM2 with soluble chimeras retained ADPR-dependent channel gating, confirming functionality of chimeric domains. Based on these results, the authors conclude that the NUDT9H domain of TRPM2 is not an ADPR hydrolase, and that TRPM2 is a simple ligand-gated channel, not a \"chanzyme\". The authors speculate that the potential advantage of its broken enzymatic activity might be increased ligand occupancy at low ADPR concentrations."

Both inactive proteins \u2013 Chi4S and NUDT9H \u2013 show a main monomeric peak which can be isolated fairly well, and a smaller peak corresponding to a dimer, just as the highly soluble (and active) NUDT9 protein. Higher-stoichiometry aggregates constitute only a minor fraction in each case. Only the fractions corresponding to the monomeric peaks were collected and pooled for further use in functional assays. Thus, lack of catalytic activity for Chi4S and NUDT9H is not due to protein microaggregation in a quasi-stable solution.

For the enzymatic assays these preparations were not further concentrated, but rather diluted (to 0.1-1 \u03bcM for the TLC-based, and to 5-50 nM for the colorimetric assay). The only assay in which the protein was concentrated following SEC was the fluorescent binding assay (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C-D</a>): here we had to concentrate Chi4S by ~5-fold, to reach a concentration of 100 \u03bcM (3.6 mg/ml). Originally we did not re-run the Chi4S protein on SEC following the binding assay, but we have now performed a control experiment to mimic the effect of this concentration step, and show the results in <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Chi4S was expressed and purified as before (solid blue SEC elution profile), left overnight at 4<sup>o</sup>C, and then concentrated 5-fold using a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff Vivaspin column (Sartorius). The concentrated protein was then re-run on SEC, and the elution profile (dashed blue profile) again showed a preserved main monomeric peak with a smaller peak corresponding to a dimer. Importantly, larger aggregates did not reappear. This confirms that the signal observed in the fluorescent binding assay is not due to non-specific effects of aggregated protein. We have added this information to the Materials and methods section that describes the binding assay."
