                    "text": "The Turing reaction-diffusion model explains how identical cells can self-organize to form spatial patterns. It has been suggested that extracellular signaling molecules with different diffusion coefficients underlie this model, but the contribution of cell-autonomous signaling components is largely unknown. We developed an automated mathematical analysis to derive a catalog of realistic Turing networks. This analysis reveals that in the presence of cell-autonomous factors, networks can form a pattern with equally diffusing signals and even for any combination of diffusion coefficients. We provide a software (available at <a href=\"http://www.RDNets.com\">http://www.RDNets.com</a>) to explore these networks and to constrain topologies with qualitative and quantitative experimental data. We use the software to examine the self-organizing networks that control embryonic axis specification and digit patterning. Finally, we demonstrate how existing synthetic circuits can be extended with additional feedbacks to form Turing reaction-diffusion systems. Our study offers a new theoretical framework to understand multicellular pattern formation and enables the wide-spread use of mathematical biology to engineer synthetic patterning systems."

It has been suggested that extracellular signaling molecules with different diffusion coefficients underlie this model, but the contribution of cell-autonomous signaling components is largely unknown. We developed an automated mathematical analysis to derive a catalog of realistic Turing networks. This analysis reveals that in the presence of cell-autonomous factors, networks can form a pattern with equally diffusing signals and even for any combination of diffusion coefficients. We provide a software (available at <a href=\"http://www.RDNets.com\">http://www.RDNets.com</a>) to explore these networks and to constrain topologies with qualitative and quantitative experimental data. We use the software to examine the self-organizing networks that control embryonic axis specification and digit patterning. Finally, we demonstrate how existing synthetic circuits can be extended with additional feedbacks to form Turing reaction-diffusion systems. Our study offers a new theoretical framework to understand multicellular pattern formation and enables the wide-spread use of mathematical biology to engineer synthetic patterning systems."

In such \u201creaction-diffusion\u201d systems, the interactions between the molecules cause repeating peaks in their concentrations in different locations, which could influence how different parts of the embryo develop.

Instead, some networks can form patterns with signals that diffuse at equal rates, while others can form patterns with any combination of diffusion rates."

More than six decades ago, Alan Turing proposed a theoretical model in which interactions between diffusible substances can break the initial symmetry of cell fields to form periodic patterns (<a href=\"#bib74\">Turing, 1952</a>). Subsequent work from Gierer and Meinhardt postulated that such self-organizing processes require differential diffusivity between a short-range self-enhancing activator and a feedback-induced long-range inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</a>). Numerous studies have proposed models based on these concepts to explain pattern formation during development, including skin appendage specification (<a href=\"#bib73\">Sick et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Harris et al., 2005</a>), lung branching (<a href=\"#bib42\">Menshykau et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hagiwara et al., 2015</a>), tooth development (<a href=\"#bib65\">Salazar-Ciudad and Jernvall, 2010</a>), rugae formation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Economou et al., 2012</a>), and digit patterning (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sheth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Raspopovic et al., 2014</a>). However, the evidence in support of specific activator-inhibitor pairs has been limited, and few studies have provided experimental support for the differential diffusivity of activators and inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kondo and Miura, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Marcon and Sharpe, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">M\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>)."

However, since most reaction-diffusion models have been reduced to abstract networks of two diffusible reactants, the influence of immobile cell-autonomous factors on reaction-diffusion patterning is largely unknown. Previous theoretical studies on selected network topologies have challenged the differential diffusivity requirements and indicated that in the presence of an immobile substance, patterns can form for a wider range of reaction and diffusion parameters (<a href=\"#bib54\">Othmer and Scriven, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pearson and Horsthemke, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Pearson, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pearson and Bruno, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Rauch and Millonas, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Levine and Rappel, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Miura et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Raspopovic et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Korvasova et al., 2015</a>). These and other studies (<a href=\"#bib40\">Meinhardt, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Werner et al., 2015</a>) suggest that extending models beyond abstract two-node systems can reveal different pattern formation requirements and may uncover new biologically relevant network designs. However, due to the complex mathematical analysis required to identify and understand such systems, extending reaction-diffusion models to more realistic signaling networks has been challenging, and the main assumption in the field has\u00a0remained that complex models should reduce to simple systems that require an effective differential diffusivity."

In comparison to previous numerical studies, this method guarantees completeness, reproducibility, and detailed mechanistic insights into the principles underlying pattern formation. We used RDNets to build a comprehensive catalog of minimal three-node and four-node reaction-diffusion networks that include interactions between diffusible signals and cell-autonomous factors. Our results show that reaction-diffusion systems have three types of requirements for the diffusible signals depending on the network topology: Type I networks require differential diffusivity, Type II networks allow equal diffusivities, and Type III networks allow for unconstrained diffusivity. Overall, 70% of the networks identified by our analysis are of Type II and Type III and thus do not require differential diffusivity to form a spatial pattern. This reveals that realistic reaction-diffusion systems are based on mechanisms that are fundamentally different from the concepts of short-range activation and long-range inhibition based on differential diffusivity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</a>) that have been predominant in previous models of pattern formation. Our software can be used to explore these new networks and is a unique tool to understand <i>in vivo</i>\u00a0reaction-diffusion systems and to engineer synthetic circuits with spatial patterning capabilities."

Previous studies have overcome this obstacle by using numerical simulations to screen for topologies that implement a certain behavior (<a href=\"#bib64\">Salazar-Ciudad et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ma et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cotterell and Sharpe, 2010</a>). However, such simulations demand large computational power, their coverage is incomplete, and they do not have the explanatory power of analytical approaches.

We found that Type III networks are not only numerous but also extremely robust to changes in parameter values compared to Type I and Type II networks (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>, Materials and methods). Using numerical simulations, we systematically confirmed our mathematical analysis and determined that a network can form all possible combinations of in-phase or out-of-phase periodic patterns depending on the network topology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>, Appendix 1). Together, our results show that realistic reaction-diffusion networks are intrinsically robust, do not require differential diffusivity, and have patterning capabilities identical to classical two-node reaction-diffusion models.

This analysis determines which feedback cycles contribute to the stability and the instability conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,b</a>) and defines the topological features that underlie Type I, Type II, and Type III networks. In agreement with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib49\">Murray, 2003</a>), our analysis confirmed that two-node networks can only simultaneously satisfy the stability and instability conditions when the diffusion ratio <i>d</i> between the inhibitor and the activator is greater than one (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, left column). This observation has been linked with the widespread belief that reaction-diffusion systems require differential diffusivity to implement short-range auto-activation and long-range inhibition. Our analysis instead suggests that the differential diffusivity requirement arises from the opposite nature of the stability and instability conditions, which require that the destabilizing feedback must be both higher and lower than the stabilizing feedback. Since the diffusion term only appears in the destabilizing condition, it assumes the role of a unique pivot that can satisfy both conditions simultaneously when <i>d &gt;</i> 1. Our results indicate that the presence of non-diffusible nodes allows feedbacks that do not appear in the instability conditions to act as an additional pivot to satisfy both conditions simultaneously by increasing stability. This is the case for most Type II networks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, middle column) that contain additional negative feedbacks that allow for equal diffusivities (<a href=\"#bib29\">Klika et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Korvasova et al., 2015</a>). Importantly, our analysis also reveals that non-diffusible nodes can implement positive feedbacks that can drive the network unstable independently of stabilizing feedbacks and for any diffusion ratio <i>d</i>. This is the case for Type III networks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, right column), where the stability and instability conditions are uncoupled and can be simultaneously satisfied for large parameter sets. This is possible because immobile factors can act as 'capacitors' that retain and amplify perturbations independently of the reactants\u2019 diffusion coefficients (see Appendix 3 for details). Such systems represent a fundamentally new pattern formation mechanism that has not been described previously."

The virtually indistinguishable simulations of Type I networks with differential diffusivity and Type II networks with equal diffusivities reveal that the final aspect of the periodic patterns does not reflect a difference in the range of activators and inhibitors but only a difference in their amplitude (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>, see Appendix 3 for details). Indeed, in other Type II and Type III networks the relationship between the amplitude of activators and inhibitors can even be inverted, such that the perceived range of the activator appears larger than the perceived range of the inhibitor. Therefore, in contrast to previous studies (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kondo and Miura, 2010</a>), we propose that long-range lateral inhibition is not required to limit the expansion of the activator (Appendix 3)."

In agreement with this hypothesis, the self-enhancing activator Nodal has been shown to diffuse 7.5 times slower than the feedback-induced inhibitor Lefty in living zebrafish embryos (<a href=\"#bib50\">M\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>). The Nodal/Lefty system has been modeled as a two-component activator-inhibitor system (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nakamura et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">M\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>), but the influence of cell-autonomous factors including receptors and the well-characterized intracellular signal transduction cascade via phosphorylated Smad2/3 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Schier, 2009</a>) has not been studied. We used our software to screen for networks that extend the two-node Nodal/Lefty system with a non-diffusible node corresponding to active Nodal signaling (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). The screen was constrained with known qualitative regulatory interactions: a positive feedback loop between Nodal and its signaling, and a promotion of Lefty by Nodal signaling (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Moreover, we constrained the two negative self-regulations on Nodal and Lefty, which represent their clearance from the diffusible pool, with the previously measured clearance rate constants (<a href=\"#bib50\">M\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>). Finally, we selected only reaction-diffusion networks that produced in-phase patterns of Nodal and Lefty, which recapitulate their overlapping expression domains (<a href=\"#bib68\">Schier, 2009</a>). With these constraints, our mathematical analysis identified just two possible minimal networks: In one network Lefty inhibits Nodal signaling indirectly at the receptor level, and in the other network Lefty inhibits Nodal directly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). These predictions are in agreement with the two possible mechanisms by which Lefty has been proposed to inhibit Nodal activity: by binding to the Nodal receptor or by directly sequestering Nodal (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen and Shen, 2004</a>). However, the role and significance of these two alternative mechanisms for Nodal/Lefty-mediated patterning has remained unclear (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cheng et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Middleton et al., 2013</a>). Our mathematical analysis predicts that the first mechanism (Lefty blocks the receptor complex) determines a Type II network, whereas the second mechanism (Lefty blocks Nodal directly) determines a Type III network. Importantly, both models suggest that the Nodal/Lefty system may form patterns without differential diffusivity of activator and inhibitor. Using the clearance rate constants of Nodal and Lefty as quantitative constraints, our mathematical analysis predicts a possible minimum diffusion ratio <i>d</i> = 0.55 for the Type II network, whereas the Type III network allows for any combination of diffusion coefficients (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). The robustness analysis of the networks shows that for unconstrained valued of <i>d</i>, the Type III network is more robust to parameter changes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). However, when we fix the diffusion ratio to the experimentally quantified value (<a href=\"#bib50\">M\u00fcller et al., 2012</a>)\u00a0(<i>d</i> = 7.5), the Type II network becomes more robust than the Type III network (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). This shows that, while Nodal and Lefty do not necessarily need to have different diffusivities to form a pattern, the combination of differential diffusivity and clearance rate constants increases the robustness of the Type II system."

                                "text": "As a second example, we used RDNets to analyze the BMP/Sox9/Wnt (BSW) self-organizing network that underlies digit patterning (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sheth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Raspopovic et al., 2014</a>). The expression patterns and the signaling activity of the network components have been well-characterized showing that Sox9 forms periodic expression peaks that are out-of-phase of <i>BMP</i> expression and Wnt activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). A three-node reaction-diffusion network with two diffusible nodes for the secreted signals BMP and Wnt and a non-diffusible node for the transcription factor Sox9 has previously been derived based on the known regulatory interactions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). It was shown that this network recapitulates the out-of-phase pattern between BMP/Wnt and Sox9 and forms a pattern with extremely low differential diffusivity requirements (<i>d</i> = 1.25). Our comprehensive mathematical analysis reveals that this three-node system is just another topology of the reaction-diffusion network that we analyzed for the extended Nodal/Lefty system; it is therefore a Type II network that can potentially form a pattern even when BMP and Wnt have equal diffusion coefficients. In previous studies, this observation was missed because the clearance rates of BMP and Wnt had been assumed to be identical (<a href=\"#bib61\">Raspopovic et al., 2014</a>). However, as we showed in the previous example for Nodal and Lefty, if BMP is cleared faster than Wnt, the diffusion ratio can be equal to or lower than one, <i>d \u2264</i> 1. The three-node BSW model recapitulates the out-of-phase pattern between BMP/Wnt and Sox9, but due to its high abstraction level it does not explain the opposite <i>BMP</i> expression and BMP activity patterns observed in the experimental data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). We therefore used RDNets to screen for more complex models with five nodes that represent all components of the network: two diffusible nodes for BMP (B) and Wnt (W) and three non-diffusible nodes, one for the canonical BMP pathway through pSmad1/5/8 (Sm), one for the intracellular Wnt signaling cascade (\u03b2-catenin, \u03b2), and one for Sox9 (S). We selected only networks that formed in-phase and out-of-phase patterns reflecting the experimental data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). Previous studies (<a href=\"#bib61\">Raspopovic et al., 2014</a>) showed that Sox9 is promoted by BMP signaling through pSmad1/5/8 and is inhibited by Wnt through \u03b2-catenin. Similar to the Nodal/Lefty example, we constrained the mathematical screen by incorporating these known regulatory interactions. Unexpectedly, the screen revealed that if \u03b2-catenin would directly inhibit Sox9, no network could recapitulate the out-of-phase patterns between <i>BMP</i> expression and BMP signaling. By performing a more general screen that left this interaction unconstrained, we found that the opposite <i>BMP</i> expression and signaling patterns can be obtained when \u03b2-catenin indirectly inhibits Sox9 through pSmad/1/5/8. RDNets also predicts that the most robust networks include the following additional interactions: i) a negative feedback from Sox9 to Wnt, ii) a negative feedback from pSmad1/5/8 to BMP, and iii) either a positive feedback from \u03b2-catenin to Sox9 or a negative feedback from \u03b2-catenin on Wnt (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>, gray arrows). Interestingly, the majority of networks identified by our screen was of Type III, suggesting that the proportion of Type III networks increases when more non-diffusible nodes are added."

We demonstrate the utility of RDNets by proposing an extension to an existing synthetic circuit for cell-cell communication in yeast (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen and Weiss, 2005</a>). The original synthetic circuit introduced a diffusible plant hormone, cytokinin isopentenyladenine (IP), and its receptor AtCRE1 into yeast (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). This circuit was used to implement a sender-receiver and a quorum sensing mechanism based on a positive feedback loop between IP-signaling and IP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). We used RDNets to identify possible signaling networks that can extend this positive feedback with additional interactions to form a reaction-diffusion pattern. Since at least two diffusible nodes are required to form a pattern (<a href=\"#bib49\">Murray, 2003</a>), we screened minimal 4-node networks that include the engineered positive feedback and candidate interactions with another diffusible node. In order to look for realistic and easily implementable signaling circuits, we explored only networks with interactions between diffusible nodes through non-diffusible factors representing intracellular signaling cascades. We also imposed self-regulations on diffusible nodes to be exclusively inhibitory, representing decay. With these constraints, our high-throughput analysis identified 16 minimal reaction-diffusion networks (5 Type I, 3 Type II, 8 Type III), of which the Type II and Type III networks were most robust to parameter changes (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the following, we demonstrate how the conditions derived by RDNets can be used to engineer the most simple and robust Type II network (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a> - right). In addition to the positive feedback loop, this network contains three additional negative feedbacks: two are self-regulations that correspond to decay, and one is a negative feedback between the newly introduced diffusible node and the non-diffusible node representing the receptor. This network suggests that a simple extension to the circuit developed in <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen and Weiss (2005)</a> could be obtained by a) destabilizing the signaling hormone and the receptor to increase their turn-over (<i>c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub></i>), and b) introducing another hormone that signals through the same receptor and implements a negative feedback loop to its own expression or activity (<i>c<sub>3</sub></i>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a> - right)."

Moreover, we assumed that the diffusion and decay rates are similar. With these constraints, RDNets determined that the newly introduced negative feedback has to be stronger than the positive feedback and decay rates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a> - right). This could be implemented using the more responsive IP-signaling promoter (TR-SSRE) developed in <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen and Weiss (2005)</a> to drive the expression of the inhibitor. This specific synthetic network represents only one possibility. We find other Type III networks to be even more robust to parameter changes, but they appear to require the design of more complex synthetic circuits (Appendix 4). Once a synthetic network is designed, RDNets can also be used to automatically derive kinetic models that can simulate the reaction-diffusion network (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d,e</a>,\u00a0Appendix 5). Numerical simulations can be used to investigate the qualitative aspect of the pattern and its spatial periodicity. In the long term, all these features open new avenues for designing synthetic reaction-diffusion circuits that could be coupled with gene expression to enable complex applications, such as fabrication of spatially patterned three-dimensional biomaterials and tissue engineering in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen and Weiss, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Carvalho et al., 2014</a>)."

Our approach is a new example of high-throughput mathematical analysis, which has several benefits over previous numerical approaches (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ma et al., 2009</a>). First, RDNets can be run from most web browsers and does not demand large computational power. Second, our mathematical analysis yields closed-form solutions and is complete, in contrast to numerical simulations that can necessarily only sample from a small region of the entire parameter space. Third, RDNets derives the conditions for pattern formation and therefore provides mechanistic explanatory power to the users. In addition, it helps to identify reaction-diffusion topologies that are in agreement with qualitative and quantitative experimental constraints, which makes it an unprecedented tool for users that aim to study developmental patterning networks or to design reaction-diffusion synthetic circuits."

Our analytical approach is both comprehensive and informative and reveals that depending on the network topology, reaction-diffusion systems can belong to three classes: Type I systems that require differential diffusivity, Type II systems that can form patterns with equal diffusivity, and Type III systems that form patterns independent of specific diffusion rates. In particular, the novel class of Type III networks has not been described before and challenges models of short-range activation and long-range inhibition based on differential diffusivity that have dominated the field of developmental and theoretical biology for decades (see Appendix 3 for details)."

By using quantitative data to constrain possible patterning networks, we found a Type II and a Type III topology that extend the Nodal/Lefty activator-inhibitor system with realistic cell-autonomous signaling. In such extended networks, Nodal and Lefty do not necessarily need to have different diffusivities to form a pattern. However, our results suggest that the differential diffusivity can contribute to a more robust patterning system in Type II networks with indirect Nodal signaling inhibition. We propose that the high general robustness of the Type III network might have played a role for the evolution of the Nodal/Lefty reaction-diffusion system in the first place, and that the indirect Nodal signaling inhibition of Type II networks might have been fine-tuned during evolution (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly, we extended the three-node BSW digit patterning model with additional previously characterized cell-autonomous factors and constrained a five-node model with qualitative data. Our analysis identified realistic network topologies that accurately reflect the previously puzzling opposite pattern of BMP ligands and BMP signaling and predicts novel interactions between network components."

Identifying a comprehensive catalog of gene networks that can perform a certain behavior has been shown to be a successful strategy to uncover the design space of stripe-forming networks (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cotterell and Sharpe, 2010</a>), which can be directly useful to synthetic biology. In particular, this approach permitted a whole family of network mechanisms to be synthetically constructed in bacteria \u2013 all capable of forming a gene expression stripe in a bacterial lawn (<a href=\"#bib67\">Schaerli et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, our software provides a comprehensive catalog of reaction-diffusion networks and enables bioengineers to explore new mechanisms to form periodic spatial patterns in a robust manner. These networks explicitly include non-diffusible factors that mediate signaling and are easy to relate with sender-receiver synthetic toolkits (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barcena Menendez et al., 2015</a>). In addition, we found that the majority of realistic reaction-diffusion networks eliminate the differential diffusivity requirement that is difficult to implement synthetically (<a href=\"#bib5\">Carvalho et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barcena Menendez et al., 2015</a>). The possibility to use qualitative and quantitative constraints to screen for reaction-diffusion networks makes RDNets a unique tool to customize patterning systems from initial starting networks. Moreover, the pattern-forming conditions derived by the software can be used to estimate parameter ranges and network robustness. Particularly promising is our finding that each network is associated with a set of topologies that exhaustively determine all the in-phase and out-of-phase relations between periodic patterns (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). It is therefore possible to design network topologies that promote the co-localized expression of any desired combination of factors. This will enable novel applications in tissue engineering, where the co-localized expression of differentiating factors can be used to induce specific tissues (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kaplan et al., 2005</a>). Coupled with the three-dimensional pattern-forming capabilities of reaction-diffusion mechanisms (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>), this could be used to devise new strategies for engineering scaffolds or tissues with complex architecture."

RDNets requires only the installation of the freely available Wolfram CDF player plugin (<a href=\"http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/\">http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/</a>). A simple graphical interface can be used to specify inputs and constraints and to run the high-throughput mathematical analysis. Constraints can be specified by clicking on the nodes or edges of the networks, or by providing specific values for the corresponding parameters (see User Guide available at <a href=\"http://www.RDNets.com\">http://www.RDNets.com</a>). These constraints are automatically translated into mathematical formulae that are coupled with the symbolic linear stability analysis performed by the computer algebra system. The graphical user interface can be used to explore and simulate the list of reaction-diffusion topologies given as output of the linear stability analysis. Additional constraints can be progressively added to the analysis to refresh the output and to narrow down the list of candidate topologies (see User Guide available at <a href=\"http://www.RDNets.com\">http://www.RDNets.com</a>)."

This can be done by rewriting the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial in terms of cycles of the graph associated with the reaction matrix.

In addition, given the explicit representation of cell-autonomous factors, these networks also suggest at which level of the signaling pathways the new feedbacks should be introduced. On the\u00a0one hand, these predictions help to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real systems, and on the other hand they present engineers with new challenges for the implementation of specific synthetic network designs.

In particular, we analyze one of the highly robust Type III networks identified by RDNets (highlighted in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This network requires the addition of three negative feedback loops: one corresponding to the decay of the ligand involved in the positive feedback (<math id=\"inf394\"><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>), one implementing a negative feedback between the ligand and its signaling (<math id=\"inf395\"><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></math>), and another feedback between an additional ligand and its signaling (<math id=\"inf396\"><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>, <a href=\"#fig30\">Appendix 4\u2014figure 1b</a>). Strikingly, this Type III network has very simple pattern forming requirements (<a href=\"#fig30\">Appendix 4\u2014figure 1c</a>): To guarantee stability, <math id=\"inf397\"><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math> has to be greater than the other negative feedback, and the strength of the positive feedback\u00a0<math id=\"inf398\"><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>4</mn></msub></math> has to be small. The network does not have special requirements for the instability, which is intrinsically guaranteed by the Type III network topology. A comparison between the original network that implemented the positive feedback (<a href=\"#fig30\">Appendix 4\u2014figure 1a</a>) and this candidate topology (<a href=\"#fig30\">Appendix 4\u2014figure 1b</a>) reveals that two of the new feedbacks could be implemented simply by increasing the turn-over rate of IP (<math id=\"inf399\"><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>) and by implementing a negative feedback between IP-signaling and its own expression or activity (<math id=\"inf400\"><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></math>). The third feedback (<math id=\"inf401\"><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>), however, implies a more complex synthetic design: in this case, another ligand that signals through an independent receptor should be introduced. Moreover, the signaling of the new ligand should implement a negative feedback on its own expression or activity that is mediated by components of the signaling pathway of IP (z). This last requirement is more challenging to implement since it requires to design a signaling pathway component of IP that can simultaneously promote IP and inhibit the new ligand. The sharing of this component is an intrinsic requirement of the model and guarantees the coupling between the two signaling pathways. The simple addition of a downstream target of IP that independently inhibits the new ligand does not represent an equivalent implementation. A possible common element that could fulfill this design is a factor that mediates the secretion of IP but also the produces an inhibitor of the new ligand. This factor, which in the model corresponds to z, would have to be promoted by both signaling pathways."

However, we find that by just altering the magnitude of the rates associated with cycle c3 (without modifying the overall strength of c<sub>3</sub> or D<sub>w</sub>/c<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>v</sub>/c<sub>1</sub>), the final aspect of the periodic patterns can change, such that v \u2013 surprisingly \u2013 appears to have a longer range than w (<a href=\"#fig18\">Appendix 3\u2014figure 2</a>). Moreover, the definition of ranges in terms of ratios between diffusion and decay cannot be generalized to other Type II networks that lack negative self-regulatory feedbacks of the diffusible molecules (e.g. <a href=\"#fig19\">Appendix 3\u2014figure 3</a>) or where the minimum diffusion ratio d is defined by more complicated reaction terms (e.g. equation 31 in Appendix 3)."

Moreover, for other Type III networks, alternative ad hoc approximations of the effective ranges would need to be defined in order to interpret the systems within the LALI framework.

Turing\u2019s original simulation highlights that the role of differential diffusivity is not to limit the expansion of the activator but to destabilize the equilibrium state by maintaining an imbalance between reactants that drives a continuous deviation from equilibrium. Importantly, the reaction terms of a Turing system guarantee that the deviation happens simultaneously above and below the equilibrium state. In agreement with these observations, one-dimensional simulations like the one shown in Appendix 6\u2014figure 8 reveal that the periodic patterns of Turing systems are formed with a simultaneous appearance of activation and inhibition peaks. The periodic patterns therefore do not reflect a longer range of the inhibitor to limit the auto-activation."

This eliminates the need to examine all RH determinants over the entire range of wave numbers.
