We investigate here the biochemical properties of the <i>E. coli</i> RadA protein and several mutant forms. RadA is a DNA-dependent ATPase, a DNA binding protein and can stimulate the branch migration phase of RecA-mediated strand transfer reactions. RadA cannot mediate synaptic pairing between homologous DNA molecules but can drive branch migration to extend the region of heteroduplex DNA, even without RecA. Unlike other branch migration factors RecG and RuvAB, RadA stimulates branch migration within the context of the RecA filament, in the direction of RecA-mediated strand exchange. We propose that RadA-mediated branch migration aids recombination by allowing the 3' invading strand to be incorporated into heteroduplex DNA and to be extended by DNA polymerases."
