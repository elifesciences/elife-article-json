The DC lineage is divided into several subtypes based on transcription factor requirements, surface markers and ability to prime CD4 vs CD8 T cell responses. By surface phenotype, the spleen contains three major populations of conventional DCs: CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and double negative (DN) DCs (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shortman and Liu, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hashimoto et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Miller et al., 2012</a>). CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs also express the C-type lectin receptor called DC-inhibitory receptor 2 (DCIR2), identified by the antibody 33D1, whereas CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs express the lectin DEC205 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dudziak et al., 2007</a>). Lymph nodes (LNs) contain these DC populations but also contain additional subsets that travel to these organs from peripheral tissues sites (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hashimoto et al., 2011</a>). Based on soluble antigen immunization studies and antigen targeting to DC subtypes using antibodies, as well as studies in mice deficient in DC subsets, CD4<sup>+</sup> and DN DCs have been most strongly implicated in priming CD4 T cell responses against exogenous antigens whereas CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs have a more prominent role in cross-presenting antigens and promoting CD8 T cell responses (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pooley et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dudziak et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hildner et al., 2008</a>). However, these functional distinctions are not strict with some studies, for example, suggesting that CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs contribute to priming of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tamura et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fukaya et al., 2012</a>)."

Blood entering the spleen is released at the marginal sinus prior to travelling through the marginal zone in a direction away from the lymphoid (white pulp) regions, into the red pulp to return to circulation via venous sinuses. The CD4<sup>+</sup> 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs in the spleen are enriched in an area of the white pulp known as the marginal zone (MZ) bridging channel, where the T zone abuts the blood-rich red pulp (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mitchell, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Witmer and Steinman, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Steinman et al., 1997</a>).

In the spleen, CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs are enriched in MZ bridging channels, specialized interfollicular regions that connect the T zone with the red-pulp (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mitchell, 1973</a>). Locating DCs in tissue sections by staining for CD4 is problematic due to the large abundance of CD4 T cells. We therefore took advantage of the DC restricted expression of DCIR2, detected with 33D1 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Witmer and Steinman, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dudziak et al., 2007</a>), for this assessment. Strikingly, while 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs were concentrated in bridging channels of control mice, they were markedly under represented in these regions in EBI2-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Although the total number of 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs in the sections was reduced, consistent with the reduced cell numbers detected by flow cytometry, the 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs that remained were mostly distributed in the red pulp or in the T zone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

Splenic DCs are short-lived (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kamath et al., 2002</a>) and their viability can be prolonged by removal of the proapoptotic molecule Bim (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2007</a>).

However, EBI2-deficient mice contained normal numbers of pre-DCs in BM and spleen (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). To test whether splenic pre-DC that had developed in the absence of EBI2 signaling retained normal developmental potential we took advantage of the finding that transfers of pre-DCs into congenically marked recipient animals gives rise to small but traceable numbers of CD4, CD8 and DN DCs 6 days later (<a href=\"#bib35\">Naik et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liu et al., 2007</a>). When WT pre-DCs were transferred to <i>Cyp7b1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> recipients, the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs generated was reduced, consistent with the need for EBI2 ligand to sustain these DCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). By contrast, when <i>Cyp7b1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> pre-DCs were transferred to wild-type recipients, normal numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs were generated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). These data demonstrate that <i>Cyp7b1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> spleens contain a normal compartment of pre-DCs and indicate that EBI2 is required in DCs after their differentiation to a CD4<sup>+</sup> state. In further support of this conclusion, when sorted congenically distinguishable and violet tracer labeled pre-DCs from <i>Ebi2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> and <i>Ebi2</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> mice were cotransferred into wild-type hosts, fewer <i>Ebi2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs were detectable 6 days later but these cells appeared to have divided a similar number of times as the control cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

In previous work we found that when mice lacked LT\u03b11\u03b22 not only were CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs reduced in number, but the level of LT\u03b2R on the cells was elevated, consistent with less ligand-mediated down-modulation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kabashima et al., 2005</a>).

To explore this idea we injected mice intravenously with sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) that had been labeled with the membrane dye, PKH26 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hagnerud et al., 2006</a>). 1 day later, flow cytometric analysis revealed marked capture of PKH26<sup>+</sup> antigen by splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs whereas capture by CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs was considerably lower (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). A similar extent of antigen capture by CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs was evident as early as 30 min after SRBC injection and PKH26<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs were still evident in the spleen at 48 hr (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Analysis of tissue sections from mice 30 min after injection of PKH26-labeled SRBC and fluorescent CD11c antibody showed the expected high density of SRBC throughout the MZ (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hagnerud et al., 2006</a>), including in regions overlapping with clusters of CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Previous work has shown that bridging channel DCs move into the T zone in response to LPS exposure (<a href=\"#bib10\">De Becker et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">De Trez et al., 2005</a>) but it has been unclear whether this occurs upon immunization with other antigen types. Remarkably, SRBC injection led to very rapid movement of 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs from bridging channels to the T zone, with a notable bias for positioning at the B-T zone interface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The cells remained in this location for 1 day, but by 2 days the distribution of 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs resembled more closely the unstimulated state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Interestingly, the inward movement of 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs following SRBC immunization occurred more rapidly than following injection with LPS and with a greater bias for the T-B boundary (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Confirming the importance of bridging channel positioning in favoring access to blood-borne antigen, when mice were pretreated with unlabeled SRBCs for 6 hr to promote DC movement in to the T zone and then injected with PKH26<sup>+</sup> SRBC, the extent of PKH26<sup>+</sup> antigen capture by CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs was selectively diminished (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

By contrast, EBI2 expression and function was minimally affected following SRBC injection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a> and not shown). When mice were reconstituted with a mixture of CCR7-deficient and EBI2-deficient BM such that the majority of CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs were CCR7-deficient while most other cell types were CCR7 wild-type, injection of SRBC failed to cause DC mobilization from MZ bridging channels to the T-B boundary (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), confirming the role of CCR7 in this repositioning event."

The above findings establish a crucial role for EBI2 and its oxysterol ligand, 7\u03b1,25-OHC, in positioning CD4<sup>+</sup> 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs in MZ bridging channels and in LN interfollicular regions. EBI2 is also required for the maintenance of a CD4<sup>+</sup> 33D1<sup>+</sup> DC compartment of normal size. These roles of EBI2 in DCs are necessary for supporting normal CD4 T cell and B cell proliferative responses, and early plasma cell and germinal center responses to particulate blood-borne antigens. These observations are in close agreement with a study that appeared online at the time this work was submitted (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gatto et al., 2013</a>). Our study additionally provides evidence that EBI2-mediated positioning of CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs in splenic MZ bridging channels promotes two important processes: (1) encounter with B cell-derived LT\u03b11\u03b22 that engages the DC LT\u03b2R, delivering a signal necessary for maintaining the homeostasis of the population; and, (2) efficient exposure to blood-borne particulate antigens and an ability to promptly access the T-B zone interface to stimulate T-dependent B cell responses (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

EBI2 ligand is suggested to be produced in high amounts in the MZ bridging channel by stromal cells (not depicted) and acts to promote positioning of EBI2<sup>hi</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs (that are also 33D1<sup>+</sup>) in this region. This in turn juxtaposes them to MZ and follicular B cells, resulting in exposure to B cell-derived LT\u03b11\u03b22 (not depicted). LT\u03b2R engagement on the DC transmits a homeostasis-promoting signal. This positioning also exposes the cells to particulate antigens traveling with blood flow through the marginal sinus and the MZ. Following particulate antigen exposure, DCs migrate in a CCR7-dependent manner from the bridging channel in to the T zone where they present antigen to helper T cells."

The alternative possibility that EBI2 is providing a maintenance signal that is independent of its positioning role seems unlikely as <i>Hsd3b7</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice with elevated 7\u03b1,25-OHC would not be expected to have the same defect in EBI2 signaling as mice that lack 7\u03b1,25-OHC.

The basis for our inability to observe a statistically significant reduction in DC turnover in EBI2-deficient mice is not clear but may indicate that the cells continue to receive low level LT\u03b2R engagement. Precisely how a reduction in LT\u03b2R engagement leads to a decrease in CD4<sup>+</sup> DC numbers needs further investigation. The sufficiency of increased EBI2 expression to lead to greater numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs may be a consequence of increased LT\u03b2R signaling since increased LT\u03b2R engagement is adequate to increase CD4 DC numbers (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kabashima et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Wang et al., 2005</a>). To account for our inability to observe changes in the CD4<sup>+</sup> DC turnover rate or rescuing effects of antagonizing apoptosis when EBI2 function was lacking, we suggest that CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs are lost in EBI2-deficient mice at a similar rate irrespective of how long it has been since they were generated from pre-DCs or last proliferated. It seems possible that the cells suffer from the combined effect of mispositioning due to EBI2-deficiency and lack of expression of molecules downstream of LT\u03b2R signaling that control interactions with other cell types, with the outcome that the CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs are more frequently engulfed by phagocytes or become caught in blood flow and lost from the spleen. In this regard, it is notable that mice lacking CD47 or its partner protein SIRP\u03b1, have a similar deficiency in splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hagnerud et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Van et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Saito et al., 2010</a>). Although we did not observe alterations in CD47 or SIRP\u03b1 expression by DCs in EBI2-deficient mice (T. Yi and J. Cyster, unpublished observation), it is possible that the function of these molecules in mediating cell\u2013cell interactions or in regulating engulfment by phagocytic cells is somehow altered in EBI2-deficient DCs."

We provide evidence that one reason for this differing dependence on EBI2 is that particulate antigen is not able to freely access DCs already positioned within the T zone. This finding is consistent with other studies showing an inverse relationship between the size of molecules and their ability to diffusively access the white pup (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nolte et al., 2003</a>). The intact response of EBI2-deficient mice to 33D1-Ova was unexpected but suggests that the defective response to SRBC-antigen is not solely a consequence of reduced CD4<sup>+</sup> DC numbers. Instead, these data suggest that appropriate positioning in MZ bridging channels, and thus in close proximity to the marginal sinus and blood-rich MZ, is critical for supporting the response against particulate antigens. This requirement might reflect both the improved efficiency with which DCs in this region can capture blood-borne particles and the ability to be triggered for rapid movement into the T zone (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Although 33D1 coupling ensured efficient delivery of antigen to CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs it did not promote their movement into the T zone (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chappell et al., 2012</a> and data not shown)."

However, a recent report showed that when antigen was targeted to 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs as an antibody conjugate, it promoted some B cell activation events in a manner that did not depend on T cell help (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chappell et al., 2012</a>). A number of studies have shown that DCs can directly augment B cell responses (<a href=\"#bib31\">MacPherson et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Balazs et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jego et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Qi et al., 2006</a>). Our finding that 33D1<sup>+</sup> DCs move to the B-T zone interface following particulate antigen immunization also seems consistent with the possibility that these DCs interact with activated B cells as well as T cells. Future studies will be needed to determine whether EBI2-dependent DC\u2013B cell interactions contribute to driving early B cell activation events during responses to particulate antigens."

The less effective induction of ICOS and PD1 on T cells responding to SRBC-Ova in EBI2-deficient hosts suggests that antigen presentation by CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs may be important in favoring induction of an early B-helper phenotype in CD4 T cells. In addition to efficiently presenting antigen in the context of MHC class II (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pooley et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dudziak et al., 2007</a>) it is possible that appropriately activated CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs bias T cell differentiation in a manner that favors provision of B cell help. Consistent with early induction of Tfh cell properties in activated T cells augmenting B cell responses, when T cells lack the \u2018master regulator\u2019 of Tfh cell differentiation, Bcl6, they are poorly able to support extrafollicular plasmablast responses (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2011</a>).

Under homeostatic conditions, EBI2 has a dominant influence and promotes positioning in MZ bridging channels. However, following activation by antigen exposure the balance shifts in favor of CCR7 and the cells move promptly into the T zone (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). While we suggest that direct exposure to antigen triggers DC movement, we do not exclude the possibility that CCR7 upregulation is promoted indirectly as a consequence of cytokine production by other antigen-exposed cells. The basis for the antigen activated DCs favoring the B-T zone interface compared to the central T zone is not yet clear but this does not seem to depend on EBI2 expression. These data add to a series of findings showing how differential responsiveness to chemoattractants emanating from adjacent zones determines cell position (<a href=\"#bib41\">Reif et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cyster, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bromley et al., 2008</a>). Although LPS causes CCR7 upregulation on splenic DCs and promotes their movement to the T zone (<a href=\"#bib10\">De Becker et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">De Trez et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Seul et al., 2012</a>) we found that LPS-mediated repositioning happened more slowly and with a more uniform distribution of DCs through the T zone than occurred following SRBC immunization. The DC sensor triggered following SRBC immunization is not clear but in preliminary experiments we do not find a requirement for Myd88 (unpublished observation). SRBCs rapidly become opsonized by complement and presumably also by natural antibody and it is possible that these factors contribute to SRBC capture by CD4<sup>+</sup> DCs and to triggering CCR7 upregulation. It seems possible that detection of damaged endogenous RBCs may be a trigger for DC maturation as a number of important pathogens, most notably the malaria parasite, propagate inside RBCs, insert foreign proteins in their membranes and alter their functional properties."

BM cells were spin-infected twice with a retroviral construct expressing EBI2 or truncated nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) and an IRES\u2013truncated human CD4 cassette as a reporter. 1 day after the last spin infection, hCD4 positive cells were FACS sorted and injected into lethally irradiated C57BL/6 recipients. Around 50% of the hematopoietic cells in recipients were hCD4 positive 6 weeks after reconstitution."

However, we found that this approach was problematic as the DT treatment caused almost complete ablation of plasma cells and GC B cells derived from the CD11c-DTR BM (Author response image 1A). This effect is consistent with past and very recent findings that CD11c-DTR (and CD11c-YFP) is expressed in plasmablasts and GC B cells (Hebel et al., 2006 Eur J Immunol 36, 2912; Racine et al., 2008 J Immunol 181, 1375; Baumjohann et al., 2013 Immunity 38, 596). While this approach did not allow us to examine the impact of selective EBI2-deficiency in DCs on WT B-lineage cells, the experiment did allow assessment of the response of EBI2- deficient B cells in mice that lack EBI2 on CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs while retaining EBI2 on approximately half of all non-CD11c expressing cells (such as helper T cells). This analysis showed the plasma cell response was reduced 3-fold and the GC response about 2.5-fold compared to the response in control CD11c-DTR:WT mixed BM chimeras (Author response image 1B). This reduction was greater than observed for EBI2- deficient B cells in SRBC immunized Ebi2<sup>-/-</sup>:WT mixed BM chimeras, where the plasma cell response was reduced only 25% and the GC response was not reduced (Author response image 1C). The greater defect in the DT treated Ebi2<sup>-/-</sup>:CD11c-DTR chimeras is consistent with a role for EBI2<sup>+</sup> DC in supporting events necessary for the polyclonal anti-SRBC plasma cell and GC responses."

Immunol. 2013, advanced online), that includes data showing the endogenous GC response to SRBC is reduced in mice conditionally deficient for EBI2 in CD11c-Cre expressing cells. Since EBI2 is minimally expressed in GC B cells, their data are most consistent with the reduced polyclonal GC B cell response being due to an EBI2 requirement in CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs."
