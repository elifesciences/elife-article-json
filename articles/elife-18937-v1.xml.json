In previous work (Hunt et al., 2015), we argued that PFC correlates of chosen value are a consequence of varying rates of a dynamical evidence accumulation process. Yet within PFC, there is substantial variability in chosen value correlates across individual neurons. Here we show that this variability is explained by neurons having different temporal receptive fields of integration, indexed by examining neuronal spike rate autocorrelation structure whilst at rest. We find that neurons with protracted resting temporal receptive fields exhibit stronger chosen value correlates during choice. Within orbitofrontal cortex, these neurons also sustain coding of chosen value from choice through the delivery of reward, providing a potential neural mechanism for maintaining predictions and updating stored values during learning. These findings reveal that within PFC, variability in temporal specialisation across neurons predicts involvement in specific decision-making computations."

In previous work (Hunt et al., 2015), we argued that PFC correlates of chosen value are a consequence of varying rates of a dynamical evidence accumulation process. Yet within PFC, there is substantial variability in chosen value correlates across individual neurons. Here we show that this variability is explained by neurons having different temporal receptive fields of integration, indexed by examining neuronal spike rate autocorrelation structure whilst at rest. We find that neurons with protracted resting temporal receptive fields exhibit stronger chosen value correlates during choice. Within orbitofrontal cortex, these neurons also sustain coding of chosen value from choice through the delivery of reward, providing a potential neural mechanism for maintaining predictions and updating stored values during learning. These findings reveal that within PFC, variability in temporal specialisation across neurons predicts involvement in specific decision-making computations."

One widely studied class of evidence accumulation models are cortical attractor networks, originally derived from studies of working memory (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amit and Brunel, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang, 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">2002</a>). These rely upon strong recurrent connections between similarly tuned neurons to integrate evidence across time, and exhibit temporally extended persistent activity that stores the outcome of the decision process in memory (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wang, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wong and Wang, 2006</a>). In value-guided decision making tasks, attractor network models predict the emergence of correlates of chosen value during choice (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hunt et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rustichini and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015</a>). These value correlates result from varying speeds of decision formation across different trials, an issue we explored closely in our previous paper (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hunt et al., 2015</a>). However, in contrast to the relative homogeneity of chosen value correlates within such models, it is known that decision correlates are highly <i>heterogeneous</i> across different cells within a given region (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kennerley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wallis and Kennerley, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Meister et al., 2013</a>). The source and functional significance of this neuronal heterogeneity remains unclear."

The temporal receptive field of a neuron can be established by examining its spike-count autocorrelation function (ACF) at rest (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ogawa and Komatsu, 2010</a>). A slowly decaying ACF whilst at rest reflects temporal stability in firing, suggesting that the neuron integrates information across long periods of time; by contrast, a fast-decaying ACF reflects temporal variability in firing. Recently, this approach was used to demonstrate a hierarchy of temporal receptive fields across areas of cortex (<a href=\"#bib37\">Murray et al., 2014</a>), with populations of neurons in lower and higher cortical areas exhibiting brief and extended temporal receptive fields, respectively. Those areas with temporally extended receptive fields thus appear intrinsically adapted to cognitive tasks involving extended integration of information across time, such as working memory and decision making (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mazurek et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wang, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chaudhuri et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). Yet in addition to the\u00a0heterogeneity of temporal fields <i>across</i> regions, similar heterogeneity is also evident <i>within</i> cortical areas (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ogawa and Komatsu, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nishida et al., 2014</a>). It remains unknown whether this intra-regional heterogeneity in temporal specialisation might predict the computations served by different neurons in decision-making tasks."

A corollary of this idea is that neurons functionally specialised to perform temporally extended computations (such as evidence accumulation) might exhibit stronger chosen value correlates during choice. We hypothesised that this would be indexed by measuring individual neurons\u2019 temporal receptive fields whilst at rest. We also hypothesised that this functional specialisation might support other temporally extended computations during reward-guided choice, such as the maintenance of value coding until reward delivery. This could be one component of a mechanism for credit assignment in learning, which is known to rely upon PFC and in particular orbitofrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib60\">Walton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Takahashi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chau et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jocham et al., 2016</a>), with the other component being a representation of the chosen stimulus identity, which is also encoded by OFC neurons (<a href=\"#bib45\">Raghuraman and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib31\">Lopatina et al., 2015</a>).

During choice, chosen value correlates were remarkably similar across all three PFC brain regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)) at the population level (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

We first sought to visually identify a potential relationship with chosen value by sorting the matrices in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> by time constant. To maximise our sensitivity, and because of the similarity in chosen value correlates across PFC brain regions at choice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), we collapsed this analysis across all three PFC regions (n = 446 neurons). We found that more neurons with high chosen value coefficient of partial determination (CPD) were more\u00a0apparent at the bottom of the sorted matrix than at the top (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), implying a relationship between chosen value coding and resting \u03c4. To test this relationship statistically, neurons were subdivided into high and low time constant populations using a median split (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The population with a higher \u03c4 (more stable activity at rest) had more variance explained by chosen value during choice (permutation test (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), p=0.0298). We further demonstrated this relationship by performing a rank correlation between each neuron\u2019s coefficient of partial determination (CPD) at the time of the maximum population-average CPD with its time constant (Correlation Coefficient = 0.148, p=0.0018; 95% CI [0.0556, 0.2373], <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Although this was largely the case, a degree of chosen value coding persisted until reward outcome, particularly within OFC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Within OFC, we found that persistent coding of chosen value from choice to outcome was more evident within the high \u03c4 neuronal population than within the low \u03c4 population, particularly during the experience of reward delivery (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; permutation test at time of outcome (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), p=0.0082).

The OFC neuronal population code was also persistent across time during this epoch (warm <i>off-</i>diagonal elements in top left quadrant of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), and even more so during the outcome epoch (warm off-diagonal elements in bottom right quadrant of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This sustained activity reflects the notion that dynamical decision processes within the OFC population may take place over several hundreds of milliseconds. Crucially, however, there was also evidence for sustained coding: the <i>same</i> neuronal population in OFC at choice encoded chosen value from at least 1000\u00a0ms before outcome through to 1000\u00a0ms after outcome (warm colours in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, grey and black dashed boxes, permutation tests (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), largest clusters p&lt;0.0001); such sustained coding of value from choice through outcome was absent within DLPFC (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and ACC (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) neuronal populations. Within OFC, this sustained population code appeared most prominent in the neurons with a high resting time constant \u03c4 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), but absent in those with a low \u03c4 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Note, however, that this difference should be interpreted cautiously, as a formal comparison of cluster size within the high and low \u03c4 populations (using a non-parametric permutation test, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) was not significant (p=0.59). Nonetheless, the sustained population code from choice through outcome was much stronger in OFC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013C</a>) than in both the ACC and DLPFC populations (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">2</a>; permutation tests, OFC v DLPFC, p=0008; OFC v ACC, p&lt;0.0001; see Materials and methods). This demonstrates that OFC neurons with persistent activity at rest encode a 'sustained' representation of chosen value until an expected outcome is experienced, and that this neural signature appears unique to OFC."

These include complex pyramidal cell morphology, strong reciprocal connections, slow-decaying NMDA-Receptor transmission and augmenting synapses (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wang, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Elston, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Freeman, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). These factors may account for both the prolonged resting stability within PFC, and the ability of its neurons to support computations that subserve flexible cognition (<a href=\"#bib36\">Miller et al., 1996</a>). However, there are different cell-classes within the PFC, with substantial heterogeneity in their morphology, synapses and expression of slow-decaying NMDA-Receptors (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wong and Wang, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Zaitsev et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). When randomly sampling neurons within the macaque PFC, the morphology, cell-type, cortical layer and synaptic features are unknown. Recorded neurons are therefore likely sampled from separate subnetworks with differing resting stabilities and distinct roles in cognitive processing (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). This may explain the heterogeneity we observed in both resting activity and involvement in decision making computations observed across PFC neurons. Recent evidence has shown diversity in functional responses of PFC neurons dependent upon the cell-type and cortical layer in which they were located (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pinto and Dan, 2015</a>)."

Following on from our previous work (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hunt et al., 2015</a>) \u2013 where we demonstrated that chosen value correlates can arise indirectly from the dynamics of decision processes \u2013 our result implies that neurons with more persistent resting activity are more involved in value-based choice. This provides new experimental evidence to support computational theories which attribute evidence integration to strongly recurrent attractor networks (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wang, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wong and Wang, 2006</a>). Neurons located within these reverberant PFC subnetworks would be expected to have both higher time constants and stronger value correlates. It also indicates that such models need refinement if they are to encompass the heterogeneous correlates of decisions varaiables that we and others have observed (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kennerley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Meister et al., 2013</a>). Our findings facilitate several testable predictions for research into single-neuron mechanisms of decision making. For perceptual decisions, such as the random dot-motion task, which involve the integration of evidence over time more explicitly than our cost-benefit decision paradigm, we would predict task-related neurons would also have high time constants (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>)."

Our data showing that evidence maintenance is indeed fulfilled by neurons with higher time constants concurs with this hypothesis.

Indeed, there is a large body of evidence suggesting OFC signals outcome expectancies (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rangel and Hare, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schoenbaum et al., 2010</a>). However, despite ideas that OFC is critical for credit assignment during learning, we are not aware of any study that has demonstrated what a neuronal signature of credit assignment might resemble. Here we show that OFC neurons with high temporal specializations not only encode an integrated chosen value signal during choice, but that the same OFC neurons maintain this representation through to the experience of an outcome. This neural signature - when combined with a representation of the chosen stimulus identity, which is also encoded in OFC (<a href=\"#bib45\">Raghuraman and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib31\">Lopatina et al., 2015</a>) - could be a key computation for credit assignment processes."

Our findings therefore have important implications for how neurophysiological datasets are collected and analysed. One current method of avoiding variability in neuronal responses during cognitive tasks is pre-selection of neurons based upon their response properties; neurons with stable, persistent responses on memory guided saccade tasks are preferentially selected for analysis in decision-making tasks (<a href=\"#bib47\">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yang and Shadlen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mante et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kira et al., 2015</a>). This method may lead investigators to record from neurons with longer temporal receptive fields, as evidenced (<a href=\"#bib37\">Murray et al., 2014</a>) by the higher population-level time constants within the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) when neurons are screened prior to recording (<a href=\"#bib14\">Freedman and Assad, 2006</a>) versus when they are not (<a href=\"#bib52\">Seo et al., 2009</a>). A more unbiased characterisation of the heterogeneity of neuronal responses may be obtained by recording from all encountered neurons and categorising them post-hoc, as is more common practice in PFC studies (<a href=\"#bib15\">Freedman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kennerley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hanks et al., 2015</a>). In the context of decision-making, this has highlighted several \u2018non-classical\u2019 neuronal response profiles in regions such as LIP (<a href=\"#bib35\">Meister et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, even in spite of pre-screening neurons prior to the task, substantial heterogeneity in task-related responses can nonetheless remain (<a href=\"#bib44\">Premereur et al., 2011</a>).

In addition to the data lost due to incomplete trials, previous investigators have excluded a further proportion of trials due to the drifting resting firing rate of neurons over the course of a session (<a href=\"#bib37\">Murray et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nishida et al., 2014</a>). As we intended to assign time constants to individual neurons, we decided that estimating autocorrelation from a restricted trial number would not provide the best estimation of spike-count autocorrelation. However, it is possible our method artificially inflated autocorrelation due to drifting firing rates throughout a session. Therefore, as a control analysis, we filtered trials when firing rates drifted, using the same approach as in (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nishida et al., 2014</a>). For each neuron, the total spike count during the fixation period of each trial was calculated. A sliding window of these spike counts for 100 trials was subdivided into 4 groups of 25 trials and entered into a Kruskal-Wallis test. By shifting this sliding window from the 1st to the last trial within a session, we obtained the longest sequence of trials in which activity did not differ significantly (p&gt;0.005). This procedure reduced the number of trials used for estimating the autocorrelation function on average by 38.4%. When comparing the population level fits to data using the method reported above, very similar time constants were obtained (compare <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> versus <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

The black dashed area of the cross-temporal population correlation matrices of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure\u00a0supplement\u00a01A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement\u00a02A</a> were extracted. For each pair of brain areas, the cross-temporal correlation coefficients at each corresponding pixel were compared using Fisher\u2019s r-to-Z transformation. All pixels which had correlation coefficients which were significantly different between brain areas (with an uncorrected p&lt;0.01) were highlighted. Any area of interconnecting pixels was defined as a true cluster. The largest area of interconnecting pixels was identified and defined as the \u2018Largest True Difference Cluster\u2019. The assignment of neurons to brain areas was then shuffled and the analysis repeated 10,000 times to produce a null distribution of Difference Cluster sizes, against which the true cluster size was compared. The test was performed independently for OFC v DLPFC, OFC v ACC and DLPFC v ACC."

In particular, they found that neurons in the ACC and OFC with longer time constants during fixation (as measured by spike rate autocorrelation) are more likely to encode chosen value signals. Moreover, OFC neurons tended to encode the chosen value signals more strongly during the outcome period compared to the neurons in the DLPFC and ACC. The cross temporal correlation analysis also revealed that the chosen value coding in the OFC during the choice and outcome epochs was consistent. The authors suggested that this might be important for the proposed role of the OFC in resolving temporal credit assignment."

However, it doesn't look like tau values fall into discrete high and low clusters (there's no apparent discontinuity at the median in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, right-hand side). The rank correlation test mentioned in the third paragraph of the Results seems like a much more natural approach. What's the justification for not using the rank correlation for all the analyses, i.e. the tests of the entire time course, of individual brain regions, and of the outcome phase? As it stands the correlation analysis is confined to a single time point, and the criterion for choosing this time point is vague (\"maximal population response\"). Does this mean (1) maximum spike rate, (2) maximum population-average CPD, or (<a href=\"#bib3\">3</a>) maximum high-versus-low effect in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>? #1 seems like the most natural reading, but #2 is what I would guess given the context (#3 would be circular)."

In our study, such a \u2018stimulus identity\u2019 code would be inherently confounded with value, so we do not believe it could be isolated from this dataset. Nevertheless, recent studies (Lopatinaet al., 2015) have demonstrated that single OFC neurons can encode specific stimuli or stimulus-outcome relationships, so it appears plausible that both a stimulus-specific code and a sustained chosen value code could be utilized across the OFC population to support both choice and credit assignment processes."

However, we interpret this finding in a similar way to the \u2018prescient\u2019 pre-stimulus activity observed in (Padoa-Schioppa, 2013). In particular, the firing rate of neurons before trial onset may affect the success of the network in making decisions, and so induce correlations with chosen value pre-stimulus. This is indeed apparent in the analyses of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, where there is chosen value coding that is slightly higher than chance, pre-stimulus, across all three regions.

We also extended our permutation tests to incorporate a \u2018pre-outcome\u2019 epoch (-1000ms to 0ms after reward onset), in addition to our existing \u2018outcome\u2019 epoch (0 to 1000ms after reward onset).
