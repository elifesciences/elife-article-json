                    "text": "To protect against aneuploidy, chromosomes must attach to microtubules from opposite poles (\u2018biorientation\u2019) prior to their segregation during mitosis. Biorientation relies on the correction of erroneous attachments by the aurora B kinase, which destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments that lack tension. Incorrect attachments are also avoided because sister kinetochores are intrinsically biased towards capture by microtubules from opposite poles. Here, we show that shugoshin acts as a pericentromeric adaptor that plays dual roles in biorientation in budding yeast. Shugoshin maintains the aurora B kinase at kinetochores that lack tension, thereby engaging the error correction machinery. Shugoshin also recruits the chromosome-organizing complex, condensin, to the pericentromere. Pericentromeric condensin biases sister kinetochores towards capture by microtubules from opposite poles. Our findings uncover the molecular basis of the bias to sister kinetochore capture and expose shugoshin as a pericentromeric hub controlling chromosome biorientation."

Biorientation relies on the correction of erroneous attachments by the aurora B kinase, which destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments that lack tension. Incorrect attachments are also avoided because sister kinetochores are intrinsically biased towards capture by microtubules from opposite poles. Here, we show that shugoshin acts as a pericentromeric adaptor that plays dual roles in biorientation in budding yeast. Shugoshin maintains the aurora B kinase at kinetochores that lack tension, thereby engaging the error correction machinery. Shugoshin also recruits the chromosome-organizing complex, condensin, to the pericentromere. Pericentromeric condensin biases sister kinetochores towards capture by microtubules from opposite poles. Our findings uncover the molecular basis of the bias to sister kinetochore capture and expose shugoshin as a pericentromeric hub controlling chromosome biorientation."

This is possible because on each chromosome a multi-subunit kinetochore assembles on a region of DNA, known as a centromere, to mediate attachment to microtubules. The proper attachment of sister kinetochores to opposite poles, called biorientation, generates tension owing to sister chromatid cohesion (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tanaka, 2010</a>). Sister kinetochores are inherently biased towards capture by microtubules from opposite poles, yet how this is achieved is not known (<a href=\"#bib22\">Indjeian and Murray, 2007</a>). Kinetochore geometry is thought to position microtubule binding sites in a \u2018back-to-back\u2019 orientation during mitosis and this has been hypothesized to contribute to biorientation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hauf and Watanabe, 2004</a>). Where erroneous tension-less attachments do occur, they are destabilized by the aurora B kinase, providing a further opportunity for biorientation to be established (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tanaka, 2010</a>). Shugoshin proteins are localized to the region surrounding the centromere, known as the pericentromere, and have a conserved, yet poorly understood, function in biorientation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Indjeian et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kiburz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Guti\u00e9rrez-Caballero et al., 2012</a>). In fission yeast, frogs, and human cells, shugoshins enable biorientation, at least in part, through recruitment of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) containing aurora B to the pericentromere (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kawashima et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Vanoosthuyse et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kelly et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tsukahara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yamagishi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rivera et al., 2012</a>). Shugoshins also have a more defined role in protecting pericentromeric cohesin from premature loss during meiosis and mammalian mitosis; a function attributed to the recruitment of a specific form of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to the pericentromere (<a href=\"#bib24\">Katis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kitajima et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Marston et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rabitsch et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Riedel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Xu et al., 2009</a>)."

Budding yeast has a single shugoshin, Sgo1, which protects pericentromeric cohesin during meiosis but does not regulate cohesion during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Katis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kitajima et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Marston et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Indjeian et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kiburz et al., 2008</a>). We have exploited this system to investigate the sister kinetochore biorientation function of Sgo1, independently of effects on cohesion. Our analysis leads us to the unanticipated discovery that shugoshin collaborates with the chromosome-organising complex, condensin, in chromosome biorientation. Moreover, we provide the first molecular insight into how sister kinetochores are biased towards capture by microtubules from opposite, rather than the same, pole."

All three mutants and <i>sgo1\u0394</i> cells have previously been reported to affect biorientation after microtubule perturbation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fernius and Hardwick, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Indjeian et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Indjeian and Murray, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Xu et al., 2009</a>). The Sgo1-3A protein retains its pericentromeric localization (<a href=\"#bib60\">Xu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Though the kinetics of cell cycle entry in <i>sgo1-100</i> and <i>sgo1-700</i> mutants is similar to that of wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), Sgo1-100 and Sgo1-700 show only residual initial centromeric recruitment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and are absent from the pericentromeres of cells arrested in mitosis with microtubule-depolymerizing drugs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We compared the ability of these Sgo1 mutants to establish bipolar attachments at metaphase after entering the cell cycle in the absence of microtubules. We used strains with spindle pole bodies (SPBs) labeled with tdTomato (<i>SPC42-</i>tdTomato), the centromere of chromosome IV labeled with GFP (<i>CEN4-</i>GFP) and with <i>CDC20</i> under control of the methionione-repressible promoter (<i>pMET-CDC20</i>), to enable metaphase arrest by addition of methionine. All strains were released from a G1 arrest into nocodazole- and methionine-containing medium to depolymerize microtubules and induce a metaphase arrest before nocodazole was washed out to allow metaphase spindle formation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Under these conditions, initial kinetochore-microtubule attachments are frequently erroneous because they occur before spindle pole bodies have migrated apart, leading to a strong reliance on the error correction process driven by Aurora B. We measured the efficiency of biorientation by scoring the splitting of <i>CEN4-GFP</i> signals once metaphase spindles reform after nocodazole washout. The <i>sgo1-100</i>, <i>sgo1-700</i> and <i>sgo1-3A</i> mutants showed a similar delay and lower maximum level of biorientation that was not as pronounced as in <i>sgo1\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>)."

Therefore, PP2A-Rts1 is not required for sister kinetochore biorientation and the <i>sgo1-3A</i> mutation must disrupt functions of Sgo1 other than its association with PP2A-Rts1."

Budding yeast Sgo1 similarly associates with aurora B (called Ipl1) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Conditional inactivation of Sgo1 using the auxin-inducible degron (aid) system (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nishimura et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) revealed that Sgo1 is not required for the initial recruitment of Ipl1 to centromeres but is important for its maintenance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Indeed, in Sgo1-aid cells arrested in metaphase by treatment with nocodazole, Ipl1 was absent from <i>CEN4</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Early Ipl1 centromere localization also does not require Alk1 and Alk2 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the homologs of Haspin kinase, which is important for centromeric CPC localization in fission yeast and mammals (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kelly et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yamagishi et al., 2010</a>). The recruitment of Ipl1 early in the cell cycle may instead be due to association with the Ndc10/Cbf3 kinetochore protein that is known to recruit the CPC to centromeres (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yoon and Carbon, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cho and Harrison, 2012</a>). Sgo1-independent Ipl1 localization early in the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) can explain why Ipl1, but not Sgo1, is essential for biorientation in an unperturbed cell cycle, though Ipl1 inhibition and deletion of <i>SGO1</i> similarly impair biorientation after microtubule depolymerization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Biggins et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tanaka et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Indjeian et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Indjeian and Murray, 2007</a>). The Ipl1-Sgo1 interaction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and centromeric localization of Ipl1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) were also similarly decreased in nocodazole-treated <i>sgo1-100</i>, <i>sgo1-700</i> and <i>sgo1-3A</i> mutants, which likely contributes to the biorientation defects of these mutants."

(<b>G</b>) The number of reads at coordinates corresponding to the rDNA region on chromosome XII is shown for wild-type and <i>sgo1\u0394</i> anti-HA ChIP samples normalized to the total number of reads for each sample.

For both wild type and <i>sgo1\u0394</i>, the ratio of the local maximum in a 100 bp window for ChIP sample/input is calculated at the indicated distance from the centromere for all 16 chromosomes.

In budding yeast, condensin is most highly enriched in the rDNA and at each pericentromere (<a href=\"#bib10\">D\u2019Ambrosio et al., 2008</a>). Condensin recruitment to the rDNA depends on monopolin (Csm1/Lrs4) (<a href=\"#bib10\">D\u2019Ambrosio et al., 2008</a>). Fission yeast monopolin (Pcs1/Mde4) recruits condensin to centromeres where it prevents merotely (attachment of a single kinetochore to microtubules from both poles) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gregan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tada et al., 2011</a>), unlike budding yeast condensin which is recruited to centromeres independently of monopolin subunit Lrs4 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brito et al., 2010</a>). How condensin is recruited to the pericentromere remains unknown. To test whether the pericentromeric localization of condensin depends on Sgo1 we examined the association of the Brn1 condensin subunit genome wide using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) in wild-type and <i>sgo1\u0394</i> cells arrested in mitosis by treatment with nocodazole. Although the pattern of reads along chromosome arms and mapping to the rDNA was similar in wild-type and <i>sgo1\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>), we observed a clear reduction in pericentromeric levels of Brn1 in <i>sgo1\u0394</i> cells, although peaks of variable height remained at some, but not all core centromeres (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2, 3</a>). Consideration of all 16 centromeres collectively revealed that in wild-type cells, condensin is enriched on average throughout an approximately 15 kb domain on either side of the centromere and that this enrichment is lost in <i>sgo1\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>).

Depletion of the Scc1 subunit of cohesin led to a great reduction in the pericentromeric levels of Sgo1 with only low levels remaining at the centromere itself (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These findings suggest that cohesin promotes Sgo1 association with the pericentromere, which, in turn, recruits condensin, implying an indirect role for cohesin in localizing condensin (through Sgo1) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Consistent with this idea, proper Brn1 association with the centromere in mitosis requires both the Scc2 protein that is required for cohesin loading onto chromosomes and subunits of the kinetochore (Iml3/Chl4) that target Scc2 to centromeres (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ciosk et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fernius et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">D\u2032Ambrosio et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ng et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), However, unlike in fission yeast, the monopolin subunit Lrs4 is not required for Brn1 association with the centromere (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brito et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

Overproduction of Sgo1, which is known to enable its association with chromosome arms and delay cells in metaphase (<a href=\"#bib6\">Clift et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) led to increased levels of condensin at centromere, pericentromere and chromosome arm sites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). <i>SGO1</i> overexpression also increased Brn1 association with the centromere and pericentromere in cells arrested in mitosis by nocodazole treatment (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that increased enrichment of Brn1 in <i>SGO1</i>-overexpressing cells was not purely a consequence of the metaphase arrest. As a more direct test of the ability of Sgo1 to bring condensin to chromosomes, we produced a Sgo1-GFP-TetR fusion protein in cells carrying <i>tetO</i> repeats integrated on a chromosomal arm. In the absence, but not the presence of doxycycline, Sgo1-GFP-TetR is expected to bind to the ectopic site and recruit its binding partners (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Indeed we found that tethered Sgo1-GFP-TetR efficiently recruited the condensin subunit Brn1, the PP2A subunit, Rts1, and to a lesser extent the CPC subunit, Ipl1 to a site directly adjacent to the <i>tetOs</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,F</a>; \u223c50 bp R ectopic site), although centromeric levels were not affected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,G</a>). The recruitment of these proteins to a site \u223c800 bp to the left of the tethering site was much less efficient (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,F</a>), suggesting that recruitment occurs through direct binding to Sgo1, rather than an effect of Sgo1 on the surrounding chromatin. Taken together, these results show that Sgo1 is both necessary and sufficient for condensin recruitment."

                                "text": "Biorientation is achieved both because of a bias for sister kinetochores to be captured by microtubules from opposite poles and owing to error correction which destabilizes mono-oriented kinetochores, allowing a further opportunity for biorientation to occur (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tanaka, 2010</a>). We tested the requirement of condensin for error correction using a conditional degron version of its Ycs5 subunit by monitoring <i>CEN4-GFP</i> separation in metaphase-arrested cells after microtubule depolymerization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In cells where degradation of condensin\u2019s Ycs5 subunit (<i>YCS5-aid</i>) was induced, <i>CEN4-GFP</i> separation was delayed compared to wild-type cells, albeit not to the extent of <i>sgo1\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), suggesting that condensin facilitates biorientation. To further test whether the error correction process operates normally we developed a live cell microfluidics assay to allow biorientation to be observed directly as microtubules were allowed to reform (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1 and 2</a>). Overall, as expected, and consistent with a biorientation defect, the number of frames in which cells with split <i>CEN4-GFP</i> foci were observed was reduced in cells lacking <i>SGO1</i>, where <i>IPL1</i> was inhibited (<i>ipl1-as</i> with NAPP1) or Ycs5 was degraded (Ycs5-aid with NAA) compared to wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). However, the distance between separated <i>CEN4-GFP</i> foci was comparable in all strains, suggesting that kinetochore-microtubule attachments, spindle tension, and cohesion are all functional and only the orientation of attachment is defective in <i>sgo1\u0394</i>, <i>YCS5-aid</i> and <i>ipl1-as</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Furthermore, consistent with a failure to properly biorient chromosomes, unseparated <i>CEN4-GFP</i> tended to be closer to the SPB in <i>sgo1\u0394</i>, <i>YCS5-aid</i> and <i>ipl1-</i>as cells than in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We used the switch between one or two <i>CEN4-GFP</i> foci as a measure of kinetochore reorientation during error correction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). The average frequency of switching between 1 and 2 GFP foci was significantly reduced in <i>sgo1\u0394</i> and <i>ipl1-as</i> cells, as expected (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). We further observed a more modest reduction in switching in <i>YCS5-aid</i> cells, indicating that condensin contributes to proper error correction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). The role of condensin in error correction cannot be to localize Ipl1, as we found that Ipl1 maintenance at kinetochores requires Sgo1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), but not Ycs5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). Rather, we speculate that condensin shapes the pericentromere to place sister kinetochores in a rigid back-to-back orientation that provides the framework for tension-sensing."

The molecular basis of the bias towards sister kinetochore biorientation has therefore remained unknown. If our hypothesis that condensin creates a preferred pericentromeric framework upon which the error correction machinery can act is correct, we reasoned that condensin could also impose a bias on kinetochores to biorient. When SPBs are allowed to separate before microtubules attach to sister kinetochores, they tend to biorient normally, even when error correction is impaired (<a href=\"#bib22\">Indjeian and Murray, 2007</a>). To test the requirement of shugoshin and condensin for sister kinetochore bias, we allowed cells to progress from G1 into the cell cycle for 1.5 hr to allow SPB separation, before treating the cells with nocodazole for 30 min. Subsequently, nocodazole was washed out and we simultaneously began filming (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We recorded the percentage of cells with separated SPBs at the start of filming that separated <i>CEN4-GFP</i> foci at least once during the observation period (approximately 30 min) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3 and 4</a>). Similar numbers of wild-type and <i>ipl1-as</i> cells achieved sister centromere separation, indicating that the error correction process is not required to bias sister kinetochores towards biorientation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). However, remarkably, the frequency of separated <i>CEN4-GFP</i> foci was reduced about two-fold in <i>sgo1\u0394</i> and <i>YCS5-aid</i> cells, as compared to wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). This indicates that in the absence of shugoshin or pericentromeric condensin, the bias to sister kinetochore biorientation is lost. We conclude that both shugoshin and condensin impose a bias on sister kinetochores to biorient and that this is independent of error correction by Aurora B (Ipl1)."

                                "text": "Shugoshins are emerging as factors that define a hub at the pericentromere that integrates the functions of multiple protein complexes to ensure the accuracy of chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib65\">Rattani et al., 2013</a>). To explore the relationship between shugoshin and its binding partners further, we asked whether the Sgo1-100, Sgo1-700 and Sgo1-3A proteins retain their interaction with condensin. We found that Sgo1-700 failed to associate with Brn1, whereas Sgo1-100 and Sgo1-3A retained Brn1 association (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Analysis of Brn1 association with representative centromere-proximal and chromosomal arm sites by ChIP-qPCR revealed that only the <i>sgo1-3A</i> mutant, and not the <i>sgo1-100</i> or <i>sgo1-700</i> mutants maintained Brn1 localization at the pericentromere in cells arrested in mitosis by nocodazole treatment (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). However, in both <i>sgo1-100</i> and <i>sgo1-700</i> mutant cells progressing from G1 into the cell cycle, Brn1-6HA retained a partial ability to associate with the centromere and pericentromere, though only in the case of the <i>sgo1-100</i> did this occur in a timely manner (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As both the Sgo1-100 and Sgo1-700 proteins themselves fail to be maintained at the centromere (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), these observations are difficult to interpret. As a more direct test of the ability of the mutant proteins to recruit condensin, we fused Sgo1-100, Sgo1-700, and Sgo1-3A to tetR and artificially tethered them to <i>tetO</i> arrays located adjacent to <i>CEN4</i> in cells that otherwise lacked <i>SGO1</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013F</a>)<i>.</i> Tethering of Sgo1-tetR-GFP, Sgo1-100-tetR-GFP, or Sgo1-3A-tetR-GFP, all significantly increased Brn1-6HA levels at <i>CEN4</i> compared to a no tag control (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). In contrast, and consistent with our finding that Brn1 fails to co-immunoprecipitate with Sgo1-700 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), tethering of Sgo1-700-tetR-GFP did not significantly enrich Brn1-6HA at the same site, though it was produced to similar levels as the Sgo1-100-tetR-GFP protein (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D,E</a>). Despite the ability of Sgo1-100-tetR-GFP and Sgo1-3A-tetR-GFP fusion proteins to recruit Brn1 to the tethering site at <i>CEN4</i>, only the wild-type Sgo1-tetR-GFP fusion protein was able to partially rescue the segregation of chromosome IV after release from a nocodazole arrest (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This is anticipated as none of the mutant proteins are expected to enable proper Ipl1 association with the centromere (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). We conclude that Sgo1-100 and Sgo1-3A are able to associate with, and recruit, condensin, whereas Sgo1-700 loses this interaction."

Through analysis of both the <i>sgo1-700</i> and <i>sgo1\u0394</i> mutants we have, nevertheless uncovered a role for Sgo1 in biasing sister kinetochores towards biorientation.

                        "text": "Condensin is a cohesin-related complex that can form a ring-like structure and has been proposed to organize chromosomes by bringing distant chromosomal sequences together (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cuylen and Haering, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cuylen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hirano, 2012</a>). The mechanism by which condensin is loaded onto and subsequently maintained on chromosomes is largely unknown. Here, we have identified shugoshin as an important determinant of condensin association with the pericentromere. Indeed, the pericentromeres and rDNA appear to be the predominant, if not the only sites of condensin association with chromosomes in mitosis. Our findings have also suggested a hierarchy of assembly at the pericentromere. In contrast to the idea that the Scc2/4 cohesin-loader complex loads condensin directly (<a href=\"#bib10\">D\u2019Ambrosio et al., 2006</a>), we propose that Scc2/4 indirectly affects condensin localization through loading cohesin, which we show is required for the pericentromeric association of Sgo1. In support of this idea, only cohesin and not condensin subunits were identified in Scc2/4 immunoprecipiates (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fernius et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, since Shugoshin relies on cohesin for its association with the pericentromere (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kiburz et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yamagishi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), the importance of cohesin in defining kinetochore geometry (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sakuno et al., 2009</a>) could be to enable proper condensin association with chromosomes by recruiting shugoshin to the pericentromere. How might condensin shape a favorable pericentromeric geometry? While the molecular function of condensin is not well understood, condensin is known to alter the structural properties of centromeres that affect their dynamic behavior (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ribeiro et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stephens et al., 2011</a>). We propose that condensin organizes the pericentromeric chromatin to provide a structural integrity to the pericentromere that enables it to adopt a \u2018back-to-back\u2019 geometry that orients sister kinetochores in opposite directions, thereby favoring their biorientation (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Although our data indicate that condensin is important to increase the efficiency of biorientation, we do not believe that it is essential for this process in budding yeast, provided that error correction machinery is intact. However, budding yeast centromeres are relatively simple and only a single microtubule contacts each kinetochore (<a href=\"#bib59\">Winey et al., 1995</a>) increasing the probability that correct attachments can be made by chance. This is not the case for organisms with more complex centromeres where it is likely that kinetochore geometry plays a major role in ensuring sister kinetochore biorientation is achieved."

First, early in the cell cycle, shugoshin mediates the enrichment of condensin within the pericentromere. We propose that condensin enables the pericentromere to adopt a geometry that favors the capture of sister kinetochores by microtubules from opposite poles, thereby biasing them to biorient. Second, shugoshin maintains aurora B at the pericentromere for those kinetochores that fail to biorient and come under tension. Aurora B destabillizes these tension-less attachments, thereby providing a further chance to for sister kinetochores to make the appropriate, tension-generating attachments. We suggest that condensin facilitates this \u2018error correction\u2019 process by conferring a rigid structure to the pericentromere upon which aurora B can act."

Shugoshins are therefore emerging as functional hubs that define the pericentromere, allowing it to perform specialized functions that are key for the fidelity of chromosome segregation."

Alpha factor was washed out and cells were released from the G1 arrest into rich medium containing methionine and nocodazole (YPDA + Met + NOC) plus the appropriate drugs (NAPP1, NAA). Methionine represses <i>pMET-CDC20</i> expression, resulting in a metaphase arrest and nocodazole depolymerizes microtubules. After 3 hr, a sample was extracted (t = 0) and nocodazole was washed out by filtering in the presence of methionine and cultures were released into YPDA + Met to allow spindles to reform while maintaining the metaphase arrest. Samples were taken at 20 min intervals. Samples were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, before washing in PBS and resuspending in DAPI for microscopy. Samples with two separated SPC42-tdTomato foci were scored as containing one or two <i>CEN4-GFP</i> foci. Typically 200, and at least 100, cells were scored for each timepoint."

Cells were released in the chamber into medium containing nocodazole (to depolymerize microtubules) and methionine (to deplete <i>CDC20</i> and induce a metaphase arrest) for 30 min. The addition of nocodazole to G1 cells prevents SPB separation because this requires microtubules. Therefore, under these conditions, microtubules do not separate which leads to a high rate of monoorientation once microtubules are allowed to reform. This leads to a strong reliance on the error correction machinery to establish biorientation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Indjeian and Murray, 2007</a>). After 30 min, nocodazole was washed out, all the time maintaining the <i>CDC20</i> arrest by inclusion of methionine in the media.

The authors have found that the Shuoshin protein (Sgo1) is important to promote biorientation through two mechanisms: through binding to the chromosome passenger complex, and through a newly identified association with the condensin complex. The authors show that Sgo1 is able to recruit condensin to centromeres or to ectopic sites. The authors identify a mutation in Sgo1 that perturbs binding to condensin and that this association is important for subsequent biorientation. The authors conclude that condensin is required to form a rigid back-to-back structure such that sister kinetochores are biased towards microtubule capture from opposite spindle poles."

In particular, the conclusion that condensin recruitment alters kinetochore geometry to promote orientation towards opposite poles requires further supporting evidence. Moreover, the authors themselves do not appear to be certain whether there is a direct link between Sgo1 and condensin recruitment. They argue that Sgo1 is sufficient for condensin targeting to the pericentromere by over-expressing Sgo1 and measuring Brn1 accumulation. However, they previously state that Sgo1's effect on condensin is indirect, mediated through Scc2/4 (cohesin). There are also concerns regarding the validity of the approach the authors use to measure bi-orientation and the presentation of the ChIP analyses. The latter prevents a critical evaluation of the data quality and missing information will need to be added."

Similar to the assays in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C and 7B</a>, accurate segregation in this assay would require the activity of the error correction machinery. As expected, due to the impaired ability of all Sgo1 mutant proteins to maintain Ipl1 association with the centromere (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>) only tethered wild type Sgo1 was able to partially rescue the segregation of the chromosome to which it was tethered (chromosome IV; shown in <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). For technical reasons (both <i>SGO1-tetR-GFP</i> and <i>tetR-tdTomato</i> are integrated into the same genomic locus), it was necessary to perform this experiment in diploid cells and therefore we cannot presently test the ability of these tethered constructs to retain sister kinetochore bias (we cannot easily arrest and release the cells from G1 as they are not sensitive to mating pheromone). Moreover, other unpublished findings in the lab have suggested that the dynamicity of Sgo1 on centromeres is key to its regulation and important for accurate segregation so it is likely that Sgo1 tethering affects its function. Indeed, even tethered wild type Sgo1-tetR-GFP is not fully able to rescue the mis-segregation of chromosome IV in our experiment (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Nevertheless, our demonstration of a lack of sister kinetochore bias in the <i>sgo1-700</i> mutant, which cannot bind condensin (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>) or recruit it to centromeres (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>) provides compelling evidence that the Sgo1-condensin interact is critical in biasing sister kinetochores to biorient."

If centromeres were bi-oriented but merely failed to split, they should be positioned at equal distances to both SPBs. If sister centromeres failed to bi-orient, they should frequently be found close to one SPB.

Importantly, the distance between separated sister centromeres in <i>sgo1</i>? and <i>YCS5-aid</i> cells is not significantly different to that of wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This is strong evidence that cohesion is not affected in these cells and that the decreased frequency of sister centromere is due to defective sister-kinetochore biorientation. Furthermore, as suggested by the reviewers, we measured the distance from <i>CEN4-GFP</i> foci to the nearest SPB, in <i>sgo1</i>?, <i>YCS5-aid</i> and <i>ipl1-as</i> cells with a single <i>CEN4-GFP</i> focus after nocodazole washout (shown in <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Taking the median <i>CEN4-SPB</i> distance for wild type as the typical distance, we scored the percentage of cells with shorter or longer distances in each case. In all three mutants, the fraction of cells with a <i>CEN4-SPB</i> shorter than the wild type median was increased, indicating that unpaired sister centromeres tend to reside closer to the SPB, supporting the idea that chromosomes fail to align in the centre of the spindle, as expected when biorientation fails. This effect was less pronounced in the condensin mutant, but this is expected as this has a milder biorientation defect overall (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, Ipl1 is localized in <i>YCS5-aid</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>) and the error correction process is partially functional (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>)."

However, similar experiments with condensin mutants are difficult to interpret as condensin is critical for chromosome arm segregation in anaphase (Renshaw et al., Dev Cell 2010). The situation is further complicated by the fact that due to the partial functionality of the error correction machinery in condensin mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>), condensin is unlikely to be essential for sister kinetochore biorientation, but rather provide a bias that facilitates sister kinetochore capture and efficient error correction. Analysis of the <i>sgo1-700</i> mutant that fails to associate with condensin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) provides strong evidence that Sgo1 promotes the bias to sister kinetochore biorientation through condensin recruitment."

In particular, the ChIP-qPCR signals obtained in experiments where nocodazole was directly added to cycling cells are typically much higher than experiments where cells were first arrested in G1 before being released into nocodazole. The fraction of cells that were approaching, or in, mitosis at the time of nocodazole will spend a much greater time in mitosis, where our proteins of interest are presumably continually recruited, thereby accounting for these differences. Of course, repeats are carried out using exactly the same conditions, with all strains within one repeat grown and processed on the same day, allowing direct comparison for those conditions. Specifically, for the experiment shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> in the old version (now <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), cells were first arrested in G1 before release into nocodazole (this was to allow Sgo1-aid degradation in a single cell cycle), whereas cells for the experiment shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> in the old version (now 3E) were arrested directly in nocodazole. The difference between the levels of Sgo1 and <i>Sgo1-100</i> mutant proteins is likely due to slight changes in the timing of alpha factor release in the handling of these cultures (see above about the interpretation of time course experiments). The main point of these experiments was to show that residual association to centromeres occurs even though it is not maintained in nocodazole-arrested cells. We do not think it is appropriate to take any further interpretation based on the absolute values from these experiments as due to the inherent variability of time course experiments; to do so would require exquisitely controlled conditions and much more closely spaced sampling."
