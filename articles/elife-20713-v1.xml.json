Identifying the circuitry underlying copulation is a necessary step towards understanding universal principles of circuit operation, and how circuit elements are recruited into the production of ordered action sequences. Here, we identify key sex-specific neurons that mediate copulation in <i>Drosophila</i>, and define a sexually dimorphic motor circuit in the male abdominal ganglion that mediates the action sequence of initiating and terminating copulation. This sexually dimorphic circuit composed of three neuronal classes \u2013 motor neurons, interneurons and mechanosensory neurons \u2013 controls the mechanics of copulation. By correlating the connectivity, function and activity of these neurons we have determined the logic for how this circuitry is coordinated to generate this male-specific behavior, and sets the stage for a circuit-level dissection of active sensing and modulation of copulatory behavior."

Identifying the circuitry underlying copulation is a necessary step towards understanding universal principles of circuit operation, and how circuit elements are recruited into the production of ordered action sequences. Here, we identify key sex-specific neurons that mediate copulation in <i>Drosophila</i>, and define a sexually dimorphic motor circuit in the male abdominal ganglion that mediates the action sequence of initiating and terminating copulation. This sexually dimorphic circuit composed of three neuronal classes \u2013 motor neurons, interneurons and mechanosensory neurons \u2013 controls the mechanics of copulation. By correlating the connectivity, function and activity of these neurons we have determined the logic for how this circuitry is coordinated to generate this male-specific behavior, and sets the stage for a circuit-level dissection of active sensing and modulation of copulatory behavior."

One gene called <i>doublesex</i> generates differences in the anatomy and behavior of males and females in many animal species. In male fruit flies, the <i>doublesex</i> gene is active in roughly 650 neurons, with specific groups of cells controlling distinct steps of the courtship ritual. However, it was not understood how the different steps involved in copulation were coordinated to ensure a successful mating."

The circuit, which is in the fruit fly\u2019s equivalent of the spinal cord, is made up of three types of neurons: motor neurons, inhibitory interneurons and mechanosensory neurons. The motor neurons coordinate the joining of the male\u2019s genitals with those of the female. The inhibitory interneurons promote the release of the male\u2019s genitals by opposing the motor neurons, while the mechanosensory neurons possibly coordinate the activity of the other neurons to generate the correct sequence of events needed for copulation. Pavlou et al. also showed that the mechanism that controls how the male attaches to and detaches from the female is independent of ejaculation, indicating that the mechanics of copulation are separate from those of reproduction."

Dissecting the neural substrates that initiate, organize, and terminate these behavioral sequences is critical to understanding behavior. Here, we use <i>Drosophila</i> male courtship behavior as a model to address how a compact circuit coordinates these critical action sequences. <i>Drosophila</i> male courtship behavior is a multi-step goal-directed behavior that has evolved to achieve reproductive success (<a href=\"#bib56\">Villella and Hall, 2008</a>). Typically, the male follows the female, taps her with his forelegs, contacts her genitalia with his mouthparts, sings a species-specific courtship song, and bends his abdomen to copulate (<a href=\"#bib56\">Villella and Hall, 2008</a>). Successful execution of these discrete sequential motor programs requires continuous integration of multiple sensory cues from the female."

Copulation itself also consists of an ordered behavioral progression: first, the male engages external genital structures to grasp the female; then he extrudes the intromittent organ, the aedeagus, and initiates copulation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kamimura, 2010</a>). The male maintains this posture for 15 min or more while transferring a mixture of sperm and seminal fluid to the female (<a href=\"#bib56\">Villella and Hall, 2008</a>). Finally, the male terminates copulation by sequential uncoupling of his genitals and detachment from the female. Failure at any point in this complex action sequence, from courtship to termination of copulation, may prevent reproduction. It follows that the neural substrates of male courtship behavior have evolved to carry out the precise action sequences of copulation."

Manipulating the activity of some, or all, of these neurons profoundly alters male courtship and copulatory behaviors (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stockinger et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Billeter et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rideout et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kohatsu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tran et al., 2014</a>). For example, activating <i>fru</i>- or <i>dsx</i>-expressing neurons in males elicits all courtship and copulatory behaviors (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pan et al., 2011</a>), while inhibiting all\u00a0~650 <i>dsx</i> neurons in males blocks all courtship and copulatory behaviors (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rideout et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, activation of <i>dsx</i> circuitry in males lacking <i>fru</i>-expression (<i>fru<sup>M</sup></i>-null) elicits robust courtship and copulatory behaviors (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pan et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that <i>dsx</i>-specified circuitry encompasses the fundamental neural substrates underlying both courtship and copulation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rideout et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pan et al., 2011</a>).

Indeed, optogenetic activation of <i>dsx</i>-expressing pC2l cluster of neurons in the male brain has been shown to induce attempts to copulate (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kohatsu and Yamamoto, 2015</a>). However, activating <i>dsx</i> neurons in solitary headless males elicits abdominal curling (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pan et al., 2011</a>) and decapitating males <i>in copulo</i> has little effect on the duration of copulation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tayler et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Crickmore and Vosshall, 2013</a>), suggesting the Abg can direct many copulatory behaviors independent of any input from the brain. It is therefore likely that descending signals from the brain serve to initiate copulation by triggering a local circuit module in the Abg that in turn coordinates copulation, but the nature of this Abg circuit has remained unclear."

To investigate the organizational principles of the sex-specific circuits underlying copulation, we used a Split-GAL4 intersectional approach (<a href=\"#bib37\">Luan et al., 2006</a>) to identify <i>dsx</i> neurons within the Abg that express the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in <i>Drosophila</i>. We found that <i>dsx</i> glutamatergic motor neurons innervate muscles of the genitalia and enable genital attachment and intromission; <i>dsx</i> GABAergic inhibitory neurons mediate genital uncoupling likely by inhibition of key motor neurons; and <i>dsx</i> mechanosensory neurons of the genitalia innervate and activate both <i>dsx</i> GABAergic and <i>dsx</i> glutamatergic neurons in the Abg. These results suggest a model in which <i>dsx</i> configures a sexually dimorphic sensorimotor circuit which allows the male to successfully execute the correct action sequence for both genital attachment and detachment."

These project from the VNC via the abdominal nerve trunk (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,d</a>) and arborize onto muscles of the genitalia of both sexes. In males this includes the muscles controlling protraction and retraction of the aedaegus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>) as well as the most distal (A6) longitudinal muscles of the ventral and dorsal abdomen (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>). We further confirmed that <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons encompass all of the motor neurons that innervate all phallic and periphallic musclulature (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1f</a>). In females, these neurons innervate muscles of uterus, spermathecal and parovarian ducts (data not shown). No additional muscular innervations were observed. Neurons in the foreleg (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>) project to the prothoracic ganglion and cross the midline in males, but not females (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,d</a>), which is typical of foreleg gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Possidente and Murphey, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mellert et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rideout et al., 2010</a>).

We therefore tested whether simultaneous contraction of these organs prior to or during copulation, by artificial activation of all <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons, would prevent genital coupling. We expressed the <i>Drosophila</i> heat-activated cation channel dTrpA1 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hamada et al., 2008</a>) in <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons and examined the effects of <i>dsx/vGlut</i> thermoactivation prior to copulation. Pairs of <i>dsx/vGlut&gt;dTrpA1</i> experimental males and wild-type females were heated to 31\u00b0C 10 min prior to and throughout a 1 hr observation period (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2k,l</a>). Thermoactivated <i>dsx/vGlut</i> males displayed less overall courtship towards target females (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2k</a>); as with <i>dsx/vGlut&gt;TNT</i> males, these males displayed all courtship steps, but never successfully copulated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2l</a>). These results indicate that disrupting the activity of <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons pre-copulation, by either complete silencing or activation, perturbs the motor events that are necessary for a male to attach to a female and initiate copulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2h,l</a>)."

Extended thermoactivation of <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons <i>in copulo</i> did not disrupt sperm transfer, as all matings were fertile.

To test this, we expressed dTrpA1 in <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons and examined the effects of <i>dsx/Gad1</i> thermoactivation on courtship and copulatory behaviors. Thermoactivating <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons in these males completely blocked genital attachment in the 1 hr observation period (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3j</a>). The males\u2019 inability to achieve genital coupling was not a result of impaired courtship, as they spent normal amounts of time courting (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3k</a>) and displayed all courtship behaviors, including vigorous, but failed, attempts to copulate. Specifically, <i>dsx/Gad1&gt;dTrpA1</i> males attempted to copulate 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 times within the first 10 min of courtship, while controls attempted to copulate 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 times prior to a successful copulation (n\u00a0=\u00a010). As blocking <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons prolongs copulation and activating them prevents it, we conclude that <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons promote genital uncoupling. Silencing <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons and activating <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons both disrupt genital coupling, suggesting that <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons may selectively inhibit <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons to create the precise pattern of <i>dsx/vGlut</i> activity required for copulation."

Given that the majority of <i>dsx/Gad1&gt;dTrpA1</i> males spent no more\u00a0~6 min <i>in copulo</i>, much less than the\u00a0~8 min requirement for fertile matings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3l</a>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gilchrist and Partridge, 2000</a>), we checked the fertility of each mating.

Lacking drivers that specifically label mechanosensory neurons of the genitalia, we used the lipophilic carbocyanide DiD to retrograde label axons of mechanosensory neurons of the claspers, lateral plates, and hypandrium. Consistent with previous findings, we observed sexually dimorphic axonal projections, which show evidence of somatotopic organization in the Abg (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a\u2013g</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Videos 6</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media8\">8</a>) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Taylor, 1989</a>). Interestingly however, by incubating the dye for 10 days, we also identified for the first time a single afferent axon (per hemisegment) from the claspers that arborizes contralaterally within the Abg and traverses the entire VNC to ultimately terminate in the SEZ of the brain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6h</a>). We then performed these dye fills in flies expressing the dendritic marker \u2018DenMark\u2019 in either <i>dsx/Gad1\u00a0</i>or <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6i,i\u2019</a>). Native expression of DenMark in <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons was too weak to visualize dendritic boutons of <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons and establish a definitive relationship with genital neurons. However, <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons were observed to have prolific dendrites in regions of the Abg occupied by genital sensory terminals (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>). Interestingly, projections of clasper, lateral plate and hypandrium neurons clearly interdigitated with the DenMark signal in <i>dsx/vGlut</i> in the Abg (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6i,i\u2019</a>), suggesting that <i>dsx/vGlut</i> excitatory Abg neurons are poised to receive sensory information from the genitalia."

We stimulated the genital sensory neurons using a minutien pin attached to a micromanipulator. As a negative control, we stimulated segment A5 of the abdomen. Both <i>dsx/vGlut</i> and <i>dsx/Gad1</i> Abg neurons responded strongly to genital, but not abdominal, touch (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c\u2013j</a>, <a href=\"#media9\">Videos 9</a>,<a href=\"#media10\">10</a>). Only a subset of neurons responded; activity maps show that not all areas of the neuropil respond significantly (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d,g</a>; <a href=\"#media9\">Videos 9</a>,<a href=\"#media10\">10</a>), which may be due to regional mechanosensory stimulation. Nonetheless, these results show that sensory neurons of the genitalia functionally connect to <i>dsx/vGlut</i> and <i>dsx/Gad1</i> Abg neurons, and suggest that sensory feedback during copulation alters the activity of an Abg circuit that controls genital coupling and copulation."

These microcircuits exhibit three features, the first of which involves coordinated firing of motor neurons that trigger the contraction of muscles in the appropriate appendages. <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons encompass all motor neurons innervating the genital muscles, including both protractor and retractor muscles associated with the phallic and periphallic organs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kamimura, 2010</a>). Triggering the contraction of these muscles in a sequence-specific manner allows the male to clasp to the female\u2019s oviscape prior to protracting the aedeagus and achieving intromission (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a,b</a>). Prematurely stimulating these contractions likely prevents attachment entirely, much as a human hand cannot grasp an object if it is clenched in a fist. Such a scenario would explain why thermoactivating all <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons blocks copulation, rather than stimulating it, while thermoactivating all <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons <i>in copulo</i> blocks termination of copulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). While the <i>dsx/vGlut</i> population may also include interneurons, this possibility is unlikely to affect the direct artificial activation and blockade of <i>dsx/vGlut</i> motor neurons, which are the final output of the circuit."

This is supported by the finding that activation of <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons <i>in copulo</i> results in immediate termination of copulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). <i>dsx/Gad1</i> interneurons may also prevent males from protracting their copulatory organs indiscriminately.

These neurons feed forward to <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons, <i>dsx/Gad1</i> interneurons, and to neurons in the brain, suggesting that sensory feedback signals not only local motor circuits in the abdominal ganglion but also higher-level control of male sexual behavior by the brain. Perhaps a function of this input <i>in copulo</i> is to aid the establishment of a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition that mediates the appropriate positioning of the male throughout an entire copulation event."

Alternatively, sensory excitation of <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons might outweigh inhibition from <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons, or some <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons might indeed be inhibited by genital touch (via <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons), but inhibition of silent neurons would not give a GCaMP response. Addressing this question awaits the discovery of new driver lines that label distinct subsets of <i>dsx/vGlut</i> and <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons and enable simultaneous imaging, and the development of an image registration methodology that is capable of precise identification of individual neurons in the highly dense Abg between imaging preparations."

Here, we have dissociated genital coupling from all other features; activating <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons <i>in copulo</i> or silencing <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons produces a \u2018stuck\u2019 phenotype, where males successfully transfer sperm and attempt to terminate copulation at the appropriate time, but cannot uncouple from the female. A recent study has shown that sperm transfer is mediated by corazonin-expressing neurons activating serotonergic neurons that innervate the accessory glands (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tayler et al., 2012</a>). Our results show that these neurons are distinct from <i>dsx/Gad1</i> and <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons and that sperm transfer does not require (although it may still be modulated by) <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons or <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons."

Here, blocking the full complement of 150 <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons does not affect copulation persistence but rather prevents genital uncoupling, evidenced by the \u2018stuck\u2019 phenotype. This discrepancy can be explained if the full complement of <i>dsx/Gad1</i> Abg neurons described here are a heterogeneous population of neurons, some that shorten copulation by reducing copulation motivation and others that inhibit glutamatergic neurons that control copulatory muscles (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b</a>). Aberrant motor neuron activity patterns caused by blocking the latter might change sensory or internal feedback to the dopaminergic neurons controlling copulation persistence, explaining why blocking all <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons causes a \u2018stuck\u2019 phenotype rather than increasing copulation persistence. Such \u2018specialist\u2019 inhibitory interneurons are present in many mammalian spinal circuits that drive complex movements (<a href=\"#bib21\">Graziano, 2006</a>).

Meanwhile, descending and ascending signals from these neurons (including sensory feedback from the genitalia) would modulate the activity of the motor circuit in response to the male\u2019s internal state and the environment. Indeed, males mate for longer and increase their sperm load when in the presence of rival males (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bretman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Garbaczewska et al., 2013</a>). This behavioral responsiveness most likely relies on physiological modulation of \u2018decision-making\u2019 neurons, much as increased courtship behavior in socially isolated male flies correlates with increased excitability of \u2018decision-making\u2019 neurons for courtship (<a href=\"#bib25\">Inagaki et al., 2014</a>). In addition, while the <i>dsx/vGlut</i> and <i>dsx/Gad1</i> populations are sexually dimorphic, it is interesting to speculate that similar organizational principles may govern female reproductive behavior, with the analogous female <i>dsx/vGlut</i> and <i>dsx/Gad1</i> neurons controlling behaviors like ovipositor extrusion and retraction. Our findings provide insight into the circuit logic underlying genital coupling, and serve as an entry point to a circuit-level dissection of copulatory behavior and its modification by social experience."

They do a very nice job of identifying the three main sets of sexually dimorphic <i>dsx</i>+ neurons in the male that are responsible for the execution and termination of copulation. This is a relatively understudied aspect of the entire mating process, so the information provided here breaks new and interesting ground. Glutamatergic motor neurons that facilitate genital attachment, GABA inhibitory interneurons that regulate the motor neurons, and genital sensory neurons, all <i>dsx</i>+, were identified and experimentally tested for their putative roles in the circuit. In the end, the work focuses on the neurons in the abdominal ganglia of the ventral nerve cord, where, not surprisingly, much of the action seems to take place. Activation and silencing experiments were conducted for the motor neurons and GABA inhibitory neurons, using powerful splitGal4 genetic tools. Given the absence of such tools for analogous experiments with the sensory neurons, the authors demonstrate GCaMP activation of the motor and GABA neurons in response to genital stimulation, to justify a clear and scholarly model for the circuit logic involved in regulation of copulatory behaviour. The Discussion was a pleasure to read, and nicely put this work into the broader perspective."

It is the first description of a microcircuit proposed to control the male organ during sex, first description of sensory bristles acting to relay sensory information to neurons involved in copulation, first demonstration that the mechanics of copulation can be separated from the control of ejaculation in the fly. It is further noteworthy that the interneurons described here appear to play a different functional role from those described by Crickmore in another outstanding paper. Crickmore's work demonstrated interneurons that control dopaminergic circuitry and regulate the timing of copulation. The Crickmore interneurons could exert an influence by modulating the circuitry described here (by mechanisms unknown). This paper provides a bottom line for any other study that seeks to understand how copulatory behaviour is modulated. Pavlou and colleagues\u2019 discovery and presentation provide a valuable caution against formulaic expectations based on the idea that one or a couple of neurons controls a behaviour. This study retains the complexity of the nervous system while providing a detailed picture of a reflex arc that controls mating behaviour. The ability to separate copulatory behaviour from ejaculation is also of interest because it suggests a mechanism for separating hedonic features of copulation from reproductive function but the authors avoid this sort of speculation. Overall, Pavlou and co-workers deserve credit for an interesting study and a major contribution to the literature."

We would be surprised if GABAA receptors were not involved since the coordination of fast motor behavior would normally involve fast-responding GABA receptors. These RNAi results may be due to incomplete knockdown and/or homeostatic adaptation (Lin et al., 2014).\u201d"

We did see that in a solitary male, thermal activation of <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons resulted in no observable protraction of the aedeagus, possibly due to the simultaneous activation of antagonistic muscle groups. This is supported by our findings that thermal activation of <i>dsx/vGlut</i> neurons prohibits males from achieving genital attachment with a female (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2l</a>). At present, we are developing novel tools to investigate the precise neuromuscular architecture and physiology of the aedeagus."
