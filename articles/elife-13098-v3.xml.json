Many bacterial and most eukaryotic ACs possess membrane anchors with six transmembrane spans. We replaced the anchor of the AC Rv1625c by the quorum-sensing receptor from <i>Vibrio harveyi</i> which has an identical 6TM design and obtained an active, membrane-anchored AC. We show that a canonical class III AC is ligand-regulated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. At 10 \u00b5M, the cholera-autoinducer CAI-1 stimulates activity 4.8-fold. A sequence based clustering of membrane domains of class III ACs and quorum-sensing receptors established six groups of potential structural and functional similarities. The data support the notion that 6TM AC membrane domains may operate as receptors which directly regulate AC activity as opposed and in addition to the indirect regulation by GPCRs in eukaryotic congeners. This adds a completely novel dimension of potential AC regulation in bacteria and vertebrates."

Since then cAMP has been demonstrated to be a universal second messenger translating a variety of extracellular stimuli into a uniform intracellular chemical signal. The enzymes responsible for biosynthesis of cAMP from ATP, adenylate cyclases (ACs), have been biochemically and genetically identified in most bacterial and eukaryotic cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Khandelwal and Hamilton, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Linder and Schultz, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">2008</a>). To date, sequencing has identified six classes of ACs. The small-sized class I (enterobacterial ACs), class II (toxin class) and the minor classes IV-VI are restricted to bacteria (<a href=\"#bib3\">B\u00e2rzu and Danchin, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Linder and Schultz, 2003</a>). The class III ACs are ubiquitous, albeit with differing domain architectures (<a href=\"#bib30\">Linder and Schultz, 2008</a>). The catalytic domains share sequence and structural similarities, yet minor, characteristic sequence peculiarities have resulted in a division into four subclasses, a-d (<a href=\"#bib30\">Linder and Schultz, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tesmer et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tews et al., 2005</a>). A fundamental difference between bacterial and eukaryotic ACs is that the former are monomers which require homodimerization for activity. The mammalian congeners, exclusively class IIIa, present themselves as pseudoheterodimers composed of two concatenated \u2018bacterial\u2019 monomers with slightly diverged, yet complementary domains (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guo et al., 2001</a>). Accordingly, mammalian class III ACs are anchored to the membrane by two putative 6TM bundles, one in each of the concatenated repeats. Our knowledge about regulation of bacterial class III ACs is limited. Apart from a few soluble ACs which appear to be regulated by carbon dioxide or pH near to nothing is known (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kleinboelting et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Steegborn et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tews et al., 2005</a>). The established regulation of the nine mammalian, membrane-delimited AC isoforms is indirect. Stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by extracellular ligands releases Gs\u03b1 intracellularly which binds to ACs and activates. A potentially direct ligand-regulation of class III ACs via their large membrane anchors remains a genuine possibility."

Tsr/Tar and Rv3645 have a signal-transducing HAMP domain in common and both require dimerization. The chimeras were regulated <i>in vitro</i> and\u00a0<i>in vivo</i> by serine or aspartate (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kanchan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mond\u00e9jar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Winkler et al., 2012</a>), i.e. a 2TM receptor, Tsr or Tar, with an extensive periplasmic ligand-binding domain replaced a 6TM AC membrane anchor which lacks periplasmic loops. The data demonstrated that in principle direct regulation of a class III AC via an extracellular ligand is a possibility. The question whether also a 6TM receptor might directly regulate a 6TM AC remained open. This question is addressed here."

For the latter lipophilic ligands have been identified (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ng et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">2010</a>). This has opened the opportunity to replace the 6TM anchor of the mycobacterial class IIIa AC Rv1625c which is considered to be an ancestral form of mammalian ACs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guo et al., 2001</a>), by the prototypically identical 6TM QS-receptor CqsS from <i>V. harveyi</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Here, as a proof of principle, we demonstrate that a 6TM receptor not only substitutes a membrane-anchoring function, but also confers direct regulation of a class IIIa AC via an extracellular ligand with nanomolar potency. Taken together with a bioinformatic analysis the data indicate that the 6TM AC membrane anchors probably have an additional receptor function. This is a first and decisive step to add a novel dimension of direct regulation of class IIIa AC activities."

They comprise &gt;40% of the proteins. A function of these membrane domains beyond fixation in the membrane is unknown. Recently we became aware of the QS-receptors from <i>Vibrio</i> and <i>Legionella</i>, CqsS and LqsS, which feature a membrane anchor of an essentially identical design as the aforementioned ACs, i.e. minimal-length \u03b1-helices and short connecting linkers which presumably severely restrict conformational possibilities (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> for a 2D representation; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tiaden and Hilbi, 2012</a>). For both QS-receptors highly lipophilic ligands have been identified such as CAI-1, the <b><i>C</i></b><i>holerae</i> <b>A</b>uto<b>I</b>nducer<b>-1</b>, (S)-3-hydroxy-tridecan-4-one and LAI-1, the <b><i>L</i></b><i>egionella</i> <b>A</b>uto<b>I</b>nducer<b>-1</b>, (S)-3-hydroxy-pentadecan-4-one (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Spirig et al., 2008</a>). The QS-receptors from <i>Vibrio</i> and <i>Legionella</i> are homodimers linked to histidine-kinases as cytosolic effector domains (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ng and Bassler, 2009</a>). This is comparable to bacterial class III ACs which are homodimers (<a href=\"#bib29\">Linder and Schultz, 2003</a>). These superficial observations suggested that by swapping the membrane anchor/receptor between a 6TM AC and CqsS from <i>Vibrio</i> one might generate a 6TM AC which is regulated by the QS-ligand CAI-1. We chose the mycobacterial class IIIa AC Rv1625c for this investigation because of its similarity to the mammalian congeners (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guo et al., 2001</a>) and the QS-receptor from <i>V. harveyi</i>."

                                "text": "The success of generating a functionally productive chimera between the AC and the QS-receptor hinges on the precondition that a suitable point of transition between both proteins can be found which allows signal propagation from the CqsS receptor to the AC effector. The cytosolic aa sequences exiting from the respective last TMs have no conspicuous complementarity which would indicate a self-evident point of connection (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Therefore, 15 different points of connection between the CqsS receptor and the catalytic domain of Rv1625c were probed. The first points of transition tested were the arginine residues present at the cytosolic membrane exit in both proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The chimera CqsS<sub>1-168</sub>Rv1625c<sub>203-443</sub> was active (16.2 nmol cAMP\u00b7mg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7min<sup>-1</sup>), but unregulated. The basal AC activity of this chimera was comparable to that of the membrane-bound Rv1625c holoenzyme (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guo et al., 2001</a>), i.e. generally the two disparate domains were functionally fully compatible with each other. In the cyanobacterial class IIIa AC CyaG from <i>Arthrospira platensis</i> a distinct N-terminal domain that starts with RSEELL, was required for a functional interaction with the chemotaxis receptor Tsr (<a href=\"#bib55\">Winkler et al., 2012</a>). A comparison between CyaG and Rv1625c AC sequences revealed a similar domain in Rv1625c beginning with RSEALL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Hence, for the Rv1625c AC this point of transition to CqsS was chosen. In the CqsS His-kinase the auto-phosphorylated histidine is part of the canonical H-box (underlined in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Grebe and Stock, 1999</a>). However, several chimeras of CqsS and Rv1625c linked in this region were unaffected by CAI-1. With transition points closer to the membrane exit of the CqsS receptor, e.g. at Val172, Ala181 or Gly185, AC activities were reproducibly stimulated by CAI-1 (not shown). For further experiments we linked Ala181 of the QS-receptor to Arg218 of the Rv1625c AC, generating CqsS<sub>1-181</sub>-Rv1625c<sub>218-443</sub> (abbreviated CqsS-Rv1625c; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) because it responded maximally. The chimera CqsS-Rv1625c was stimulated by 85% with 10 \u00b5M CAI-1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The response was concentration-dependent and the EC<sub>50</sub> concentration for CAI-1 was 400 nM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Discrimination between CAI-1 with a C9 and LAI-1 with a C11 lipid tail was absent. In both cases maximal stimulation at 10 \u00b5M CAI-1 and the EC<sub>50</sub> concentrations were identical (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). These parameters perfectly matched the concentrations of 400 nM required to observe phenotypic responses from the CqsS-His-kinase in <i>V. cholerae</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ng et al., 2011</a>)."

Similarly, bacterial His-kinases of two-component systems are homodimers in which a His-residue of the H-box is phosphorylated either in cis or trans (<a href=\"#bib4\">Casino et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">2009</a>). Here we examined whether dimerization of the QS-receptors is required for AC regulation. The CqsS receptor was connected to known inactive Rv1625c AC point mutants, Rv1625cD300A and Rv1625cR376A. These point mutants complement each other and the dimer is catalytically active (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guo et al., 2001</a>). Thus, CqsS-Rv1625cD300A was inserted into pETDuet-3 alone or in combination with CqsS-Rv1625cR376A. When CqsS-Rv1625cD300A and CqsS-Rv1625cR376A were jointly expressed, robust AC activity and regulation by CAI-1 was observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This demonstrated that the membrane anchors of CqsS dimerize and allow individually inactive AC domains to form an active, ligand-regulated dimer. Expectedly, the expression product of CqsS-Rv1625cD300A was inactive (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The experiment did not answer the question whether ligand binding requires a CqsS dimer. This was addressed by linking the inactive Rv1625c monomers to the 6TM anchors of either Rv1625c or the <i>Legionella</i> LqsS QS-receptor. First, CqsS-Rv1625cD300A and the full-length Rv1625cR376A were jointly expressed in pETDuet-3. AC activity was observed, yet CAI-1 did not regulate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Second, the QS-receptor from LqsS was joined with the inactive Rv1625cR376A in a similar manner. CqsS-Rv1625cD300A and LqsS-Rv1625cR376A were concomitantly expressed. As before, AC activity was restored, yet regulation by CAI-1 was absent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This indicated that the membrane anchors were close enough to enable productive heterodimerization; however, a regulatory ligand-binding site was absent. Possibly one ligand molecule binds at the interface of a receptor homodimer as is the case in the chemotaxis receptors Tsr or Tar or Ni<sup>2+</sup>-binding in PhoQ (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheung et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gardina and Manson, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kanchan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mowbray and Koshland, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yang et al., 1993</a>).

At high cell density, CAI-1 is produced, released and binds to the extracellular CqsS receptor (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wei et al., 2012</a>). In a multistep intracellular process this results in reduced production of virulence factors and allows the pathogen to escape from the host, thus spreading disease (<a href=\"#bib19\">Higgins et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rutherford and Bassler, 2012</a>). Because extracellular loops for ligand binding are absent in CqsS and because of the lipophilicity of the ligand, CAI-1 may bind within the membrane segments of the receptor dimer. Therefore, the question whether CAI-1 stimulation is reversible was examined next. Membranes were stimulated with sub-saturating (300 nM) and saturating (10 \u00b5M) concentrations of CAI-1 for 10\u2009min. The reactions were rapidly stopped by cooling to 0\u00b0C and the pre-stimulated membranes were re-isolated by ultracentrifugation. Those membranes were then stimulated again by CAI-1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Membranes pre-treated with 300 nM CAI-1 had an elevated \u2018basal\u2019 AC activity equivalent to the previous 0.3 \u00b5M CAI-1 stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, left). Accordingly, re-stimulation by 0.3 \u00b5M CAI-1 failed whereas addition of 10 \u00b5M CAI-1 activated to the maximal possible extent. Membranes which were initially exposed to 10 \u00b5M CAI-1 remained almost fully activated and were completely refractory to re-stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In this context we checked whether ligand was specifically binding at the receptor sites or remained unspecifically associated with the membranes. The supernatants of the ultracentrifugation steps of the pre-incubated membranes stimulated na\u00efve membranes according to the previously tested CAI-1 concentrations. This excluded unspecific association of the lipophilic ligand with the membrane or adherence to the reaction vessels. Therefore, we can conclude that CAI-1 stimulation was irreversible. This is slightly reminiscent on the biochemistry of rhodopsin in the mammalian eye. There, retinal is even covalently bound into the membrane-segments of opsin, a GPCR with scant extra-membrane loops. After excitation receptor regeneration requires ligand removal by an enzymatic process and transport to the retinal pigment epithelium which, notably, contains exclusively adenylate cyclase type VII (<a href=\"#bib53\">V\u00f6lkel et al., 1996</a>). How in <i>Vibrio</i> signal termination is accomplished remains to be investigated. Possibilities are an inactivating metabolism of CAI-1 or proteolysis."

The functional membrane anchor replacement accompanied by a gain of a novel physiological function suggests that the Rv1625c 6TM anchor actually constitutes an orphan receptor, i.e. receptor without known ligand. Therefore, we examined the relationship between the QS-receptors and the 6TM AC membrane anchors by a focused bioinformatic approach."

                                "text": "From the Uniprot Reference Proteomes databank we obtained all class III ACs using the highly conserved catalytic domain for data mining (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The catalytic domains were stripped; the putative 6TM domains were extracted and retained. Similarly, we extracted 6TM modules related to the CqsS quorum-sensing receptor. The combined data set comprising a total of 1616 6TM modules was subjected to a cluster analysis using the CLANS software (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Frickey and Lupas, 2004</a>). In total, six distinct clusters were observed, five of which were interconnected to different extents, among them the cluster of QS-receptors (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). This clear-cut separation of 6TM modules is surprising and revealing. Transmembrane spanning \u03b1-helices have a strong predilection for hydrophobic residues with Leu, Ile, Val, Ala, Gly and Phe comprising two-thirds (<a href=\"#bib45\">Senes et al., 2000</a>). Yet, the unequivocal clustering indicates a differentiated pattern of conserved 6TM variants which is at odds with an assignment of simply an anchoring device. We propose that the diversity of conserved patterned subtypes mirrors a succinct adaptation to particular physiological functions. By far the majority of 6TM modules were eukaryotic ACs, from the slime mold <i>Dictyostelium</i>, the extant coelacanth up to man. The preponderance of eukaryotic sequences is, at least in part, due to the fact that in vertebrates nine distinct membrane-delimited pseudoheterodimeric AC isoforms exist, each with two TM modules, TM1 and TM2. The observed clusters were identified as follows: (<i>1</i>)\u00a0An isolated, unconnected cluster of 30 bacterial class IIIb ACs is characterized by a ferredoxin between the membrane and the catalytic domain. A representative example is an AC from <i>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</i> (Uniprot Q132R4) which intracellularly appends to a ferredoxin module. The membrane anchors show sequence similarity to the cytochrome b subunits present in the fumarate reductase/succinate dehydrogenase protein families to an extent that they can be matched by simple BLAST searches. These 6TM modules have four precisely spaced intra-membrane histidine residues which coordinate heme as an electron carrier (<a href=\"#bib10\">Einsle et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hederstedt, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kern et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">2010b</a>). It can confidently be predicted that the AC 6TM anchors of this cluster will turn out to contain two heme entities as prosthetic groups. (<i>2</i>)\u00a0A cluster of 118 bacterial class IIIb ACs is characterized by a signal-transducing HAMP domain between membrane anchor and catalytic domain such as the well-studied mycobacterial AC Rv3645 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hazelbauer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hulko et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kanchan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mond\u00e9jar et al., 2012</a>). (<i>3</i>)\u00a0A cluster of 42 bacterial class IIIb ACs shows partly high local similarity to ACs of cluster (<i>2</i>) as visualized by the number and intensity of the gray colored connecting lines between both clusters (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Yet, ACs in cluster (<i>3</i>) lack a HAMP domain. To our knowledge, none of these ACs has ever been interrogated experimentally. (<i>4</i>) A cluster of 35 membrane anchors from bacterial class IIIa ACs as prototypically represented by the mycobacterial AC Rv1625c used here. It is predominantly connected to the cluster with mammalian TM modules. (<i>5</i>)\u00a0Two tightly connected groups are combined here into one cluster of 677 TM1 and 653 TM2 modules which are derived from eukaryotic, mostly vertebrate, pseudoheterodimeric class IIIa ACs. The difference in the number of TM1 and TM2 units is due to individual sequence divergences of the TM2 domains, database miss-annotations, and problems in the automated prediction of transmembrane spans. (<i>6</i>) A cluster of 56 6TM modules corresponds to quorum-sensing receptors of the CqsS type."

The latter protein was selected because a high-resolution structure is available, i.e. they form a 2x6TM homodimer of short TM spans and loops analogous to those from Rv1625c and CqsS (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lu et al., 2014</a>). The lengths of the six TM segments and of the five loops were well conserved between orthologues of the same anchor type and highly similar between anchors of the bacterial AC classes IIIa and IIIb, eukaryotic TM1, and, most surprisingly, CqsS-like QS-receptors (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). On the other hand, the eukaryotic TM2 anchors, those of the ferredoxin-associated class IIIb, and anchors coupled to a cytosolic HAMP-domain (class IIIb ACs in cluster 2) had one or even several elongated loops or \u03b1-helices (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Therefore, the structures of transmembrane domains of eukaryotic AC TM1, the bacterial class IIIa ACs such as Rv1625c, and QS-receptors of the CqsS type can be reasoned to possess overall structural similarities with that of cytochrome b561."

Since then, our knowledge concerning the membrane anchors has not advanced; to date no function for approximately 40% of a class IIIa AC protein sequence has been identified which goes beyond a mere membrane fixation. After 26 years we demonstrate for the first time that a canonical class IIIa AC with a 6TM membrane anchor is directly regulated by a membrane receptor of an identical design, yet with a known ligand, the QS-receptor from <i>V. harveyi.</i>"

In absence of bacterial G-proteins bacterial class III ACs probably will turn out to be directly regulated via their prominent membrane anchors with the above mentioned <i>R. palustris</i> AC as an emerging example. In fact the membrane anchors of the class IIIa bacterial ACs are highly diverged whereas the catalytic domains are conserved (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This suggests that in bacteria the TM domains have evolved independently and very rapidly relative to the catalytic domains. This is in agreement with the general observation that mutations in upstream regulatory domains mostly are neutral and over time a variety of ligand specificities have evolved by chance mutations. At the same time even slightly detrimental mutations in downstream effector domains are not tolerated, thus resulting in sequence and functional conservation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schultz and Natarajan, 2013</a>). In such an evolutionary scenario the mechanisms of signal transduction per se remain intact and allow revealing combinatorial diversity as demonstrated here (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schultz et al., 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "In contrast, in vertebrates the membrane-delimited ACs are regulated indirectly by GPCR activation which intracellularly results in release of G\u03b1 proteins. Is this the result of a loss of direct ligand regulation during evolution while indirect GPCR regulation evolved or has ligand regulation of mammalian ACs been missed so far? Because the AC membrane bundles of vertebrates are highly conserved in an isoform-specific manner from the coelacanth to man (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a> as an example of mammalian AC_I and AC_II subtypes) one can reasonably assume that they have an indispensable physiological function. This could be a particular compartmentalized membrane localization e.g. described in (<a href=\"#bib8\">Crossthwaite et al., 2005</a>) or, in our view more likely and in accordance with our findings an as yet hidden receptor function, as a direct ligand-binding module or in conjunction with an accessory membrane protein that operates as the true sensor. The second alternative would suggest that in vertebrates regulation of intracellular cAMP concentrations is subject to an interaction between direct, ligand-mediated and indirect GPCR-Gs\u03b1-regulated effects. A lasting receptor occupation by a ligand during different physiological states might well set the responsiveness of mammalian AC isoforms to a transient GPCR-Gs\u03b1 activation. This would allow that lasting and transient physiological conditions converge via direct and indirect regulation in a central second messenger system, a situation absent in bacteria. This concept poses the questions whether in vertebrates suitable extracellular signals exist and whether the molecular provisions for a direct signal transduction through the 9 AC isoforms have been evolutionarily conserved. We are currently exploring these questions."

                        "text": "Recently we demonstrated that we could functionally replace the bacterial AC 6TM anchors by the <i>E. coli</i> chemotaxis receptors for serine or aspartate (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kanchan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Schultz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Winkler et al., 2012</a>). By analogy, the results supported the hypothesis of a receptor function for the AC membrane anchors. A less plausible interpretation would have been that the functional coupling might just be a manifestation of the modular composition of signaling proteins. The compatibility may only have required that a satisfactory domain order is maintained in such chimeras without invoking a functional relatedness. The data reported here add an entirely novel dimension to the working hypothesis that AC membrane anchors in bacterial homodimeric as well as in mammalian pseudoheterodimeric ACs function as ligand receptors. The 2D models of the membrane anchors of Rv1625c and CqsS are similar (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This should allow an almost isosteric replacement. Competent QS-receptor and cyclase chimeras were dependent on the point of linkage indicating that the connecting sites had been evolutionarily predesigned, were conserved and fully operational for signal transduction between functionally differing proteins (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schultz and Natarajan, 2013</a>). Implicitly this supports the prediction that the 6TM anchors of such ACs have a receptor function for which stimuli have yet to be identified. Because the ligands for CqsS and LqsS are known, the direct regulation of AC activity then is no real surprise. Admittedly, based alone on the biochemical data one might again take pains to argue that the exchangeability of 6TM-anchors just extends the range of signaling modules which can structurally and possibly functionally replace each other. This alternative interpretation is rather implausible in our view. First mixing and matching TM domains of eukaryotic AC is impossible without loss of activity (<a href=\"#bib44\">Seebacher et al., 2001</a>). Second, the cluster analysis visualizes similarities between individual pairs of CqsS receptor type modules and membrane anchors from class IIIa ACs. Thus it supports the hypothesis that the membrane anchors of class III ACs, bacterial and mammalian alike have a function beyond membrane fixation. In this context cluster (<i>1</i>),\u00a0which is unrelated to all other clusters, is particularly interesting. It demonstrates that comparable transmembrane architectures can result in significantly different sequence patterns notwithstanding the similar amino acid composition commonly shared by all membrane domains. Currently, it is impossible to speculate about or even predict the nature of ligands for the 6TM AC modules examined here. One might expect, however, that they will be closely associated with the intra-membrane space as extra-membranous loops for ligand-binding are noticeably absent in this type of 6TM bundles."
