However, there are no data showing how exactly the regulation emerges from specific lipid-protein interactions. Here we show in atomistic detail how the human \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR) \u2013 a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor \u2013 is modulated by cholesterol in an allosteric fashion. Extensive atomistic simulations show that cholesterol regulates \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR by limiting its conformational variability. The mechanism of action is based on the binding of cholesterol at specific high-affinity sites located near the transmembrane helices 5\u20137 of the receptor. The alternative mechanism, where the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR conformation would be modulated by membrane-mediated interactions, plays only a minor role. Cholesterol analogues also bind to cholesterol binding sites and impede the structural flexibility of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR, however cholesterol generates the strongest effect. The results highlight the capacity of lipids to regulate the conformation of membrane receptors through specific interactions."

However, there are no data showing how exactly the regulation emerges from specific lipid-protein interactions. Here we show in atomistic detail how the human \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR) \u2013 a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor \u2013 is modulated by cholesterol in an allosteric fashion. Extensive atomistic simulations show that cholesterol regulates \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR by limiting its conformational variability. The mechanism of action is based on the binding of cholesterol at specific high-affinity sites located near the transmembrane helices 5\u20137 of the receptor. The alternative mechanism, where the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR conformation would be modulated by membrane-mediated interactions, plays only a minor role. Cholesterol analogues also bind to cholesterol binding sites and impede the structural flexibility of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR, however cholesterol generates the strongest effect. The results highlight the capacity of lipids to regulate the conformation of membrane receptors through specific interactions."

Subsequent biophysical and biochemical studies have provided direct evidences of multiple distinct conformational states for specific GPCRs, such as \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR (<a href=\"#bib44\">Manglik and Kobilka, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kobilka, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nygaard et al., 2013</a>).

GPCRs belonging to this class show a high structural similarity and functional diversity. The literature reporting on the specific functional role of cholesterol and other lipids is extensive (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pucadyil and Chattopadhyay, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gimpl, 2016</a>). It has been experimentally shown that cholesterol affects the conformation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Muth et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Casiraghi et al., 2016</a>) and function (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gimpl et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Paila et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pucadyil and Chattopadhyay, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Casiraghi et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jafurulla et al., 2014</a>) of many GPCRs.

Spectroscopic (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gater et al., 2014</a>) and MD simulation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Prasanna et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lee et al., 2012</a>) studies have reported direct interactions between cholesterol and GPCRs, including \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR. Experimental data show that cholesterol binding to \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR changes its structural properties (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hanson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zocher et al., 2012</a>). Cholesterol is also necessary in crystallizing \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cherezov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hanson et al., 2008</a>), and cholesterol and its analogue cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) have been exhibited to improve \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR stability (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zocher et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Loll, 2014</a>). Since the\u00a0structure and function of GPCRs are closely related, cholesterol binding specifically to \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR is also expected to change the functional properties of the receptor. Indeed experimental studies indicate that cholesterol has a functional role in \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR (<a href=\"#bib55\">Paila et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pontier et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Xiang et al., 2002</a>). Further, inhibition of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR-associated signaling has been observed with increasing membrane cholesterol content (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pontier et al., 2008</a>). However, as with GPCRs in general, the atomic-scale mechanism cholesterol uses to regulate \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR is not known. Does cholesterol modulate \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR activity through membrane-mediated effects by altering the physical properties of the membrane? Alternatively if regulation takes place through specific direct interactions, then what is the atom-scale mechanism?"

One of them has a relatively open G protein site (L<sub>G</sub> being 10\u201312 \u00c5) and a smaller ligand-binding site (L<sub>L</sub> ~ 13 \u00b1 1 \u00c5). The other conformation is characterized by a shift of\u00a0~3\u20134 \u00c5 from the intracellular end of H6 towards the receptor core that blocks the G protein interface (L<sub>G</sub>\u00a0~\u00a08.5 \u00c5).

To further quantify this, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a> depicts the standard deviation for the fluctuations of the intracellular and extracellular ends of H5 and H6, when these ends are bound or unbound to cholesterol.

We observe inward swinging of H6 towards H3 in the absence of cholesterol (which occurred in two out of three replica simulations).

We focus on four different analogues (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>): (i-ii) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) and its deprotonated form (CHSA), and (iii-iv) two oxysterols, 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol (4\u03b2-OH-Chol) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH-Chol), oxidized at the cholesterol ring and tail, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6A</a>). As compared to cholesterol, CHS is a more water-soluble cholesterol ester and is widely used in structural biology and biophysical studies as a cholesterol analogue (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zocher et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Loll, 2014</a>). Oxysterols, on the other hand, are derivatives of cholesterol with additional oxygen-containing substitutions at different positions of cholesterol (<a href=\"#bib52\">Olkkonen and Hynynen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kulig et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Neuvonen et al., 2014</a>). Due to the structural similarities with cholesterol, these analogues mimic cholesterol as to the effects on membrane properties (e.g., increasing bilayer order and thickness), although to different extents (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kulig et al., 2015a</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2015b</a>)."

Meanwhile, CHS closely mimics the behavior of cholesterol (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). Among the three major cholesterol interaction sites observed in our simulations, we find a very high CHS density at IC2 (<a href=\"#fig2s8\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 8C\u2013F</a>). High occupancy of CHS is also observed near IC1 (at 40 mol% CHS concentration) but not at all at EC1. Occupancy of CHS at IC1 is consistent with the crystal structure of \u03b2<sub>1</sub>AR (<a href=\"#bib64\">Warne et al., 2011</a>)."

As a result, the average density maps, showing the lateral arrangement of these sterols around \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR, are similar to those of 10 and 40 mol% cholesterol systems (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and reproducible. Unlike 4\u03b2-OH-Chol, 27-OH-Chol prefers to interact with the receptor directly (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>).

All the cholesterol analogues studied here have a rigid ring structure, yet their slightly different chemical compositions influence their occupancy as well as the strength of binding to the cholesterol-binding sites (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). This is assessed here in terms of the van der Waals energy, which as a short-range interaction reflects how strongly two molecules are in contact and therefore serves as an appropriate measure for the gravity of lipid-protein binding in the binding site."

At IC2 the strength of interaction of CHS and cholesterol is comparable. Meanwhile, the extracellular EC1 site remains unoccupied by CHS indicating the binding energy to be low. As to the two oxysterols, 4\u03b2-OH-Chol interacts with \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR only at EC1 and the interaction is weak, while 27-OH-Chol binds at EC1 as tightly as cholesterol, but its interaction at the two other binding sites (IC1 and IC2) is much weaker than in the case of cholesterol.

This additional chain does not interfere binding at IC2, but it does alter the binding at IC1 and EC1. In 27-OH-Chol, the oxidation has taken place in the short acyl chain that is the terminal subunit of the molecule. This does not interfere the binding at EC1 but does alter the binding at IC1 and IC2. Finally, in 4\u03b2-OH-Chol, the oxidation has occurred in the rigid steroid moiety, making the \u03b1-side of the molecule rougher. In cholesterol, the \u03b1-side is exceptionally flat. Given this change in surface roughness, and the importance of the surface-surface contact in lipid-\u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR binding in the binding site, it is quite obvious why this oxysterol does not bind to any of the cholesterol binding sites (IC1, IC2, EC1)."

We identified three high-affinity cholesterol interaction sites in \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>): IC1 (at the cleft of H1-H4 on the intracellular side), IC2 (H5-H6 on the intracellular side), and EC1 (the H5-H6-ECL3-H7 region on the extracellular side). IC1 and EC1 are in agreement with the locations of cholesterol found in GPCR crystal structures (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cherezov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hanson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). IC1 contains a cholesterol consensus motif that predicts cholesterol binding for 44% of human class A receptors (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hanson et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, these binding sites appear to be evolutionarily conserved in \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR, which suggests their possible allosteric role in receptor function. A recent simulation study reported a correlation between cholesterol occupancy at IC1 and \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR dimerization (<a href=\"#bib58\">Prasanna et al., 2014</a>). However, not much is known about the functional relevance of cholesterol binding to the other sites of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR."

In a cholesterol-free membrane the receptor samples multiple conformational states (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) accounting for the high basal activity of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR (<a href=\"#bib44\">Manglik and Kobilka, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kobilka, 2013</a>). Our results show that the presence of cholesterol in high densities around H5-H6-H7 impedes the dynamic nature of the receptor. In cholesterol-containing (\u226510 mol% cholesterol) membranes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>), the overall structural flexibility of the receptor is significantly reduced to one predominant conformation. We observed that in the presence of strongly bound cholesterol, H5 and H6 undergo much smaller displacements from their average positions as compared to the situation without cholesterol (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Cholesterol analogues that occupy the same interaction sites also restrict the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR conformation (<a href=\"#fig2s9\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 9</a>), although their effects are weaker compared to those of cholesterol. Cholesterol or cholesterol-like molecules bound at these inter-helical clefts can thus confine the movement of the respective helices to a substantial degree, thus dampening the overall conformational dynamics of the receptor. At IC2 of inactive \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR, cholesterol pushes the intracellular end of H6 more towards the core of the helical bundle and prevents the outward movement of H6 required for G protein binding. The restriction of H6 movement by cholesterol is a potentially important allosteric effect, which can be used to modulate the receptor activity."

This result supports the postulate that cholesterol restricts the conformational dynamics of the receptor by binding at specific interaction sites and governs changes between different receptor states, therefore modulating its function. Moreover, cholesterol binding at IC2 in both inactive and active states of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR as found in our simulations highlights the biological relevance of this interaction site in allosteric regulation of the receptor conformation."

Besides techniques like protein engineering and use of detergents to increase the intrinsic stability of the receptor (<a href=\"#bib42\">Loll, 2014</a>), cholesterol/CHS has emerged as a necessary component for crystallization of many GPCRs, including \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cherezov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hanson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zocher et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Loll, 2014</a>). Our work shows that in the presence of more than\u00a0~10 mol% cholesterol, inactive \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR partly loses conformational variability and populates just one major conformation. Achieving conformational homogeneity is the key to crystallize membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib42\">Loll, 2014</a>). In agreement with our results, a recent experimental study showed that CHS impacts the conformational dynamics of a GPCR leading to a restricted conformational space (<a href=\"#bib6\">Casiraghi et al., 2016</a>). Earlier it was experimentally reported that cholesterol induces a more compact conformational state of the oxytocin receptor (<a href=\"#bib47\">Muth et al., 2011</a>).

In addition, the function of adrenergic receptors is known to be modulated by cholesterol: cholesterol depletion enhances \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR-associated signaling, while increased cholesterol content inhibits signaling (<a href=\"#bib55\">Paila et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pontier et al., 2008</a>)."

To define the three major interaction sites on the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR surface, we used the amino acid residues (with contact fraction\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.4) as shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. The time series was then additionally smoothed (over one ns time windows) to discard very rapid \u2018leave and return\u2019 motions of cholesterol that take place due to thermal fluctuations. Given that lateral diffusion of lipids at the protein surface is very slow, and the lipids essentially do not move at all during a 1-ns time window, these fluctuations were then taken care of by the smoothing procedure. We then calculated the normalized time correlation function (to describe the time-dependent probability of cholesterol that is next to the receptor to stay in contact with the receptor) over all individual cholesterol binding/unbinding events occurred in all independent simulation trajectories for all cholesterol molecules present in a system at a given cholesterol concentration (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arnarez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Horn et al., 2014</a>)."

Cholesterol constitutes a particularly interesting example, as it has a complex effect on membrane structure and is also known to bind specifically to many membrane proteins. One such case is the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22-AR), to which cholesterol molecules have been shown to bind specifically. Moreover, cholesterol has been found to improve the stability, ligand binding, and signaling properties of the \u03b22-AR. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects have never been explained in detail, and it is unclear whether cholesterol acts directly or by changing membrane properties like thickness or order. Aside of the academic interest in understanding how cholesterol modulates GPCR action, this issue is also important for the pharmaceutical industry. GPCRs constitute a major target for pharmaceutical drugs and there is a growing interest in finding molecules that can modulate GPCR activity by binding to allosteric sites."

The simulations predicted three main cholesterol binding sites. The first (IC1) is in agreement with the crystal structures of the \u03b22-AR, and is at the general area of a known conserved cholesterol-binding motif (CCM). The second binding site (IC2) is undocumented, and the third (EC1) is in agreement with the crystal structure of the adenosine 2A receptor. While the validity of EC1 and IC2 as specific cholesterol binding sites is yet to be confirmed, the fact that the well-documented IC1 has also been predicted by the same simulations is encouraging. Furthermore, EC1 and IC2, if valid, can be used as potential target sites for GPCR-specific drugs."

This effect was not observed when the general properties of the membrane were changed in the absence of cholesterol, and thus, the authors concluded that this effect is specific. The second cholesterol-induced effect predicted by the simulation appeared in the second binding site, IC2. There, cholesterol was predicted to push the intracellular end of TM6 more towards the core of the helical bundle, and prevented the outward movement of this helix. This effect is particularly interesting, as the outward movement of TM6 is associated with GPCR activation, and creates the binding site for the receptor's cognate G-protein. The restriction of TM6 movement by cholesterol is a potentially important allosteric effect, which again, can be used to modulate GPCR activity."

To explore this in more detail, we calculated the total van der Waals (vdW) interaction energy as well as the number of contacts between cholesterol and \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR, when cholesterol is in the IC1, IC2, or EC1 binding site (please see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

In the article describing the crystal structure, the authors used the occluded surface area method to analyze internal packing of helices (Gilchrist, 2010). The study showed that cholesterol increases the packing of H4, indicating decreasing mobility (Gilchrist, 2010). The effect was suggested to be due to the binding of cholesterol at IC1, where H4 establishes major binding interactions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a>). From the simulation trajectory we calculated the standard deviation of H4 fluctuations, when IC1 is either occupied or unoccupied by cholesterol (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 2</a>). Our results show that the fluctuations of H4 around its average position are more suppressed when cholesterol is bound to IC1. This result is in agreement with experimental findings. While H4 is not one of the strongest points of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR fold, its decreased mobility may account for the enhanced stability of the receptor. We did not observe similar stabilizing effects of cholesterol binding at IC1 on the helices H1-H3. Finally, a recent simulation study reported a correlation between cholesterol occupancy at IC1 and \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR dimerization (Lefkowitz, 2000). This study showed that cholesterol occupancy at H4 restricts its participation in dimer interface formation and subsequently stabilizes the dimer interface with H1 and H2 instead of H4 and H5 (Lefkowitz, 2000)."

To decouple the effect of IC1 from the two other binding sites, we consider the following cases. Our results show that CHS interacts at IC2 as strongly as cholesterol (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). In systems with 10 mol% CHS, we observed a high CHS density at IC2, but not at IC1 or EC1 (<a href=\"#fig2s8\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 8C, D</a>). In the system with 40 mol% CHS, in addition to a high CHS density at IC2, IC1 is also occasionally occupied by CHS, while EC1 remains unoccupied (<a href=\"#fig2s8\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 8E, F</a>). In either of these cases, CHS restricts the dynamics of the G protein-binding site similarly to the extent of cholesterol (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C, E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s9\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 9C, D</a>), irrespective of whether IC1 is occupied or unoccupied by cholesterol. The result indicates that sterol occupancy at IC2, but not at IC1, is crucial for controlling the dynamics of the G protein binding site, calculated by the displacement of the intracellular part of H6. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that in the presence of 5 mol% cholesterol, \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR exhibits large fluctuations at the G protein binding site (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 3</a>), where IC1 is occupied by cholesterol but IC2 remains unoccupied (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>(top panel)). In bilayers with CHS, no CHS was observed at the extracellular binding site EC1. Consequently, in these systems \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR shows large fluctuations at the extracellular ligand binding site, irrespective of the high CHS occupancy at IC2 and also at IC1 for systems with 40 mol% CHS."

At cholesterol concentrations above about 10 mol%, one finds sharper distributions with a single peak, reflecting the confinement of the receptor in a particular conformational state. Moreover, <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 3</a> shows that in individual simulations for a given cholesterol concentration, the receptor samples essentially similar states, indicating quite complete convergence of the present simulation results.

The literature reporting on the specific functional role of cholesterol and other lipids is extensive (Ozcan et al., 2013; Dror et al., 2011). Reportedly cholesterol has been shown to affect the conformation (Oates and Watta, 2011; Lingwood and Simons, 2010) and function (Ozcan et al., 2013; Oates and Watta, 2011;Allen, Halverson-Tamboli and Resenick, 2007; Contreras et al., 2012; Coskun et al., 2011) of many GPCRs. Experimental data have been published that cholesterol binds specifically to \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR (Gilchrist, 2010; Neale et al., 2015), and it has been experimentally shown that cholesterol binding to \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR changes its structural properties (Gilchrist, 2010; Dawaliby et al., 2016). Since structure and function of GPCRs are closely related one may thus expect that cholesterol binding specifically to \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR changes also the functional properties of the receptor. Indeed a few experimental papers have been published which indicate that cholesterol also has a functional role (Paila and Chattopadhyay, 2009; Gimpl, Burger and Fahrenholz, 1997). Thus, in our study we wanted to understand a molecular dynamics basis where and how cholesterol binds to \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR and which are the possible structural and functional effects."
