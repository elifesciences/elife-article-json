The pathomechanisms, however, are poorly understood. This study assessed the unexpected role of the Hedgehog pathway in adult liver lipid metabolism. Using transgenic mice with conditional hepatocyte-specific deletion of Smoothened in adult mice, we showed that hepatocellular inhibition of Hedgehog signaling leads to steatosis by altering the abundance of the transcription factors GLI1 and GLI3. This steatotic 'Gli-code' caused the modulation of a complex network of lipogenic transcription factors and enzymes, including SREBP1 and PNPLA3, as demonstrated by microarray analysis and siRNA experiments and could be confirmed in other steatotic mouse models as well as in steatotic human livers. Conversely, activation of the Hedgehog pathway reversed the \"Gli-code\" and mitigated hepatic steatosis. Collectively, our results reveal that dysfunctions in the Hedgehog pathway play an important role in hepatic steatosis and beyond."

The pathomechanisms, however, are poorly understood. This study assessed the unexpected role of the Hedgehog pathway in adult liver lipid metabolism. Using transgenic mice with conditional hepatocyte-specific deletion of Smoothened in adult mice, we showed that hepatocellular inhibition of Hedgehog signaling leads to steatosis by altering the abundance of the transcription factors GLI1 and GLI3. This steatotic 'Gli-code' caused the modulation of a complex network of lipogenic transcription factors and enzymes, including SREBP1 and PNPLA3, as demonstrated by microarray analysis and siRNA experiments and could be confirmed in other steatotic mouse models as well as in steatotic human livers. Conversely, activation of the Hedgehog pathway reversed the \"Gli-code\" and mitigated hepatic steatosis. Collectively, our results reveal that dysfunctions in the Hedgehog pathway play an important role in hepatic steatosis and beyond."

This deletion disrupted Hedgehog signaling and led to lipids accumulating in the liver and eventually to steatosis. These changes were associated with an increase in the amounts and activityof several enzymes (and the proteins that regulate these enzymes) that help to synthesize lipids. Steatosis was also associated with low amounts of two of the three GLI factors; indeed, this seems to be key for triggering problems with lipid metabolism. Human livers with steatosis showed the same changes in levels of the GLI factors."

                        "text": "As the most common liver disease in the western countries and a disease with an increasing prevalence, non-alcoholic fatty\u00a0liver disease (NAFLD) is the subject of many investigations and studies (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmed et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dongiovanni et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhang and Lu, 2015</a>) to identify unknown risk factors and new treatment strategies. Hepatic steatosis is the hallmark feature of NAFLD (<a href=\"#bib17\">Enomoto et al., 2015</a>) and has the potential to develop into more severe steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis and cancer. Steatosis occurs when the rate of fatty acid delivery exceeds the rate of fatty acid removal (oxidation and export). A comprehensive knowledge of the hepatic lipid metabolism and its control mechanisms is crucial for preventing and treating liver steatosis. To date, these control mechanisms, e.g. the factors governing hepatocyte heterogeneity in lipid metabolism, remain largely unknown and have not yet received adequate attention in the discussion of NAFLD (<a href=\"#bib48\">Postic and Girard, 2008</a>). Metabolic zonation of the liver is of considerable importance for the optimal integration and regulation of the plethora of different hepatic functions and metabolic homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gebhardt, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gebhardt and Matz-Soja, 2014</a>). Recently, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was recognized as a master regulator of the zonal distribution of nitrogen metabolism in the adult liver (<a href=\"#bib5\">Benhamouche et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gebhardt and Hovhannisyan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Monga, 2015</a>) and it influences the balance between the anabolic and catabolic functions of glucose metabolism (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chafey et al., 2009</a>). The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling cascade is another important pathway that determines embryonic patterning, cell growth and tissue repair (<a href=\"#bib45\">Omenetti et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gu and Xie, 2015</a>), and often acts in close crosstalk with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling (<a href=\"#bib66\">Toku et al., 2011</a>). Similar to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, the Hh pathway can act in canonical and non-canonical manners, as explicitly described by Teperino et al. (<a href=\"#bib65\">Teperino et al., 2014</a>). To activate canonical Hh signaling in mammals, the ligands Sonic, Indian and Desert Hedgehog (SHH, IHH and DHH) interact with the surface receptors Patched 1 and 2 (PTCH1 and PTCH2) which remove their inhibition of the co-receptor Smoothened (SMO). Active SMO triggers the activation of the GLI (Glioma-associated oncogene) transcription factors (TFs) (GLI1, 2 and 3) by preventing the conversion of GLI2 and GLI3 into transcriptional repressors (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ruiz i Altaba, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Infante et al., 2015</a>). According to Ruiz I Altaba et al., the 'Gli-code', i.e. the combinatorial and cooperative function of the repressing and activating forms of all GLI factors, forms the basis of the integration of Hh signals (as well as of multiple other morphogens and cytokines) in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ruiz i Altaba, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ruiz i Altaba et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">2007</a>). To date, Hh signaling has been found to play a considerable role in various scenarios of adult liver regeneration from progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sicklick et al., 2006</a>) and in the regulation of the compensatory outgrowth of progenitors and myofibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jung et al., 2010</a>). Regarding liver metabolism, we recently showed that the regulation of the IGF-axis (insulin-like growth factor) in mature hepatocytes is controlled by Hh signaling (<a href=\"#bib40\">Matz-Soja et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, we were also able to show that the TFs GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 form a unique self-stabilizing network in hepatocytes and regulate several metabolic genes, including lipid associated factors (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schmidt-Heck et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, in this study, we have focused on the alterations in lipid metabolism as a consequence of hepatic Hh signaling modulations in vivo and in vitro. To address this aim, a mouse model with a conditional hepatocyte-specific deletion of <i>Smo</i> in adult mice was established, in order to avoid interference with developmental effects of Hh signaling. For the in vitro\u00a0investigations, we used RNA interference (RNAi) technology to knock down several genes of the Hh pathway in cultured hepatocytes (<a href=\"#bib8\">B\u00f6ttger et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schmidt-Heck et al., 2015</a>). The results of our investigations clearly show that the Hh pathway is a strong regulator of lipid metabolism in the adult liver. Furthermore, we show that impaired Hh signaling leads to increased expression of lipogenic TFs and enzymes with different zonal preference which finally results in steatosis. Conversely, we demonstrate that slight activation of the pathway by Sufu knockdown, small molecule agonists or GLI overexpression can mitigate lipid accumulation in steatotic livers."

During this period, the <i>Smo</i> rec. (recombinant) primer yielded a 350 bp fragment, indicating the deletion of the floxed domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) (Primer: <a href=\"#SD11-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). After 10 days, nearly all hepatocytes were positive for Cre recombinase protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). After this treatment, the mice were maintained under normal conditions until 12 weeks of age. After sacrifice, the specificity of the <i>Smo</i> deletion was measured via qRT-PCR, indicating that there was a significant decrease in <i>Smo</i> expression in the liver material and isolated hepatocytes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). As already shown in our previous article, no adverse side effect of the doxycycline treatment could be observed on body weight (<a href=\"#bib40\">Matz-Soja et al., 2014</a>). Likewise, the expression of important genes of lipid metabolism in hepatocytes was not affected by doxycycline (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The deletion of <i>Smo</i> at 8 weeks of age resulted in pronounced liver steatosis within 5 weeks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The H&amp;E; and fat red staining clearly showed lipid droplet accumulations, which are most prominent in the midzone to periportal zone, but occasionally encompassed the entire parenchyma (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Quantification of the fat red staining revealed a 7-fold increase in the SLC-KO mice compared with the WT controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Because the insulin and glucose levels changed only marginally (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), we conclude that insulin resistance does not contribute to the steatosis in SLC-KO mice at least during the first five weeks after doxycycline administration. This assumption is confirmed by the fact that we could not detect any significant changes in hepatic expression for insulin receptor (<i>Insr</i>), insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (<i>Irs1/2</i>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). With the exception of the steatosis and lower liver/body weight ratio compared with the SLC-WT mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), there were no other indications of overt liver damage in the SLC-KO mice. Accordingly, the serum activities of ASAT (aspartate aminotransferase), ALAT (alanine aminotransferase) and GLDH (glutamate dehydrogenase) were not different from those of the SLC-WT mice (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The plasma triglyceride levels were significantly increased in the VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) fraction, while no changes were found in LDL (low density lipoprotein) and HDL (high density lipoprotein) fractions (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These findings indicate that steatosis is not caused by an impairment of triglyceride secretion from the hepatocytes."

                                "text": "To study the signaling cascade after the deletion of <i>Smo</i>, we analyzed the alterations of Hh-related genes in isolated hepatocytes. Regarding Hh ligands, we could observe a down-regulation of <i>Ihh</i> and <i>Shh,</i> consistent with a decrease in pathway activity due to the deletion of <i>Smo</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). It is worth noting that <i>Ihh</i> is the most abundantly expressed ligand in hepatocytes, whereas <i>Shh</i> is hard to detect and <i>Dhh</i> was not measureable. Regarding the receptors, we did not observe significant changes in the <i>Ptch1, Ptch2</i> and <i>Hhip</i> (Hedgehog-interacting protein) transcripts, which was also true for <i>Fu</i> (Fused) and <i>Sufu</i> (Suppressor of fused) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). However, the <i>Gli1</i> and <i>Gli3</i> mRNAs were significantly decreased in the SLC-KO mice, while the <i>Gli2</i> mRNA remained unchanged (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). To visualize the amount and the distribution of the GLI1 and GLI3 protein in the liver parenchyma of the SLC mice, we performed immunohistological stainings of GLI1 and GLI3 as well. (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). The results clearly demonstrate that GLI1 and GLI3, are well detectable in hepatocyte nuclei in SLC-WT mice, but are absent in nuclei of SLC-KO hepatocytes (white arrows). In SLC-KO livers, these TFs are only present in non-parenchymal cells, e.g. bile duct epithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>, yellow arrowheads). These results were confirmed by analyses of the GLI3 protein content by western blotting in isolated hepatocytes from SLC-WT and SLC-KO mice. The results clearly show that the amount of GLI3/A (full length activator protein) was significantly reduced in SLC-KO hepatocytes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). In order to find out whether these distinct alterations of the GLI factors are characteristic for steatotic livers, we measured the expression signature of the <i>Gli</i> TFs in isolated hepatocytes from melanocortin-4-receptor-deficient mice (MC4R) and Lep<i><sup>ob</sup></i><sup>/<i>ob</i> </sup>mice, which are characterized by massive steatosis as a result of over-nutrition (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sandrock et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Itoh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Trak-Smayra et al., 2011</a>). In both mouse models, the expression of <i>Gli1</i> and <i>Gli3</i> was obviously reduced, whereas <i>Gli2</i> expression either did not change (MC4R-KO mice) or was increased (<i>ob/ob</i> mice) (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Furthermore we could detect the same transcriptional changes of the Gli factors in human patients with clinical relevant steatosis compared to non-steatotic patients (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

In order to account for possible inter-individual variations of gene expression, total RNA was prepared from freshly isolated hepatocytes of four pairs of SLC-KO and SLC-WT mice. At a cut-off level of 1.5-fold, 179 genes were up-regulated in Chip Arrays and 106 genes were down-regulated. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using ClueGO revealed highly significant changes in a number of metabolic functions, particularly those involved in lipid metabolism (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1\u2014data</a>).

In addition, the GSEA revealed that many regulated genes in the SLC-KO mice (e.g. <i>Cd36, Avpr1a, Ttc23, Lifr andFabp2</i>) belong to the top 50 ones described to be mostly correlated with elevated hepatic triglyceride level among 100 unique inbred mouse strains (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hui et al., 2015</a>). The GO term \u2018metabolic process\u2019 showed pronounced up-regulation of 113 genes reaching a p-value of 1.24E-9 indicating that genes from other metabolic processes also responded to the <i>Smo</i> knockout. The GO terms \u2018organic acid metabolic process\u2019 and \u2018steroid biosynthetic process\u2019 showed up-regulation of several genes with p-values of 1.61E-6 and 6.09E-5, respectively.

This network provides an overview of the studied proteins and confirms the observed diverse and highly complex connections of the TFs and enzymes related to lipid metabolism and Hh signaling. PNPLA3 expression is connected to SREBF1 activity, and the PPAR family is linked to the FOXA and GLI TFs. The lipogenic enzymes (e.g. FASN, ACACA/B, ELOVL6, and GPAM) are closely connected to the TF SREBF1 and to each other as part of the fatty acid and triglyceride biosynthetic pathways."

The stronger staining not only confirmed the up-regulation of FASN in the SLC-KO mice, but, surprisingly, revealed a shift from the known pericentral (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gebhardt, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Postic and Girard, 2008</a>) to the periportal localization in the SLC-WT mice, matching the preferential site of lipid accumulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). These results suggest that in addition to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling (<a href=\"#bib5\">Benhamouche et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gebhardt and Hovhannisyan, 2010</a>), Hh signaling is required to maintain the normal zonation of the liver parenchyma, at least with respect to lipid metabolism. Furthermore, we measured the activity of several lipid metabolism pathways in cultured hepatocytes. Fatty acid biosynthesis, as determined by the incorporation of [<sup>14</sup>C]-labelled acetate, was almost doubled in the hepatocytes from the SLC-KO mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). However, cholesterol biosynthesis from labelled acetate was not changed in vitro (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), corresponding to the unchanged serum cholesterol levels <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Interestingly, the hepatocytes from the SLC-KO mice showed a significantly higher rate of fatty acid synthesis from [<sup>14</sup>C(U)]-glucose in the presence of 10\u2009mM glucose and 0.1 \u00b5M insulin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), suggesting increased channeling of the high concentrations of glucose into fatty acid biosynthesis. The fact that neither the glycogen content (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), nor basal or stimulated glycolysis as determined by the conversion of [<sup>14</sup>C(U)]-glucose to lactate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) were altered in the hepatocytes from the re-fed SLC-KO mice, suggests that there is no shortage of potential fuel for glycolytic acetyl-CoA formation."

Therefore, we investigated the impact of the Hh pathway on the mitochondria in hepatocytes. Electron microscopy revealed larger and swollen mitochondria in the SLC-KO mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Further analyses showed significantly reduced ATP levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). However, the activity of the respiratory complexes was not changed (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The expression of carrier proteins (e.g. <i>Cpt1a, Cpt2</i>; Carnitine palmitoyltransferases 1a/2) and enzymes (<i>Acox1</i>, acyl-Coenzyme A oxidase 1, and <i>Acadvl</i>, acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, very long chain) of beta oxidation were also not changed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). Instead, we found the significant decrease of <i>Slc25a5</i> (mitochondrial carrier) expression, which transports ADP and ATP through the mitochondrial inner membrane (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). The fact that no significant changes in the ketone body concentrations could be measured (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>), lead us to speculate that the decrease of <i>SLC25a5</i> could be one explanation of the low ATP production."

Hence, the undisturbed Hh pathway is necessary to maintain the proper balance between the synthesis/uptake and degradation/export of fatty acids and triglycerides in adult hepatocytes (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). These results were confirmed on the metabolic and the transcriptional level. Metabolically, we demonstrated the increased accumulation of triglycerides and the significant increase of VLDL particles, which are a hallmark of hepatic steatosis and NAFLD (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fon Tacer and Rozman, 2011</a>). On the transcriptional level, we showed that a large set of lipogenic TFs and enzymes were significantly up-regulated following the deletion of <i>Smo</i>. Among the responding TFs were <i>Srebf1, Ppara</i> and <i>Pparg</i> strongly increased which are characteristic for liver steatosis (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fabbrini et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ables, 2012</a>). Interestingly, combinatorial interactions between <i>Srepf1, Nfy</i>b and <i>Nfyg</i> (Nuclear transcription factor Y), and <i>Sp1</i> (Transacting transcription factor 1) have been shown to determine the expression of specific sets of target genes, including hundreds of genes with distinct roles in lipid metabolism and other functions (<a href=\"#bib51\">Reed et al., 2008</a>). Especially the role of SREBP1 is further discussed below. Some studies with certain hepatic cells already revealed the contributions of <i>Nfyb/g</i> to the overexpression of lipid metabolizing enzymes and several other metabolic events (<a href=\"#bib71\">Woo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Damiano et al., 2009</a>).

For instance, increased <i>Acaca</i> but not <i>Acacb</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chow et al., 2014</a>) and increased <i>Elovl6</i> expression, particularly when coupled to the down-regulation of <i>Elovl3</i>, should trigger lipogenesis (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jakobsson et al., 2005</a>). The genome-wide dimension of the role of Hh signaling in controlling central transcriptional events of NAFLD formation and progression was revealed by our microarray studies. In particular, the GSEA revealed that many regulated genes in SLC-KO mice belong to the top 50 abundant changed genes associated with NAFLD tested in 100 unique inbred mouse strains (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hui et al., 2015</a>). Intriguingly, one of these changes concerned the increased expression of <i>Pnpla3</i> which has frequently been found to be associated with steatosis where it acts as a downstream gene of SREBP-1c to promote lipid accumulation (<a href=\"#bib61\">Smagris et al., 2015</a>). Our observation that liponeogenesis is further increased in the presence of high glucose concentrations adds another piece of the puzzle. Thus, Hh signaling may also influence carbohydrate metabolism in the presence of excess glucose, possibly by increasing <i>Chrebp</i> expression."

                        "text": "To identify the downstream signaling pathways that lead to the observed lipid accumulations in hepatocytes, we extended our previous work on the Gli TFs, which form a self-stabilizing network in parenchymal cells (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schmidt-Heck et al., 2015</a>). This network mediates the prominent up-regulation of lipogenic TFs (e.g. <i>Ppara, Pparg</i> and <i>Srebf1</i>) when hepatocytes are treated with <i>Gli3</i> siRNA (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schmidt-Heck et al., 2015</a>). In our current study, we revealed additional <i>Gli</i>-dependent transcriptional effects. Even more importantly, we found that the expression of <i>Gli1</i> and <i>Gli3</i> were significantly reduced in the SLC-KO mice. This indicates that a specific transcriptional signature within the <i>Gli</i> TF network which can be termed the 'steatotic Gli-code' lead to the observed steatosis <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>.This signature is characterized by reduced expression of <i>Gli1</i> and <i>Gli3</i>, while <i>Gli2</i> is unchanged (or slightly increased), which can be abbreviated as <i><sub>Gli1</sub>/Gli2/<sub>Gli3</sub></i>. Using different mouse models with strong steatosis by hyperphagy or leptin deficiency (e.g. MC4R and <i>ob/ob</i> mice), we observed the same direction of the regulation of the <i>Gli</i> TF\u2019s. This was also supported by measurements of <i>Gli</i> expression in liver samples from human patients with steatosis. These results indicate that the postulated \u201csteatotic Gli-code\u201d is universal across several strains and species promoting lipid accumulation in hepatocytes regardless of the manner of the etiology of steatosis. Based on the different functional possibilities of the GLI proteins, Ruiz I Altaba has originally postulated the concept of the 'Gli-code', which describes the combinatorial and cooperative function of the GLI transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ruiz i Altaba, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ruiz i Altaba <i>et al.</i>, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">2007</a>). This concept has proven useful in connecting different levels of Hh signaling with the regulation of cell fates and cancer (<a href=\"#bib62\">Stecca and Ruiz i Altaba, 2010</a>). Because the GLI proteins are also regulated by other signaling pathways, e.g. EGFR-MEK/ERK, RAS/AKT, TGF-beta and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling (for review see [<a href=\"#bib19\">Fernandez-Zapico, 2008</a>]), the 'Gli-code' may reflect the outcome of integrating different signaling pathways. Regarding lipid metabolic processes, Suh and co-workers found similar changes in the expression of the <i>Gli</i> factors during adipogenic induction of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib63\">Suh et al., 2006</a>). These similarities lead us to hypothesize that the transition from the normal GLI-code (GLI1/GLI2/GLI3) to the postulated 'steatotic Gli-code' (<sub>GLI1</sub>/GLI2/<sub>GLI3</sub>) provides a novel paradigm for the regulation of lipid metabolism in the liver (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). In case of down-regulated <i>Gli1</i> and <i>Gli3,</i> prominent lipogenic transcription factors (e.g. <i>Ppara/g, Srebf1</i>) are up-regulated and influence an entire network of several genes associated with lipid metabolism which finally ends up with hepatic steatosis (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). This concept is considerably supported by the finding that the combined overexpression of GLI1 and GLI3 (but not of each GLI factor alone) is able to significantly lower the lipid content of hepatocytes from steatotic ob/ob mice."

Unfortunately, we cited only one (Reed et al. 2008) of the many studies that have demonstrated in detail that important enzymatic genes of liver lipid metabolism (e.g. <i>Fasn</i>) are regulated via transcription factors like SREBP1, ChREBP and others. For instance, it was already shown that SREBP1 has binding sites at -7000 bp and -500 bp of the <i>Fasn</i> gene (Amemiya-Kudo et al.; Morishita et al. 2014). Furthermore it was also shown that overexpression of SREBP 1c, an isoform of SREBP1, lead to the significant upregulation of <i>Fasn</i> gene expression in hepatocytes (Dentin et al. 2004). Obviously, SREBP1 does not act alone but in combination with several other TFs such as the NFYs and SP1 (Reed et al. 2008). For ChREBP the situation is similar (Morishita et al. 2014). Apart from these major publications a lot of additional evidence in favor of such regulation was published by many other groups (reviewed in (Postic und Girard 2008; Morishita et al. 2014), although mainly in adipose tissue. Thus, we think that giving enough credit to this work in our manuscript should sufficiently answer the point raised by the reviewers even for the specific case of the liver."

However, from the fact that the serum concentrations of insulin in SLC mice obviously were not changed due to the Smo-KO (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), we concluded that insulin resistance is not associated with the steatosis in SLC-KO mice. This view is further supported by additional parameters of insulin signalling in the SLC model. For instance, we have measured the expression of insulin receptor (<i>Inrs</i>), insulin receptor substrate 1 (<i>Irs1</i>) and insulin receptor substrate 2 (<i>Irs2</i>) via qRT-PCR and found no significant differences. Furthermore, we have performed GTT (glucose tolerance tests) and an ITT (insulin tolerance test) in male SAC mice (a slightly different model to SLC-KO mice) and found no differences between KO and WT animals. Collectively, these results make it rather unlikely that the SLC-KO mice suffer from insulin resistance, at least during the first 5 weeks after <i>Smo</i> knockout."

This is important, since Hh signalling is heterogeneously distributed in liver parenchyma (Gebhardt und Matz-Soja 2014)(Gebhardt und Matz-Soja 2014). The results clearly demonstrate that both transcription factors, GLI1 and GLI3, are well detectable in hepatocyte nuclei in SLC-WT animals, but are absent in nuclei of SLC-KO hepatocytes.
