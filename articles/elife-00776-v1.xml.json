We conducted a metabolomic QTL analysis on a reciprocal RIL population structured to examine how variation in the organelle genomes affects phenotypic variation. This showed that the cytoplasmic variation had effects similar to, if not larger than, the largest individual nuclear locus. Inclusion of cytoplasmic variation into the genetic model greatly increased the explained phenotypic variation. Cytoplasmic genetic variation was a central hub in the epistatic network controlling the plant metabolome. This epistatic influence manifested such that the cytoplasmic background could alter or hide pairwise epistasis between nuclear loci. Thus, cytoplasmic genetic variation plays a central role in controlling natural variation in metabolomic networks. This suggests that cytoplasmic genomes must be included in any future analysis of natural variation."

A key facet to this effort is to develop models that would allow directly inferring a species phenotypic variation from its genetic variation. This goal of mathematically linking genetic to phenotypic variation is central to all studies of quantitative genetics ranging from human genetics to plant breeding to ecology and has led to massive genome resequencing projects focused on developing the genomic databases to allow these studies (<a href=\"#bib45\">Liti et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Altshuler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cao et al., 2011</a>). However, in most quantitative genomics studies, genome analysis is largely confined to the nuclear genome with much less attention paid to the organellar genome. This is in contrast to the central role that the organellar genome plays in controlling organismal metabolism and function and the developing body of literature suggesting that organellar genomic variation can modulate the effects of nuclear genomic variation."

However, these organellar variants are typically rare with large phenotypic consequences such that they can be followed using simple maternal inheritance studies without consideration for quantitative variation in the nuclear genome (<a href=\"#bib63\">Schon et al., 2012</a>). More recently, quantitative studies on human diseases suggest that genetic variation in organellar genomes modify the quantitative effect of nuclear loci and disease phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Battersby and Shoubridge, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">McRae et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Schon and Przedborski, 2011</a>). Additionally, the use of structured populations in mice, yeast, and birds have shown that cytoplasmic genome variation can influence high order phenotypes including fitness, cognition, and biomass (<a href=\"#bib59\">Roubertoux et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Zeyl et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Park et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dimitrov et al., 2009</a>).

Plant breeding has a long history of using diallele crosses to test for the presence of maternal effects (cytoplasmic genetic variation) on a phenotype and this was recently extended to a small reciprocal F2 family structure to show that the cytoplasmic effects could have significant impacts on plant height in maize (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tang et al., 2013</a>). In rice, agronomic traits have also been shown to be influenced by interactions between cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes but the specific loci were not identified (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tao et al., 2004</a>). However, these reciprocal F2 populations typically have generated the impression that cytoplasmic effects on phenotypic variation are quite small in plants possibly because of an inability to account for interactions between the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes (<a href=\"#bib65\">Singh, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Crane and Nyquist, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Eenink and Garretsen, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Miura et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Primomo et al., 2002</a>). In contrast to the previous estimates of small effects, genomic sequencing within Arabidopsis has shown the presence of considerable genetic polymorphism in both the plastidic and mitochondrial genomes suggesting the potential for broad phenotypic consequences (<a href=\"#bib52\">Moison et al., 2010</a>)."

We focused on metabolomics because it is cost effective for large sample numbers and because plant organelles, mitochondria and plastids, are central to the function of plant primary metabolism, as well as many specialized metabolites in both energy generation and biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fiehn et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Roessner et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fiehn, 2002</a>). Within Arabidopsis, there are nearly 13,000 genes in the nuclear genome predicted to be involved in metabolic processes of which \u223c3000 may be targeted to the mitochondria and the plastid (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arabidopsis genome initiative, 2000</a>). This included complete biosynthetic pathways for numerous amino acids and key energy production processes like respiration and photosynthesis. Aiding these processes are 88 total predicted genes in the plastidic genome and 121 in the mitochondrial genome; most of which function to facilitate the metabolic processes that occur in organelles using both nuclear and cytoplasmic-encoded proteins. Thus, variation in the organellar genomes could directly influence the function of any of nuclear gene functioning within the organelle (<a href=\"#bib22\">Etterson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Wolf, 2009</a>). This suggests that metabolism is an ideal phenotype to use for testing how cytoplasmic variation can influence phenotypic variation."

This population was generated from a reciprocal cross and approximately half of the resulting lines carry Kas organelles while the other half carry Tsu organelles allowing for explicit analysis of the influence of cytoplasmic genetic variation (<a href=\"#bib48\">McKay et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Juenger et al., 2010</a>). Analysis of the Kas \u00d7 Tsu RIL population metabolome showed that genetic variation in the organelles influenced the accumulation of over 80% of the detectable metabolites. In contrast to previous observations suggesting that the cytoplasm has only small effects, phenotypic changes associated with cytoplasmic variation were as large and often larger than that found for individual nuclear loci (<a href=\"#bib65\">Singh, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Crane and Nyquist, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Eenink and Garretsen, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Miura et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Primomo et al., 2002</a>). In addition, the cytoplasm was found to be a central hub in the epistatic network controlling natural variation in plant metabolism. This centrality led to the cytoplasmic background displaying the unexpected ability to hide or alter epistatic interactions between nuclear loci. Thus, genetic variation in the cytoplasmic organelles has widespread and large quantitative effects on natural phenotypic variation and can influence the link between nuclear loci."

                                "text": "Classical breeding studies utilize reciprocal crosses with linear modeling to partition heritability between the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes (<a href=\"#bib65\">Singh, 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Crane and Nyquist, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Eenink and Garretsen, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Miura et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Primomo et al., 2002</a>). In line with the standard heritability calculations for classical breeding experiments with reciprocal crosses, we used a linear modeling approach to approximate the level of heritability in this population that can be statistically ascribed to the nuclear and cytoplasmic genome. The line heritability model simply partitions the RILs into two subpopulations based on the maternal parent and tests the level of reproducibility that is controlled by differences between the lines and between the subpopulations. Using the line heritability model, we focused on the 559 metabolites found in both experiments to estimate the broad sense heritability of the metabolome. This analysis showed that 361 metabolites had a significant (p&lt;0.01) line effect, of which 334 metabolites showed significant heritability based on the maternal parent subpopulation. This maternal effect was quite small with an average of 1.6 \u00b1 0.1% (range 15\u20130%) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). In comparison, 77 metabolites had significant nuclear broad sense heritability with an average of 21.3 \u00b1 0.3% (range 58\u20132%) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). This is a similar level of variation to that found in a previous analysis of metabolomic variation in Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rowe et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chan et al., 2010</a>). The combined variance of the genetic components, both nuclear and cytoplasmic, explained approximately 19 times as much of the variance as the combination of experiment and block (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rowe et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chan et al., 2010</a>). This raises an apparent disparity between the nuclear genome having high heritability that is significant for a low fraction of metabolites (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). In contrast, the cytoplasmic effects have relatively low average heritability but significantly impact most metabolites (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). The most likely explanation for this disparity is the large difference in the degrees of freedom for the two factors, nuclear vs cytoplasmic used for the significance test. When conducting the ANOVA test, there are only two maternal subpopulations, Kas or Tsu, whereas there are 316 different nuclear genomes/RILs, and as such, the F value for the same level of variance will be very different in the two tests (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rowe and Kliebenstein, 2008</a>). Thus, variation in most metabolites identifies a significant effect of cytoplasmic genetic variation, even though this effect appears to be smaller than that for the nuclear genome in the standard line heritability estimation approach."

In comparison to the broader question of cytoplasmic heritability tested in the line heritability model (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>), this model allows us to ask the more specific question of how the cytoplasmic variation compares to individual nuclear loci in altering metabolite accumulation. The additive model showed that variation in the cytoplasmic genome significantly altered variation in 1755 out of the 2435 detected metabolites. This is in comparison the nuclear loci that only affected 298 metabolites on average (range 438\u2013158). In addition to affecting more metabolites than nuclear loci, the average effect size of the cytoplasmic genome on metabolite variation was higher than that for the nuclear loci (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

In this figure, we present the distribution of the per marker and per interaction heritability for each marker/interaction based on metabolites that are significant for that marker/interaction. The two plots titled \u2018main\u2019 and \u2018main trim\u2019 that show the heritability solely attributable to the individual main effect nuclear and cytoplasmic loci. \u2018main\u2019 shows the full plot while \u2018main_trim\u2019 shows the distribution trimmed to improve the resolution on the nuclear markers. The plot entitled \u2018cytonuclear\u2019 shows the distribution of the heritability attributed to all significant interactions between the cytoplasmic genome and the listed nuclear locus.

Interestingly, the number of genes within a 5 cM region surrounding the nuclear hotspots is comparable to the number of genes present within the combined organellar genomes, which suggests that this is not simply a matter of genetic potential. Additionally, the Kas allele of both the nuclear and cytoplasmic loci were more frequently associated with increasing metabolite concentration leading to a change in the entire metabolic network within this population based on the cytoplasmic genome (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4 and 5</a>). Thus, the line heritability approach to partitioning genetic variation dramatically underestimated the effect of cytoplasmic genetic variation and cytoplasmic variation has larger effects than any individual nuclear locus even though there are a similar potential number of causative genes."

This analysis showed that there were polymorphisms spread out across a large number of genes including regulatory genes, such as <i>rpoC2</i> in the plastid, several unknown genes, and key energy genes, such as Rubisco large subunit. The most striking changes were the large number of polymorphisms within the NADH deyhdrogenases in both the mitochondria and the plastid (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). Specifically in the mitochondria, 32 of the 96 polymorphisms were within the NADH dehydrogenase 7 and a further 13 polymorphisms in four other NADH dehydrogenase complex genes. This is vastly more polymorphisms than would be expected by random chance suggesting a change in NADH and related metabolism between the Kas and Tsu organelles (hyper-geometric test, p&lt;0.001). This agrees with the widespread metabolic consequences of the cytoplasmic genetic variation on processes that require NADH like glutamine synthesis, lipid metabolism, and any other process that utilizes NADH requiring cytochromes P450. However, within this population the mitochondrial and plastidic genomes are perfectly co-inherited making it impossible to resolve the individual effects of the mitochondrial and plastidic genomes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Joseph et al., 2013</a>). Additionally, it isn\u2019t possible to ascribe metabolites to specific subcellular compartments using a whole tissue extract as most metabolites, even those synthesized in specific compartments, often accumulate in most compartments within a plant cell (<a href=\"#bib40\">Krueger et al., 2011</a>). Thus, genetic variation in the cytoplasm can have significant effects on modulating global plant metabolism requiring further work to identify the specific mechanistic causes."

To test for cytonuclear epistatic interactions, we used a pairwise epistasis model that directly tested all pairwise combinations of the 14 nuclear QTL and cytoplasm against all metabolites while including all terms from the additive model (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">2</a>). This pairwise epistasis model only uses 120 of the 314 available degrees of freedom (38%) leaving the majority of the degrees of freedom for the residual variance, which suggests that we are not over fitting the model. We did not extend this analysis to a full genome survey of all possible loci because these surveys do not account for existing main effect loci. After multiple testing adjustments, we only plotted pairwise interactions that significantly affected at least 10% of the metabolites to present a conservative image of the interaction network (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

We utilized the center of mass concept from physics to generate a description of epistatic effect (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gartenhaus and Schwartz, 1957</a>). In center of mass calculations across two dimensions, each individual objects mass is described in its x,y coordinates. For describing epistasis, we converted the x,y-cartography such that the alleles for one QTL with Tsu being -1 and Kas being 1 are along the x-axis. Similarly, along the y-axis are the alleles at the second QTL thus creating a calculable genotypic cartography (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). This effectively replaces the physical distance metric in the center of mass calculation with a genetic distance metric such that they represent a scaled allelic effect. We then replace the individual objects mass the in center of mass calculations with the unscaled average phenotypic value for each of the homozygous genotypic combinations of the two QTLs allowing a genetic centroid of the phenotype to be estimated for each metabolite and plotted (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). This allows a single plot to compare the magnitude of epistasis and the allelic direction across multiple metabolites (Please see the materials and methods for a more detailed description of this approach and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for a representative model plot)."

To quantify how much the inclusion of the cytoplasm improved the genetic models in describing metabolomic variation, we analyzed our additive and pairwise epistasis model models with and without the cytoplasmic terms. For each metabolite for each model, we estimated the percent of variance explained by the significant terms in the model (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This showed that including the cytoplasmic genome in the additive model nearly doubled the average variance compared to additive model containing only the nuclear loci. Adding the pairwise epistatic terms to the additive model without the cytoplasmic genome nearly tripled the fraction of metabolite variance explained by the genetic model without over-fitting the model (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Including the cytoplasmic genome into the pairwise model shifted the average model genetic variance from 38% to 53% (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Thus, the inclusion of the cytoplasmic term into the pairwise model explained as much (15%), if not more, variance than could be explained from the simple additive model built with only nuclear loci (13%) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This shows that the cytoplasmic genetic variation is critical to being able to fully describe metabolomic variation within Arabidopsis."

This connectivity between the cytoplasmic genetic variation and nuclear QTL epistatic pairs led us to question if genetic variation in the cytoplasmic genomes could alter epistatic interactions between nuclear loci. To test if cytoplasmic genetic variation could alter nuclear epistasis, we identified all pairs of nuclear loci that interacted with each other and the cytoplasmic genome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). These 10 three-way interactions were then included in the pairwise epistatic model to generate a three-way interaction model (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1,2</a>).

Thus, we used the reciprocal Kas \u00d7 Tsu Arabidopsis RIL population to directly quantify the role of cytoplasmic genetic variation in quantitative variation of metabolomics traits. Our analysis showed that the cytoplasmic genome variation affected the phenotypic variation for over 80% of metabolites. The affected metabolites included key parts of central metabolism and some of the most specialized metabolites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 5 and 6</a>). Interestingly, the combined variance of the nuclear genome was larger than the variance due to cytoplasmic genome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In contrast, cytoplasmic genetic variation affected more metabolites than any of the individual nuclear loci typically with larger effects (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3\u20135</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1\u20135</a>).

This cytonuclear epistasis explained as much, if not more, metabolic variation than the combined additive effects of the nuclear loci. In addition, the cytoplasmic genome controlled larger phenotypic changes than the nuclear locus within a cytonuclear interaction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This interaction between the cytoplasmic and nuclear loci was further extended to three-way interactions and showed that the cytoplasmic background could hide or alter the interaction between two nuclear loci (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Thus, the cytoplasmic genetic background plays a key role in determining how natural variation within nuclear loci will function."

Thus, organellar genomes could be playing a role in the cytoplasmic genetic influence on metabolite variation, but given their coinheritance, it is not possible to resolve the direct causal polymorphisms.

This could be from genetic polymorphisms in organellar genes that are central to plant metabolism, such as those central to photosynthesis or NADH synthesis (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). Alternatively, the polymorphisms could be within the organellar genes that are required to facilitate the function of the several thousand nuclear genes whose protein products are transported into the organelles and function there (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ajjawi et al., 2010</a>). Finally, it is possible that the polymorphisms in the organelle impact retrograde signaling pathways, thus altering the function of the nuclear regulatory mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib71\">Vinti et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Larkin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Estavillo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Xiao et al., 2012</a>). Identifying the specific causal polymorphisms within the cytoplasmic genomes will require direct whole genome sequencing of the organellar genomes from all available genotypes to query the extent of natural variation in the organellar genome (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cao et al., 2011</a>). An alternative may be to identify the causal genes underlying the nuclear loci involved in three-way interactions with the cytoplasm to triangulate the identity of the cytoplasmic gene."

Cytoplasmic genetic variation alters metabolite variation with effects that are equivalent to, if not greater than, individual nuclear loci. More importantly, the cytoplasmic background significantly influences the ability to detect epistasis between nuclear loci. Thus cytoplasmic genomes should be included in any future analysis of natural variation, either by being included as a genotype in GWA studies or by designing future populations as reciprocal populations to allow for direct analysis of the cytoplasmic genomic variation in controlling the phenotype. This inclusion will allow direct assessment of how cytoplasmic genomic variation influences other phenotypic classes, such as transcriptomics or broader physiological phenotypes. Natural genetic variation in the organellar genomes while frequently ignored will have to be kept at the front of future experimental approaches designed to understand the evolution and genetic architecture of organismal phenotypes."

We grew a total of four to five plants per line, split into two randomized complete blocks per experiment with two independent experiments separated by approximately 3 months. This provides four independent replicates per genotype. We grew plants in large planting trays with 156 individual wells (b \u00d7 w \u00d7 h: 30 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 100 mm), filled with standard potting soil (Sunshine Mix #1, Sun Gro Horticulture, Bellevue WA). Prior to sowing, we imbibed seeds in distilled water and cold stratified them at 4\u00b0C for 4 days. We placed approximately 3\u20135 seeds of a single genotype in the center of a well and covered the trays with a transparent plastic hood to retain humidity during germination. Plants from both reciprocal subpopulations where intermixed in the block design to allow direct statistical testing of cytoplasmic effects. After 1 week, we removed the transparent hoods and surplus plants to leave one seedling per well. We watered plants twice a week with nutrient-enriched water (0.5% N-P-K fertilizer in a 2-1-2 ratio, Grow More 4-18-38, Grow More Inc., Gardena CA) and kept them in a climate-controlled chamber at 22\u00b0C and a day/night cycle of 10 hr/14 hr.

The ion count values were used as a surrogate for metabolite abundance. Metabolite abundance was median normalized prior to analysis to account for any technical variation between samples. A separate leaf was extracted for glucosinolates and analyzed by HPLC according to previously described methods with the results reported elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kliebenstein et al., 2001a</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">b</a>). From the analysis of glucosinolates, a set of 10 lines with aberrant or genetically impossible glucosinolate profiles based on the known parentage were removed from the analysis, leaving a total 316 lines."

The other available short read archive sequences did not provide us sufficient coverage on the organellar genomes to call polymorphisms. The second reason is genetic in that all published literature on the Arabidopsis organellar genetic variation using targeted gene analysis shows that the organelles do not show any evidence of independent assortment and instead they behave in a more clonal fashion which greatly complicates any potential for GWA as the entire organelles are essentially within complete LD. The final reason is for clarity, as the reviewers have rightly noted, we need to improve the manuscript\u2019s clarity and adding a completely additional section on accessions and the organelles would require the equivalent of a full manuscript\u2019s worth of analysis to assess the link between the organelle and population structure, LD, and then finally GWA with metabolites.
