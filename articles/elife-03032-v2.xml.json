Here, we report that miRNAs also serve as a surveillance system to repress the expression of nonsense mRNAs that may produce harmful truncated proteins. Upon recognition of the premature termination codon by the translating ribosome, the downstream portion of the coding region of an mRNA is redefined as part of the 3\u2032 untranslated region; as a result, the miRNA-responsive elements embedded in this region can be detected by miRNAs, triggering accelerated mRNA deadenylation and translational inhibition. We demonstrate that naturally occurring cancer-causing <i>APC</i> (adenomatous polyposis coli) nonsense mutants which escape nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) are repressed by miRNA-mediated surveillance. In addition, we show that miRNA-mediated surveillance and exon\u2013exon junction complex-mediated NMD are not mutually exclusive and act additively to enhance the repressive activity. Therefore, we have uncovered a new role for miRNAs in repressing nonsense mutant mRNAs."

Exome sequencing was performed to identify all PTC-containing mutants in the genome of HCT-116 cells. Genes with the PTC/WT allele reads ratio between 0.7 and 1.3 were considered to be heterozygous. Transcriptome sequencing data were then analyzed to evaluate the effect of these heterozygous PTCs on mRNA stability. Sequencing reads that specifically mapped to the PTC and wild-type allele were counted and used to calculate the relative concentration of the respective transcripts. In total, 47 heterozygous PTC-containing mRNAs predicted from the genomic sequence were actively expressed in HCT-116 cells, as shown in the list. Candidates were subdivided into EJC-NMD-sensitive and/or miRNA-mediated surveillance-sensitive groups according to the position of the PTC. miREs in the PTC-STOP region of each candidate were predicted based on the 2\u20137 seed match rule and the top 150 expressed miRNAs in HCT-116 cells. Candidates highlighted in yellow were selected for experimental validation. Candidates that contain at least one experimentally verified miRE are shown in red font.",

Here, we report that miRNAs also serve as a surveillance system to repress the expression of nonsense mRNAs that may produce harmful truncated proteins. Upon recognition of the premature termination codon by the translating ribosome, the downstream portion of the coding region of an mRNA is redefined as part of the 3\u2032 untranslated region; as a result, the miRNA-responsive elements embedded in this region can be detected by miRNAs, triggering accelerated mRNA deadenylation and translational inhibition. We demonstrate that naturally occurring cancer-causing <i>APC</i> (adenomatous polyposis coli) nonsense mutants which escape nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) are repressed by miRNA-mediated surveillance. In addition, we show that miRNA-mediated surveillance and exon\u2013exon junction complex-mediated NMD are not mutually exclusive and act additively to enhance the repressive activity. Therefore, we have uncovered a new role for miRNAs in repressing nonsense mutant mRNAs."

Exome sequencing was performed to identify all PTC-containing mutants in the genome of HCT-116 cells. Genes with the PTC/WT allele reads ratio between 0.7 and 1.3 were considered to be heterozygous. Transcriptome sequencing data were then analyzed to evaluate the effect of these heterozygous PTCs on mRNA stability. Sequencing reads that specifically mapped to the PTC and wild-type allele were counted and used to calculate the relative concentration of the respective transcripts. In total, 47 heterozygous PTC-containing mRNAs predicted from the genomic sequence were actively expressed in HCT-116 cells, as shown in the list. Candidates were subdivided into EJC-NMD-sensitive and/or miRNA-mediated surveillance-sensitive groups according to the position of the PTC. miREs in the PTC-STOP region of each candidate were predicted based on the 2\u20137 seed match rule and the top 150 expressed miRNAs in HCT-116 cells. Candidates highlighted in yellow were selected for experimental validation. Candidates that contain at least one experimentally verified miRE are shown in red font.",

Although many of the mutations are benign, a high number of mutations have detrimental consequences. Among these mutations, the nonsense mutation is a severe type that converts a coding codon into a stop codon, leading to the premature termination of translation and the expression of proteins truncated at the carboxyl terminus. These truncated protein products often have deleterious dominant-negative or gain-of-function effects that interfere with normal biological processes in cells. Indeed, many inherited genetic disorders, such as \u03b2-thalassemia (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chang and Kan, 1979</a>) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<a href=\"#bib22\">Koenig et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Monaco et al., 1988</a>), are caused by germline nonsense mutations. Moreover, nonsense mutations in critical tumor suppressor genes are associated with prevalent cancer types such as breast cancer (<a href=\"#bib28\">Miki et al., 1994</a>) and colorectal cancer (<a href=\"#bib34\">Powell et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rowan et al., 2000</a>). A recent large-scale genome-wide study revealed that even healthy individuals carry dozens of nonsense mutations (<a href=\"#bib25\">MacArthur et al., 2012</a>). In addition, transcriptional errors, mis-splicing, or even alternative splicing (<a href=\"#bib7\">Danckwardt et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lewis et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wollerton et al., 2004</a>) also frequently lead to nonsense mutations. Accordingly, cells have evolved a surveillance system known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) to eliminate these aberrant transcripts."

One well known mechanism for recognizing premature termination codon (PTC)-containing transcripts is exon\u2013exon junction complex (EJC)-dependent NMD (EJC-NMD). During splicing, a multi-protein EJC complex is deposited at the 5\u2032 side of each exon\u2013exon junction, which is subsequently displaced by the translating ribosome during the pioneer round of translation. An EJC will remain bound to the mRNA and trigger NMD efficiently if the ribosome stalls at a PTC located at least 50 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the final exon\u2013exon junction (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maquat, 2004</a>). However, nonsense transcripts that originate from naturally intronless genes are immune to EJC-NMD, as are transcripts with PTCs located within the last exon or less than 50 nt upstream of the last exon\u2013exon junction. Other EJC-independent NMD mechanisms, such as long 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Buhler et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Eberle et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Singh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hogg and Goff, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zund et al., 2013</a>) and upstream open reading frames (uORFs) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Matsui et al., 2007</a>) are also involved in the degradation of PTC-containing mRNAs.

By imperfectly base-pairing with miRNA-responsive elements (miREs) in target mRNAs (primarily through nucleotides 2\u20137, the seed region of the miRNA), miRNAs exert their repressive effects by promoting RNA degradation through accelerated deadenylation and/or by inhibiting translation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wu and Belasco, 2008b</a>).

By contrast, reports of miRNAs efficiently targeting ORFs are sparse (<a href=\"#bib10\">Duursma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Forman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tay et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Huang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Schnall-Levin et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, recent studies describing the transcriptome-wide identification of miREs revealed prevalent RISC binding in the coding region (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hafner et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Helwak et al., 2013</a>), raising a fascinating question about the biological significance of these ORF miREs. Previously, we have shown that miRNAs cause expedited removal of the poly(A) tails from their mRNA targets through the recognition of miREs in the 3\u2032 UTR. By accelerating this initial and rate-limiting step of mRNA decay, miRNAs efficiently reduce the cellular concentration of their target mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Theoretically, premature translation termination at a nonsense mutation should cause the ORF region downstream of the PTC to acquire a 3\u2032 UTR identity. If any functional miRE is located within this redefined 3\u2032 UTR region, this nonsense mRNA may become miRNA-sensitive and be subject to rapid miRNA-mediated deadenylation and then decay. In this manner, miRNAs could serve as a surveillance system against nonsense mRNAs."

                                "text": "To test this hypothesis, we used a transiently inducible \u03b2-globin (BG) reporter system and a well-established transcriptional pulse-chase assay to analyze the effect of a PTC on mRNA deadenylation in human cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Shyu et al., 1989</a>). Briefly, transcription was induced by removing tetracycline (tet) from the culture medium for a short period so as to obtain a nearly homogeneous population of BG mRNAs that subsequently underwent synchronous deadenylation and degradation. RNA samples collected at different time points after induction were subjected to site-specific cleavage by RNase H to produce 3\u2032 BG mRNA fragments which facilitate accurate measurement of the poly(A) tail length via gel electrophoresis and Northern blotting. The natural sequence of BG mRNA does not harbor any miREs; therefore, we first modified the reporter by inserting a let-7a miRE sequence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) in-frame into the ORF of the last exon to create LastEx-L7. We found that this insertion did not significantly accelerate poly(A) shortening in HeLa-tTA cells, where let-7a is naturally abundant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, compare LastEx-L7 and TBG). This result indicates that ORF miREs are not functionally efficient. Interestingly, a point mutation (<span class=\"underline\">A</span>AA to <span class=\"underline\">T</span>AA) in the last exon that introduced a PTC 16 nt upstream of the let-7a miRE of LastEx-L7 (LastEx-PTC-L7) significantly accelerated the shortening of the 3\u2032 fragment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, upper portion, compare LastEx-L7 and LastEx-PTC-L7, time points 3 and 4.5), but not the 5\u2032 fragment, of BG mRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, bottom portion), a finding indicative of expedited poly(A) removal. Furthermore, treatment of the RNA samples with oligo(dT) and RNase H caused the BG 3\u2032 fragments that previously appeared as diffuse bands after electrophoresis to migrate uniformly to a position corresponding to fully deadenylated mRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), which constitutes additional evidence that the decrease in the length of BG 3\u2032 fragments was due to trimming of the poly(A) tails. The expedited deadenylation disappeared when the let-7a miRE was mutated (LastEx-PTC-L7M), indicating that the rapid poly(A) removal was specifically induced by endogenous let-7a in the cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). As a consequence of accelerated deadenylation, the BG mRNA bearing both the let-7a miRE and the upstream PTC decayed much faster than counterparts that lacked the PTC or the let-7a miRE or bore the mutant let-7a miRE, with the half-life decreasing from &gt;6 hr to &lt;3 hr (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). LastEx-L7 decayed slightly faster than the control BG mRNAs (TBG and LastEx-PTC), which suggests that the miRE located in the ORF may still have residual activity. Similarly, the deadenylation rate of another BG reporter with a PTC located 11 nt upstream of the last exon\u2013exon junction was also accelerated in a miRNA-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, compare PTC102-L7 and PTC102-L7M, time points 1.5, 3, and 4.5). Expedited poly(A) shortening was not observed for BG mRNA bearing the PTC in the last exon or 11 nt upstream of the last exon\u2013exon junction but no downstream miRE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, LastEx-PTC and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, PTC102), because the PTC alone is unable to trigger EJC-NMD when located in the last exon or less than 50 nt upstream of the last exon\u2013exon junction. Similar results were obtained with BG reporters containing one miR-21 miRE (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a> and data not shown), providing evidence that miRNA-mediated deadenylation of nonsense mRNAs is not miRNA-type-specific."

Recent studies suggest that intron retention, a splicing event that often creates PTCs, functions as a general mechanism that controls the expression of many genes in the cells (<a href=\"#bib15\">Galante et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yap et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wong et al., 2013</a>). We speculated that the PTC-containing transcripts generated by intron retention could also be targeted by miRNAs. To test this possibility, we generated a BG reporter (TBG-IR-L7) by mutating the splicing sites in the last intron of LastEx-L7, which abolished the splicing of the last intron and created a PTC 505 nt upstream of the let-7a miRE. As expected, we found that TBG-IR-L7 underwent rapid deadenylation in a miRNA-dependent manner; and that absence of the downstream miRE (TBG-IR) or mutations in the miRE seed region (TBG-IR-L7M) completely abolished this accelerated deadenylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Interestingly, TBG-IR is deadenylated slightly faster than wild-type TBG, probably due to the presence of potential miREs in the longer region between the PTC and the native stop codon (570 nt) that resulted from intron retention; these miREs may be recognized by the highly expressed endogenous miRNAs in HeLa-tTA cells, such as miR-10a/b and miR-17/20a (data not shown). Collectively, these observations demonstrate that a PTC, introduced either by point mutation or alternative splicing, is able to potentiate miRNA-mediated rapid deadenylation of the mRNA by unmasking ORF miREs downstream of it."

The PTC may serve as a roadblock to stop ribosomes and mark the new boundary between the ORF and 3\u2032 UTR. We speculated that blocking translation would cause the miRE within the ORF to behave as if it were in the 3\u2032 UTR and efficiently trigger accelerated miRNA-mediated mRNA deadenylation, even in the absence of an upstream PTC. To test this hypothesis, we placed a large stem-loop structure at the 5\u2032 UTR of LastEx-L7 (hp-LastEx-L7) to block translation initiation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and examined its deadenylation rate. As expected, blocking translation in this manner caused LastEx-L7 mRNA, which normally is deadenylated and decays slowly, to undergo rapid miRNA-mediated deadenylation and decay (half-life of &gt;6 hr vs &lt;3 hr) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), suggesting that translating ribosomes may indeed have interfered with miRNA-RISC binding to the miREs located in the ORF and thus masked their repressive function. Similar results were obtained with another set of BG reporters containing a miR-21 miRE (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Together, these data suggest that miRNAs selectively accelerate the deadenylation of nonsense mRNAs by stably binding to miREs in the ORF downstream of the PTC. The immunity of PTC-free mRNA to miRNA-mediated repression may be due to masking of ORF miREs by the translating ribosomes, which is consistent with a previous study using constitutively transcribed luciferase reporters (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gu et al., 2009</a>)."

In this construct, the original stop codon of the luciferase ORF served as a PTC.

Measurement of the steady-state mRNA level by qRT-PCR showed specific and significant repression of TAA-2E in the presence of miR-125b (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), observations consistent with the results of the BG deadenylation assay shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>.

The top 45 miRNA candidates were chosen for the screening based on their general abundance in human tissues and the predicted thermal stability of the duplex they may form with an <i>APC</i> miRE. For each miRNA selected, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with the luciferase reporter plasmid and a synthetic miRNA mimic or a control small RNA, and examined protein production by measuring luciferase activity 36 hr after transfection. A decrease in luciferase activity when co-transfected with a miRNA mimic would indicate that the selected miRNA may have the potential to repress PTC-containing <i>APC</i> (PTC-<i>APC</i>) expression through miRE(s) in the PTC-STOP region. Using this method, we identified several miRNAs with a strong repressive effect (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), although others that are naturally highly expressed in HEK293 cells even without transfection may have been missed. To verify that the repression is due to the direct interaction between the selected miRNA and an miRE in the PTC-<i>APC</i> mRNA, we mapped the corresponding miREs of the miRNAs via the 2\u20137 seed match alignment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and then inserted the \u223c30-nt-long sequence surrounding the predicted miREs into the 3\u2032 UTR of a luciferase reporter. Multiple miREs exhibited specific responses to the cognate miRNAs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), which verifies their functionality. To further confirm the repressive effect of these miRNAs on PTC-<i>APC</i> mRNA in its natural sequence context, we constructed minigene vectors that express both an HA-tagged PTC-<i>APC</i> bearing either a wild-type miRE or a mutant miRE with mismatches in the seed region and an HA-tagged <i>EGFP</i> that served as an internal control for more precise protein quantification. The minigene plasmids were co-transfected with cognate miRNA mimics into HEK293 cells. Western blotting revealed a marked increase in protein expression for the minigene constructs with mutant miREs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

Western blotting showed that, in the context of the natural <i>APC</i> 3\u2032 UTR, the PTC was still able to potentiate repression by miR-29a miREs originally located in the ORF (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, to quantify the relationship between unmasked ORF miREs and pre-existing miREs in the 3\u2032 UTR, we designed chimeric reporters in which the PTC-STOP region and the entire 3\u2032 UTR of <i>APC</i> mRNA were fused to the 3\u2032 end of a firefly luciferase ORF. The miR-29a miREs in the PTC-STOP region and a miR-135b miRE in the 3\u2032 UTR of <i>APC</i> mRNA that had previously been reported to be functional (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nagel et al., 2008</a>) were mutated, either individually or simultaneously. In the presence of both miRNAs, the wild-type chimeric reporter was repressed most efficiently, while mutating either the ORF miREs or the 3\u2032 UTR miRE alleviated the repression (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These observations indicate that ORF miREs unmasked by an upstream PTC are fully functional in the presence of repression by 3\u2032 UTR miREs."

Our previous luciferase reporter- and minigene-based assays have identified that two miR-29a miREs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>) are present in the PTC-STOP region of <i>APC</i> nonsense mRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). Interestingly, the seed regions of the miR-29a miREs embedded in the <i>APC</i> ORF are highly conserved across several species. Therefore, miREs of miR-29a were selected for subsequent investigations. SW480 is a colorectal cell line that naturally expresses a truncated APC protein (caused by a PTC mutation at codon 1338) that can be readily detected by Western blotting with a specific antibody (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), and high levels of endogenous miR-29a (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4B,D</a>), which render it a suitable cell line to investigate the repression mediated by miR-29a on the endogenous <i>APC</i> nonsense mutant. We transduced SW480 cells with lentiviruses encoding a TuD miRNA decoy (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>), which has been proven a very effective and specific antagonizer of miRNAs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Haraguchi et al., 2009</a>), to inhibit endogenous miR-29a. TuD-expressing cells were cultured for 3 days before APC was examined by Western blotting. An approximate twofold increase in truncated APC expression was observed for SW480 cells in which miR-29a was knocked down (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, upper panel). We also measured the mRNA level of PTC-<i>APC</i> in SW480 cells and found that the knockdown of miR-29a caused a \u223c1.6-fold increase of PTC-<i>APC</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), which is consistent with the important role of translational repression by miRNAs. The successful knockdown of endogenous miR-29a expression was confirmed by Northern blotting (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, middle panel) and a reporter assay (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4B,C</a>); by contrast, the abundance of an untargeted endogenous miRNA, miR-26a, remained unchanged (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, bottom panel), suggesting the upregulation observed for PTC-<i>APC</i> was specifically induced by the inhibition of miR-29a."

The amount of WT-APC protein remained unchanged after the induction of miR-29a expression to much higher levels in the cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>) because the miR-29a miREs are located within the PTC-STOP region but not the 3\u2032 UTR of <i>APC</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

The level of endogenous PTC-<i>APC</i> mRNA associated with Ago2 showed a mild but reproducible decrease when miR-29a was knocked down (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>) and a significant increase upon miR-29a overexpression in SW480 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). The 3\u2032 UTR of <i>APC</i> mRNA contains no miR-29a miREs, which was determined by comparing the expression of a luciferase reporter bearing a full-length <i>APC</i> 3\u2032 UTR in the presence of miR-29a versus a negative control small RNA (siNC) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L</a>). Therefore, the changes in the levels of Ago2-associated PTC-<i>APC</i> mRNA in SW480 cells are most likely due to a direct effect of miR-29a targeting its miREs within the PTC-STOP region. Moreover, the binding efficiency of <i>APC</i>-PTC1450 mRNA bearing wild-type or mutant miREs to Ago2 was compared by co-transfecting HEK293 cells with the minigene construct and a miR-29a mimic or a control small RNA. In the presence of miR-29a, the <i>APC</i>-PTC1450 mRNA that harbors wild-type miR-29a miREs has a much stronger association with Ago2 than does its counterpart that contains the mutant miREs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3M</a>). In addition, a mutant version of the miR-29a mimic that restored base-pairing of the 2\u20137 seed with the mutant miR-29a miRE also restored repression of <i>APC</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), supporting the conclusion that repression of PTC-<i>APC</i> expression is achieved through the direct interaction of miR-29a with the miREs we mapped. Altogether, these observations represent novel evidence that the expression of a naturally occurring nonsense mRNA is selectively repressed by endogenous miRNAs in the cells."

We therefore sought to determine whether these EJC-NMD-competent transcripts are simultaneously subjected to miRNA-mediated surveillance. <i>BRCA1</i>, a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated in breast cancer, was chosen for further investigation. Unlike <i>APC</i>, mutations that lead to the expression of a truncated version of BRCA1 are scattered along the ORF (<a href=\"#bib3\">Castilla et al., 1994</a>); therefore, most <i>BRCA1</i> nonsense mutants contain introns downstream of the PTC and are EJC-NMD-sensitive (<a href=\"#bib32\">Perrin-Vidoz et al., 2002</a>). We amplified the cDNA of the PTC-STOP region of one clinically identified <i>BRCA1</i> mutant (with a PTC at codon 526) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Perrin-Vidoz et al., 2002</a>) and fused it to the 3\u2032 end of a firefly luciferase coding region to create a chimera such that the original stop codon of the luciferase gene serves as a PTC in the fused reporter (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This reporter (pFL-BRCA1) has no downstream introns and harbors wild-type miREs; therefore, it is expected to be sensitive to miRNA only. pFL-BRCA1in is identical to pFL-BRCA1 except that two downstream introns were incorporated to render the transcript sensitive to EJC-NMD in addition to miRNA. The expression level of pFL-BRCA1in was significantly lower compared to pFL-BRCA1, indicating that EJC-NMD was contributing to the repressive activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, left panel). When GW182, a key component of RISC, was knocked down &gt;70% by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in HeLa-tTA cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, right panel), the expression level of pFL-BRCA1 was significantly increased, which indicates that miRNAs were indeed involved in the repression. More importantly, knockdown of GW182 also caused a comparable extent of upregulation of pFL-BRCA1in, suggesting that miRNA-mediated repression of PTC-containing mRNAs is independent of the presence of downstream introns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, left panel). Thus, miRNA-mediated surveillance and EJC-NMD are not mutually exclusive, and the repressive effects caused by both mechanisms are additive."

Analysis of transcriptome data (<a href=\"#bib8\">Djebali et al., 2012</a>) indicates that 47 of them were actively expressed in HCT-116 cells (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>).

Together, our results strongly support the view that miRNA-mediated surveillance may serve as a general mechanism that downregulates various nonsense mRNAs in human cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

We have also experimentally verified that nonsense mutants of <i>APC</i>, <i>BRCA1</i>, and a few other genes are subjected to miRNA-mediated surveillance in human cells. Our findings indicate that besides their established roles in regulating gene expression, miRNAs may serve as a novel surveillance system to reduce aberrant mRNAs bearing PTCs and their potentially harmful truncated protein products, thus functioning as an important supplement to other mRNA surveillance systems in mammalian cells."

                        "text": "Unlike classic NMD, miRNA-mediated surveillance is EJC-independent and recognizes its targets only if an miRE is embedded in the PTC-STOP region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) at a position as close as 10 nt downstream of the PTC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). The repressive influence of miRNA is enhanced by combining accelerated mRNA degradation and translational inhibition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>). Furthermore, miRNA-mediated surveillance can work together with other surveillance mechanisms, such as EJC-NMD, in an additive manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>), which strengthens the repressive activity and expands the substrate spectrum of the cellular mRNA quality control system. An estimated one-third of genetic diseases are associated with truncated proteins produced from nonsense mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kuzmiak and Maquat, 2006</a>). Indeed, truncated BRCA1 has been shown to antagonize wild-type BRCA1 function in a dominant-negative manner (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fan et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sylvain et al., 2002</a>), and several lines of evidence support the view that truncated APC contributes to colorectal cancer by causing spindle misalignment that eventually leads to chromosomal instability (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fodde et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Tighe et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Quyn et al., 2010</a>). As predicted by a 2\u20137 seed match algorithm, the nonsense mutants of <i>APC</i> and <i>BRCA1</i> contain many potential conventional miREs in their PTC-STOP regions and several of them are experimentally validated in the cell lines, suggesting that these disease-causing mutants may be targets of miRNA-mediated surveillance. Recent studies have revealed that many unconventional miREs exist in animals (<a href=\"#bib38\">Shin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Helwak et al., 2013</a>), raising the possibility that many more functional miREs may be present than would be predicted by a search algorithm based on the 2\u20137 seed match rule. In addition, targets for only a limited number of miRNAs were sought, which could also lead us to underestimate the frequency with which miREs are present in the PTC-STOP regions. The abundance of some endogenous miRNAs is already very high in HEK293 cells, which could lead them to falsely be scored as negative in our mimic-based screening. Such miRNAs could be identified by performing the screening in multiple cell lines that have different miRNA profiles. Moreover, the contribution of miRNAs to the overall level of repression may be even greater if we count the inhibitory effect of miRNAs on translation, which would not be evident in the RNA sequencing data (<a href=\"#bib25\">MacArthur et al., 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "Interestingly, we found that a luciferase reporter harboring the miR-29a miREs from the PTC-STOP region of <i>APC</i> nonsense mutant is efficiently repressed only in colon-derived SW480 cells but is not in kidney-derived HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4B,D</a>), which correlates well with the relatively high abundance of miR-29a in SW480 cells and its undetectable level of expression in HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2013H</a>). This finding implies that a nonsense mRNA may have a very different fate in distinct tissues depending on which miRNAs are highly expressed. It is well established that the expression of many miRNAs are tissue- or cell type-specific and are dynamically regulated during cell differentiation or under different physiological conditions (<a href=\"#bib16a\">Houbaviy et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib24b\">Liu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24c\">Lu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26a\">Marsit et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23a\">Landgraf et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24a\">Liang et al., 2007</a>). Some nonsense mRNAs may escape miRNA-mediated surveillance due to the lack of expression of certain miRNAs in some tissues or under some stress conditions, thereby increasing the risk of tissue-specific diseases."

Transcripts with retained introns, for example, are efficiently degraded by miRNAs, as shown by our BG reporter assays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Considering that introns tend to be very long and rich in repeats, we believe many more transcripts with retained introns may be targeted by miRNAs. Consistent with this idea, more than 10% of Ago-CLIP reads map to introns (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hafner et al., 2010</a>). Our computational analyses of transcriptome and published Ago-CLIP sequencing data from two human cell lines revealed that hundreds of PTC-containing transcripts generated by intron retention are indeed bound by Ago in the PTC-STOP regions (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>), which makes them attractive candidates of miRNA-mediated surveillance."

LastEx-PTC was constructed by mutating one nucleotide at codon 121 to introduce a PTC in TBG. The LastEx-L7 and LastEx-PTC-L7 plasmids were constructed by inserting one let-7a miRE originating from human <i>LIN-28</i> (GCACAGCCTATTGAACTACCTCA) in-frame into TBG and LastEx-PTC. hp-LastEx-L7 is identical to LastEx-L7 except for the presence of a stable hairpin (GGGGCGCGTGGTGGCGGCTGCAGCCGCCACCACGCGCCCC) in the \u03b2-globin 5\u2032 UTR 29 nt upstream of the initiation codon. A Renilla luciferase ORF was fused to the 5\u2032 end of BG ORF to create a RL-BG chimeric reporter, and then the stable hairpin was placed in the 5\u2032 UTR at the same position as hp-LastEx-L7 to generate hp-RL-BG. Two nucleotides within the let-7a miRE seed region were mutated without changing the amino acids to generate LastEx-PTC-L7M and hp-LastEx-L7M. Two nucleotides of the 5\u2032 splicing site and three nucleotides of the 3\u2032 splicing site within the final intron of TBG or LastEx-L7 were mutated to create TBG-IR or TBG-IR-L7. Two nucleotides within the let-7a miRE seed region were mutated without changing the amino acids to generate TBG-IR-L7M. For the second set of TBG plasmids containing a miR-21 miRE, all the other designs are identical to the TBG plasmids with a let-7a miRE except for two differences: (1) the PTC site was introduced at codon 116, and (2) an artificial miR-21 miRE complementary to miR-21 with three centered mismatches (TCAACATCAGAGAGATAAGCTA) was inserted in-frame into TBG. The plasmid 3\u2032UTR-L7 has been described (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wu et al., 2006</a>). The let-7a miRE between the NheI and XbaI sites was replaced by a miR-21 miRE to generate 3\u2032UTR-21. PTC102, PTC102-L7, and PTC102-L7M are identical to LastEx-PTC, LastEx-PTC-L7, and LastEx-PTC-L7M, respectively, except that the PTC site was introduced at codon 102. The let-7a miRE or its mutant in PTC102-L7 or PTC102-L7M was replaced with a miR-21 miRE or its mutant to generate PTC102-21 and PTC102-21M. Two tandem miR-125b miREs (GGTATCACAAGTTACAATCTCAGGGATAGCCAAGGTATCACAAGTTACAATCTCAGGGATAGCCAATTCTTAAT) were inserted between the EcoRI and XbaI sites 59 nt downstream of the firefly luciferase ORF with modified 3\u2032 UTR sequences containing an additional stop codon to generate TAA-2E. The original stop codon of the luciferase gene was disrupted by a point mutation to obtain TCA-2E. One miR-125b miRE was inserted in-frame into a modified firefly luciferase plasmid at different positions before or after the PTC to generate a series of miRE-containing luciferase plasmids. The <i>APC</i> minigene plasmid was constructed by placing an HA-tagged <i>APC</i> ORF with or without its natural 3\u2032 UTR downstream of the CMV promoter. An HA-tagged <i>EGFP</i> ORF was driven by an SV40 promoter from the same plasmid backbone. PTCs and the corresponding miRE mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. miRE screening plasmids for <i>APC</i>, <i>BRCA1</i>, and all of the selected candidates from HCT-116 cells were constructed by fusing corresponding PTC-STOP regions to the 3\u2032 end of a firefly luciferase ORF. miRE validation plasmids were constructed either by inserting \u223c30 nt sequences that surround predicted miRE seeds into the 3\u2032 UTR of a firefly luciferase reporter gene or by fusing the whole PTC-STOP region of each candidate with the mutated miRE seed to the 3\u2032 end of the firefly luciferase ORF. The last 738 nt of <i>APC</i> coding region (PTC-STOP region) plus the entire 3\u2032 UTR were fused to the 3\u2032 end of a firefly luciferase ORF to generate pFL-APC-WT. The miR-29a miREs and miR-135b miRE were disrupted individually or together by site-directed mutagenesis to generate pFL-APC-29M, pFL-APC-135M, and pFL-APC-29M+125M. The sequence of the <i>APC</i> natural 3\u2032 UTR was cloned downstream of a firefly luciferase gene to generate pFL-APC-3\u2032UTR. Mature miR-29a or a negative control small RNA sequence siEGFP (AACTTCAGGGTCAGCTTGCCG) was cloned into the inducible TRIPZ lentiviral shRNA vector to generate miRNA-overexpression lentiviruses. A miRNA decoy sequence (TuD-NC or TuD-29a) was cloned into the GIPZ constitutive lentiviral vector to generate miRNA-knockdown lentiviruses. pFL-BRCA1 is identical to the <i>BRCA1</i> miRE screening plasmid. pFL-BRCA1in harbors two introns downstream of the luciferase stop codon. Functional miR-137 and miR-544 miREs within the <i>BRCA1</i> PTC-STOP region were subjected to a synonymous mutation to generate pFL-BRCA1-mut and pFL-BRCA1in-mut."

After blocking with 5% non-fat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) for 30 min at room temperature, the blot was probed for 1 hr at room temperature with anti-HA antibodies (1:3000; ImB, Shanghai, China), anti-APC antibodies (1:200; Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA), anti-GAPDH antibodies (1:3000; Bioworld, St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA), or anti-\u03b1-Tubulin antibodies (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) diluted in PBST buffer with 1% BSA, then incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pennsylvania, USA) in 5% non-fat milk, and detected with an Immun-Star HRP chemiluminescence kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA). For validation of GW182 knockdown in HeLa-tTA cells, an anti-GW182 antibody (1:1000; MBL, Nagoya, Japan) was used."

The exome sequencing data (24 \u00d7 coverage) for HCT-116 cells have been deposited in the Short Read Archive (SRA accession number: SRX528176). Raw exome sequencing data were mapped to the human genome (hg19) using BWA with five mismatches allowed per uniquely aligned read, and duplicate reads were marked using Picard. The alignments were then processed to generate SNV calls as a standard workflow by GATK. A human SNV dataset was downloaded from the GATK resource bundle (<a href=\"http://ftp.broadinstitute.org\">ftp.broadinstitute.org</a>). SNVs that lead to premature termination were designated as PTCs and were used in further analysis. Genes with a PTC/WT allele reads ratio between 0.7 and 1.3 were considered to be heterozygous."

Functional annotation of PTCs was performed with reference to GRCh37.70 using snpEff. For transcripts with multiple isoforms, the one with the longest PTC-STOP region was annotated for downstream analysis. PTC-containing transcripts were subdivided into EJC-NMD-sensitive and/or miRNA-mediated surveillance-sensitive groups: if a PTC site was found more than 50 nt upstream of the final exon\u2013exon junction in a transcript, it was regarded as an EJC-NMD- and miRNA-mediated surveillance-sensitive candidate; otherwise the transcript was considered a miRNA-mediated surveillance-sensitive candidate."

In contrast to NMD mediated by the exon junction complex (EJC), this process is mediated by miRNAs. Using several reporter assays, the authors show that when a premature termination codon (PTC) is present, the region of the ORF downstream becomes accessible to miRNA-mediated repression. They go on to investigate a naturally occurring example of NMD in the APC gene, and find that this is mediated by several different miRNAs that bind to the region between the PTC and the stop codon. They then use reporters based on BRCA1 to show that the effects of miRNA-mediated and EJC-mediated NMD are additive. Finally, the authors identify PTC mutations in number of genes and show miRNA-mediated NMD in a reporter construct for several of these, suggesting that this mechanism may be widespread."

Given the prevalence of potential seed matches for the numerous human miRNAs, it seems quite unlikely that there would be no targeting in these longer regions. Deadenylation in the intron-retained \u03b2-globin mRNA without the let-7 target site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) does seem to be more rapid than in the other reporters, which could be explained by endogenous miRNA targeting."

To identify at which end of \u03b2-globin (BG) mRNA the shortening occurs, the RNA samples were treated with RNase H and an oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the interior of the BG reporter mRNA (codons 74-81) to generate 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 fragments, which were then separated by electrophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and detected by Northern blotting. In addition to the Northern blot examination of the 3\u2019 cleavage products of BG mRNAs shown previously in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, we have now also included Northern blot analysis of the 5\u2019 fragments in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> (bottom portion) and demonstrated that shortening at the 5\u2019 end of BG mRNA is undetectable during the entire period, in contrast to the shortening of the 3\u2019 fragments that results from removal of the poly(A) tails. Moreover, treatment of the RNA samples with oligo(dT) and RNase H caused the BG 3\u2019 fragments that previously appeared as diffuse bands after electrophoresis to migrate uniformly to a position corresponding to fully deadenylated mRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), which constitutes additional evidence for 3\u2019 poly(A) tail shortening."

To more accurately quantify the half-life of BG mRNA (wild-type BG mRNA has an intrinsically long half-life of &gt;12 hr), we collected RNA samples at later time points than we did previously when monitoring mRNA deadenylation. The results demonstrate that, as a consequence of accelerated deadenylation, the BG mRNA bearing both the let-7a miRE and the upstream PTC decayed much faster than counterparts that lacked the PTC or the let-7a miRE or bore the mutant let-7a miRE, its half-life decreasing from &gt;6 hr to &lt;3 hr. LastEx-L7 decayed slightly faster than the control BG mRNAs (TBG and LastEx-PTC), which suggests that the miRE located in the ORF may still have residual activity. Importantly, the presence of a stable hairpin in the 5\u2019 UTR (hp-LastEx-L7) significantly increased the decay rate of LastEx-L7 mRNA, with the half-life decreasing from &gt;6 hr to &lt;3 hr. These findings are consistent with the deadenylation assays shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, which suggest that translating ribosomes may indeed have interfered with miRNA-RISC binding to the miREs located in the ORF and thus masked their repressive function. The representative results from multiple experiments are now included as <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>."

This finding is not surprising since these regions are very short (84 nt in LastEx-PTC and 138 nt inPTC102). However, retention of the last intron in TBG-IR would introduce a 570-nt PTC-STOP region that contains multiple predicted miREs (listed in the table below). Some of the predicted miREs are targets of highly expressed endogenous miRNAs in HeLa cells, such as miR-10a/b and miR-17/20a. This may explain the slightly accelerated deadenylation rate of the TBG-IR reporter, which is consistent with our model that non-functional miREs embedded in retained introns can become functional miREs in the presence of an upstream PTC."

Furthermore, other endogenous miRNAs, such as miR-21 and miR-103a-3p, have multiple predicted miREs but did not cause significant repression when corresponding mimics were transfected into the cells, possibly because they are naturally present at a high cellular concentration in the cells. This could lead to an underestimation of the actual number of miREs that are located in the PTC-STOP region.

First, we performed Ago2-RIP assays to determine the change in the abundance of endogenous PTC-<i>APC</i> mRNA associated with Ago2 in SW480 cells upon miR-29a knockdown or overexpression. The level of endogenous PTC-<i>APC</i> mRNA associated with Ago2 showed a mild but reproducible decrease when miR-29a was knocked down (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>) and a significant increase upon miR-29a overexpression in SW480 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). The 3\u2019 UTR of <i>APC</i> mRNA contains no miR-29a miREs, which was determined by comparing the expression of a luciferase reporter bearing a full length <i>APC</i> 3\u2019 UTR in the presence of miR-29a versus a negative control small RNA (siNC) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L</a>). Therefore, the changes in the Ago2-associated PTC-<i>APC</i> mRNA levels in SW480 cells are most likely due to a direct effect of miR-29a targeting its miREs within the PTC-STOP region. Moreover, we used the Ago2-RIP assay to compare the binding efficiency of <i>APC</i>-PTC1450 mRNAs bearing wild-type or mutant miREs by co-transfecting HEK293 cells with the minigene constructs and a miR-29a mimic or a control small RNA. We observed a 3-fold enrichment of the PTC-<i>APC</i> mRNA bearing wild-type miREs versus mutant miREs, and this enrichment was miR-29a-specific (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3M</a>). In addition, we synthesized a miR-29a mutant that restores complementary to the mutant miREs and found that this mutant miRNA successfully restores repression of the PTC-<i>APC</i> mRNA bearing mutant miREs (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 5</a>).

First, we constructed a pair of <i>APC</i>-PTC1450 minigene plasmids that contain the full length 3\u2019 UTR of <i>APC</i> mRNA, one with wild-type miR-29a miREs and the other with the mutant miREs.

In addition, to examine the relationship between unmasked ORF miREs and existing 3\u2019 UTR miREs more quantitatively, we designed chimeric reporters in which the PTC-STOP region and the entire 3\u2019 UTR of <i>APC</i> mRNA were fused to the 3\u2019 end of a firefly luciferase ORF. The miR-29a miREs in the PTC-STOP region and a miR-135b miRE in the <i>APC</i> 3\u2019 UTR previously reported to be functional (Nagel et al., <i>Cancer Res</i>, 2008) were mutated either individually or simultaneously. In the presence of both miRNAs, the wild-type chimeric reporter was repressed efficiently, while mutating either the ORF miRE or the 3\u2019 UTR miRE alleviated the repression (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 3</a>). These observations support the conclusion that ORF miREs unmasked by an upstream PTC are fully functional even when miREs in the 3\u2019 UTR are also targeted by miRNAs."
