In eukaryotes, the SRP Alu domain arrests translation elongation of membrane proteins until targeting is complete. Curiously, however, the Alu domain is lacking in most eubacteria. In this study, by analyzing genome-wide data on translation rates, we identified a potential compensatory mechanism in <i>E. coli</i> that serves to slow down the translation during membrane protein targeting. The underlying mechanism is likely programmed into the coding sequence, where Shine\u2013Dalgarno-like elements trigger elongation pauses at strategic positions during the early stages of translation. We provide experimental evidence that slow translation during targeting and improves membrane protein production fidelity, as it correlates with better folding of overexpressed membrane proteins. Thus, slow elongation is important for membrane protein targeting in <i>E. coli</i>, which utilizes mechanisms different from the eukaryotic one to control the translation speed."

In eukaryotes, the SRP Alu domain arrests translation elongation of membrane proteins until targeting is complete. Curiously, however, the Alu domain is lacking in most eubacteria. In this study, by analyzing genome-wide data on translation rates, we identified a potential compensatory mechanism in <i>E. coli</i> that serves to slow down the translation during membrane protein targeting. The underlying mechanism is likely programmed into the coding sequence, where Shine\u2013Dalgarno-like elements trigger elongation pauses at strategic positions during the early stages of translation. We provide experimental evidence that slow translation during targeting and improves membrane protein production fidelity, as it correlates with better folding of overexpressed membrane proteins. Thus, slow elongation is important for membrane protein targeting in <i>E. coli</i>, which utilizes mechanisms different from the eukaryotic one to control the translation speed."

Some proteins have to be inserted into the membranes of cells and these proteins are directed, as they are being built, to the membrane by another molecular complex called the signal recognition particle (or SRP for short). The SRP binds to the new protein as it emerges from the ribosome and helps to direct it to the membrane. To make sure that membrane proteins fold correctly, their translation is paused whilst the protein is being targeted to the membrane. Plants, animals, and other eukaryotes do this via a unique part of the SRP complex that only allows the translation to continue once the translating ribosome has been brought close to the membrane. However, most bacteria lack this part of the SRP complex, and yet they are still able to accurately insert new, correctly folded, proteins into their membranes. This suggests that an alternative mechanism must exist in bacterial cells."

Membrane proteins are extremely hydrophobic and aggregation-prone and are therefore inserted into the membrane co-translationally (<a href=\"#bib47\">White and von Heijne, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Luirink et al., 2012</a>). To do so, they must be targeted to the translocon early in translation before large polypeptide portions are synthesized (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lakkaraju et al., 2008</a>). Targeting of ribosomes translating membrane proteins is mediated by the ubiquitous signal recognition particle (SRP) system (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bibi, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akopian et al., 2013</a>). The core machinery is conserved in all organisms and is comprised of the ribonuceoprotein complex SRP and its receptor. The pathway works such that the SRP binds to the first transmembrane segment (TM) that emerges from the ribosome and directs it together with the translocon-associated SRP receptor to the translocon. In eukaryotes, the SRP arrests the elongation upon binding to ribosome-nascent chain complexes, in order to prevent the protein synthesis before targeting is complete (<a href=\"#bib46\">Walter and Blobel, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mason et al., 2000</a>). The arrest is mediated through the SRP Alu domain that binds to the elongation factor binding site (<a href=\"#bib10\">Halic et al., 2004</a>) and is kept until the ribosome arrives at the translocon, causing the SRP dissociation. Puzzlingly, however, the bacterial world displays a dichotomy in the structure of the SRP, wherein Gram-positive bacteria typically possess an Alu domain and Gram-negatives, such as <i>E. coli</i>, are typically devoid of it (<a href=\"#bib36\">Regalia et al., 2002</a>)<i>.</i> Accordingly, in vitro translation studies suggested that the <i>Escherichia coli</i> SRP cannot arrest translation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Raine et al., 2003</a>). Thus, other mechanisms that compensate for the lack of Alu-mediated arrest in Gram-negative bacteria could be required, especially considering their faster translation rates compared to eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Young and Bremer, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bonven and Gull\u00f8v, 1979</a>). One such putative mechanism has recently been described (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yosef et al., 2010</a>), which calls for further investigation."

In that study, <a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al. (2012)</a> found that ribosome pause sites are often explained by a Shine\u2013Dalgarno (SD)-like sequence located 8\u201311 nucleotides upstream of the currently decoded codon. In order to understand the potential function of pauses better, we sought to investigate where such mRNA-programmed pauses are preferentially located. To identify pause sites, we searched for codons exhibiting high <i>local</i> ribosome density compared to other codons in the same coding sequence. Ribosome density profiles for well-expressed genes (i.e., with reliable ribosome profiling data, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) were calculated by normalizing the ribosome density in codons to the median density of the gene (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Unless otherwise noted, all analyses were based on these normalized profiles. Assuming that ribosomes flow along mRNAs is in steady-state, ribosome density in these profiles is inversely proportional to translation speed (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tuller et al., 2010</a>). The first and last four codons were excluded since they contain high density related to an initiation \u2018ramp\u2019 and translation termination, respectively (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tuller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Oh et al., 2011</a>). We considered \u2018pause codons\u2019 as those that constitute the 5% of the most dense codons genome-wide, corresponding to \u223csixfold higher density than the median density of genes in which they reside (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To generate a dependable SD-mediated set of pause sites, we filtered out pause codons for which we could not identify an upstream SD-like element (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Codons that passed both filters (high local density and SD-like element) constitute \u223c2.5% of all codons and we refer to them as \u2018programmed pauses\u2019."

The ribosome density profiles of all coding sequences were aligned at their start codon, and the fraction of programmed pause codons in each position was analyzed. The results show that membrane proteins are enriched with pauses between codons 16 and 60, after which they level-down to values similar to cytosolic proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Pauses occur in roughly 4% of the proteins at each codon position in membrane proteins within the codon range 16\u201360 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Indeed, over the entire range of codons from position 16 to 60, we find that 69% of membrane proteins have at least one programmed pause position, significantly higher compared to cytosolic (50%, p = 1.5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22127</sup>) and periplasmic proteins (41%, p = 6 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>, <i>Z</i>-test for 2 proportions) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, inset). The occurrence of pauses in this codon range indicates that pauses are specifically enriched in membrane proteins only in the early stages of translation elongation, in a coding sequence region which coincides with the stage of membrane protein targeting. Two distinct peaks of elevated pauses were observed, the first in codons 16\u201336 and the second in codons 40\u201360 (defined here as \u2018region I\u2019 and \u2018region II\u2019, respectively, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

We noticed that region II coincides with the location of the beginning of the second transmembrane segment (TM2) in many membrane proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To test a potential link, we aligned all membrane proteins according to their TM2 start (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and calculated the frequency of pauses along the aligned coding sequences at various distances from that point. Indeed, we found a peak of high pause frequency just before the start of TM2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) (p = 3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22126</sup>, 2-sample <i>t</i> test), extending from five codons before TM2 to the second codon of the TM. This observation suggests that membrane protein translation is programmed to pause just before TM2 residues are added to the elongating nascent chain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Curiously, the peak is much sharper when considering only proteins with intracellular N-termini (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) (p = 4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22129</sup>, 2-sample <i>t</i> test), in which TM2 occurs in \u2018Type-I topology\u2019 (the N-terminus of TM2 is extracellular), suggesting that proteins with extracellular N-termini do not pause before TM2. To explore the difference between the two groups, we analyzed amino acid biases before TM2 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The main difference was excess of arginines and lysines before the TM in proteins with extracellular N-termini, in accordance with the \u2018positive inside rule\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib42\">von Heijne, 2006</a>). This difference is predicted to increase pauses in this location (<a href=\"#bib5\">Charneski and Hurst, 2013</a>), unlike the actually observed decreased pauses in this group of proteins. Thus, differences in amino-acid sequences cannot account for the difference in the pausing behavior. We attempted to explore if proteins with extracellular N-termini may instead have pauses at other locations, however, analyses of these proteins were precluded by low statistical power due to small sample size (only 88 proteins in our data set are predicted to have extracellular N-termini, as opposed to 237 with intracellular N-termini). Therefore, with the current limitations, we cannot conclude if these proteins may have pauses elsewhere or if they do not utilize the pause strategy altogether. We therefore excluded these proteins, which constitute a minority of the membrane proteome, from further analysis in sections that deal with pauses in region II."

Given that the exit tunnel of the ribosome admits \u223c28 amino acids of the extended polypeptide (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bornemann et al., 2008</a>), pausing of the ribosome at these positions means that in most proteins the first TM has partially emerged out of the ribosome during pausing. The pause location is reminiscent of the location at which the translation arrest occurs in the eukaryotic case, when the SRP arrests translation after TM1 was synthesized and exposed out of the ribosome. This suggests a common physiological role of slowing elongation during targeting. Interestingly, only \u223c25% of membrane proteins (59 out of 237) have identifiable pauses at codons \u22125 to +1 relative to TM2 start, and indeed only these proteins display high local ribosome density in this region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The quantitative difference in density between proteins with and without pause in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> suggests that the pause duration is approximately 1.5 s (roughly the time it takes to translate 28 codons, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). To check the dependence of translation rate on SD-like elements, we repeated the density analysis of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> with a modified data set in which all nucleotide positions with even weak upstream SD-like motif were excluded from the analysis (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The results show that upon SD exclusion, the slow-down in this region was nearly abolished (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) suggesting that the SD motif is necessary to generate the observed pauses. It is important to note that several important pauses probably escaped our detection. First, the pauses may occur at subtly different locations from codon \u22125 to +1 relative to TM2 and our thresholds for pause consideration might be too stringent. Secondly, the TMs and their boundaries are not accurately predicted by the existing methods (in about 25% of proteins, we found disagreements of at least 10 residues in the location of TM2 between two databases, Uniprot and ExTopoDB). Nevertheless, it seems that SD-programmed pauses before TM2 occur only in a subset of the membrane proteome and are not crucial for the production of all membrane proteins."

This is consistent with a role of the pauses in promoting the production fidelity, since highly expressed proteins and their mRNAs require more tight quality control and are hence better adapted for fidelity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Drummond and Wilke, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tuller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Levy et al., 2012</a>).

We hypothesized that the role of the pause before TM2 is to delay the synthesis of TM2 after TM1 was synthesized, in order to complete membrane-targeting before synthesis of additional hydrophobic protein segments. If this is correct, then a long loop between these TMs whose translation requires more time could be just as beneficial. Indeed, our analysis revealed that first loops (i.e., those between TM1 and TM2) are enriched for long lengths of \u226560 residues and depleted of short lengths of \u226410 residues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (p = 6 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221210</sup> and p = 3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup> respectively, hypergeometric test). Consecutive loops locations between the other TMs showed no significant enrichment for longer loop (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Although there could be alternative explanations for why membrane proteins evolved to have larger first loops, such loops can certainly delay the translation of TM2 after TM1 was synthesized. Indeed, we found that proteins having long first loops (\u226560 residues, 34 proteins) almost never had pauses before TM2 compared to proteins with shorter loops (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) (p = 0.01, hypergeometric test).

In this state, the SRP cannot directly interact with the nascent peptide. However, recent studies showed that <i>E. coli</i>'s SRP can efficiently target such ribosome-nascent-chain complexes to the membrane (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bornemann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Holtkamp et al., 2012</a>) and that this is done regardless of the class of translated proteins (cytosolic/membrane/periplasmic). Thus, increased pausing at this codon range may perhaps give membrane proteins an advantage over cytosolic proteins in being targeted even before direct SRP\u2013nascent peptide interaction is possible."

A previous study showed that once a sufficiently long peptide emerges, targeting by the <i>E. coli</i> SRP becomes substrate-specific; namely, if the exposed peptide contains a hydrophobic transmembrane segment, then SRP will remain bound to the ribosome-nascent-chain complex and direct its targeting. Otherwise, hydrophilic peptides cause SRP-dissociation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bornemann et al., 2008</a>). We therefore reasoned that membrane proteins having long hydrophilic N-terminal tails before TM1 may constitute a unique case and may not benefit from such pauses, since the emerging hydrophilic peptide would cause SRP-dissociation and productive targeting would occur only later, when the first TM emerges. Indeed, unlike other membrane proteins, proteins with at least 80 residues before TM1 (n = 16) did not show an elevated pause frequency at codons 16\u201336 (p = 0.01, <i>Z</i>-test for two proportions), nor did they show elevated ribosome density (p = 0.013, one-tailed two-sample <i>t</i> test) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,D</a>). Thus, although further studies are necessary, our results suggest that pauses that occur when the peptide is still unexposed may aid in the targeting of membrane proteins without long hydrophilic N-terminal tails."

A role in promoting production fidelity is suggested by the function of translation arrest in eukaryotes. In order to test this hypothesis directly, we chose a set of 100 membrane proteins to overexpress in <i>E coli.</i> Based on the results above, proteins having long polypeptide stretches (&gt;50 residues) before the first TM or between TM1 and TM2 were excluded from the expression set. Overexpressed proteins were hybrids with a C-terminal GFP-His<sub>8</sub>, which enabled the separate detection of both the unfolded and folded protein levels, as shown for several membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib44\">Waldo et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Geertsma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Linares et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">M\u00fcller-Lucks et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Schlegel et al., 2012</a>). The discrimination is possible because unfolding or aggregation of fused proteins hinders GFP-folding and -fluorescence, whereas folded and fluorescent GFP is indicative of the functional and folded fused protein (<a href=\"#bib8\">Geertsma et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Linares et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">M\u00fcller-Lucks et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Schlegel et al., 2012</a>). The resistance of folded GFP to SDS-denaturation allows the resolution of both GFP forms by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, since folded GFP migrates faster (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To confirm the method, we assessed the detergent-solubility of five different overexpressed membrane proteins. The results of fractionation studies showed that only the folded GFP-coupled forms were soluble with mild detergent, while the unfolded forms were insoluble and probably aggregated (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Our set of 87 tested proteins covers a wide range of translation speeds at regions I and II, that is, at codons 16\u201336 and before TM2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We divided the set to three quantiles according to translation speed: from the 33% of genes having the fastest translation speed (lowest ribosome density) to those having the slowest speed (high density) in these codon ranges (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, colors). Remarkably, genes with slower translation at these codons showed a 95% elevation in expression of the folded protein form, compared with genes having fast translation (p = 3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, two-sample <i>t</i> test) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This difference was not observed for expression of the unfolded/aggregated form of the proteins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), suggesting that translation speed during targeting specifically influences the extent of correct folding rather than affecting the overall expression level."

This indicates that regardless of the identity of the overexpressed protein, the cell's capacity to produce high amounts of folded membrane proteins is limited, and increased expression levels would result in increased aggregation. We propose that this dependency reflects saturation of the membrane protein biogenesis machineries in the cell, which becomes less efficient upon high membrane protein overexpression. This finding is in agreement with previous indications that membrane proteins are often better expressed in functional form under lower induction regimes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wagner et al., 2008</a>)."

Proteins that are translated fast saturated at relatively low amounts of folded protein (apart from a single protein), while slowly translated proteins converged to higher saturation levels, if they saturated at all (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). This effect is contributed by translation slowing at both codons 16 to 36 and at codons before TM2 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The trend is also reflected by the difference between the groups in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and suggests that slow translation during targeting supports less aggregation of the overexpressed proteins. Notably, slow translation at other more downstream codon locations may also be beneficial for folding (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). However, slow translation is much more common at codons 16\u201360, that is at the codon region that covers regions I and II, than downstream (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), suggesting that slowing during targeting is of particular importance."

In our limited set of genes, we found that engineering SD-like motifs in genes that are translated fast would be easier than tampering with existing SDs in slow genes. Three genes that are translated fast in our codon range of interest were selected, and 12 or 14 mutations were designed for each gene in order to maximize the affinity of the mRNA for the ribosomal anti-SD, while maintaining the amino-acid sequence unaltered (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The silent mutations enabled robust increases of anti-SD binding affinity in only two genes, ygdD and brnQ, while for the third gene, ybjJ, it only permitted a moderate increase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In order to test the effect of the mutations on protein folding, we implemented the GFP-folding assay. Indeed, upon overexpressing the wild-type and mutant genes, we observed that the two mutants with robust increase in SD motifs folded better (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>, YgdD and BrnQ), whereas the third gene showed no difference (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>, YbjJ).

To test the notion of compensation more directly, we turned to analyze the data on <i>B. subtilis</i>, an organism that can potentially utilize both mechanisms. SD-like elements were shown to control translation pauses in <i>B. subtilis</i>, like in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, although SRP-mediated arrest was never demonstrated in <i>B. subtilis</i>, unlike <i>E. coli</i>, this organism may have all components required for SRP-mediated arrest: the Alu domain of SRP RNA is present and this domain binds a protein (HBsu) that may function analogously to the eukaryotic SRP14 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nakamura et al., 1999</a>)."

We suspected that the Alu domain-mediated arrest is functional in <i>B. subtilis</i>, and therefore the pauses are expected to occur upon direct interaction of SRP with the first TM, when the TM emerges out of the ribosome exit tunnel. To examine this, we aligned the coding sequences of <i>B. subtilis</i> membrane proteins to the positions of the first residues of TM1 and the average pause profile was analyzed. This analysis showed a high elevation of pause events that occurred roughly in 45\u201365 codons after synthesis of the first residue of TM1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). Notable, albeit lower, pause peaks were also observed when aligning the coding sequences to TM2 and TM3 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). However, considering that the distance between TM1 and TM2 or TM3 is not very variable (median distances 35 and 72, respectively), these peaks most likely reflect shifted and skewed representations of the peak downstream to TM1."

If this pause is indeed mediated by the Alu domain, then it should operate regardless of SD-like elements. To test SD-independent pauses, we excluded all positions in the sequence that have even weak upstream SD-like elements (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Using this SD-depleted data set, we then checked how the translation rate (as judged by the local ribosome density) is affected by the position relative to TM1. The results show that ribosome density 45\u201365 codons downstream to TM1 was significantly elevated compared to other positions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), suggesting that <i>B. subtilis</i> utilizes a pause strategy that is independent of the SD-like sequences, possibly involving the SRP Alu domain. This trend was not observed in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), suggesting that in the absence of SD-like sequences, the ability of the <i>E. coli</i> SRP to arrest elongation is low, if any. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>B. subtilis</i> employs the eukaryotic-like strategy for slowing the elongation of translated membrane proteins, and consequently does not utilize SD-mediated pauses to this end."

The ubiquitous SRP system is responsible for the timely delivery of ribosomes translating membrane proteins to membrane translocons. The conservation of the Alu domain in both eukaryotes and Gram-positive bacteria suggests that slow elongation during targeting is universally important (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mason et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lakkaraju et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, the lack of this domain in Gram-negative bacteria, such as <i>E. coli</i>, was puzzling since it was not clear if and how such organisms can slow the elongation during targeting. In principle, the control of ribosome speed could be encoded in <i>cis</i> in the translated mRNA, or in <i>trans</i>, for example as in the case of the SRP Alu domain. Recent in vivo studies indicated that the <i>E. coli</i> SRP can inhibit membrane protein translation, but the precise underlying mechanism and the potential for influencing elongation rate are not yet clear (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yosef et al., 2010</a>). Our analyses of in vivo translation rates in <i>E. coli</i> and <i>B. subtilis</i> support the notion that strong SRP-mediated arrest that is SD-independent requires the Alu domain and is therefore probably missing in Gram-negative bacteria. Remarkably, our results suggest that <i>E. coli</i> depends, at least in part, on a <i>cis</i>-encoded means to attenuate translation during targeting, presumably due to the lack of the Alu domain. Other bacteria probably also need to compensate for the lack of Alu domain-mediated translation arrest, and the utilization of SD-mediated pauses might be a general solution."

Both mechanisms act to slow elongation in the early stages of translation, in order to facilitate membrane protein-folding and avoid aggregation. However, there are also notable differences. First, the position of the pauses in <i>E. coli</i> is different from the position of Alu domain-mediated arrest, with the former occurring earlier in translation. The reason for this is currently unclear, but it might be related to the potential for earlier targeting of ribosomes in <i>E. coli</i>, even before the nascent peptide emerges from the ribosome exit tunnel (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bornemann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Holtkamp et al., 2012</a>). Secondly, while the prokaryotic pausing relies on information embedded in the mRNA, the eukaryotic counterpart reads the protein. Lastly, there is a principal strategic difference between the two mechanisms. The SRP-mediated arrest is only relieved after proper targeting and SRP-dissociation, thus ensuring the fidelity of the process (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akopian et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, at present it is reasonable to guess that the mRNA-programmed mechanism probably pauses for a fixed amount of time, without any feedback about the targeting status. In that respect, the SRP-mediated mechanism appears to be more efficient and elegant. Notably, however, it remains to be studied whether SD-mediated pauses may also be influenced by external factors that may report on the translocon arrival, as shown for translation arrest-peptides (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ismail et al., 2012</a>). An attractive possibility is that SD-mediated pauses may somehow cooperate with the bacterial SRP and utilize the feedback provided by SRP-dissociation upon completion of targeting. Such a mechanism may also explain how the <i>E. coli</i> SRP regulates translation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yosef et al., 2010</a>)."

In eukaryotes, the arrest function can be abolished by mutation without severely compromising viability (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mason et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lakkaraju et al., 2008</a>). Similarly, in <i>E. coli</i> we observe a notable variability in the rate of translation between different membrane proteins. Our results indicate that slow translation is important especially at elevated protein amounts, when the cell's membrane protein biogenesis capacity might approach saturation. This observation agrees well with recent results in mammalian cells showing that slow translation helps in overcoming rate limitations that arise due to low concentrations of the SRP receptor. It therefore seems that both eukaryotes and prokaryotes possess limiting amounts of membrane protein biogenesis machineries, which may frequently be saturated, creating rate-limiting bottlenecks. These saturation problems are alleviated by slowing down the translation in strategic locations, which allows more time for targeting to complete before further polypeptide synthesis. In a broader perspective, translation pauses are a general strategy that is employed when a process that requires only a portion of the polypeptide is hindered by additional polypeptide segments. Two such processes are the co-translational targeting and the folding of individual domains in the multidomain proteins (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pechmann et al., 2013</a>). The time separation provided by the pause allows the completion of these processes without interruption, thus helping to avoid problems in protein folding and aggregation."

Heterologous expression of eukaryotic membrane proteins in <i>E. coli</i> is notoriously difficult, often leading to poor expression of functional proteins, creating a serious bottleneck in the field (<a href=\"#bib9\">Granseth et al., 2009</a>). Our study adds to recent studies revealing the existence of sequence preferences within coding sequences of membrane proteins in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Prilusky and Bibi, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">N\u00f8rholm et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">2013</a>), which may need to be obeyed by heterologous coding sequences. For example, SD-mediated pauses are probably lacking a priori in heterologous coding sequences. It therefore seems that in that respect, Gram-positive bacteria such as <i>B. subtilis</i> might be more compatible with eukaryotic membrane protein heterologous expression (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kunji et al., 2005</a>), since they contain a translation arrest logic similar to the eukaryotic one."

(2012)</a>.Only genes with sufficiently high ribosome density reads were analyzed (median density of reads across the coding sequence &gt;0.2). For each gene, the ribosome density in every nucleotide was divided by the median ribosome density across the coding sequence. Codon-wise density was calculated by averaging the nucleotide density in every three nucleotides of each codon. These densities indicate ribosome occupancy when the respective codons are located in the A-site of the ribosome. The first and last four codons were excluded from further analysis since they contain high densities associated with the slow translation initiation and termination. The threshold for pause codon consideration (top 5% of codon-wise density) was calculated by collecting codon density from the entire genome (for <i>E. coli</i> and <i>B. subtilis</i>, the thresholds were 6.06 and 23.4-fold higher than the median, respectively). Programmed pauses in <i>E. coli</i> were defined as codons having density above these thresholds and also having at least one SD-like element 8\u201311 nucleotides upstream of at least one of the codon nucleotides. Shine\u2013Dalgarno-like elements were identified based on the calculated binding energy of 10 nucleotide-long sequences to the ribosomal anti-SD, as described (<a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2012</a>). All positions having calculated binding energy of \u0394G &lt; \u22123.1 kcal/mol, which constitute the lowest 5% (genome-wide), were considered as SD-like elements. We note that these thresholds represent a compromise since even higher \u0394G values may affect the ribosome density, and in addition many places with lower binding energies show no indication of pause (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

Each growth experiment included two independently grown cultures harboring the emrD gene as internal standards. Sonicated cells (0.2 ml) overexpressing membrane proteins were mixed with 0.05 ml 5\u00d7 SDS sample buffer and loaded to 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Each gel included the two emrD standard clones. The gels' proteins were detected for in-gel fluorescence and Western blotting (see above). Densitometric quantifications were carried using ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare, Tel-Aviv, Israel). First, the amount of the folded protein was extracted from fluorescence measurements and normalized to that of the folded EmrD (the amount of folded EmrD protein was defined as 1 arbitrary unit). The fraction of folded and aggregated protein for each clone was calculated based on quantification of Western blots. The amounts of aggregated and total protein were calculated by combining the knowledge on amount of the folded protein (from fluorescence) with the fraction of the folded protein (from Western blotting). Quantification values are reported in the <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>."

This is an interesting and long-standing question, since the <i>E. coli</i> SRP lacks the Alu domain and it is thus unclear whether SRP can influence the elongation rates of membrane proteins. In a recent study, Yosef and co-authors (MBio, 2010) showed that overexpression of the M-domain of Ffh selectively affected translation of membrane proteins suggesting that Ffh might be responsible for arresting elongation in bacteria. In the present study Fluman and co-authors propose another mechanism of translational pausing based on the analysis of ribosome profiling data obtained by Li et al. (Nature, 2012). The authors suggest that in <i>E. coli</i> elongation pausing during membrane protein synthesis is programmed in the mRNA and mediated by the presence of <i>Shine-Dalgarno</i>-like (SD-like) sequences upstream of the TM2 coding region. Pausing at this position would allow concomitant binding of <i>E. coli</i> SRP to TM1. This mechanism applies to 25% of the membrane protein encoding mRNAs whereas synthesis of the remaining membrane proteins would be regulated by other mechanisms such as long internal loop sequences between TM1 and TM2."

For example, glycine-rich regions tend to have more <i>Shine-Dalgarno</i>-like sites (G-rich nucleotide sequences) and to be found in between transmembrane domains (flexible loops). Additionally, among the synonymous codons for the same amino acid, <i>Shine-Dalgarno</i>-like codons tend to be rare codons. Together with the propensity to have rare codons towards the N-terminus of proteins, this might explain the increased number of pauses at the 5' end and the fact that there is diminished pausing at the second transmembrane domain when the second transmembrane domain is farther from the N-terminus (and therefore longer loops in between 1st and 2nd TM). To make a compelling case that evolution selects specifically for SD-like sites to facilitate membrane targeting, the authors need to establish that the enhanced pausing is not simply a by-product of the biases in amino acid or codon choices in this region."

Additionally, the rare codons bias shows no difference between membrane and cytosolic proteins (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2C</a>), indicating that it cannot explain the difference between these protein groups. Our results indicate that there is no specific bias for Gly residues in the region where we see abundant pauses in membrane proteins (codons 16-60, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2D</a>) and here again, there is virtually no difference between membrane and cytosolic proteins.

Moreover, we now show that in 60% of the cases, SD-like elements that mediate the pauses are placed such that the sequence does not necessarily encode Gly residues because it is present also out of the reading frame, supporting direct selection for the nucleotide motif rather than for particular amino acids (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2E</a>).

These biases are most likely due to the presence of signal peptides in this location. Specifically, the depletion of pauses could arise as a by-product of depletion of Gly residues.
