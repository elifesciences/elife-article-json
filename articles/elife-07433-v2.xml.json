By producing oxygen and assimilating carbon dioxide into organic matter, this process determines, to a large extent, the composition of our atmosphere and provides essential food and fuel. Light photons are captured by pigments in very large membrane\u2013bound complexes and the excitation energy is utilized to form NADPH and ATP. Two reaction centers, photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI), drive this electron transport chain. PSII oxidizes water to produce oxygen and reduce membrane-embedded quinones. The reduced quinones are then utilized by the cytochrome b<sub>6</sub>f complex to produce a proton gradient across the membrane and to reduce the small copper protein plastocyanin (PC), the electron donor of PSI. After an additional photon is absorbed by any of the 200 antenna pigments of PSI, its energy migrates through this large network of connected pigments and eventually oxidizes P700, a special chlorophyll pair located at the center of PSI. The electron removed from P700 by this oxidation event migrates along an internal electron transport chain and finally reduces ferredoxin (Fd), the final electron acceptor of PSI. Reduced Fd is utilized by several cellular pathways, mainly the reduction of NADP to NADPH. This NADPH and ATP generated by the thylakoid ATP-synthase complex powers the Calvin cycle to produce carbohydrates."

Later, approximately 1.5 billion years ago, the first photosynthetic eukaryotes appeared, eventually evolving into land plants roughly 0.5 billion years ago. The basic building blocks of photosynthesis are remarkably conserved. The architectures of both photosystems have been determined by numerous techniques, but X-ray crystallography has provided the most detailed structural information for the four large membrane complexes catalyzing oxygenic photosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nelson and Ben-Shem, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nelson and Yocum, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Croce and van Amerongen, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nelson and Junge, 2015</a>).

This PSI preparation was limited to pea plants from the variety Alaska, and good crystals were hard to come by (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amunts et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2010</a>). Therefore, we screened for new robust crystals that are abundant, stable, and much more uniform. The new crystals could be obtained from several pea plants varieties, a large proportion of them diffracted to 3 \u00c5 with several yielding higher resolutions. In contrast to the P2<sub>1</sub> symmetry of the previous crystal, the current crystal belonged to higher symmetry space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>. The organization of the PSI unit within the new crystal was also markedly different. In the P2<sub>1</sub> crystal the PSI-LHCI complex was organized as parallel layers in which the iron-sulfur clusters F<sub>X</sub>, F<sub>A</sub> and F<sub>B</sub> face the adjacent P700 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The complexes inside the new crystal lattice were serially arranged in a crissed-crossed manner in which the polarity of each PSI unit contrasts another (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Consequently, the current crystals generated no net voltage (data not shown), whereas a voltage of up to 50 V was recorded (<a href=\"#bib54\">Toporik et al., 2012</a>) upon illumination of dried P2<sub>1</sub> crystals placed on electron conductive material."

Instead, the evolution of PSI is marked by the loss and gain of whole subunits from the complex (<a href=\"#bib50\">Scheller et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nelson, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nelson and Junge, 2015</a>). Compared to our previous model (PDB 2WSC), the root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) between the plant and cyanobacterial core (PDB 1JB0) decreased from 1.1 \u00c5 to 0.55 \u00c5. The majority of the changes made in the core subunits involved the configuration of extramembrane loops, which now closely resemble the cyanobacterial configuration. The exceptions to this role are found at the anchor points of LHCI to the core (discussed below) and at the interfaces between plant-specific subunits, such as the PsaH\u2013PsaL interaction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The dramatic change from trimer to monomeric organization that occurred in eukaryotes, was triggered by the addition of the PsaH subunit (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ben-Shem et al., 2003</a>). A new configuration for PsaH shows that this subunit binds four other core subunits. Starting from the stromal side of the membrane, the N-terminus is tightly tucked between the N-terminus of PsaD and a eukaryotic-specific loop in the PsaL subunit. PsaH then enters the membrane surrounding PsaL to prevent PSI trimerization and associates with PsaI and PsaB via mostly hydrophobic interactions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

A new chlorophyll bound by PsaH was identified at the current resolution.

Additional pigments bound by PsaA in close proximity to subunit PsaK (the structure of which is now almost completely defined) provided the first accurate description of this binding site and suggest a mechanism for energy transfer into the core antenna through the PsaK side (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Remarkably, the core pigment organization is conserved across kingdoms despite this diversity in connected antenna (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amunts et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Busch and Hippler, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Croce and van Amerongen, 2013</a>), which suggests that the connection points between the core and the antennae are conserved. The existence of red-absorbing pigments (or \u2018red traps\u2019) is a general property of PSI (<a href=\"#bib38\">Morosinotto et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wientjes et al., 2012</a>). These pigments affect the rate of trapping in PSI and can affect the path of excitation migration in the complex. Most of the eukaryotic red pigments have been shown to reside at LHCI. However, red pigments may be lost from the core complex during the isolation of LHCI. The first high-resolution PSI structure from thermophilic cyanobacteria revealed the organization of the core antenna (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jordan et al., 2001</a>). A stacked chlorophyll trimer supported by an extended loop in PsaB was the best candidate for one of the strong red absorbers in this complex (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jordan et al., 2001</a>). PsaB sequences from eukaryotes and many cyanobacteria lack this extended loop, resulting in this chlorophyll trimer being lost, as has been shown in the plant and mesophilic PSI structures (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amunts et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mazor et al., 2014</a>). At the current resolution, we observed new core chlorophyll bound between PsaG and Lhca1 and a newly discovered lipid (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This new chlorophyll restores the stacked chlorophyll trimer independent of the shortened PsaB loop and is responsible for one of the connection points between the core complex and the LHCI antenna, with a Mg\u2013Mg distance of 12.5 \u00c5 between it and chlorophyll 1010 in Lhca1 (the nomenclature for LHCII is used to describe Lhcas [<a href=\"#bib52\">Standfuss et al., 2005</a>]). On the stromal side of the membrane, an additional chlorophyll trimer first discovered in <i>Synechocystis</i> is also responsible for an antenna attachment point with a Mg\u2013Mg distance of 13.7 \u00c5 between the core chlorophyll A40 and chlorophyll 1005 in Lhca1 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We suggest that chlorophyll trimers located at the periphery of the core antenna are extremely important for antenna attachment and are probably general attachment points to the core that are utilized not only by eukaryotes, but also by other antenna systems in cyanobacteria."

Lhca1 is the main connector for excitation transfer, harboring three chlorophylls that are within 14 \u00c5 of reaction center pigments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This close proximity ensures efficient and fast energy transfer. Surprisingly, Lhca3 is also one of the main connection points with two such pairs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The final excitonic connection between PSI to LHCI is located between chlorophyll J1302 bound by PsaJ and chlorophyll 2010 (A chlorophyll b molecule). The Mg\u2013Mg distance of this pair is quite large (17.6 \u00c5) however, since the gap between LHCI and PSI allows for some movement, this distance can change to provide an efficient link between the core and LHCI (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). To summarize, the extremely fast and efficient energy transfer processes that typify PSI-LHCI occurs through only six pairs of pigment molecules located at three sites. These sites connect to the core antennae at the PsaG and PsaK poles through Lhca1 and Lhca3, with Lhca2 playing a relatively minor role."

On the stromal face of the membrane, the four conserved N-terminal domains connect each Lhca subunit to its neighbor through interaction with an Lhca-specific loop (loop 23) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) that follows immediately after the second transmembrane helix and supports a new chlorophyll site (numbered 16) in Lhca4 and Lhca2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Lhca1, which interacts with PsaG in the core complex, completely lacks this loop and instead contains a short, positively charged linker in this region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). One of the major changes in the structure of LHCI is the reversal in the polarity of PsaG. While PsaG occupies roughly an equivalent position compared to previous PSI-LHCI structures, the first transmembrane helix contacts Lhca1 while the second one contacts PsaB (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Connections between each Lhca and the core are mediated by small regions immediately preceding the first transmembrane helix and are stabilized by salt bridges between negatively charged residues positioned at the membrane entrance point and a conserved arginine located at a helix turn below them (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Additional Lhca\u2013Lhca interactions are provided by a short C-terminal segment on the luminal side that binds helix 2 as it exits the membrane, mainly via hydrophobic interactions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

This binding site should be shared between Lhca4 and Lhca5 and indeed, arginine 209 of PsaF and glutamate 84 of Lhca4 form electrostatic interactions in the middle of the hydrophobic binding site (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Four binding sites for chlorophyll b were detected in the high resolution structure of LHCII (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Standfuss et al., 2005</a>) as well as in the structure of CP29 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pan et al., 2011</a>). We were able to assign nine chlorophyll b sites in LHCI based on electron density maps (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). All Lhca proteins contain a glutamine to glutamate change (similarly to CP29) in equivalent positions to position 131 of LHCII, this change makes the binding of Chlorophyll b less likely at three sites (10, 12 and 13). In agreement with this change we find that site 12 is occupied by chlorophyll a in all Lhcas and sites 10 and 13 are occupied differentially. The distribution of chlorophyll b sites in LHCI is markedly uneven, with three sites located in Lhca2 (2010, 2011 and 2013), two sites found at Lhca1 (site 1009 and 1010), three sites at Lhca4 (4010, 4011 and 4013) and a single site on Lhca3 (site 3011). These findings are consistent with mutational data which identified more chlorophyll b sites on Lhca2 then on Lhca3 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Castelletti et al., 2003</a>). Site 13 on Lhca1, 2 and 4 is probably a mixed site, which can accommodate both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. The high number of chlorophyll b pigments in Lhca2 and the fact that its closest connection to the core is mediated by chlorophyll b (site 2010, shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) is consistent with our suggestion that Lhca1 and Lhca3 are the main junctions for excitation energy transfer from LHCI to the PSI core. The dipole orientations of all but two chlorophylls were identified in the current structure. The most significant changes in LHCI compared to LHCII exist in two sites, 2009 and 4009, where 90\u00b0 rotations are observed. Such a rotation is expected to impact the energy transfer processes within these LHCI subunits but the significance of this change cannot be ascertained from the rotation alone."

The configurations of the pigments themselves differed, with the red pigments of Lhca3 and Lhca4 tilted approximately 12\u00b0 relative to their orientation in LHCII, Lhca1, and Lhca2 due to a second change from a bulky leucine residue at position 64 of LHCII to glycine and alanine in Lhca3 and Lhca4, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>).

In the Lhca1/4 interface, a new carotenoid site (numbered 4505 or L5) forms co-planar \u03c0 systems (plane to plane distance 3.7 \u00c5) with the ring of chlorophyll 4017, positioning it in a configuration that should provide efficient photo-protection from chlorophyll triplets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>).

Under low light conditions, the relatively high luminal pH will result in strong repulsive forces between these negative patches and the acidic domain of VDE, preventing VDE from binding to PSI. Under high light, acidification of lumen, which is known to trigger VDE activity, will result in partial neutralization of these patches and allow VDE access to the PSI-LHCI gap regions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arnoux et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Carotene L4505 is ideally positioned to be exchanged easily via this mechanism (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

After germination, the plants were grown for an additional 10 days under cool-white fluorescent light at a photon flux density of 90\u2013130 \u03bcE m<sup>\u22122</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> in a 14 hr light/10 hr dark cycle at 22\u00b0C. Approximately 200 g of leaves were ground for 25 s in a blender with 1000 ml of ice-cold solution containing 0.3 M sucrose, 15 mM NaCl, 30 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 8), 1 mM PMSF, 15 \u03bcM leupeptin, and 1 \u03bcM pepstatin A. The slurry was filtered through eight layers of cheesecloth and chloroplasts pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 g for 9 min. The pellet was suspended in 500 ml of hypotonic medium (10 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8) to disrupt the chloroplasts. Thylakoids were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min and resuspended in 500 ml of buffer containing 10 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 8) and 150 mM NaCl. The thylakoid membranes were then pelleted at 8,000 g for 10 min and resuspended in a minimal volume of STN2 buffer (0.4 M sucrose, 20 mM Tricine-NaOH, pH 8). The thylakoid concentration was adjusted to 3 mg of chlorophyll per ml and 0.4% n-dodecyl-\u03b1-D-maltoside (DDM) added. This concentration of detergent selectively extracts the ATP synthase, b6f, and PSII complexes. After 5 min incubation on ice, the detergent- treated thylakoid membranes were collected by ultra-centrifugation at 200,000 g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of STN2 buffer, adjusted to 3 mg chlorophyll per ml, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C."

The large size of the crystals helped mitigate the effect of radiation damage, yet only 60\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 of data were collected from each crystal using constant translation of the crystal in the beam. Images were integrated using XDS (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kabsch, 2010</a>) and scaled with XSCALE or AIMLESS (<a href=\"#bib20\">Evans and Murshudov, 2013</a>). Measurements were carried out at the peak of the iron fluorescence scan. Individual datasets generally had I/SIGMA values of \u223c1 at 3.1 \u00c5 with CC1/2 values of \u223c0.5 calculated by XDS. To obtain a more accurate measure of weak reflections, we combined several datasets measured under similar conditions. This combination was possible because of the consistency of the new crystals. The most effective method for combining datasets was to simply choose the sets with the strongest statistics at lower resolutions, and these crystals were also very similar to each other in terms of their unit cell dimensions. The unified datasets contained 40\u2013100 independent measurements of each reflection with I/SIGMA of \u223c1.5 at 2.8 \u00c5 and CC1/2 of \u223c0.4 at the same resolution (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The CCanomalous calculated by XDS or AIMLESS was \u223c0.3 at 6 \u00c5. Some individual datasets had measurable anomalous signals (CCanomalous &gt; 0.3) to 4.5 \u00c5, but the final quality of phases was similar, as judged by the figure of merit for substructures from PHASER runs (typically \u223c0.6 [<a href=\"#bib37\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>]) and visual inspection of the maps."

This solution was used to place the three iron-sulfur clusters, which were subsequently used as the initial substructure for locating additional sites. These initial runs located approximately 40 sites of the 100 that were eventually modeled. Phases were improved using DM (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cowtan, 1994</a>), and the resulting maps showed most of the transmembrane helices of the reaction center with 11 transmembrane helices of LHCI (missing helix 2 of Lhca3). To improve the phases, information from the visible parts of the reaction center was incorporated as a partial MR solution. This model included the 22 transmembrane helices of PsaA and PsaB, the PsaC subunit, and chlorophyll rings, omitting all of the loops from the proteins. From the maps generated in this step, we proceeded to build the model using Coot (<a href=\"#bib18\">Emsley et al., 2010</a>) and used the modified phases as restraints during refinement in either PHENIX (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>) or REFMAC (<a href=\"#bib39\">Murshudov et al., 1997</a>). At various points during the refinement process, the phases were recalculated with the newly modeled sites using PHASER and including the improved model (<a href=\"#bib47\">Read and McCoy, 2011</a>). Final runs identified 99 sites, 89 of them present in the model. The final model refined to an R-free of 25.2% with 3% Ramachandran outliers, a considerable decrease from previous values (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).
