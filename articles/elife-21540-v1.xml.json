Both excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) spinal neurons are necessary for motor behavior, but the influence of recruiting different ratios of E-to-I cells remains unclear. We constructed synthetic microphysical neural networks, called circuitoids, using precise combinations of spinal neuron subtypes derived from mouse stem cells. Circuitoids of purified excitatory interneurons were sufficient to generate oscillatory bursts with properties similar to in vivo central pattern generators. Inhibitory V1 neurons provided dual layers of regulation within excitatory rhythmogenic networks - they increased the rhythmic burst frequency of excitatory V3 neurons, and segmented excitatory motor neuron activity into sub-networks. Accordingly, the speed and pattern of spinal circuits that underlie complex motor behaviors may be regulated by quantitatively gating the intra-network cellular activity ratio of E-to-I neurons."

Both excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) spinal neurons are necessary for motor behavior, but the influence of recruiting different ratios of E-to-I cells remains unclear. We constructed synthetic microphysical neural networks, called circuitoids, using precise combinations of spinal neuron subtypes derived from mouse stem cells. Circuitoids of purified excitatory interneurons were sufficient to generate oscillatory bursts with properties similar to in vivo central pattern generators. Inhibitory V1 neurons provided dual layers of regulation within excitatory rhythmogenic networks - they increased the rhythmic burst frequency of excitatory V3 neurons, and segmented excitatory motor neuron activity into sub-networks. Accordingly, the speed and pattern of spinal circuits that underlie complex motor behaviors may be regulated by quantitatively gating the intra-network cellular activity ratio of E-to-I neurons."

Nevertheless CPGs are not rigid, but can flexibly control when and how fast the muscles are activated to suit the animal's needs. It is thought the circuits are flexible because of the way excitatory and inhibitory neurons interact, but it is not known how these interactions define the behavior of the circuit."

Further work will be needed to test this idea."

Although connectomes and functional roles for the neuronal subtypes that comprise circuits have begun to be defined, the output of large multicellular networks are difficult to predict from the input pattern because the mechanisms that coordinate and regulate these complex systems remain poorly understood. A remarkable attribute of many CNS networks with extensive interconnections among the cells is their ability to default into a sustained self-organized oscillatory activity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Buzsaki, 2006</a>). If only excitatory (E) neurons comprised these networks it is thought that inputs would trigger an avalanche of epileptic activity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Buzsaki, 2006</a>). Thus, inhibitory (I) cells are considered important components of dynamic neural networks, because they can impose a regulated pattern on the system (<a href=\"#bib14\">Brown, 1911</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Buzsaki, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Goulding et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Grillner and Jessell, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Marder and Bucher, 2001</a>)."

While the physiological roles of rhythmic brain activity are not always apparent, oscillatory central pattern generator (CPG) networks underlie breathing, chewing, scratching, and locomotion (<a href=\"#bib32\">Grillner and Jessell, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Marder and Bucher, 2001</a>). Vertebrate CPGs associated with locomotion are distributed networks of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons that represent autonomous units capable of generating precisely patterned rhythmic activity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Feldman and Smith, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Nishimaru et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Whelan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Cowley and Schmidt, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Grillner, 2006</a>). Importantly, spinal CPGs have dynamic features that endow them with the ability to switch their frequency of rhythmicity in order to modulate locomotor speed and change the inter-coordination of motor pool firing patterns to drive different motor behaviors. The basis for producing flexible CPG activity remains unclear (<a href=\"#bib33\">Grillner, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</a>), but it is likely founded in the differential recruitment of excitatory and inhibitory neurons comprising the CPG via selective inputs from descending and sensory systems (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cowley and Schmidt, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gosgnach et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Grillner, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Zhong et al., 2011</a>). However, the contribution of a precisely controlled E/I cell ratio in the context of rhythmic circuit dynamics has been difficult to establish using cell ablation approaches that eliminate entire cell populations or pharmacological applications that silence entire types of synaptic transmission."

A common trait among each class of spinal interneurons comprising the locomotor CPG is that they form an extensive network of interconnections within their subclass, between the interneuron subclasses, and onto motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alvarez et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Crone et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lanuza et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). In addition to their connectivity, the functional role of interneuron subclasses has been investigated by genetic methods such as cell killing or silencing. Ablation of inhibitory V1 neurons slows the burst frequency of the CPG (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gosgnach et al., 2006</a>), whereas ablation of both V1 and V2b inhibitory neurons disrupts the coordination of flexor-extensor alternation (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). Removing the V2a or V3 excitatory neurons from the network results in more irregular CPG bursting (<a href=\"#bib19\">Crone et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). These studies elegantly demonstrate that V1, V2b, V2a, and V3 interneurons each represent a necessary component of the CPG, but they do not address whether the cell types play instructive roles in gating the dynamic features of the circuitry. To begin to address this difficult issue, we used genetically\u00a0labeled neurons to construct synthetic rhythmically\u00a0active neuronal networks composed of defined cell subtypes. This approach allowed us to investigate whether quantitative differences in the cellular E/I ratio of specific neuronal subtypes are sufficient to alter the oscillatory speed and intra-network coordination of bursts."

We found that synthetic networks comprised of only excitatory V2a or V3 interneurons were sufficient to produce stable rhythmic bursts of activity at a frequency similar to drug-evoked fictive locomotor CPG activity. In contrast, V1 inhibitory neurons lacked the ability to produce regular bursts in isolation, but they did affect the activity of other cells. The addition of increasing numbers of V1 (I) neurons to fixed V3 (E) networks quantitatively accelerated the burst frequency, demonstrating that the E/I cell ratio instructively sets the oscillation speed. Interestingly, we found that V1 (I) neurons influenced the activity of motor (E) neuron bursting differently. Motor neuron networks, whose interconnected cells fire in unison, were uncoupled into sub-networks by the addition of increasing numbers of V1 cells. The formation of subnetworks is a form of patterning we define as segmentation. Taken together, our data lead to a model in which input-specific shifts in E/I cellular activity can flexibly tune the speed and pattern of an autonomous oscillatory circuit. By extension, this simple strategy for controlling the oscillatory properties that naturally emerge from interconnected neuronal networks might serve as the basis for generating complex, yet highly flexible, motor behaviors."

Stem cell lines were isolated from blastula embryos harboring fluorescent reporters that indelibly label cardinal populations of spinal neurons as they develop postmitotically and form mature circuits. This allowed us to accurately and sensitively monitor ES cell differentiation into spinal neuron subtypes in real time. We isolated four independent ES cell lines containing the V1 reporter En1:Cre/tdTomato, two lines with the V2a reporter Chx10:Cre/tdTomato, seven lines with the V3 reporter Sim1:Cre/tdTomato, and two lines with the motor neuron reporter tgHb9-GFP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). These ES cell lines were differentiated into neurospheres containing\u00a0~50,000 aggregated cells using retinoic acid (RA) and smoothened agonist (SAG) following procedures similar to those described for generating motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib67\">Peljto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Wichterle and Peljto, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wichterle et al., 2002</a>). These ES-cell-derived neurospheres could be maintained for weeks in culture and were found to contain glia and multiple neuronal subtypes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These cellular aggregates did not appear to adopt a morphological organization that resembled the neural tube or spinal cord, rather neurons and glia seemed to be randomly distributed within the spheres (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, data not shown)."

Since Cir<sup>H</sup> produced reliable high-amplitude bursts, these circuitoids were used to examine the development of and physiological basis for this neuronal activity. Cir<sup>H</sup> spheres are enriched in V3 interneurons but are nonetheless heterogenous mixtures of ventral-spinal cord cell types. We found that\u00a0these circuitoids were spontaneously active at two weeks and bursting increased in frequency at week 5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Acetylcholine receptor antagonists did not significantly alter the spontaneous bursting of circuitoids (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), whereas the glutamatergic AMPA receptor antagonist, CNQX, blocked the activity suggesting that excitatory synaptic drive is necessary for coordinated bursts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Next, we examined how these circuitoids respond to NMA and 5-HT, which trigger rhythmic activity in CPG circuits (evoked condition, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods, <a href=\"#bib46\">Kudo and Yamada, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Smith and Feldman, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Whelan et al., 2000</a>).

Although cell purifications are\u00a0&gt;98% pure (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C)</a>, the low levels of activity found in V1 networks could be due to contamination with small amounts of excitatory neurons because inhibitory antagonists increased burst amplitude and rhythmicity, and a glutamatergic AMPA receptor blocker, CNQX, stopped the activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4N\u2013Q and T</a>).

After application of the inhibitory antagonists, the cultures returned to the bursting pattern observed without V1 neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B, D, F and G</a>). These findings reveal three aspects of the synthetic networks. First, the effect of inhibitory neurons is mediated by direct synaptic activity rather than causing changes in the development, survival, or physiological properties of V3 cells because picrotoxin and strychnine quickly restored V3 activity to its normal frequency. Second, the addition of V1 cells to V3 networks unlikely changes V3-activity by displacing cells or altering the connectome of the excitatory network because drug inhibitors of V1 interneurons restore normal V3-activity. Third, excitatory networks may tune their burst rate by flexibly recruiting different numbers of inhibitory neurons."

Rather than measuring average neuronal bursts across the entire network we measured activity in sub-regions. In networks with a 10:1 motor neuron/V1 ratio, we found that separate regions of interest (ROI) could burst independently (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Changes in the coordination of neuronal activity across the network were not due to depletion of excitatory interconnections among motor neurons or a physical alteration of the circuit's connectome, because inhibitory antagonists caused the network to rapidly switch back into a synchronous bursting pattern (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The desynchronizing effect of inhibitory neurons on motor neuron networks was quantified as network complexity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods).

Equal numbers of motor neurons and excitatory V3 interneurons were combined with increasing numbers of V1 inhibitory cells. We found that the tripartite circuitoids maintained their synchrony across the network regardless of V1 cell number (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>).

Despite the extensive characterization of this circuit, it has remained unclear what drives the pacemaker system within the CPG. Several studies have found that perturbing the function of excitatory interneurons such as V2a or V3 cells degrades the rhythm. Likewise, we found that V3 interneurons are necessary for well-coordinated rhythmicity in heterogeneous networks. In addition, we found that V3 cells, V2a interneurons, and to a limited degree motor neurons were sufficient as isolated cell populations to establish rhythmic networks. These homogenous networks displayed somewhat regular spontaneous bursting patterns, but fired with increased frequency and higher regularity in drugs that evoke central pattern generator activity. It has been suggested that the pacemaker is an emergent property of interconnected excitatory neurons within the CPG, and that the default frequency is defined by the biophysical properties of the membrane, which cyclically convert cells from on-fire to off-fire states (<a href=\"#bib33\">Grillner, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Harris-Warrick, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kiehn et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Marder and Bucher, 2001</a>). The inherent ability of a network to integrate neural properties across the cell population may represent one mechanism for helping to control for the intrinsic biophysical variability among neurons and thereby ensure a reliable and consistent output (<a href=\"#bib57\">Marder et al., 2015</a>). Our findings support this view of pacemaker control and further suggest that robustness in the system is derived from the ability of multiple excitatory spinal cord cell types to default into regular oscillatory patterns."

Although the ES-cell-derived neuron subtypes used in this analysis without exception displayed features similar to their in vivo counterparts, we cannot exclude that there are differences between the in vitro and in vivo cells. The de novo generated neurons were either cultured as spheres or plated and allowed to form interconnections. Remarkably, after culturing we found that these synthetic networks produced rhythmic bursts of activity that resembled the activity of the spinal cord central pattern generator. Because these ES-cell-derived neural networks produced a behaviorally relevant activity pattern, we termed these microphysical systems circuitoids to distinguish them from neurospheres defined solely by their cellular composition. Pharmacological experiments and recordings of EPSCs indicated that circuitoid activity is synaptically driven, and that the synchronized bursting of the neurons comprising each circuitoid is likely a byproduct of the extensive interconnections among the cells. In addition to synaptic connections, gap junctions may also form among neurons in circuitoids. Nevertheless, antagonists of glutamatergic synapses disrupted bursting, indicating that gap junctions alone are insufficient to produce the oscillatory patterns of activity we observed. We found no evidence for migration of neurons into particular groupings or layers within the oscillatory-circuitoids in either aggregated or plated conditions; nor did we find evidence for a specific connectome among cells, other than cell-type-specific differences in network binding strength revealed in mEPSC recordings. Instead, the oscillatory activity we observed under a variety of conditions seemed to emerge simply from the intrinsic synaptic and membrane channel characteristics of the neuron subtypes and their ability to form extensive synaptic connections with one another. Our findings indicate that the coordinated oscillatory behavior of a rhythmic network can arise without a stringent requirement for a particular circuit architecture that relies upon a specific physical arrangement of pre- and post-synaptic cells.

Although we could not mimic the structured recruitment of cell types by descending inputs, we could investigate the consequence of changing the E/I balance of networks by mixing different combinations of excitatory and inhibitory neuron subtypes. V1 interneurons increased the burst frequency of strongly interconnected V3 networks in proportion to the E/I cell ratio (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>), suggesting V1 interneuron influence on network speed can occur upstream of motor neurons. When V1 inhibitory neurons were combined with weakly connected motor neurons they had little influence on burst frequency, but they caused sub-networks to emerge in proportion to the E/I cell ratio (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Although our findings do not explain how the activity of different motor pools is coordinated, our results support the possibility that the selective recruitment of increasing numbers of V1 cells could switch motor pools from a coupled (synchronous) to an uncoupled (segmented) state in order to facilitate the differential recruitment of muscles during complex behaviors (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). In tripartite circuits with weakly- and strongly-connected excitatory neurons in combination with inhibitory neurons, we found that the entire network adopted a synchronous pattern of activity whose frequency increased as the number of inhibitory neurons increased (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). The selective recruitment of V1 cells into the CPG may be facilitated by the large genetic diversity that has been uncovered within this cell group (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bikoff et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Francius et al., 2013</a>)."

Together these features are sufficient to control the speed and segmentation of bursting.

TIFF stacks were imported into R for analysis. Stacks were transformed into 196 \u2018signals\u2019 where each signal is the averaged intensity vs time from an 11 \u00d7 11 pixel oval shaped ROI. ROIs were taken at nine pixel spacing to allow for a small amount of overlap between adjacent ROIs. The size of the ROIs was selected manually based on training data to maintain good detail while still averaging out imaging noise. Signals were smoothed with a 1\u00a0s wide running mean filter and delta-f / f transformed. The full set of ROIs from a movie was then PCA transformed. The principal components were separated into \u2018signal\u2019 and \u2018noise\u2019 using the scree-plot method of significant component estimation (finding the component number at the elbow of the plot). Based on training data, we occasionally found that information was lost by selecting the component at the elbow of the scree-plot so, instead, selected two past the elbow. The significant components were recombined to form the signal matrix and all non-significant components were recombined to form the noise matrix. The sum of these two matrices is equal to the original input to PCA. For each signal, the standard deviation of the noise version was used to threshold the signal version for burst location calling. Burst locations were identified as rising edges in the signal version of an ROI with change in intensity greater than approximately 1.96 times the standard deviation of the noise version of the same ROI. This threshold was selected manually based on training data and gave a good balance between false-positive and false-negative burst calling. Change in intensity was measured from the base to peak of the rising edge of the burst."

Each ROI was then re-described as a sequence of the cataloged bursts. We then filtered out bursts from the catalog that appeared in less than 4% of the ROIs. This threshold was set manually based on training data to balance out Type I and Type II error as fair as possible and then used for all primary analysis. After filtering, the ROIs were re-described again. This re-described set of ROIs represents all robust bursting activity within a single movie. To quantify the complexity, taken as a deviation from the state of all ROIs having identical activity, we built a directed graph of the burst sequences within a movie. Briefly, a graph is a type of data structure with one or more nodes connected by edges. They are often used to describe networks. If the edges are assigned a direction then the graph is a directed graph. In our case, the nodes are the cataloged bursts. Edges were added to the graph between any two bursts that occurred adjacently in time in any ROI. The direction of the edge is in the direction of occurrence in time. If, in one ROI, burst Y followed burst X and was adjacent to burst X (no bursts occurred between them) then an edge would be added connecting from X to Y. From the point of view of a node in the graph, edges may be incoming or outgoing. The foregoing connection of X to Y has a single edge. From the point of view of node X it is an outgoing edge while from the point of view of Y it is an incoming edge. Complexity of a movie was then defined as the average of both the ratio of nodes with more than one outgoing edge and ratio of nodes with more than one incoming edge. If all ROIs in a movie have the same burst sequence then, in terms of the graph, each node would only be connected to one other node resulting in a baseline score of 1 for the movie. When the ROIs share some bursts, but not all, then the nodes of the graph begin to have more than one incoming or outgoing edge, which increases the final complexity score. We did not consider a case for ROIs that do not share any bursts because we did not observe any such cases in our data. The complexity statistic was found to be non-normal across the different testing groups and to have unequal variances so the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to perform statistical tests between groups. All other data were compared using a student t-test."

It uses embryonic stem cells that have cell type specific reporter genes and FACS to generate cultures of spinal interneurons and motor neurons of prescribed composition and then uses genetically expressed Ca indicators and electrophysiology to monitor activity and synaptic properties. It then creatively makes different circuitoids and dissects their circuit mechanisms for generating spontaneous bursting by pharmacological and genetic cell killing methods. The paper is brilliant in its concept and a great pleasure to read and think about. Its main conclusion is that strong excitatory connections lead to robust bursting and that when such strong interconnections are present then local inhibition promotes synchrony and decreasing the E/I ratio speeds bursting (decreases period). Conversely weak excitatory connections lead to less robust bursting and when such weak interconnections dominate the circuitoids then local inhibition disrupts synchrony and decreasing the E/I ratio leads to fractionation of the network into co-active subcircuits. The thoroughness and systematics of the approach are impressive and the results are nicely quantified and clearly presented in the figures. This paper should be read by all who are interested in brain circuits."

This is perhaps understandable because in the circuitoids inhibition is unstructured \u2013 random. You must redirect the entire paper's conceptual framework to embrace the concept that basic antagonisms that are so characteristic of CPGs require a structured pattern inhibitory connectivity. The authors produce something akin to Pearson's flexor burst generator or the PreBotz complex of the respiratory CPG, i.e., a neuronal oscillator, rather than a CPG which has both rhythm and patterning components. We would also argue that some antagonisms are probably hard wired and not that plastic to descending selection. Some of course are easily selected in/out but still are dependent on a structured pattern of inhibitory connectivity. The network fractionation that the authors observe when adding V1 interneurons to MN cultures is not equivalent to building basic antagonisms such as flexor extensor antagonisms or, in axial locomotion, side-to-side antagonisms. Both in Introduction and in Discussion this limitation of the approach should be forthrightly dealt with. The authors have not built a CPG in a dish and they can recognize this limitation without losing the inherent interest of the paper."

The whole cell patch recordings of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H-J</a> give some confidence that there are synapses \u2013 concomitant suction electrode recordings of the bursts would certainly increase that confidence \u2013 but some anatomical corroboration seems necessary. This could be done at the LM level with, e.g., with immunocytochemistry to show vGluT2 boutons in apposition to glutamatergic receptors, or at minimum in apposition to post-synaptic neurons."

The authors should not refer to pattern in their title and should precisely define what they mean by pattern: segmentation of circuitoid activity without fixed coordination.

In the locomotor field, to which the authors are directing their study, the word \"pattern\" refers to the coordination of muscle groups or motoneuron pools. There is no evidence presented in this manuscript that supports such coordination. The authors do show data related to \"sub-networks\" in which they show that when one group of MNs burst, another group may not. But this is far from any pattern per se, and could have many explanations (threshold effect, synaptic failure in a sparsely innervated system, as 2 examples).

This is perhaps understandable because in the circuitoids inhibition is unstructured \u2013 random. You must redirect the entire paper's conceptual framework to embrace the concept that basic antagonisms that are so characteristic of CPGs require a structured pattern inhibitory connectivity. The authors produce something akin to Pearson's flexor burst generator or the PreBotz complex of the respiratory CPG, i.e., a neuronal oscillator, rather than a CPG which has both rhythm and patterning components. We would also argue that some antagonisms are probably hard wired and not that plastic to descending selection. Some of course are easily selected in/out but still are dependent on a structured pattern of inhibitory connectivity. The network fractionation that the authors observe when adding V1 interneurons to MN cultures is not equivalent to building basic antagonisms such as flexor extensor antagonisms or, in axial locomotion, side-to-side antagonisms. Both in Introduction and in Discussion this limitation of the approach should be forthrightly dealt with. The authors have not built a CPG in a dish and they can recognize this limitation without losing the inherent interest of the paper.</i> "
