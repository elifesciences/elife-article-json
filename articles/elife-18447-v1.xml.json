After entering the nucleus, uracilated viral DNA products are degraded by the uracil base excision repair (UBER) machinery with less than 1% of the uracilated DNA successfully integrating. Although uracilated proviral DNA showed few mutations, the viral genomic RNA was highly mutated, suggesting that errors occur during transcription. Viral DNA isolated from blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages (but not T cells) of drug-suppressed HIV-infected individuals also contained abundant uracils. The presence of viral uracils in short-lived monocytes suggests their recent infection through contact with virus producing cells in a tissue reservoir. These findings reveal new elements of a viral defense mechanism involving host UBER that may be relevant to the establishment and persistence of HIV-1 infection."

After entering the nucleus, uracilated viral DNA products are degraded by the uracil base excision repair (UBER) machinery with less than 1% of the uracilated DNA successfully integrating. Although uracilated proviral DNA showed few mutations, the viral genomic RNA was highly mutated, suggesting that errors occur during transcription. Viral DNA isolated from blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages (but not T cells) of drug-suppressed HIV-infected individuals also contained abundant uracils. The presence of viral uracils in short-lived monocytes suggests their recent infection through contact with virus producing cells in a tissue reservoir. These findings reveal new elements of a viral defense mechanism involving host UBER that may be relevant to the establishment and persistence of HIV-1 infection."

When this happens, the cell removes the dUTP from the DNA using enzymes in a process called uracil base excision repair (UBER). To hide inside the cell\u2019s genome, HIV-1 needs to produce a DNA copy of its own genome, but it was not known what happens when HIV-1 tries to do this within a macrophage that contains high levels of dUTP and UBER enzymes."

However, about one in a hundred viral DNA molecules do manage to successfully integrate into the genome of the macrophage. This viral DNA later gives rise to new virus particles through an error-prone process that, by introducing new mutations into the virus genome, may help HIV-1 to evolve and persist."

These precursor cells only live for several days before being eliminated, so the presence of viruses containing dUTP suggests these cells were infected recently.

The most well-characterized uracil-centric innate immune response involves host cell DNA cytidine deaminase enzymes (APOBECs), which selectively deaminate cytosine residues during (-) strand DNA synthesis thereby rendering the viral genome nonfunctional by hypermutation (C/G to T/A). Work from our lab and others has suggested the presence of another uracil-mediated HIV-1 restriction pathway involving the incorporation of dUTP into viral DNA by reverse transcriptase to produce U/A base pairs ('uracilation') (<a href=\"#bib70\">Weil et al., 2013</a>). The dUTP-dependent pathway is thought to be restricted to non-dividing immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes and resting CD4+ T cells because only non-dividing cells have the requisite low levels of canonical dNTPs and elevated ratios of dUTP/ TTP (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yan et al., 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib35\">Kennedy et al., 2011</a>). Notably, U/A pairs resulting from dUTP incorporation are 'invisible' to normal DNA sequencing methods and they retain the coding potential of normal T/A base pairs. Despite the similarity of U/A and T/A pairs, the presence of uracil in DNA has the potential to introduce diverse effects on viral infection including transcriptional silencing and engagement of the host uracil base excision repair (UBER) pathway (<a href=\"#bib6\">Br\u00e9geon et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Krokan et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2014b</a>). The presence, persistence, and ultimate fate of U/A pairs in HIV-1 proviral DNA is unexplored and is important for understanding the potential of tissue macrophages to establish and maintain a long-term HIV reservoir."

A dUTP-mediated host defense pathway was first suggested from inspection of the genomes of \u03b2-retroviruses, non-primate lentiviruses, and endogenous retroviruses, which have all captured a host dUTPase gene during viral evolution. Additional support was provided by the observation that dUTPase-deficient mutants of non-primate lentiviruses cannot infect non-dividing cells that contain high-dUTP levels\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib43\">Lichtenstein et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Turelli\u00a0et\u00a0al., 1996</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib66\">Threadgill\u00a0et\u00a0al., 1993</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib64\">Steagall et al., 1995</a>). Intriguingly, HIV-1 does not encode a dUTPase yet can infect human macrophages with a reported dUTP:TTP ratio of 60:1 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kennedy et al., 2011</a>). There is an equal level of intrigue concerning the role of hUNG2 in HIV infection. A <i>pro-infective</i> role for hUNG2 has been suggested by reports that hUNG2 suppresses mutations in the viral genome upon infection of macrophages (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mansky et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2004</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib49\">Priet et al., 2005</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib25\">Guenzel et al., 2012</a>), but is completely dispensable for HIV-1 replication of cells with low-dUTP levels (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaiseer and Emerman, 2006</a>). In contrast, a modest <i>restrictive</i> role for hUNG2 has been suggested from the decreased infectivity of HIV virions lacking viral protein R (Vpr). This restriction is attributed to a Vpr-dependent ubiquitin-mediated hUNG2 degradation pathway or through Vpr-induced transcriptional silencing of hUNG2 expression\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib59\">Schrofelbauer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ahn et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib42\">Langevin et al., 2009</a>). These intriguing prior observations have motivated our further studies into the role of UBER in HIV infection, which now establish a profoundly restrictive role and unexpected effects on viral mutagenesis."

Ex-Seq is similar to standard IIlumina sequencing (Seq), except that UNG-mediated uracil excision is used to destroy uracil-containing templates prior to PCR amplification. To specifically enrich HIV-1 sequences, we used 5\u2019-biotin-conjugated DNA probes that tiled both strands of the entire viral genome, yielding a 10<sup>3</sup>-fold increase in HIV-derived fragments. Sequencing of viral DNA isolated from MDMs 7 days after infection with HIV<sup>NL4.3(VSVG)</sup> showed uniform coverage across the genome except for notably increased reads at the 5\u00b4 and 3\u00b4-LTR regions, which was equally evident for both the Seq and Ex-Seq samples (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We speculate that the elevated signal in the LTRs arises from non-uniform hybridization of the lock-down probes, which is normalized when converting the reads to Frac U. The ratio of the normalized sequencing reads (Ex-Seq/Seq) thus quantifies the fraction that contained at least one uracil on each strand (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Thus, about 60% of the 100 bp reads contained uracil, leading us to conclude that uracilation was uniform across the viral genome."

We excluded APOBEC-catalyzed cytidine deamination as a major source of viral uracils in infected MDMs using several criteria. First, Ex-Seq data showed that the uracils appeared on <i>both</i> strands of the viral cDNA rather than the (-) strand that is exclusively targeted by APOBECs (<a href=\"#bib75\">Yu et al., 2004</a>). Second, the mutational spectrum of proviral DNA did not match the signature C/G\u2192T/A hotspots for APOBEC cytosine deamination as determined using the program <i>Hypermut</i> 2.0 (see sequencing studies below) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rose and Korber, 2000</a>). Finally, we obtained direct evidence that viral uracils originated from the high dUTP/TTP ratio by increasing the intracellular TTP levels through the addition of 5\u2009mM thymidine to the culture media. Addition of thymidine to the culture medium prior to infection led to a 14-fold decrease in the uracilation level of proviral DNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and a five-fold increase in proviral copies as compared to no thymidine supplementation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The combined results strongly support a mechanism where the viral uracils originate primarily from dUTP incorporation during reverse transcription. Since reverse transcriptase utilizes dUTP with the same efficiency and fidelity as TTP\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib35\">Kennedy et al., 2011</a>), the uracils must be in\u00a0the form of coding U/A base pairs. In <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, we present immunoblots showing that MDMs express very low levels of A3G and A3A, which is consistent with previous reports and the absence of tell-tale marks of enzymatic deamination described above (<a href=\"#bib27\">Harris and Liddament, 2004</a>)."

This level of infection based on GFP fluorescence remained constant from about seven to 30 days after infection and did not change when the MOI was varied in the range 0.1\u201310 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This result led us to suspect that the MDM population might consist of a phenotypic mixture with different susceptibilities to HIV infection. (We note that higher MOIs are typically used in our experiments to obtain reasonable viral copy numbers in the GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> population, but the results are independent of MOI.) Accordingly, we used GFP fluorescence to sort HIV<sup>NL4.3(VSVG)</sup> infected MDMs into 99% pure GFP positive and negative populations (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Droplet digital PCR measurements showed that the copy number of early viral <i>gag</i>-containing DNA products in the GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> population was about seven-fold lower than the GFP<sup>+</sup> population at 1 day post-infection (~2 versus 14 copies/cell, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

First, the infected MDMs were sorted into GFP positive and negative populations at 1 day post-infection. The cells were then cultured at days 1, 7, 14, and 30 post-sorting where we measured proviral DNA copy number, the fraction of proviruses containing uracil, and the HIV p24 levels in the culture supernatants for each cell population (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Both MDM populations showed high levels of viral <i>gag</i> DNA products at day 1 (red circle and blue square, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The GFP<sup>+</sup> population was characterized by efficient integration and a high proviral DNA copy number that remained stable for 14 days. By day 30, the copy number increased by ~four-fold, which we attribute to secondary infection by released viruses (white bars, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In contrast, the GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> population had a low efficiency of integration exemplified by a 50-fold reduction in copy number between the early <i>gag</i> DNA products and proviruses (black bars, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Unlike the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, the proviral copy number in the GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> population decreased by 20-fold between days 7 and 14 before returning to the day 7 level at 30 days. Once again, we attributed the later increase to secondary infection by released virus particles because it was not observed in single-round infections. We established that HIV<sup>NL4.3(VSVG)</sup>,\u00a0HIV<sup>SF162(CCR5)</sup>, and HIV<sup>BAL(CCR5)</sup>\u00a0viral strains and MDMs isolated from different donors behaved similarly (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013E</a>), and that the results were independent of whether differentiated MDMs were obtained using adherence, M-CSF or GM-CSF protocols (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3F\u2013H</a>)."

The fraction of proviral copies that were uracilated (Frac U) decreased from 0.77 to 0.23 between days 7 and 14 before rising to 0.55 at day 30 (presumably due to continuing infection). We explored the mechanistic basis for the differences in viral uracilation between the two MDM populations by measuring the dUTP/TTP ratio in the cell extracts obtained from each. The GFP<sup>+</sup> MDMs had a 20-fold lower dUTP/TTP ratio, which stemmed in part from a five-fold higher TTP concentration compared to the GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> MDMs. This difference between the GFP+ and negative MDMs confirms the key mechanistic requirement for viral uracilation: a high dUTP/TTP ratio."

Our reasoning is based on the reports that CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes are enriched in the CCR5 co-receptor and are the preferred target of HIV as compared to the more prevalent CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes which express lower levels of CCR5 and appreciable levels of the active low-molecular-weight forms of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3G\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Ellery et al., 2007</a>). In addition, CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes typically comprise around 10% of the monocyte pool in uninfected donors (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ellery et al., 2007</a>), which curiously matches the level of GFP<sup>+</sup> MDMs in our studies. Despite these suggestive relationships, multicolor flow cytometry established that the GFP fluorescence did not track with the CD14<sup>+</sup> or CD16<sup>+</sup> status of the MDMs (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Aside from the 20-fold higher dUTP levels in the GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> MDMs (see above), we have no comprehensive understanding of what additional phenotypic differences exist between the two macrophage populations that result in the combined GFP<sup>\u2212</sup>/uracilation phenotype.

To confirm this result in MDMs, we took advantage of three approaches: (i) knockdown of hUNG2 activity by transfection with a plasmid vector that overexpressed the potent uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein (Ugi) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bennett et al., 1993</a>), (ii) overexpression of hUNG2 by transfection with a plasmid expression vector, and (iii) infections with viral constructs where virus protein R (Vpr) was deleted. Viral protein R is known to interact with hUNG2 and induce its degradation through the assembly with the DDB1-CUL4 ubiquitin ligase complex and would be expected to recapitulate the phenotype produced by Ugi overexpression (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eldin et al., 2014</a>). We surmised that reduced hUNG2 levels would lead to greater infection efficiency, higher levels of uracil in viral DNA products, and that greater expression of hUNG2 would correlate with increased restriction and reduced uracil content in proviral DNA due to uracil excision by hUNG2. It is important to note that plasmid DNA transfection methodology is essential in these experiments because the introduction of Ugi and hUNG2 through lentiviral packaging and transfection would be compromised by uracilation during reverse transcription."

The EVR copies present in the supernatant of GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> MDMs at three days post-cytokine stimulation was about 100-fold lower than the GFP<sup>+</sup> population, independent of cytokine stimulation. The lower copies of genomic RNA produced from the uracilated proviruses in GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> MDMs is comparable to the reduced proviral copy number in this population.

We also found that inflammatory cytokine IFN\u03b3 stimulation reduced the EVR copy number in both MDM populations by almost 10-fold (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), which is therefore not correlated with the uracilation phenotype."

Upon entry into the macrophage, reverse transcriptase (RT) encounters a nucleotide pool environment that favors the incorporation of dUTP into HIV DNA products predominantly in the form of U/A base pairs. The high ratio of dUTP/TTP is maintained, at least in part, by the low levels of dUTPase expression combined with the high expression levels of SAMHD1 in macrophages. Uracilation of the viral DNA can proceed to high levels in the cytoplasmic compartment because the UBER machinery is sequestered in the nucleus. However, when the heavily uracilated HIV DNA enters the nucleus it is attacked and fragmented by nuclear UBER enzymes. Fragmentation is initiated by hUNG2 uracil excision, and is likely followed by abasic site excision by human abasic site endonuclease (APE1 or APE2) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schrader et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Stavnezer et al., 2014</a>). We estimate, based on comparing the measured levels of early and proviral DNA levels in the GFP<sup>\u2212</sup> MDMs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), that ~99% of the viral DNA is destroyed before the integration step and further destruction at the proviral stage is observed over the next 14 days (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This pathway differs from original models of APOBEC3G-mediated virus restriction in that uracils are introduced on both DNA strands and they are not inherently mutagenic (<a href=\"#bib50\">Priet et al., 2006</a>)."

In non-dividing MDMs, we found that uracilated proviruses contained few mutations yet gave rise to mutated viral genomic RNAs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Although it is tempting to attribute these mutations to RNAP II transcriptional errors as it encounters uracil on the template DNA strand, RNAP II shows high-fidelity incorporation of A opposite to U during in vitro transcription <a href=\"#bib46\">Menendez-Arias, 2009</a>. Moreover, many aspects of the mutation spectrum in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> are not reconcilable with RNAP II incorporating incorrect bases opposite a template U (although the frequent A\u2192G transitions may be explained by the potential of U to pair with A or G) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kuraoka, 2002</a>). The actual error mechanism is likely to be much more complex given that transcription coupled repair is expected to generate abasic sites, strand breaks, and even gaps when densely spaced uracils are excised. In this regard, RNAP II is known to stall at isolated abasic sites during in vitro transcription and could also misincorporate various ribonucleotides at such sites in\u00a0vivo (<a href=\"#bib76\">Yu et al., 2003</a>)."

Faithful repair could involve the reincorporation of U opposite to A due to the perturbed nucleotide pools, or the introduction of T. The observation that RNA mutations were increased upon stimulation with the inflammatory cytokine IFN\u03b3, and nearly absent in the presence of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4, indicates that the transcriptional programs induced by these cytokines are highly relevant to the outcome; a further understanding of this complex problem is of considerable interest. Although errors introduced by IFN\u03b3 stimulation may frequently lead to non-functional viral genomes, they also allow the viral DNA sequence to evolve rapidly in the absence of reverse transcription. Replication-competent viruses that emerge would then undergo fitness selection in the host. These potential outcomes make UBER a double-edged sword with respect to propagation of viral infection."

Total genomic DNA was isolated using a QIamp DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Genomic DNA was first fragmented using the endonuclease BSAJ-1 (1 U) in Cutsmart buffer (NEB) for 1\u2009hr at 60\u00b0C. Uracil containing DNA sequences were digested using 50 nM UNG in 1x TMNB+ buffer (10\u2009mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 20\u2009mM NaCl, 11\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.002% Brij-35). Reactions were cleaned up using a MinElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen). UNG or mock digested DNA were diluted in to a PCR master mix containing (1x Platinum taq buffer, 1x droplet stabilizer (RainDance Technologies, Billerica, MA), 1\u2009mM dNTPs, 0.9\u2009\u03bcM forward and reverse primers, 0.15\u2009\u03bcM probe, 2\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5\u2009\u03bcM carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX, Sigma) as a passive reference dye, 1 U platinum taq polymerase and varying amounts of template DNA and loaded in to a RainDance source chip (RainDance Technologies). Different primer/probe sets were designed to tile the HIV genome to report on heterogeneity of uracil incorporation. Amplification was performed with the following thermal program: 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, followed by 44 cycles of: 95\u00b0C for 15 s and then 60\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, followed by a final step of heating to 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. The final high-temperature cycle cures the droplets. For each step, the ramp cycle time was decreased to 0.5\u00b0C/s. Amplification samples were transferred to a RainDance Sense instrument. Copy numbers of the human RNase P (<i>RPP30</i>) gene were measured in the same reaction mixture to determine cell number. DNA isolated from the Jurkat-based cell line (J-Lat) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jordan et al., 2003</a>) containing a full-length integrated HIV genome was used to establish gating parameters for HIV and RPP30-positive droplets. J-Lat cells were obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: J-Lat Full Length Clone (clone 9846) from Dr. Eric Verdin. Ex-ddPCR data were analyzed using the RainDrop Analyst software package (RainDance Technologies). Drop-size gating was performed to remove drops of atypical size using a lower and upper size gate boundary for each PMT of 800 and 1150, respectively. Intact drops for each of the three clusters (one negative; quenched drops, and two positive; PMT1+ and PMT2+) were gated independently using the ellipse-gating tool. Gated clusters were spectrally compensated using the following definitions: (intact drops/quenched drops) as the negative control for both PMT1+ and PMT2+, while (intact drops/PMT1+) and (intact drops/PMT2+) were selected for PMT1+ and PMT2+, respectively. Positive cluster gating on spectrally compensated data was again achieved by using the ellipse-gating tool. A Poisson correction statistic was applied to both positive targets (HIV and <i>RPP30</i>) to remove sampling error (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sanders et al., 2011</a>). Determination of uracil-free DNA transcripts was determined using <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>."

This is due to the fact that identical DNA samples are used for the PCR amplification steps. Thus, the fraction of the proviral population that contains uracil within the <i>gag</i> amplicon may be reliably measured."

The HIV<sup>BAL(CCR5)</sup> virus was obtained through NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH (cat. no. 510; contributors: Dr. Suzanne Gartner, Dr. Mikulas Popovic and Dr. Robert Gallo). Briefly, CD4+ T cells isolated from PBMCs of an HIV-1-negative donor were purified using a negative selection method (CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell Isolation Kit II, Miltenyi Biotec) and activated with PHA for 3 days in IL-2-containing medium. A spinoculation method (2\u2009hr, 37\u00b0C, 1200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g) was used to infect activated CD4+ T cells with replication-competent HIV<sup>BaL(CCR5)</sup> virus (300 ng p24/10<sup>6</sup> cells). Following incubation for 6 days in IL-2 containing media, supernatants were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Freshly isolated CD4+ T cells were activated by \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD28 stimulation for 3 days in IL-2 containing medium and then plated (100\u2009\u03bcL/well) into a 96-well v-bottom plate. HIV<sup>BaL(CCR5)</sup> (500 ng p24/10<sup>6</sup> cells) was added to each well and cells were infected by spinoculation. Following infection, cells were suspended in 40\u00a0mL of IL-2 containing medium supplemented with enfuvirtide (10\u2009\u03bcM) to prevent additional rounds of viral replication. Following a 2-day incubation at 37\u00b0C, genomic DNA was extracted from 10<sup>7</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> cells using the Qiagen Gentra Purgene Cell Kit A. DNA was subjected to a nested limiting dilution PCR protocol adapted from <i>Ho et al</i>. with the following modifications: 30 cycles were run for the outer PCR, 40 cycles were run for each inner PCR, and all clonal outer wells were subjected to the 4 inner PCRs (A-D; corresponding to gag, pol, rev and env regions) regardless if positive or negative for the gag inner PCR (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ho et al., 2013</a>)."

Cells were maintained in culture for 14 days prior to cytokine simulation and supernatant collection. Extracellular viral RNA was collected from the supernatants of individual wells that contained the fewest number of input cells and were p24-positive in an attempt to obtain virus released from a cell containing a single provirus.

There is a major restriction, involving UBER, in levels of proviral DNAs that are formed (only 1% of normal levels get through the restriction); and second, there is a high level of mutation in the resulting RNAs that are formed from the U-containing but not mutated proviruses, for obscure reasons (presumably during forward transcription). This last point is intriguing if mysterious."

As it turns out, these two populations are defined by the artificial expression of GFP, a marker of transfection for the viral genome(s) introduced; i.e., the GFP+ population expressed 7x the level of virus and virus-encoded products relative to the GFP- (essentially low or non-transfected) cell population. The authors never really address the differences in these populations other than obvious susceptibility to transfection,virus expression and relative uracilation. It seems probable that the GFP+ cells were more susceptible to transfection due to higher metabolic rate, most likely due to some stage of activation not extant in the GFP- population. The higher dUTP:dTTP ratio and lower virus integration/production would be consistent with this interpretation. It is unclear the extent to which uracil misincorporation might contribute to this, but seems unlikely to be the primary factor in low virus integration/expression."

We are actively pursuing metabolic profiling of these cell types to further elucidate their differences. However, this extensive work is the basis for another independent manuscript."
