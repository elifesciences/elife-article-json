We investigated the composition and distribution of shaker-type-potassium channels (Kv1 channels) within the nodal complex of myelinated axons following injury. At the neuroma that forms after damage, expression of Kv1.1 and 1.2 (normally localised to the juxtaparanode) was markedly decreased. In contrast Kv1.4 and 1.6, which were hardly detectable in the na\u00efve state, showed increased expression within juxtaparanodes and paranodes following injury, both in rats and humans. Within the dorsal root (a site remote from injury) we noted a redistribution of Kv1-channels towards the paranode. Blockade of Kv1 channels with \u03b1-DTX after injury reinstated hyperexcitability of A-fibre axons and enhanced mechanosensitivity. Changes in the molecular composition and distribution of axonal Kv1 channels, therefore represents a protective mechanism to suppress the hyperexcitability of myelinated sensory axons that follows nerve injury."

We investigated the composition and distribution of shaker-type-potassium channels (Kv1 channels) within the nodal complex of myelinated axons following injury. At the neuroma that forms after damage, expression of Kv1.1 and 1.2 (normally localised to the juxtaparanode) was markedly decreased. In contrast Kv1.4 and 1.6, which were hardly detectable in the na\u00efve state, showed increased expression within juxtaparanodes and paranodes following injury, both in rats and humans. Within the dorsal root (a site remote from injury) we noted a redistribution of Kv1-channels towards the paranode. Blockade of Kv1 channels with \u03b1-DTX after injury reinstated hyperexcitability of A-fibre axons and enhanced mechanosensitivity. Changes in the molecular composition and distribution of axonal Kv1 channels, therefore represents a protective mechanism to suppress the hyperexcitability of myelinated sensory axons that follows nerve injury."

Soon after nerve damage occurred, nearly all of these ion channels disappeared from the juxtaparanode.

They are formed by heteromultimers of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits (<a href=\"#bib34\">MacKinnon, 1991</a>). The characteristics of the outward currents they carry depend on subunit composition. Sensory neurons are known to express Kv1 channels and functionally these channels have been shown to limit excitability of sensory neurons: For instance Kv1.2 suppresses excitability at the level of the sensory neuron cell body (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gold et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rasband et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Everill et al., 1998</a>) and Kv1.1 acts as a \u2018brake\u2019 on mechanosensitivity at the terminals of C-mechano-nociceptor and A\u03b2-mechanoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hao et al., 2013</a>). Kv1 channels also act as excitability brakes for cold thermal sensitivity in intact and damaged axons of primary sensory neurons (many of such fibres are also mechano-sensitive) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Roza et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Madrid et al., 2009</a>). Kv1 channels are known to be expressed in the juxtaparanodal region of myelinated sensory axons.

Nodes are flanked by the paranode, which is an important point of attachment between the axon and the terminal loops of the Schwann cell. Just inside the innermost axoglial junction of the paranode is the juxtaparanode a domain enriched in Kv1 channels Kv1.1 and 1.2. The localisation of Kv1.1 and 1.2 to the juxtaparanode is dependent on the formation of a molecular scaffold, which includes the adhesion molecules caspr2 and TAG-1 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Poliak et al., 2003</a>). In the na\u00efve state in adulthood, the juxtaparanodal Kv1 channels are thought not to\u00a0have a major influence on axon conduction properties of peripheral myelinated axons (<a href=\"#bib44\">Poliak et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chiu and Ritchie, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Sherratt et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rasband et al., 1998</a>), probably because they are electrically insulated from the node of Ranvier under the myelin sheath. However during development (<a href=\"#bib59\">Vabnick et al., 1999</a>) and following primary demyelination (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rasband et al., 1998</a>) (during which myelin is removed but the axon remains intact), Kv1.1 and 1.2 become more widely distributed to include the paranode and even the node (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arroyo et al., 2004</a>), and can act to suppress excitability. Although Kv1.1 and 1.2 expression within the soma is known to be down-regulated following axon transection, and this leads to hyperexcitability at the soma (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rasband et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ishikawa et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Park et al., 2003</a>), the distribution of these channels at the nodal complex and damaged nerve terminal (in the neuroma that forms) has not been examined. Furthermore, little is known regarding the distribution of other members of the shaker type Kv1 channels family such as Kv1.4 and 1.6 following nerve injury."

At day 7 after injury, Kv1.2 channels were not located strictly not\u00a0only\u00a0in the juxtaparanodal regions but also overlapped with paranodal proteins. To objectively measure this, we quantified the distance between the Nav channels staining and the distal end of the caspr staining, and the distance between the Nav channels staining and the proximal end of Kv1 channels. The difference between these two distances was indicative of the level of overlap between Kv1 channels and paranodal proteins (note that \u2018naked\u2019 nodes were not included in the analysis of the spatial distribution of Kv1 channels because by definition these only consist of Nav clusters without paranodal and juxtaparanodal proteins). In na\u00efve axons the distance between Nav channels staining and the end of caspr was 3.8 \u00b1 0.2\u2009\u03bcm, and the distance between Nav channels staining and the start of Kv1.2 staining was 4.2 \u00b1 0.2\u2009\u03bcm, resulting in a relatively small, albeit positive, difference between these distances (0.5 \u00b1 0.08\u2009\u03bcm, n = 4 animals, 25\u201340 nodes per animal), indicating there was no overlap. At day 7 after injury, the distance between Nav channels staining and the end of caspr was 4 \u00b1 0.1\u2009\u03bcm, and the distance between Nav channels staining and the start of Kv1.2 staining was 3.2 \u00b1 0.2\u2009\u03bcm, giving a negative value for the difference between both distances\u00a0(-0.8 \u00b1 0.1\u2009\u03bcm, n = 3 animals, 32\u201335 nodes per animal), which indicates that the Kv1 channels were co-localised with caspr staining and moving closer to the node (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Note that the distance between Nav channels staining and the end of caspr staining remained unchanged after injury, while the distance between Nav channels staining and the start of Kv1.2 staining was significantly reduced. Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (<i>Caspr2</i>) forms a complex with Kv1 channels at the juxtaparanode (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chiu et al., 2014</a>). We evaluated if caspr2 moves closer to the node together with Kv1 channels. We measured the distance between the Nav channels staining and the distal end of the caspr staining, and the distance between the Nav channels staining and the proximal end of caspr2. In na\u00efve axons, the distance between Nav channels staining and the end of caspr was 3.8 \u00b1 0.3\u2009\u03bcm, and the distance between Nav channels staining and the start of caspr2 staining was 4.3 \u00b1 0.0\u2009\u03bcm, resulting in a small difference between these distances (0.49 \u00b1 0.09\u2009\u03bcm, n = 4 animals, 25\u201330 nodes per animal), indicating there was no overlap.

We analysed sciatic nerves from sham-operated and neuroma animals and we observed very few detached or everted loops, with no differences between groups. The close apposition between the axon and the paranodal loop was unchanged as the axo-glial distance was not significantly changed (sham = 9.7 \u00b1 0.4 nm, neuroma = 11.4 \u00b1 0.7 nm, n = 4\u20135 animals per group, 6\u20139 nodes per animal one way ANOVA p\u00a0=\u00a00.08).

The expression of Kv1.4 and 1.6 within the DRG did not significantly change following injury (one Way ANOVA, n\u00a0=\u00a06 per group) suggesting that increased expression within the juxtaparanode and paranode at the neuroma site is a likely consequence of altered trafficking of these proteins rather than global changes in expression."

                                "text": "Spontaneous activity in na\u00efve axons was present in less than 5% of A-fibres (4.5%). We assessed the effect of blocking the Kv1 channels using \u03b1-DTX, a toxin isolated from black and green mamba snakes which is a selective and effective blocker of Kv1-containing oligomers composed of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, or Kv1.6 subunits (<a href=\"#bib23\">Harvey, 2001</a>). We applied the toxin at the neuroma site (or, in control animals, acutely cut sciatic nerve stump) and to the L5 DRG and recorded from sensory axons in thin strands dissected from the dorsal root. In the na\u00efve situation (n\u00a0=\u00a0222 neurons, 10 animals, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>), the incidence of spontaneous activity did not significantly change after \u03b1-DTX (5.4 and 9.8% of myelinated afferents when the toxin was applied to nerve stump or L5 DRG, respectively). Two days after transecting the sciatic nerve (n\u00a0=\u00a0291 neurons, 4 animals), spontaneous activity at the injured nerve increased to 22% of myelinated afferents, and it was similar with or without toxin (toxin applied to neuroma 26.1%, toxin applied to the L5 DRG 26%). However, at 7 days after nerve injury (n\u00a0=\u00a0241 neurons, 7 animals) the proportion of spontaneously active afferents had decreased to 6.2%, and application of the toxin now induced a significant increase in proportion of spontaneously firing myelinated afferents (11.2% toxin at the neuroma p\u00a0=\u00a00.07, and 15.6% toxin to L5 DRG, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002, chi-square test). At day 21 after injury (n\u00a0=\u00a0237 neurons, 7 animals) spontaneous activity has decreased to baseline levels (2.5% of afferents within the dorsal root), but application of the toxin to both neuroma site or L5 DRG significantly increased the proportion of myelinated afferents demonstrating spontaneous activity (7.2% p\u00a0=\u00a00.03 and 17.7 \u00b1% p&lt;0.001 respectively, chi-square test) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9a</a>). In summary, we observed an acute increase in spontaneous activity following nerve injury, which was reversed with time. However, at this later time, blockade of Kv1 channels (which had no effect in the na\u00efve state) could reinstate spontaneous activity almost to levels seen acutely after nerve injury. Therefore, Kv1 channels appear to have a role in the recovery from increased excitability following nerve injury (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9b\u2013d</a>)."

We applied von Frey filaments of increasing forces to the site of the skin covering the neuroma.

Voltage-gated sodium channels are known to accumulate particularly within axon tips and on denuded axons of the neuroma (<a href=\"#bib14\">England et al., 1996</a>). Much less is known regarding the distribution of Kv1 channels changes within the neuroma. This is an important issue as such channels could potentially act as \u2018brakes\u2019 on excitability. At an early time point after injury, we found that Kv1.2 is no longer confined to the juxtaparanode but extended into the paranode. As this could be only a reflection of direct injury, we also looked into a site in the injured nerve 1\u00a0cm proximal to the neuroma and found similar changes in distribution, suggesting this is likely to reflect widespread changes within the axon/axoglial signalling (further supported by changes within the dorsal root and discussed below). At a later time-point following injury, we found a striking reduction in the expression of Kv1.1 and 1.2 which are normally localised to the juxtaparanode. In contrast Kv1.4 and 1.6 which are present at a low level in the na\u00efve state are up-regulated and are present both in the paranode and the juxtaparanode. We found broadly similar changes in rodent and human neuroma. This altered expression and localisation is likely to partially reflect the altered relationship between axons and myelinating Schwann cells. Within the neuroma new nodes of Ranvier will be formed as a consequence of myelination of new axon sprouts and remyelination of denuded axons (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dorsi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dyck et al., 1985</a>). During developmental myelination and remyelination following primary demyelination (in which the axon remains intact) Kv1.1 and 1.2 can at early time points be observed in other regions apart from the juxtaparanode (at the node of Ranvier and the paranode) before being restricted to the juxtaparanode as the nodal complex matures (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rasband et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Vabnick et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Poliak et al., 2001</a>).

We also found striking changes within the nodal complex of sensory axons within the dorsal root. Kv1.2 was no longer down-regulated as had been noted at the neuroma site but its localisation changed following injury: They could be observed in the paranode as well as the juxtaparanode. In the na\u00efve state, very little Kv1.4 and 1.6 expression was noted in the juxtaparanode of the dorsal roots. This is in agreement with previous studies that reported a low frequency of Kv1.4 immunoreactive juxtaparanodes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Everill et al., 1998</a>) and no expression of Kv1.6 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Utsunomiya et al., 2008</a>). We found however that nerve transection led to markedly increased expression of these \u03b1-subunits and they were localised both to juxtaparanode and paranode."

                                "text": "What factors are responsible for the altered distribution of Kv1 channels within the juxtaparanode? We used ultrastructural examination of the juxtaparanode in the dorsal root to examine whether structural changes within the paranode could explain the movement of Kv1 channels into this region (from which they are normally excluded). The transverse bands are important points of attachment between the axon and the paranodal loops of the Schwann cell. These axoglial septate-like junctions are formed by the interaction of caspr (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bhat et al., 2001</a>) and contactin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boyle et al., 2001</a>) on the axolemma binding with the 155Kd isoform of Neurofascin expressed on the Schwann cell paranodal loops (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tait et al., 2000</a>). These junctions act as diffusion barriers between the nodal and juxtaparanodal membrane. Mice lacking caspr (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bhat et al., 2001</a>), contactin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boyle et al., 2001</a>) or NF155 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pillai et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sherman et al., 2005</a>) have absent transverse bands, increased distance between the axon and Schwann cell membrane, disorganisation of the paranodal loops and probably as a consequence of the loss of this lateral diffusion barrier Kv1 channels are noted to extend into the paranode. Similarly in mice lacking ceramide galactosyl transferase in which all-putative adhesion components of the paranodal junction are lacking, Kv1.2 and caspr2 are also mis-localised to the paranodes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Poliak et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">2003</a>). On ultrastructural examination of the paranodes within the sciatic nerve following injury, we did not see major structural changes and there was no increase in the distance between the axon and the Schwann cell membrane at the site of attachment of the paranodal loops. We noted an increase in the maximum distance between paranodal loops, which is unlikely to alter the ability of molecules to passively diffuse between the membrane domains of the juxtaparanode and paranode (however it will increase the diameter of the helical pathway between paranodal loops connecting the extracellular space to the axonal internode. One potential consequence of which would be reduced passive resistance to current flow between the node and voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) in the juxtaparanode and paranode, which could then have a greater influence on nodal excitability (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shroff et al., 2011</a>). A recent publication has demonstrated that in mice lacking \u03b2II spectrin expression in axons Kv1 channels were no longer restricted to the juxtaparanode but could also be observed in the paranode even though the structural integrity of axoglial junctions was intact (<a href=\"#bib68\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). \u03b2II spectrin contributes to the sub-membranous cytoskeleton of the axon-linking membrane proteins to actin and appears to act as a barrier limiting the lateral diffusion of membrane proteins. We found that paranodal expression of \u03b2II spectrin was reduced following axotomy and a reduction in this sub-membranous barrier is compatible with the lateral movement of Kv1 channels into this region that we observed. As well as Kv1 channels we also see caspr2 overlapping with paranodal markers following nerve injury and again such paranodal localisation of caspr2 was also reported in mice in which axonal \u03b2II spectrin is conditionally ablated. Caspr2 complexes with and is important for the correct localisation of Kv1 channels (<a href=\"#bib42\">Poliak et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">2003</a>) suggesting that this whole protein complex is mis-localised following nerve injury. Although loss of a sub-membranous barrier to diffusion of the VGKC-complex is one explanation for their paranodal localisation, we do not yet have a full understanding of the regulation of Kv1 channels trafficking. Phosphorylation events may have a role to play as Kv1.2 can undergo phosphorylation, which impacts on surface expression/localisation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gu and Gu, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2007</a>)."

A recent study showed that myelinated sensory fibres are key in maintaining mechanical allodynia in several neuropathic pain models (<a href=\"#bib64\">Xu et al., 2015</a>). Spontaneous activity and mechanical stimulus evoked activity has been recorded in myelinated afferents innervating neuroma using microneurography (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nystr\u00f6m and Hagbarth, 1981</a>). The role of Kv1 channels has mainly focussed on their importance in suppressing excitability at the soma rather than the axon following injury. The expression of a number of \u03b1 Kv1 channels sub-units has been documented to decrease following peripheral axotomy including Kv1.1, 1.2 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Everill et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ishikawa et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yang et al., 2004</a>) and in some reports Kv1.4 (we did not see a reduction in Kv1.4 using western blot analysis of DRG lysate following sciatic axotomy, however, this is a less proximal lesion compared to spinal nerve ligation [<a href=\"#bib15\">Everill et al., 1998</a>]). Correspondingly, the K currents mediated by such channels are reduced when measured at the soma (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yang et al., 2004</a>) both in small and large diameter DRG cells. The focus has therefore been on the loss of K currents within the soma which normally act as a \u2018break\u2019 on excitability, and combined with increased excitatory drive for instance due to the dysfunction of voltage-gated sodium channels and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels this leads to ectopic activity (<a href=\"#bib62\">Waxman and Zamponi, 2014</a>). While changes at the soma are undoubtedly important, ectopic impulses also arise along the axon. There has been much less focus on the distribution and function of Kv1 channels within the axon following peripheral nerve injury."

                                "text": "The function of Kv1 channels is critically dependent on their targeting to specific neuronal compartments (<a href=\"#bib57\">Trimmer, 2015</a>). The expression of Kv1 channels within the DRG soma and the axon should not be assumed to be the same: For instance the expression of Kv1.6 remains stable within the DRG both at the level of mRNA and protein (see <a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al. (2002)</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">Yang et al. (2004)</a> and our own data) but as we show here expression markedly increases in axons within peripheral nerve and dorsal root. Altered \u03b1 subunit composition and localisation of Kv1 channels is likely to have functional implications. In the na\u00efve state, the Kv1 channels Kv1.1 and 1.2 are located within the juxtaparanode, below the insulating myelin sheath and at least in peripheral nerves have little functional impact on nodal excitability and conduction (<a href=\"#bib44\">Poliak et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chiu and Ritchie, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Sherratt et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rasband et al., 1998</a>). During development when Kv1 channels are observed in the node and paranode using specific blockers of this K current suggests that these Kv1 channels prevent re-entrant excitation in motor axons (<a href=\"#bib59\">Vabnick et al., 1999</a>). Following primary demyelination, the re-distribution of Kv1 channels to the paranode acts to suppress continuous conduction in demyelinated axons (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rasband et al., 1998</a>). In certain contexts therefore and especially when Kv1 channels begin to encroach on the paranodal regions there is evidence that these channels can suppress excitability of the axon. As has been previously demonstrated we have found that the rate of ectopic activity within myelinated axons is very high in the first week and then decreases the longer the time elapsed following the initial injury (<a href=\"#bib7\">Campbell et al., 1988</a>). Understanding adaptive mechanisms to suppress such hyper-excitability will potentially provide insight as to why in certain patients such mechanisms fail leading to chronic pain states. Over a similar time period as this reduction in spontaneous activity we have observed increased expression of Kv1.4 and 1.6 as well as redistribution of Kv1 channels to the paranode and juxtaparanode domains. Selective inhibition of Kv1 channels with \u03b1-DTX reinstates a higher level of ectopic activity, increases mechanosensitivity of afferents innervating the neuroma and on behavioural testing also exacerbates mechanical hypersensitivity, which had begun to normalise at 3 weeks post injury. \u03b1-DTX blocks Kv1.1, Kv1.2 and Kv1.6. As expression of Kv1.1 and 1.2 are decreased while Kv1.6 is increased, most probably the effect seen with the toxin is through Kv1.6. Selective inhibition of Kv1.4 did not recapitulate these events emphasising the role of Kv1.6 (and subunits with which it complexes) in suppressing hyperexcitability. Neuronal Kv1 proteins form heterotetramerization of \u03b1 subunits, which also associate with auxiliary Kv\u03b2 subunits (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jan and Jan, 2012</a>), adding complexity in ascribing function to individual \u03b1 subunits. \u03b1 subunits confer particular pharmacological and biophysical properties on these channels and in addition there may be interactions between subunits. For instance Kv1.4, usually shows N-type rapid inactivation through an N-terminal inactivation ball however this can be over-ridden if associated with a Kv1.6 \u03b1 subunit (<a href=\"#bib48\">Roeper et al., 1998</a>), due to its NIP (N-type inactivation prevention) domain."

Rats were group housed and placed on a 12\u2009hr-light 12\u2009hr-dark cycles. Two different nerve injury models were used: the neuroma model and the L5 spinal nerve transection (SNT) model. The neuroma model of neuropathic pain was based on the TNT model (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dorsi et al., 2008</a>), but performed with some modifications. Briefly, the sciatic nerve was dissected free of adjacent tissue, ligated with a suture, and cut proximal to its bifurcation. The needle from the suture was passed through a subcutaneous tunnel to the lateral aspect of the hindlimb where it was pushed through the skin. The nerve was drawn into the tunnel until the ligature is adjacent to the skin. The suture was cut, and the incision closed. The suture tied to the distal end of the sciatic nerve was visible through the skin and served as the target for mechanical stimuli. An analogous site served as the target on the contralateral hindlimb. For the L5 SNT model (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim and Chung, 1992</a>), one-third of the L6 transverse process was removed and the L5 spinal nerve was identified and dissected free from the adjacent L4 spinal nerve and then tightly ligated using 6\u20130 silk and then transected distally to the suture. Sham-operated animals served as a control. We used these two different models as the neuroma model is the most adequate for performing behavioural tests as the injured nerve can be directly stimulated, while the L5 SNT model has the advantage that it gives certainty that all the dorsal root axons studied had their peripheral terminals injured. For both models animals were deeply anaesthetised with a mix of isofluorane and oxygen. Postoperative analgesia was given for the first 5 days postop (tramadol 50 mg/kg/day p.o). Animals were checked every day after surgery to check for self-mutilation behaviour (autotomy), which prompted us to sacrifice the animal.

Experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by 'Coordinaci\u00f3n de \u00c9tica, Bio\u00e9tica y Seguridad de las investigaciones UC' (experiments done in Chile) and were performed in accordance with the UK Home Office regulations (experiments done in the UK).

For WB of Kv1.1 and for Kv1.2 the membranes were cut in 2 pieces: the top one was probed with either Kv1.1 or Kv1.2 antibody and the bottom one was probed with GAPDH antibody. The 2 or 3 pieces of the membranes were lined up as a single membrane before exposing it to the film so that the molecular weight can be calculated by measuring the running distance of the molecular weight marker and the target bands. This could be done as the bands labelled by the antibodies have quite different molecular weights.

Sections were visualised on a PHILIPS TECNAI 12 BIOTWIN transmission electron microscope at the Unidad de microscopia avanzada, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. We measured the diameter of the axons at the site of the node, the maximal and minimal distance between interloops, the distance between the glia and the axon, the number of detached loops, and the number of everted loops using Image J (NIH, USA) and a 135000x magnification. We quantified between 8 and 14 nodes per animal, and we used 5 animals per condition (sample sizes were calculated using a power of 80% and an \u03b1 error of 0.05%, assuming a change in distance of 50% with a variance of 0.4, which resulted in a sample needed of 4 animals per group, however due to the difficulty in the technique we included one more animals in each group). The investigator was blinded to the treatment group of each specimen, however, this was sometimes difficult to conceal as the anatomy in the injured nerves was much more disrupted than in naive nerves."

A tracheotomy was performed and the L5 dorsal roots and DRGs were exposed via laminectomy. Sciatic nerve neuroma with proximal nerve (5\u20136\u2009mm long) and contralateral uninjured sciatic nerve were exposed. The contralateral sciatic nerve was acutely cut to disconnect from the periphery just before recording. The entire site was covered in agarose gel and four chambers created by removing blocks of this gel. These were 1) neuroma chamber, containing ipsilateral neuroma and part of sciatic nerve which is subjected to stimulation; 2) acutely cut nerve end chamber, containing contralateral sciatic nerve proximal end; 3) DRGs chamber, containing L5 DRGs from both sides; 4) spinal recording chamber, containing part of L5 dorsal roots from both sides near entry zone to spinal cord. The neuroma chamber and nerve cut end chamber were filled with mineral oil during stimulation, and the oil was replaced with \u03b1DTx (100 nM in saline) during toxin application. The DRGs chamber was filled with saline or \u03b1DTx/saline solution, and the recording chamber was always filled with mineral oil. The pool temperatures were not controlled, but as animals were warmed using an infrared lamp from the back, the pool was therefore heated, and typically was at 34\u201335\u00b0C. Just before recording, the L5 dorsal root was cut near entry zone, a filament was teased out and hooked up for recording. Each filament was stimulated electrically with increasing current to recruit sequentially each conducting axon in that filament. The conduction velocity of each conducting axon was noted. Thus, the number of functioning axons in each filament was determined (typically, 6\u201310). Spike discrimination was used to detect the number different axons firing spontaneously in each filament (typically 0\u20133) during a pre-treatment baseline and under 3 different treatment conditions: 1) no \u03b1DTx in any of the chambers; 2) \u03b1DTx in neuroma or nerve cut end chamber; 3) \u03b1DTx in neuroma or nerve cut end chamber and DRGs chambers. The \u03b1DTx was applied for at least 20 min before recording. An independent investigator prepared the drugs individually and labelled them for each animal according to the randomization schedule. Data analysts were blinded as the conditions under which all recording were made."

The total number of conducting axons in each filament was determined by incremental electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve. The percentage of mechanosensitive units was calculated as the number of different neurons responding by firing action potentials upon mechanical stimulation, divided by the number of conducting fibres (which was determined in the same way as for the spontaneous activity experiments). Axonal mechanosensitivity was assessed before and after toxin application at 21 days after axotomy. Mechanosensitivity experiments were carried out on separate animals to spontaneous activity experiments to ensure that any spontaneous activity encountered was not caused acutely by the repeated mechanical stimulation of the neuroma."

Animals were randomised to receive either subcutaneous \u03b1DTX (0.5\u00a0ml at 100 nM in saline, Alomone, UK) or saline (which was administered locally at the site of the neuroma) using a computer-generated random sequence. The sample sizes were calculated using a power of 80% and an \u03b1 error of 0.05%, assuming a 60% decrease in withdrawal threshold with a variance of 25% from the mean, which resulted in a sample needed of 7 animals per group. Experimental groups were the following: baseline with vehicle, baseline with toxin; day 3 after surgery with vehicle, day 3 with toxin; day 7 with vehicle, day 7 with toxin; day 21 with vehicle, day 21 with toxin. To reduce the amount of animals of the study the animals that received saline only were used again for the consecutive time-points. The animals that received toxin had to be sacrificed after testing, as the toxin is irreversible. The toxin or saline were injected 30 min before testing. Autotomy after nerve injury (especially neuroma model) appears at around 10 days after injury. Therefore, we allocated 2 extra animals for the saline group, and 2 extra for toxin day 21. We had to sacrifice 1 animal from the saline group at day 6, and 2 animals from the toxin group day 21 (at day 15 and 17 after injury respectively), due to self-mutilating behaviour. For testing, rats were gently restrained using a towel on a table. Calibrated von Frey hairs were applied to the skin covering the neuroma until the fibre bent. Withdrawal of the limb by the animal was recorded as a response. The 50% withdrawal threshold was determined using the up-down method (Dixon, 1980). An independent investigator prepared the drugs individually and labelled them for each animal according to the randomization schedule. Operators and data analysts were blinded throughout the study.

To answer this question we repeated the experiment (i.e. neuroma at day 7) and collected nerve from the injury site close to neuroma) and from a site 1cm proximal to the injury site (far from neuroma). For Kv1.2 we found that the results were the same when we looked at a site close to the neuroma and at a site far from the neuroma with the movement of Kv1.2 into the paranodal region in both situations. In comparing the neuroma site and 1cm proximal to the neuroma there was no difference in the distance measured from the Nav staining to the end of Caspr staining (p = 0.8), no difference in the distance measured from the Nav staining to the start of Kv1.2 staining (p = 0.9), and in the difference between these measurements (p = 0.6). Regarding caspr2, we also found that it moves to the paranode at both sites, close and far from the neuroma. Comparing these two sites there was no difference in the distance measured from the Nav staining to the end of Caspr staining (p = 0.9), no difference in the distance measured from the Nav staining to the start of caspr2 staining (p=0.1), and no difference (p=0.06) in the difference between these measurements.

We should say, that this staining is extremely difficult to do in human nerves (due to the fact that for instance we have limited control as to the duration of time before the nerve is placed in fix following surgery), and after several optimizing steps this is our best attempt. We added high magnification pictures in the figure to fit the style, but in <a href=\"#fig12\">Author response image 1</a> we show low magnification of the same images (both are in Morton neuroma).

Assuming this is the case, we agree with the reviewer that it is best not to refer to Kv1.2 as a marker of the juxtaparanode. It is the subject of inquiry and is a protein normally localized to the juxtaparanode and it is re-distributed after injury. What we have done is measure the distance between the voltage gated sodium channel accumulation (Nav) and the end of caspr (which we used as a marker of the paranode and importantly this distance doesn\u2019t change with nerve injury). We also measured the distance between Nav and the start of the Kv1 channels. We then obtained the difference between these two distances. If the distance was a positive value it meant that there is a gap, albeit very small, between this paranodal protein and the Kv1 channels. If this distance was a negative value it meant that the Kv1 channels have moved into the paranode and co-localise with caspr (see <a href=\"#fig13\">Author response image 2</a>). We did these same measurements for caspr2 another protein normally localized to the juxtaparanode (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), which is also re-distributed along the Kv1 channels."
