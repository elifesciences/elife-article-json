CAMSAP homologs associate with microtubule minus-ends, and are important for the stability of epithelial cell adhesions. In this study, we report morphological defects in neurons and neuromuscular defects in mutants of the <i>C. elegans</i> CAMSAP, <i>ptrn-1</i>. Mechanosensory neurons initially extend wild-type neurites, and subsequently remodel by overextending neurites and retracting synaptic branches and presynaptic varicosities. This neuronal remodeling can be activated by mutations known to alter microtubules, and depends on a functioning DLK-1 MAP kinase pathway. We found that PTRN-1 localizes to both neurites and synapses, and our results suggest that alterations of microtubule structures caused by loss of PTRN-1 function activates a remodeling program leading to changes in neurite morphology. We propose a model whereby minus-end microtubule stabilization mediated by a functional PTRN-1 is necessary for morphological maintenance of neurons."

Microtubules have a number of important roles inside cells: they are part of the cytoskeleton that provides structural support for the cell; they help to pull chromosomes apart during cell division; and they guide the trafficking of proteins and molecules around inside the cell. Most microtubules are relatively unstable, undergoing continuous dis-assembly and re-assembly in response to the needs of the cell. The microtubules in the branches of nerve cells are an exception, remaining relatively stable over time. Now Marcette et al. and, independently, Richardson et al., have shown that a protein called PTRN-1 has an important role in stabilizing the microtubules in the nerve cells of nematode worms."

Moreover, the mutant worms lost the swellings that are normally found at the junctions between nerve cells, and they also moved their bodies in an odd way."

Marcette et al. suggest that the microtubules become less stable when this protein is not present, and that this switches on a repair mechanism that remodels the nerve cells, providing that the active form of a protein called DLK-1 is present. Other mutations that reduce the stability of microtubules also triggered the same remodeling process. Future work will be necessary to uncover exactly what triggers the remodeling process, and to identify the other proteins that are involved in repairing the nerve cells."

The conserved mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase DLK-1 functions to transmit regenerative signals in <i>C. elegans</i>, and is a component of regenerative signaling in organisms with more complex nervous systems (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hammarlund et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Xiong et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Shin et al., 2012</a>). While there is a wealth of information about conserved down-stream signals affected by DLK-1 activity, very little information exits about how DLK-1 itself is activated (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tedeschi and Bradke, 2013</a>). Recently, calcium spikes were shown to activate <i>C. elegans</i> DLK-1, but fly and mammalian homologs lack this calcium-binding domain (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yan and Jin, 2012</a>). It is known that the conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 (PHR, PAM, HIGHWIRE) keeps levels of DLK-1 low (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nakata et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Xiong et al., 2010</a>). Axonal injury is reported to cause microtubule disassembly and disorganization of higher-order microtubule structures (<a href=\"#bib16\">Erturk et al., 2007</a>). Microtubule depolymerization was recently found to activate DLK-1 signaling. However, this study did not investigate in what context (development, regeneration, or degeneration) this microtubule-based mechanism might be functioning (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bounoutas et al., 2011</a>)."

Proteins known to be involved in stabilizing and organizing microtubule structures include molecular motors, and cross-linkers, as well as microtubule nucleating and severing proteins, and proteins involved in regulating plus-end dynamics (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib57\">Subramanian and Kapoor, 2012</a>). Post-translational modifications to microtubules include acetylation, tyrosination, glutamylation, glycylation, and phosphorylation. These modifications affect the recruitment of microtubule-associated proteins and denote subcellular populations of microtubule structures such as the tyrosinated microtubules of dynamic growth cones or the acetylated microtubules of stable neurites (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baas and Black, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brown et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Janke and Bulinski, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Garnham and Roll-Mecak, 2012</a>).

Furthermore, microtubule de-acetylation was recently shown to be an early signal for the development of growth-cones in neuronal remodeling associated with regeneration (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cho and Cavalli, 2012</a>). It is currently unclear how destabilizing modifications or depolymerization of microtubule structures could activate neuronal remodeling. Depolymerization events that occur in dynamic microtubule populations clearly do not cause neurite remodeling in healthy neurons, so it is not likely that depolymerization itself or free microtubule monomers are the remodeling signal."

These remodeling events require DLK-1, a known player in morphology changes associated with degenerative and regenerative signaling in neurons. This is the first report of a CAMSAP family member being involved in remodeling of neurite morphology. Members of the CAMSAP family are known to associate with microtubule minus ends and stabilize microtubule structures (<a href=\"#bib24\">Goshima et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Meng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baines et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tanaka et al., 2012</a>).

We were able to mimic and enhance <i>ptrn-1</i> loss-of-function phenotypes with genetic and pharmacological alterations of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Furthermore, mutation of <i>dlk-1</i> suppressed a microtubule acetylation mutant supporting the idea that altering microtubule structures is an upstream signal for DLK-1 activation. PTRN-1 is present in neurites and at sites of synaptic connectivity, suggesting local microtubule minus-end regulation may affect these mechanisms. In addition to identifying a novel function for CAMSAPs in the maintenance of neuron morphology, our results suggest that alterations to microtubule structures caused by loss of CAMSAP function activates a neuronal remodeling program. We propose a model whereby local minus-end microtubule stabilization mediated by CAMSAPs is necessary for the stabilization of mature neurite morphology."

Although ALM neurites extend during embryonic development, the development of PLM neurons occurs in several distinct steps some of which occur during the L1 larval stage (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). After extending lateral neurites in the embryo, PLMs form collateral branches early in the L1 larval stage, and subsequently active zone synaptic machinery, vesicles, and mitochondria are recruited successively to nascent collateral presynaptic varicosities. The overall morphological pattern is maintained as the animal quadruples its body length from the L1 to L4 larval stage, with the only substantive change being a ten-fold increase in the size of presynaptic varicosity. In <i>ptrn-1</i> animals, we noticed that wild-type morphology is lost after the initial L1 patterning, with animals missing presynaptic varicosities and overextending neurites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). A small fraction of <i>ptrn-1</i> animals had overextended neurites and/or missing presynaptic varicosities at the L1 stage (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>); however from this data set, we are unable to determine if these animals originally formed morphologically normal neurites and experienced early retraction/overextension defects prior to the L1 time-point or if they represent a partially penetrant role for <i>ptrn-1</i> in initial L1 patterning. We also examined individual animals at both the L1 and L4 larval stages to confirm that aberrant morphology phenotypes do occur subsequent to L1 developmental patterning (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Ectopic presynaptic varicosities that formed at the terminus of overextended neurites in L1 larva were also subject to retracting; further supporting the idea that <i>ptrn-1</i> is required for maintenance, rather than initial establishment of neurite morphology."

We favor a model where perturbations of the microtubule cytoskeleton are responsible for activation of remodeling in <i>ptrn-1</i> mutants. Interestingly, recent findings indicate that at cooler temperatures, neuronal microtubules incorporate microtubule monomers that have been stabilized through post-translational modification (<a href=\"#bib56\">Song et al., 2013</a>).

One possibility is that CAMSAPs are involved in microtubule-based sequestration of a RPM-1 inhibitor. RPM-1 is known to keep levels of DLK-1 low by targeting it for degradation, and this mechanism must be surmounted in <i>ptrn-1</i> mutants that have a functional <i>rpm-1</i> gene. Alternatively, if DLK-1 or a DLK-1 activator is being sequestered, then perhaps a build-up of these stores over time overwhelms the ability of RPM-1 to keep DLK-1 levels low."

These higher-order cytoskeletal networks must be organized in a way that stabilizes microtubule minus ends, in addition to linking individual microtubules together. The minus-end of microtubules are both known for durability and are distributed at regular intervals throughout neurites (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baas and Black, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kurachi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cueva et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bellanger et al., 2012</a>). We found PTRN-1 to be distributed in puncta along neurites, and these structures thus represent a potential reservoir for sensors that promote remodeling. Although these results indicate that neuronal CAMSAPs function similarly to epithelial CAMSAPs by stabilizing microtubule networks, additional work will be required to explore the link between <i>ptrn-1</i> disruption and specific changes to microtubule-based structures."

The appearance of ALM posterior neurites, seen in <i>ptrn-1</i> mutants, is thought to be a neuron polarity defect (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hilliard and Bargmann, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kirszenblat et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Prasad and Clark, 2006</a>), and the cell body puncta seen in animals expressing PTRN-1:mcherry may be microtubule organizing centers necessary for polarized neurite outgrowth. However, the composition of ectopic ALM posterior neurites is incompletely understood. These extensions are reported to occur due to hyper-stabilization of microtubules (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kirszenblat et al., 2013</a>), but also appear in mutants where microtubules and cytoskeletal networks are disrupted (<a href=\"#bib60\">Topalidou et al., 2012</a>). Mature neurons are known to have stable microtubule structures due to post-translational modifications and interactions with cytoskeletal associated proteins (<a href=\"#bib12\">Conde and Caceres, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kawataki et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Song et al., 2013</a>). The differential effects of colchicine that we see on ALM and PLM phenotypes in <i>ptrn-1</i> mutants may occur because of the differences in microtubule-based structures present in ectopic (ALM) vs native (PLM) neurites. Future work will be necessary to probe the role of CAMSAPs in neuron polarity."

We speculate that without the stabilizing function of CAMSAP proteins, neuronal remodeling may be more likely to occur, a phenomenon we observed in <i>C. elegans ptrn-1</i> mutants.

When we submitted in November, Wormbase showed 3 isoforms (1 of which was purely computational and erroneous, and a second that was based on an unreliable compound EST). On Jan 13, 2014, the Wormbase annotation is different and now includes both <i>ptrn-1</i> isoforms we have documented, but still includes two questionable isoforms. We have made Wormbase aware of the errors and now provide the sequence of the two isoforms as supplemental data. We would be happy to submit these to Genbank if <i>eLife</i> requests, but given the RNA-seq data in Wormbase, these forms can be deduced easily from RNA-seq and EST data."
