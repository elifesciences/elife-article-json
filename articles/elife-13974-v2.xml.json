This genetic diversity has long been known to facilitate adaptation, but recent studies have suggested that cooperation between variants might also increase population fitness. Here, we demonstrate strong cooperation between two H3N2 influenza variants that differ by a single mutation at residue 151 in neuraminidase, which normally mediates viral exit from host cells. Residue 151 is often annotated as an ambiguous amino acid in sequenced isolates, indicating mixed viral populations. We show that mixed populations grow better than either variant alone in cell culture. Pure populations of either variant generate the other through mutation and then stably maintain a mix of the two genotypes. We suggest that cooperation arises because mixed populations combine one variant\u2019s proficiency at cell entry with the other\u2019s proficiency at cell exit. Our work demonstrates a specific cooperative interaction between defined variants in a viral quasispecies."

This genetic diversity has long been known to facilitate adaptation, but recent studies have suggested that cooperation between variants might also increase population fitness. Here, we demonstrate strong cooperation between two H3N2 influenza variants that differ by a single mutation at residue 151 in neuraminidase, which normally mediates viral exit from host cells. Residue 151 is often annotated as an ambiguous amino acid in sequenced isolates, indicating mixed viral populations. We show that mixed populations grow better than either variant alone in cell culture. Pure populations of either variant generate the other through mutation and then stably maintain a mix of the two genotypes. We suggest that cooperation arises because mixed populations combine one variant\u2019s proficiency at cell entry with the other\u2019s proficiency at cell exit. Our work demonstrates a specific cooperative interaction between defined variants in a viral quasispecies."

Both variants are reported numerous times in human H3N2 NA sequences deposited in the GISAID EpiFlu database, and both have been observed in mixed populations when clinical specimens are passaged in cell culture. We show that the two variants grow better together than apart, and that serial passage repeatably selects for mixed populations. We suggest that the cooperation arises because one variant is proficient at cell entry while the other is proficient at cell exit. Overall, our work represents a clear example of selection to generate and maintain two cooperating genotypes within a viral quasispecies."

Residue 151 is in the NA active site and is highly conserved; until recently, it had an amino-acid identity of D in virtually all N2 NAs. Ordinarily, NA mediates viral exit from the host cell by cleaving sialic-acid receptors to release newly produced virions. The D151G mutation ablates the catalytic activity of NA and instead causes it to bind the receptors that it typically cleaves (<a href=\"#bib38\">Zhu et al., 2012</a>).

Most isolates in this database are first passaged in eggs or cell culture, and then the consensus sequence of the viral population is determined by Sanger sequencing. Beginning in 2007, the frequency of mutations at NA site 151 rose dramatically, with mutant genotypes representing about a quarter of the sequences. G151 and N151 are each reported in about 1% of sequences, but ambiguous nucleotide calls at the codon make up the majority of non-wild-type sequences. Because these sequences usually represent consensus calls from Sanger sequencing, the ambiguous nucleotides likely indicate the presence of mixed D151+G151 and D151+N151 populations. The relative abundance of mixed populations in strains deposited in the GISAID EpiFlu database is consistent with the fact that, in tissue culture, mutations at site 151 arise frequently but fix rarely (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Okomo-Adhiambo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Tamura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Mishin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mohr et al., 2015</a>)."

To understand how variation at site 151 might depend on the passaging procedures, we classified sequences according to their passage histories as annotated in the GISAID EpiFlu database. Prior to 2007, site 151 is almost always reported to be D, regardless of passage history (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). From 2007 onward, variants at site 151 are reported almost exclusively in isolates that have been passaged in cell culture (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Whereas nearly a third of isolates that have been passaged in cell culture are reported to have an amino acid other than D at site 151, only two of nearly 1800 unpassaged isolates and five of nearly 400 egg-passaged isolates are reported to have non-D amino acids at site 151. These observations accord with reports in the literature that mutations at site 151 are observed primarily in cell-culture-passaged isolates (<a href=\"#bib33\">Tamura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mohr et al., 2015</a>). However, it is important to remember that the methods used to determine most sequences in the GISAID EpiFlu database lack sensitivity to detect minority variants in a viral population. For instance, the experimental results that we describe below suggest that it is exceedingly unlikely that any of the more than 100 reported G151 sequences actually reflect the complete fixation of this mutation."

Its NA protein sequence is identical to that of several other sequenced isolates, except that the other strains have D at site 151. We created reverse-genetics plasmids encoding the protein sequences of both the D151 and G151 variants of the Hanoi/2007 NA, as well as the HA from this strain. The internal genes were derived from the lab-adapted A/WSN/33 influenza strain with GFP packaged in the PB1 segment (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bloom et al., 2010</a>).

These variants differ by a single amino-acid mutation in NA, and each variant is present in many human H3N2 isolates that have been analyzed by Sanger sequencing after passage in the lab. Prior work has assumed that the less common G151 variant is a lab-adaptation mutant that emerges as the more common D151 variant is passaged in cell culture. Our work shows, however, that evolution in cell culture selects for a balanced mix of both variants. The G151 variant can barely replicate alone, but it cooperates with the D151 variant to increase population fitness. After multiple serial passages, both pure and mixed populations converge to an equilibrium in which both variants are present at approximately equal frequencies. Our work therefore represents a clear example of cooperation between distinct variants in a viral quasispecies."

However, the HAs of recent human H3N2 strains have reduced affinity for many sialic-acid receptors (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gulati et al., 2013</a>), reducing the efficiency with which those viruses can attach to many cells via HA. G151 viruses are proficient at cell entry, since their NA binds strongly to sialic acid, but they cannot detach effectively from host cells due to a lack of catalytic activity (<a href=\"#bib38\">Zhu et al., 2012</a>). But in combination, D151 and G151 enable both efficient cell exit and entry. Indeed, our experiments with a binding-deficient HA indicate that in a mixed D151 and G151 population, NA can act as the exclusive source of both receptor binding and receptor cleaving (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Our results evoke prior work showing that fitness in a Coxsackie virus population is enhanced by the combination of multiple receptor-binding variants (<a href=\"#bib5\">Border\u00eda et al., 2015</a>)."

Co-infection of the same cell with both D151 and G151 variants would produce progeny that have both NA variants on their surface, even though each new virion would package only a single copy of the NA gene. We suspect that much of the observed cooperation may result from co-infections that produce such mixed-NA virions, which would then carry proteins that make them proficient at both cell entry and cell exit. We found that MOI affects cooperative dynamics, supporting this interpretation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). However, other mechanisms could also contribute. In a mixed population, D151 viruses may cleave G151 viruses from the cell surface without both protein variants being present on the same infectious particle, since sialidase activity can promote viral growth in <i>trans</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu and Air, 1993</a>). More detailed molecular characterization of virions in mixed populations will be necessary to establish the exact mechanism of cooperation."

Our work emphasizes that genetic diversity in viral populations can be more than a transient state that facilitates adaptation: it can itself be a beneficial trait that is generated and maintained by selection. As the deep sequencing of viruses becomes increasingly common in microbiology and epidemiology, it will be important to better understand the broader role that cooperation plays in the evolution and maintenance of population-level diversity."

We measured the growth of mixed and pure viral populations at an MOI of 0.02, and we serially passaged replicate pure and mixed populations at the same MOI. As the reviewers may have suspected, we find that at low MOI there is initially a lag period where the mixed population grows slightly worse than the pure D151 population. But by later times, we find that mixed populations grow better than pure populations even at an MOI of 0.02. We proposed that cooperation occurs when the D151 and G151 viruses co-infect the same cell, which would occur less frequently during the initial stages of a lower MOI infection. In accordance with these predictions, we see that the mixed populations grow slightly worse than the pure populations during the first 24 hours of the passage, when the MOI is low. Later in the passage, when the MOI increases due to accumulation of virus in the supernatant, we find that the mixed populations grow better than the pure populations. These new data are what in now is <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> of the revised paper."

For instance, a number of Sanger sequencing studies report G151 as \u201cfixed\u201d in cell culture passaged virus \u2013 something that appears very unlikely in light of our experimental results. It therefore remains unclear of G151 arises fully de novo in cell culture, or is simply enriched from pre-existing variation."

However, this work requires access to clinical samples that place it outside the scope of our current study. In any case, we note that the identification of viral cooperation even in cell culture is a finding of significant evolutionary interest \u2013 particularly since it arises so repeatedly and consistently. As is often the case in biology, we hope that our characterization of this fascinating phenomenon in the lab will provide a scientific motivation for further studies that examine if the same principles apply in other settings."
