Chronic activation of P2X7 underlies many health problems such as pathologic pain, yet we lack effective antagonists due to poorly understood mechanisms of inhibition. Here we present crystal structures of a mammalian P2X7 receptor complexed with five structurally-unrelated antagonists. Unexpectedly, these drugs all bind to an allosteric site distinct from the ATP-binding pocket in a groove formed between two neighboring subunits. This novel drug-binding pocket accommodates a diversity of small molecules mainly through hydrophobic interactions. Functional assays propose that these compounds allosterically prevent narrowing of the drug-binding pocket and the turret-like architecture during channel opening, which is consistent with a site of action distal to the ATP-binding pocket. These novel mechanistic insights will facilitate the development of P2X7-specific drugs for treating human diseases."

While some patients are responsive to commonly used analgesics, many are resistant to treatment (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dworkin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Finnerup et al., 2010</a>). The P2X7 receptor, an extracellular ATP-gated ion channel predominantly expressed in immune cells of the blood and the brain (<a href=\"#bib43\">Surprenant et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Habermacher et al., 2016</a>), is an emerging target for treating refractory pain (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chessell et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gum et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Burnstock, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">North and Jarvis, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sperl\u00e1gh and Illes, 2014</a>). Over the last decade, enormous effort has been made to develop a number of structurally distinct P2X7 specific antagonists, some of which have been demonstrated to alleviate chronic pain in animal models (<a href=\"#bib22\">Honore et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">McGaraughty et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bartlett et al., 2014</a>). However, mechanisms of action for these drugs remain poorly understood, hampering the development of effective therapeutic compounds for human patients (<a href=\"#bib29\">Keystone et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Stock et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bhattacharya and Biber, 2016</a>)."

The P2X7 receptor belongs to the P2X receptor family, however, it was originally identified as a unique ATP-receptor named \"the P2Z receptor\", as it harbors many characteristics distinct from P2X and P2Y receptors (<a href=\"#bib10\">Di Virgilio, 1995</a>). For instance, the P2X7 receptor requires an unusually high concentration of ATP (EC50\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 mM under physiological ion concentrations) for initial activation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yan et al., 2010</a>), its channel activity is facilitated by prolonged or repeated ATP applications (<a href=\"#bib43\">Surprenant et al., 1996</a>), and it opens a membrane pore large enough for molecules up to\u00a0~900 Da to permeate (<a href=\"#bib41\">Steinberg et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Nuttle and Dubyak, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Yan et al., 2008</a>). While crystal structures of the P2X3 and P2X4 receptors have uncovered common mechanisms such as ATP-binding and gating for the P2X receptor family (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kawate et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hattori and Gouaux, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mansoor et al., 2016</a>), many questions continue to exist regarding subtype specific mechanisms, especially for the enigmatic P2X7 receptor subtype. How do structurally-unrelated drugs antagonize only the P2X7 receptor but not the other P2X subtypes? Do they target an activation mechanism unique to the P2X7 subtype? Here we identified and mapped the binding site for the P2X7 specific inhibitors for the first time using X-ray crystallography, and demonstrated by electrophysiological experiments that those inhibitors allosterically abrogate conformational changes associated with P2X7 receptor activation."

Using fluorescence detection size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kawate and Gouaux, 2006</a>), we screened full-length and a series of C-terminally truncated versions of nine human P2X7 (hP2X7) orthologues (72\u201389% identical), and found that an artificially truncated version of the panda (<i>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</i>) P2X7 receptor (pdP2X7) not only expressed better than other orthologues in insect cells but also remained trimeric and monodisperse in detergents commonly used for crystallography (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Whole cell patch clamp recordings confirmed that pdP2X7 presents comparable characteristics to hP2X7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013G</a>). The truncated pdP2X7 was further optimized to obtain a construct termed pdP2X7cryst(\u03941-21/\u0394360-600/N241S/N284S/V35A/R125A/E174K) that we used to solve the crystal structures at\u00a0~3.5 \u00c5 resolution. pdP2X7<sub>cryst</sub> exhibited slower deactivation and no obvious current facilitation (run-up) after repeated ATP applications (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and F</a>)."

The\u00a0structural resemblance of the transmembrane helices between our current P2X7 and the zfP2X4 in the closed state (root-mean-square displacement (RMSD) of the protomers is 2.8 \u00c5) also supports that our apo-structure represents a closed conformation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

This drug-binding pocket is surrounded by thirteen residues projecting mainly from \u03b2-strands (\u03b24, \u03b213 and \u03b214) in the upper body domains of the neighboring subunits (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). While the precise distances and angles between the side-chains and the drugs cannot be determined at the current resolutions (~3.2\u20133.6 \u00c5), electron density was clear enough to localize and orient the side chains of the drug-coordinating residues (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video\u00a01</a>). Drug binding seems to be mediated mainly by hydrophobic interactions, especially at positions deep within the cavity, involving F95, F103, M105, F293, and V312. Despite structural diversity, all five P2X7 antagonists fit within the drug-binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), highlighting that the size and the shape of the drug-binding pocket play major roles in determining the affinity and specificity of the drugs. Indeed, the equivalent pocket in the P2X4 receptor is too narrow to accommodate the smallest P2X7 antagonist, A804598, even though it is similarly hydrophobic to that of the P2X7 receptor (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">3</a>). Thus, we suggest that the differences in the size of the inter-subunit hydrophobic pocket is the major factor that confers P2X7 specific binding of the inhibitors."

We used BzATP\u2014an artificial but potent agonist of P2X7 receptors\u2014for these experiments to achieve saturating responses in the presence of concentrated antagonist. For each drug, dose response curves fit well with a non-competitive inhibition model (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kenakin, 2006</a>), but poorly with a competitive model (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>).

At this concentration, Alexa-ATP gave rise to fluorescence anisotropy when incubated with P2X7 in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6D</a>). Notably, drug-treated P2X7 receptor exhibited similar levels of fluorescence anisotropy, which drastically decreased in the presence of unlabeled-ATP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6E</a>).

Interestingly, the inter-subunit cavity formed by \u03b213 and \u03b214 in the upper body domain is much wider in P2X7 than in zfP2X4 or in hP2X3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mansoor et al., 2016</a>). Furthermore, this 'turret-like' structure and the cleft corresponding to the P2X7 drug-binding pocket remain relatively occluded in zfP2X4 and in hP2X3 after activation by ATP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mansoor et al., 2016</a>). Do the drug-binding pocket and the turret in P2X7 become narrower during channel activation? To explore the involvement of the inter-subunit cavity in P2X7 receptor activation, we monitored the\u00a0movement of the cavity residues with and without ATP. We first created a series of single cysteine mutants in the drug-binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) and measured ATP-gated channel activity after applying a large cysteine-reactive agent (MTS-TPAE; Mw: 447 Da). We reasoned that modification of a cysteine residue with a bulky moiety should interfere with the conformational changes necessary for channel opening, thereby resulting in diminished channel activity. When MTS-TPAE was applied in the absence of ATP, four cysteine mutants (F103C, K110C, T308C, and I310C) showed irreversible current reduction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and F</a>), consistent with the idea that the covalently bound MTS-TPAE at these positions hinders the conformational changes required for channel opening. When MTS-TPAE was applied in the presence of ATP, on the other hand, none of the cysteine mutants presented significant current reduction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and F</a>). These results indicate that at least four residues in the drug-binding pocket are more accessible to MTS-TPAE in the closed state than in the open state. Our data therefore suggest that the drug-binding pocket narrows upon ATP binding and that such a conformational rearrangement is crucial for P2X7 channel opening."

Because two of the three introduced cysteines may form a disulfide bond, we pretreated the cells with a reducing agent prior to cysteine accessibility experiments. Under these conditions, MTS-TPAE diminished the Y295C channel activity by\u00a0~80% in the absence of ATP but to a lesser extent (~40%) in the presence of ATP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and C</a>). These data support that the turret also narrows during P2X7 activation. Widening of the turret upon ATP-binding is unlikely, as 1) MTS-TPAE had no effect on the Y295C mutant prior to treatment with a reducing agent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), indicating the\u00a0formation of a disulfide bond that would bring the two neighboring subunits closer (C\u03b2-C\u03b2 distance would change from\u00a0~14 \u00c5 to\u00a0~4 \u00c5) and 2) Y295C mutant exhibited comparable current density with the wildtype in the absence of a reducing agent (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Notably, narrowing of the inter-subunit space seems unique to the P2X7 receptor, as suggested by the crystal structures of P2X3 and P2X4 solved in the presence of ATP. Indeed, MTS-TPAE application either in the presence or absence of ATP did not exhibit current reduction for cysteine mutants of the counterpart residues in the P2X4 receptor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>)."

Consistent with the activation mechanisms proposed for P2X3 and P2X4, ATP-binding brings the dorsal fin domain towards the head domain and pushes the left flipper domain away from the ATP-binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). These movements are coupled with widening of the lower body domain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), though to an extent in which the transmembrane helices remain closed. In contrast, little conformational change was observed for the upper body domain including the turret and the drug-binding pockets (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), supporting that the turret closure is essential for P2X7 channel opening. Altogether, our data suggest that P2X7 receptors undergo unique conformational rearrangements where both the drug-binding pocket and the turret in the P2X7 receptor narrow upon ATP-binding. Because such conformational changes are required for channel opening, binding of the P2X7 antagonists preclude these constrictions, thereby efficiently blocking receptor activation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>)."

Our data suggest that this cavity shrinks during activation, which allows the lower body domain to widen further. Indeed, the ATP-binding left flipper domain is connected with the pore-lining transmembrane helix through the turret composed of two \u03b2-strands (\u03b213 and \u03b214), which supports that movements of the upper body domain are tightly coupled with the channel opening (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Although the lower body domain in our ATP/A804598-bound structure does seem to widen to some extent upon ATP-binding, the turret diameter remains locked due to A804598 binding, rendering the accompanying movement of the pore-lining transmembrane helices insufficient for channel opening (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Closure of the turret, therefore, seems to be a prerequisite for full-widening of the lower body domain, which is necessary for channel opening. Interestingly, the turrets of both P2X3 and P2X4 are narrower even in the closed state, which may facilitate subsequent conformational changes in the lower body domain. Obviously, the crystal structure of an ATP-bound, open-state P2X7 would strengthen our hypothesis. However, it is technically challenging to obtain such a crystal structure, as ATP-bound P2X7 receptors are prone to aggregation in a detergent containing solution. Future efforts to uncover molecular details about the open state of P2X7 may yield further insight into subtype-specific activation mechanism."

This discrepancy may be attributed to the high agonist concentrations (i.e. up to 3 mM ATP or 1 mM BzATP) required for obtaining reliable EC50 values in the presence of antagonists. With such a high concentration of agonists, we noticed that the\u00a0YO-PRO-1 uptake activity starts to decline\u00a0~10 min after agonist application. To minimize potential experimental artifacts, we took advantage of the initial rates instead of total counts at a certain time point used by the previous studies. Nevertheless, the Schild plots of these three compounds appear to be linear at lower concentrations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), making it difficult to rely solely on the Schild regression analysis for determining the mode of drug action. We therefore provided extra evidence of non-competitive allosteric drug action using 1) curve fitting with known models of competitive and non-competitive inhibition, 2) ligand-binding assays in the presence of antagonists, and 3) the crystal structure of P2X7 obtained in the presence of both an agonist and an antagonist."

                        "text": "Combined with the crystal structures, information about the drug-receptor specific interactions provide an excellent platform for rationally improving physicochemical properties of currently available P2X7 antagonists. For example, replacing the phenyl group in JNJ47965567 with a slightly bulkier group may increase the binding affinity of this compound, as that would fill the void around residue F95. Likewise, low potency of AZ10606120 and GW791343 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) may be overcome by replacing chemical moieties with those fit better into the drug-binding pocket. Our data also suggest that it may be possible to attach an extra chemical group to the site away from the residue interacting with F103 without affecting binding of the P2X7 antagonists. This leads to an interesting possibility that these drugs could be conjugated with cell penetrating peptides or specific ligands expressed on endothelial cells, which may improve the delivery of drugs across the blood-brain barrier (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen and Liu, 2012</a>). In addition, identification of an unexpected binding pocket within P2X7, that is absent in the closely related P2X4, should allow for engineering of isoform-specific drugs. Development of a new generation of P2X7 antagonists with increased clinical efficacy has the potential to have a significant impact on the treatment of chronic pain and inflammation."

These P2X7 constructs were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and screened using the FSEC strategy (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kawate and Gouaux, 2006</a>). Briefly, Sf9 cells at a cell density of 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in six well plates were infected with 20 \u03bcl/well of P1 virus (10<sup>6</sup>\u201310<sup>7</sup> PFU/mL), harvested after 48 hr, and solubilized in 150 \u03bcl of S1 buffer (1% n-Dodecyl-\u03b2-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM; Anatrace,\u00a0Maumee, OH) and Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in phosphate-buffered saline; (pH 7.4)) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The soluble fractions were collected by ultra-centrifugation at 87,000 \u00d7\u00a0g for 30 min and analyzed by FSEC. Because the full-length P2X7 receptors were poorly expressed in Sf9 cells and did not crystallize in our initial trials, C-terminally truncated versions of the nine P2X7 receptor orthologues (~240 residues removed from the C-terminus) were rescreened by FSEC. Based on the sharp and symmetrical peak profile, the C-terminally truncated panda P2X7 (pdP2X7) was selected for crystallization trials. A series of terminal deletions and glycosylation mutants of pdP2X7 were screened for improving the expression level, stability, and monodispersity. The best behaved construct (\u03941-21/\u0394360-600/N241S/N284S) formed crystals in the P4<sub>2</sub> space group that diffracted to\u00a0~7 \u00c5, which was sufficient for obtaining an initial electron density map by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of the zebrafish P2X4. To improve crystal packing, we screened combinations of point mutants at the predicted crystal contact sites for crystallization/diffraction behavior. Finally, we obtained a construct termed pdP2X7<sub>cryst</sub> (\u03941-21/\u0394360-600/N241S/N284S/V35A/R125A/E174K), which formed crystals in a different space group (I2<sub>1</sub>3) that diffracted to\u00a0~3.5 \u00c5."

HEK293 cells were split into six well plates at a cell density of 2.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> cells/well and incubated overnight. Three hours after transfection with 2 \u03bcg of the full length pdP2X7 in pIM2 vector (IRES-mCherry; modified from pIE2 vector) using jetPRIME reagent (Polyplus-transfection, France), cells were trypsinized, transferred into poly-D-Lysine coated black-walled 96 well plates (Corning,\u00a0Corning,\u00a0NY) at 7.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup> cells/well, and incubated for 24 hr.

Upon application of 1 mM ATP (final), uptake of YO-PRO-1 was recorded with 1 min intervals by following the fluorescence change using a Synergy HT multi-detection microplate reader (Bio-Tek,\u00a0Winooski, VT; Ex: 485 nm/20, Em:528 nm/20, sensitivity 60). To obtain the dose dependent uptake inhibition by antagonists, the initial rates of YO-PRO-1 uptake were plotted against multiple concentrations of the P2X7 specific drugs. The inhibition curves from five independent measurements were fitted to the Hill equation using Origin software (Originlab,\u00a0Northampton, MA) to determine the IC<sub>50</sub> values."

                                "text": "HEK293 cells were split onto glass coverslips in six well plates at 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup> cells/well and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. Cells were transfected with 1 \u03bcg of the full length pdP2X7 (wildtype or mutants) or the full length mP2X4 (wildtype or mutants) in pIE2 vector using FuGENE6 (Promega,\u00a0Madison, WI). Cells were used 18\u201332 hr after transfection for measuring the P2X receptor activities using the whole cell patch clamp configuration. Membrane voltage was clamped at \u221260 mV with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), currents were filtered at 2 kHz (eight-pole Bessel; model 900BT; Frequency Devices,\u00a0Ottawa, IL) and sampled at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1440A and pCLAMP 10.5 software (Molecular Devices). The extracellular solution contained 147 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 13 mM Glucose, 2 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, (pH 7.3). The pipette solution contained 147 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, which was adjusted to pH 7.0 using NaOH. Whole cell configuration was made in an extracellular solution supplemented with 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and the extracellular solutions were rapidly exchanged to the solutions containing desired concentrations of ATP using a computer-controlled perfusion system (RSC-200; Bio-Logic,\u00a0France). Because pdP2X7 substantially runs up (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B and E</a>), we measured the channel activity after treating the cells with 1 mM ATP for at least 20 s. For testing the effects of P2X7 specific antagonists on pdP2X7, these drugs were incubated with ATP (1 mM) for 1 min. Concentrations of the drugs were: A740003: 600 nM; A804598: 180 nM; AZ10606120: 2.3 \u03bcM; GW791343: 50 \u03bcM; JNJ47965567: 136 nM. For the cysteine accessibility studies on pdP2X7, 0.1 mM MTS-TPAE (Toronto Research Chemicals, Canada) was perfused for 10 s either in the absence or presence of 1 mM ATP. For probing mP2X4 accessibility in the closed state, 0.1 mM MTS-TPAE was applied for 10 s and application of 10 \u03bcM ATP for 1 s was used to measure channel activity. For mP2X4 accessibility in the open state, 5 \u03bcM ATP was applied for 9 s and 0.1 mM MTS-TPAE was applied for 3 s. For measuring cysteine accessibility of pdP2X7/Y295C or mP2X4/F296C mutants, cells were treated with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 5 min prior to recording. To normalize the channel activities from multiple experiments, the ratio between channel activity before and after MTS-TPAE application was calculated for each cell. Since mP2X4 rapidly runs down, these ratios were further normalized to the control channel activities measured on the same cell in the absence of MTS-TPAE. Stock solutions of 100 mM MTS-TPAE were prepared freshly every 5 hr in water and stored on ice and were diluted to the desired concentrations in the extracellular solution immediately before each recording. All recordings were performed using more than five cells."

Structures were solved in the presence of 5 distinct inhibitors, and for one of them in the combined presence of ATP. These structures show that the drugs bind in a completely unanticipated region of the receptor, in a cleft originating from the external surface of the receptor that resides behind the ATP binding pocket. In the one case when ATP was bound to the receptor along with antagonist, closure of the lateral ATP binding domain occurs similar to what is seen in the original structure of the ATP-bound zfP2X4 receptor, as well as the very recently published ATP-bound P2X3 receptor, but opening the pore is prevented by the presence of the drugs in the cleft, suggesting that it narrows as the channel opens. Interestingly, the drug-binding cleft is essentially absent from P2X3 and 4 receptors, explaining why the drugs studied here are selective for P2X7. The new structures presented are accompanied by extensive functional experiments, including 1) mutagenesis of the drug-binding cleft to confirm the unexpected binding site, 2) Schild analysis demonstrating that the drugs do not work through a competitive mechanism as suggested for 3 of the compounds by earlier work, and 3) accessibility studies with bulky MTS reagents that are consistent with the cleft being wide in the closed state and narrowing upon ATP binding. Overall this is a beautiful study that arrives at interesting and important new conclusions concerning the gating mechanism and mechanism of drug action for the P2X7 receptor. The work could be published anywhere and <i>eLife</i> is fortunate to have this one. Revision should be straightforward."

In our opinion the authors overstate what their data actually shows. What is lacking is an agonist (ATP) bound P2X7 structure in which the turret has adopted an active compact conformation. They should carefully revise the manuscript to address this, and perhaps explain why this was not done, and an indirect approach of functional assays with Cys mutants and MTS-TPAE adopted."

We therefore avoided describing potential specific-interactions, such as hydrogen bonding. We also performed site-directed mutagenesis for the drug-surrounding residues, where we validated the involvement of these residues in drug-binding. Nevertheless, locations and orientations of the side chains around the drug-binding pocket are well-supported by the reasonable electron density in these regions. To clarify these points, we added 1) a sentence in the main text describing the limitation of our current structures, 2) a new video (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) showing the electron density of the drug-binding residues around one of the antagonists (JNJ47965567), and 3) a new figure (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) that shows the side chain electron density for the residues comprising the turret (\u03b213 and \u03b214) and the \u03b1-helix whose helical-register was questioned.

Unfortunately, the angle of this figure prevents readers from appreciating how good the side chain densities are, as the point of this figure was to show no obvious density in the drug-binding pocket. The newly added figure (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) should solve this issue. In addition, combining the fact that the helical register in this region is consistent with those of P2X3 and P2X4, miss-assignment of residues in this region is highly unlikely."

While there is a chance that the side chain rotamer is incorrect, a wrongly assigned rotamer should not have major impact on the models shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, as the approximate orientation of each side chain should remain the same. Likewise, the HOLE plots would be only minutely different, if different side chain conformations are used. Indeed, positions of the peptide backbone account for the major differences in the HOLE plots."

In our opinion the authors overstate what their data actually shows. What is lacking is an agonist (ATP) bound P2X7 structure in which the turret has adopted an active compact conformation. They should carefully revise the manuscript to address this, and perhaps explain why this was not done, and an indirect approach of functional assays with Cys mutants and MTS-TPAE adopted.</i>"
