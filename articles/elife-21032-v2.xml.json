                    "text": "Mechanisms underlying the vein development remain largely unknown. Tie2 signaling mediates endothelial cell (EC) survival and vascular maturation and its activating mutations are linked to venous malformations. Here we show that vein formation are disrupted in mouse skin and mesentery when Tie2 signals are diminished by targeted deletion of <i>Tek</i> either ubiquitously or specifically in embryonic ECs. Postnatal Tie2 attenuation resulted in the degeneration of newly formed veins followed by the formation of haemangioma-like vascular tufts in retina and venous tortuosity. Mechanistically, Tie2 insufficiency compromised venous EC identity, as indicated by a significant decrease of COUP-TFII protein level, a key regulator in venogenesis. Consistently, angiopoietin-1 stimulation increased COUP-TFII in cultured ECs, while Tie2 knockdown or blockade of Tie2 downstream PI3K/Akt pathway reduced COUP-TFII which could be reverted by the proteasome inhibition. Together, our results imply that Tie2 is essential for venous specification and maintenance via Akt mediated stabilization of COUP-TFII."

Tie2 signaling mediates endothelial cell (EC) survival and vascular maturation and its activating mutations are linked to venous malformations. Here we show that vein formation are disrupted in mouse skin and mesentery when Tie2 signals are diminished by targeted deletion of <i>Tek</i> either ubiquitously or specifically in embryonic ECs. Postnatal Tie2 attenuation resulted in the degeneration of newly formed veins followed by the formation of haemangioma-like vascular tufts in retina and venous tortuosity. Mechanistically, Tie2 insufficiency compromised venous EC identity, as indicated by a significant decrease of COUP-TFII protein level, a key regulator in venogenesis. Consistently, angiopoietin-1 stimulation increased COUP-TFII in cultured ECs, while Tie2 knockdown or blockade of Tie2 downstream PI3K/Akt pathway reduced COUP-TFII which could be reverted by the proteasome inhibition. Together, our results imply that Tie2 is essential for venous specification and maintenance via Akt mediated stabilization of COUP-TFII."

The VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 pathway mediates activation of RAF1 and ERK1/2 kinases to induce the expression of genes required for arterial development (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lanahan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Deng et al., 2013</a>), including Delta-like 4 (Dll4) that activates NOTCH signaling (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lawson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Duarte et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wythe et al., 2013</a>). Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, SOX17 and FOXC1/2 were also reported to participate in arterial development via activation of the NOTCH pathway (<a href=\"#bib26\">Seo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Corada et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2013</a>). In contrast, knowledge on venogenesis is still limited. COUP-TFII, a transcription factor expressed in venous but not arterial endothelial cells (ECs), has been shown to regulate venous identity via the inhibition of NOTCH mediated signals (<a href=\"#bib37\">You et al., 2005</a>). Vice versa, NOTCH activation has been shown to down-regulate COUP-TFII expression (<a href=\"#bib30\">Swift et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, Akt activation was shown to inhibit Raf1-ERK1/2 signaling in ECs to favor venous specification (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ren et al., 2010</a>). To date, however, the specific factors upstream of the Akt pathway that define venous EC identity remain unclear."

Tie2 deficiency led to embryonic lethality resulting from the defective vascular remodeling and heart development (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dumont et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Sato et al., 1995</a>), and combined deletion of Tie2 ligands Ang1 and Ang2 in mice was also shown to disrupt Schlemm\u2019s canal formation leading to ocular hypertension and glaucoma (<a href=\"#bib31\">Thomson et al., 2014</a>). Patients with venous malformations were shown to have Tie2 missense point mutations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Vikkula et al., 1996</a>), leading to ligand-independent Tie2 activation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Limaye et al., 2009</a>). However, the underlying mechanism of Tie2 function in the blood vessels has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we show that Tie2 deficiency or insufficiency induced by gene targeting leads to defective vein formation and maintenance during embryogenesis and postnatal development. Findings from this study suggest that Tie2 is essential for the specification of venous EC identity via the Akt mediated regulation of COUP-TFII protein stability."

                                "text": "To investigate the role of Tie2 later during embryogenesis, we employed the <i>Ubc-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></i> and <i>Cdh5-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></i> deletor mouse lines (<a href=\"#bib33\">Wang et al., 2010</a>), to generate the doubly transgenic mice (<i>Tek<sup>Flox/\u2212</sup>/Ubc-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>,</i> named Tek<sup>\u2212/iUCKO</sup>; or <i>Tek<sup>Flox/\u2212</sup>/Cdh5-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>,</i> named Tek<sup>\u2212/iECKO</sup>). <i>Tek<sup>Flox/+</sup>/Ubc-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></i> or <i>Tek<sup>Flox/+</sup>/Cdh5-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></i> littermate mice were used as controls. Tie2 deletion efficiency was examined by immunostaining with skin and also by real-time RT-PCR with lung of <i>Tek</i> mutant mice (Tek<sup>\u2212/iECKO</sup>: 0.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07, n\u00a0=\u00a03; Tek<sup>+/iECKO</sup>: 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.26, n\u00a0=\u00a03; Tek<sup>\u2212/iUCKO</sup>: 0.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02, n\u00a0=\u00a04; Tek<sup>+/iUCKO</sup>: 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11, n\u00a0=\u00a04). Analysis of veins in skin at E15.5 showed that venogenesis was disrupted in both types of mutant embryos, in which <i>Tek</i> deletion was induced by intraperitoneal injections of tamoxifen into pregnant mice at E10.5\u201312.5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In addition, defective vein formation was also observed in the skin of E17.5 Tek<sup>\u2212/iUCKO</sup> embryos when <i>Tek</i> deletion was induced at E12.5\u201314.5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Lack of bleeding or edema with the later targeting suggests a stage-dependent function of Tie2 during the establishment of vascular integrity. Interestingly, veins were detected in mesentery, but unlike in littermate controls, they did not align properly with the arteries (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Furthermore, lymphatic vessels originate mainly from veins during embryonic development in mammals. It is therefore interesting to find out whether lymphatic development is altered in Tie2 knockout mice when the vein formation is defective. We found that lymphatic vessels were present in the skin of Tek<sup>\u2212/iECKO</sup> mutant mice, but became dilated (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This may be secondary to tissue edema resulting from the impairment of blood vasculature. However, it is also possible that Tie2 may have a role at earlier stages of lymphatic development."

The efficiency of <i>Tek</i> deletion was examined by Western blot analysis, immunostaining and real-time RT-PCR. Little Tie2 protein was detected in the lung and retina of Tek<sup>\u2212/iUCKO</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). The level of Tie2 mRNA in the same tissues of Tek<sup>\u2212/iUCKO</sup> mice was approximately 13\u201318% of the control mice as shown in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. Consistent with the results from Western blot analysis, the deletion efficiency of Tie2 as analyzed by real-time RT-PCR in lungs of Tek<sup>\u2212/iECKO</sup> mice was lower than that of Tek<sup>\u2212/iUCKO</sup> mutants (Tek<sup>\u2212/iECKO</sup>: 0.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10, n\u00a0=\u00a04; Tek<sup>+/iECKO</sup>: 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21, n\u00a0=\u00a04). The partial Tie2 deletion was also indicated by the mosaic GFP expression when the mTmG allele was crossed into the <i>Tek</i> mutant mice to generate the compound genetic mouse model (Tek<sup>\u2212/iECKO</sup><i>;mTmG</i>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Muzumdar et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, the decrease of Tie2 in the Tek<sup>\u2212/iUCKO</sup> and Tek<sup>\u2212/iECKO</sup> mice resulted in a significant decrease of retinal vascularization, as indicated by a lower vascular index (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013F</a>). As Tie2 is also expressed by some hematopoietic cells, we generated mutant mice with <i>Tek</i> deletion in blood cells (<i>Tek<sup>Flox/\u2212</sup>;Vav-iCre</i>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">de Boer et al., 2003</a>). No obvious defects were observed in the retinal blood vessels of the mutant mice (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>)."

The abnormal angiogenesis along the retinal veins was also seen at P11 in mice with postnatal <i>Tek</i> deletion, and the morphology of veins was severely disrupted at P15 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>, arrows). Vein degeneration was accompanied by the formation of haemangioma-like vascular tufts by P21 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, arrows). The massive angiogenic vascular growth occurred mainly in the first layer of retinal vessels of Tek<sup>\u2212/iUCKO</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In contrast to wildtype littermate control mice, Tek<sup>\u2212/iUCKO</sup>mutant mice at P21 exhibited little blood vessel growth towards the deep layers of retina (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Vessels in the vascular tufts in the Tek<sup>\u2212/iUCKO</sup> mice had lumens and were covered with NG2<sup>+</sup> pericytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Furthermore, <i>Tek</i> deletion at a later stage (P5-8) resulted in a similar but milder vascular phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, arrows). For comparison, we also performed the analysis of retinal blood vasculature at different time points with Tek<sup>-/iECKO</sup> mice, but did not observe the formation of vascular tufts. This may be due to the lower efficiency of <i>Tek</i> gene deletion as discussed above."

As the Tie2 downstream Akt activation was significantly suppressed in mice with Tie2 attenuation, we also analyzed COUP-TFII level when the PI3K/Akt pathway was blocked. COUP-TFII protein was significantly reduced 6 hr or 12 hr after treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a>; LY-3h: 1.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39, n\u00a0=\u00a05; LY-6h: 0.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12, n\u00a0=\u00a05; LY-12h: 0.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13, n\u00a0=\u00a05; values from five independent experiments normalized against control at three time points respectively).

Interestingly, Tie2 is also downregulated in the sprouting tip endothelial cells as observed in retinal angiogenesis in this study and also by others (<a href=\"#bib2\">Augustin et al., 2009</a>). It has been recently reported that vein-derived endothelial tip cells contribute to the emerging arteries during mouse retinal vascularization and also in zebrafish fin regeneration (<a href=\"#bib36\">Xu et al., 2014</a>). This suggests that the downregulation of Tie2 may be required for the initial establishment of an arterial EC identity. Consistently, we have demonstrated in this study that Tie2 absence or insufficiency by gene targeting disrupts venogenesis during embryogenesis and postnatal development. At the molecular level, we have found that Tie2 participates in the determination of venous EC identity, which may act via Akt-mediated regulation of COUP-TFII protein stability. This implies that Tie2/Akt signaling counterbalances VEGFR2/MAPK pathway in arteriovenous specification during the vascular development. The findings are consistent with previous literature on the role of Akt in venous development, and with the recent report that cardiomyocyte derived Ang1 is required for the subepicardial coronary vein formation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Deng et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ren et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Zimmermann and Moelling, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Lamont and Childs, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arita et al., 2014</a>)."

Blood vessels developed normally in mice with <i>Tek</i> deletion in blood cells, while disruption of vein development was observed in Tek<sup>\u2212/iUCKO</sup> as well as in Tek<sup>\u2212/iECKO</sup> mutant mice. This suggests that the disruption of cutaneous vein development during embryogenesis is likely to be a cell-autonomous effect resulting from the deletion of Tie2 in endothelial cells. In postnatal studies, we found that there was a dramatic increase of blood vessel growth after the ubiquitous Tie2 attenuation, which led to the formation of haemangioma-like vascular tufts along the retinal veins in the <i>Tek</i> mutant mice. Although a significant decrease of retinal vascularization was observed in Tek<sup>\u2212/iECKO</sup> mice, we did not observe the vascular tuft formation in the retina of these mutants. This may result from the lower Tie2 deletion efficiency in Tek<sup>\u2212/iECKO</sup> mice when compared with that of Tek<sup>\u2212/iUCKO</sup> mice. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that Tie2 deletion in other non-endothelial cells may contribute to the vascular abnormalities in retinas of Tek<sup>\u2212/iUCKO</sup> mutant mice. As retinal neovascularization is one of the frequent causes of vision loss in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gariano and Gardner, 2005</a>), these data suggests that reduction of Tie2 mediated signals in ECs and / or other Tie2 expressing cells may be implicated in the vascular pathologies."

In the vascular system, COUP-TFII has been shown to regulate venous EC identity as well as lymphatic EC specification (<a href=\"#bib37\">You et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Srinivasan et al., 2010</a>). At the transcription level, COUP-TFII is regulated by several factors / pathways including NOTCH and SOX7/18 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Swift et al., 2014</a>). In this study, we have found that COUP-TFII protein but not its mRNA level is significantly reduced in genetically engineered mouse model targeting <i>Tek</i>. Based on the evidence obtained from the biochemical analysis with cultured endothelial cells, we propose that Akt is a strong candidate mediating Tie2 signals in this process. As Akt acts downstream of many signaling pathways and that it is also activated in many cell types, it remains to be investigated how Akt regulates COUP-TFII protein stability in venous ECs. Also, further in vivo mechanistic studies are required for validating and fully elucidating Akt and others factors / pathways downstream of Tie2 in venous specification. In addition, we have also found that the requirement of Tie2 for vein development differs between the skin and mesentery. When Tie2 levels were reduced by gene targeting, veins were mostly undetectable in the skin, but displayed only abnormal arterial-venous alignment in the mesentery. It is possible that the cutaneous veins are more sensitive to the loss of Tie2 mediated signals, or that venogenesis occurs earlier in the mesentery than in the skin. The abnormal arteriovenous alignment resembled that of the APJ deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kidoya et al., 2015</a>), and a significant reduction of APJ in the <i>Tek</i> mutants suggests that APJ acts downstream of Tie2 in the regulation of venous patterning."

As Dok family members have been shown to negatively regulate ERK1/2 activation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Honma et al., 2006</a>), the decrease of Dok-2 may lead to the increase of retinal angiogenesis as detected in mice with Tie2 reduction by gene targeting. Consistently, enhancement of Tie2 signaling via the inhibition of VE-PTP has been shown to stabilize blood vessels and suppress retinal angiogenesis in mouse models of ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization (<a href=\"#bib28\">Shen et al., 2014b</a>). Furthermore, in experiments using HEK 293\u00a0T or endothelial cells overexpressing Dok2, it was found that Dok2, via directly interacting with Tie2, mediated Tie2 pathway in endothelial cell migration (<a href=\"#bib24\">Saharinen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Master et al., 2001</a>). Decreased Dok-2 activation in <i>Tek</i> mutants may also account for the suppression of horizontal and vertical blood vessel growth during retinal vascular network formation. So far, in vivo evidence about the role of Dok2 in blood vascular development is still missing. Further studies employing animal models targeting <i>Dok2</i> are important to analyze its biological functions in the vascular system."

Related to the findings of this study, activating mutations of Tie2 have been linked to venous malformations in patients (<a href=\"#bib32\">Vikkula et al., 1996</a>). It is still poorly understood about the difference between the pathways downstream of activating Tie2 mutants and the wildtype Tie2. Activation of wildtype Tie2 by its ligand Ang1 or VE-PTP inhibition, at least for a short period, has been shown to stabilize blood vasculature (<a href=\"#bib28\">Shen et al., 2014b</a>), while activating Tie2 mutations lead to venous malformations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Vikkula et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Limaye et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Boscolo et al., 2015</a>).

As alteration of Tie2 mediated signals may be implicated in a variety of vascular pathologies associated with the venous system, further investigation along these lines may help to develop novel Tie2-targeted therapeutics."

In the retina there is a reduced horizontal growth of the vasculature and the presence of malformations along the length of the veins. In the skin, veins look tortuous. Arterial and venous markers are partially modified. In HUVEC silenced for Tie2 or lung and liver tissues Coup-TFII is reduced."

The major weakness is the lack of a detailed mechanistic analysis of how Tie-2 acts in inducing venous differentiation. Data on the role of Akt are suggestive but a marked reduction of COUP-TFII is detectable only in HUVEC KD for Tie-2 and is much less apparent in the tissues. Other published studies showed an increase in cultured cells of Akt and STAT 1 upon infection with Tie-2 gain of function mutant. In addition, inherited gain of function mutations of Tie-2 induce a strong venous endothelial cell proliferation and formation of large hemangiomas inhibited by Rapamycin (for instance Boscolo et al. J Clin invest). To my view the authors should extend their studies on the mechanism of action of Tie-2 also adding novel observations as compared to previously published literature."

Is this solely due to different recombination efficacies of the different drivers or would this difference raise the question whether endothelial cell autonomous effects may not be the only cause of defective vein development in Tie2-deficient mice?

These data have been discussed rather insufficiently. The authors should comparatively analyze COUP-TFII transcript levels and other downstream players such as pAkt and pDok-2 in these two vascular beds in order to dissect the mechanisms, which help the retinal veins to \"recover\" but not the cutaneous veins. Likewise, partial recombination will lead to a mosaic vasculature of WT and KO cells. If such mosaic mice are traced over time, there is a good chance that the KO cells will be competed out by WT cells. As such, it is critical, particularly in the longer term experiments to carefully trace the percentage of cells with Tie2 deletion at the later time points of analysis."

They conclude at the end of the discussion that the findings put a cautionary note on long term Tie2 targeting therapies, e.g., during tumor angiogenesis. This may not be the most important point of the study. In fact, nobody tries to target Tie2. Ang2 neutralizing strategies primarily work cooperatively with VEGF pathway targeting drugs based on their vascular normalization Tie2 gain-of-function effect. The same holds true for VE-PTP inhibitors or the recently published ABTAA antibody. What this reviewer finds much more exciting is the role of Tie2 on venogenesis. Venogenesis has mostly been considered as the default pathway with transcriptional programs driving lymphatic and arterial differentiation. The identification of Tie2 signaling as upstream regulator of COUP-TFII is a major finding that should likely be discussed in more detail. The fact that Tie2 KO leads in part to the acquisition of an arterial phenotype is noteworthy and suggests something of an arteriovenous identity balance mechanism. Likewise, angiogenesis is an arterializing process. As such, the physiological downregulation of Tie2 in the angiogenic tip cell vasculature should/could likely be discussed in the context of the findings of this manuscript. Obviously, it is at the discretion of the authors to prioritize the discussion, but it is felt that the authors may in the present version of the manuscript not have discussed the most obvious and most exciting implications of their work."

In addition, inherited gain of function mutations of Tie-2 induce a strong venous endothelial cell proliferation and formation of large hemangiomas inhibited by Rapamycin (for instance Boscolo et al.

They conclude at the end of the discussion that the findings put a cautionary note on long term Tie2 targeting therapies, e.g., during tumor angiogenesis. This may not be the most important point of the study. In fact, nobody tries to target Tie2. Ang2 neutralizing strategies primarily work cooperatively with VEGF pathway targeting drugs based on their vascular normalization Tie2 gain-of-function effect. The same holds true for VE-PTP inhibitors or the recently published ABTAA antibody. What this reviewer finds much more exciting is the role of Tie2 on venogenesis. Venogenesis has mostly been considered as the default pathway with transcriptional programs driving lymphatic and arterial differentiation. The identification of Tie2 signaling as upstream regulator of COUP-TFII is a major finding that should likely be discussed in more detail. The fact that Tie2 KO leads in part to the acquisition of an arterial phenotype is noteworthy and suggests something of an arteriovenous identity balance mechanism. Likewise, angiogenesis is an arterializing process. As such, the physiological downregulation of Tie2 in the angiogenic tip cell vasculature should/could likely be discussed in the context of the findings of this manuscript. Obviously, it is at the discretion of the authors to prioritize the discussion, but it is felt that the authors may in the present version of the manuscript not have discussed the most obvious and most exciting implications of their work.</i>"

The finding was supported by the biochemical analysis with in vitro cultured endothelial cells. Firstly, consistent with the results from Tie2 knockdown by siRNA, the COUP-TFII level was increased by COMP-Ang1 stimulation to activate the Tie2/Akt pathway (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E and F</a>). Secondly, a significant reduction of COUP-TFII was achieved by the inhibition of Akt using MK2206 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I, J</a>), which validated the results from PI3K inhibition by LY294002 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G, H</a>). The decrease of COUP-TFII by the Akt inhibition could be reverted by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K and L</a>).
