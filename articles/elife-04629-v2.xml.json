Curiously, some bacteria have the ability to switch to a wall-free or \u2018L-form\u2019 state. Although known for decades, the general properties of L-forms are poorly understood, largely due to the lack of systematic analysis of L-forms in the molecular biology era. Here we show that inhibition of peptidoglycan precursor synthesis promotes the generation of L-forms from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We show that the L-forms generated have in common a mechanism of proliferation involving membrane blebbing and tubulation, which is dependent on an altered rate of membrane synthesis. Crucially, this mode of proliferation is independent of the essential FtsZ based division machinery. Our results suggest that the L-form mode of proliferation is conserved across the bacterial kingdom, reinforcing the idea that it could have been used in primitive cells, and opening up its use in the generation of synthetic cells."

Excessive production of membrane leads to the cell changing shape, resulting in spontaneous separation into daughter cells."

PG is composed of long glycan strands cross linked by short peptide bridges, forming a meshwork that covers the whole cell. The wall has a variety of important functions, including the following: maintenance of cell shape, protection from mechanical damage, and generation of turgor by restraining the outward osmotic pressure exerted on the cytoplasmic membrane. It is the target for our best antibiotics (\u03b2-lactams, glycopeptides, etc), and fragments of the wall trigger important innate immune responses. The wall is assembled by polymerization and cross linking of a precursor molecule, termed lipid II, which is synthesized in the cytoplasm and then transferred to the cell surface for wall assembly (<a href=\"#bib35\">Typas et al., 2012</a>)."

Generally, L-forms were generated under osmoprotective conditions (e.g. in the presence of 0.5 M sucrose) by long term and repeated passage, sometimes for years, in the presence of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics that inhibit PG synthesis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allan, 1991</a>).

We have defined genetic pathways required to elicit a reproducible and rapid switch to the L-form state and identified genes required specifically for L-form growth in this organism (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leaver et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dominguez-Cuevas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mercier et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2013</a>). Our analysis of <i>B. subtilis</i> L-form growth led to two unexpected findings. First, that when dividing in the L-form state, <i>B. subtilis</i> becomes completely independent of the FtsZ (tubulin) based division machinery (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leaver et al., 2009</a>) and the MreB (actin) cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mercier et al., 2012</a>). Instead, the L-forms divide by a remarkable process of cell shape deformation, including blebbing, tubulation, and vesiculation, followed by spontaneous resolution (scission) into smaller progeny cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kandler and Kandler, 1954</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Leaver et al., 2009</a>). We recently showed that L-form proliferation in <i>B. subtilis</i> simply depends on excess membrane synthesis, leading to an increase in the surface area to volume ratio (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mercier et al., 2013</a>). Upregulation of membrane synthesis can be driven directly, by mutations affecting the regulation of fatty acid synthesis, or indirectly, by shutting down PG precursor synthesis, which presumably depends on a regulatory circuit that we do not yet understand. To complicate matters, the growth of <i>B. subtilis</i> L-forms requires a second mutational change, most commonly affecting the <i>ispA</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leaver et al., 2009</a>), which probably works by compensating for a metabolic imbalance that occurs when cells grow in the absence of wall synthesis (Kawai and Mercier, unpublished)."

We have also characterized several key properties of these L-forms, including their mode of proliferation, and we have found them to be strikingly reminiscent of <i>B. subtilis</i> L-forms, in the following ways: (i) mode of cell proliferation using cell shape deformation followed by a spontaneous formation of progeny cells; (ii) dispensability of the normally essential cell division machinery; and (iii) key role for the membrane synthesis rate in cell proliferation."

To simplify the experiments, we used biochemical inhibitors of the PG precursor pathway, fosfomycin (FOS) or D-cycloserine (DCS), which inhibit the enzymes MurA and Ddl, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We examined three different organisms: two Gram-positive organisms, the Firmicute <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> ATCC29213 and the Actinobacterium <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i> ATCC13032, and the Gram-negative organism, <i>E. coli</i> strain MG1655. In all three cases, we were readily able to generate an L-form transition. <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>E. coli</i> were both susceptible to FOS at 400 \u03bcg/ml. <i>C. glutamicum</i> was resistant to FOS but susceptible to DCS at the same concentration. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> (D, F, H) shows that the growth of all three strains on NA was inhibited in the presence of the drug (lipid II OFF). However, as observed in <i>B. subtilis</i>, growth of all three strains was efficiently restored under osmoprotective conditions (lipid II OFF, MSM). Furthermore, phase contrast microscopy of the three treated cultures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E, G, I</a>; OFF) revealed the presence of large spheroidal cells strikingly similar to the L-forms of <i>B. subtilis</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and quite different from the parental walled cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E, G, I</a>; ON), consistent with the idea that all three diverse organisms are able to switch to an L-form mode of proliferation on inhibition of the PG precursor pathway. We further showed that L-forms of the three different species could be successively propagated in the presence of high (500 \u03bcg/ml) concentrations of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) in concentrations that are normally lethal in walled cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Finally, on reactivation of PG precursor synthesis, the three different species readily reverted to their parental walled forms (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>), by de novo synthesis of the cell wall sacculus (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kawai et al., 2014</a>)."

Thus, to test whether FOS or DCS are sufficient to promote the full switch to an L-form mode of proliferation, we assessed whether the PG precursor pathway genes were essential in the genetically tractable bacterium <i>E. coli</i>. We first constructed plasmid pOU82-<i>murA</i>, which carried a copy of <i>murA</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> located on an unstable mini-R1 plasmid (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gerdes et al., 1985</a>), together with a <i>lacZ</i> gene encoding \u03b2-galactosidase. In the presence of this plasmid, we were then able to construct a chromosomal deletion of <i>murA</i>, which is an essential gene of the PG precursor pathway (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), giving strain RM345 (<i>murA</i>::<i>Kn</i>, pOU82-<i>murA</i>). In walled cells, the presence of plasmid pOU82-<i>murA</i> was essential for growth of strain RM345 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, bottom), as demonstrated by the uniform blue colonies on X-gal, while it was readily lost from the parental TB28 strain (<i>murA</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>), giving many white colonies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, top). Strikingly, the plasmid was also readily lost from strain RM345 when grown in the putatively L-form state, as indicated by the white colonies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To confirm the specific loss of the <i>murA</i> gene, we performed a multiplex PCR (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 below) on DNA purified from cells of strain RM345 grown in the presence of the cell wall or as L-forms. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, in the walled state, the <i>murA</i> gene was readily detected (lane 1) whereas it was not detected in the DNA from a white L-form colony (lane 2)."

Importantly, this growth defect was restored by a <i>fabH</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> complementing plasmid (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, left). Similar results were obtained using cerulenin, an antibiotic that inhibits FA synthesis, which specifically inhibited L-form proliferation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Finally, to demonstrate whether FA synthesis regulation was essential for <i>E. coli</i> L-form proliferation, we constructed a strain bearing a double deletion of <i>murA</i> and <i>fabH</i> (strain RM369, <i>murA</i>, fabH::Kn pSK122-<i>murA</i>, pOU82-fabH) bearing <i>murA</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> on an unstable mini-F plasmid and <i>fabH</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> on an unstable mini-R1 plasmid. This strain was grown in both walled and L-form states on NA/MSM plates with no direct selection for the plasmids. After DNA extraction, we assessed the presence of the <i>murA</i> and <i>fabH</i> genes using multiplex PCR. As expected, in the walled state, the <i>murA</i> gene was retained because PG synthesis is essential, but the <i>fabH</i> gene was lost, because <i>E. coli</i> apparently has a second activity capable of supporting the <i>fabH</i> function (<a href=\"#bib37\">Yao et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, lane 1). Strikingly, in the L-form state, the opposite was observed: <i>murA</i> was lost, while <i>fabH</i> was retained (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, lane 2), supporting the idea that a higher rate of FA synthesis is required for proliferation of <i>E. coli</i> in the L-form state."

The wide range of methods used to create L-forms has probably contributed to the heterogeneity in phenotypic properties and has made it difficult to define general properties for L-form bacteria (<a href=\"#bib14\">Domingue and Woody, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Allan et al., 2009</a>). Included in the range of cells designated L-form \u2018like\u2019 have been cell types in which the PG synthesis machinery remained essential for proliferation (e.g. the <i>E. coli</i> cells of <a href=\"#bib20\">Joseleau-Petit et al., 2007</a> and <a href=\"#bib9\">Cambre et al., 2014</a>). Given that we have now shown that <i>E. coli</i> can be converted into a state in which the cell wall precursor pathway can be deleted and cells become completely resistant to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, we suggest that in future the term L-form be restricted to fully wall deficient cells."

Perhaps surprisingly, this approach appears to have been tried only rarely in previous L-form work (<a href=\"#bib31\">Schmid, 1984</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">1985</a>). We showed here that inhibition of the PG precursor pathway readily generates L-forms in diverse bacteria of both Gram-positive (<i>S. aureus</i> and <i>C. glutamicum</i>) and Gram-negative (<i>E. coli</i>) varieties. Furthermore, this method generated genuine cell wall-free proliferative bacteria, as their growth was not inhibited by high concentrations of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and, more importantly, essential PG synthesis genes could be deleted (at least for <i>B. subtilis</i> and <i>E. coli</i>). Finally, as the PG precursor synthesis pathway is almost ubiquitous in bacteria, it is reasonable that this method could be applied to a very wide range of bacteria."

Remarkably, <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>E. coli</i> L-forms share the ability to proliferate independently of FtsZ, and although definitive experiments are more difficult to perform in <i>C. glutamicum</i>, it appears that they will also share this property. Thus FtsZ independent proliferation is a common trait of bacterial L-forms, presumably reflecting their strange blebbing/tubulation mode of growth.

Additionally, as previously observed for <i>B. subtilis</i>, a minor reduction in FA synthesis prevented the growth of both <i>C. glutamicum</i> and <i>E. coli</i> L-forms, supporting the idea that all three L-forms divide by a similar mechanism based on an increased ratio of surface area to volume synthesis. Thus it appears that evolutionarily divergent bacteria, with different envelope structures (e.g. Gram-positive and Gram-negative), shape (e.g. rod vs sphere), and different modes of cell wall extension (e.g. lateral and apical) have retained a common primitive mode of proliferation when forced to grow in the absence of a cell wall. Interestingly, this mode of proliferation is strikingly similar to the mode of proliferation of simple vesicle systems independent of protein based machineries (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hanczyc et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Budin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Terasawa et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, our results strengthen the idea that the L-form mode of proliferation could have been used by a common ancestor of the bacteria prior to the invention of the cell wall, and are consistent with the notion that invention of the wall was a pivotal moment in the evolutionary divergence of the bacterial lineage (<a href=\"#bib16\">Errington, 2013</a>)."

Apart from its apparent importance for understanding an early step in the evolution of life, the simple mechanism of proliferation of L-forms may find application in attempts to design and engineer synthetic self-replicative systems, or minimal cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Caspi and Dekker, 2014</a>). The ability to delete and then restore normally essential genes in L-forms offers a powerful new model system with which to investigate important properties of the cell wall synthesis and cell division machineries, with implications for the discovery and development of novel antibacterials (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bugg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">den Blaauwen et al., 2014</a>)."

Earlier molecular work was focused on L-forms in <i>Bacillus</i> and thus how general the phenomenon would be was not apparent. Here, studies have been extended to several other bacteria, <i>E. coli</i>, <i>S. aureus</i> and the actinobacterium <i>Corynebacterium</i>. As a consequence, several common principles of L-form proliferation are established, e.g. reduced or blocked peptidoglycan synthesis and excessive membrane synthesis. These commonalities are exciting in that they demonstrate that the same principles apply in completely different bacteria, i.e. Gram (+) and Gram (-), and those that grow by lateral wall extension (<i>Bacillus</i>, <i>E. coli</i>) as well as at the apex (<i>Corynebacterium</i>). Also, the work is very well carried out, and wonderful movies are provided of L-form proliferation. Overall the manuscript is in excellent shape. However, we all felt that the results should be discussed from an evolutionary perspective. These are very important findings that significantly reinforce the idea that L-form growth represents a primitive mode of proliferation that was likely used by the last common ancestor of bacteria and this should be discussed. The authors can easily accomplish this with some text revision. In addition, we felt that the authors should tone down the claims that this work provides major new molecular insights. The key contribution is that of establishing the generality of L-form proliferation."

This would be useful as the main conclusions from this manuscript are evolution-oriented. What happens with the outer membrane, e.g. when <i>E. coli</i> cells are turned into L-forms? And how is the outer membrane structure restored once L-forms are allowed to resynthesize PG? Although the underlying mechanism might be beyond the scope of this story, it would at least be worth to speculate about the major differences between these different prokaryotes. It is also important to reflect on how the cells (L forms) protect themselves as it is hard to believe the membrane is the only barrier with the outside world. Maybe comparison to protoplasts is interesting, though admittedly highly speculative."

The authors state on that previous work has been largely \u201cdescriptive and anecdotal\u201d. This current paper does not, however, provide new molecular insights over e.g. Mercier 2012 and Leaver 2009, but rather extends the knowledge of Bacillus to other bacteria. The fact that the cell division machinery (Leaver 2009) or MreB (Mercier 2012) are not required for L-form growth was published in previous work, as was the correlation between PG and membrane synthesis (Mercier 2013) and the mode of proliferation. Therefore, the main advance of this work lies in the direction of evolution, showing that the discoveries made in Bacillus are in fact common principles shared by different bacteria."

Maybe comparison to protoplasts is interesting, though admittedly highly speculative</i>."

The fact that the cell division machinery (Leaver 2009) or MreB (Mercier 2012) are not required for L-form growth was published in previous work, as was the correlation between PG and membrane synthesis (Mercier 2013) and the mode of proliferation.
