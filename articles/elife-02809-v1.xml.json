Current drugs for T2D lower blood glucose levels, but they do not directly alleviate \u03b2 cell stress nor prevent, let alone reverse, \u03b2 cell de-differentiation. We show here that Urocortin 3 (Ucn3), a marker for mature \u03b2 cells, is down-regulated in the early stages of T2D in mice and when \u03b2 cells are stressed <i>in vitro</i>. Using an insulin expression-coupled lineage tracer, with Ucn3 as a reporter for the mature \u03b2 cell state, we screen for factors that reverse \u03b2 cell de-differentiation. We find that a small molecule inhibitor of TGF\u03b2 receptor I (Alk5) protects cells from the loss of key \u03b2 cell transcription factors and restores a mature \u03b2 cell identity even after exposure to prolonged and severe diabetes."
