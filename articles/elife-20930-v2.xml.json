Here we report crystal structures of ectodomain fragments comprising cell-cell recognition regions of mouse \u03b3-Pcdhs \u03b3A1, \u03b3A8, \u03b3B2, and \u03b3B7 revealing <i>trans</i>-homodimers, and of C-terminal ectodomain fragments from \u03b3-Pcdhs \u03b3A4 and \u03b3B2, which depict <i>cis</i>-interacting regions in monomeric form. Together these structures span the entire \u03b3-Pcdh ectodomain. The <i>trans</i>-dimer structures reveal determinants of \u03b3-Pcdh isoform-specific homophilic recognition. We identified and structurally mapped <i>cis</i>-dimerization mutations to the C-terminal ectodomain structures. Biophysical studies showed that Pcdh ectodomains from \u03b3B-subfamily isoforms formed <i>cis</i> dimers, whereas \u03b3A isoforms did not, but both \u03b3A and \u03b3B isoforms could interact in <i>cis</i> with \u03b1-Pcdhs. Together, these data show how interaction specificity is distributed over all domains of the \u03b3-Pcdh <i>trans</i> interface, and suggest that subfamily- or isoform-specific <i>cis</i>-interactions may play a role in the Pcdh-mediated neuronal self-recognition code."

Here we report crystal structures of ectodomain fragments comprising cell-cell recognition regions of mouse \u03b3-Pcdhs \u03b3A1, \u03b3A8, \u03b3B2, and \u03b3B7 revealing <i>trans</i>-homodimers, and of C-terminal ectodomain fragments from \u03b3-Pcdhs \u03b3A4 and \u03b3B2, which depict <i>cis</i>-interacting regions in monomeric form. Together these structures span the entire \u03b3-Pcdh ectodomain. The <i>trans</i>-dimer structures reveal determinants of \u03b3-Pcdh isoform-specific homophilic recognition. We identified and structurally mapped <i>cis</i>-dimerization mutations to the C-terminal ectodomain structures. Biophysical studies showed that Pcdh ectodomains from \u03b3B-subfamily isoforms formed <i>cis</i> dimers, whereas \u03b3A isoforms did not, but both \u03b3A and \u03b3B isoforms could interact in <i>cis</i> with \u03b1-Pcdhs. Together, these data show how interaction specificity is distributed over all domains of the \u03b3-Pcdh <i>trans</i> interface, and suggest that subfamily- or isoform-specific <i>cis</i>-interactions may play a role in the Pcdh-mediated neuronal self-recognition code."

This fundamental property of neural circuit assembly is accomplished through a mechanism that mediates \u2018self-avoidance\u2019 between sister branches from individual neurons, while permitting interactions between non-self neurons. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, self-avoidance is thought to require the generation of unique single cell surface identities through mechanisms that involve the stochastic expression of unique combinations of cell surface protein isoforms (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zipursky and Grueber, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen and Maniatis, 2013</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i> and many other invertebrates individual-neuron identities are provided by the expression of single-cell-specific Dscam1-isoform subsets generated by stochastic alternative splicing (<a href=\"#bib28\">Miura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Schmucker et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wojtowicz et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Neves et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zhan et al., 2004</a>).

In general, recognition between cells expressing multiple Pcdhs is only observed when all expressed isoforms match. In early work, <a href=\"#bib39\">Schreiner and Weiner (2010)</a> showed that expression of mismatched isoforms resulted in less binding between a cell population adhered to a surface and cells passed over them. We assessed the ability of cells co-transfected with up to five Pcdh isoforms to co-aggregate with cells containing various numbers of mismatches, and found that expression of even a single mismatch prevented co-aggregation in cell aggregation assays (<a href=\"#bib44\">Thu et al., 2014</a>). Thus, even a single mismatched isoform is able to interfere with recognition. Importantly, this behavior\u2014which we termed \u2018interference\u2019\u2014is not observed with classical cadherins (<a href=\"#bib44\">Thu et al., 2014</a>). We therefore suggested that the interference phenomenon could arise from promiscuous <i>cis</i> dimerization between co-expressed Pcdh isoforms to form single-cell repertoires of dimeric Pcdh recognition units (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rubinstein et al., 2015</a>)."

Structures of the <i>trans</i> dimer formed through this interface have been reported for two \u03b1-Pcdhs and two \u03b2-Pcdhs which revealed overall-similar recognition-dimer structures, mediated by interfaces populated with diverse residue compositions that determine homophilic specificity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Goodman et al., 2016</a>). Recently a <i>trans</i> dimer structure of a \u03b3B-Pcdh has also been reported (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nicoludis et al., 2016</a>). Unfortunately, this structure contained a HEPES molecule in the EC2:EC3 interface, preventing formation of native specificity-determining intermolecular contacts in this region. Because a major portion of the binding interface adopts a non-native conformation, we have excluded this structure from subsequent analyses, unless specifically stated otherwise. Here we report structures of recognition dimers from four \u03b3-Pcdhs, two from the \u03b3A subfamily, and two from the \u03b3B subfamily.

The \u03b3A1<sub>EC1\u20134</sub> crystal structure contained four molecules in the asymmetric unit: Two of which are arranged in an EC1\u20134-mediated antiparallel dimer, with all four EC domains involved in the dimer interaction (chains A and B); and two are arranged in an EC2\u20133-mediated antiparallel dimer, in which EC1 and EC4 are not involved in the dimer interaction (chains C and D) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The EC2\u20133 portion of the dimer interaction is very similar between the two dimers in the structure (RMSD\u00a0=\u00a00.98 \u00c5 over 415 C\u03b1\u2019s) and closely resembles the partial interaction observed in the previously published \u03b3A1<sub>EC1\u20133</sub> structure (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nicoludis et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The main difference between the two dimers in the \u03b3A1 crystal is therefore simply the presence or absence of the EC1:EC4 interaction. Since there are no protein domains filling the gap between EC1 and EC4 of chains C and D in the crystal, it is unclear why these domains do not interact. The fully engaged EC1\u20134-mediated dimer is similar to that of \u03b3B2<sub>EC1\u20135</sub> and \u03b3B7<sub>EC1\u20134</sub> and the published \u03b1- and \u03b2-Pcdh EC1\u20134-mediated dimers, involving the same interacting face of the molecule, however the RMSDs are quite large (4.3\u20135.0 \u00c5; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 3</a>), highlighting the architectural differences between the \u03b3A1<sub>EC1\u20134</sub> dimer and those of other Pcdh subtypes (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#SD7-data\">7</a>)."

This crystal also contained a distinct interaction between symmetry-related molecules, also mediated by an anti-parallel EC2\u20133 interface and with a similar buried surface area (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). In order to confirm which interface is the biological <i>trans</i> dimerization interface, we generated a number of \u03b3A8 arginine mutants separately targeting each of the observed interactions. Only those mutants that targeted the interaction surface in common with other Pcdhs resulted in loss of function in cell aggregation assays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

Remarkably, like the \u03b3A1<sub>EC1\u20134</sub> dimer observed between chains C and D, the EC1:EC4 interaction is not formed. However, in the case of \u03b3A8 the interaction surfaces of EC1 and EC4 instead make contacts with the EC4 domain of another symmetry-related molecule in the crystal. These EC1:EC4 interactions are distinct from\u00a0those observed in the fully engaged Pcdh <i>trans</i> dimers, although they utilize the same interaction surface of EC1. Since we have not observed molecular species larger than a dimer for Pcdh EC1\u20134 fragments we believe this alternative EC1:EC4 interaction, as well as the additional EC2:EC3 interaction, to be an artifact of crystallization."

To determine whether the EC2\u20133 regions are sufficient for dimerization of \u03b3-Pcdhs we produced EC1\u20133 fragments of two \u03b3As and a \u03b3B (\u03b3A1, \u03b3A4, and \u03b3B6).

Excluding the structurally diverse \u03b3A-Pcdhs and the partially occluded \u03b3B3 dimer (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nicoludis et al., 2016</a>), the EC1\u20134 dimers of isoforms from the same subfamily have similar overall structures (RMSDs\u00a0~1.5\u20133.4 \u00c5; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 3</a>). This similarity is even more apparent when the two mutually exclusive interaction regions (EC1:EC4 and EC2\u20133:EC2\u20133) are compared separately revealing RMSDs of\u00a0&lt;2 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#SD5-data\">5</a>). In contrast, superpositions of dimers from different subfamilies in general revealed larger RMSDs due to distinct relative orientations of the individual protomers (&gt;3.3 \u00c5; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 3</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goodman et al., 2016</a>). These larger interfamily differences remain apparent when the interaction regions are compared separately, particularly for the EC2\u20133 dimer regions (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#SD5-data\">5</a>). This, in itself, provides a simple explanation for the absence of \u03b1/\u03b2, \u03b1/\u03b3A, \u03b2/\u03b3A, and \u03b2/\u03b3B <i>trans</i> dimers. However, the five <i>trans</i> dimer structures from the \u03b1 and \u03b3B subfamilies (excluding the structurally divergent \u03b3B3) exhibited intermediate structural similarity between the two subfamilies (RMSDs\u00a0~1.9\u20133.4 \u00c5), which was even more apparent when the EC1:EC4 and EC2\u20133:EC2\u20133 interaction regions were compared separately (RMSDs\u00a0&lt;2.2 \u00c5; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#SD5-data\">5</a>).

Both E41 and K338 are conserved in all \u03b3B isoforms so that this salt bridge is likely present in all \u03b3B homodimers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In addition, residue R340, which is also conserved in all \u03b3B isoforms, is positioned so that it could form an additional salt bridge with E41 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In contrast, all \u03b3A isoforms have an arginine or lysine at position 41 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Thus, a putative heterodimer formed between any \u03b3B isoform and any \u03b3A isoform would position a positively charged residue at position 41 in the EC1 domain of the \u03b3A isoform in close proximity to K338 and R340 in the \u03b3B isoform, which would significantly weaken binding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). Remarkably, \u03b1-Pcdhs also conserve a positive charge at position 40 (structurally equivalent to \u03b3B E41), which suggests that putative heterodimers between \u03b1-Pcdhs and \u03b3B-Pcdhs would also generate electrostatic clashes involving the same residues. Thus, the formation of heterodimers between \u03b3B-Pcdhs and both \u03b3A-Pcdhs and \u03b1-Pcdhs appears to be precluded by the conservation of key charged interface residues in EC1 and EC4. A similar mechanism has been shown to determine inter-family specificity in the desmosomal cadherins (<a href=\"#bib14\">Harrison et al., 2016</a>) and intra-family specificity in the case of nectins (<a href=\"#bib15\">Harrison et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Samanta et al., 2012</a>)."

For example, EC2:EC3 interacting residues 111 and 294 in the majority of \u03b3B2 orthologs (not including mouse) are lysine and aspartic acid, which are likely to form a salt bridge in the <i>trans</i> homodimer, whilst in \u03b3B3 and \u03b3B7 residue 111 is a conserved glutamic acid, which in the homodimeric complexes interacts favorably with H/R294 in \u03b3B3 or S294 in \u03b3B7. However hypothetical heterodimers between \u03b3B2 and \u03b3B3 or \u03b3B7 would juxtapose like charges E111 (\u03b3B3/7):D294 (\u03b3B2) and K111 (\u03b3B2):H/R294 (\u03b3B3) which would disfavor the heterophilic interactions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, \u03b3B7 numbering). A similar example of electrostatic compatibility/incompatibility for homophilic/heterophilic pairing can be seen in the EC2:EC3 residues 128 and 257 in \u03b3A isoforms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We also found examples of small/large interacting residue pairs at the interface which showed correlated variations between isoforms such that heterophilic complexes would likely generate steric clashes: For example, EC1:EC4 residues 86 and 369 from \u03b3B isoforms, EC2:EC3 residues 125 and 253 of \u03b3B4 and \u03b3B5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, \u03b3B7 numbering), and EC1:EC4 residues 79 and 340 of \u03b3A8 and \u03b3A9 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Finally, we identified the self-interacting residue 206 of \u03b3A isoforms as a potential specificity-determining residue, providing hydrophobic contacts in some isoforms and polar contacts in others (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In addition to such correlated variations in interacting residues, the logos also revealed conserved isoform-specific residues, which interact with residues that are conserved among \u03b3A or \u03b3B isoforms. Such residues may also contribute to specificity by favoring the homophilic interaction of one isoform over heterophilic interactions with other isoforms."

Here, we have extended this analysis to determine the oligomeric states of multiple \u03b3-Pcdh subfamily members and a representative of the \u03b2-Pcdh subfamily. All \u03b3A EC1\u20136 molecules we tested formed dimers rather than tetramers in solution (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). \u03b3C3<sub>EC1\u20136</sub> was also a dimer in solution, although in this case the isodesmic constant was only 1.5 fold larger than the dimer dissociation constant, indicating non-specific binding. These EC1\u20136 dimers are mediated by an EC1\u20134 (<i>trans</i>) interaction, since all the \u03b3A and \u03b3C3 EC1\u20134 fragments we measured were also dimers in solution (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and the \u03b3A and \u03b3C3 EC2\u20136 or EC3\u20136 fragments were monomers or very weak non-specific dimers (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

In addition, the \u03b3B2, \u03b3B5, and \u03b3B7 EC3\u20136 fragments were dimers in solution (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), confirming the presence of the EC6-dependent <i>cis</i> interaction in solution for these \u03b3B- and \u03b2-Pcdhs, in contrast to the \u03b3A-Pcdhs. Since EC6 is highly conserved within non-C-type Pcdh subfamilies (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>), we assume these results will be general to all mouse \u03b2, \u03b3A, and \u03b3B isoforms."

To address this question, we performed the same assay as in <a href=\"#bib44\">Thu et al. (2014)</a>, which depends on the observation that \u03b1-Pcdhs are not delivered to the cell surface when expressed alone in K562 cells, and are therefore not able to mediate cell adhesion. \u03b1-Pcdhs require co-expression of an EC5\u20136-containing fragment of a \u2018carrier\u2019 Pcdh from another subfamily to reach the cell surface and mediate cell adhesion. We therefore tested whether non-adhesive EC5\u20136 containing fragments of \u03b3A3 and \u03b3A9 were able to deliver Pcdh\u03b14 to the cell surface to mediate cell adhesion. Co-expression of both these isoform fragments with Pcdh\u03b14 resulted in cell aggregation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) indicating that, despite their apparent lack of homophilic <i>cis</i> dimerization, \u03b3A-Pcdhs can interact heterophilically with \u03b1-Pcdhs in <i>cis</i>."

(<b>B</b>)\u00a0Residues mutated to aspartic acid are drawn in space filling representation on the \u03b3B2 EC6 crystal structure. The three mutations that disrupted cell surface delivery of Pcdh\u03b17 are colored red and the mutations that had no effect are colored blue. Glycans observed in the \u03b3B2 crystal structure are shown as white spheres and are found only on one side of the domain\u2014the side opposite to the mutations disrupting cell delivery. (<b>C</b>) Residues predicted by PredUs2.0 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hwang et al., 2016</a>) to be interfacial are drawn in space filling representation on the \u03b3B2 EC6 crystal structure. Predicted interfacial residues occupy only one side of the molecule (composed of A, B, D, and E strands). This is the same side that was indicated by the mutagenesis approach to mediate <i>cis</i> interactions and opposite to the side that contains the glycans. (<b>D</b>) The predicted structure of \u03b3B6 EC6 (based on the \u03b3B2 structure) is shown in surface representation. Black lines frame the face of the molecule containing mutations that disrupt cell surface delivery (labeled in red) and the PredUs2.0 predicted interface residues. Nine surface-exposed residues that show different amino acid compositions between \u03b1-Pcdhs and the carrier \u03b2- and \u03b3-Pcdhs are labeled and colored in orange. (<b>E</b>) Sequence logos of the EC6 domain for \u03b1-Pcdhs and all other alternate Pcdhs (\u03b2, \u03b3A, and \u03b3B). The logos are generated from sequence alignments of the mouse \u03b11\u201312 isoforms and all mouse \u03b2, \u03b3A, and \u03b3B isoforms. Sequence positions that differ between \u03b1-Pcdhs and \u2018carrier\u2019 (\u03b2, \u03b3A, and \u03b3B) Pcdhs are highlighted by orange circles (above the logo); the three mutants that disrupt cell surface delivery are highlighted by red stars (below the logo); and regions predicted by PredUs to be in the interface are marked by blue lines (below the logo). Sequence positions within the face that is likely to contain the <i>cis</i> interface are boxed. Secondary structure elements are annotated above the logo."

Our data suggest that members of different subfamilies fail to bind to each other in <i>trans</i> primarily due to structural differences between the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3A subfamilies. That is, the putative dimers they would form would not exhibit shape compatibility. However, members of the \u03b3B subfamily are sufficiently similar in structure to members of the \u03b1 subfamily that a specificity mechanism is unlikely to be based entirely on shape complementarity. Rather, the sequence and structural analyses presented above show that that EC1:EC4 interface in \u03b3B isoforms will contain salt bridges in the homodimers, whereas the comparable interaction in the inter-subfamily heterodimer would lead to incompatible electrostatic repulsion. In addition, electrostatic clashes involving the same residues appear to preclude formation of heterodimers between \u03b3B-Pcdhs and \u03b3A-Pcdhs. These then are cases where subfamily level specificity is encoded in the EC1:EC4 interface."

As discussed above, some of the specificity-determining interactions are located in the EC1:EC4 interface and some in the EC2:EC3 interface. These findings, as well as those summarized in the previous paragraph contradict a primary conclusion reached by <a href=\"#bib32\">Nicoludis et al.

Both of these mechanisms depend on diverse repertoires of dimeric recognition units.

As we described previously (<a href=\"#bib44\">Thu et al., 2014</a>), this model leads to a limited number of possible distinct cell surface identities and even fewer if the population of <i>cis</i> dimers is not random. In the second case (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), <i>trans</i> binding is suggested to occur between recognition units with a single matched isoform, resulting in the formation of a zipper or chain of Pcdh dimers arrayed between membrane surfaces (<a href=\"#bib44\">Thu et al., 2014</a>); the chain of dimeric recognition units is proposed to be terminated by the presence of a single mismatched isoform (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). This chain termination model leads to the ability to encode a far larger set of distinct cell surface identities (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rubinstein et al., 2015</a>). However, to date there has been no direct observation of oligomeric Pcdhs on cell surfaces. Since it remains unclear what proportion of neurons utilize Pcdhs for self-avoidance, and thus the Pcdh diversity required to avoid inappropriate self-recognition of interacting neurons remains unclear, we cannot currently distinguish between these models."

These dimers form by antiparallel association of the first four EC domains, such that EC1 and EC2 of one molecule interact with EC4 and 3, respectively, of the partner. With this paper there are now representatives from each of the clustered protocadherin subfamilies, enabling a thorough bioinformatic analysis of specificity. They show that the gamma A and B isoforms are distinct subfamilies. In the last part of the paper, they use structural data and mutagenesis to define the cis-dimer interface mediated by EC6, and suggest possible roles of cis-dimers giving rise to higher order assemblies that might contribute to combinatorial specificity amongst the protocadherins. Overall this work represents a significant advance in understanding protocadherin function."

This was based in part on the claim that a general, non-specific hydrophobic interface is present in all isoforms. The present paper gives compelling arguments that there is indeed specificity in this interface, including that they had previously published domain swap experiments demonstrating specificity in the EC1:4 interface. The authors note the presence of a salt bridge in this interface that cannot form in mismatched pair. Could it be that the salt bridge is energetically inconsequential to dimer formation, and the family-wise specificity comes from the lack of electrostatic repulsion?"

It would be helpful to offer some speculation as to the origin of these differences, and also to clarify if the alternative 1-4 interaction in the gammaA8 lattice is distinct. Do the authors think that the EC1:4 interface is a transient interaction rather than stable?"

They also argue that the previous \u03b3-B3 structure (Nicoludis, 2016) is non-native (or partly artefactual). I found both of these to be convincing given their data. For the pairs/groups of residues they focus as specificity determinants (such as R340-E41-K338), the structure based data is very suggestive, yet all such claims would have benefited from some experimental data (such as some sort of swap mutagenesis). Such risky experiments need not be performed for a revision. Similar claims on structural bases for binding preferences within classes, or homophilic vs. heterophilic are also strongly suggestive, although always hard to prove."

While I am convinced, I believe a more direct assay would put to rest most concerns readers have \u2013 clearly not easy to do, and not necessary for a possible revision. One specific and mild concern I had here is the folding of some of the mutants tested for identifying the cis interface, which never made it to the cell surface (a common outcome for misfolded proteins), and they couldn't express two of these three mutants for AUC experiments either (another sign of misfolding). In other words, lack of surface trafficking might represent not lack of cis binding but also misfolding of the mutants."

This was based in part on the claim that a general, non-specific hydrophobic interface is present in all isoforms. The present paper gives compelling arguments that there is indeed specificity in this interface, including that they had previously published domain swap experiments demonstrating specificity in the EC1:4 interface. The authors note the presence of a salt bridge in this interface that cannot form in mismatched pair. Could it be that the salt bridge is energetically inconsequential to dimer formation, and the family-wise specificity comes from the lack of electrostatic repulsion?</i> "

There is not an obvious correlation with crystallization conditions, although it is interesting that the crystals with isopropanol show this separation (as well as one copy in the gammaA1 structure, which is at the lowest pH of those that show any dimerization). It would be helpful to offer some speculation as to the origin of these differences, and also to clarify if the alternative 1-4 interaction in the gammaA8 lattice is distinct. Do the authors think that the EC1:4 interface is a transient interaction rather than stable?</i> "

With respect to the differences among EC1:EC4 interactions in \u03b3A-Pcdhs, we have not yet been able to assign the determinants responsible for the apparent plasticity of the EC1:EC4 interactions in \u03b3A-Pcdhs. However, the fact that we observe alternate arrangements only for \u03b3A-Pcdhs suggests that this is related to a property of the \u03b3A subfamily. We have now made it clear that, despite the alternate arrangements observed crystallographically, AUC experiments with \u03b3A1 and \u03b3A4 show that the presence of all four domains is required for binding (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). While there is clear malleability of the EC1:EC4 interaction in the \u03b3A subfamily, we have no evidence that this interaction is transient."

However, all other Pcdh subfamilies \u2013 which did not display such plasticity \u2013 have low RMSDs in comparisons between family members. This is part of the reason why RMSD identifies \u03b3B3 as an outlier within the \u03b3B subfamily. Importantly, it is the combination of this observation, along with the apparent disruption of the EC2:EC3 interface, which identifies \u03b3B3 as an outlying structure.
