Here, we report the step-wise differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) (embryonic and induced) into lung organoids. By manipulating developmental signaling pathways hPSCs generate ventral-anterior foregut spheroids, which are then expanded into human lung organoids (HLOs). HLOs consist of epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of the lung, organized with structural features similar to the native lung. HLOs possess upper airway-like epithelium with basal cells and immature ciliated cells surrounded by smooth muscle and myofibroblasts as well as an alveolar-like domain with appropriate cell types. Using RNA-sequencing, we show that HLOs are remarkably similar to human fetal lung based on global transcriptional profiles, suggesting that HLOs are an excellent model to study human lung development, maturation and disease."

Here, we report the step-wise differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) (embryonic and induced) into lung organoids. By manipulating developmental signaling pathways hPSCs generate ventral-anterior foregut spheroids, which are then expanded into human lung organoids (HLOs). HLOs consist of epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of the lung, organized with structural features similar to the native lung. HLOs possess upper airway-like epithelium with basal cells and immature ciliated cells surrounded by smooth muscle and myofibroblasts as well as an alveolar-like domain with appropriate cell types. Using RNA-sequencing, we show that HLOs are remarkably similar to human fetal lung based on global transcriptional profiles, suggesting that HLOs are an excellent model to study human lung development, maturation and disease."

Building on these previous studies, we show that simultaneous stimulation of WNT and FGF signaling while inhibiting BMP/TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways in hPSC-derived endoderm cultures prevents intestinal lineage commitment, and instead, favors a SOX2+ anterior foregut fate while also robustly generating SOX2+ anterior foregut 3D spheroid structures."

In the mouse, high levels of Fgf signaling have been shown to induce Shh expression in the lung endoderm (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hebrok et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Morrisey and Hogan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Rankin and Zorn, 2014</a>) which is accompanied by induction of the Nkx2.1+ lung progenitor field (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hebrok et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Serls, 2004</a>). Shh then signals from the endoderm to the mesoderm, and mutations in <i>Shh, Gli2</i> or <i>Gli3</i> lead to perturbed lung development, with <i>Gli2/Gli3</i> double knockout mice showing lung agenesis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bellusci et al., 1997a</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Motoyama et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2004</a>). Our results demonstrate that FGF2 induces NKX2.1, PAX8, and SHH in human foregut endoderm cultures. By using pharmacological inhibitors of FGF and HH signaling we demonstrate that SHH is required for NKX2.1 expression downstream of FGF2, and that FGF2 also induces PAX8 independently of HH signaling. These observations suggest a paradigm where FGF<sup>Lo</sup>/HH<sup>Hi</sup> conditions preferentially induce PAX8<sup>Lo</sup>/NKX2.1<sup>Hi</sup> lung progenitors and FGF<sup>Hi</sup>/HH<sup>Lo</sup> conditions favor a PAX8<sup>Hi</sup>/NKX2.1<sup>Lo</sup> fate. Given that Pax8 is required for thyroid development, we focused on defining the most robust conditions to induce NKX2.1 while minimizing PAX8 expression (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kimura et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mansouri et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Yuan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Vilain et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kusakabe et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Carr\u00e9 et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Narumi et al., 2012</a>). By applying HH<sup>Hi</sup> conditions during generation of foregut spheroids we were able to enhance NKX2.1 expression in foregut spheroids and subsequently expand spheroids in media containing FGF10, allowing them to grow into organoids. Organoids persisted in culture for over 100 days and developed well-organized proximal-like airway epithelial structures that included many cell types found in the proximal lung epithelium, including basal and ciliated cells along with rare club cells. Moreover, proximal airway structures were often surrounded by smooth muscle actin (SMA) positive mesenchymal tissue. Organoids also possessed distal-like epithelial cells that co-expressed progenitor markers, SFTPC/SOX9 and HOPX/SOX9, consistent with early bipotent alveolar progenitor cells seen in mice (<a href=\"#bib20\">Desai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Treutlein et al., 2014</a>). To support the idea that organoids may be more similar to a developing lung with abundant progenitor cells, we used RNA-sequencing to compare the global transcriptional profile of organoids to the human fetal and adult lung, undifferentiated hESCs and definitive endoderm. Principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering and Spearman's correlation all show that organoids have striking similarity to the human fetal lung."

We have recently demonstrated that inhibition of BMP signaling during intestinal lineage induction with WNT and FGF ligands is sufficient to inhibit intestinal CDX2 and induce SOX2+ posterior foregut spheroids capable of giving rise to human gastric (antral) organoids (<a href=\"#bib48\">McCracken et al., 2014</a>). Given that the lung is derived from the anterior foregut, we sought to define conditions to generate ventral anterior foregut spheroids. To do this, we tested if dual inhibition of BMP and TGF\u03b2 was able to anteriorize cultures, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib27\">Green et al., 2011</a>). We treated hESCs with ActivinA (100 ng/ml) for 4 days to induce endoderm, followed by 4 days of Noggin (NOG, 200 ng/ml) and the small molecule TGF\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542 (SB, 10 \u00b5M). We confirmed that these conditions were able to induce robust mRNA and protein expression of SOX2, which co-expressed the endodermal marker FOXA2, while repressing the intestinal lineage marker CDX2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). QRT-PCR analysis also showed that compared to controls (in which endoderm was induced but was not exposed to NOG/SB), exposure to NOG/SB robustly induced ventral anterior foregut genes <i>NKX2.1</i> and <i>PAX8</i>, while the posterior foregut transcript, <i>PDX1</i> was reduced. <i>HHEX</i>, which is expressed in the developing liver, biliary system and thyroid, but is absent from the lung primordium, remained unchanged (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Given that NKX2.1 is expressed in the lung and thyroid primordium, and PAX8 is expressed in the thyroid primordium, these results suggest that 4 day ActivinA treatment followed by a 4 day NOG/SB treatment biases the cultures towards ventral-anterior foregut lineages."

Based on our results in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>, we hypothesized that combining FGF, Chir99021, NOG and SB would result in the generation of SOX2+ ventral-anterior foregut spheroids. To test this, we generated endoderm (4 days ACTA) and added no growth factors (Endoderm controls) or NOG, SB, FGF4, and Chir99021 (NOG/SB/F/Ch) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Addition of all four factors resulted in the generation of 3-dimensional SOX2+, CDX2\u2212 spheroids (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). SOX2+ spheroids also expressed the endodermal protein FOXA2, and were epithelial, co-expressing E-Cadherin (ECAD) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition to SOX2, spheroids exhibited higher mRNA expression of anterior foregut lineage markers <i>NKX2.1</i> and <i>PAX8</i> compared to endoderm controls, suggesting that they are ventral-anterior foregut spheroids (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), however, immunofluorescence revealed that levels of NKX2.1 protein were just above the detection threshold (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Spheroids also possess a minor population of cells that are mesodermal in origin staining positive for Vimentin protein (VIM) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Given that neural tissues also express NKX2.1, PAX8, SOX2, and FOXA2, and that neural induction protocols use dual BMP and TGF\u03b2 inhibition, we wanted to exclude the possibility that spheroids were neural in nature. To do this, we generated endoderm control cultures, foregut spheroids (ActivinA followed by NOG/SB/F/Ch), and induced neural tissue by adding NOG/SB to hESC cultures that were not treated with ActivinA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chambers et al., 2009</a>). By examining induction of the neural markers <i>NESTIN, SOX1,</i> and <i>PAX6</i>, we confirmed that these transcripts were highly induced in dual NOG/SB neural cultures, but were low in ventral foregut spheroid cultures. In contrast, <i>FOXA2</i>, which is expressed in the foregut (<a href=\"#bib51\">Monaghan et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ang and Rossant, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">D'Amour et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kroon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Si-Tayeb et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">DeLaForest et al., 2011</a>) and in some neural tissues (<a href=\"#bib70\"><a href=\"#bib74\">Stott et al., 2013</a>), had high expression in ventral foregut spheroids, but was significantly reduced in dual NOG/SB neural conditions (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest spheroids are indeed foregut, and not of neural origin.</a>"

                                "text": "Many signaling pathways are important for lung induction and development (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib50\">Min et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Weaver et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Morrisey and Hogan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Rankin and Zorn, 2014</a>). High levels of Fgf signaling have been shown to induce Shh and Nkx2.1 expression in the foregut endoderm in mice (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hebrok et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Serls, 2004</a>); furthermore, Gli2/3 null mouse embryos fail to form lungs (<a href=\"#bib54\">Motoyama et al., 1998</a>) and Hh signaling is important for lung mesenchyme proliferation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bellusci et al., 1997a</a>). These data confirm that Fgf and Hh signaling are critical for lung specification and ligands from both signaling pathways have been applied to hPSC derived lung lineages in 2D cultures (<a href=\"#bib87\">Wong et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Huang et al., 2013</a>). In our cultures we have reported that approximately 85\u201395% of cells are endoderm, but a portion of the remaining cells are mesodermal and this small mesodermal population is maintained in the spheroids and organoids (<a href=\"#bib72\">Spence et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">McCracken et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Therefore, based on mouse and hPSC studies, we hypothesized that FGF and/or HH signaling would induce an NKX2.1+ lung lineage in anterior foregut endoderm. To test our hypothesis we initially focused on adherent endoderm monolayer cultures to optimize induction conditions. Cultures were treated for 4 days with ActivinA followed by an additional 4 days with NOG/SB (referred to as Foregut). Controls consisted of ActivinA treatment only followed by no additional growth factors (Endoderm controls), or ActivinA followed by NOG/SB, followed by no additional factors (Foregut controls). All experimental groups were compared to both endoderm and foregut controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We first tested the ability of FGF2 to induce <i>SHH</i>, <i>NKX2.1</i> and <i>PAX8</i> by exposing foregut cultures to low and high concentrations of FGF2 (50, 500 ng/ml) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We observed a robust concentration dependent increase in <i>SHH</i> and <i>PAX8</i> mRNA expression compared to foregut or endoderm controls, and a modest increase of <i>NKX2.1</i> expression at the highest dose of FGF2 (500 ng/ml) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We also observed that dual NOG/SB inhibition in endoderm cultures induced robust <i>NKX2.1</i> and <i>PAX8</i> expression without adding FGF2 (<a href=\"#fig1 fig2\">Figures 1B, 2A</a>). Thus, we wanted to determine if <i>NKX2.1</i> expression in foregut cultures was due to endogenous FGF and/or HH signaling. To test this, we inhibited the FGF or HH pathway with small molecules SU5402 (SU, 10 \u00b5m) and Sant-2 (10 \u00b5m) respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013C</a>). Treating foregut cultures with the FGF inhibitor SU caused a significant, robust reduction in <i>PAX8</i> and a modest reduction in <i>SHH</i>, while <i>NKX2.1</i> expression was unchanged compared to foregut controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Conversely, inhibition of HH signaling caused a significant reduction in <i>NKX2.1</i> expression, but not <i>PAX8</i> compared to untreated foregut<i>.</i> When FGF2 was added to the cultures, we observed a modest increase in <i>NKX2.1</i> expression, and when FGF was added along with Sant-2, <i>NKX2.1</i> expression was significantly reduced (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Together our results suggest a hierarchy where FGF is upstream of SHH and PAX8, and where SHH is upstream of NKX2.1. To test if HH signaling was able to induce NKX2.1 in foregut cultures, we added the Smoothened agonist, SAG (1 \u00b5M) to foregut cultures. The addition of SAG induced a 6.5-fold increase of <i>NKX2.1</i> expression above foregut controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). However, SAG alone did not reduce <i>PAX8</i> expression."

Consistent with the important roles of FGF signaling in lung growth and branching morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hebrok et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Min et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Weaver et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abler et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Morrisey and Hogan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Rankin and Zorn, 2014</a>), we found that conditions where FGF inhibition was used led to a reduction of epithelial tissue relative to mesenchymal tissue, which could be due to a loss of epithelium or an overgrowth of mesenchyme; this suggests that endogenous FGF signaling is necessary to maintain the epithelial tissue in 3D cultures (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, we also tested several conditions that stimulated HH signaling using SAG only, without FGF inhibition. We found that the most efficient method to enhance NKX2.1 expression was by adding SAG during the foregut spheroid phase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Comparing foregut spheroids (NOG/SB/F/Ch) with those treated with SAG (NOG/SB/F/Ch/SAG), we observed a substantial decrease in <i>SOX2</i> expression compared to NOG/SB/F/Ch spheroids and a significant increase in <i>NKX2.1</i> mRNA. Additionally, nuclear NKX2.1 protein expression was found in ECAD+ epithelium which co-expressed endoderm epithelial markers FOXA2 and SOX2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Interestingly, during lung specification in mice, the gut tube initially expresses Sox2 throughout the endoderm, but Sox2 is down-regulated in the lung field during lung specification and Nkx2.1 induction (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hebrok et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Serls, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Domyan et al., 2011</a>). Thus, concomitant down-regulation of <i>SOX2</i> and increased <i>NKX2.1</i> observed in SAG treated foregut spheroids is consistent with early transcriptional changes that occur during lung specification in mice."

Others have demonstrated that robust differentiation of multi-ciliated cells from hPSCs require modified culture conditions to promote differentiation of functional cell types (<a href=\"#bib24\">Firth et al., 2014</a>). Thus, it is possible that the HLO environment, such as Matrigel or media rich in FGF10, does not promote terminal differentiation of all cell types. In order to alter the HLO environment, we seeded NOG/SB/F/Ch/SAG foregut spheroids onto an acellular human lung matrix (<a href=\"#bib7\">Booth et al., 2012</a>). Spheroids seeded on slices of acellular lung matrix predominantly gave rise to proximal airway-like structures in which stereotypical tufts of ACTTUB positive ciliated structures on the apical surface of cells were observed facing into a lumen.

                                "text": "Recently, there have been major advances in mice toward defining a bipotent alveolar progenitor population during the late fetal/early neonatal period (<a href=\"#bib20\">Desai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Treutlein et al., 2014</a>), and this work has highlighted the fact that many markers previously considered terminal differentiation markers are co-expressed in the bipotent progenitors. Specifically, the AECII marker SftpC and AECI marker Hopx can be co-expressed in a bipotent progenitor before becoming committed to one lineage or the other. Moreover, we have shown that Sox9 marks an early progenitor population in the developing mouse lung and Sox9 also marks the bipotent progenitor in late fetal life (<a href=\"#bib67\">Rockich et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Treutlein et al., 2014</a>). In HLOs grown in prolonged culture (&gt;2 months), we observed that AECII (SFTPC, SFTPB) and AECI (PDPN, HOPX) cell-type markers were present (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>). However, we also observed that <i>SFTPC</i> levels were very low (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), and that SFTPB+ cells were rare (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This suggested that the distal airway cells present in HLOs might be a progenitor-like population. To test this possibility, we co-stained SFTPC (AECII) or HOPX (AECI) with SOX9 and found abundant SFTPC/SOX9 and HOPX/SOX9 double positive cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Co-staining in serial sections suggests that SFTPC/SOX9 double positive cells are also NKX2.1+ (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast these co-expressing cells were not found in the adult human lung (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Although rare, the few SFTPB+ observed in HLOs resemble AECII cells seen in the adult human lung, and PDPN+ cells resembled the elongated AECI cells in the human lung (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>). In order to improve confidence that cells expressing AECII markers are AECII cells, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to determine if HLOs possessed cells containing lamellar bodies, which are necessary for surfactant protein trafficking and secretion (<a href=\"#bib68\">Schmitz and M\u00fcller, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Stahlman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Weaver et al., 2002</a>). Using TEM, we observed lamellar bodies both in cells within HLOs, and in open spaces between cells, indicating that lamellar bodies are being secreted (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Taken together, our data suggests that HLOs predominantly possess undifferentiated alveolar progenitor cells with rare differentiated AECI and AECII cells interspersed throughout the distal-like tissue."

Moreover, the majority of the distal-like epithelium expresses bipotent progenitor markers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In order to directly address the maturity of HLOs, we conducted RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) on HLOs (n = 6; 3 D65 HLOs, 3 D110 HLOs), on undifferentiated hESCs and on definitive endoderm. We also took advantage of publicly available RNAseq datasets for human fetal lung representing a range of gestational stages, and for adult human lung (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

Thus, HLOs allow one to address questions regarding spatial tissue organization and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Since HLOs form organized structures that resemble bronchi and bronchioles with adjacent mesenchyme, these complex, organized tissues may allow exploration, for example, of airway remodeling after injury. Moreover, the spatial arrangement of specific cell types will be critical to study proximal airway dynamics during homeostasis and injury. For example, the location of P63+ cells adjacent to FOXJ1+ cells in the HLOs will be necessary to study basal cell differentiation into different proximal airway cell types during homeostasis or after injury. In addition to tissue morphology and structure during prolonged culture, the HLOs consist of both epithelium and mesenchyme in early cultures that are maintained over time. Since lung development requires extensive cross talk between the epithelium and mesenchyme in order to regulate developmental processes, proliferation and differentiation, HLOs may be an ideal in vitro system to study these complex tissue\u2013tissue interactions."

Two groups have defined a bipotent progenitor population in the embryonic/neonatal lung that gives rise to both AECI and AECII cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Desai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Treutlein et al., 2014</a>). These bipotent cells express the distal progenitor marker Sox9 along with differentiation markers of AECI and AECII cells, including SftpC, HopX, and Pdpn. We demonstrate that HLOs expressed both AECI and II markers; however, the majority of these cells also expressed SOX9 suggesting that the majority of the distal epithelium is comprised of bipotent progenitors. Thus, HLOs will allow us to gain insight into this bipotent population, explore how bipotent progenitors are regulated, and define the mechanisms of how fate-decisions are made as terminal differentiation occurs."

That is, while they possess committed lineage-specific cell types, the cells may not exhibit fully matured adult-like function (<a href=\"#bib48\">McCracken et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Watson et al., 2014</a>). This is also the case for pancreatic \u03b2-like cells and hepatocyte-like cells generated in vitro (<a href=\"#bib70\">Si-Tayeb et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hrvatin et al., 2014</a>). Alternatively, the progenitor state may reflect the high levels of FGF10 in the culture media, since FGF10 is known to maintain progenitor cells in the lung (<a href=\"#bib62\">Ramasamy et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nyeng et al., 2008</a>). Given that HLOs are similar to human fetal lung, this tissue is an ideal model to study lung maturation of both the proximal and distal epithelium along with epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in a developmental context."

                        "text": "While the multi-lineage, multi-cellular composition of HLOs is a major advantage, one of the caveats to this system is that HLOs do not appear to undergo <i>bona fide</i> branching morphogenesis or possess transitional zones found in the adult lung, such as the bronchioalveolar ductal junction (BADJ). The HLOs possess proximal SOX2+ domain and distal SOX9+ domains observed during branching morphogenesis, but this regionalization occurs without setting up the stereotyped branching pattern. This may be due to the fact that the organoids are surrounded by media supplemented with FGF10 compared to the in vivo situation where FGF10 is expressed in a dynamic, spatially restricted manner in the distal mesenchyme (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bellusci et al., 1997b</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nyeng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abler et al., 2009</a>). However, it has recently been demonstrated that localized expression FGF10 is not required for branching (<a href=\"#bib80\">Volckaert et al., 2013</a>), so this may not explain the lack of branching. Alternatively, similar to other endoderm-derived organoid models, HLOs lack several components of the native organ, including immune cells, vasculature, and innervation. Thus, it is possible that cellular inputs important for branching morphogenesis are missing from HLOs. Indeed, recent reports have shown that innervation is required for proper branching (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bower et al., 2014</a>), and while vasculature may not be important for lung branching (<a href=\"#bib28\">Havrilak and Shannon, 2015</a>), others have shown the vascular endothelium is required to induce a branching-like program of isolated airway epithelium in 3D cultures (<a href=\"#bib25\">Franzd\u00f3ttir et al., 2010</a>). Lastly, the microenvironment is essential for branching morphogenesis to occur including dynamic changes in the extracellular matrix around branching lung bud tips where the ECM is constantly changing and interacting with the cytoskeleton of the branching epithelium in order to facilitate cell movement and branching bifurcations (<a href=\"#bib52\">Moore et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kim and Nelson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wan et al., 2013</a>). It is possible that in the future, co-culture with additional cellular inputs may prove to enhance HLO branching."

HLOs possess both mesenchymal and epithelial lineages, as well as organized proximal airway structures with multiple cell types and surrounded by mesenchyme. HLOs also possess distal epithelial cells that are reminiscent of a bipotent alveolar progenitor cell recently described in mice which is likely a reflection of the similarities of HLOs to the human fetal lung. We believe that HLOs will be an excellent new human system to model lung differentiation, homeostasis and disease in vitro."

All sequences were deposited in the EMBL-EBI ArrayExpress database using Annotare 2.0 and are catalogued under the accession number E-MTAB-3339 for the HLOs and E-MTAB-3158 for SC and DE. The University of Michigan Bioinformatics Core obtained the reads files and concatenated those into a single \u2018.fastq\u2019 file for each sample. The Bioinformatics Core also downloaded reads files from EBI-AE database (Adult lung Samples) and NCBI-GEO (SRA) database (Fetal lung samples) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). The quality of the raw reads data for each sample was evaluated using FastQC (version 0.10.1) to identify features of the data that may indicate quality problems (e.g., low quality scores, over-represented sequences, inappropriate GC content, etc). Initial QC report indicated over-representation of Illumina adapter sequences in samples from EBI-AE data set and NCBI-GEO data set. Adapter sequences were trimmed from the reads using Cutadapt (version 0.9.5) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2014a</a>). Briefly, reads were aligned to the reference transcriptome (UCSC hg19) using TopHat (version 2.0.9) and Bowtie (version 2.1.0.0) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Langmead et al., 2009</a>). Cufflinks/CuffNorm (version 2.2.1) was used for expression quantitation and differential expression analysis (<a href=\"#bib77\">Trapnell et al., 2012</a>), using UCSC hg19.fa as the reference genome sequence and UCSC hg19.gtf as the reference transcriptome annotation. For this analysis, we used parameter settings: \u2018\u2013multi-read-correct\u2019 to adjust expression calculations for reads that map in more than one locus, as well as \u2018\u2013compatible-hits-norm\u2019 and \u2018\u2013upper-quartile \u2013norm\u2019 for normalization of expression values. Normalized FPKM tables were generated using the CuffNorm function found in Cufflinks. Transcriptional quantitation analysis in Cufflinks was conducted using the 64-bit Debian Linux stable version 7.8 (\u2018Wheezy\u2019) platform. The complete FPKM matrix, containing frequency counts for all 24,010 genes contained in the reference genome for all 23 RNAseq samples, was evaluated using unscaled principle component analysis (PCA) to visualize and quantify multi-dimensional variation between samples (<a href=\"#bib65\">Ringn\u00e9r, 2008</a>). Of the 24,010 genes annotated in the reference genome, 2815 (11.7%) were not detected in the RNAseq analysis of any of the 23 samples. Principle components were calculated using the function \u2018prcomp\u2019 found in the R (version 3.1.2) statistical programming language (<a href=\"http://www.R-project.org/\">http://www.R-project.org/</a>) and plotted using the R package \u2018ggplot2\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib86\">Wickham, 2009</a>). Hierarchical cluster analysis based on the Canberra distance (<a href=\"#bib22\">Eisen et al., 1998</a>) between FPKM vectors was used to classify discrete RNAseq samples according to the degree of total transcriptional dissimilarity indicated by the normalized FPKM values. Bootstrap analysis was used to assess the uncertainty in the assigned hierarchical clustering relationships. 10,000 bootstraping iterations were generated by repeatedly randomly sampling the FPKM dataset. The bootstrap probability (BP) of a cluster is defined as the frequency of a given relationship among the bootstrap replicates. Multiscale bootstrap resampling was used to calculate an approximately unbiased (AU) p-value for a given relationship, with AU &gt; 95 indicating a high degree of statistical significance. Analyses were conducted using R package \u2018pvclust\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib75\">Suzuki and Shimodaira, 2006</a>). Spearman correlation was applied as an additional assessment of the cumulative degree of correlation among RNAseq datasets. In addition, we computed Spearman rank correlation coefficients (\u03c1) in a pairwise manner among all 23 RNAseq samples using the complete normalized FPKM data. The Spearman coefficients were plotted as a heatmap using the function \u2018heatmap.2\u2019 in the R package \u2018gplots\u2019 (<a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/package=gplots\">http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gplots</a>).

However, at this time, all of these possibilities are pure speculation.

When we inhibit HH with a small molecule, Sant-2, NKX2.1 expression is reduced. However, we still do not understand the mechanism by which this happens. One strong possibility is that HH signaling enhances mesenchymal proliferation and/or survival in HLOs, thus increasing important reciprocal signaling events between the two populations.
