Our ability to interpret this molecular fossil record is constrained by ignorance of the function of their molecular antecedents. To gain insight into the meaning of 2-methylhopanes, we quantified the dominant (des)methylated hopanoid species in the membranes of the model hopanoid-producing bacterium <i>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</i> TIE-1. Fluorescence polarization studies of small unilamellar vesicles revealed that hopanoid 2-methylation specifically renders native bacterial membranes more rigid at concentrations that are relevant in vivo. That hopanoids differentially modify native membrane rigidity as a function of their methylation state indicates that methylation itself promotes fitness under stress. Moreover, knowing the in vivo (2Me)-hopanoid concentration range in different cell membranes, and appreciating that (2Me)-hopanoids' biophysical effects are tuned by the lipid environment, permits the design of more relevant in vitro experiments to study their physiological functions."

Millions of years ago, several periods occurred where the Earth's oceans lost almost all of their oxygen; this likely placed all life on Earth under great stress. A greater proportion of the hopanes found in rocks formed during those periods are methylated than those seen in rocks from other time periods.

This makes the membrane more rigid, and the extent of this stiffening depends on the length of the 2-methylated hopanoid and on the other molecules that are present in the membrane. A more rigid membrane would protect the bacteria more in times of stress; therefore, rock layers containing an increased amount of 2-methylhopane are likely to indicate times when the bacteria living at that time were under a great deal of stress."

The composition of lipids in cell membranes varies significantly and the basic biophysical properties of membranes, such as rigidity and permeability, can be adjusted based on growth conditions and environmental stressors (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lipowsky and Sackmann, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Los and Murata, 2004</a>; Neubauer et al., 2014). One well-studied example is cholesterol in eukaryotic membranes. This essential sterol plays diverse roles in maintaining membrane structural integrity, modifying membrane rigidity, serving as a biosynthetic precursor for steroid hormones, vitamin D, and bile acids, or acting as a protein modifier for signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hanukoglu, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Gallet, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Song et al., 2014</a>). In addition to their important biological functions, lipids are of interest because they are more geostable than other biomolecules. For example, hopanoid molecular fossils, \u2018hopanes\u2019, date back over a billion years (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brocks et al., 2005</a>) and are so abundant that the global stock of hopanoids that can be extracted from sedimentary rocks is estimated to be 10<sup>13</sup> or 10<sup>14</sup> tons, more than the estimated 10<sup>12</sup> tons of organic carbon in all living organisms (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ourisson et al., 1984</a>). In contrast to steroids, hopanoids are a less well studied but evolutionarily significant and chemically diverse class of lipids that are thought to be sterol surrogates in bacteria (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rohmer et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ourisson et al., 1987</a>)."

But being able to confidently interpret the meaning of any ancient molecular fossil poses considerable challenges. First, we must be able to identify potential sources for these compounds, demanding unambiguous chemical parity between modern and ancient structures. Once this is achieved, understanding whether particular environmental conditions regulate the production of specific hopanoid variants becomes important. But arguably, the most critical goal in advancing our understanding of ancient lipids is being able to identify specific biological functions for their counterparts in cells today. Myriad hopanoid structures are known to exist (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ourisson et al., 1984</a>), yet we only poorly understand the significance of this chemical diversity. For meaningful linkages to be made between modern compounds and ancient biomarkers, we must (1) study those hopanoids that leave a specific trace in sedimentary rocks (e.g., their chemical modifications are geostable), (2) identify their in vivo function(s), and (3) evaluate whether the roles played by these lipids in modern organisms have been conserved over the course of evolution."

For example, studies using hopanoid-deficient mutants have shown that hopanoids promote resistance to antibiotics, detergents, extreme pH, and high osmolarity (<a href=\"#bib56\">Welander et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sa\u0301enz, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schmerk et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Malott et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kulkarni et al., 2013</a>). Biophysical studies using mixtures of hopanoids and model lipids have demonstrated that, like cholesterol, bacteriohopanetetrol cyclitol ether can condense membranes at high temperatures but fluidize membranes at low temperatures (<a href=\"#bib39\">Poralla et al., 1980</a>). Similarly, bacteriohopanetetrol (BHT) and bacteriohopanemonol can condense model membranes, and diplopterol (Dip) can form liquid ordered microdomains (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kannenberg et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Nagumo et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ourisson and Rohmer, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sa\u0301enz et al., 2012</a>). A recent molecular modeling study pointed out different behaviors between Dip and BHT in their specific location within lipid bilayers and their capacity to condense membranes, suggesting complex roles of hopanoids due to their structural diversity (<a href=\"#bib38\">Poger and Mark, 2013</a>). These biophysical studies have provided insights into the physical capabilities of these hopanoids. However, whether hopanoids play the same roles in vivo has been unclear due to the differences in lipid composition and concentration between model and cellular membranes."

For a time, it was thought that 2Me-hopanes were biomarkers of cyanobacteria, and hence the process of oxygenic photosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib51\">Summons et al., 1999</a>), but we now know this not to be the case (<a href=\"#bib54\">Welander et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ricci et al., 2015</a>). Intriguingly, spikes in the C<sub>30</sub> 2Me-hopane index (ratio of methylated short hopanes to total short hopanes) through geologic time are correlated with episodes of oceanic anoxic events (OAEs), which are thought to have imposed heightened stress on the biosphere (<a href=\"#bib17\">Knoll et al., 2007</a>)."

Recent data suggest this phenotypic silence results from changes to the lipidome that compensate for the loss of 2Me-hopanoids (unpublished).

This experimental foundation set the stage for what we now report: in vitro membrane studies to examine how 2Me-hopanoids affect membrane rigidity in the context of different lipid environments of relevance to the cell. Our finding that hopanoid methylation enhances membrane rigidity supports the interpretation that past intervals of heightened 2Me-hopane abundance record a history of stress."

As expected, at higher temperature, the cell membrane became less rigid across all strains. At 25\u00b0C, the \u0394<i>shc</i> mutant, which lacks all hopanoids, had the least rigid membrane. This could be caused by both the absence of hopanoids and the accumulation of the hopanoid biosynthetic precursor, squalene. The result is also consistent with the observation that in model lipid vesicles, hopanoids make the membrane more rigid (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kannenberg et al., 1985</a>). Interestingly, the production of only short-chain hopanoids (\u0394<i>hpnH</i>) is sufficient to recover the rigidity level close to that of the WT. However, when an adenosine molecule is attached to short hopanoids and accumulates in the \u0394<i>hpnG</i> mutant, rigidity decreases to \u0394<i>shc</i> levels. Furthermore, in \u0394<i>hpnN</i> where hopanoids are unable to be transported to the outer membrane (<a href=\"#bib6\">Doughty et al., 2011</a>), membrane rigidity is similar to \u0394<i>hpnG</i>. These results have two implications. First, the hydrophobic reporter dye we used for fluorescence polarization measurements, diphenyl hexatriene (DPH), reflects mostly the rigidity of the outer membrane. Second, the types of hopanoids and their respective localization between the inner and outer membranes directly impact membrane rigidity."

We can distinguish between these two scenarios by measuring membrane rigidity using vesicles made of model lipids and purified hopanoids.

The yields of the total lipid extract (TLE) from the lyophilized fractionated membranes were \u223c12\u201315% from the IM and \u223c5% for the OM.

Such calibration was recently shown to be essential for accurate hopanoid quantification (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wu et al., 2015</a>). Using this approach, the exact wt% of each hopanoid in TLE was obtained. However, to put the numbers in context and compare the value in mol%, we assumed the average molecular weight of the total lipids is 786 g/mol, the same as dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and <i>E. coli</i> polar lipid extract (PLE). Because we could only confidently quantify (2Me)-Dip and (2Me)-BHT, we focused our analyses on these four hopanoids. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> shows the hopanoid quantification results. In both WT and \u0394<i>hpnP</i>, each type of hopanoid is enriched in the OM compared to the IM. The total of these four hopanoids in the IM is \u223c2.6 mol% of TLE, whereas in the OM, the value can reach 8\u201311 mol%. For individual hopanoids in WT, the mol% in IM and OM are 1% and 2% for Dip, 1% and 2.4% for 2Me-Dip, 0.4% and 3.4% for BHT, and 0.1% and 0.3% for 2Me-BHT, respectively.

Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) are commonly used for such measurements because it is straightforward to control their lipid composition (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hope et al., 1985</a>). We used fluorescence polarization to measure the fluorescence of DPH, a reporter dye, in the presence of model lipids and purified hopanoids. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> shows how the membrane rigidity of model lipids, DOPC and <i>E. coli</i> PLE, responds to the presence of cholesterol, squalene, (2Me)-Dip, and (2Me)-BHT. Because the total hopanoids in cell membranes are \u223c10 mol% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), we varied the concentration of hopanoids between 5 and 20 mol% in SUVs, which our quantification results suggest are physiologically relevant concentrations. Starting with the simplest single lipid background, DOPC, the addition of cholesterol increases membrane rigidity and the magnitude of change is proportional to the amounts of cholesterol added (black line, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This observation is consistent with the literature and validates our technical approach (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vanblitterswijk et al., 1987</a>). Interestingly, the addition of the hopanoid precursor, squalene, has the opposite effect as cholesterol and makes the membrane less rigid in a concentration-dependent fashion (magenta line, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). However, when Dip is added, the membrane rigidity is unaffected (blue line, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Surprisingly, given the structural similarity between cholesterol and Dip, Dip does not seem to rigidify DOPC as extensively as does cholesterol. However, when Dip is further processed by the cell to produce BHT, it rigidifies DOPC vesicles in the same manner as cholesterol (red line, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

Among the identified phospholipids, the IM in WT and \u0394<i>hpnP</i> has \u223c50%, \u223c36%, and \u223c12\u201314% of PC, PE, and PG, respectively, whereas the OM in WT and \u0394<i>hpnP</i> has \u223c56\u201358%, \u223c30\u201333%, and \u223c11\u201312% of PC, PE, and PG, respectively. However, when we calculate the total identified phospholipid amount, it only accounts for \u223c26\u201334 wt% of the original TLE samples (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>). This low value could be due to (1) low solubility of cardiolipins and other unidentifiable lipids in LC-MS, (2) differences in the ionization efficiency of the phospholipids with different chain length or saturation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Myers et al., 2011</a>), and (3) the ionization suppression effects occur from co-eluting lipids (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brugger et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Furey et al., 2013</a>). Nevertheless, the average molecular weight of the phospholipids without cardiolipin is 738 g/mol. Considering the higher molecular weight of cardiolipin, our calculation for the mol% of hopanoids in TLE using an average molecular weight of 786 g/mol may be very close to the real value in <i>R. palustris</i> TIE-1."

Because our main focus is on the effect of 2-methylhopanoids, we used the membranes from \u0394<i>hpnP</i> and added 5, 10, and 20 mol% purified hopanoids to constitute the SUV lipid mixture. We also included WT IM and OM for comparison. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> shows membrane rigidity measurements at 25\u00b0C using <i>R. palustris</i> TIE-1 membranes. In both WT and \u0394<i>hpnP</i>, the OM showed higher membrane rigidity than IM, which could be due to the higher hopanoid content in the OM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and differences in phospholipid content. Compared to WT, the \u0394<i>hpnP</i> IM and OM showed decreased rigidity. This contrasts with our whole cell membrane rigidity results in which no difference in rigidity was observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This discrepancy could be due to the presence of lipid A and outer membrane proteins that may affect the overall membrane rigidity in whole cells."

Our findings that 2Me-hopanoids rigidify membranes to different extents depending both on their specific structure (short or long) and lipid context not only provide a clear biological function for these compounds, but also help rationalize why previous efforts to identify such a function have been challenging. That methylation per se can contribute to rigidifying membranes may also help explain the association of methylated hopanoids in certain modern and ancient environments."

Might there be a mechanistic explanation for the enrichment of 2Me-hopanes during stressful OAEs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Knoll et al., 2007</a>)? Several independent lines of evidence bridge our biophysical findings with the abundance patterns in the rock record, together suggesting that 2-methylhopanoids confer stress resistance: (1) 2Me-hopanoids are enriched in the outer membrane of akinetes, survival cell types of the cyanobacterium <i>Nostoc punctiforme</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Doughty et al., 2009</a>), (2) a stress-responsive pathway upregulates the HpnP methylase in <i>R. palusris</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kulkarni et al., 2013</a>), (3) in modern environments, the capacity for 2Me-hopanoid production significantly correlates with organisms, metabolisms (e.g., nitrogen fixation), and environments that support plant\u2013microbe interactions (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ricci et al., 2014</a>). This correlation, together with the observation that (2Me)-hopanoids promote symbiosis (<a href=\"#bib49\">Silipo et al., 2014</a>), tempt us to speculate that 2Me-hopanoids may indirectly facilitate nitrogen fixation by enhancing bacterial survival under the stressful conditions that accompany the establishment of symbiosis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gibson et al., 2008</a>). Going forward, it is worth critically examining this hypothesis; if correct, such an interpretation would indicate that spikes in the 2Me-hopane index may reflect episodes of particular environmental stresses favoring the growth of organisms capable of withstanding it using (2Me)-hopanoids."

Molecular dynamic simulations of 2Me-hopanoid within a relevant lipid context are required to understand the interactions on an atomic scale. However, we may speculate about the mechanism of rigidification through lessons learned from studies of cholesterol, in which the number of methyl groups control its optimal molecular packing to geometrically complement phospholipid chains (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bloch, 1979</a>). The addition or removal of methyl groups over the evolution of the cholesterol lipid family is thought to have optimally tuned cholesterol's ability to order or condense phospholipid membranes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Miao et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rog et al., 2007</a>). We suggest that when a methyl group is added onto the 2\u2032 position of A-ring in hopanoid, the stearic hindrance between the 2-methyl group and the methyl groups at the 4\u2032 and 10\u2032 position of the A-ring could transform the ring from a chair to a twisted conformation. The two additional 1,3-diaxial interactions elicited by hopanoid 2-methylation could mimic the smoothing and/or tilting effect known for cholesterol, thus rationalizing how 2-methylation may improve the ability of hopanoids to rigidify membranes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rog et al., 2007</a>)."

Compared to (2Me)-Dip, the addition of a hydrophilic tail to form (2Me)-BHT or even BHT-glucosamine (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) may favor a stronger interaction with the outer leaflet of the OM, in which the lipid head group is heavily modified with hydrophilic molecules. The relative enrichment of (2Me)-BHT in the OM is consistent with such a scenario. The hydrophilic tail of 2Me-BHT could also affect the vertical position of the 2-methyl group in the membrane compared to 2Me-Dip (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rog et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Poger and Mark, 2013</a>), which may explain the difference between 2Me-BHT and 2Me-Dip in rigidifying membranes with different compositions.

In our <i>in vitro</i> experiments, we did not observe a significant difference in membrane rigidity when less than 10 mol% of (2Me)-hopanoids were used (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This may be due to a critical concentration needed to trigger an effect, which is consistent with molecular dynamic simulations that demonstrate cholesterol starts to self-organize within membranes at concentration above 10 mol% (<a href=\"#bib25\">Martinez-Seara et al., 2010</a>). However, we hasten to point out that the mol% of (2Me)-hopanoids in the native membrane experiment (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) are not directly comparable to those using model lipids (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) due to the presence of endogenous hopanoids in <i>\u0394hpnP</i> membranes. The existence of BHT in \u0394<i>hpnP</i> may explain why the membrane rigidifying effect of exogenously added BHT is saturated at 10 mol% in the <i>E. coli</i> PLE but has no impact on <i>R. palustris</i> TIE-1 IM and OM. In this context, it is noteworthy that cardiolipin significantly increases in the absence of all hopanoids (unpublished). In <i>E. coli</i>, cardiolipin localizes to negatively curved regions of the cell (<a href=\"#bib41\">Renner and Weibel, 2011</a>). Looking beyond the function of methylation, it is possible that certain hopanoid types could fulfill the geometry requirements of curved membranes and facilitate cell division or vesicle formation, consistent with both the microdomain features observed in prior subcellular hopanoid localization studies (<a href=\"#bib7\">Doughty et al., 2014</a>) and the strong cell division defect displayed by a mutant lacking the ability to transport hopanoids to the OM (<a href=\"#bib7\">Doughty et al., 2014</a>). Going forward, consideration of other roles for structurally diverse hopanoids, including the possibility that some might influence membrane protein function (<a href=\"#bib37\">Phillips et al., 2009</a>), modify specific proteins or cell wall components through covalent linkages (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jeong and McMahon, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Silipo et al., 2014</a>), or even play a role in signaling pathways in analogy to cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kuwabara and Labouesse, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aktas et al., 2010</a>), will enhance our appreciation for this ancient lipid class."

This freeze\u2013thaw cycle, which breaks down the giant vesicles into smaller ones, was repeated two more times. SUVs were prepared by passing the samples through 0.1-\u03bcm polycarbonate membranes (Whatman) using Avanti mini-Extruder at RT (Avanti Polar Lipids). The extrusion was performed a total of 11 times and the vesicle suspension became clear during the process. The sizes and stability of the SUVs was determined by dynamic light scattering (Wyatt (Santa Barbara, CA) DynaPro NanoStar.

In particular, the well documented effects on ion suppression should be mentioned (see <a href=\"#bib5\">Brugger et al., 1997</a>, in PNAS).

The speculation that the structural basis of the effect could arise from the twisting of the A\u2013ring from chair to boat is fundamentally sound, and as the manuscript notes, forms a promising area for future work. The authors might want to mention that, although 1,3-diaxial interactions of the C4 and C6 methyl groups in sterols (e.g. lanosterol) do not appear to distort the A\u2013ring, in the context of the hopane scaffold (lacking an equatorial C3 hydroxyl) these interactions themselves could be sufficient to distort the A\u2013ring into a twist boat and/or the methyl at C\u20132 would alter packing by changing interactions in the plane of the hopane structure."

In addition, chain length and degree of unsaturation also affect ionization. Previous work in the area of lipid analysis using mass spectrometry should be included. In particular, the well documented effects on ion suppression should be mentioned (see</i> <a href=\"#bib5\"><i>Brugger et al., 1997</i></a><i>, in PNAS). General lipidomic methodologies and reviews on phospholipids (H. A. Brown), neutral lipids (Robert Murphy), and sterols (David Russell) might be useful</i>."

The speculation that the structural basis of the effect could arise from the twisting of the A\u2013ring from chair to boat is fundamentally sound, and as the manuscript notes, forms a promising area for future work. The authors might want to mention that, although 1,3-diaxial interactions of the C4 and C6 methyl groups in sterols (e.g. lanosterol) do not appear to distort the A\u2013ring, in the context of the hopane scaffold (lacking an equatorial C3 hydroxyl) these interactions themselves could be sufficient to distort the A\u2013ring into a twist boat and/or the methyl at C\u20132 would alter packing by changing interactions in the plane of the hopane structure</i>."
