The flagellar capping protein (FliD) regulates filament assembly by chaperoning and sorting flagellin (FliC) proteins after they traverse the hollow filament and exit the growing flagellum tip. In the absence of FliD, flagella are not formed, resulting in impaired motility and infectivity. Here, we report the 2.2 \u00c5 resolution X-ray crystal structure of FliD from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, the first high-resolution structure of any FliD protein from any bacterium. Using this evidence in combination with a multitude of biophysical and functional analyses, we find that <i>Pseudomonas</i> FliD exhibits unexpected structural similarity to other flagellar proteins at the domain level, adopts a unique hexameric oligomeric state, and depends on flexible determinants for oligomerization. Considering that the flagellin filaments on which FliD oligomers are affixed vary in protofilament number between bacteria, our results suggest that FliD oligomer stoichiometries vary across bacteria to complement their filament assemblies."

The flagellar capping protein (FliD) regulates filament assembly by chaperoning and sorting flagellin (FliC) proteins after they traverse the hollow filament and exit the growing flagellum tip. In the absence of FliD, flagella are not formed, resulting in impaired motility and infectivity. Here, we report the 2.2 \u00c5 resolution X-ray crystal structure of FliD from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, the first high-resolution structure of any FliD protein from any bacterium. Using this evidence in combination with a multitude of biophysical and functional analyses, we find that <i>Pseudomonas</i> FliD exhibits unexpected structural similarity to other flagellar proteins at the domain level, adopts a unique hexameric oligomeric state, and depends on flexible determinants for oligomerization. Considering that the flagellin filaments on which FliD oligomers are affixed vary in protofilament number between bacteria, our results suggest that FliD oligomer stoichiometries vary across bacteria to complement their filament assemblies."

Flagella can rotate and propel the bacteria through liquids, such as water or blood, and they are constructed primarily from thousands of copies of a single protein called flagellin. When flagella are built, the flagellin proteins are placed in their proper positions by another protein called FliD, several copies of which form a cap on the end of flagella. Without FliD, bacteria cannot properly assemble flagella and, thus, can no longer swim; this also hinders their ability to cause disease."

The structure reveals that parts of this FliD protein are shaped like parts of other proteins from which flagella are constructed, including the flagellin protein that FliD places into position. Some parts of the FliD protein are also very flexible and these parts of the protein are responsible for holding numerous FliD proteins together as a cap. Finally, Postel et al. saw that six copies of FliD bind to one another to form a protein complex on the end of flagella. This last finding was particularly unexpected since it was thought that all FliD proteins formed five-membered cap complexes, an assumption that was based largely on studies of FliD from another bacterium called <i>Salmonella</i>."

Many of these microbes possess flagella, molecular machines responsible for cell motility, adherence to host cells, and pathogenicity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Duan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Haiko and Westerlund-Wikstrom, 2013</a>). Flagella are helix-shaped hollow attachments formed predominantly by thousands of copies of the protein flagellin (also called FliC), anchored in the bacterial membrane by a hook (or joint) that is attached to the basal body and that is composed of rotary motor proteins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arora et al., 1998</a>). A proton motive force typically drives the propeller motion of flagella (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berg, 2003</a>), resulting in swimming motility. A FliD (also called HAP2) oligomer forms the cap protein complex that is located at the tip of the flagellar filament (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yonekura et al., 2000</a>).\u00a0This\u00a0complex\u00a0controls the distal growth of the filament by regulating the assembly of FliC molecules, which are transported through the hollow filament from the cytoplasm to the tip of the flagellum."

It has\u00a0been suggested that the plate of the stool is formed by core regions of the FliD molecule, and that disordered/flexible regions form the five leg structures (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vonderviszt et al., 1998</a>)\u00a0that\u00a0are known to interact with the FliC filament. FliD exhibits low sequence similarity to the flagellar hook proteins and to\u00a0FliC. Nevertheless, it shares the disordered terminal regions\u00a0of these flagellar proteins,\u00a0a\u00a0common structural characteristic that is thought to control the\u00a0polymerization of flagellar proteins and to play an important role in interaction with the FliC filament (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vonderviszt et al., 1998</a>). These regions are the most conserved in FliD sequences across bacteria. Flagellum-mediated motility is crucial for the virulence and pathogenicity of numerous bacteria, including <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Black et al., 1988</a>), <i>Salmonella</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen-Vercoe and Woodward, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Marchetti et al., 2004</a>), <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">La Ragione et al., 2000</a>), <i>Vibrio cholera</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Krukonis and DiRita, 2003</a>), and\u00a0<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arora et al., 2005</a>), as well as the major causative agent of gastric cancer <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim et al., 1999</a>). To date, however, no high-resolution structure of any FliD protein exists. To better define the roles of FliD in bacterial motility and pathogenesis, we determined the first X-ray crystal structure of FliD at 2.2\u2009\u00c5 resolution, and assessed the structural contributions of its flexible regions using a multitude of complementary biophysical and functional analyses."

We expressed FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> in <i>E. coli</i> with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag and purified it to homogeneity by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA, size exclusion and anion exchange chromatography. We improved initially weakly diffracting crystals of FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> by random matrix microseed screening (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bergfors, 2003</a>), yielding crystals that diffracted to 2.2\u2009\u00c5 resolution. In the absence of any homologous protein that could be used as a model for molecular replacement, we crystallized a seleno-methionine derivative of FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> that included four leucine-to-methionine mutations (FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub>/L<sub>4</sub>\u2013M<sub>4</sub>).\u00a0This crystal provided phase information sufficient to build an initial model,\u00a0which\u00a0we used subsequently for molecular replacement with the native FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> dataset (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). We modeled residues 80\u2013273 into clear electron density, including all side chains, but observed density of increasingly poor quality in\u00a0the\u00a0C-terminus beyond residue 273 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). Thus, we were able to model with confidence only a single \u03b1 helix in this region, corresponding to residues 274\u2013308, with incomplete side chain structures. To determine whether the remaining region of the protein actually existed in the crystals and not just in the protein preparation used for crystallization, we analyzed crystals using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and SDS-PAGE. Both analyses indicated that the crystals consisted of an approximate 50:50 mixture of the FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> protein used for crystallization and a further proteolyzed version with a molecular weight of about 27\u2009kDa. The N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag is still detectable by Western blot (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>). Thus, the proteolyzed form corresponds approximately to residues 78\u2013319 of FliD. The 86 residues absent from the C-terminus in a population of FliD proteins are clearly not required for crystal packing, suggesting that they are highly flexible\u00a0even in a crystalline environment."

The head region is itself comprised of two separate, but entwined, protein domains. Residues 80\u2013101 form two \u03b2 strands that belong to the first domain (Head 1), the second domain (Head 2) is formed in its entirety by the contiguous residues 104\u2013230, and residues 231\u2013273 then complete the first domain. The second domain is, thus, a loop insertion of the first domain. We searched for structural homologs of these domains in the Protein Data Bank and found that the first domain of the head region (Head 1) exhibits high structural similarity (RMSD=2.5\u2009\u00c5), despite low sequence identity (14%), to the FlgK/HAP1/hook filament capping protein of <i>Burkholderia pseudomallei</i> (PDB code 4UT1; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>). Likewise, the second head region domain (Head 2) exhibits high structural similarity (RMSD=2.7\u2009\u00c5), despite low sequence identity (17%), to the FliC/flagellin protein of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (PDB code 4NX9; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). In contrast to the head region, the leg region of FliD is highly flexible, as indicated by the paucity of electron density corresponding to residues 274\u2013405 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a</a>). Despite this, we were able to model the initial \u03b1 helical structural element, corresponding to residues 274\u2013308, of this region.

This star shape has a minimum inner diameter of 48\u2009\u00c5 and a maximal outer diameter of 136\u2009\u00c5. When viewed from the side (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), the FliD hexamer appears as a six-legged stool, the legs of which extend 55\u2009\u00c5 below the bottom of the head region. Additional crystallographic symmetry results in the stacking of hexamers in alternating head-to-head and leg-to-leg orientations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>).\u00a0The leg-to-leg stacking\u00a0forms dodecamers, resulting from the helix\u2013helix interaction of the residues 274\u2013302 of stacked molecules and the interaction of residues 303\u2013308 of one FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> molecule with Head 1 domain\u00a0of a stacked molecule, burying a surface area of 1362 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>.

Thus, we confirmed that the hexameric assembly of FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> occurs not only in the crystalline environment but also in solution using negative stain EM class averaging (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tang et al., 2007</a>), resulting in an image that clearly exhibits a hexameric assembly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). These data are consistent with the oligomerization state that we detected in the crystal structure, in which a view looking down the \u03b1-helices of the leg reveals a six-membered ring organization. We also verified that both FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> and full-length FliD<sub>1\u2013474</sub> form oligomers by both analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and crosslinking analyses. We found that the FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> fragment that we crystallized oligomerizes up to a dodecameric state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b,c</a>), similar to the crystallographic assembly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). Additionally, we collected small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data of FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub>, for which the calculated radial distribution function (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>) is characteristic of an oligomeric assembly forming a hollow sphere (<a href=\"#bib51\">Svergun and Koch, 2003</a>). These data produce a molecular envelope that superimposes well with our dodecameric FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> X-ray crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). Full-length FliD<sub>1\u2013474</sub>, by contrast, forms up to hexamers in solution (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e,f</a>), which are likely to represent the physiologically\u00a0relevant oligomerization state of this protein on the tip of the flagellum. The predominant tetrameric species in solution identified by AUC may be a stable intermediate on the path to hexamer formation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>)."

The \u0394<i>fliD</i> transposon strain does not form flagella, as indicated by the lack of FliC in the analyzed flagella preparations (lane 5 on the\u00a0stained Western blot membrane, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In comparison, the wildtype and all complementation strains form flagella as indicated by the presence of flagellin/FliC in the purified flagella samples (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Together, these data indicate that FliD that\u00a0is\u00a0covalently locked in its hexameric assembly can form functional flagella that allow <i>Pseudomonas</i> bacteria to swim like <i>Pseudomonas</i> with wildtype FliD. Thus, the hexamer oligomeric state of <i>Pseudomonas</i> FliD is functional in vivo."

To determine whether these interactions were sufficient to drive oligomerization of FliD, we expressed and purified the head region only, FliD<sub>78\u2013273</sub>. By AUC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>), chemical crosslinking (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>) and SAXS analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>), we observed that when FliD lacks the leg region and the N- and C-terminal coiled-coil domains, it\u00a0is\u00a0present predominantly in the form of monomers (and dimers to a lesser extent) in solution, but fails to form higher-order oligomers as do the longer versions of FliD that we analyzed. Because different buffer conditions, including changes\u00a0in\u00a0pH, have been shown to affect the polymerization states of flagellar filaments (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shibata et al., 2005</a>) and capping proteins (<a href=\"#bib24\">Imada et al., 1998</a>), we performed additional AUC experiments and found that FliD<sub>78\u2013273</sub> is entirely monomeric at pH 8.0 and becomes approximately one-third dimeric at pH 5.0; we observed no higher-order oligomers of FliD<sub>78\u2013273</sub> regardless of buffer conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). We also assessed, by chemical cross-linking, the oligomerization states of FliD variants lacking only the N-terminal coiled-coil domain (FliD<sub>78\u2013474</sub>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>) or the C-terminal coiled-coil domain (FliD<sub>1\u2013405</sub>; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5f</a>). We found them to be mainly monomeric with a minority of species appearing to dimerize, although the latter exhibit weak higher-order oligomerization potential. Kratky plots and radial distribution functions calculated from SAXS data of the variants lacking either the N- or C-terminal coiled-coil domain, FliD<sub>78\u2013474</sub> or FliD<sub>1\u2013405</sub> respectively, reveal that these proteins adopt extended shapes with flexible regions that are clearly represented in the resulting molecular envelopes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a,b</a>). These data indicate that the driving force for hexamerization of <i>Pseudomonas</i> FliD resides in molecular determinants outside of the head region and, at a minimum, involves residues in the N-terminal and C-terminal coiled-coil domains. FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> is lacking the C-terminal and N-terminal coiled-coil domain but still assembles into dodecamers, as shown in the crystal structure, cross-linking experiments and AUC, which is likely caused by strand replacement in the head region domain 1 and helix\u2013helix (residues 274\u2013308) interaction of stacked molecules (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>)."

We subjected FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> to H/D exchange for 10 s to 2\u2009hr and observed that the head region (residues 80\u2013273) of FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> adopts a largely stable exchange-protected fold with greater stability observed for domain 2 relative to that of domain 1.\u00a0The leg region, particularly residues C-terminal to the \u03b1 helix observed in the crystal structure, is more disordered\u00a0or\u00a0less stable (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). Residues linking head domain 1 to the leg helix display cooperative unfolding behavior as indicated by EX1 kinetics (<a href=\"#bib60\">Weis et al., 2006</a>) that result in double isotopic envelopes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>). The FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub>\u00a0protein used in these experiments was folded properly as shown by circular dichroism, as were all other FliD protein fragments that we produced (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When mapped to our crystal structure of FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub>, the degree of H/D exchange over time on the peptide level corresponds to the degree of conformational stability on the residue level (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>).

HDX-MS heat maps show the overall high degree of flexibility of FliD regions outside the head domain (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and difference plots of FliD truncations in comparison to the full length FliD<sub>1\u2013474</sub> indicate that the head region, and more specifically head region domain 1, is stabilized by FliD regions outside of the head region (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>). Indeed, the N-terminal coiled coil is responsible for this stabilization of head region domain 1, in addition to stabilization of residues between the leg region \u03b1 helix and the C-terminal coiled coil (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>). Finally, the C-terminal coiled coil predominantly stabilizes residues in the N-terminal coiled coil (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>). The stabilization of one FliD region by another is most likely to be direct and intramolecular, rather than allosteric and intermolecular, as the full-length protein FliD<sub>1\u2013474</sub> adopts predominantly monomeric species under the conditions that we used for HDX-MS analysis (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This leads to a transient structural model of the entire FliD monomer subunit (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d</a>) in which the N-terminal coiled coil bridges the head and foot regions and is itself pinned to these structural elements by the C-terminal coiled coil. Notably, none of the flexible regions of FliD, save the C-terminal 20 residues, are consistently predicted by sequence analysis to be intrinsically disordered (<a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3</a>); rather, they are inherently capable of adopting a limited number of conformations required to be in an 'on-state' (actively chaperoning and sorting a FliC protein) or an 'off-state' (engaging only structured and previously positioned FliC proteins)."

We found that <i>Pseudomonas</i> FliD instead forms hexamers both in crystals and in solution. Additionally, we showed that <i>Pseudomonas</i> FliD constrained to its hexameric state by inter-subunit disulfide bonds is functional in vivo, resulting in the formation of flagella and swimming motility. Conversely, <i>Salmonella</i> FliD\u00a0that\u00a0assembles as pentamers does not allow flagellar formation and swimming motility in <i>Pseudomonas</i> bacteria."

First, each one of the six FliD head regions that appear as discreet lobes when visualized by EM analysis is actually composed of the first and second domains of neighboring monomer subunits, as opposed to both domains belonging to the same subunit. This is likely the case for FliD oligomers from diverse bacteria, including <i>Salmonella</i> FliD for which cryo-EM analyses showed five head region lobes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Maki-Yonekura et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yonekura et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">2003</a>). Second, despite vanishingly low sequence similarity, each domain within the head region exhibits high structural similarity to the\u00a0corresponding\u00a0domains of other flagellar proteins, including the hook-filament junction protein/FlgK and flagellin/FliC. Thus, at least one protein domain from the proteins that occupy the distal ends of the hook (FlgK) and the cap (FliD) adopts a common structural fold, which may be required for and unique to their function at these related positions within the flagellum. This domain conservation among flagellar proteins confirms a previous study proposing a structural relationship of FliD to other flagellar proteins despite their low sequence similarities (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vonderviszt et al., 1998</a>). This structural conservation suggests that a structurally similar cap complex may form at both hook and on the distal end.\u00a0It also suggests that FliD may play a functional role earlier in the flagellar assembly process, prior to its known FliC\u00a0sorting function. Notably, in mutants of <i>Salmonella</i>\u00a0that\u00a0lack filaments, FlgK (HAP1), FliD (HAP2) and FlgL (HAP3) form a layered structure at the distal end of the hook-basal body (<a href=\"#bib22\">Homma and Iino, 1985</a>). In addition, the shared domain structure of portions of FliC and FliD suggests that the chaperoning activity of FliD could derive, at least in part, from its presentation of a like-structured template against which FliC subunits may fold prior to being positioned into the growing filament."

However, using a number of biophysical methods, we found that molecular determinants outside of the conformationally stable head regions control FliD oligomerization. Previous analysis of a trypsinized fragment of <i>Salmonella</i> FliD that lacks the N-terminal 42 residues and C-terminal 51 residues, which is similar to the <i>Pseudomonas</i> FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub> protein that we crystallized, showed that this fragment can form pentamers but not decamers in solution and dissociates into smaller oligomers at low temperatures (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vonderviszt et al., 1998</a>). This suggests that determinants outside of the head regions of FliD proteins of diverse bacteria control their oligomeric states. Accordingly, we showed that FliD, when constrained to its hexameric state by disulfide bonds formed between neighboring head domain subunits, is fully functional in vivo.\u00a0Thus,conformational flexibility in or relative repositioning of the head regions are not functional requirements of FliD but flexibility in regions outside of the head regions undoubtedly is. Considering that inhibiting protein\u2013protein interfaces with small molecules remains a major technical challenge (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arkin et al., 2014</a>), the dependence of FliD oligomeric assembly on its flexible regions enhances the prospects of developing small molecule inhibitors of FliD oligomerization, and consequently of flagellar function, as a novel class of antibiotic agents."

SedenTerp (<a href=\"http://sednterp.unh.edu\">http://sednterp.unh.edu</a>) was used to calculate protein partial specific volumes and solvent densities and viscosities from the protein amino acid sequences and buffer compositions. For sedimentation velocity measurements, samples of 295\u2009\u03bcM (pH 8.0) or 325\u2009\u03bcM (pH 5.0) FliD<sub>78\u2013405</sub>, 124 \u03bcM\u00a0FliD<sub>78\u2013273</sub>, and 168\u2009\u03bcM FliD<sub>1\u2013474</sub> were prepared in each buffer.

After exhaustive dialysis to ensure chemical equilibrium, the samples were loaded into cells equipped with 2-hole charcoal-filled epon centerpieces (either 1.2 or 0.3\u2009mm path length) with sapphire windows. Prior to centrifugation, samples were equilibrated in the rotor for at least 2\u2009hr at the desired experimental temperature.

By crosslinking, we can detect monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric, pentameric and hexameric species; by AUC analysis of highly concentrated FliD solutions, we detect tetrameric and hexameric species, predominantly. It is possible that the tetramer may be some form of stable intermediate on the path to hexamers, but we do not have enough data to say this unequivocally. Despite the lack of stability of the <i>Pseudomonas</i> FliD hexamer, we previously (prior to submission of the original manuscript, in fact) attempted to perform negative-stain EM using both crosslinked FliD<sub>1-474</sub> and native FliD<sub>1-474</sub> at low pH, in the hopes that we could detect larger particles. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in this regard. The tendency of <i>Pseudomonas</i> FliD to oligomerize is much less than that of <i>Salmonella</i> FliD, for which the equilibrium state in solution, even in the absence of the flagellar filament, is almost entirely decameric, as previously shown by crosslinking and AUC analyses conducted by others (and confirmed by us \u2013 data not shown)."

To show this, we would have to show that <i>Pseudomonas</i> FliD acts as a hexamer in vivo, which we have done in a series of additional experiments shown in a new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. These experiments are briefly summarized, as follows. We designed, based on our crystal structure, disulfide bonds in full-length <i>Pseudomonas</i> FliD that results in a stable FliD hexamer under non-reducing conditions, which we showed by SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry and SAXS. We then complemented a \u25b3<i>fliD Pseudomonas</i> strain with the full-length disulfide-constrained <i>fliD<sub>1-474(I167C/D253C)</sub></i> gene, which we tested for swimming motility in a functional assay. This complemented strain restored the swimming motility that was lost in the \u25b3<i>fliD</i> strain, in a way indistinguishable to that of a full-length wildtype complement (\u25b3<i>fliD/fliD<sub>1-474</sub></i>). We isolated flagella from the live, growing \u25b3<i>fliD/fliD<sub>1-474(I167C/D253C)</sub> Pseudomonas</i> bacteria and showed by Western blot analysis that the FliD<sub>1-474(I167C/D253C)</sub> protein remained hexameric in these flagella that provided swimming motility to the bacteria. We therefore conclude that FliD from <i>Pseudomonas</i> is functional in a disulfide-locked, hexameric state. Because the disulfide bond was formed between neighboring head regions, these data also indicate that flexibility of the head domains, or at least their relative repositioning, is not required for FliD capping function. In contrast, we found in a similar set of genetic and functional experiments that <i>Salmonella</i> FliD cannot complement a \u25b3<i>fliD Pseudomonas</i> strain and does not restore swimming motility, additional evidence that FliD in a pentameric state is incompatible with <i>Pseudomonas</i> flagella formation."

Therefore, it is also unlikely that domain-swap polymerization between the head domains plays any functional role. Without high-resolution structural information for the other flexible regions of FliD that do drive self-assembly, though, it is possible that domain-swaps occur between these other domains. Such a domain-swap molecular mechanism within these other regions outside of the head region may contribute, in part or in whole, to FliD self-assembly.

For instance, there is clearly no difference in Figure 2B, spots #3 (<i>Salty</i> \u25b3<i>fliC</i> mutant (SJW2536)), #4 (<i>Salty</i> \u25b3<i>fliC</i> mutant transduced with p<i>Pseae</i> (PAO1) <i>fliC</i>). #5 (<i>Salty</i> \u25b3<i>fliC</i> mutant p<i>Pseae</i> (PAK) <i>fliC</i>), #6 (<i>Salty</i> \u25b3<i>fliD</i> mutant (MH43)), and#7 (<i>Salty</i> \u25b3<i>fliD</i> mutant transduced with p<i>Pseae</i> (PAO1) <i>fliD</i>). None of these strains exhibit swarming motility in this assay, whereas wildtype <i>Pseae</i> (PAK) and <i>Pseae</i> (PAO1) strains do exhibit swarming motility, as seen in Figure 2B, spots #1 and #2, respectively. Likewise, the electron microscopic evidence is non-existent for functional FliC and FliD exchange between <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i>. In Figure 5A, panels #2 (<i>Salty</i> \u25b3<i>fliC</i> mutant transduced with p<i>Pseae</i> (PAO1) <i>fliC</i>) and #3 (<i>Salty</i> \u25b3<i>fliC</i> mutant transduced with p<i>Pseae</i> (PAK) <i>fliC</i>) do not show functional flagella. Similarly, appendages shown in Figure 8A (<i>Salty</i> \u25b3<i>fliD</i> mutant transduced with p<i>Pseae</i> (PAO1) <i>fliD</i>) look nothing like fully formed wildtype flagella. These short, stubby appendages do not resemble the functional flagella shown in other electron micrographs in this paper (e.g., of wildtype bacteria strains), but could possibly be flagella formed up to the hook, which would fit with non-exchangeability of these FliC and also FliD proteins (although we do not have access to enough of their data to say this with any certainty). Finally, in Figure 9C, the double complementation (<i>Salty</i> \u25b3<i>fliC</i> \u25b3<i>fliD</i> mutant transduced with both p<i>Pseae</i> (PAO1) <i>fliC</i> and p<i>Pseae</i> (PAO1) <i>fliD</i> together) exhibit absolutely no appendages that could be (mis)construed as flagella.
