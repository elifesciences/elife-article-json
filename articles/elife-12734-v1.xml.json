                    "text": "The ability of a neuron to regenerate its axon after injury depends in part on its intrinsic regenerative potential. Here, we identify novel intrinsic regulators of axon regeneration: poly(ADP-ribose) glycohodrolases (PARGs) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). PARGs, which remove poly(ADP-ribose) from proteins, act in injured <i>C. elegans</i> GABA motor neurons to enhance axon regeneration. PARG expression is regulated by DLK signaling, and PARGs mediate DLK function in enhancing axon regeneration. Conversely, PARPs, which add poly(ADP-ribose) to proteins, inhibit axon regeneration of both <i>C. elegans</i> GABA neurons and mammalian cortical neurons. Furthermore, chemical PARP inhibitors improve axon regeneration when administered after injury. Our results indicate that regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) levels is a critical function of the DLK regeneration pathway, that poly-(ADP ribosylation) inhibits axon regeneration across species, and that chemical inhibition of PARPs can elicit axon regeneration."

Here, we identify novel intrinsic regulators of axon regeneration: poly(ADP-ribose) glycohodrolases (PARGs) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). PARGs, which remove poly(ADP-ribose) from proteins, act in injured <i>C. elegans</i> GABA motor neurons to enhance axon regeneration. PARG expression is regulated by DLK signaling, and PARGs mediate DLK function in enhancing axon regeneration. Conversely, PARPs, which add poly(ADP-ribose) to proteins, inhibit axon regeneration of both <i>C. elegans</i> GABA neurons and mammalian cortical neurons. Furthermore, chemical PARP inhibitors improve axon regeneration when administered after injury. Our results indicate that regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) levels is a critical function of the DLK regeneration pathway, that poly-(ADP ribosylation) inhibits axon regeneration across species, and that chemical inhibition of PARPs can elicit axon regeneration."

We sorted GABA motor neurons from animals with activated DLK signaling (<i>dlk-1(OE)</i>, conferred by overexpression of DLK-1L [<a href=\"#bib14\">Hammarlund et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Yan and Jin, 2012</a>]) and compared them to <i>wild-type</i> GABA neurons. To control for potential off-target effects of DLK activation, we also analyzed neurons that contained both <i>dlk-1(OE)</i> and a loss of function mutation in <i>pmk-3,</i> the MAP kinase at the end of the canonical DLK signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib17\">Nakata et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hammarlund et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Yan and Jin, 2012</a>). RNA sequencing and analysis suggested the <i>parg</i> genes as candidates for further evaluation. The gene <i>parg-2</i> (poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase-2) was significantly upregulated in neurons with activated DLK signaling (187-fold upregulated in <i>dlk-1(OE)</i> vs <i>wild type</i>, p&lt;0.01, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Further, examination of RNA-Seq results for the <i>parg-</i>2 paralog, <i>parg-1,</i> detected a 2.5-fold increase in the <i>dlk-1(OE)</i> background compared to <i>wild type</i> (p&lt;0.05, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (See Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Elevated expression of <i>parg-1</i> and <i>parg-2</i> by DLK signaling depended on the canonical DLK MAP kinase pathway since up-regulation was eliminated in neurons that over-expressed <i>dlk-1</i> but lacked its downstream effector <i>pmk-3</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). These data suggested that regulation of PARG function might be a major effect of DLK signaling. Overall, up-regulation (&gt;two fold, p&lt;0.05) (See Materials and methods) of gene expression by DLK signaling was observed for only 1.9% of coding genes (386 out of 20,375 protein coding genes assayed); expression of most genes was not affected by DLK signaling. For example, expression levels of the pan-neuronal control gene <i>rgef-1</i> (a ras nucleotide exchange factor) were not altered in either mutant background (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Together, our data indicate <i>parg</i> expression is regulated by DLK signaling in GABA neurons."

To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of PARP knockdown on mouse cortical neuron regeneration. We cultured primary cortical mouse neurons in 96-well plates (<a href=\"#bib15\">Huebner et al., 2011</a>). We subsequently added lentiviral control or one of two unique PARP1 shRNAs at three days in vitro (DIV), and injured the neurons with a custom pin-replicator five days later (<a href=\"#bib15\">Huebner et al., 2011</a>). Three days after injury, we fixed the neurons and assessed regeneration. We found that axons exposed to PARP1 shRNA regenerated significantly better than axons exposed to control shRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). To confirm the shRNA clones targeted PARP1, we performed western blots on cortical neurons exposed to the negative control shRNA or to the two unique shRNA that target PARP1. In each case PARP was detected in the insoluble fraction and not in the lysate, in agreement with previously reported localization to the nucleus (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib3\">Bai, 2015</a>). PARP was significantly reduced in neurons exposed to either of the PARP1-targeting shRNAs compared to negative control shRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>).

Primary cortical cultures were established from E17 C57BL/6 mice. Digested cells were plated on 96-well poly-D-lysine coated plates at a density of 25,000 cells per well in 200 \u00b5L of plating medium. Lentiviral particles encoding control non-targeting or PARP1 shRNA clones (Sigma) were added on DIV3 (Day In Vitro 3) as described for other shRNAs (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zou et al., 2015</a>). On DIV8, 96-well cultures were scraped using a custom-fabricated 96-pin array and allowed to regenerate for another 72\u2009hr before fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde. Regenerating axons in the scrape zone were visualized using an antibody against \u03b23 tubulin (1:2000, mouse monoclonal; catalog #G712A; Promega). Growth cones were visualized by staining for F-actin using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:2000, catalog #R415, Life Technologies). Cell density was visualized using nuclear marker DAPI (0.1\u2009\u03bcg/mL, catalog #4083, Cell Signaling Technology). Images were taken on a 10X objective in an automated high-throughput imager (ImageXpress Micro XLS, Molecular Devices) under identical conditions. Regeneration zone identification, image thresholding and quantitation were performed using an automated MATLAB script in a fully automated fashion."

They find that overexpressing DLK, which promotes regeneration, leads to the upregulation of PARGS (glycohydrolases that remove PAR [poly(ADP-ribose)]. They show that loss of PARGS inhibits regeneration. PAR is generated by PARP1-here it is shown that genetic or pharmacological loss of PARP1 enhances regeneration. This is an interesting and well-done study that makes a significant contribution to the field. However, there are a number of suggestions to improve the manuscript. For example, both reviewers found the mammalian part of the paper to be somewhat preliminary and suggested cutting it out. Both reviewers also found it necessary to include more careful interpretation and discussion of the PARG double mutant, especially in the DLK OE case. One reviewer would also like to see the figure modified to include the <i>parg1, 2</i> DKO on the same histogram as the <i>dlk oe, parg1,2</i> DKO."

However, our work on the PARGs/PARP pathway identifies a novel mechanism, PARylation, that significantly regulates the ability of an injured axon to regenerate after injury. Further, this mechanism is distinct from DLK in that it is 1) druggable; 2) affects functional recovery after injury; and 3) does not affect synaptic morphology. Thus, the role of the PARGs and PARPs is different from DLK. In our opinion, our findings are significant because they identify PARylation as important to the cell biology of axon regeneration, they reveal an axon regeneration-specific mechanism downstream of DLK, and they show that drugs that target this pathway improve axon regeneration and functional recovery."
