Genotoxic agents trigger a 'nuclear-to-cytoplasmic' NF-\u03baB activation signaling pathway; however, the early nuclear signaling cascade linking DNA damage and NF-\u03baB activation is poorly understood. Here we report that Src-associated-substrate-during-mitosis-of-68kDa/KH domain containing, RNA binding, signal transduction associated 1 (Sam68/KHDRBS1) is a key NF-\u03baB regulator in genotoxic stress-initiated signaling pathway. Sam68 deficiency abolishes DNA damage-stimulated polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) production and the PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB transactivation of anti-apoptotic genes. Sam68 deleted cells are hypersensitive to genotoxicity caused by DNA damaging agents. Upregulated Sam68 coincides with elevated PAR production and NF-\u03baB-mediated anti-apoptotic transcription in human and mouse colon cancer. Knockdown of Sam68 sensitizes human colon cancer cells to genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis and genetic deletion of Sam68 dampens colon tumor burden in mice. Together our data reveal a novel function of Sam68 in the genotoxic stress-initiated nuclear signaling, which is crucial for colon tumorigenesis."

Genotoxic agents trigger a 'nuclear-to-cytoplasmic' NF-\u03baB activation signaling pathway; however, the early nuclear signaling cascade linking DNA damage and NF-\u03baB activation is poorly understood. Here we report that Src-associated-substrate-during-mitosis-of-68kDa/KH domain containing, RNA binding, signal transduction associated 1 (Sam68/KHDRBS1) is a key NF-\u03baB regulator in genotoxic stress-initiated signaling pathway. Sam68 deficiency abolishes DNA damage-stimulated polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) production and the PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB transactivation of anti-apoptotic genes. Sam68 deleted cells are hypersensitive to genotoxicity caused by DNA damaging agents. Upregulated Sam68 coincides with elevated PAR production and NF-\u03baB-mediated anti-apoptotic transcription in human and mouse colon cancer. Knockdown of Sam68 sensitizes human colon cancer cells to genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis and genetic deletion of Sam68 dampens colon tumor burden in mice. Together our data reveal a novel function of Sam68 in the genotoxic stress-initiated nuclear signaling, which is crucial for colon tumorigenesis."

NF-\u03baB responds to genotoxic threats (<i>e.g.</i> DNA damaging agents and \u03b3-irradiation) via the activation of the inhibitor of NF-\u03baB kinase (IKK) and NF-\u03baB liberation from I\u03baB proteins, similar to the canonical pathway activated by external stimuli (<a href=\"#bib27\">Janssens et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Perkins, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Scheidereit, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wu and Miyamoto, 2007</a>). NF-\u03baB signaling pathway has emerged as an important mediator for cellular responses to DNA damage, in particular NF-\u03baB-conferred anti-apoptotic transcription facilitates the cell 'escape' from the lethal effects of DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib27\">Janssens et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Perkins, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Scheidereit, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wu and Miyamoto, 2007</a>) and initiates cell cycle checkpoint control to promote cellular recovery from damage (<a href=\"#bib39\">McCool and Miyamoto, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Miyamoto, 2011</a>). Besides ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and IKK\u03b3, two known crucial regulators of the genotoxic stress-activated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Piret et al., 1999</a>), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) was recently revealed to be indispensable for the signaling cascade that links nuclear DNA damage recognition to cytoplasmic IKK activation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Stilmann et al., 2009</a>). Sequential post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation, of these signaling regulators are critical for NF-\u03baB activation following DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib22\">Huang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mabb et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wu et al., 2006</a>), in particular, PARP1-catalyzed poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) has emerged as a vital means for rapid assembly of the signaling complexes that are critical for DNA damage-initiated NF-\u03baB activation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mabb et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Stilmann et al., 2009</a>). Although these studies have considerably advanced our understanding of the cellular response to DNA damage, the genotoxic stress-initiated \u2018\u2018nuclear-to-cytoplasmic\u2019\u2019 NF-\u03baB signaling pathway remains poorly understood, in particular the early signaling networks linking DNA lesion recognition in the nucleus to subsequent activation of IKK and liberation of NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm."

Through its KH (heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein particle K homology) domain, Sam68 is capable of binding single- and double-stranded DNA in addition to RNA (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lukong and Richard, 2003</a>). Of note, Sam68 was identified as a PAR-binding protein in alkylating agent treated cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gagne et al., 2008</a>) and a putative substrate of ATM, ATM and Rad3-related (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Beli et al., 2012</a>), which suggests that Sam68 could be an important molecule in the cellular response to DNA damage. Although emerging evidence suggests the involvement of Sam68 in multiple signaling pathways, it has not been extensively investigated yet whether Sam68, an almost strictly nuclear protein, participates in the signal communication network of nuclear-initiated signaling pathways. Moreover, aberrant expression of Sam68 has been acknowledged in multiple cancers and elevated Sam68 expression correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis in cancer patients (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Liao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Song et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>).

Sam68 deletion diminishes DNA damage-stimulated PARP1 activation and PAR production, as well as the PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling and transactivation of an array of anti-apoptotic genes. As a consequence, Sam68 knockout cells are hypersensitive to genotoxicity caused by \u03b3-irradiation and DNA damaging chemicals. Moreover, downregulation of Sam68 substantially sensitizes human colorectal cancer cells to spontaneous and genotoxic stress-induced cell death and retards colon tumor growth and survival in genetically susceptible <i>Apc</i><sup>min716/+</sup> mice.

As expected, Camptothecin (CPT), a DNA-damaging chemical that inhibits DNA topoisomerase I (<a href=\"#bib60\">Stilmann et al., 2009</a>), stimulated a rapid degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, a prerequisite for NF-\u03baB liberation and transactivation, in a dose- and time-dependent manner in wild-type MEFs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, DNA damage-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation was remarkably attenuated in Sam68 KO MEFs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>) and MEFs without poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP1) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), a recently identified key nuclear regulator of DNA damage-induced NF-\u03baB activation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Stilmann et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, CPT treatment triggered remarkable nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB in wild-type MEFs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>); additionally, the derived nuclear extracts formed high-affinity binding complexes with immunoglobin (Ig) \u03baB double-stranded DNA, which was further confirmed by cold oligonucleotide competition and super shift assays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In striking contrast, NF-\u03baB nuclear accumulation and binding capacity to Ig \u03baB DNA were almost abolished in the CPT-stimulated Sam68 KO MEFs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>). To ascertain that Sam68 deficiency solely results in the impaired genotoxic stress-induced NF-\u03baB activation in MEFs, we examined the NF-\u03baB signaling in wild-type MEFs with Sam68 knockdown by small interference RNAs (siRNAs) and Sam68 KO MEFs supplemented with exogenous Sam68. CPT-triggered I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation was substantially reduced in Sam68-specific siRNA-expressing wild-type MEFs, compared to scrambled non-specific siRNA-transfected cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), whereas ectopic expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged Sam68, but not GFP alone, markedly restored CPT-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in Sam68 KO MEFs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013E</a>). Together, these results suggest that Sam68 could execute an essential function in the nuclear-initiated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway."

                                "text": "Sam68 is an almost strictly nuclear protein; its nuclear import is conferred by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ishidate et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lukong and Richard, 2003</a>). Consistently, the \u0394C (deletion of C-terminal NLS) mutant of Sam68 switches its preferred subcellular localization to the cytoplasm, in contrast to the strict nuclear accumulation observed in wild-type Sam68 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Sam68 KO MEFs reconstituted with wild-type Sam68, but not GFP control, displayed restored CPT-triggered NF-\u03baB activation signaling including I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, phosphorylation of p65, and p65 nuclear accumulation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013F</a>). In contrast, supplementing with the Sam68 (\u0394C) mutant failed to restore CPT-triggered I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), which indicates an indispensable role of the Sam68 nuclear function in DNA damage-initiated NF-\u03baB activation. Indeed, CPT treatment-induced SUMOylation of IKK\u03b3, a pivotal post-translational modification on IKK\u03b3 in the nucleus that subsequently leads to activation of IKK\u03b2 and liberation of NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib22\">Huang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mabb et al., 2006</a>), was substantially attenuated in Sam68 KO MEFs in comparison to wild-type controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Moreover, assembly of the PARP1-IKK\u03b3 signal complex has been established as a prerequisite for cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB activation in the cellular response to genotoxic stresses (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gibson and Kraus, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">McCool and Miyamoto, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Miyamoto, 2011</a>). As expected, PARP1 complexed with IKK\u03b3 following CPT treatment, whereas there was no detectable PARP1-IKK\u03b3 interaction in the absence of genotoxic stress in wild-type MEFs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In striking contrast, the CPT-induced PARP1-IKK\u03b3 interaction was abolished in Sam68 KO MEFs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Moreover, strong inducible interactions among Sam68, PARP1, and IKK\u03b3 were observed in wild-type MEFs, at 20\u2009min after CPT treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>). Of note, immune-depletion of Sam68 using antibodies abolished the CPT-induced PARP1-IKK\u03b3 interaction in wild-type MEFs (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that PARP1 interacts with Sam68 and IKK\u03b3 simultaneously. Hence our results suggest that Sam68 participates in the early nuclear signaling cascade in DNA damage-initiated NF-\u03baB activation."

The inducible Sam68-PARP1 interaction following genotoxic stress led us to examine whether Sam68 impacts DNA break-stimulated PAR synthesis. As expected, CPT treatment induced a wide array of PARylated proteins peaking at 20 min post stimulation in wild-type MEFs, which were diminished by one-hour pretreatment with two independent PARP inhibitors, Olaparib and PJ-34, thus confirming the PAR specificity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Strikingly, genotoxic stress-induced PAR synthesis was markedly dampened in Sam68 KO MEFs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Consistently, genotoxic stress-induced PARylation of the known PARP1 substrates including PARP1 itself, NBS1, and Ku70 was also substantially attenuated in Sam68 KO MEFs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). PAR that is synthesized after DNA damage can be rapidly degraded by PAR glycohydrolase (PARG), therefore we examined the possibility that PARG is hyper-activated in the absence of Sam68, thus degrading the formed PAR chains immediately after genotoxic stress. However, down-regulation of PARG by siRNA in Sam68 KO MEFs failed to restore CPT-induced PAR production to a similar level to that in wild-type MEFs (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which suggests that the attenuated PAR formation in the absence of Sam68 is not caused by a rapid degradation of PAR chains. Furthermore, CPT and \u03b3-irradiation stimulated PAR production was markedly reduced in primary colonic epithelial cells (CECs) derived from <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>-/-</sup> (Sam68 knockout) mice, compared to <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/-</sup> (Sam68 heterozygote) controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>), thus supporting the critical function of Sam68 in controlling DNA damage-stimulated PAR production."

Remarkably, Sam68 was enriched in chromatin fractions in MEFs following \u03b3-irradiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) and CPT treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), and the kinetics of Sam68 enrichment was similar to that of PARP1 on damaged chromatin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), which supports the inducible interaction between Sam68 and PARP1 in the early DNA damage signaling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>). Moreover, Sam68 and PARP1 were still substantially enriched in chromatin fractions in the PARP1-inhibited MEFs following \u03b3-irradiation (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), indicating that genotoxic stress-induced Sam68 enrichment in chromatin is not dependent on PAR formation. We further examined whether ectopic expression of PARP1 could rescue the defect in DNA damage-induced PAR formation caused by Sam68 loss. As expected, supplementing exogenous GFP-Sam68, compared to the GFP control, largely restored \u03b3-irradiation-stimulated PAR production in Sam68 KO MEFs (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). In contrast, PARP1 overexpression did not rescue the PAR chain formation in response to \u03b3-irradiation under a Sam68 deleted condition (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>), which suggests that Sam68 is required for DNA damage-triggered PARP1 activation and is consistent with Sam68 being an essential upstream activator of PARP1."

In contrast to the genotoxic stress-induced Sam68-PARP1 interaction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>), no detectable interaction between Sam68 and PARP2 was observed under either unstimulated or damaged conditions (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Provided the crucial funciton of PARP1 in DNA damage responses, we therefore examined whether Sam68 impacts PARP1-conferred PARylation following DNA damage. In line with the vigorous PAR production in the presence of genotoxic stress (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), immunoprecipitated PARP1 was associated with Sam68 and various PARylated target proteins in CPT-treated wild-type MEFs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). In contrast, the PARylated species were dramatically reduced despite an equal amount of PARP1 immunoprecipitated from Sam68 KO MEFs was used (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Conversely, supplementing with GFP-tagged Sam68, in comparison to a GFP control, markedly augmented the DNA damage-triggered PAR synthesis in CPT-treated Sam68 KO MEFs (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>), further supporting the key function of Sam68 in controlling DNA damage-initiated PARylation. To assess the direct impact of Sam68 on PARP1-catalyzed PAR production, we utilized recombinant PARP1 and Sam68 proteins in in vitro PARylation assays. DNA damage-activated PARP1 auto-modified itself with the addition of PAR moieties in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) and DNA, as indicated by the formation of PARylated PARP1 species (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>) and a corresponding reduction in unmodified PARP1 protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>, compare lane 4 with lane 3). Strikingly, incubation of recombinant Sam68 protein, but not GST control, with PARP1 dramatically boosted PAR production, which was paralleled by a sharp loss of unmodified PARP1 protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>, compare lane 5 with lane 4). Of note, the amount of Sam68 protein from the boosted PARylation reaction remained at a comparable level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>, compare lane 5 with lane 7), thus ruling out the possibility that Sam68 is a substrate of PARP1 in vitro and indicating that Sam68 harbors a stimulatory function for DNA-dependent PARP1 activity. In the absence of PARP1, neither GST nor GST-Sam68 protein exhibited PARylation activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>, lanes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 10), indicating that Sam68 per se does not possess the enzymatic activity to transfer ADP-ribosyl polymers. Moreover, in the absence of damaged DNA, incubation of Sam68 and PARP1 failed to form detectable PAR chains from supplemented NAD<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>), which suggests that Sam68 stimulates DNA-dependent PARP1 activation and subsequent PAR production."

We detected the association of the full-length, \u0394C, and \u0394KH truncated Sam68 to PARP1, but not GFP control (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal amino acids 1\u2013102 (\u0394N) of Sam68 almost abolished the association of Sam68 to PARP1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), suggesting that the N-terminal residues are critical for the Sam68-PARP1 interaction. Moreover, our pull-down assays using recombinant proteins demonstrated a direct Sam68-PARP1 interaction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In contrast to the strong association between PARP1 and full-length Sam68, \u0394N truncated Sam68 protein barely interacted with PARP1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), which further supports the critical role of N-terminus of Sam68 for the Sam68-PARP1 interaction. To examine the functional importance of the Sam68-PARP1 interaction, we compared DNA damage-stimulated NF-\u03baB signaling in Sam68 KO MEFs supplemented with full-length or \u0394N mutant Sam68. Transient transfection of full-length Sam68, but not GFP control, significantly restored genotoxic stress-induced PARylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), assembly of the PARP1-IKK\u03b3 signaling complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), cytoplasmic degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, and nuclear translocation of p65 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), consistent with our previous observation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013G</a>,<a href=\"#fig2\">2G</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013F</a>). In contrast, despite full-length Sam68 and Sam68 (\u0394N) truncate sharing strict nuclear localization (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), ectopic expression of Sam68 (\u0394N) mutant failed to restore the DNA damage-triggered PARylation, PARP1-IKK\u03b3 signal complex assembly, I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, and p65 nuclear accumulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a>). Moreover, we carried out in vitro PARylation assays using recombinant Sam68 and Sam68 (\u0394N) proteins, to examine the role of the Sam68-PARP1 interaction for Sam68-stimulated PARP1 activation. Consistent with our previous observation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), incubation of Sam68 with PARP1 substantially enhanced PAR formation in the presence of damaged DNA and NAD<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, compare lane 3 with lane 7). However, the stimulatory effect of Sam68 on PARP1 activation and PARylation under the same condition was dramatically impeded by Sam68 (\u0394N) protein (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, compare lane 7 with lane 11), suggesting that the Sam68-PARP1 interaction is essential for Sam68 to stimulate PARP1 activation. Therefore our results demonstrate that the N-terminus of Sam68 is important for the association between Sam68 and PARP1 and the Sam68-PARP1 interaction is critical for DNA damage-induced PARylation and PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling."

CPT- and \u03b3-irradiation-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation rapidly occurred in <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/-</sup> CECs, but was significantly attenuated in <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In parallel, \u03b3-irradiation and CPT triggered p65 nuclear translocation in <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/-</sup> CECs, whereas the nuclear accumulation of p65 was nearly abolished in <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Moreover, in <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/-</sup> CECs, \u03b3-irradiation stimulated the SUMOylation of IKK\u03b3 and migration of IKK\u03b3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, both required signaling events for cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB liberation (<a href=\"#bib39\">McCool and Miyamoto, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Miyamoto, 2011</a>); however, such signaling events was dampened in \u03b3-irradiated <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013D</a>). These results, together with our findings that Sam68 deletion diminishes DNA damage-initiated PARylation in CECs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>), suggest that Sam68 is essential in the nuclear-initiated NF-\u03baB signaling in mouse primary cells."

Indeed, mRNA levels of <i>Birc3</i> (encoding cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1, cIAP1), <i>Bcl2l1</i> (encoding B-cell lymphoma-like-1, Bcl-XL), and <i>Xiap</i> (encoding X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, XIAP) were elevated in Sam68 sufficient CECs and MEFs post \u03b3-irradiation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). However, \u03b3-irradiation-induced transcription of these genes was attenuated in Sam68 KO CECs and MEFs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), in line with attenuated nuclear-initiated NF-\u03baB signaling (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). Moreover, XIAP and Bcl-XL protein levels were enhanced in <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/-</sup> CECs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) and wild-type MEFs (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) following \u03b3-irradiation, whereas such induction did not occur in <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>-/-</sup> CECs and MEFs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In contrast, cleavage of PARP1 and Caspase-3, two known biochemical hallmarks for apoptosis, were elevated in the \u03b3-irradiated <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>-/-</sup>, but not <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/-</sup> CECs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013G</a>), mirroring the inefficient anti-apoptotic gene expression in <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>-/-</sup> CECs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013F</a>). Consistently, more <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>-/-</sup> CECs underwent cell death in response to \u03b3-irradiation than <i>Khdrbs1</i><sup>+/-</sup> controls, as reflected by an irradiation dose-dependent cell loss (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>).

Interestingly, Sam68 levels were elevated in colon tumors, compared to adjacent normal tissue, from the tumor-laden <i>Apc</i><sup>min716/+</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and D</a>). Moreover, the enhanced Sam68 expression coincided with elevated levels of PAR production, phosphorylated p65 (phosphor-p65, indicative of NF-\u03baB activation), and Bcl-XL (anti-apoptotic transcriptional target of NF-\u03baB) in colon tumors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). Similarly, in tissue samples derived from colon adenocarcinoma patients (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>), Sam68 levels were substantially elevated in 16 (94.1%) out of 17 patients, when compared to adjacent normal tissue from the same patient (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013H</a>). Moreover, anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-XL and XIAP were both upregulated at the transcriptional (5 [100%] out of 5 patients) and translational (16 [94.1%] out of 17 patients) levels in colon tumors, in comparison to normal tissue controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013H</a>). Furthermore, the elevated Sam68 levels positively correlated with increased PAR and phospho-p65 levels in human colon cancer samples (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H\u2013I</a>). Therefore these correlative results suggest that elevated Sam68 levels could facilitate PAR synthesis and PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling/transactivation of anti-apoptotic genes to counter intrinsic DNA damage in human and mouse colon tumor cells."

Indeed, knockdown of Sam68 by siRNAs significantly reduced PAR levels in human colon cancer-derived HCT8, HCT116, and T84 cell lines (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Moreover, p65 phosphorylation and Bcl-XL expression were substantially attenuated in Sam68 knockdown cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Furthermore, genotoxic stress-dependent NF-\u03baB activation, as indicated by p65 phosphorylation and ATM phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wu et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) and subsequent Bcl-XL expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) were both significantly attenuated in Sam68 knockdown cancer cells. These results thus suggest a critical role of Sam68 in DNA damage-initiated and PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB transactivation.

Of note, ectopic expression of IKK\u03b2 (SSEE), which constitutively activates NF-\u03baB, substantially rescued the attenuated Bcl-XL expression and the DNA damage-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by reduced PARP1 and Caspase-3 cleavage, in Sam68 down-regulated HCT116 cells (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>), which supports that Sam68 knockdown affects genotoxic stress-induced NF-\u03baB transactivation. Consistently, in contrast to controls, Sam68 knockdown triggered colon cancer cells to undergo spontaneous apoptosis and dramatically sensitized cancer cells to CPT- or \u03b3-irradiation-induced cell death, as conveyed by Annexin-V staining (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G\u2013H</a>). These results thus demonstrate that downregulation of Sam68 lessens colon tumor development in <i>Apc</i><sup>min716/+</sup> mice and sensitizes human colon cancer cells to genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis, in line with the indispensible role of Sam68 in the nuclear-initiated PARylation, NF-\u03baB activation, and anti-apoptotic transcription in mouse and human colon cancer cells."

                        "text": "The NF-\u03baB signaling pathway remains a very attractive avenue for pharmacological intervention, given its crucial function in human health and disease, particularly inflammatory diseases and cancers. In spite of the widespread use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in current-day cancer treatments, the genotoxic stress-induced nuclear NF-\u03baB signaling pathway that leads to NF-\u03baB transactivation is still less defined, than NF-\u03baB activation initiated from cell membrane stimuli (<i>e.g.</i> immune receptors). Herein, we report that Sam68 is a novel regulator participating in the early cellular responses to DNA damage; it does this by orchestrating the signaling cascade that links DNA lesion recognition in the nucleus to NF-\u03baB liberation and activation in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Following genotoxic stress, sophisticated cellular networks consisting of a variety of molecules and post-translational modifications, collectively termed as DNA damage responses (DDR), are crucial for cell-cycle checkpoint control, DNA repair, transcription, and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</a>). Among these, DNA damage-initiated NF-\u03baB signaling and transactivation of an array of anti-apoptotic molecules are pivotal in facilitating cells to 'escape' from the lethal effects of DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib39\">McCool and Miyamoto, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Miyamoto, 2011</a>). Our results demonstrate that Sam68 deletion impairs inducible I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, NF-\u03baB liberation, and subsequent anti-apoptotic gene expression in cells under genotoxic stress. Sam68 interacts with several established molecules including PARP1 and IKK\u03b3 in the nuclear-initiated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and facilitates assembly of the NF-\u03baB activation signaling complex. More importantly, Sam68 plays an indispensable role in DNA damage-triggered PARP1 activation and PAR synthesis, thus controlling the PAR-dependent signaling complex assembly. This is distinct from leukemia related protein 16 (LRP16), a recently reported regulator of DNA damage-induced NF-\u03baB activation, which binds to PARP1 and IKK\u03b3 in a PAR-dependent manner and therefore functions downstream of PARP1 and PAR production (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wu et al., 2015</a>). Previously, PARP1 was proposed to be dispensable for ATM activation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Stilmann et al., 2009</a>). Our results suggest that Sam68 is important for the activation of PARP1, as well as, ATM in DDR. In addition to the currently illustrated major impact of Sam68 on the PARP1/PAR-dependent signaling pathway that leads to NF-\u03baB activation, Sam68 may contribute to NF-\u03baB activation via a direct or indirect effect on the ATM-involved signaling cascade during the cellular response to DNA damage. Our results underscore a previously unknown function of Sam68, a versatile protein that preferentially resides in the nucleus, in the early nuclear signaling cascade following DNA damage. Furthermore, we previously reported that Sam68 is important for the promoter selectivity and transcriptional specificity of NF-\u03baB in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fu et al., 2013</a>). Sam68 could work at both initiating of NF-\u03baB activation and controlling the NF-\u03baB transactivation potential in the DNA damage-induced NF-\u03baB signaling pathway; thus playing a critical role in the genotoxic stress-initiated \u201cnuclear to cytoplasmic to nuclear\u201d NF-\u03baB activation. Of note, tumor necrosis factor/tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF/TNFR) signaling was revealed to be important for a feed-forward response to DNA damage, supported by DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of several well-known components of TNF/TNFR signaling pathway including TRAF2, p62, RIP1, and CYLD (<a href=\"#bib1\">Beli et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, Sam68 has been proposed to be crucial for the recruitment of RIP1 to the TNF receptor in TNF-triggered NF-\u03baB signaling (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ramakrishnan and Baltimore, 2011</a>). The involvement of Sam68 in both TNF/TNFR signaling and genotoxic stress-induced NF-\u03baB signaling indicates that it could be a crucial molecule conferring the crosstalk between TNF/TNFR signaling pathway and DNA damage responses."

These results, along with the previous report that NF-\u03baB-mediated anti-apoptotic transcription executes a protective function to CECs following \u03b3-irradiation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Egan et al., 2004</a>), highlight the pathophysiological relevance of the nuclear-initiated NF-\u03baB signaling and transactivation in colonic cell survival from environmental acute DNA damage.

Aberrant NF-\u03baB activation and elevated expression of NF-\u03baB target genes, in particular those encoding anti-apoptotic molecules, have been acknowledged as key factors facilitating colon cancer survival and development (<a href=\"#bib58\">Song et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Townson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Zubair and Frieri, 2013</a>). Here we report that the levels of Sam68, phospho-p65 (indicative of NF-\u03baB activation), anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-XL and XIAP are all elevated in colon tumors in comparison to adjacent normal tissue derived from genetically susceptible <i>Apc</i><sup>min716/+</sup> mice and human colon cancer patients. Of note, the positive correlation between Sam68 levels and PAR levels, as well as phospho-p65 levels in human colon cancers suggests that Sam68 could be essential for the development and survival of colon cancer, considering the pivotal function of Sam68 in orchestrating the intrinsic DNA damage-initiated NF-\u03baB signaling and transactivation. In support of this notion, knockdown of Sam68, PARP1, and p65 in human colon cancer cells significantly reduces the basal and genotoxic stress-induced PAR production, NF-\u03baB activation, and expression of anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-XL and XIAP, thus leading to spontaneous and DNA damage-induced apoptosis in Sam68-downregulated colon cancer cells. Moreover, genetic deletion of Sam68 and inhibition of PARP1 markedly reduces the development and survival of colon tumors in <i>Apc</i><sup>min716/+</sup> mice, further supporting the pivotal role of Sam68-conferred PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB activation in colon tumorigenesis."

In particular, the PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling cascade is dampened in Sam68 deleted cells, as well as PARP1 knockout cells (<a href=\"#bib60\">Stilmann et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, the reduction in anti-apoptotic gene expression and increase in genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis are observed in Sam68 knockout cells and PARP1 knockout cells (<a href=\"#bib60\">Stilmann et al., 2009</a>), in line with the impeded PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling in these cells. Furthermore, Sam68 knockout and PARP1 inhibition both attenuates colon tumor development in <i>Apc</i><sup>min716/+</sup> mice. Such similarity in the phenotypes of Sam68- and PARP1-deficient cells and animals in response to genotoxic stresses further supports the notion that Sam68 is a crucial regulator of PARP1 in cellular response to genotoxic stress. Elevated Sam68 levels correlate with tumor progression and poor prognosis in multiple cancer patients and overexpression of Sam68 has been proposed as a prognostic marker (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Liao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Song et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>); however, the significance of Sam68 in tumorigenesis is still obscure. Here we report that Sam68 knockdown markedly sensitizes colon cancer cells to genotoxic stress-induced cell death and Sam68 knockout substantially retards colon tumor burden and survival in <i>Apc</i><sup>min716/+</sup> mice, which highlights the pivotal function of Sam68 in tumor development and survival. Importantly, we establish proof-of-concept showing that manipulation of Sam68 sensitizes colon cancer to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. As a key early signaling regulator at the proxy of the nuclear-initiated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, Sam68 could provide a novel target for therapeutics for cancers and other human diseases associated with impaired DNA damage responses."

For immunohistology, after euthanizing mice, the entire colons were excised under aseptic conditions and frozen in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.) media (Tissue-Tek, Elkhart, In). 5-micron frozen sections were cut using a Microm HM 550 Cryostat (Thermo Scientific), collected on coated slides, fixed in paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and blocked with appropriate sera in PBS. After incubating with appropriate antibodies, sections were washed and incubated with fluorescence dye-conjugated second antibodies and 1 \u00b5g/ml of DAPI. Stained sections were washed and mounted under a coverslip using Fluoro-gel with Tris Buffer (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and examined using an Axio Observer fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany)."

Briefly, mice were sacrificed at 3 months of age. Colon tissue was excised, cleaned with cold PBS, opened longitudinally, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (3.7% formaldehyde, 1.2% methanol, 6.5\u2009g/l sodium phosphate dibasic, 4.0\u2009g/l sodium phosphate monobasic) at 25\u00b0C overnight, and stained with 0.2% (w/v) methylene blue solution. The adenomas were quantified and sized under dissecting scope. Average tumor size and tumor load per individual mouse were determined by averaging diameters of all tumors present and summing the areas of all tumors presented in a given mouse, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib14\">Grivennikov et al., 2012</a>)."

Given that PARP1 is required for NF-\u03baB signaling and they show that Sam68 is upstream of PARP1, their interpretation is reasonable. However, they should discuss the possibility that alternatively, or in addition, Sam68 may also be operating via the ATM branch. This is particularly relevant given that the published literature (Stillman et al., 2009) reports that PARP1 activity is not required for ATM activation (see point 2 in re-review).

We showed that Sam68 interacts with PARP1 and IKK\u03b3 in the signaling complex after DNA damage; previous studies from the Miyamoto lab demonstrate that the translocation of IKK\u03b3 and ATM from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is essential for the cytoplasmic ATM-dependent cascade leading to NF-\u03baB activation (Wu et al. Science 2006). Therefore, Sam68 could complex with the cytoplasmically translocated IKK\u03b3-ATM complex and execute additional important functions for NF-\u03baB activation and signaling in the cytoplasm. Based on our results from the subcellular fractionation experiments, we <i>did not</i> observe an obvious translocation of Sam68 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during a 3-hour period following CPT treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Moreover, in our pilot experiments, we failed to detect the interaction between ATM and Sam68, when conducting the immunoprecipitation/immunoblot assays using the cytoplasmic subcellular fraction derived from CPT-treated cells (see the Figure below). These results indicate that Sam68 might not execute an additional function in the cytoplasm via participating in the cytoplasmic ATM-dependent cascade for DNA damage-induced NF-\u03baB activation. Instead, as supported by our presented results, Sam68 plays an important role in the early signaling cascade in the nucleus to facilitate the NF-\u03baB-activating signaling complex assembly. The distinct roles of Sam68 in the different subcellular signaling cascades for NF-\u03baB activation induced by DNA damage versus TNF receptor engagement could indicate the existence of stimulus-dependent post-translational modifications. We have included these considerations in the Discussion."

It is noteworthy that nuclear proteins (including PARP1) and cytoplasmic proteins (including Sam68 (\u0394C) mutant) were lysed together and subjected to immunoprecipitation/immunoblot, when we carried out the structural functional analyses to map the essential domain(s) in Sam68 that confers the Sam68-PARP1 interaction. In the lysed cells without nuclear boundary, Sam68 (\u0394C) mutant and PARP1 were therefore available to each other under this condition. Because Sam68 (\u0394C) mutant contains the required domain(s) to bind PARP1, we observed the \u201capparent\u201d Sam68 (\u0394C)-PARP1 interaction in the immunoprecipitation/immunoblot assays. Of note, similar to the pulldown assays using recombinant proteins, our immunoprecipitation/immunoblot assays only suggest that Sam68 (\u0394C) mutant with the required domain(s) harbors the capability to interact with PARP1. However, in the truly intact cells, as pointed by the reviewers, Sam68 (\u0394C) mutant and PARP1 are preferentially localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, respectively, and they do not interact, therefore ectopic expression of Sam68 (\u0394C) mutant fails to reconstitute DNA damage-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in Sam68 KO cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>)."

Of note, one previous study from the Poirier laboratory showed that ATM possesses PAR-binding motifs thus interacting with PARP1 in DNA damage response and that ATM activation depends on DNA damage-triggered PARP1 activation and subsequent PAR production (Haince et al. J Biol Chem. 2007 282: 16441-16453). We speculate that the attenuated ATM activation could result from the defective PARP1 activation and PAR synthesis in Sam68 knockout cells that we have demonstrated in our other results included in the manuscript, although we could not rule out the possibility that Sam68 may regulates ATM activation directly. Therefore these results also support our claim that Sam68 is a key NF-\u03baB regulator in genotoxic stress-initiated signaling pathway and crucial for DNA damage-stimulated PAR production and the PAR-dependent NF-\u03baB activation."

The differences in our observations and the Stillmann paper could be caused by a variety of factors, such as exposure time of the western blot, the antibodies being used, and likely the difference in the dose of IR used. The 80 Gy dose used by the Stillmann paper is substantially higher than the dose we used (10 Gy), which may result in a saturated DNA damage signal (including the activation of ATM). This could account for the lack of observed difference in the phosphorylation of ATM in the WT versus PARP1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (as well as the untreated versus PARP1 inhibitor-treated cells). We feel these points, combined with the previously mentioned evidence in the Haince paper which suggests that ATM activation is dependent on PAR production, are sufficient to support our data regarding the decrease in ATM activation following Olaparib treatment; however as this is not our main point and does not affect our overall conclusions, we have respectfully removed this data from the revised manuscript."
