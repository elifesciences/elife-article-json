                    "text": "Brief periods of sleep loss have long-lasting consequences such as impaired memory consolidation. Structural changes in synaptic connectivity have been proposed as a substrate of memory storage. Here, we examine the impact of brief periods of sleep deprivation on dendritic structure. In mice, we find that five hours of sleep deprivation decreases dendritic spine numbers selectively in hippocampal area CA1 and increased activity of the filamentous actin severing protein cofilin. Recovery sleep normalizes these structural alterations. Suppression of cofilin function prevents spine loss, deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and impairments in long-term memory caused by sleep deprivation. The elevated cofilin activity is caused by cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase-4A5 (PDE4A5), which hampers cAMP-PKA-LIMK signaling. Attenuating PDE4A5 function prevents changes in cAMP-PKA-LIMK-cofilin signaling and cognitive deficits associated with sleep deprivation. Our work demonstrates the necessity of an intact cAMP-PDE4-PKA-LIMK-cofilin activation-signaling pathway for sleep deprivation-induced memory disruption and reduction in hippocampal spine density."

Structural changes in synaptic connectivity have been proposed as a substrate of memory storage. Here, we examine the impact of brief periods of sleep deprivation on dendritic structure. In mice, we find that five hours of sleep deprivation decreases dendritic spine numbers selectively in hippocampal area CA1 and increased activity of the filamentous actin severing protein cofilin. Recovery sleep normalizes these structural alterations. Suppression of cofilin function prevents spine loss, deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and impairments in long-term memory caused by sleep deprivation. The elevated cofilin activity is caused by cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase-4A5 (PDE4A5), which hampers cAMP-PKA-LIMK signaling. Attenuating PDE4A5 function prevents changes in cAMP-PKA-LIMK-cofilin signaling and cognitive deficits associated with sleep deprivation. Our work demonstrates the necessity of an intact cAMP-PDE4-PKA-LIMK-cofilin activation-signaling pathway for sleep deprivation-induced memory disruption and reduction in hippocampal spine density."

This relationship has led to the development of influential theories on the function of sleep (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tononi and Cirelli, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pavlides and Winson, 1989</a>). Recent imaging suggests that dendritic structure is dynamic, especially during development, with alterations in spine numbers correlating with changes in sleep/wake state (<a href=\"#bib30\">Maret et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yang and Gan, 2012</a>). However, the impact of sleep deprivation or sleep on synaptic structure in the hippocampus in the context of memory storage or synaptic plasticity has not been examined. This is an important issue, as such structural changes in ensembles of synapses have been shown to play a critical role in memory storage (<a href=\"#bib8\">Caroni et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Vogel-Ciernia et al., 2013</a>)."

Also, the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular correlate of memory storage (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mayford et al., 2012</a>), is associated with an increase in spine density in cultured hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib41\">Oe et al., 2013</a>). In addition to a critical function during development (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gurniak et al., 2005</a>), cofilin plays an essential role in synapse structure by mediating both the enlargement and pruning of dendritic spines (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rust, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bamburg, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bosch et al., 2014</a>). The activity of cofilin is negatively regulated by phosphorylation. Specifically, phosphorylation of serine 3 of cofilin suppresses its depolymerizing and F-actin severing activity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bamburg, 1999</a>). Importantly, increased cofilin activity can lead to the depolymerization and severing of F-actin, which in turn results in the shrinkage and loss of spines (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rust, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhou et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Davis et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shankar et al., 2007</a>).

The spine loss in CA1 neurons was accompanied by reductions in dendrite length. This process was readily reversed by sleep, with just 3\u2009hr of recovery sleep normalizing this spine loss and dendrite length. The molecular mechanisms underlying these negative effects of sleep deprivation were shown to target cofilin, whose elevated activity could contribute to spine loss. Indeed, suppression of cofilin activity in hippocampal neurons prevented the structural, biochemical, and electrophysiological changes as well as the cognitive impairments associated with sleep loss. The elevated cofilin activity is caused by the activity of the cAMP degrading phosphodiesterase-4A5 isoform (PDE4A5), which suppresses activity of the cAMP-PKA-LIMK pathway. Genetic inhibition of the PDE4A5 isoform in hippocampal neurons restores LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation levels and prevents the cognitive impairments associated with sleep loss. Thus changes in the cAMP-PDE4-PKA-LIMK-cofilin signaling pathway in the adult hippocampus underlie the cognitive deficits associated with sleep loss. These observations provide a molecular model for the notion that prolonged wakefulness reduces structural signaling and negatively impacts dendritic structure, which is then restored with sleep."

We therefore assessed whether sleep deprivation alters cofilin phosphorylation by Western blot analysis of hippocampus homogenates collected after 5\u2009hr of sleep deprivation. Indeed, 5h of sleep deprivation reduced cofilin Ser-3 phosphorylation, suggesting an increase in cofilin activity in the hippocampus (NSD: 100.0 \u00b1 6.9%; SD: 67.7 \u00b1 9.2%; Student t-test p=0.0090; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

To test this hypothesis, we used a phosphomimetic form of cofilin that renders it inactive, namely cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pontrello et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Popow-Wozniak et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Meberg et al., 1998</a>). Previous work suggested that cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> expression can inhibit endogenous cofilin activity (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shi et al., 2009</a>), through competition with endogenous cofilin for signalosomes where cofilin is activated by means of dephosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sarmiere and Bamburg, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Konakahara et al., 2004</a>). For example, cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> may compete with endogenous cofilin for binding to the cofilin-dephosphorylating phosphatase slingshot (<a href=\"#bib26\">Konakahara et al., 2004</a>). Importantly, cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> expression does not alter spine density under baseline conditions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pontrello et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shi et al., 2009</a>). We expressed either the phosphomimetic cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> or enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), which served as a control, in hippocampal excitatory neurons of adult male C57BL/6J mice using Adeno-Associated Viruses (AAVs) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). A 0.4kb CaMKII\u03b1 promoter fragment was used to restrict expression to excitatory neurons (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dittgen et al., 2004</a>). Virally mediated expression of cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> was observed in excitatory neurons in all 3 major sub-regions of the hippocampus three weeks after viral injection (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>). Western blot analyses of hippocampal lysates 3 weeks after injection showed that the level of virally delivered cofilin was roughly estimated 75% of the amount of endogenous wild-type cofilin and that the amount of wild-type cofilin per se was not substantially affected by expression of the mutant form (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>)."

Likewise, sleep deprivation no longer affected dendrite length (NSD: 1283.0 \u00b1 35.95 \u00b5m, SD: 1250.1 \u00b1 41.19 \u00b5m; Student\u2019s t-test, p=0.5612; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>, for separate apical and basal dendrite\u00a0length analyses see <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

                                "text": "Sleep deprivation attenuates cAMP signaling in the hippocampus through increased levels and cAMP hydrolyzing activity of PDE4A5 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vecsey et al., 2009</a>). Cofilin activity is known to be suppressed by the PKA-LIMK signaling pathway through the LIMK-mediated phosphorylation of cofilin at Ser-3 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lamprecht R, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nadella et al., 2009</a>). We hypothesized that the elevation in PDE4A5 activity, associated with sleep loss, could negatively impact the cAMP-PKA-LIMK signaling pathway by enhancing cAMP degradation, thereby leading to increased cofilin activity. Based on this hypothesis, we also anticipated that blocking PDE4A5 function in hippocampal neurons would make the cAMP-PKA-LIMK pathway, which controls cofilin activity, resistant to the effects of sleep deprivation. To test this hypothesis, we engineered a catalytically inactive form of PDE4A5 (referred to as PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup>) in which an aspartate group located deep within the cAMP binding pocket of PDE4A5 (PDE4A5<sup>D577A</sup>), that is critical for catalytic activity, is replaced with an alanine group (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baillie et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">McCahill et al., 2005</a>). Expression of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> outcompetes the low levels of active, endogenous PDE4A5 from PDE4A5-containing signalosome complexes that specifically sequester it (<a href=\"#bib24\">Houslay, 2010</a>), thereby preventing the breakdown of cAMP in the vicinity of those complexes. We used the viral approach (<a href=\"#bib21\">Havekes et al., 2014</a>) to express PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> selectively in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Four weeks after viral injections, expression of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> was observed in all major hippocampal subregions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013E</a>), and expression was excluded from astrocytes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F\u2013H</a>). Expression of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> did not alter PDE4 activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex or cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Next, we sleep deprived mice for 5\u2009hr and assessed whether the phosphorylation of LIMK and cofilin was altered in the hippocampus. In agreement with our hypothesis, we observed that 5\u2009hr of sleep deprivation reduced both LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation in hippocampal lysates from eGFP mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I,J</a>). PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> expression prevented the sleep deprivation-induced decreases in LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I,J</a>). While expression of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> fully restored the pcofilin/cofilin ratio in the hippocampus of sleep deprived mice to the levels observed under non-sleep deprivation conditions, it should be noted that phosphatases such as slingshot (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sarmiere and Bamburg, 2004</a>) may also contribute to the reduction in cofilin phosphorylation levels under conditions of sleep deprivation. Three hours of recovery sleep was sufficient to restore both LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation levels in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K,L</a>). The latter observation is in line with our previous observations that a few hours of recovery sleep is sufficient to restore hippocampal synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vecsey et al., 2009</a>)."

This allows for a highly orchestrated sequestering of cAMP signaling in specific intracellular domains rather than a general, global degradation of cAMP throughout the cell (<a href=\"#bib24\">Houslay, 2010</a>). We therefore aimed to determine whether the rescue of memory impairments by expression of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> requires the unique N-terminal domain of PDE4A5. To answer this question, we engineered a truncated version of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> that lacks the first 303 base pairs encoding the isoform unique N-terminal domain (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bolger et al., 2003</a>) (referred to as PDE4A5<sup>catnull\u03944</sup>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>) and expressed this mutant in excitatory neurons in the hippocampus using a viral approach. As this species has no targeting N-terminus then, unlike the full length inactive PDE4A5 that displaces endogenous active PDE4A5 from its functionally relevant location in the cell and thereby increase cAMP levels localized to the sequestering signaling complex, this engineered 5\u2019 truncated complex would simply lead to the expression of an inactive PDE4A catalytic unit unable to be targeted like the native enzyme and so unable to exert an effect on localized cAMP degradation in the functionally relevant compartment."

This finding indicates that the memory rescue in the previous experiment was a result of the full length PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> being sequestered to specific signalosomes through the isoform-unique N-terminal region rather than a consequence of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> being unable totarget the functionally relevant complexes sequestering full length PDE4A5.

Here, we use in\u00a0vivo\u00a0rescue experiments to define a critical molecular mechanism by which brief sleep deprivation leads to cognitive impairments. First, we show that sleep deprivation dramatically reduces spine number and dendrite length of hippocampal CA1 neurons without affecting dendritic structure of CA3 neurons. Second, we demonstrate that sleep deprivation increases cofilin activity in the hippocampus, but not the prefrontal cortex, which is a likely explanation for the reductions in CA1 spine numbers and dendrite length. Third, we find that three hours of recovery sleep restores spine number, dendrite length and cofilin phosphorylation levels to those observed in non-sleep deprived mice. Fourth, we show that suppression of cofilin activity in hippocampal excitatory neurons is sufficient to prevent sleep-deprivation-induced decreases in dendritic spines number, LTP impairments, and memory. Fifth, we demonstrate that hippocampal expression of constitutively active cofilin is sufficient to cause long-term memory deficits but not LTP impairments. Sixth, we find that suppression of PDE4A5 function through overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant version of PDE4A5 changes LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation levels caused by sleep deprivation. Finally, we show that hippocampal suppression of PDE4A5 function prevents the negative impact of sleep deprivation on memory consolidation. Thus, our studies demonstrate that changes in the cAMP/PKA/LIMK/cofilin pathway are necessary to cause memory deficits under conditions of sleep deprivation."

Deficits in synaptic plasticity and memory both represent read outs of the impact of sleep deprivation on hippocampal function, but our work does not directly examine the direct relationship between synaptic plasticity and memory, a topic that has been the subject of extensive study and discussion in the literature (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lynch, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sah et\u00a0al., 2008</a>). That care should be taken to directly relate LTP deficits with memory impairments is emphasized by our findings that expression of constitutively active cofilin is sufficient to cause memory deficits while it does not impact at least one form of L-LTP that is disrupted by sleep deprivation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vecsey et al., 2009</a>)."

Even 3 to 4 weeks of chronic stress or systemic delivery of corticosterone does not alter dendritic arborization of CA1 neurons (<a href=\"#bib33\">McLaughlin et al., 2005</a>). It is also unlikely that other factors associated with the procedure to keep animals awake rather than sleep deprivation per se causes the spine loss as our previous work indicated that applying the exact same amount of stimulation in the waking phase (<i>i.e.</i> the dark phase) does not lead to memory impairments (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hagewoud et al., 2010a</a>)."

Importantly, our structural studies reveal that spine loss is reversed by recovery sleep, consistent with this idea.

In this study and our previous work (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vecsey et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Prince et al., 2014</a>), we showed that 5\u2009hr of sleep deprivation attenuates long-lasting forms of LTP in the hippocampus. We observed that expression of an inactive mutant form of cofilin prevented the reductions in CA1 spine number, the impairment in a long-lasting form of LTP caused by sleep loss. It is interesting to note that three hours of recovery sleep not only restores spine numbers in CA1 neurons, but also hippocampal LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation levels. These findings complement our previous electrophysiological studies, in which we showed that such a short period of recovery sleep also restores deficits in LTP caused by 5\u2009hr of sleep deprivation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vecsey et al., 2009</a>)."

Indeed, one reason why hippocampal area CA1 is specifically vulnerable to sleep deprivation may be the high level of PDE4A5 expression in this region (<a href=\"#bib34\">McPhee et al., 2001</a>). Specific PDE4 isoforms are sequestered by distinct signalosome complexes that regulate localized cAMP signaling and impart functionally distinct roles (<a href=\"#bib24\">Houslay, 2010</a>). Impairing the function of PDE4A5 signalosomes through expression of a full length catalytically inactive form of PDE4A5 exerts a dominant negative action, phenotypically identified here as preventing the alterations in LIMK and cofilin signaling caused by sleep deprivation. This makes memory consolidation resistant to the negative impact of sleep loss. Consistent with the\u00a0notion that a key functional role of the isoform-unique N-terminal region of PDE4 isoforms is the targeting to signalosomes so as to exert functionally distinct actions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Houslay, 2010</a>), the hippocampal expression of a catalytically in active version of PDE4A5 lacking the isoform unique N-terminal domain fails to rescue the cognitive deficits associated with sleep loss. The latter observation suggests that the isoform-specific N-terminal domain of PDE4A5 targets this specific PDE isoform to signalosomes that degrade cAMP in the vicinity of complexes that are particularly sensitive to sleep deprivation such as the complexes that contain LIMK and cofilin. Consistent with this, no such dominant negative phenotype is evident in a catalytically inactive PDE4A construct engineered to lack such an N-terminal targeting region."

This hypothesis proposes that sleep functions to downscale synaptic strength that has increased as a result of neuronal activity and experiences during wakefulness (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tononi and Cirelli, 2006</a>). This hypothesis has focused on explaining data from the cortex rather than the hippocampus, but one previously published study has suggested that the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis applies to the hippocampus as well (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vyazovskiy et al., 2008</a>). However, the hippocampus may be unique from the cortex as the hippocampus is involved in episodic memory and in much greater experience-dependent plasticity than anywhere else in the brain and thus our findings may not extend to other areas where synaptic plasticity is not as prominent. Further, the hippocampus also exhibits many distinct forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we examine structural changes in hippocampal neurons and find that extended wakefulness leads to a loss of synaptic spines mediated by a signaling pathway involving cofilin. This suggests that prolonged wakefulness down-regulates synaptic connectivity in the hippocampus. As little as 3\u2009hr of recovery sleep is sufficient to restore signaling through these complexes, suggesting that sleep functions to restore synaptic connectivity. Thus, the signaling pathways that mediate changes in dendritic structure are rapidly impaired by sleep loss and then can be quickly restored during recovery sleep."

Brains were then removed and post-fixed in 1.5% PFA (40\u2009min at RT). After post perfusion incubation in 1.5% PFA, each hemisphere was cut in 130\u2009\u03bcm slices using a vibratome. Slices were collected to multiwell plates filled with PBS. After one hour incubation in room temperature, PBS was removed and slices were stained with a GeneGun (Biorad, pressure: 100\u2013120 psi) using nylon filter (Merc Millipore, 10\u2009\u03bcm, cat. No. NY1004700). DiI bullets were prepared as described (<a href=\"#bib52\">Seabold et al., 2010</a>). After staining, slices were incubated over night at RT in PBS. The next day slices were incubated for one hour in 4% PFA and mounted with DapiFluoromount G (SouthernBiotech). Microphotographs of DiI stained apical dendrites in the stratum radiatum of CA1 area (approx. 100 \u00b5m from cell bodies) were performed in z-stacks using Zeiss LSM 780 (step 0.3\u2009mm, objective 63x, digital magnifications 5x, resolution 1024 \u00d7 1024). Linear density (per mm of dendrite) and size of spines were counted using SpineMagick software. On average 155 spines were analyzed per an animal. Importantly, for the comparison of the spine numbers using golgi and diolistic staining methods we focused <i>specifically</i> on the second and third branch of the apical dendrites as the diolistic staining technique is suboptimal to label and analyze branches farther away from the soma."

Neurons with incomplete impregnation or neurons with truncations due to the plane of sectioning were not collected. Moreover, cells with dendrites labeled retrogradely by impregnation in the surrounding neuropil were excluded. We also made sure there was a minimal level of truncation at the most distal part of the dendrites; this often happens in most of the Golgi studies, likely due to the plane of sectioning at top and bottom parts of the section. The brains were cut at a 80\u2009\u03bcm thickness. With consideration of the shrinkage factor after processing (generally 10\u201325% shrinkage), the thickness of the section is even less, so the visualization of the spine subclass is no issue as we used a 100x Zeiss objective lens with immersion oil, which is sufficient to resolve the details or subtype of the spines for laborious counting. All analyses were conducted by an experimenter blind to treatment."

They found that 5 hours of sleep deprivation can cause a large reduction in hippocampal CA1 spine density, which can be reversed with 3 hours of recovery sleep. Sleep deprivation also causes an increase in the activity of cofilin, which is known to regulate spine morphology. Suppression of cofilin activity prevents sleep deprivation induced spine loss, synaptic plasticity, and memory deficit. Reducing the activity of PDE4A5, an upstream regulator of cofilin activity has similar effects."

The experimental protocol involves training, immediately followed by 5h SD and a probe, 24h after that. This implies that LLTP disruption occurs at least an hour or more after induction of synaptic potentiation or that synaptic potentiation in CA1 normally occurs following the training, during sleep. Thus SD following training might disrupt the putative sleep potentiation as proposed. If the latter is occurring, then synaptic strength, dendritic structure and spine number should increase accordingly from the time immediately following training to 5h following training."

Notably, they examined the effect of hippocampal application of an AAV with an activated form of cofilin3SA and found it sufficient to cause deficits in the memory task but it was without effect on the form of LLTP that was disrupted by sleep deprivation (SD; the spaced 4-train LTP). This dissociation of cofilin effect from SD effect suggests that cofilin activation, while likely to be necessary, is not sufficient to underlie SD induced changes in synaptic plasticity. Further, it cannot be ruled out that the disruption of memory by cofilin activation is mediated by the same mechanism as by SD (for example SD does disrupt the one form of LLTP- is this sufficient to disrupt memory?)."

The first possibility is that sleep deprivation disrupts learning-induced putative potentiation during sleep which may be reflected in increased cAMP/PKA signaling, cofilin inactivation, synaptic potentiation, and the formation of new spines. The alternative possibility is that sleep deprivation leads to cognitive deficits through other mechanisms. Our work focuses on the molecular mechanisms by which sleep deprivation negatively impacts synaptic plasticity and memory. We show that sleep deprivation causes spine loss in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus that is accompanied by reduced cofilin phosphorylation levels, a protein that regulates dendritic spine formation. We find that expression of a dominant negative inactive version of cofilin is sufficient to prevent the spine loss, synaptic plasticity deficits, and memory impairments associated with sleep deprivation. In addition, we show that the changes in cofilin signaling are directly mediated by the phosphodiesterase isoform PDE4A5 that inhibits the PKA/LIMK pathway. Therefore, we have shown that changes in cAMP/PKA/LIMK/cofilin signaling with sleep deprivation are sufficient to cause memory deficits, and our work using genetic manipulations of both ends of the cAMP/PKA/LIMK/cofilin pathway causally links changes in hippocampal PKA/LIMK/cofilin signaling with the spine loss, synaptic plasticity, and memory deficits caused by sleep deprivation."

We focused on functional experiments to manipulate signaling pathways during sleep deprivation.

We analyzed spine density as a final common pathway of cofilin activity. We found that expression of the mutant cofilin prevents the spine loss caused by sleep deprivation.

Cofilin has a variety of functions in the body and, in this regard, the fact that cofilin has not been \u2018deleted\u2019 from the CNS indicates that it has evolutionary important functions that outweigh any negative effects on learning. Indeed, knockout of the cofilin-1 gene in mice is embryonic lethal (Gurniak et al., 2004 Developmental Biology). Furthermore, it is also important to note that structural plasticity is highly dynamic and for this process to be highly dynamic both positive and negative regulators of spine plasticity are required. Cofilin could for example play an essential role updating outdated memories, erasing irrelevant information, extinction learning, and transferring information from the hippocampus to cortical layers for long-term storage (i.e.systems consolidation). However, to date no studies have defined a role for cofilin in these processes."
