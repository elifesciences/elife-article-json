To corroborate this finding, they tested three doses of cimetidine against A549 tumors that had been implanted in mice. While tumors treated with a negative control grew to 3.25 times their original volume, and tumors treated with a positive control (an established cancer drug called doxorubicin) doubled in size, tumors treated with the highest dose of cimetidine grew to 2.3 times their original volume, which was statistically significant. However, xenograft studies are inherently complex \u2013 there is a lot of variability in the length of time it takes a tumor to become established after implantation, and tumors also grow at different rates in different animals \u2013 and the effects of doxorubicin and cimetidine on the growth rates of tumors do not seem very robust from a biological point of view."

However, while the effects were in the same direction as those reported by Sirota et al., they were not significant when a Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Treatment with doxorubicin also reduced the size of the lung tumors compared to a control, but again the effects were not significant. In both cases, however, a statistically significant effect was observed when the dataset from the original paper and the dataset from the Replication Study were combined in a meta-analysis."

There are many factors that could influence the robustness of the xenograft models used in these experiments: batch effects on the efficacy of the drugs used; changes in the properties of cell lines over time; the strains of the mice used, and also their sex; factors related to microbiome and chow; circadian effects; temperature; and the antimicrobials that might be used in certain facilities."

Indeed, the actual tumor sizes observed by Sirota et al. were not diminished by cimetidine at early time points, and the reduction in tumor size at the last time point (the only time point at which the reduction was statistically significant) was only about 30%. This moderate effect size might have contributed to the fact that the effects seen in the replication were similar to those in the original experiments, but not statistically significant (although, as mentioned above, combining data from the two studies did give significant results)."
