It remains unclear, though, how spatial remapping in rodents relates more generally to human memory. Here participants retrieved four virtual reality environments with repeating or novel landmarks and configurations during high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both neural decoding performance and neural pattern similarity measures revealed environment-specific hippocampal neural codes. Conversely, an interfering spatial environment did not elicit neural codes specific to that environment, with neural activity patterns instead resembling those of competing environments, an effect linked to lower retrieval performance. We find that orthogonalized neural patterns accompany successful disambiguation of spatial environments while erroneous reinstatement of competing patterns characterized interference errors. These results provide the first evidence for environment-specific neural codes in the human hippocampus, suggesting that pattern separation/completion mechanisms play an important role in how we successfully retrieve memories."

It remains unclear, though, how spatial remapping in rodents relates more generally to human memory. Here participants retrieved four virtual reality environments with repeating or novel landmarks and configurations during high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both neural decoding performance and neural pattern similarity measures revealed environment-specific hippocampal neural codes. Conversely, an interfering spatial environment did not elicit neural codes specific to that environment, with neural activity patterns instead resembling those of competing environments, an effect linked to lower retrieval performance. We find that orthogonalized neural patterns accompany successful disambiguation of spatial environments while erroneous reinstatement of competing patterns characterized interference errors. These results provide the first evidence for environment-specific neural codes in the human hippocampus, suggesting that pattern separation/completion mechanisms play an important role in how we successfully retrieve memories."

The collection of active place cells in an environment is thought to serve as a \u201ccognitive map,\u201d providing a spatial framework for both navigation and memory more generally (<a href=\"#bib45\">O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Redish, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Moser, 2013</a>). Two fundamental properties of place cells are their stability (<a href=\"#bib55\">Thompson and Best, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hill, 1978</a>) and their environmental specificity, also known as \u201cremapping\u201d (<a href=\"#bib41\">Muller and Kubie, 1987</a>). Without reliable recapitulation of the ensemble of place cells representing a specific \u201cmap,\u201d spatial memory is impaired (e.g., <a href=\"#bib27\">Kentros, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Morris et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McHugh et al., 2007</a>). Remapping, a form of reorganization of hippocampal \u201cmaps\u201d for different environments, is theorized to be a fundamental mechanism to navigation and memory more generally. However, the exact link between memory performance and remapping has yet to be fully established (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jeffery et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Colgin et al., 2008</a>). In humans, invasive recordings from the hippocampus have demonstrated place-coding neurons in single environments (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ekstrom et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jacobs et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Miller et al., 2013</a>). Additionally, the human hippocampal formation is important to episodic memory more broadly (<a href=\"#bib52\">Spiers et al., 2001</a>), with place cells activating during item recall (<a href=\"#bib37\">Miller et al., 2013</a>) and several studies demonstrating the ability to decode both location and episode-specific details from hippocampal fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) patterns (<a href=\"#bib20\">Guterstam et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hassabis et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chadwick et al., 2010</a>). Whether the human hippocampus represents one spatial environment as either the same or different from another, however, \u2013 a cornerstone of the idea that the hippocampus may compute spatial \u201cmaps\u201d as part of a larger role in processing memories\u2014remains unknown and untested."

These processes were predicted by early computational models and are thought to account for the memory interference errors commonly encountered in memory research and our everyday lives (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yassa and Stark, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Marr, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kohonen, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hunsaker and Kesner, 2013</a>). This theory states that pattern separation is a process that makes memories neurally distinct during memory storage and pattern completion a process by which memories are retrieved from a neural cue. Pattern separation and completion are thus thought to be important complements to each other (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yassa and Stark, 2011</a>). Theoretical models and several empirical findings additionally suggest that CA3/DG and CA1 subfields mediate pattern separation and completion in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guzowski et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Leutgeb et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Leutgeb, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bakker et al., 2008</a>).

This property of attraction has the important implication that memories that are neurally similar will compete, producing interference in the case that the incorrect memory wins this competition (<a href=\"#bib10\">Colgin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Shapiro and Olton, 1994</a>). Theoretical models, therefore, postulate the central importance of pattern separation as critical to making memories less similar and thus avoiding interference due to neural attraction. Alternative accounts of memory interference, however, instead argue against a pure pattern separation/completion based account in favor of a model which posits inhibition of interfering memories from executive control regions during memory recall (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson, 2003</a>). This account instead predicts that similar representations can co-exist, but can be selected, maintained, and strengthened by executive control centers during memory retrieval. Therefore, a definitive neural link between behavioral interference, neural pattern separation, and spatial remapping is necessary to resolve this debate and clarify the function of the hippocampus in memory."

We predicted that City 3 would experience slower learning relative to Cities 1 &amp; 2 because all of City 3\u2019s store locations were in conflict with store locations from Cities 1 &amp; 2. Cities 1 &amp; 2, on the other hand, had only 2 conflicting store locations, which could be learned via a simple swap. We found that the slowest learning did occur for the interference city (City 3) as well as the greatest confusion with the similar cities (Cities 1 &amp; 2). In contrast, transitioning between the similar cities (e.g., City 1 to City 2) resulted in little detrimental effect on learning; in fact, learning one facilitated the learning of the other. Finally, no other cities facilitated learning of the distinct city (City 4) nor did learning the distinct city interfere with learning any other city. These findings suggested that City 1 and 2 (similar cities), despite being most similar, were easily distinguished from one another and that City 3 involved a representation prone to interference from similar cities (thus called the inference city). City 4, in contrast, did not interact with the other cities (distinct city) due to its novel stores and spatial geometry (<a href=\"#bib43\">Newman et al., 2007</a>), allowing it to be readily distinguished from the other three cities."

A one-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed differences in performance as a function of city (F(3,54) = 20.9, p&lt;0.001), which was driven by significantly lower retrieval performance on the interference city than all other cities (t(18)&gt;4.65, p&lt;0.0002). No other cities differed from each other in terms of performance, confirming the results of our navigation and map data analysis suggesting that retrieving information from the interference city (City 3) resulted in a tendency to confuse traces with those used in Cities 1 &amp; 2. It is important to note that even though Cities 1 &amp; 2 involved similar representations (with the difference being two swapped stores), performance on these two cities could not be explained by using the same responses between the two cities or the same responses and guessing on the swapped stores (see Materials and methods). These findings support the idea that participants were nonetheless using at least partially non-overlapping representations to retrieve details from Cities 1 &amp; 2."

This approach allowed us to naively identify MTL regions where voxel patterns carried city specific information. Our inclusion of the interference city into this analysis allowed us to address additional questions of pattern separation/completion. For instance, if the reduced retrieval performance of the interfering city could be attributed to insufficiently separated neural patterns where models predict neural competition at retrieval, the classifier should disproportionally misclassify the interference city as one of the similar cities (Cities 1&amp;2) but not the distinct city (City4)."

Testing each city\u2019s classifier performance against chance revealed that the classifier performed above chance on all cities except the interference city (Cities 1, 2, &amp; 4 above chance: t(18) &gt; 3.2, p&lt;0.006, two-tailed).

We note that within our search space, which included the hippocampus, parahippocampal, fusiform, lingual, and inferior gyrus, only this cluster in CA3/DG and CA1 exceeded the family-wise error rate cluster size correction (see Materials and methods). Also, a control analysis that altered the classifier training protocol produced similar results suggesting these results were robust to differing analysis approaches (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, see Materials and methods for more details). This finding confirmed our prediction that, like the rodent, the human hippocampus contains environment specific representations in the CA1 and CA3/DG subfields for the environments that were most easily retrieved (Cities 1, 2, &amp; 4). Additionally, the below chance classifier performance for City 3 and close resemblance of the retrieval accuracy and classifier accuracy seemed to indicate that low behavioral performance on City 3 may have related to lower levels of voxel pattern remapping for this environment."

Here, we predicted that the classifier would misclassify the interference city trials as either City 1 or City 2 on more than 50% of trials (chance level). This would be consistent with our behavioral results, which indicated that the interfering city was most often confused with Cities 1 and 2 during learning (see Materials and methods). This would potentially support a pattern separation/completion account of hippocampal remapping of spatial memory errors. As predicted, interference city trials were incorrectly labeled as one of the two similar cities at levels well above 50% (t(18) = 2.7, p = 0.01, two-tailed, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). This suggested that a disproportionate amount of interference city trials resembled the similar cities. In contrast, trials for Cities 1 &amp; 2, on which retrieval performance was well above chance, were incorrectly classified as City 3 significantly less than chance (t(18) = -8.6, p&lt;0.001 corrected; see <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Overall, these findings are consistent with the idea that retrieval errors on City 3 could be attributed to, at least in part, insufficient differentiation of neural patterns from Cities 1&amp;2."

Therefore, we also examined the link between interference city classifier performance and participant retrieval performance by seeing if the two measures were correlated. We found that interference city retrieval and classifier performance were significantly correlated (r(17) = 0.61, p = 0.006, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>), a result which persisted even when matching the number of classifier training trials for each city (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The link between participants who performed better on the interference city and those that had more readily classified neural representations of the interference city thus suggested that our best performing participants had neural representations that were more differentiated from each other than those of poorly performing participants. Together, the findings from the searchlight classification analysis support the idea that the human hippocampus exhibits environmental specificity. Further, the low classification performance of the interference city, and correlation between behavioral and neural classifier performance, favor a pattern separation/completion based account of memory interference."

We therefore employed a region-of-interest (ROI) based, multivariate pattern similarity (MPS) approach to 1) determine whether different human hippocampal subfields played different roles in spatial remapping and 2) provide more specific alignment with findings from rodents indicating higher neural similarity for the same vs. a different spatial environment."

Because our searchlight classifier analysis implicated CA1 and CA3/DG subfields in exhibiting voxel pattern remapping and remapping in the rodent is predominantly studied in CA1 and CA3/DG, here, we only include data from only CA1 and CA3/DG (for other subfield results, please see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The results of this analysis are presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013c</a>. A 2x4 subfield by city repeated measures ANOVA revealed a main effect of subfield (F(1,18) = 6.93, p&lt;0.02), and a marginal subfield by city interaction (F(3,16) = 3.14, p&lt;0.06). This suggested that CA3/DG tended to exhibit more remapping but also that the pattern of results across cities differed for CA3/DG vs. CA1. Also of interest was whether each city remapping score was significantly different from chance. In left CA3/DG, remapping scores were significantly above zero for Cities 1 &amp; 2 (all t-tests one tailed, t(18)&gt;1.8, ps&lt;0.05 corrected; see Materials and methods) and marginally above zero City 4 (t(18) = 1.6, p = 0.06 corrected). Thus, left CA3/DG MPS patterns indicated higher pattern similarity when participants retrieved spatial distances within Cities 1, 2, and 4 compared to the correlations of the patterns between different cities."

Overall, these findings also confirm the importance of pattern separation mechanisms to remapping in both human CA3/DG and CA1, an issue we consider with greater depth in the Discussion."

This begged the question, if even correct interference city trials resembled the similar cities, did incorrect trials show even greater resemblance to the similar cities than the correct trials? If the representation of the interference city was unstable and easily attracted to the similar cities, then voxel patterns for incorrect interfering city trials should be highly correlated with voxel patterns of correct trials from the similar cities. Conversely, we would not expect to see high pattern similarity between similar cities and interference city trials if they were correctly answered. An important control comparison was included to make sure that this effect could be attributed to interference rather than a general property of incorrect retrieval.

It is also important to demonstrate that regions that carried multivariate information were recruited during the task by showing activation above baseline. To address these issues, we employed a simple univariate model comparing correct responses on each retrieval block against the baseline task (see Materials and methods). We found significant levels of activation across hippocampal subfields (average parameter estimates of CA1, CA3/DG, and subiculum, left hippocampus t(18) = 3.6, p = 0.002, right hippocampus: t(18) = 5.4, p = 3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup>; all t-tests two-tailed), confirming that the hippocampus was broadly activated by our task, consistent with our past work (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kyle et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Copara et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Stokes et al., 2015</a>). We then tested whether MPS differences could be explained based on differences in univariate activation, which would challenge our findings of subfield specific changes in BOLD activation patterns (<a href=\"#bib17\">Etzel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Davis et al., 2014</a>). To test this idea, we performed an 8x4 subfield (left and right CA1, CA3/DG, Subiculum, and PHC) by city repeated measures ANOVA on mean activation. This analysis revealed a main effect of subfield (F(7,126) = 29, p&lt;0.001) driven by larger parameter estimates in PHC than hippocampus proper (t(18)&gt;4.3, p&lt;4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>). Neither of the remaining effects, however, (main effect of city and subfield by city interaction) were significant (F&lt;1, p&gt;0.5). We also specifically tested regions of interest CA3/DG and CA1 with a 2 \u00d7 4 subfield (left CA1 vs left CA3/DG) by city repeated measures ANOVA which revealed no significant effects (Fs&lt;2, ps&gt;0.15). These findings suggest that city-specific differences in univariate activation levels (i.e., greater activation to the distinct city than other cities) could not account for our overall pattern of results."

First, we extend environment specific coding to the human hippocampus using voxel-pattern based analyses. Using a searchlight classifier approach, which naively identified medial temporal lobe regions carrying city specific information, we found a cluster of voxels in CA3/DG and CA1 whose patterns decoded specific cities during retrieval. Next, using an MPS ROI approach which utilized all voxels from a subfield to characterize similarity within and between cities using simple correlations, both CA3/DG and CA1 showed higher similarity within city than between cities. Although past studies in humans have confirmed the presence of location specific coding in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ekstrom et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jacobs et al., 2013</a>), measuring remapping typically requires a large number (&gt;40) of simultaneously recorded cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</a>), which are difficult to obtain in most human studies. Additionally, although past fMRI studies in humans have suggested location-specific (<a href=\"#bib20\">Guterstam et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hassabis et al., 2009</a>), distance-specific (<a href=\"#bib38\">Morgan et al., 2011</a>), and episode-specific spatial coding within a single environment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 2014</a>), demonstrating remapping between different spatial environments in particular has been elusive because altering the environment changes the visual scenes and trajectories experienced by the subject. Here, we dealt with this issue by minimizing visual confounds inherent in navigation by instead having subjects retrieve spatial distances from specific environments during retrieval. Thus, our findings suggest that indeed the human hippocampus contains neural codes that differentiate specific spatial environments."

Here, we probed the neural underpinnings of both successful and unsuccessful disambiguation during memory retrieval. Retrieval of Cities 1, 2, &amp; 4, which were more easily learned and retrieved, were shown to involve orthogonal voxel patterns, as demonstrated by a searchlight classifier and voxel similarity analyses. City 3, however, which contained repeated landmarks but in a novel arrangement from Cities 1 &amp; 2, did not exhibit neural characteristics consistent with remapping or pattern separation, i.e. higher within than between city similarity or above chance classification. Rather, when attempting to classify City 3\u2019s correct retrieval trials, most trials were classified as City 1 or 2, although this effect was reduced for higher performing participants, suggesting that high performers exhibited more stable hippocampal patterns than low performers. Thus, one possible explanation for the poor performance on City 3 is that its neural patterns were insufficiently separated from those of Cities 1 &amp; 2, resulting in a tendency to incorrectly pattern complete to stable representations of City 1 &amp; 2. An alternative interpretation could be to attribute such errors to inhibition failure, for example, insufficient inhibition of City 1 &amp; 2 representations by prefrontal cortex could lead to those being erroneously retrieved when attempting to retrieve City 3 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson, 2004</a>). The inhibition model, though, would not appear to predict low classification of correct City 3 trials and misclassification of these trials as Cities 1 &amp; 2 trials since correct City 3 trials should involve trials in which traces from Cities 1 &amp; 2 were successfully suppressed (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aron et al., 2014</a>) and thus show no correlation with Cities 1 &amp; 2 (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Furthermore, it is not clear how inhibition from higher cortical areas alone could lead to different patterns of suppression across the hippocampal subfields as prefrontal cortex projects primarily to subiculum and entorhinal cortex and not differentially to the CA fields, at least in non-human primates (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goldman-Rakic et al., 1984</a>). Thus, our findings overall support the importance of pattern completion and separation, particularly in CA3/DG, to spatial remapping and appear less easily reconciled with an inhibition-based account."

The relationship between hippocampal remapping and behavior, however, remains unclear from the few studies to address both (<a href=\"#bib10\">Colgin et al., 2008</a>). Part of the issue, as acknowledged in past such studies, is that it is difficult to assay whether a rat \u201cknows\u201d it is in a different environment or not, although dwell time and reversing direction may be important behavioral assays (<a href=\"#bib53\">Spiers et al., 2015</a>). <a href=\"#bib26\">Jeffery et al., (2003)</a> show that in a hippocampally dependent place-reward discrimination task, rodents perform only slightly worse after small environment modifications that induce global (\u223c85% of cells) remapping (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jeffery et al., 2003</a>), suggesting that remapping can occur quickly and have little negative effect on performance. <a href=\"#bib36\">McHugh et al., 2007</a>, in contrast, demonstrated that dentate gyrus NMDA knockout mice experienced less hippocampal remapping between contexts and less behavioral discrimination (<a href=\"#bib36\">McHugh et al., 2007</a>), suggesting that remapping is important to behavior. In the current study, we assessed map drawing performance after each round of spatial exploration, which provided a more direct link to the formation of a cognitive map during navigation. We found that maps of Cities 1 &amp; 2 were easily learned because information could be readily transferred between the two cities. Later, when assessing neural patterns during retrieval, Cities 1 &amp; 2 were shown to have mutually orthogonal hippocampal voxel patterns. In contrast, City 3\u2019s maps were less accurate and took more trials to acquire due to interference from Cities 1 &amp; 2. During retrieval, performance was lower and hippocampal patterns were not orthogonal to those of Cities 1 &amp; 2. However, we found that participants who performed better on City 3 did show voxel patterns that were more readily differentiated from the other cities. Thus, our findings from Cities 1 &amp; 2 appear consistent with the results of <a href=\"#bib26\">Jeffrey et al. 2003</a> as we show remapping between Cities 1 &amp; 2 despite the map acquisition data arguing for shared information between the two distinct representations. Our results for City 3, though, appear consistent with <a href=\"#bib36\">McHugh et al., 2007</a>, with less remapping negatively impacting memory performance. Thus, we think our data provide a potentially important link between behavioral memory performance in humans and measures of remapping and pattern separation/completion."

Specifically, when correctly retrieving spatial distances from two overlapping cities differing only in terms of two swapped stores, neural patterns were uncorrelated to each other and all other cities, an effect primarily shown in left CA3/DG. These findings support a role for CA3/DG in differentiation of competing spatial inputs, suggesting that this subfield in particular may be important for fine-grained discriminations amongst overlapping contexts as a part of a larger role in pattern separation/completion (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yassa and Stark, 2011</a>). We also found that CA3/DG pattern remapping was (marginally) significant for City 4, suggesting that it differentiated the distinct city as well. These findings are consistent with the idea of CA3/DG as a universal pattern separator/completer, with failures linked to low performance on City 3 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yassa and Stark, 2011</a>). In contrast, pattern similarity in CA1 was higher when participants correctly judged spatial distances from a distinct city featuring novel landmarks and geometry compared to retrieval-induced patterns from the other cities. These findings appear somewhat inconsistent with models that suggest CA1 serves as a complement to CA3/DG in pattern separation/completion (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guzowski et al., 2004</a>). Instead, our data appear to be more consistent with the emerging idea that CA1 may play a specific role in detection or representation of novelty (<a href=\"#bib14\">Duncan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Larkin et al., 2014</a>), possibly acting as an important hub for integrating cortical input (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stokes et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Remondes and Schuman, 2004</a>). Although our study cannot provide specific insight beyond this speculation regarding the functional role of CA1, our findings suggest that its role in processing spatial contexts goes beyond a pattern separation/completion function defined by its position between CA3/DG and entorhinal cortex."

Past studies, for example, have found that neural pattern differences may scale as a function of environment dissimilarity, with geometrically more distinct environments showing lower neural pattern similarity than more similar-shaped environments (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stokes et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Leutgeb et al., 2005</a>). In contrast to these two studies, though, we did not employ a continuous measure of environmental similarity and retrieval success hinged on being able to successfully maintain separate representations for the different environments but not necessarily tracking differences in the details of the different environments themselves. Thus, it is possible that our paradigm involved a more discrete form of pattern separation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yassa and Stark, 2011</a>) than would be needed in experiments involving a continuous change between environments. Consistent with the discrete pattern separation interpretation, studies of human episodic memory suggest that even overlapping episodes can be successfully decoded from multivariate patterns in the hippocampus, suggesting that retrieval of even very similar episodes can involve pattern separation-like processes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chadwick et al., 2010</a>). Thus, one possible interpretation of our results is that pattern separation in CA3/DG may not always scale with behavioral details and thus may be a more discrete process that depends on the exact demands required by encoding and retrieval."

This, in turn, would provide insight into the extent to which forming a representation of the different environments involved overlapping, different, or competing representations, as hypothesized. To address this issue, we computed the difference in map drawing scores during city transitions, in other words, the extent to which drawing a map on the last trial of learning interfered with drawing the map of a new city on the first trial (i.e., first drawn map of the new city \u2013 last drawn map of the previous city."

Similarly, transitioning from city 3 to cities 1 or 2 resulted in significantly greater learning costs than transitioning to City 4 (t(33) = \u22122.2, p &lt;0.04). This supports the assertion that City 3 representations interfered with cities 1 and 2. The only city to city transition that did not result in significant learning costs was the City 1 to City 2 transition (two-tailed t-test: t(27) = -1.9, p = 0.07; all other city to city transitions involved significant costs in map drawing performance (one tailed t-tests against zero, t<i>s</i>&gt;\u22123.3, p<i>s</i>&lt;0.007).

Transitioning to City 4 from any other city compared to transitioning from Cities 1 and 2, however, did not differ (t(49) = 1.0, p = 0.3). This suggests that City 4 was likely represented by a new representation entirely. Together, our findings support the idea that Cities 1 and 2 likely involved similar, largely overlapping representations (similar cities), City 3 involved a representation interfering with City 3 (interference city), and City 4 likely involved a novel non-overlapping, novel representation (distinct city)."

Two classifier training protocols were used. The first trained the classifier using all correct trials from one half of retrieval blocks. This method maximized the amount of training data but did not balance the number of trials used to train each city (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). A second classifier training protocol used a random subset of correct trials from each city so that the classifier would be trained using the same number of trials from each city (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Next, the average classifier performance for each searchlight position created a subject specific statistical map. Maps were warped to common space of a template subject using Advanced Normalization Tools (<a href=\"#bib4\">AVANTS et al., 2008</a>). Finally, group-space maps were contrasted and clustered by t-value corresponding to alpha = 0.05. Permutation tests corrected for false positives by providing a corrected p&lt;0.05 cluster size from the distribution of max cluster size of 1000 label-shuffled permutations.

To measure pattern similarity, we identified trials that were correctly retrieved during two separate retrieval blocks. For within city MPS correlations were made between blocks of the same city and for between city MPS between blocks of different cities. MPS values measured the average r value between matching, correctly answered trial pairs for each participant and each subfield (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). The bottom stores of each stimuli were swapped between different testing sessions of the same city, eliminating contributions to within-city MPS from the same motor response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). Because Cities 1\u20133 shared a common stimulus set, within and between city MPS could be calculated identically for these cities. The ability to match stimuli identity for within and between city MPS for Cities 1\u20133 allowed excellent control for visual aspects of the task as any differences in patterns could be attributed solely to retrieval environment. Because City 4 contained novel stimuli, necessitated by our behavioral testing to ensure that this city involved a new representation, between-city comparisons involving City 4 had no logical matching stimuli. Thus, instead of matching trials based on stimuli identity, all correctly retrieved stimuli from City 4 were correlated with all correctly retrieved stimuli from the other city for all possible pairwise combinations. A control analysis calculated between-city MPS forCities 1-3 using the same method as City 4, with all pairwise combinations of non-visually matched triads. This control analysis did not reveal any significant deviations to our effects and thus visual matching was maintained when possible. The significance of the remapping index was tested with a t-test against 0. The family-wise error rate was corrected for using a bootstrapping approach. Ten thousand iterations of t-tests on each subfield and city were performed on randomly permuted data. The distribution of t-values was then used to determine the corrected t-value at a given percentile."

We found a main effect of subfield (F(7,126) = 8.4, p&lt;0.001) and an interaction effect of Within/Between city retrieval and subfield F(7,126) = 2.14, p = 0.04). This suggested that the relationship of within/between city MPS varied by subfield. We then broke down within vs between for each city using the remapping index (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Here an 8 \u00d7 4 subfield by city remapping repeated measures ANOVA revealed a main effect of subfield (F(7,126) = 2.835, p = 0.009) suggesting that MTL subfields varied significantly in their tendency to \u201cremap.\u201d These analyses suggested further investigation was warranted.

Thus, could our results be due to differences in visual features during retrieval rather than city-specific neural representations? Several lines of evidences argue against this possibility. Cities 1\u20133 were perfectly visually matched in terms of what was presented to the participant and how we correlated these triads during our analyses. To provide more detail on the visual matching in our incorrect trial analysis using MPS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) was perfectly visually matched (matched incorrect City 3 trials with corresponding City 1&amp;2 trials vs. matched correct City 3 trials with corresponding City 1 &amp; 2 trials), eliminating a visual confound as a possible counter interpretation. Thus, these findings for Cities 1\u20133 cannot be explained based on a trivial visual stimulus confound."

The pattern of findings based on a visual confound from City 4 alone, however, would have predicted a qualitatively and quantitatively different pattern of results. Specifically, a visual confound would predict higher classifier performance for City 4 and similar performance for Cities 1, 2, &amp; 3. Our pattern of results, however, was that City 3 had lower classifier performance than Cities 1, 2, 4. Thus, the prediction provided solely by a visual confound was not supported by our data. Second, the visual confound would not predict the presence of a performance correlation with classification accuracy on City 3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). Specifically, as we report in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>, classification performance improves with better individual subject retrieval performance on City 3. Thus, together, our paradigm and pattern of findings argue against a visual confound based explanation alone."

The question is important and the methods used to address it are appropriate. The results are interesting and provide a potential advance. My major concern relates to the main findings, reported in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. The authors show evidence that Cities 1 and 2 are classified above chance. The authors interpret this is as being driven by differences in the pattern separation of internal representations of the Cities 1 and 2, since the stimuli are visually matched and motor responses and reversed across blocks. However, the difference between these two cites relates to a swap between the location of two stores, and I wondered whether the above chance decoding of these two cities is driven entirely by trials using these stores. This is important because two different mechanisms might be operating depending on the trial type. On trials where stores appear that did not contain swapped stores the stimuli and response is shared, there is no conflict in memory representation and above chance decoding on these trials I think would be in line with the authors main conclusion: the hippocampal regions separates out the two cities. This mechanism may also operate on the other types of trials containing the swapped stores, but in addition another mechanism may be operating which drives the classification \u2013 resolution of the conflict between the two responses before the response is made. The authors could attempt to address this by re-analyzing the data to test classification excluding trials in which the swapped stores were used, and also analyzing only those trials in which contained one or both swapped stores."

Cities 1 and 2 shared the greatest overlap and were identical except that the locations of a pair of landmarks were swapped. City 3 shared all landmarks with Cities 1 and 2, but they were arranged in a novel configuration. City 4 shared neither landmarks nor configurations with the other three cities. Participants learned the layout of each of the cities through navigation and map drawing in a behavioral session that occurred prior to the scan. During the scan, participants were tested using a 2 AFC judgment of the relative proximity of spatial landmarks to a reference landmark. Judgments were blocked by city. Behaviorally, the study found that performance for judgments in City 3 were impaired relative to all other cities (including Cities 1 and 2 which shared greater informational overlap). The authors used MVPA techniques to infer the properties of hippocampal neural representations that may help to explain the behavioral results. Using a searchlight and pattern-classification approach, they found that classifier accuracy was lower for City 3 than for other cities. They also found that incorrectly classified City 3 representations were classified as City 1 or City 2 representations at greater than chance (50%) levels and that classifier performance was correlated with behavioral performance. They also performed an ROI based pattern similarity analysis of the CA3/DG and CA1 hippocampal subfields where they found evidence of more distinct representations in CA3/DG than in CA1. They discuss the results in terms of pattern separation/completion and environment remapping. The manuscript presents a novel paradigm and analysis for investigating the retrieval of competing spatial environments. The searchlight/classifier analysis provides a link between voxel activity patterns and behavior. However, the ROI based MPS remapping analysis is less compelling and rests on somewhat shaky statistical evidence. The experiment and the results are interesting, but it's not clear that the evidence supports the claims made in the title and Abstract."

The question is important and the methods used to address it are appropriate. The results are interesting and provide a potential advance. My major concern relates to the main findings, reported in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. The authors show evidence that Cities 1 and 2 are classified above chance. The authors interpret this is as being driven by differences in the pattern separation of internal representations of the Cities 1 and 2, since the stimuli are visually matched and motor responses and reversed across blocks. However, the difference between these two cites relates to a swap between the location of two stores, and I wondered whether the above chance decoding of these two cities is driven entirely by trials using these stores. This is important because two different mechanisms might be operating depending on the trial type. On trials where stores appear that did not contain swapped stores the stimuli and response is shared, there is no conflict in memory representation and above chance decoding on these trials I think would be in line with the authors main conclusion: the hippocampal regions separates out the two cities. This mechanism may also operate on the other types of trials containing the swapped stores, but in addition another mechanism may be operating which drives the classification \u2013 resolution of the conflict between the two responses before the response is made. The authors could attempt to address this by re-analyzing the data to test classification excluding trials in which the swapped stores were used, and also analyzing only those trials in which contained one or both swapped stores.</i>"

For the swapped trial analysis we limited City 1 and 2 trials of interest to only those involving at least one store that changed position between Cities 1 and 2 (12 of 20 stimuli). Both searchlight analyses result in a left hippocampal cluster with many of the same characteristics of our original searchlight analysis (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">2</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, a region of interest multivariate pattern similarity analyses (MPSA) reveals converging results with no significant differences according to stable vs. swapped trials (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 3</a>).

However, we were able to expand our searchlight into areas surrounding the MTL including fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal cortex (ITC), where we would not expect significant remapping related effects. Consistent with predictions, we did not find clusters showing above chance environment classification when we expanded the searchlight into these areas.

It is perhaps worth noting, however, that few studies have looked systematically at how pattern separation demands differ as a function of spatial input in humans, although one study in which we manipulated geometrical relatedness did suggest that neural pattern similarity was reduced as a function of more dissimilar geometric details (Stokes et al. 2015). For the cities in our current manuscript, however, we do not have a continuous measure of their relatedness. Thus, exactly how information differences will map onto neural differences is unclear. It is worth noting that several past studies in humans that have used fMRI to decode retrieval of recently learned episodic memories do in fact suggest distinct neural codes, even for partially overlapping memories (e.g., Chadwick et al. 2010). Consistent with these findings, it could be when there is no obvious continuous relationship between environments or stimuli, that pattern separation is more discrete in nature. This idea would be consistent with at least some proposals for CA3/DG function (i.e., Yassa et al. 2011).

Although we did not present thorough evidence for behavioral separation between Cities 1 and 2 in the previous version of the manuscript, we do believe that our data supports this assertion. We designed our stimuli such that trials involving stores that swapped locations between Cities 1 and 2 were over-represented. For instance, 12 of 20 trials involved at least one swapped store between Cities 1 &amp; 2 and 9 of these 12 had a different correct response in City 1 vs. City 2. Therefore, a subject could score a maximum of 55% accuracy in City 2 based on knowledge of City 1 alone, and vice versa and all subjects were well above this threshold. Additionally, even if we assume that subjects correctly answer all trials involving the same response in Cities 1 &amp; 2 and guess on trials involving different correct responses, we would expect chance level accuracy of 77.5% for Cities 1 &amp; 2. All but 2 subjects had accuracy above 77.5% for <i>both</i> Cities 1 and 2 (one scored 77.5% on City 1 and 92.5 percent on City 2; the other scored 72.5 and 57.5 on Cities 1 &amp; 2, respectively). Furthermore, taking the lower performance for Cities 1 and 2 for each subject and testing the result against 77.5%, subjects still performed significantly above chance (t(18) = 5.4, p&lt;0.0001). Thus, based on both the retrieval data (collected during imaging) and the map drawing data presented in the supplemental figures, we believe that we have provided relatively strong behavioral evidence for Cities 1 and 2 do not involve the same underlying representation."

There is no effect of city in the ANOVA and the marginal interaction is likely driven by city 4 in CA1. The paragraph seems to imply that remapping for City 3 within CA3/DG is lower than the other cities because the remapping score in that condition isn't different that 0 while the scores for 1, 2 and (arguably) 4 are different. This sort of analysis isn't statistically sound. It can be interesting to see if results differ from chance, but differences between conditions should be tested directly rather than through an intermediary.

We now perform a resampling-based multiple comparisons correction for these comparisons based on the family-wise error rate to test whether remapping scores are significantly above zero. Bootstrapping was advantageous because it does not make any assumptions about the underlying variance or covariance structure of the data. We performed 1000 iterations of randomly resampling the pool of all within and between-city MPS scores for CA3 and CA1 and t-testing these values against 0. This generated a null t-distribution representing the family-wise error rate. We then computed the 95% percentile of the null t-distribution to yield a p&lt;0.05 corrected t threshold of 1.76 (one tailed t-test). Thus, t-values exceeding this value would suggest that remapping values were greater than zero, or that within environmental neural patterns were greater than between environmental patterns. We have corrected this issue throughout the Results section that deals with our multivariate findings."
