Some of the earliest and most iconic examples of behavioral psychology concern how animals learn, from experience, which stimuli or actions accompany reward (<a href=\"#bib10\">Thorndike, 1898</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Pavlov, 1927</a>). A century later, computational neuroscientists have described neural circuits that underpin such learning. These are based on the mutual interactions between neurons that contain the neuromodulator dopamine and other neurons they connect with, particularly those in a brain region called the striatum. The dopaminergic neurons receive information about predicted rewards, and report back the mismatch between those expectations and the rewards actually received. These \u201creward prediction errors,\u201d in turn, allow the predictions to be updated, a computation known as model-free learning."

Computationally, these capabilities have been understood in terms of \u201cmodel-based\u201d learning methods, which draw on knowledge of task structure to anticipate possible rewards that have never been directly experienced. Due in part to the support for a tidy, closed-loop picture of dopamine\u2019s involvement in reward prediction, researchers have tended to assume that such capabilities arise from some separate, more sophisticated brain system. Now, in eLife, Brian Sadacca, Joshua Jones and Geoffrey Schoenbaum indicate that these more sophisticated learning capabilities instead arise within \u2013 or at least impinge upon \u2013 the dopaminergic learning circuit itself (<a href=\"#bib8\">Sadacca et al., 2016</a>)."

The task, called sensory preconditioning, assesses the rats\u2019 ability to associate a stimulus (for example, a clicker) with a reward without ever experiencing the two together (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). To do so, a rat needs to integrate experiences from two separate training phases. First, in a \u201cpre-conditioning\u201d phase, the clicker was paired with another neutral stimulus (for example, a tone); then, in a \u201cconditioning\u201d phase, the tone (but not the clicker) was paired with a reward. Not only was the clicker never paired with the reward, it was not even paired with a reward-predicting stimulus, since the tone\u2019s relationship with reward was established at a later stage."

This capability is well known; more surprising was that these reward predictions could also be seen in the responses of dopaminergic neurons to the clicker. This result complicates dual-system explanations, which state that model-based inference occurs separately from the dopaminergic reward learning system. It also speaks against the traditional closed-loop account of dopaminergic learning, in which the circuit should only know about reward predictions it has taught itself via direct pairings."

One possibility, supported by a human fMRI study of a similar sensory preconditioning task (<a href=\"#bib12\">Wimmer and Shohamy, 2012</a>), is that associations between the clicker and reward could already form in the conditioning phase (during which the rats learn to associate a tone with a reward). If presenting the tone called to mind the clicker, which preceded the tone in the first training phase, dopaminergic learning could associate the reward that followed with both stimuli."
