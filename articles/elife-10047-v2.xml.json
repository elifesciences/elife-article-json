Currently, to estimate the effects of those conditions on other targets requires either strong modeling assumptions (e.g. similarities among targets) or separate screens. Ideally, data-driven experimentation could be used to learn accurate models for many conditions and targets without doing all possible experiments. We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects. We now show that, with no prior knowledge and with liquid handling robotics and automated microscopy under its control, this learner accurately learned the effects of 48 chemical compounds on the subcellular localization of 48 proteins while performing only 29% of all possible experiments. The results represent the first practical demonstration of the utility of active learning-driven biological experimentation in which the set of possible phenotypes is unknown in advance."

Currently, to estimate the effects of those conditions on other targets requires either strong modeling assumptions (e.g. similarities among targets) or separate screens. Ideally, data-driven experimentation could be used to learn accurate models for many conditions and targets without doing all possible experiments. We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects. We now show that, with no prior knowledge and with liquid handling robotics and automated microscopy under its control, this learner accurately learned the effects of 48 chemical compounds on the subcellular localization of 48 proteins while performing only 29% of all possible experiments. The results represent the first practical demonstration of the utility of active learning-driven biological experimentation in which the set of possible phenotypes is unknown in advance."

What phenotypes would be elicited by these conditions for other biological components is unknown unless either additional screens are performed, or it is already known how effects on one component generalize to others. The risk of not generalizing can be great; drug candidate screens identify compounds that perturb a particular target in a desired way, but their possible off-target or side-effects are not measured during the screening process and are often only discovered late in drug development (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lounkine et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Macarron et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Trist, 2011</a>). In principle, better drug candidates could be discovered by performing experiments for every combination of potential target and condition. However, exhaustive experimentation is infeasible for essentially all biological systems (<a href=\"#bib30\">Murphy, 2011</a>). These indicate the need for a practical method for both iteratively choosing a subset of the total experiment space to observe, and for generalizing the observed results to a potentially much larger set. This type of approach is referred to as <i>active learning</i> in the machine learning literature."

Using simulations, we showed how a predictive model could be learned by incrementally selecting sparse subsets of experiments to perform based on the results from previous sets. The results showed that accurate predictions (of whether a given drug would affect a given target) were learned significantly more rapidly when this active learner was used to guide sequential experiment selection than when experiments were selected at random. The critical assumption of that work was that once an experiment was performed it could be unambiguously assigned to one of a set of known phenotypes. While this may be a reasonable assumption for some cases (e.g. on/off expression phenotypes), for most drug screening systems it is not only difficult to define distinct phenotypes but the general problem of inferring which phenotypes are possible by clustering observations is considered to not have a solution (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kleinberg, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Vapnik, 1998</a>). Thus in order to use active learning for complex, real-world scientific applications, we must demonstrate its feasibility under conditions where the number and types of phenotypes must be estimated as data are acquired during the learning process."

To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to this problem, we performed a pilot study using a small and spatially diverse set of proteins to capture the effects of a modest number of drugs on different subcellular structures (since we lacked the resources to consider all proteins and a large drug library). Note that our goal is to identify whether a given drug perturbs the pattern of a given protein, and symmetrically, which drugs perturb which proteins in a similar manner. In doing so, we do not seek to describe each protein or type of perturbation in terms of a previously described organelle or structure, since previous work has illustrated that some protein patterns are not typical of any single organelle (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen and Murphy, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chou et al., 2011</a>), and some perturbations may not have been previously observed (and therefore not yet named). Similar to the approach taken in screening drug libraries, we considered a small and chemically diverse set of perturbagens in hopes of identifying salient patterns of effects (<a href=\"#bib19\">Inglese et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Macarron et al., 2011</a>). While there is a large literature on chemical library design (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gordon et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Welsch et al., 2010</a>), some of which attempts to make use of observed data or design of experiments (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tye, 2004</a>), we are unaware of methods which have been applied to studying how the behavior of large numbers of <i>targets</i> beyond single classes (e.g. kinases, GPCRs, etc.) are affected."

The crucial distinctions and novelty of this work are that multiple targets and perturbagens were considered at the same time and that the experiment loop (deciding what experiments to perform next) was entirely guided by a machine learning algorithm without human intervention. While active learning and similar ideas have been applied to biological data as post-hoc or retrospective analyses (<a href=\"#bib11\">Danziger et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Liu, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mohamed et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Romero et al., 2013</a>) and while robotically-executed experiments have been carried out (<a href=\"#bib21\">King et al., 2009</a>), to our knowledge this is the first series of active learning-driven <i>prospective</i> biological experiments where the possible answers (e.g., what phenotypes might be observed) were not known <i>a priori</i> with the only constraint being the type of experiment that could be performed."

From fluorescent microscopy images of these cells we chose 48 different clones (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) collectively representing a broad range of location patterns (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We chose an additional six clones, distinct from the above, for independent testing of how well a model learned from the 48 would generalize to unobserved proteins. We also formed a library of 48 different treatment conditions ('drugs\u201d') (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>): 47 chemical compounds suspected to affect some aspect of subcellular trafficking, structure or localization, together with a vehicle-only control (no drug). The clones and drugs were each assigned numbers by which the active learner could refer to them; both the clones and drugs were \u201cduplicated\u201d by assigning two numbers to each, and this duplication was hidden from the learner. The learner was thus presented with a 96\u00a0x\u00a096 space of possible experiments in which an experiment consisted of acquiring images for a given clone in the presence of a given drug. As described in Materials and methods, a new experiment was done when the learner requested it even if an experiment had been done previously for a combination of either of the duplicates of that drug and target \u2013 images were not shared across the duplicates and therefore the learner could not easily uncover the duplications by seeing which images were the same. The rationale for the duplication was to provide a basis for evaluating the choices of experiments by the learner after active learning was completed."

We use the term 'phenotype' to refer to a statistically distinguishable localization pattern that may or may not correspond to a previously described or characterized drug effect; see Discussion. Each experiment was represented by a set of feature vectors corresponding to its images. We clustered these sets such that clusters of experiments with similar feature vectors defined phenotypes (see Materials and methods). The number of phenotypes was determined anew from the data every round; which patterns are statistically different may change from round to round as new images might contain entirely new patterns, might be additional examples of a pattern that was previously not considered statistically significant, or might show a pattern that is intermediate between two previous clusters causing them to become joined. The phenotype assignments were then given to the learner to form a model to make predictions about unmeasured experiments (see Materials and methods). The basis of this predictive model was to group together those drugs that had been observed to elicit the same phenotype for at least one clone and had not been observed to elicit different phenotypes for any clone (and similarly by grouping clones). This grouping reduced the complexity of the problem: each group of drugs or clones was assumed to behave the same; of course, later experiments might reveal that some of these groupings were incorrect. The predictions of the model were therefore that drugs in the same group would show the same effect on all clones in future experiments (and that all clones in the same group would be affected similarly). Using this model of correlations of phenotypes among drugs and clones, the active learner chose a new round of 96 new experiments to be performed. The choice of experiments in a round simultaneously prioritized experiments that would test the greatest number of the groupings (i.e., experiments predicted by the largest groups of drugs or clones) while minimizing the number of experiments that could be predicted from each other (i.e., experiments predicted by the same group)."

We assessed the accuracy of the predictions of a model from a given round using data it had not yet seen: data from the 'completion' experiments as well as from experiments that were performed in subsequent rounds. Each prediction for an experiment consisted of a phenotype from the set of phenotypes observed so far, and was considered correct if a plurality of images from that experiment were closest (in the feature space) to an image from an observed experiment that had been assigned to the same phenotype. That is, for each of the images from an as yet unobserved experiment, the image was found that was closest to it out of all that the learner had already observed. The phenotype that this closest image had been assigned by the learner was given to the image from the unobserved experiment. The number of unobserved images assigned to each phenotype was then counted, and if more images were assigned to the predicted phenotype than any other individual phenotype, the prediction was considered correct (note that the phenotypes themselves may change from round to round).

Given just the images for the unperturbed (no-drug) condition for the six clones, we generated predictions for the remaining 47x6 experiments and assessed them using the same nearest neighbor plurality approach described above. As a baseline accuracy for these predictions, we can consider what predictions we could make without having learned a model. In this case, we have no way of knowing what phenotypes are possible (other than the unperturbed phenotypes), and must predict that no matter what drug is added the phenotype would remain unperturbed. For the six unseen clones, this would lead to an accuracy of 85%, i.e., 15% of the experiments showed a phenotype different from the unperturbed phenotype for that clone. The model from active learning did much better than this, giving an accuracy of 98% (only 5\u20136 out of 282 experiments were incorrectly predicted). As can be expected, the learner\u2019s predictions were also significantly better than expected for random guessing if we are given the set of possible phenotypes (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05, Multinomial test). This high accuracy at generalizing to new clones suggests that the final model had captured quite well the effects of the drugs on the localization of any target (at least for targets somewhat similar to the original set)."

The learner should be able to learn these (hidden) equivalences as its learning proceeds, and eventually avoid performing multiple experiments in the same quad. To illustrate this process, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> shows, for each round, how many experiments were done for each quad and the accuracy of the predictions made at that round for experiments that had not yet been performed (assessed in the same manner as for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). To calibrate these results, in an optimistic setting an accurate model could be learned by performing only ~26% of the 96\u00a0x\u00a096 experiments (see Materials and methods). Presumably an <i>efficient</i> learner should learn regularities quickly and then avoid excessive sampling of each of the (48\u00a0x\u00a048\u00a0=\u00a02304) quads. In other words, once the learner had realized that clone A was similar to clone B, it could do experiments for only one of those clones and then predict that the same result would have obtained for the other. The same holds for recognizing that two drugs are similar. Thus, the extent to which the learner chose to do experiments for only one clone and one drug from the same quad reflects its ability to recognize similarities and thus do experiments efficiently."

These four biological replicates (which we call a \u201cquad\u201d) are outlined in black, and each is shown separately as a sub-box (not outlined) in its quad. The first frame shows the starting point: unperturbed experiments were measured for all clones (white boxes in a single subcolumn for drug 48) and the model predicted that all drugs lead to the same phenotypes. Each model\u2019s classification accuracy on unseen data is displayed for each 96\u00a0x\u00a096 experiment (sub-boxes) in green when correct, and purple when not. For example, the first frame shows that the phenotypes for most drug treatments differed from their corresponding unperturbed condition, and so the overall accuracy was low (more purple than green). By design, the active learner chose the second batch of experiments to evenly sample each drug and clone (sparse white boxes). Those data led to a model with lower accuracy because emphasis was placed on ultimately spurious correlations in phenotypes. In general, the active learner always chose to perform experiments to test presumed correlations in phenotypes, and so there was a substantial increase in accuracy from round 2 to round 3. As additional rounds were performed, the accuracy gradually increased and most quads were only measured once. By round 20, many of the experiments had been correctly predicted and the learner focused on learning the remaining ones. By the last round, most predictions were correct, but the predictions for a few drugs remained largely incorrect."

We therefore asked how well generalization accuracy could be predicted from the degree to which quads were sampled. It is important to note the distinction between generalization accuracy and overall model accuracy: the former is the accuracy of predictions for unobserved experiments while the latter is the combination of the generalization accuracy and the percent of experiments done so far (since we assumed that the results of experiments that had been done were correct)."

Interestingly, there was a benefit of performing three experiments in the same quad, although this happened rarely (7% of the time). We attribute this to the fact that some quads showed greater variation within their experiments than others (data not shown), leading the learner to do more experiments within a quad in order to improve its accuracy. The number of phenotypes generally increased as data were collected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>); part of this was due to learner assigning new phenotypes to account for these hypervariable experiments. Interestingly, the expected reward for not performing any experiments in a quad is positive; this is consistent with there being additional similarities beyond those resulting from the duplications (e.g., some of the clones or compounds are similar enough that some unmeasured quads can be accurately predicted from others)."

To accomplish this while incorporating the efficiency of active learning, we can imagine a process by which an active learner is first used to learn all phenotypes until some stopping criterion is met, and then the acute phenotypes are identified as a secondary task from the actively collected data. For this two-step process, we can apply more stringent quality control after data collection has ceased, in order to remove from consideration low quality images not caught by the initial automated quality control. We performed second step filtering as described in Materials and methods."

To independently assess the extent to which these phenotypes were different, a logistic regression classifier was trained to distinguish the actively learned phenotypes and evaluated by cross-validation; the classifier was able to distinguish all 51 phenotypes in fields not used for training with 75% accuracy. To give a sense of the spread of each phenotype, a randomly chosen cell from a field in the source phenotype (row) that had the median classification accuracy against another phenotype (column) is shown; this field that is chosen can be considered representative of the source phenotype when considered relative to the other phenotype. In this way, visually across a row one sees examples from each phenotype reflective of differences between it and other phenotypes. Phenotypes have been reindexed (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> shows both indices for each drug-clone combination) and placed into groups to facilitate comparisons between visually similar phenotypes; within-group comparisons are outlined by orange squares (the human assigned labels corresponding to each group are shown in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Each phenotype was assigned to one or more drug-clone combinations; groups are ordered from most (top) to least (bottom) frequently assigned to experiments, and likewise within groups, phenotypes are ordered by frequency (right column, color coded by percentile bins: magenta for 1 experiment (25<sup>th</sup> percentile), cyan for 2\u201314 experiments (25\u201375<sup>th</sup> percentiles), and gold for the remainder). 20 phenotypes (39%) are assigned to a single combination of drug and clone; these account for just 1% of the combinations assessed by the learner. These rarely exhibit acute localization, and in only one case (phenotype 37) is this likely due to an experimental artifact (overly confluent fields). For example, in the third group from the top (mostly nucleolar localization), phenotype 9 appears to have condensed nucleolar localization relative to more popular phenotypes 5\u20138, and phenotype 10 appears to reflect smaller nuclei. Phenotype 11 contains some out-of-focus examples, but otherwise has greater cytosolic localization than the other nucleolar phenotypes. Phenotypes 35\u201343 appear to be enriched in cytotoxic responses, and include two phenotypes with confluent fields (36 and 37), however not all fields in those phenotypes are confluent. Some phenotypes are complex, such as phenotypes 20\u201327, which show a range of nominal secretory localization and cell body collapse or block in secretory localization. In general, cells sampled within phenotypes (across rows) are more visually similar to each other than between phenotypes, and phenotype differences are generally due to bona fide (albeit often subtle) localization differences rather than artifacts.

These groups were placed on a common scale by normalizing features within each group by their maximum response. The results are shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, in which for display purposes we clustered the drugs using the average perturbation of each group of clones for each drug. This provides a summary of the extent to which each drug affected the spatial distribution of each tagged protein. Beyond the strong perturbations of the cytotoxic drug conditions (drugs between Latrunculin B 1.25\u00a0mM and 0.31\u00a0mM), the most striking aspect is that nearly all drugs elicited noticeable changes to protein localization patterns in most experiments. These include effects of perturbagens commonly used in cell biology, such as Brefeldin A, on targets other than their intended compartment (e.g. on nucleoplasmic proteins). A two-way ANOVA model fit to these perturbations (taking each drug cluster as a factor, and each group of clones as an independent factor) indicates that these drug and clone groups are all significantly different (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05, Tukey\u2019s range test, Bonferroni corrected)."

The active learner predicted that both cycloheximide and Econazole would affect Fa2h localization, and that they would have different effects. Fa2h has been previously suggested to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eckhardt et al., 2005</a>), and has been observed to also occasionally localize within the nucleus in MDA-MB-231 cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Takeda et al., 2013</a>) although no conclusive evidence has been presented. In our images, we have observed a broad range of phenotypes encompassing these and other localizations. We imaged Fa2h localization over a 4\u00a0hr period (from +2h to +6h after treatment) in a manner otherwise closely resembling the active learning experiment protocol (see Materials and methods). Images of treated vs. vehicle treatments were readily classified by logistic regression (85% accuracy, <i>n\u00a0</i>=\u00a073, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001, one-sided Binomial test against p\u00a0=\u00a00.33, the class-proportional null); see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>. Furthermore, cycloheximide and Econazole treatments were also distinguishable above random guessing (68% accuracy, <i>n\u00a0</i>=\u00a047, <i>P\u00a0</i>=\u00a00.006, one-sided Binomial test against p\u00a0=\u00a00.51, the class-proportional null). Projecting these data onto the two classifiers gives rise to Gaussian distributions for each treatment; consistent with the active learning predictions (and clustering method used), these three conditions have distinguishable distributions. That these classifications are independent of treatment duration suggests that these distributional shifts may be rapidly attained in the first (unmeasured) 2\u00a0hr; we do not have statistical power to reject the possibility that they are in steady state from 2\u20136\u00a0hr thereafter. Taken together, these results confirm our predictions of differences as a result of treatment."

(<b>A</b>) Image features calculated from confocal images (60X) of two treatments (orange squares and green triangles, respectively) as well as the vehicle treatment (purple dots) are reasonably well classified by logistic regression. The resulting 2D projection of the 173-dimensional feature space transforms the distribution of each treatment into a 2D Gaussian (95% confidence intervals as colored ellipses). Consistent with the active screen results, drug treatments are distinguishable from vehicle and from each other. Fa2h exhibits an unusual spread of secretory-associated, or subnuclear (but not nucleolar), and sometimes both localizations in single cells. (<b>B</b>) In order to visually assess the distributional differences between treatments, we can extend the usual visual vocabulary of coarse localization phenotypes (e.g. 'Golgi,' 'ER' and the like) by decomposing the feature vectors of each single-cell image in terms of a fixed set of single-cell images. Each image can be expressed as an additive combination; for example, a cell exhibiting both a subnuclear and small vesicular localization can be linearly approximated by adding together feature vectors of a subnuclear and a separate small vesicular cell. Subtractive cases (B, bottom row) are false colored with red instead of green for EGFP signal. (<b>C</b>) Archetypal cells (top row), chosen by minimax clustering (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bien and Tibshirani, 2011</a>), can be approximately added in different weighted combinations to reveal nuanced differences in condition-dependent localization (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). For each treatment (pair of rows), two cells (leftmost column) and their additive description in terms of the archetypes are displayed. White arrows highlight dim subnuclear signal where visually subtle. Overall, Econazole appears to have the effect of generally enhancing post perinuclear/ER secretory structure localization, whereas cycloheximide generally suppresses ER localization in favor of presumably later secretory vesicular localization."

While our analysis hereto has deliberately avoided the complications and inconsistencies of human-assessed labels, we now wished to provide a description of the Fa2h localization differences in those terms. To do this, we performed an analog of archetypal analysis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cutler and Breiman, 1994</a>) in which we sought to identify a small number (five) of archetypical cells (single-cell fields), each with some human-assessed description of localization pattern, and then described the remainder of the cells as linear combinations of these archetypes; this process is cartooned in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> (see Materials and methods). As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, these archetypes are not trivially described. Two exhibit both extra- and subnuclear localization (but curiously are not colocalized with nucleoi, and objects are too large to likely be Cajal bodies). Even the secretory localization patterns are unusual: in several cells a nonuniform perinuclear and early ER pattern appears present, without concomitant late ER or Golgi-associated structures, and with vesicles seemingly too small to be microsomes. Without further evidence of the other contents of these structures, these assessments are of course speculative. Nonetheless, the overall visual decomposition analysis suggests that phenotypic differences are concordant with the known mechanism of action of the two drugs. We emphasize that these issues of phenotype label ambiguity were completely immaterial to the active learner, which merely required that roughly similar images have roughly similar feature vectors."

Whether these clusters are \u201cbiologically relevant\u201d is a difficult question. For example, a drug may cause a slight swelling in an organelle (such as lysosomes or mitochondria) that would be picked up by our numerical features. Is this a unique, biologically relevant phenotype, especially since the extent of the swelling may be difficult to see visually and may depend on the concentration of the drug used? Regardless of what term we use, we can conclude with confidence that that drug affects that organelle (and perhaps that other drugs may have similar effects). To avoid the issue of nomenclature, we can simply consider the clusters to be what they are: changes induced by drugs that were observed frequently enough to be considered significant. Demonstrating the feasibility of automatically and efficiently finding such effects for large sets of drugs and targets was one of the major goals of our study. It is beyond the scope of our study to further characterize each of these changes, but we suggest that a detailed characterization of each of our observed effects be carried out when using any of the drugs we have studied."

Our concern was that human quality control might bias the experimentation (e.g. subtle phenotypes not obvious to a human might be missed); however our results, particularly phenotype identification, would have likely been improved had we allowed ourselves to monitor the data being collected. Our results also suggest that future active learning projects of this type should directly assess differences in the variation in measurement results for different experiments (i.e., different drug-target combinations), which may require making decisions (i.e., during acquisition) about which combinations require additional image collection."

Future experiments exploiting this generalization of the learned model could result in accurate predictions for novel drug/target pairs to further reduce the cost of discovery for potential drug/target interactions. This is a major benefit of our approach compared to the typical single-target based approaches that are widely used today."

The leaves of the cluster tree corresponded to experiments; each experiment was associated with the set of feature vectors for the images obtained for it, which varied in size depending on how many images passed quality control. A single-linkage clustering over sets of experiments (as opposed to individual feature vectors) was performed; internal nodes of the tree were associated with the union of the set of feature vectors of their descendants. At every level of the tree, a score was computed between each pair of nodes. This score ranged from one (1) (\u201ctotally intermingled point sets\u201d) to zero (0) (\u201ctotally dissimilar point sets\u201d). The score for nodes <i>A, B</i> was computed by measuring the average performance of a 1-nearest neighbor classifier (between <i>A, B</i>) taken over of five (5) independent draws (with replacement), with at most 500 points chosen from each node, and equal numbers of points from each node. The pair of nodes with the greatest score (ties arbitrarily broken) were merged to form a new node in the next level of the tree. The pairwise scores had to be recomputed at each level in the tree for the new node corresponding to the merged nodes; scores for pairs of nodes that were not merged were unaffected. The merging process terminated with a single node, associated with the complete data. The cutoff for the clustering tree was determined relative to five (5) independent data splitting samples. That is, for each data splitting, each experiment was divided equally, randomly and disjointly into two leaves; these were assumed to be equivalent distributions. The goal was to identify a threshold such that experiments at least as similar as the variation within an experiment were clustered together. For each of these data splits, the cutoff for the original clustering tree was set to the average (across data-splittings) score of the least level (greatest number of clusters) where at least 90% of the experiment data splits were coclustered. The original clustering tree was pruned using this cutoff to identify clusters (phenotypes)."

Each round of learning consisted of the following steps. First, the data passing quality control were clustered as described above to form phenotypes. A list of the experiments and their phenotypes were given to the active learner software (written in reFLect [<a href=\"#bib16\">Grundy et al., 2006</a>] and described previously [<a href=\"#bib31\">Naik et al., 2013</a>]). To the active learner, experiments were abstractions corresponding to 'Target,' 'Condition' \u2013 no specific information about these (e.g. their true identities, chemical composition or amino acid sequence, etc.) were used. The active learner used these data make a predictive model, which was formed in stages by the following process. The \u201cinductive bias\u201d of the model is that there are fewer distinct Target-types than targets (i.e. there are likely proteins that exhibit the same phenotypes under similar conditions), and that there are fewer distinct Condition-types than conditions (by similar reasoning). Each Target-type was a set of targets such that they had the same measured phenotype for all conditions they were both measured in. In turn, a Target-type predicted that all of its targets had the same phenotype for all conditions, even if they had not been measured yet. Each target was in one Target-type. Condition-types were similar and constructed using Target-types: between any two conditions in a Condition-type, Target-types did not have different phenotype predictions. Condition-types were identified in one step by solving a constrained logic program to find the smallest overall number of Condition-types, and Target-types were identified by a greedy, iterative pairwise merging approach which first collapsed the greatest overlapping conditions first, and then opportunistically compressed Condition-types if they were disjoint. Predictions \u2013 if they existed \u2013 were a matter of looking up the corresponding Target- and Condition-type for a given target and condition. The active learner used this model to select experiments by the following procedure. Overall, target and condition combinations that the model did not have a prediction for were prioritized, and then the rest were treated equally. Repeatedly, until 96 new experiments were chosen, a random high-priority experiment was chosen; all other unobserved experiments in the same Target- and Condition-type as that experiment were temporarily removed from consideration. If the remaining set was exhausted before selecting 96 new experiments, those unobserved experiments which had been removed from consideration were put back into consideration, and the same process was applied again. In this way, the set of experiments overall maximized the diversity of Target- and Condition-types, which presumably would best test their predictions, given new data. Models were learned anew each round, and so the only 'history' the active learner was made aware of was the aggregate effect of having selected some experiments previously, but not their ordering."

The automated microscope used in the active learning study did not align image fields to center cells, and so to simulate comparable imaging conditions (and any field level feature artifacts) no attempt was made to center cells in fields or to adjust imaging settings (0.4\u00a0s and 0.8\u00a0s exposure for 440 and 488\u00a0nm, fixed gain at 300 (arb. units)). Five (5) fields were taken per well. Sequential wells cycled through each of the three treatments (drugs 16, 4, and 48). 106 fields were acquired over 4\u00a0hr, a period starting from +2\u00a0hr after drug addition, through the +5\u00a0hr timepoint used for the active screen, to +6\u00a0hr. 33 fields were discarded for being low contrast, generally occurring at time points immediately after laser and microscope restarts due to hardware and software faults. SLF34 features were calculated per field as before, and Gram-Schmidt process feature selection was used to select 71 features for further use. Classification was by three-fold cross-validated L2-penalized logistic classification and used all 73 fields passing quality control (1\u20132 cells or cell fragments/field). Archetypical cells were chosen as the centers of the minimax hierarchical clustering (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bien and Tibshirani, 2011</a>) of the SLF34 features of each image containing one cell; the highest level of the cluster tree containing 5 nontrivial (nonsingular) clusters was used.
