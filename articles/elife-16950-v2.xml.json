We have developed and applied Dynamic Organellar Maps, a proteomic method that allows global mapping of protein translocation events. We initially used maps statically to generate a database with localization and absolute copy number information for over 8700 proteins from HeLa cells, approaching comprehensive coverage. All major organelles were resolved, with exceptional prediction accuracy (estimated at &gt;92%). Combining spatial and abundance information yielded an unprecedented quantitative view of HeLa cell anatomy and organellar composition, at the protein level. We subsequently demonstrated the dynamic capabilities of the approach by capturing translocation events following EGF stimulation, which we integrated into a quantitative model. Dynamic Organellar Maps enable the proteome-wide analysis of physiological protein movements, without requiring any reagents specific to the investigated process, and will thus be widely applicable in cell biology."

We have developed and applied Dynamic Organellar Maps, a proteomic method that allows global mapping of protein translocation events. We initially used maps statically to generate a database with localization and absolute copy number information for over 8700 proteins from HeLa cells, approaching comprehensive coverage. All major organelles were resolved, with exceptional prediction accuracy (estimated at &gt;92%). Combining spatial and abundance information yielded an unprecedented quantitative view of HeLa cell anatomy and organellar composition, at the protein level. We subsequently demonstrated the dynamic capabilities of the approach by capturing translocation events following EGF stimulation, which we integrated into a quantitative model. Dynamic Organellar Maps enable the proteome-wide analysis of physiological protein movements, without requiring any reagents specific to the investigated process, and will thus be widely applicable in cell biology."

Prominent examples include the endocytic uptake of activated plasma membrane signalling receptors, to terminate the signalling process (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jones and Rappoport, 2014</a>), and the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of many transcription factors, to regulate their access to DNA (<a href=\"#bib31\">Plotnikov et al., 2011</a>)."

Microscopy-based approaches can provide spatial information on individual proteins (<a href=\"#bib37\">Uhlen et al., 2015</a>), but are limited by the availability of specific antibodies, and are very labour-intensive for analysing complete proteomes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Marx, 2015</a>). Genome-wide GFP-tagging in yeast circumvents the need for antibodies (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huh et al., 2003</a>), but tags may inadvertently alter protein subcellular localisation, which is difficult to control for; in addition, serial imaging of cells for comparative purposes remains experimentally challenging (<a href=\"#bib5\">Breker et al., 2013</a>)."

Metabolically labelled HeLa cells, SILAC light or heavy (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ong et al., 2002</a>), were mechanically lysed following gentle hypo-osmotic swelling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Damage to organelles was minimal, as assessed by leakage of lumenal contents (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Post-nuclear supernatant from light cells was fractionated by a series of five differential centrifugation steps, whereas a total organellar \u2018reference\u2019 fraction was obtained in a single centrifugation step from heavy post-nuclear supernatant. This procedure is highly reproducible, as assessed by protein recovery (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Each light sub-fraction was then combined with an equal amount of the heavy reference, subjected to tryptic digest and analysed by LC-MS/MS. For each protein, we obtained an abundance distribution profile across the sub-fractions. In a typical experiment, approximately 4500 proteins were profiled. Proteins associated with the same organelle have similar profiles, and organelles can be distinguished from one another (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In parallel, the global distributions of proteins across the nuclear, organellar, and cytosolic fractions were obtained by label-free quantification mass-spectrometry, typically covering 8000 proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Briefly, SVMs allow non-linear separation of clusters (<a href=\"#bib38\">Varmuza and Filzmoser, 2009</a>). Optimal boundaries between organellar clusters are determined using marker proteins, with cross-validation to prevent over-fitting. Non-marker proteins falling within the boundaries of a particular cluster are then assigned to that organelle. Since a suitable canonical set of organellar markers was not available, we manually curated a set of over 1000 proteins (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). We chose markers based on their expression in HeLa cells and their well-documented (and ideally unimodal) localization to a particular organelle. Clustering of these markers was visually confirmed with several PCA-based pilot maps (not included in this study). Where necessary, we specifically chose further established markers near the edges of organellar clusters, as these are particularly important for defining boundaries. We applied SVM classification to all six maps individually. The mean prediction accuracy for marker proteins was 94.7% (with full cross validation), demonstrating the exceptionally high level of organellar resolution achieved (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). While marker prediction accuracy does not provide a direct measure of overall prediction accuracy, it nevertheless serves as a useful estimate (see Methods for further details). The average proportion of identical organellar assignments between maps, referred to as concordance, was 93.7% for all proteins, and &gt;98% for three-quarters of the proteins (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

We calculated the protein mass of each organelle by multiplying the molecular weights of constituent proteins by their estimated copy numbers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This revealed that the endomembrane system contributes approximately 16% to total cellular protein mass, dominated by mitochondria (6.6%), ER (4.4%), and plasma membrane (3.1%), with relatively minor contributions from endosomes, lysosomes, peroxisomes and Golgi (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The mitochondria, ER and plasma membrane are themselves dominated by a few highly abundant proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In each case, the 20 most abundant proteins constitute at least 40% of organellar protein mass (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>, and <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 5</a>). For example, the most abundant plasma membrane protein is the 4F2 cell-surface antigen heavy chain (SLC3A2), with 15 million copies/cell. This versatile protein can heterodimerize with several other proteins (eg SLC7A5, another very abundant protein, three million copies) to form amino acid transporters. This predominance probably reflects the adaptation of HeLa cells for fast nutrient uptake to support rapid growth. Supporting this view, all plasma membrane transporters combined (40 million copies) contribute approximately 25% of the total compartment protein mass. Other integral membrane proteins (such as adhesion and signalling receptors) contribute ~30 million copies. Assuming a cell surface area of ~1600 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup> typical of adherent HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fisher and Cooper, 1967</a>) yields an estimated density of 4\u20135 integral membrane proteins per 100 nm<sup>2</sup>, in excellent agreement with a previous biochemically derived estimate of 3 for baby hamster kidney (BHK) fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib32\">Quinn et al., 1984</a>). Within the endoplasmic reticulum, proteins involved in protein folding and quality control predominate (20% chaperones, 10% protein disulfide isomerases). A similar abundance of chaperones was observed in the mitochondria (14%), which exceeds the collective contribution of citric acid cycle components (9%). We detected the five members of the mitochondrial ATP synthase F<sub>0</sub> catalytic complex with the expected stoichiometry of ~3:1 for subunits A/B to C/D/E, and estimate the number of complexes at ~3 million per cell (5% of mitochondrial protein mass). Thus, a picture of HeLa cell anatomy emerges from the quantitative subcellular localization information."

                                "text": "The very high reproducibility of our approach opens the possibility to compare maps under different physiological conditions, to identify protein translocation events. To test this, we investigated the well-characterized process of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) uptake. Following stimulation with EGF, EGFR autophosphorylates, binds downstream factors, and is rapidly endocytosed from the plasma membrane to an endosomal compartment (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jones and Rappoport, 2014</a>). The translocation process is readily imaged using fluorescently-labelled EGF (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). We prepared organellar maps from untreated (control) HeLa cells and from HeLa cells continuously stimulated with EGF for 20 min, in biological triplicate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> provides a schematic of the experimental design; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> shows all six maps). Overall map morphology from treated and control cells was unchanged, however EGFR, which localized to the plasma membrane cluster in control cells, was localized to the endosomal cluster upon EGF treatment, as expected. To identify subcellular translocations in an unbiased manner, we developed a two-stage statistical analysis. For each protein the magnitude of translocation (Movement score) as well as the consistency of the direction of the translocation across biological repeats (Reproducibility score) were assessed. The two metrics were then combined in a \u2018MR\u2019 plot (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>) to identify proteins undergoing consistent translocations. To derive stringent score cut-offs, we took advantage of the maps used to generate our subcellular localization database (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We treated these six maps as a mock experiment in which we would not expect to detect any specific changes, by assigning three maps as 'controls' and three as 'mock-treated'. We determined the most stringent score cut-offs from the MR plot of the mock experiment by defining a region where no false positives were obtained. Applying these cut-offs to the EGF treatment experiment identified four proteins as significantly translocating; EGFR, GRB2, SHC1 and PKN2. Both GRB2 and SHC1 are recruited to EGFR upon EGF stimulation and constitute the first step in EGFR signaling (<a href=\"#bib29\">Oda et al., 2005</a>). Inspection of the maps (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), and classification with support vector machines (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 6</a>) showed that all proteins had moved to the endosome/lysosomal compartment, as expected. Therefore, our approach correctly and specifically identified the major translocation events following EGF stimulation. For a deeper exploratory analysis, we then relaxed score cut-offs to allow an FDR of 10%, and identified 14 further significantly translocating proteins (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 7</a>). These included numerous known downstream targets of EGF, such as RPS6KA3, PIK3C2B and ROCK2, as well as several new candidates (see Discussion). These results validate the use of dynamic organellar maps for the systematic detection of subcellular translocation events."

Weight SILAC L/H ratios by protein amount in the light fraction. Subtract equivalent weighted ratios of the untreated samples from the treated samples to obtain a difference profile of five differences for each protein.

(<b>B</b>) Detection of EGF-induced global profile changes. Nuclear, membrane and cytosolic fractions from the experiments described in A) were subjected to mass-spectrometric analysis using label-free quantification (LFQ). Mean Log<sub>2</sub> LFQ values from triplicate control experiments were subtracted from triplicate EGF stimulation experiments and plotted against Student\u2019s (two-sided) t-test p-value for that difference (a \u2018volcano\u2019 plot). Proteins that increase in abundance in the relevant compartment following EGF stimulation are found on the right-hand side of the plots. Proteins undergoing significant translocations are shown in red, based on cut-offs determined as follows. First, the protein must show a minimum two-fold change in abundance (absolute log-difference &gt;1). Second, the protein must constitute at least 10% of the total pool, either before or after EGF stimulation, in the compartment where it is shown to be changing (as determined from the protein\u2019s global intensity profile; see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Finally, the p-value cut-off was FDR-controlled using the six control maps generated in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> as a mock experiment, in which no true positives would be expected. Three maps were assigned as mock-treated, three as control. For each compartment, a p-value cut-off was chosen such that no false positives would be detected in the mock experiment, but changes could still be detected in the genuine experiment (FDR = 0). This was possible for cytosolic and membrane fractions (-log10 p=2.0 and 3.1, respectively). In the case of the nucleus (-log10 p=2.6), two false positives are expected among the 13 positives (FDR \u2248 15%).

To capture these events, we compared the abundance of proteins in membrane, nuclear and cytosolic fractions (as prepared in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) from control and EGF-stimulated cells, based on label-free quantification (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cox et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Stringent FDR controls were derived using a mock experiment of our six database maps, as above, identifying 26 significant changes in the EGF experiment (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 7</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In agreement with the organellar maps, we detected substantial recruitment of GRB2 and SHC1 to membranes. In addition, we observed recruitment of CBL and UBASH3B, which are also known to bind to activated EGFR (<a href=\"#bib19\">Grovdal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Raguz et al., 2007</a>). Consistent with that, CBL and UBASH3B were not detected in control maps but were found in individual EGF-treated maps, in the endosome/lysosome (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Among others, we identified the known translocation of RPS6KA3 into the nucleus, as well as a surprising number of transcriptional regulators leaving the nucleus (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 7</a>). These included ZCCHC8 and RBM7, the unique components of the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lubas et al., 2011</a>), which targets the exosome to promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTS) for their degradation.

For each translocating protein, we calculated the number of molecules in cytosol, nuclear, and organellar fractions, before and after EGF treatment. Differences were then interpreted as the number of proteins moving between compartments (summarized in <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 7</a>). For example, our data show a significant overall loss of EGFR upon EGF treatment (from 700,000 to 620,000 copies per cell, p=0.0022), suggesting that a proportion of endocytosed EGFR has already been degraded in lysosomes. Approximately 500,000 copies of GRB2 are recruited onto endosomes/EGFR, suggesting a stoichiometry of ~1:1 with EGFR. In contrast, CBL (10,000 copies) and UBASH3B (30,000 copies) are recruited sub-stoichiometrically, as would be expected of enzymatically acting proteins. SHC1 (100,000 copies) is also recruited sub-stoichiometrically. The cell loses three quarters of its Vasorin (a negative regulator of TGFB signalling; 30,000 copies), most likely through plasma membrane shedding (<a href=\"#bib26\">Malapeira et al., 2011</a>). Over 300,000 copies of the actin regulator Palladin are released into the cytosol, and the Rho-effector PKN2 is shifted to endosomes, indicating major cytoskeletal rearrangements. Our data thus begin to provide a quantitative, integrated view of EGF-triggered subcellular translocations at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

In this respect, our database approaches comprehensive coverage, and offers a quantitative view of cellular architecture (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The relative sizes of organelles differ significantly between cell types; the approach presented here allows a comparatively rapid characterization at a level previously only achievable through extensive morphological studies. A future comparison of different cell types will substantially enhance our understanding of cellular identity, by uncovering universal features and specific adaptations.

This ensures reproducibility, and at the same time keeps organelles as intact as possible. Since the preparative aspects are straightforward, several fractionations can be carried out in parallel on the same day, allowing multiplexing and complex experimental designs. Relative to the previous LOPIT approach (localization of organelle proteins by isotope tagging; <a href=\"#bib7\">Christoforou et al., 2016</a>), our fractionation protocol is five times faster (4\u00a0hr vs ~20\u00a0hr), and requires an order of magnitude less starting material (10<sup>7</sup> cells vs 10<sup>8</sup> cells). Most importantly, our method can be used comparatively, and also offers quantitative data on protein abundance; a comparative application of LOPIT has yet to be demonstrated. The peptide labelling strategy allows very flexible use of LOPIT; our method requires metabolic labelling (SILAC), currently rendering it most suitable for dividing cells in culture. However, an application of fractionation profiling to mammalian tissues is possible, since mice can be kept on a SILAC diet (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zanivan et al., 2012</a>); alternatively, a representative mix of SILAC-labelled cell lines may be used to generate the reference fraction (SuperSILAC approach [<a href=\"#bib17\">Geiger et al., 2010</a>]). In addition, mass tagging is in principle compatible with our approach, too, and may thus extend its range of applications in future. A detailed comparison of the methods\u2019 relative advantages and requirements is presented in <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 8</a>."

This exceptionally high level of agreement, across species and cell types, reciprocally supports the very high accuracy of predictions in both datasets."

Proteins predominantly associated with a single organelle have closely matching profiles, and can be assigned unambiguously. In contrast, proteins equally split over two (or more) compartments have mixed profiles, which may be difficult to interpret (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gatto et al., 2014</a>). Here, we assign each protein to the most likely compartment, but potential secondary assignments are also indicated (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>). Furthermore, our two-tiered profiling approach considerably alleviates the dual-localization problem, by separating organellar predictions from quantifying a protein\u2019s nuclear, cytosolic and membrane pools. This allows, for example, the accurate characterization of nuclear-cytosolic shuttling proteins: instead of showing an ambiguous \u2018in between\u2019 state, our approach precisely determines how these proteins are distributed over the two compartments. Similarly, for proteins with a cytosolic and an organellar pool, it allows quantification of the distribution, in addition to identification of the membrane compartment. Of note, our dynamic implementation of maps is generally unaffected by multiple localization difficulties, since we uncouple the detection of protein translocations from organellar assignments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Thus, our approach allows the identification of translocation events, even if they only involve partial organellar transitions."

We correctly captured the endosomal transition of EGF receptor, and recruitment of signalling adaptors. Remarkably, the translocations were detected with extremely stringent FDR control, using cut-offs where we expect no false positives. This supports that our approach is capable of identifying translocation events <i>de novo</i>, without having to filter results based on prior knowledge. Furthermore, in combining the translocation data with protein copy number estimations, we provide a genuine systems-biology approach to EGF signalling at the protein level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Unlike transcriptomic or proteomic profiling, our approach allows detection of cellular rearrangements at very early time points after stimulation, long before changes in protein abundance occur. The entire experiment (triplicate comparisons, six maps) required only five days of mass spectrometry measuring time."

                                "text": "In total, our analysis identified 40 translocation events, including numerous previously unreported movements. Among them are ten major regulators of actin dynamics, such as the kinases ROCK2, PKN2, PIK3C2B, and their downstream targets ADD1 and CTNN1, as well as PALLD, LASP1, and UTRN, suggesting that re-arrangement of the cytoskeleton is one of the major immediate effects of EGF signalling in HeLa cells. For several of these proteins, this study provides the first experimental evidence that they are targets of the EGF pathway (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 7</a>). Our data also reveal an unexpected cross-talk with other signalling pathways; Vasorin-shedding, AHNK and PDCD4 rerouting are all likely to counteract anti-proliferative TGFB signalling, and may serve to enhance EGF activity. Strikingly, we observed several transcriptional regulators leaving the nucleus. While nuclear import of proteins, such as ERK2/MAPK1, is a common downstream effect of signalling, nuclear protein export has been reported comparatively rarely. A possible explanation is that this type of movement is more difficult to detect with conventional approaches, such as microscopy: protein import concentrates the signal in the nucleus, whereas export diffuses it. Taken together, these observations highlight the power of the holistic proteomic approach, which identifies the co-ordinated behaviour of functionally linked groups of proteins, and thus uncovers cellular response modules."

We propose that they will be similarly suitable in the fields of autophagy, membrane trafficking and cellular differentiation, providing a powerful complement to imaging-based techniques. Since they offer an unbiased approach to studying cellular dynamics that does not require prior knowledge, they will also be an effective tool for exploratory investigations of poorly characterized processes. The possibility to combine maps with high-throughput phosphoproteomics data (<a href=\"#bib21\">Humphrey et al., 2015</a>) promises to provide unprecedented views of signalling, by linking the movement of substrates to their phosphorylation status. Moreover, as we have shown here, organellar maps will pave the way for quantitative process modelling in cell biology."

The peptides were separated by a linear gradient of buffer B from 2 to 30% in 130\u2009min followed by washout (ramping to 95% B in 5 min, constant at 95% B for 5\u2009min, ramping down to 2% B in 5\u2009min, constant at 2% B for 5\u2009min). The flow rate was 250 nl/min. The column was operated at a constant temperature of 55\u00b0C. The LC was coupled to a Q Exactive HF Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (<a href=\"#bib34\">Scheltema et al., 2014</a>) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) via the nanoelectrospray source (Thermo Fisher Scientifc, Germany). MS data were acquired using a data-dependent top-15 method, dynamically choosing the most abundant not-yet-sequenced precursor ions from the survey scans (maximum injection time 25 ms, 300\u20131650 Th). Sequencing was performed via higher energy collisional dissociation fragmentation with a target value of 1e5 ions determined with predictive automatic gain control. Isolation of precursors was performed with a window of 1.4 Th. Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 120,000. Resolution for HCD spectra was set to 15,000 with maximum ion injection time of 55 ms. The 'underfill ratio,' specifying the minimum percentage of the target ion value likely to be reached at the maximum fill time, was defined as 20%. Repeat sequencing of peptides was kept to a minimum by dynamic exclusion of the sequenced peptides for 30\u00a0s."

As a stringency filter, we included only those proteins which were identified with at least two MS/MS events (ie without matching between runs) in at least one of the subfractions. All fractions were normalized to the same total intensity. Fractions were then weighted according to protein yields. Since the ONC split was highly reproducible, the same set of weighting factors was used for all maps generated as part of one experiment (0.20 for organellar, 0.32 for nuclear, 0.48 for cytosolic fractions - see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For each ONC triplet, weighted intensities were summed for each protein, to derive whole-cell relative intensities. These were used to normalize the individual fraction intensities, to obtain for each protein a distribution profile over organellar, nuclear and cytosolic fractions (with the three values from a triplet adding up to one). Furthermore, whole-cell relative intensities were later used to estimate protein copy numbers and concentrations (see below, proteomic ruler). Please note that we chose to perform this analysis on intensity data, not LFQ data, as the three subcellular fractions ONC have very different composition.

Generation of a reliable organellar marker set is not trivial, as the subcellular localization of many proteins has not been unambiguously determined. Protein localization is often cell type specific, or dependent on the physiological context, further complicating the selection. Moreover, marker sets need to be extensive, to allow accurate cluster delineation. To our knowledge, there is currently no published widely accepted canonical organellar marker set. Hence, we manually curated such a set, optimized for the HeLa cell line used in this study (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>; 1076 proteins). Our selection criteria for a suitable marker were as follows. A) The protein must be expressed in HeLa cells and be\u00a0identifiable by proteomics. Hence, all markers were picked from the list of proteins identified in the course of this study. B) The protein must have a well-documented and, as far as possible, unambiguous/predominantly unimodal steady state localization. Annotation of subcellular localization was gleaned from the various annotations in UniProt (www.uniprot.org), as well as from the protein\u2019s primary literature. C) The proteins chosen to represent a particular organelle must, more or less, cluster with other markers of this organelle. The function of the markers is to provide a reductionist model of the structure underlying the data; the most important property of a good marker set is hence to provide clusters that are stable over all future replicate maps. To achieve this, we selected suitable markers from several pilot PCA maps (which were not included in this study). We subsequently found their clustering confirmed in the maps presented here. D) Since classification by support vector machines is a \u2018boundary\u2019 method, marker proteins near the edge of a cluster are particularly important for cluster discrimination. Hence, once a core set of markers for organelles was established, we specifically augmented the set by identifying suitable candidates (based on criteria a-c) in the cluster periphery. In many cases, we even chose markers that visibly \u2018interdigitate\u2019 neighbouring clusters in PCA maps. The aim was to obtain the best boundaries, ie the ones that afford the best predictive value for further proteins, and to minimise \u2018unchartered\u2019 space in between clusters. The marker set we provide here should serve as an excellent basis for the generation of maps in other cell types, although some fine-tuning may be required."

First, well-established organelles (Plasma membrane, ER, Mitochondria, Golgi, Lysosomes, Endosomes, and Peroxisomes) were included. In addition, the maps themselves suggested deeper resolution in places; thus, known markers of the ERGIC formed a discrete cluster, which also contained many markers of the cis-Golgi. As cis-Golgi is formed from coalescing ERGIC, this is not surprising. Interestingly, the mid- and trans-Golgi markers formed a separate cluster, and hence we decided to define a combined ERGIC/cisGolgi compartment, separate from ER and Golgi. We also observed a small but compact cluster of proteins known to associate with high-curvature ER (REEPs, Atlastins, and Reticulons). This cluster\u2019s map position is distinct from the much larger main ER cluster. Its vicinity to the ERGIC cluster may suggest that this cluster corresponds mostly to tubular ER structures; but since high-curvature ER markers are also found at the edges of sheet ER, we decided to call this cluster \u2018ER, high curvature\u2019."

Any definition of endosomal compartments through marker proteins is therefore somewhat arbitrary. In our maps, the endosomal and lysosomal clusters are adjacent. We observe a relatively clear division of established pure lysosomal markers (such as lysosomal hydrolases) from known endosomal markers (eg Retromer, Transferrin receptor). Within the endosomal cluster, typical late endosomal markers (ESCRT-0, vacuolar ATPase subunits) are more concentrated near the lysosome-proximal side. This difference in distribution between late and early endosomes is suggestive, but not to the point where it warrants separate clusters for SVM analysis."

Briefly, SVMs are a boundary separation method, which allows non-linear separation of clusters in multidimensional space. First, optimal boundaries between organellar clusters are determined using the marker proteins, with cross-validation to prevent over-fitting. Non-marker proteins falling within the boundaries of a particular cluster are then assigned to that organelle.

The analysis was performed in Perseus software (version 1.5.2.11; www.perseus-framework.org). The marker compartments were imported as categorical annotations. Data were first log-transformed. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was then trained on the marker proteins, to determine optimal classification parameters. A radial basis function (RBF) was used as the kernel. Parameters Sigma (curvature) and C (misclassification penalty) were optimized by systematic scanning, to achieve the minimal overall classification error. 16-fold cross-validation (CV) was used to prevent over-fitting. Classification was then performed with optimal settings on both marker and non-marker proteins. This time, classification performance for the marker proteins was gauged by full (leave-one-out) cross validation, as a reflection of prediction error for each compartment. For the six replicate Static Maps, the results of the full CV are shown in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>. The average classification performance was 94.7% correctly assigned markers.

First, we analysed the set of proteins common to all six static maps, using all (6 x 5) = 30 SILAC ratios to build an SVM model. The prediction performance on the marker set was better than that of each single map (97.5% correct); however, the depth of this \u2018common\u2019 map was substantially lower (3766 proteins vs 4500 in each single map). We therefore employed an alternative approach to combine maps. We trimmed the results from each individual SVM analysis to include only positive scores. Scores were then summed for each compartment and protein across the six different analyses. The top summed score represents a protein\u2019s top cumulative compartment prediction. The advantages of this approach are two-fold: firstly, the full information from all replicate maps is used, not just a reduced common set; and secondly, it focusses on clear positive classification decisions. Thus, if two clusters are well separated in one map, but poorly separated in another, only the information from the better resolved dataset will be propagated. In addition, the procedure takes into account the consistency and number of times with which a protein is classified (eg a protein predicted with a medium score in six replicate maps achieves a higher cumulative score than a protein with only a single strong classification). The prediction performance of this approach is very good (96.5% correctly predicted), clearly exceeding the performance of each of the six individual maps. Furthermore, while it has similar performance to the map combining the proteins common to all six maps, it increased the number of covered proteins by 40% (from 3766 to 5265).

The true prediction accuracy of the classification achieved in this study is hence difficult to gauge. Nevertheless, prediction accuracy of the training set, estimated with leave-one-out cross validation, can be used as a proxy. Thus, for a set of 1000 marker proteins, support-vector machine (SVM) models are built and predictions made 1000 times, using a different combination of 999 marker proteins each time. This essentially simulates the prediction of proteins that are not in the marker set, and ensures that the SVM models have maximum predictive value for non-maker proteins. The marker protein prediction accuracy hence provides an estimate of the overall performance for those new predictions that fall within the boundaries defined by the markers. External validation of our predictions supports this notion: the overall concordance with the recent LOPIT study (<a href=\"#bib7\">Christoforou et al., 2016</a>) is 91.6%; the concordance with experimentally validated mitochondrial proteins (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calvo et al., 2016</a>) is 97%, and hence close to the prediction accuracy of our mitochondrial marker set (98.8%, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Prediction confidence varies between individual proteins (see above, Organellar maps through Support Vector Machine classification), and also varies between organelles. As a conservative estimate of global prediction accuracy achieved in this study, we consider the average accuracy per membrane bound organelle, 92.7% (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

We then performed 15 pairwise comparisons (all combinations of the six maps), including 12 inter-day, and 3 intra-day comparisons (maps 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, and 5 vs 6). Concordance was calculated as follows. First, the set of proteins present in both maps was determined. Next, the proportion of proteins with identical top compartment predictions was calculated, corresponding to the map concordance. The average concordance across all inter- and intra-day comparisons was then determined. As concordance is a function of prediction confidence, we next introduced SVM scores as a further criterion. Scores for individual maps were converted to approximate single map percentile scores, by dividing the summed percentile scores (see above) by 6. Average map concordances were then calculated after filtering for predictions present in both maps with a given minimum score."

It is very important to separate this analysis from the organellar assignment achieved via the SILAC based maps. Many proteins have a cytosolic pool as well as a (peripheral) membrane associated pool. If the cytosolic fraction was added to the organellar maps, it would show these proteins more or less near the cluster of purely cytosolic proteins, but not reveal the organellar association of their membrane associated pool. Hence, we decided on a two-tiered classification, which first quantifies a protein\u2019s global distribution, and then reveals its membrane-bound compartment. The same logic applies for the numerous proteins that shuttle between nucleus and cytosol. Our intensity analysis identifies which proteins are predominantly nuclear or predominantly cytosolic, and which proteins are likely to shuttle between the two (pronounced nuclear and cytosolic pools). Again, inclusion of these data with the organellar maps would not allow the identification of nuclear/cytosolic shuttling proteins."

Cells are lysed mechanically, centrifuged at low speed to obtain the nuclear fraction, and at high speed to obtain the organellar fraction. The supernatant is the cytosolic fraction (see above for details). The nuclear fraction contains essentially all nuclei; this is supported by the fact that we detect over 400 proteins exclusively (&gt;99%) in this fraction, including abundant ones. However, the nuclear fraction is fairly crude, and contains burst or partially lysed cells, as well as some mitochondria; based on the proteomics data, we estimate that it contains ~60% nuclear protein, and 40% protein from other membranes. As a consequence, genuine organellar proteins tend to be recovered partly in the nuclear fraction, and partly in the organellar fraction. The distribution over the two organelles depends on the compartment. For example, lysosomes are released very effectively from cells by our lysis conditions; lumenal lysosomal proteins are typically recovered &gt;90% in the organellar fraction. In contrast, since partially lysed cells will also pellet with the nuclear fraction, and retain large plasma membrane sheets, plasma membrane proteins are typically only recovered at around 45% in the organellar fraction. Most other organelles fall in between these two extremes. The interpretation of the resulting abundance profiles is hence straightforward in some, and more complex in other cases."

We assessed preparation-induced leakage of mitochondria, lysosomes, and ER, by analysing the cytosolic pool of known lumenal marker proteins of these organelles (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) for the six Static Maps (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The underlying assumption is that these proteins should have almost no cytosolic pool if organelles stayed intact during cell lysis; conversely, any cytosolic appearance of markers should indicate the magnitude of leakage. In all three cases, we observed a large proportion of proteins with no cytosolic pool (&lt;1%); a distribution of proteins with small cytosolic pools (1\u20135% for ER and mitochondria, and 1\u201315% for ER); and a small number of proteins with large cytosolic pools (&gt;20%). We interpret these three groups as follows. 1) Some lumenal proteins are attached to the membrane of the compartment, and will not leak if the compartment is damaged. 2) Genuine protein leakage will vary from protein to protein, possibly with size, solubility, binding partners, etc. 3) Some proteins have splice variants with cytosolic localization, giving rise to apparent large cytosolic pools even in the absence of leakage (and this is in fact documented for many of the proteins we observe in group 3). Only the second group of proteins is hence likely to reflect genuine leakage. We therefore calculated the averages from proteins with cytosolic pools between 1\u201320% only, indicating leakage of 3.9% for mitochondria, 2.3% for lysosomes, and 8.3% for ER. These values suggest a very high level of organellar integrity achieved by our lysis procedure. The slightly higher value for ER is also expected, as the reticular morphology and interconnectedness with the nuclear membrane makes it impossible to extract this organelle intact."

If a comparative experiment is performed only once (eg as a pilot experiment), only the magnitude of translocation metric can be calculated. This still indicates all relevant changes, but with a much higher background (ie false positive rate).

Compile the data into a single table, with columns for gene name, unique protein identifier (UniProt ID), and all 30 SILAC ratios from the six maps (3 control, 3 treated).

For each protein, the weighted ratios are summed across the five fractions. Each weighted ratio is then divided by the total for this protein. This results in a distribution profile with five values, which sum to 1. The ratio profiles have thus been converted into normalized profiles, reflecting for each protein the proportion pelleted in each fraction. Apply this transformation to each of the six maps."

Proteins that undergo translocations should have delta profiles with large changes. To determine significant deviations from baseline changes, a multivariate outlier test is performed. The underlying assumption is that in a comparison of two identically prepared maps (eg control vs control), all delta profiles will reflect experimental noise only, and no significant changes are expected. Furthermore, this noise should be Gaussian, and the Delta Matrix hence approach a multivariate normal distribution. This should also largely be true for a comparison control vs treated, were only a few proteins show genuine movement. Consequently, the Delta Matrix should be multivariate normal, with the exception of the translocating profiles. To detect these multivariate outliers, the squared Mahalanobis distance to the center of the data is calculated. This follows a Chi-square distribution with n degrees of freedom (n = number of data points, ie five for the maps). The Mahalanobis distance requires calculation of the covariance matrix. Since this is strongly affected by outliers, a robust calculation is performed, using the minimum covariance determinant method (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fauconnier and Haesbroeck, 2009</a>). Robust distances are then converted into p-Values (ie likelihood of expecting a distance as great, or greater, than the observed one, by chance).

As an example from this study, the EGFR is very central to the plasma membrane cluster in untreated cells, but is on the edge of the endosomal cluster after EGF treatment, in close proximity to the lysosomal cluster, hinting perhaps at a late endosomal compartment, or beginning lysosomal localization.

The global distribution profiles greatly add to this, as many translocations do not include two organellar compartments, but changes in organellar/cytosolic balance, or nuclear/cytosolic distribution. To determine any such global changes upon EGF treatment, we used the intensity data processed with the label free quantification (LFQ) algorithm (Group 3 data, see above). Data analysis was performed in Perseus (1.5.2.11; www.perseus-framework.org), separately for each compartment (organellar, nuclear cytosolic fractions). LFQ intensities were grouped (triplicate control vs triplicate EGF treatment experiments), log transformed, and filtered for a minimum of three valid values in at least one group. Missing values were then imputed from a normal distribution (downshift =2, width = 0.3). A (two-tailed) Student\u2019s t-test was then performed on the difference between control and EGF treatment for each protein. To identify stringent cut-offs for significant changes, we required a minimum 2-fold change in abundance, where the protein must constitute at least 10% of the total pool, either before or after EGF stimulation, in the compartment where it is shown to be changing (the total pool distribution was obtained from the intensity (Group 2) data, see above). An FDR controlled p-value cut-off was determined by treating the six \u2018Static\u2019 control maps as a mock comparative experiment, where three maps were assigned as mock-treated and three as control. The LFQ-analysis was then performed as for the control and EGF treatment maps. For each compartment, a p-value cut-off was determined such that no false positives would be detected in the mock experiment, but changes could still be detected in the EGF experiment (corresponding to an FDR of 0). This was possible for cytosol and organellar fractions; in the case of the nuclear fraction, with optimal cut-offs, 2 false positives are expected among the 13 detected significant changes in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a> (FDR=15%)."

However, it only reveals a fold change in fraction association, which then needs to be placed in the context of the protein\u2019s global distribution. (For example: The LFQ analysis shows that the cytosolic pool of GRB2 is decreased 2 fold upon EGF treatment (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>); however, only the global profile reveals that this corresponds to a drop in the cytosolic pool from 90% to 40%, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). For the EGF experiment, all profile changes can be viewed in the interactive Dynamic database (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 6</a>).\u00a0In most cases, the interpretation of changes in global profiles is straightforward (for example, a cytosolic depletion with concomitant increase in the organellar fraction, as for GRB2; or a nuclear exit with concomitant cytosolic increase, as for NR4A3). The exception is an intra-organellar translocation event involving organelles with very different levels of enrichment in the organellar fraction (see above, \u201c<i>Interpretation of global intensity distribution profiles and their changes</i>\u201d). A good example is the EGFR. Endosomal proteins have a much higher organellar enrichment in the organellar fraction than plasma membrane proteins; a translocation from the plasma membrane to endosomes is thus accompanied by a highly characteristic shift from the nuclear to the organellar fraction (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

In combination these observations are consistent with recruitment of GRB2 to EGFR, with approximately 1:1 stoichiometry, and movement to endosomes/lysosomes.

Firstly, our outlier test is much more sensitive and accurate, as it works on a lower data level, the quantitative mass spectrometry data (rather than on organellar predictions based on these data). SVM predictions, although very accurate and highly concordant between maps, necessarily introduce more noise into the data. This will lead to more false positives, especially for proteins with poor predictions in both sets, and proteins whose prediction may sway between two compartments. In contrast, with the outlier test presented here, it was possible to identify translocation events with an experimentally determined FDR of 0 for the EGF experiment. Furthermore, detectable changes in organellar predictions are restricted to complete translocation events (ie a protein fully translocating from one compartment to another). The outlier test, however, will also identify partial translocation events, ie small but consistent movements on the map, which do not lead to changes in the predicted compartment. Similarly, the SVM-based analysis is limited to proteins which have clear organellar predictions before and/or after treatment; proteins that are not assigned to an organelle cannot be identified as changing. In contrast, the outlier test will identify these changes, even if they cannot be fully interpreted afterwards."

Second, the\u00a0protein may not have a\u00a0clear single steady state organellar association, but multiple equally dominant associations, resulting in a mixed profile that does not closely match any compartment.

For low-scoring proteins near the edge of a cluster, or proteins with an unexpected localization prediction, it may be useful to consider what other clusters are close by. In case the protein was mis-classified, the true association is most likely one of the neighbouring clusters. Similarly, some compartments are closely related, or may even be considered as \u2018snapshots\u2019 along a continuum (eg endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes; ER, ER-Golgi-intermediate compartment, and Golgi). Some proteins may be present in two \u2018adjacent\u2019 compartments, assume an intermediate position, and therefore achieve only low prediction scores for either one. Again, the PCA maps may reveal if this is likely to be the case. As we provide six replicate maps, we recommend comparing a protein\u2019s position across all maps, to check for variability."

                                        "text": "The organellar fraction, which is the basis for compartment assignment, contains numerous abundant non-membranous protein particles, such as ribosomes, proteasomes, the TRiC chaperone, the tripeptidyl peptidase (TPP2), and many more. These are sufficiently large and dense to pellet even at the relatively low speeds used to pellet membrane-bound organelles. This group is necessarily very heterogeneous, as the profiling behaviour of complexes is diverse, depending on size, density, association with other structures, etc. Nevertheless, as our PCA maps reveal, the group forms a cluster that is clearly distinguishable from membrane-bound compartments; we have named this the Large Protein Complex (LPC) cluster. Consistent with the notion that the LPCs contain no membranous compartments, there are almost no transmembrane domain proteins in this cluster (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Within the cluster, individual protein complexes are clearly resolved in many cases (with some examples shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For three reasons, we deliberately did not include any of these complexes in the SVM-based compartment predictions. First, many complexes have only few members, and provide insufficient cluster size for SVM classification. Second, the composition of many complexes is already established; any \u2018new\u2019 assignments are thus likely to have a very high FDR. Third, our HeLa spatial proteome database (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>) includes a \u2018neighbourhood analysis\u2019, which reveals which proteins are fractionating most closely with a query; this very convenient tool can (and has been) used to identify stable protein complexes, as well as their approximate stoichiometry (<a href=\"#bib4\">Borner et al., 2014</a>). So although the LPC cluster is resolved into smaller clusters, we de-coupled this analysis from the SVM based compartment prediction."

                                        "text": "Many of the complexes in the LPC cluster can transiently interact with membranes, including for example vesicle coat proteins such as clathrin, COPI, COPII. Organellar maps through fractionation profiling reveal only the majority steady state distribution of a protein; hence, if a complex is predominantly cytosolic, and only a relatively small proportion membrane-bound, the complex will be in the LPC class. Ribosomes are another case in point. Based on quantitative electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib2\">Attardi et al., 1969</a>), only 15\u201320% of ribosomes are attached to the ER membranes in HeLa cells, the remainder are \u2018free\u2019. Consistent with these data, our analysis shows ribosomes in the LPC cluster, and not in the ER cluster. Furthermore, proteins may be affiliated with more than one complex, and show an \u2018in between\u2019 distribution that is not directly interpretable (for example SEC13, which has a known function in the nuclear pore complex, and in the COPII coat). We also noticed the presence of many nuclear proteins in the LPC cluster (eg histones). These proteins tend to have large nuclear pools in the membrane/nucleus/cytosol split, indicating that they are indeed predominantly nuclear in HeLa cells. Some of these proteins may well have a genuine small cytosolic pool; in addition, their presence may be due to a limited amount of nuclear breakage. We also noticed that many LPC proteins are RNA binding proteins, and it is very likely that they pellet as part of large assemblies on RNA. Finally, there are some proteins in the LPC class that are not known to be clearly associated with a particular complex, and the reasons for their presence in the LPC are currently unclear; a potential explanation is that some (abundant) soluble proteins may non-specifically stick to membranes or other complexes, giving rise to \u2018rogue\u2019 profiles. However, non-specific aggregation should not lead to consistent predictions of protein \u2018neighbourhoods\u2019, and we suggest that proteins with close neighbours are more likely to be engaged in specific complexes. The bottom line is that any protein in the LPC fraction must be associated with a particle/structure large and dense enough to pellet at ~80,000\u2009g (the maximum speed of the fractionation protocol)."

The basic strategy is to use differential centrifugation of a 'light' labeled cell lysate and compare it to a 'heavy' reference. The quantitative profiles of abundances across the different fractions provide a signature for that protein's cellular location. The procedure can be tracked in differentially treated cells to monitor changes in location, with the quantitative nature of the entire process revealing estimates of absolute protein abundances. The authors have also developed a set of interactive tools, both a web-based graphical user interface, and interactive excel-based worksheets that enable rapid examination of proteins of interest and provide a wealth of data including subcellular localization as well as estimations of absolute copy numbers. The authors provide in-depth discussions of each component of the actual mass-spec method as well as all subsequent bioinformatic analyses within the supplemental materials, making duplication of the approach, at least in principle, achievable by any lab with unfettered access to high resolution mass spectrometry instrumentation."

The authors acknowledge as much in their nice description of how markers were chosen. The authors claim a 94.7% predication accuracy based on these makers. However, an unknown subset of these markers were chosen based on their ability to localize to discrete subcellular structures based on pilot experiments using the same proteomic approach. This generates a circular logic where markers that already show specific locations validate the same markers. I understand the need to choose appropriate markers, and the currently available list of markers may or may not be sufficient for such approaches, but the authors should be more explicit about how this was done in the main text. To their credit, the authors are forthright about this in the supplemental information."

This essentially simulates the prediction of proteins that are not in the training set, and ensures that the support-vector machine models have maximum predictive value for non-maker proteins. The marker protein prediction accuracy is hence an indicator of the overall performance for those new predictions that fall within the boundaries defined by the markers."

Our database of (8,700 entries) covers the majority of the HeLa proteome (estimated at around 10,000). This includes over 2,000 proteins that are almost exclusively cytosolic and/or nuclear; consequently, these have no organellar profiles, and their localization is directly inferred from their global (cytosolic/nuclear) distribution. Since we applied very stringent quality criteria to the mass spectrometry data for the organellar profiling analysis, there are also several hundred \u2018orphaned\u2019 membrane-associated proteins that were not sufficiently abundant for accurate mapping. Our two-tiered approach nevertheless allowed us to provide some spatial information for these proteins, including the nuclear/organellar/cytosolic distribution as well as copy number and cellular concentration. At the individual protein localization level, our coverage is hence substantial, albeit not complete. On the other hand, our database accounts for the vast majority of total cell protein mass; the cumulative protein mass plots in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> all plateau, suggesting that further identified proteins would be of low abundance, and add minimally to overall organellar mass and copy number composition. In that sense, our coverage is \u2018comprehensive\u2019, which is critically important for the organellar modelling shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>."

Firstly, although they have a prediction for LPC, the large nuclear pool of these proteins, as determined in the global distribution, indicates that they are predominantly nuclear. Their presence in the LPC cluster suggests that some may well have a genuine cytosolic pool; alternatively, their presence may also be due to a small amount of nuclear breakage. Either way, these proteins behave like large protein complexes during fractionation, defined as pelleting substantially at 80,000 g. While we cannot rule out that in some cases this may be due to aggregation, non-specific aggregation would not lead to consistent predictions of protein \u2018neighbourhoods\u2019, and we suggest that proteins with close neighbours are indeed likely to be engaged in specific complexes. Furthermore, we noticed that many LPC proteins are RNA binding proteins, and it is very likely that they pellet as part of large assemblies on RNA. In the original submission, we devoted a paragraph to the interpretation of the LPC cluster (Methods). We have now augmented this paragraph to include a new section dedicated to the presence of nuclear proteins in the LPC cluster."
