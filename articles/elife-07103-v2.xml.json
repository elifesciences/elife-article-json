In order to gain better insight into the genetic processes that underlie variation in complex phenotypes in primates, we must have access to faithful model systems for a wide range of cell types. To facilitate this, we generated a panel of 7 fully characterized chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines derived from healthy donors. To demonstrate the utility of comparative iPSC panels, we collected RNA-sequencing and DNA methylation data from the chimpanzee iPSCs and the corresponding fibroblast lines, as well as from 7 human iPSCs and their source lines, which encompass multiple populations and cell types. We observe much less within-species variation in iPSCs than in somatic cells, indicating the reprogramming process erases many inter-individual differences. The low within-species regulatory variation in iPSCs allowed us to identify many novel inter-species regulatory differences of small magnitude."

In order to gain better insight into the genetic processes that underlie variation in complex phenotypes in primates, we must have access to faithful model systems for a wide range of cell types. To facilitate this, we generated a panel of 7 fully characterized chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines derived from healthy donors. To demonstrate the utility of comparative iPSC panels, we collected RNA-sequencing and DNA methylation data from the chimpanzee iPSCs and the corresponding fibroblast lines, as well as from 7 human iPSCs and their source lines, which encompass multiple populations and cell types. We observe much less within-species variation in iPSCs than in somatic cells, indicating the reprogramming process erases many inter-individual differences. The low within-species regulatory variation in iPSCs allowed us to identify many novel inter-species regulatory differences of small magnitude."

Such comparative studies can also reveal how genomes are modified in species-specific ways to regulate gene activity. The genomes of humans and chimpanzees are very similar in sequence. It is therefore likely that differing patterns of gene regulation underlie many of the differences observed between the two species. However, only a few kinds of chimpanzee cell that can be grown in the laboratory are available for research; this lack of samples has limited the ability of researchers to perform such comparative studies."

The chimpanzee iPSC lines were found to be much more similar to each other than the mature cells that were used to make them. Similar results were also observed for the human iSPCs, which likely reflects the conserved changes that take place when the genomes of mature cells are reprogrammed to pluripotency."

In spite of their clear potential to inform our understanding of both human evolution and disease, practical and ethical concerns surrounding working with non-human primates have constrained the field to using a limited set of cell types collected in a non-invasive or minimally invasive manner, primarily lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and fibroblasts. Comparative studies of any other primate tissue have been limited to using post-mortem (typically frozen) materials, thereby precluding most experimental manipulation and yielding primarily observational insights (see, e.g., <a href=\"#bib8\">Blekhman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blekhman et al. 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Brawand et al., 2011</a>)."

The typical approach involves the introduction of sequences of evolutionary interest into a model system, and then searching for spatial or temporal differences in gene expression that can be ascribed to the introduced sequence (<a href=\"#bib26\">Enard et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Cotney et al., 2013</a>). This is a difficult and challenging approach and, perhaps as a result, there are still only a handful of well-described examples of human-specific regulatory adaptations in primates (<a href=\"#bib64\">Prabhakar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">McLean et al., 2011</a>) and even fewer cases where the underlying regulatory mechanisms have been resolved (<a href=\"#bib70\">Rockman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Pollard et al., 2006</a>).

These cell lines have been shown to display in vitro properties corresponding to relevant patient phenotypes observed in vivo, both as iPSCs and when differentiated into other pertinent cell types, supporting their utility in clinical applications; more generally, these properties also highlight the tantalizing flexibility of iPSCs as a means of exploring developmental and cell lineage determination pathways."

All chimpanzee lines have PluriTest pluripotency scores greater than the pluripotency threshold value of 20 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). We also calculated PluriTest novelty scores for all samples. In human PSCs, novelty values above 1.67 are suggestive of chromosomal duplications or expression of differentiation-associated genes. Human PSCs with high novelty scores are typically either difficult to maintain and expand in culture (because they differentiate spontaneously at a high rate), or cannot be consistently differentiated to all three germ layers. All of our chimpanzee lines had novelty scores above the 1.67 threshold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). However, in contrast to human PSCs with high novelty scores, our chimpanzee lines can be both easily maintained in culture and differentiated into all three germ layer lineages, as demonstrated by the embryoid body and teratoma assays detailed above. We thus hypothesize that the observed high novelty scores are likely driven by inter-species gene regulatory differences that the PluriTest assay, which was trained exclusively on human samples, interpreted as abnormal gene expression."

While all of the chimpanzee iPSCs were derived from fibroblast cell lines (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), the human iPSCs were derived from both fibroblasts and immortalised LCLs from Caucasian and Yoruba individuals (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> for additional details).

We compared the chimpanzee data to histone modification data from three human iPSC lines from the Roadmap Epigenomics project (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). To do so, we downloaded raw sequence files from GEO and processed data from both species using the same pipeline (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We identified ChIP-seq peaks using MACS or RSEG, as appropriate, and accounted for differences in genome sequence between the species as well as for incomplete power to identify peaks across species (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). To relate the ChIP-seq data to genes (and integrate over data from all peaks that are in proximity to a given gene), we then generated enrichment ChIP scores for a set of previously defined 26,115 orthologous transcription start sites (TSSs, from <a href=\"#bib90\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>). The enrichment score (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details, also <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 8</a>), reflects the ratio of mapped ChIP-seq read counts across all peaks within a 4 kb window centred on an orthologous TSS, relative to the genome-wide read count average after adjusting expectations based on the input control sample. We chose to classify as \u2018enriched\u2019 any region where the mean enrichment score across all three individuals in the species was larger than 1. This cut-off is arbitrary, but we confirmed that our qualitative results are robust by additionally testing enrichment cut-offs of 2, 5, and 10."

We thus focused on a set of 3913 genes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Li et al., 2013</a>) previously annotated as bivalently modified in human PSCs\u2014that is, genes known to be associated with both high H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, indicative of a \u2018poised\u2019 or \u2018primed\u2019 state (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>). We expect the vast majority of these genes to also be associated with similar modifications in chimpanzee iPSCs. Only 2910 of the known bivalent genes were associated with clear orthologous TSSs and could be tested using our comparative H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data. Of these, 306 were not associated with the modification in either species, whereas of the 2604 genes that were associated with H3K27me3 in at least one species, 2368 (90.1%) were enriched for H3K27me3 in both species (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> p &lt; 10<sup>\u221216</sup>)."

Due to our stringent requirements for establishing orthology, we were initially able to examine data from 14 of those genes; 11 of which were associated with H3K27ac in both species (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)\u2014one of the discrepancies is <i>REX1</i> (also known as <i>ZFP42</i>), which we discuss further below. We extended our analysis to include the full set of 22 pluripotency transcription factors regardless of orthology, by testing solely for absence or presence of signal peaks identified by MACS (i.e., without considering enrichment scores; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We again found a high overlap in H3K27ac enrichment across species, with 15 of the 22 genes associated with H3K27ac enrichment in both species (including the three master regulators of pluripotency, <i>OCT4</i>, <i>SOX2</i>, and <i>NANOG;</i> <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Of the remaining 7 genes, one (<i>DAX1</i>) was not found to be associated with H3K27ac in either species, four genes (<i>ESSRB, KLF2, KLF4,</i> and <i>KLF5</i>) were associated with H3K27ac only in chimpanzee (although this observation may reflect incomplete power to detect peaks in the human data), and only two genes (<i>ZFX</i> and <i>REX1</i>) were associated with H3K27ac in human but not in chimpanzee iPSCs."

Expression values in all iPSC lines are shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> (see also <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Given the stringency of our interspecies analysis approach with respect to unique read mapping, we are unable to calculate RNA-seq-based expression estimates for six of these TFs, including <i>OCT4</i> or <i>NANOG</i>, both of which have multiple pseudogenes that can confound mapping algorithms (however, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, our qPCR results demonstrate that expression of those 2 genes is similar amongst all chimpanzee iPSC lines, and marginally higher than in our human iPSC control line). Of the 16 TFs with expression data for iPSCs from both species, 4 (<i>E2F1, ESRRB, SALL4</i> and <i>REX1</i>) are DE between human and chimpanzee iPSCs at an FDR of 1%. Of these, <i>ESRRB</i> and <i>REX1</i> are associated with absolute inter-species expression log<sub>2</sub> fold-changes &gt;1. However, because <i>ESRRB</i> is expressed at very low levels across all samples (mean RPKM across all 14 samples = 0.47), we focused our subsequent analyses on <i>REX1</i>, which is expressed at low or undetectable levels in 6 of our 7 chimpanzee iPSCs (mean RPKM = 0.667), but at high levels in all human iPSC lines (mean RPKM = 180.58) and a single chimpanzee iPSC, C6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Our DNA methylation data is consistent with this gene expression pattern: all 10 probes located in the 5\u2032 UTR or up to 1500 bp upstream from the <i>REX1</i> TSS are highly methylated in the six chimpanzee lines (mean \u03b2 across all promoter probes = 0.87), but exhibit intermediate or low levels of DNA methylation in all of the human iPSC lines and the <i>REX1</i>-expressing C6 line (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>); the entire region is a DMR (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 5</a>). Consistent with these findings, <i>REX1</i> is also differentially enriched for H3K27ac signal in the two species\u2014we identified no H3K27ac peaks at the <i>REX1</i> TSS in the three chimpanzee lines, which did not include C6 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

We asked whether there is an excess of DE genes among those thought to be directly regulated by, or downstream of, <i>REX1</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), but failed to find enrichment in all categories except for genes associated with GO term BP:0006096, glycolysis, where 19 of 34 testable genes were DE at an FDR of 1% between the two species (p &lt; 0.01 from 100,000 permutations). The direction of this effect ran contrary to previous reports, however, with genes highlighted by <a href=\"#bib75\">Son et al. (2013)</a> as downregulated following <i>REX1</i> knockdown, such as <i>PGAM1</i> or <i>LDHA</i>, having significantly higher expression in chimpanzee iPSCs than in human iPSCS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Furthermore, the <i>REX1</i>-expressing line C6 is not an outlier amongst the other chimpanzee iPSC lines (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), suggesting that the observed inter-species regulatory differences cannot be attributed to differences in <i>REX1</i> expression between the species."

Furthermore, and consistent with our observations, <i>REX1</i> is either absent or expressed at low levels in one replicate of either of the two retrovirally reprogrammed bonobo (<i>Pan paniscus</i>, sister species to chimpanzees) iPSC lines generated by <a href=\"#bib49\">Marchetto et al. (2013b)</a>, although it is expressed in both replicates of both chimpanzee iPCS lines from the same group (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Together, these findings suggest that that the variable loss of <i>REX1</i> expression in chimpanzee and bonobo iPSCs does not impair pluripotency, and that its regulatory functions of in humans may be being fulfilled in chimpanzee iPSCs by other regulatory mechanisms."

Following joint normalisation and modelling of data from all samples (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we classified 5663 genes as DE between the chimpanzee precursor fibroblasts and the collection of human precursor LCLs and fibroblasts, as well as 84,747 DM probes and 9107 DMRs (always at an FDR of 1%). Most of these regulatory differences, however, reflect variation across cell types rather than across species (6324 genes and 70,312 probes are DE or DM between the human fibroblasts and LCLs, respectively). We thus considered only data from the fibroblast precursors in the two species. Only 2 of the human iPSCs were reprogrammed from fibroblasts, leading to a loss in power; we were nonetheless able to identify 1236 DE genes and 25,456 DM probes between human and chimpanzee fibroblasts, and 1118 DE genes and 16,392 DM probes between the corresponding iPSCs of the two species. None of these gene sets were significantly enriched for functional annotations using GO BP terms. Although the overlap of inter-species DE genes and DM probes between the iPSCs and the precursors is considerable (13.6% of DE genes and 11.8% of DM probes), a large number of regulatory differences are only observed between the iPSC lines of the two species (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This observation is robust with respect to different approaches to normalising and modelling the data (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), strongly suggesting that many of the differences we observe between our chimpanzee and human iPSC lines may be intrinsic features of the pluripotent state in these two species."

To this end, we have generated a panel of 7 fully characterized chimpanzee iPSCs. All lines are capable of spontaneously giving rise to the three tissue germ layers in vitro and in vivo and meet all currently established criteria for pluripotency. The chimpanzee iPSC lines provide a tantalising avenue for investigating how changes in gene expression and regulation underlie the architecture of complex phenotypic traits in humans and our closest living relatives (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gallego Romero et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Marchetto et al., 2013a</a>). In particular, we believe that through the use of directed differentiation protocols, functional studies could be performed in cell types where strong a priori hypotheses support a role for selective pressure underlying inter-species divergence (e.g., liver, heart, kidney [<a href=\"#bib8\">Blekhman et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2010</a>]). In that sense, we hope that this panel of cell lines will be a useful tool to researchers interested in overcoming current limitations of comparative studies in primates. To that purpose, all chimpanzee iPSC described in this publication the panel are available fully and without restrictions to other investigators upon request to the corresponding authors."

However, in the course of our work we have found that retroviral vector silencing in chimpanzee iPSCs was not as stable as in human iPSC lines generated at the same time using the same method (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>).

Given the panel size, it is powerful enough to robustly detect inter-species differences in gene expression, splicing and regulation. The fact that our panel contains both female and male lines also allows for future studies of sex-specific differences in gene expression in various cell types.

Additional support for this notion was provided by the strong overlap in H3K27me3 signal between the two species, especially in known bivalent genes.

We believe that the reasons for this difference are likely to primarily stem from increased power to detect DE genes and DMRs in our sample relative to previous work. Given the small amount of intra-species variability we observed in RNA-seq and methylation relative to other tissues, we expect to have greater power to detect small, statistically significantly inter-species differences that would have been missed by studies that consider more variable tissue samples. This notion is supported by the fact that the fraction of genes with log FC &lt; 2 we detect as DE between human and chimpanzee iPSCs is greater than in other comparison we have performed with any other tissue (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Although only one chimpanzee iPSC line expresses <i>REX1</i>, we were unable to identify any systematic differences between our human and chimpanzee iPSCs that would indicate a reduction in pluripotency. We also examined <i>REX1</i> expression levels in 73 human iPSC lines generated in-house from Caucasian individuals using the Illumina HT12v4 array (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). All lines had PluriTest pluripotency scores &gt;20, yet 3 of 73 lines (4.1%) showed levels of <i>REX1</i> expression that were indistinguishable from background signal, suggesting that <i>REX1</i> may not be expressed in these individuals despite their high pluripotency scores. We also examined methylation status at the <i>REX1</i> locus in previously published human ESCs and iPSCs from <a href=\"#bib91\">Ziller et al. (2011)</a>, and found that although all ESC lines examined exhibited consistent levels of low methylation at the <i>REX1</i> promoter, human iPSC lines analysed in exhibited either hemi- or hyper-methylated <i>REX1</i> promoter regions (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). In the absence of publicly available <i>REX1</i> expression data from either of the hiPSC lines with hypermethylated promoters we cannot be certain that the gene is not expressed in these lines, but the combination of these findings with our observations above and previous literature suggest that <i>REX1</i> may be important in regulation and maintenance of pluripotency in ESCs, but not necessarily so in iPSCS."

Although it is currently unclear whether some or all of these changes are also present in the bonobo, these findings might explain why we observed low or no <i>REX1</i> expression more frequently in chimpanzees than in humans, and suggests that the gene may not be necessary for maintaining pluripotency in the <i>Pan</i> lineage."

Due to the relatively poor annotation of the chimpanzee genome and to prevent biases in expression level estimates due to differences in mRNA transcript size and genetic divergence between the two species, we limited the analysis to reads that mapped to a list of orthologous metaexons across 30,030 Ensembl genes drawn from hg19 and panTro3, as in <a href=\"#bib7\">Blekhman et al.

X-chromosome methylation patterns in females corroborate these observations, with the majority of probes mapping to the X-chromosome in our data being either hemimethylated (0.2 &lt; \u03b2 &lt; 0.8) or hypermethylated (\u03b2 \u2265 0.8) in females but not in males (<a href=\"#fig7s7\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). We also used a list of 168 imprinted probes from <a href=\"#bib47\">Ma et al. (2014)</a> to check for maintenance of genomic imprinting after reprogramming. We find that the majority of imprinted loci remain hemimethylated following reprogramming in both human and chimpanzee iPSC lines (<a href=\"#fig7s8\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 8</a>). However, we identify two sets of probes that are consistently hypermethylated in pluripotent lines but were hemimethylated in their precursor cells. The first cluster contains 5 probes that are hypermethylated across both chimpanzee and human iPSCs; these probes are associated with the genes <i>KCNK9</i>, <i>ANKRD11</i> and <i>MKRN3</i>. The second cluster is comprised of 21 probes that are hypermethylated in all human iPSCs but only 2 chimpanzee iPSCs in our data, and is associated with the gene <i>PEG3-ZIM2,</i> which has been previously shown to be abnormally methylated in both hESCs and hiPSCs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lund et al., 2012</a>)."
