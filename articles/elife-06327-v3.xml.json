Here, we identify direct palmitoylation of the actin regulator LIM kinase-1 (LIMK1) as a novel mechanism to control spine-specific actin dynamics. A conserved palmitoyl-motif is necessary and sufficient to target LIMK1 to spines and to anchor LIMK1 in spines. ShRNA knockdown/rescue experiments reveal that LIMK1 palmitoylation is essential for normal spine actin polymerization, for spine-specific structural plasticity and for long-term spine stability. Palmitoylation is critical for LIMK1 function because this modification not only controls LIMK1 targeting, but is also essential for LIMK1 activation by its membrane-localized upstream activator PAK. These novel roles for palmitoylation in the spatial control of actin dynamics and kinase signaling provide new insights into structural plasticity mechanisms and strengthen links between dendritic spine impairments and neuropathological conditions."

Here, we identify direct palmitoylation of the actin regulator LIM kinase-1 (LIMK1) as a novel mechanism to control spine-specific actin dynamics. A conserved palmitoyl-motif is necessary and sufficient to target LIMK1 to spines and to anchor LIMK1 in spines. ShRNA knockdown/rescue experiments reveal that LIMK1 palmitoylation is essential for normal spine actin polymerization, for spine-specific structural plasticity and for long-term spine stability. Palmitoylation is critical for LIMK1 function because this modification not only controls LIMK1 targeting, but is also essential for LIMK1 activation by its membrane-localized upstream activator PAK. These novel roles for palmitoylation in the spatial control of actin dynamics and kinase signaling provide new insights into structural plasticity mechanisms and strengthen links between dendritic spine impairments and neuropathological conditions."

For the neurons that receive these signals, these junctions are found on fine branch-like structures called dendrites that stick out of the cell. Dendrites themselves are decorated with smaller structures called dendritic spines, which typically receive information from one other neuron via a single synapse. Dendritic spines form in response to the signaling activity of the neuron, and problems with forming these spines have been linked to conditions such as autism and schizophrenia."

One cytoskeleton protein called actin exists as thin filaments that can be extended or broken up by other proteins. It is not fully understood how actin is regulated in the dendritic spines. However, some researchers thought that the proteins that control the formation of the actin filaments would need to be localized to the dendritic spines to ensure that the spines form correctly."

Previous research has suggested that this \u2018palmitoylation\u2019 process is particularly important in neurons. Through a combination of experimental techniques, George et al. now show that palmitoylation is required to localize a protein called LIMK1, which regulates the construction of actin filaments, to the tips of dendritic spines. Further experiments showed that blocking the palmitoylation of LIMK1 alters how actin filaments form, makes spines unstable and causes synapses to be lost."

This \u2018dual-control\u2019 mechanism makes it possible to precisely control where actin filaments form within dendritic spines. In addition to LIMK1, several other enzymes are also modified by palmitoylation. It will therefore be interesting to determine whether this dual control mechanism is broadly used by neurons to precisely regulate the structure and function of individual spines and synapses."

In response to local synaptic cues, neurons can rapidly alter the morphology of individual spines (<a href=\"#bib42\">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Okamoto et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Honkura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Murakoshi et al., 2011</a>). This process likely requires precise spatial regulation of proteins that increase actin polymerization and those that sever/disassemble actin filaments in a given spine. However, many actin regulators are predicted to be soluble, diffusible proteins, which appear poorly suited to operate with the necessary spatial specificity. This raises the question of how spatially precise, spine-specific actin regulation is achieved."

Palmitoylation occurs in all eukaryotic cells but appears to be especially important in neurons because human genetic mutations and mouse knockouts of Palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs, which catalyze palmitoylation) frequently lead to neurological and/or cognitive deficits (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fukata and Fukata, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Greaves and Chamberlain, 2011</a>).

Interestingly, despite similar LIMK1 protein expression across these developmental stages, palmitoyl-LIMK1 was not detected in ABE fractions from DIV4 neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). However, palmitoyl-LIMK1 became detectable at DIV8, increased markedly at DIV12 and remained prominent at DIV20 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

In support of this hypothesis, wt-LIMK1 was highly enriched in spines but CCSS-LIMK1 was not (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). We reasoned that palmitoylation might anchor LIMK1 in spines to limit its diffusion, thus enhancing spatial control of actin regulation. We therefore transfected neurons with GFP-tagged LIMK1 and monitored its diffusibility by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) using time-lapse imaging. Prominent FRAP, indicative of diffusion of the tagged protein, was observed with CCSS-LIMK1-GFP but not with wt-LIMK1-GFP (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Quantitative analysis of FRAP data confirmed that CCSS mutation decreased the stable fraction of LIMK1-GFP in spines (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We note that the time course of LIMK1-GFP FRAP, irrespective of its palmitoylation status, is markedly slower than previously characterized soluble proteins (<a href=\"#bib62\">Star et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bingol et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zheng et al., 2010</a>).

However, we hypothesized that LIMK2's lacks of a CC palmitoyl-motif (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) might render LIMK2 unable to localize to spines and thus unable to compensate for loss of LIMK1. Consistent with this notion, LIMK1 was detected in rat brain Post-Synaptic Density (PSD) fractions, including the PSDIII fraction, which is enriched in spine-associated proteins. In contrast, LIMK2 was absent from PSD fractions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and was not enriched in spines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Biochemical and immunocytochemical assays thus suggest that LIMK1 is targeted to spines but LIMK2 is not. Strikingly, however, a chimeric protein consisting of LIMK1's minimal spine targeting sequence fused to LIMK2 was readily detected in spines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). This result suggests that LIMK1's palmitoyl-motif accounts for differential localization of the two LIMKs, potentially explaining why loss of LIMK1 causes spine-specific phenotypes."

Actin filaments in spines normally turn over rapidly, due to treadmilling, while actin monomers exchange bidirectionally between spines and the adjacent dendritic shaft ([<a href=\"#bib62\">Star et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bosch and Hayashi, 2012</a>]; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). If GFP-actin in a spine is photobleached, new fluorescent GFP-actin monomers normally diffuse into the spine and are incorporated into the barbed end of bleached filaments, predominantly in the juxtamembrane (\u2018shell\u2019) region of the spine head (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hotulainen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Frost et al., 2010</a>). Concomitantly, bleached actin molecules are severed from filament pointed ends (closer to the spine \u2018core\u2019) and exchange out of the spine, which recovers its fluorescence. However, if turnover is impaired, bleached GFP-actin remains trapped within filaments and FRAP is attenuated. The fraction of actin filaments in the spine that are undergoing rapid turnover can thus be determined from the extent of FRAP (<a href=\"#bib62\">Star et al., 2002</a>)."

LIMK1 \u2018knockdown\u2019 neurons expressing GFP-actin, mCherry and LIMK1 shRNA had no change in spine number or morphology in the short term (24 hr post transfection; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This attenuated recovery was evident in plots of the averaged data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), or plots of all individual FRAP measurements (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and is consistent with an increase in the percentage of stable GFP-actin. Two analytical methods confirmed that the fraction of stable actin is indeed significantly increased in LIMK1 knockdown spines (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), see also [<a href=\"#bib35\">Koskinen et al., 2014</a>]).

Taken together, these data suggest that the predominant effect of loss of palmitoyl-LIMK1 on GFP-actin turnover is to reduce the pool of mobile actin in spines. This deficit is initially surprising, because LIMK1 is best known as a negative regulator of cofilin, and increased cofilin activity in the absence of palmitoyl-LIMK1 might be expected to <i>increase</i> actin turnover. We consider possible molecular explanations for this finding in the \u2018Discussion\u2019, but taken together, these results suggest that palmitoyl-LIMK1 is essential for normal actin turnover in spines."

However, despite links between LIMK1 and activity-dependent spine signaling (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bosch et al., 2014</a>), the pathway that activates LIMK1 in spines is unclear. LIMK1 can be phosphorylated by either PAK or ROCK family kinases (<a href=\"#bib19\">Edwards et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Maekawa et al., 1999</a>), both of which are active at the membrane because they bind active forms of Rac/Rho/Cdc42 small G proteins. Interestingly, PAK inhibition, but not ROCK inhibition, greatly reduced LIMK1 phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>), suggesting that PAK is the key LIMK1 activator in spines. This conclusion is supported by the robust phosphorylation of LIMK1 by PAK3 in vitro (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), and by prior links between PAKs and activity-dependent morphological plasticity of single spines (<a href=\"#bib46\">Murakoshi et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, consistent with findings that spine morphological plasticity requires CaMKII (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lee et al., 2009</a>), a CaMKII inhibitor also greatly reduced LIMK1 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>).

This study reveals a novel role for palmitoylation in the spatial control of signaling events that regulate neuronal actin polymerization. It has been unclear how actin regulatory proteins, many of which are predicted to be diffusible, can control spatially precise changes in dendritic spine morphology. Our results suggest that one key factor in the spatial control of actin dynamics is palmitoylation of the actin regulator LIMK1, which is required for normal actin turnover in spines, for spine-specific structural plasticity and for long-term spine stability. These findings reveal new mechanisms that may govern both spine-specific morphological plasticity and perhaps also intra-spine control of actin dynamics."

First, palmitoylation is critical for LIMK1 enrichment in dendritic spines (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Interestingly, even LIMK1 mutants that are predicted to be dually lipidated (Myr-SC- and Myr-CS-LIMK1) are not spine-enriched, suggesting that dual palmitoylation is the key factor that controls LIMK1 spine targeting. Consistent with this notion, LIMK1's dual palmitoylation motif is sufficient to target a heterologous protein (GFP) to spines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). It is remarkable that such specific targeting information is contained within such a short sequence. Moreover, to our knowledge, no other specific spine-targeting motif has been described. LIMK1's 1\u201315 sequence could hence be extremely useful to deliver any protein of interest specifically to spines, which could facilitate a range of studies into spine and synaptic biology."

These results suggest that enrichment on the spine membrane, rather than membrane attachment per se, is essential for LIMK1 phosphorylation in neurons.

Surprisingly, though, a significant percentage of actin in LIMK1 knockdown (and CCSS-LIMK1 \u2018rescue\u2019) spines appears to be very stable. One possible explanation for this finding is that LIMK1 knockdown may increase the formation of cofilin-actin rods (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bamburg et al., 2010</a>), stable structures that are formed only by dephospho-cofilin (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>).

It has been hypothesized that in order for treadmilling to occur normally, LIMK1 may need to phosphorylate and inhibit cofilin specifically in juxtamembrane regions (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ridley, 2006</a>). How such spatially precise cofilin regulation might be achieved has been unclear, but could be aided by the enrichment of active, palmitoylated LIMK1 on the spine membrane. Juxtamembrane-specific phosphorylation of cofilin by palmitoyl-LIMK1 would be predicted to locally favor actin filament polymerization to maintain or, in response to local synaptic cues, rapidly expand the size of the spine head. Conversely, palmitoyl-LIMK1's absence from the spine core would allow cofilin to remain active and disassemble/sever actin filaments, ensuring a supply of actin monomers for treadmilling and limiting excess filament polymerization.

Changes in neuronal activity acutely alter palmitoylation of a subset of synaptodendritic proteins (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kang et al., 2008</a>). However, our preliminary findings suggest that LIMK1 does not fall into this category, because LIMK1 palmitoylation in ABE assays is unaltered by treatment of neurons with Bicuculline or KCl (JG and GT, unpublished observations). However, it is still possible that extracellular stimuli, particularly those such as ephrins that acutely regulate spine dynamics via PAK (<a href=\"#bib53\">Penzes et al., 2003</a>), may dynamically alter LIMK1 palmitoylation. In addition, limitations of the ABE assay (which detects the entire cellular complement of palmitoyl-LIMK1, irrespective of location) could mask selective changes in LIMK1 palmitoylation at spines."

This finding suggests that no single PAT is likely to control LIMK1 palmitoylation. It is also unclear whether the activity of LIMK1's upstream activators PAK and/or CaMKII is required for LIMK1 palmitoylation. These are all interesting questions to address in the future."

This latter phenotype was linked to impaired spine morphology, but whether LIMK1 acts directly in spines was unclear. Our results strongly support this hypothesis and further implicate LIMK1 palmitoylation as critical for the control of spine structure.

The more subtle effects of conventional <i>LIMK1</i> knockout may be due to developmental compensation by other pathways. Indeed, acute knockdown of other synaptic proteins causes more dramatic effects than germline knockout (<a href=\"#bib20\">Elias et al., 2006</a>).

From the data presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, it seems that that the actual rates of fluorescence recovery are quite similar in all cases (although this should be carefully examined by fitting the data). However, LIMK1 knockdown and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue cells exhibit a significantly larger immobile fraction of actin compared to control cells. Thus, while majority of actin filaments in control cells undergo relatively rapid turnover, approximately 30 % of actin filaments in LIMK1 (and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue spines) appear to be very stable. How does inactivation of LIMK1, which is a negative regulator of ADF/cofilin-mediated rapid actin filament disassembly, result in appearance of a stable actin filament pool in spines (because increased ADF/cofilin activity would be expected to increase (not decrease) actin filament turnover in spines)? This surprising result should be discussed in the 'Results' and 'Discussion' sections in more detail. Furthermore, the FRAP data should be properly fitted and analyzed as described e.g. in Koskinen et al., (Mol. Cell. Neurosci., 2014) to obtain information about the dynamics of the mobile actin fraction."

This motif is both necessary and sufficient to target and anchor LIMK1 within dendritic spines. Interestingly, the authors find a brefeldin A-dependent and independent mechanism for spine delivery of palmitoylated-LIMK1, the former being used to supply proximal spines within about 100 \u03bcm of the soma and the latter used to deliver palmitoylated LIMK1 to distal spines. The activation of LIMK1 in spines by Pak is shown to be dependent upon LIMK1 palmitoylation, although in vitro, soluble active Pak can phosphorylate wild type and the non-palmitoylatable mutant CCSS-LIMK1 equally well. Studies on actin assembly dynamics using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in spines of neurons expressing WT and mutant forms of LIMK1 show that normal dynamics and spine enlargement driven by glutamate stimulation requires palmitoylated LIMK1."

Unless the N-terminal myristoylation interfered with recognition of the palmitoylation domain by the PAT, this experiment should be easily done. If the Myr/Palm form is bound to membrane in spines, is it activated normally by signaling through Pak?"

Severing can occur anywhere in the filament where ADP-actin subunits predominate (which is generally more toward the pointed end of dynamic filaments). However, the type of turnover of these branched networks that is occurring is more correctly termed array treadmilling and there are many more current reviews, one of which should be cited for this. Given that the authors favor a cofilin gradient model, it is surprising that the Discussion fails to include a reference to work published from the Zheng lab in Nature Neuroscience (Gu J, et al., Nat Neurosci 13, 1208-1215, 2010) in which cofilin inhibition by LIMK1 was required for LTP-induced spine enlargement, a role proposed here for the LIMK1 in spines."

There are many additional factors that need to be considered. First, for cofilin to be regulated in such a manner its concentration would have to be quite low in spines and one would expect the phosphatases, which regulate its activation, would also need to be localized to the central domain because their activity seems to dominate the phosphorylation state of cofilin (see Gu paper referenced above and others). There is evidence that slingshot-1L, a major cofilin phosphatase is only active when bound to F-actin, a fact that could help support the gradient model (Nagata-Ohashi K, et al. J Cell Biol. 165: 465-471, 2004: Soosairajah J, et al., EMBO J 24, 473-486, 2005). However, other studies suggest that the actin filament severing activity of cofilin is modulated (enhanced) in vivo by Aip1 (see recent Chen et al., J Biol Chem, 290: 2289-2300, 2015 and references theirin) and that cofilin's recruitment to F-actin is also modulated by coronin 1A (Kueh HY et al., J Cell Biol. 182:341-353, 2008). These proteins likely impact the actin dynamics and retrograde flow. Finally, many (perhaps all?) spines may undergo transient penetration by microtubules (Merriam EB, et al., J Neurosci 33: 16471-82, 2013)), whose assembly may also be modulated in a LIMK1-dependent manner by p25/TPPP, a protein that affects HDAC activity and acetylation of MTs (Acevedo K, et al., Exp Cell Res, 313, 4091-4106, 2007; Schofield AV, et al., J Biol Chem 288: 7907-17, 2013). I am not trying to argue for any one of these models, but simply believe that in this paper the authors have not convinced me that a gradient of cofilin activity exists nor that cofilin is the only target involved in regulating the actin dynamics. Maybe tone this model down a bit and remove the figure since such a figure is often what the reader will take away, even if totally speculative."

Interestingly, neither mutant recapitulated the spine enrichment of wild type LIMK1, and neither mutant was as efficiently phosphorylated at T508.

Taken together, these results suggest that myristate + palmitate modification is not equivalent to dipalmitoylation, and that an intact CC di-palmitoylation motif is essential to target LIMK1 to spines. Based on our accompanying pharmacological data (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), the spine enrichment of key \u2018upstream\u2019 kinases (activated forms of PAK and CaMKII) likely explains why LIMK1 mutants in other locations are not activated.

Filaments are more likely to sever at boundaries between cofilin-bound (twisted) and unbound (untwisted) regions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bobkov et al., 2006</a>, J. Mol. Biol.). However, an entire cofilin-bound filament, as might occur in the absence of LIMK1, is more stable than a bare filament (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dedova et al., 2004</a>, Biophys Chem; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</a>, Mol.

Strikingly, as noted in our initial manuscript, the LTP-like stimuli used in our uncaging experiments result in shrinkage of a significant subset of spines (an <span class=\"underline\">LTD</span>-like effect) in the LIMK1 knockdown and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue conditions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that \u2018learning rules\u2019 are impaired in some LIMK1 knockdown (and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue) spines, so that they respond to LTP-like inputs with LTD-like outputs. Spontaneous bursts of activity in our cultured neurons may therefore be interpreted as LTD-like stimuli by some LIMK1 knockdown spines. In the short term this would be predicted to decrease actin filament turnover, as reported by Star et al., while over longer times this impaired actin turnover may contribute to the spine shrinkage and synapse loss that we observe. We note in our revised Discussion that the three explanations above are not mutually exclusive and could all contribute to the impaired actin filament turnover in the absence of palmitoyl-LIMK1. Moreover, we also mention the possibility that other potential LIMK1 substrates, in addition to cofilin, may contribute to this effect."

Strikingly, as noted in our initial manuscript, the LT<span class=\"underline\">P</span>-like stimulus used in our uncaging experiments usually triggers spine enlargement, but in a subset of LIMK1 knockdown and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue spines, instead triggers spine shrinkage (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that some LIMK1 knockdown (and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue) spines respond to LTP-like inputs with LTD-like outputs i.e. that their learning rules are impaired. Spontaneous bursts of activity in our cultured neurons may therefore be interpreted as an LTD-like stimulus by some LIMK1 knockdown spines. In the short term this may result in decreased actin filament turnover, as reported by Star et al., while over longer times this impaired actin turnover may contribute to the spine shrinkage and synapse loss seen in the absence of palmitoyl-LIMK1. We note that the three explanations above are not mutually exclusive and could all contribute to the impaired actin filament turnover in the absence of palmitoyl-LIMK1."

There are many additional factors that need to be considered. First, for cofilin to be regulated in such a manner its concentration would have to be quite low in spines and one would expect the phosphatases, which regulate its activation, would also need to be localized to the central domain because their activity seems to dominate the phosphorylation state of cofilin (see Gu paper referenced above and others). There is evidence that slingshot-1L, a major cofilin phosphatase is only active when bound to F-actin, a fact that could help support the gradient model (Nagata-Ohashi K, et al. J Cell Biol. 165: 465-471, 2004: Soosairajah J, et al., EMBO J 24, 473-486, 2005). However, other studies suggest that the actin filament severing activity of cofilin is modulated (enhanced) in vivo by Aip1 (see recent Chen et al., J Biol Chem, 290: 2289-2300, 2015 and references theirin) and that cofilin's recruitment to F-actin is also modulated by coronin 1A (Kueh HY et al., J Cell Biol. 182:341-353, 2008). These proteins likely impact the actin dynamics and retrograde flow. Finally, many (perhaps all?) spines may undergo transient penetration by microtubules (Merriam EB, et al., J Neurosci 33: 16471-82, 2013)), whose assembly may also be modulated in a LIMK1-dependent manner by p25/TPPP, a protein that affects HDAC activity and acetylation of MTs (Acevedo K, et al., Exp Cell Res, 313, 4091-4106, 2007; Schofield AV, et al., J Biol Chem 288: 7907-17, 2013). I am not trying to argue for any one of these models, but simply believe that in this paper the authors have not convinced me that a gradient of cofilin activity exists nor that cofilin is the only target involved in regulating the actin dynamics. Maybe tone this model down a bit and remove the figure since such a figure is often what the reader will take away, even if totally speculative</i>."
