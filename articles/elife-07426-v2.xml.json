It is unclear how the low abundant Ire1\u03b1 efficiently finds and cleaves the majority of mRNAs at the ER membrane. Here, we reveal that Ire1\u03b1 forms a complex with the Sec61 translocon to cleave its mRNA substrates. We show that Ire1\u03b1's key substrate, <i>XBP1u</i> mRNA, is recruited to the Ire1\u03b1-Sec61 translocon complex through its nascent chain, which contains a pseudo-transmembrane domain to utilize the signal recognition particle (SRP)-mediated pathway. Depletion of SRP, the SRP receptor or the Sec61 translocon in cells leads to reduced Ire1\u03b1-mediated splicing of XBP1u mRNA. Furthermore, mutations in Ire1\u03b1 that disrupt the Ire1\u03b1-Sec61 complex causes reduced Ire1\u03b1-mediated cleavage of ER-targeted mRNAs. Thus, our data suggest that the Unfolded Protein Response is coupled with the co-translational protein translocation pathway to maintain protein homeostasis in the ER during stress conditions."

These proteins contain either a signal sequence or transmembrane domain (TMD) that is co-translationally captured by the SRP and targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akopian et al., 2013</a>). At the ER membrane, the Sec61 translocon facilitates insertion or translocation of these polypeptides into the ER membrane (<a href=\"#bib28\">Park and Rapoport, 2012</a>). The ER contains a network of chaperones and enzymes to assist in folding proteins into their native conformations (<a href=\"#bib4\">Braakman and Bulleid, 2011</a>). When the influx of nascent polypeptides exceeds the ER protein folding capacity, misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER and lead to ER stress. Under ER stress, signaling pathways, collectively termed the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), are activated to restore ER homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>). The activation of the UPR leads to various cellular processes that include: transcriptional upregulation of UPR target genes, attenuation of translation, activation of ER associated degradation, and ER expansion. However, if ER homeostasis cannot be restored, the UPR induces cell death pathways to eliminate non-functional cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Walter and Ron, 2011</a>). The significance of the UPR is underscored by the fact that aberrations in UPR signaling can lead to a multitude of diseased states including neurological disorders, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang and Kaufman, 2012</a>). In solid tumors, the UPR is constitutively activated as an adaptive response pathway for survival under adverse conditions, such as hypoxia (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang and Kaufman, 2012</a>)."

The most ancient member of these, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (Ire1), is conserved from yeast to mammals (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cox et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mori et al., 1993</a>). Ire1 contains an ER luminal domain involved in sensing misfolded proteins and cytoplasmic kinase/RNase domains, which are involved in the activation of downstream pathways. Mammals have two Ire1 paralogs, Ire1\u03b1 and Ire1\u03b2. While Ire1\u03b1 is a ubiquitously expressed gene, Ire1\u03b2 expression is restricted to the gastrointestinal tract (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tirasophon et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 1998</a>). Upon ER stress, the Ire1\u03b1 RNase domain is activated by self-oligomerization and subsequently excises a 26 base intron from the cytosolic unspliced form of XBP1u mRNA (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yoshida et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Calfon et al., 2002</a>). The resulting mRNA fragments are ligated in the cytosol by RtcB ligase generating the spliced form of XBP1 mRNA (<a href=\"#bib16\">Jurkin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kosmaczewski et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lu et al., 2014</a>). The Ire1\u03b1 mediated splicing step is critical for mounting the UPR, as only the spliced XBP1 mRNA produces an active transcription factor that induces hundreds of genes responsible for increasing ER abundance to accommodate the demand for protein production (<a href=\"#bib30\">Shaffer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sriburi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Acosta-Alvear et al., 2007</a>). In addition to XBP1 mRNA splicing, Ire1\u03b1 also reduces the load of incoming proteins by cleaving ER-localized mRNAs in a process termed regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Han et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hollien et al., 2009</a>). While considerable attention has been paid to the mechanism of Ire1\u03b1 activation, little is known about how the low abundant Ire1\u03b1 efficiently finds and cleaves its mRNA substrates during ER stress. Recent studies have shown that XBP1u mRNA is recruited to the ER membrane through its nascent chain, but the components involved in the specific recruitment of XBP1u mRNA to the Ire1\u03b1 cleavage site in the ER membrane remain unidentified."

We show that this interaction is specific by identifying key residues in Ire1\u03b1, and that it is stable even during ER stress conditions. Surprisingly, we find that a hydrophobic region in the XBP1u protein mimics a TMD and is co-translationally captured by the signal recognition particle (SRP). The SRP bound XBP1u-ribosome nascent chain (RNC) is then delivered to the Sec61 translocon where its mRNA engages with Ire1\u03b1. Despite its interaction with the Sec61 translocon, the XBP1u nascent chain inefficiently inserts into the ER membrane due to its weak hydrophobic region. Furthermore, siRNA mediated depletion of SRP, the SRP receptor or the Sec61 translocon in human cells impairs the Ire1\u03b1-mediated splicing of XBP1u mRNA. Mutations in Ire1\u03b1 that disrupts its association with the Sec61 translocon lead to reduced Ire1\u03b1-mediated cleavage of ER-targeted mRNAs. Over all, our studies establish an important link between the UPR and the co-translational protein translocation pathway, which ensures efficient cleavage of ER-targeted mRNAs during ER stress conditions."

To this end, we performed immunoaffinity purification from detergent solubilized microsomes derived from HEK 293 cells expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Ire1\u03b1. The affinity-purified material was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and bands not present in the control were subjected to analysis by mass spectrometry. Remarkably, in addition to a known Ire1\u03b1 interacting protein, BiP (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bertolotti et al., 2000</a>), we identified all three subunits of the Sec61 translocon (Sec61\u03b1, Sec61\u03b2, and Sec61\u03b3) and Sec63 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We were intrigued by the interaction between the Sec61 translocon and Ire1\u03b1 since we reasoned that it could facilitate Ire1\u03b1 access to RIDD mRNA substrates (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</a>) that are targeted to the Sec61 translocon via their nascent chains. To determine if this interaction occurs at endogenous levels of Ire1\u03b1 and the Sec61 translocon, we co-immunoprecipitated the endogenous Sec61 translocon from a detergent cell extract of non-transfected HEK 293 cells using Sec61\u03b2 antibodies. We could detect a significant amount of endogenous Ire1\u03b1 precipitating with Sec61\u03b2 and Sec61\u03b1 by immunoblotting (IB) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Furthermore, immunodepletion of the Sec61 translocon nearly quantitatively depleted the endogenous Ire1\u03b1, indicating that almost all Ire1\u03b1 is in a complex with the Sec61 translocon in cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Interestingly, this interaction remained stable even after treatment of cells with the ER stress inducer DTT, which impairs protein folding by preventing disulfide bond formation in the ER lumen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These results implied that Ire1\u03b1 interaction with the Sec61 translocon might be functionally important during the conditions of ER stress. We further verified that the Sec61 translocon selectively associated with Ire1\u03b1, but not with the Ire1\u03b1 paralogue Ire1\u03b2 or with the other ER stress sensors PERK (<a href=\"#bib10\">Harding et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Sood et al., 2000</a>) and ATF6\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Haze et al., 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To determine whether the Ire1\u03b1 interaction with the Sec61 translocon is direct, we treated HA-tagged Ire1\u03b1 expressing cells with a lysine-reactive reversible crosslinker, DSP. After quenching the crosslinker, the complex was denatured in urea and SDS, which dissociates noncovalently bound proteins, and immunoprecipitated (IP) with HA antibodies. The resulting IP was treated with DTT to reverse the crosslinking and analyzed by IB. The \u03b1 subunit of the Sec61 translocon could be crosslinked with Ire1\u03b1, as judged by the increase in Sec61\u03b1 signal with increasing concentration of crosslinker (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), thus supporting a direct interaction between Ire1\u03b1 and the Sec61 translocon. Consistent with the result from Sec61\u03b2 immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), the crosslinked adduct was visible even when cells were treated with DTT before the crosslinker reaction, supporting a model where Ire1\u03b1 associates with the Sec61 translocon even under ER stress conditions.

We therefore performed co-immunoprecipitation with HA antibodies using detergent extracts of cells expressing mutant versions of Ire1\u03b1-HA. While deletion of the luminal domain of Ire1\u03b1 (amino acids 30 to 408) had no effect on the interaction with the Sec61 translocon, deletion of an evolutionarily conserved 10 amino acid region (amino acids 434 to 443) in the luminal portion of Ire1\u03b1 adjacent to its TMD nearly abolished the interaction with the Sec61 translocon (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). Mutagenesis of single residues within this region further revealed that Val<sup>437</sup>, Asp<sup>438</sup>, Met<sup>440</sup>, Leu<sup>441</sup> and Asp<sup>443</sup> are crucial for the interaction since replacing any of these amino acids with alanine significantly reduced the interaction with the translocon (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>).

Although XBP1u mRNA encodes a soluble protein and shuttles between the cytosol and nucleus (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yoshida et al., 2006</a>), recent studies have shown that XBP1u is co-translationally targeted to the ER membrane for efficient splicing of its mRNA by Ire1\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yanagitani et al., 2009</a>). This targeting reaction also depends on a C-terminal hydrophobic region 2 (HR2) as well as a translational pausing sequence located in the extreme C-terminus of XBP1u (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yanagitani et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2011</a>). Combined, HR2 and the pausing sequence are speculated to facilitate direct interaction of RNCs of XBP1u with the ER lipid bilayer (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yanagitani et al., 2009</a>). We reasoned that the interaction between XBP1u and lipids might not selectively direct its mRNA-RNCs to the ER membrane within the cell. We therefore hypothesized that XBP1u-RNCs may directly interact with the Sec61 translocon for its specific recruitment to the ER membrane as well as to engage with Ire1\u03b1. To first determine if the recruitment of XBP1u-RNCs requires any ER membrane factor(s), we reconstituted XBP1u recruitment to the ER membrane in vitro. XBP1u transcripts lacking a stop codon were translated using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing <sup>35</sup>S-labelled methionine and ER-derived rough microsomes (RM). As expected, the truncated XBP1u transcripts produced XBP1u-RNCs that were recruited to RM, as indicated by XBP1u peptides in the pellet fraction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). However, a mild trypsin digestion of RM rendered them inactive for XBP1u recruitment. XBP1u recruitment to the ER membrane was dependent on the presence of HR2 since its deletion (XBP1\u0394HR2) abolished the membrane recruitment, while replacing HR2 with a stronger hydrophobic TMD from the transferrin receptor (XBP1u-TR) restored XBP1u recruitment to RM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We obtained similar results when we analyzed full-length versions of XBP1u, thus arguing against membrane recruitment due to artificial stalling of XBP1u at the ribosome (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, bottom). These results supported our hypothesis that XBP1u-RNCs can  be recruited to the ER membrane via an interaction with an ER membrane factor."

To test this, we affinity-purified RNCs of XBP1u from in vitro translation reactions via an N-terminal FLAG-tag and analyzed for SRP recruitment by IB. Indeed, SRP was enriched in RNCs of XBP1u but not in RNCs of XBP1\u0394HR2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). As expected, XBP1u-TR exhibited slightly increased binding to SRP since it contains a genuine TMD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We next wondered whether the binding of SRP to HR2 of XBP1u-RNCs is essential for targeting to the ER membrane. To address this, we translated XBP1u mRNA in vitro using a wheat germ extract that lacks SRP that is compatible with the mammalian SRP receptor (<a href=\"#bib40\">Walter and Blobel, 1981</a>). When RM stripped of ribosomes/SRP by puromycin and high salt (PK-RM) was added to this reaction, XBP1u nascent peptides were localized in the soluble fraction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In contrast, adding back purified SRP to the original level found in RM shifted XBP1u localization to the pellet fraction, mirroring the membrane recruitment of XBP1u."

Cells depleted of the SRP subunits SRP14 or SRP54 showed sharply reduced XBP1u mRNA splicing upon treatment with the ER stress inducer DTT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Similarly, depletion of the \u03b1 subunit of the SRP receptor (SR\u03b1) nearly abolished splicing of XBP1u mRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Importantly, these effects were not due to a defect in the biosynthesis of Ire1\u03b1 since its level was unchanged by transient depletion of either SRP or its receptor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). To rule out the possibility that the reduction in XBP1u mRNA splicing observed in SRP knockdown experiments was not due to diminished ER substrate burden and Ire1\u03b1 activation, we examined the activation of ER stress sensors under knockdown conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a>). Auto-phosphorylation of PERK and Ire1\u03b1 in response to DTT treatment was identical under both control and SRP54/14 knockdown conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In addition, depletion of SRP14, SR\u03b1 or Sec61\u03b1 had little effect on the amount of PERK phosphorylation and ATF6 cleavage in response to ER stress (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These data suggest that the reduced XBP1u mRNA splicing in the SRP pathway knockdown experiments is not an indirect effect but a result of reduced XBP1u mRNA targeting to the ER membrane. Together these results suggest that SRP binds to HR2 of XBP1u-RNC and recruits it to the ER membrane for Ire1\u03b1 mediated splicing of XBP1u mRNA under ER stress conditions."

To examine this, we isolated the ER membrane-targeted RNCs of XBP1u from in vitro translation reactions and treated them with a cysteine reactive chemical crosslinker. We observed a weak crosslinking between XBP1u and the Sec61\u03b1 subunit (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, lanes 2 and 4). By contrast, XBP1u strongly crosslinked to the \u03b2 subunit of the translocon, presumably via a single cysteine residue localized in its cytosolic domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, lanes 2 and 5). This result implied that the moderate hydrophobicity of HR2 of XBP1u might prevent full engagement of the translocon. This was further supported by the improved crosslinking between XBP1u and Sec61\u03b1 observed when we used XBP1u-TR, which contains a genuine TMD (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, compare 4 and 7). It has been previously shown that the Sec61 translocon can discriminate between functional and non-functional or weak signal sequences (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jungnickel and Rapoport, 1995</a>). Accordingly, the functional signal sequence is able to form a protease resistant tight junction with the Sec61 translocon. To directly test if RNCs of XBP1u form a weak or tight junction with the Sec61 translocon, we performed a proteinase K (PK) accessibility assay with the ER membrane targeted RNCs of XBP1u. We noticed efficient protection of the XBP1u signal sequence HR2 under physiological salt concentration but it became partially PK sensitive under high salt conditions, suggesting that XBP1u HR2 forms a weak junction with the translocon (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> compare band 1 in lane 2 and 3). By contrast, we observed a tight complex between XBP1u-TR and the translocon as judged by an increased protection of XBP1-TR relative to XBP1u under high salt conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> compare band 1 in lane 3 and 8). Interestingly, upon high salt and puromycin treatment, which releases nascent chains from ribosomes, we detected membrane-protected fragments for XBP1-TR that disappeared after treating with a detergent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> lane 9, 10), demonstrating that insertion of XBP1u-TR occurs after its release from the ribosome. However, we failed to detect membrane-protected fragments for XBP1u, suggesting that XBP1u HR2 is rejected by the Sec61 translocon after its release from the ribosome. Interestingly, we noticed ribosome protected fragments even after puromycin treatment, indicating that the interaction between the translational pausing sequence of XBP1u and the ribosome exit tunnel remains stable (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> band 2 in lanes 5 and 10)."

To address this, we introduced an N-glycan acceptor site prior to the stop codon of XBP1u constructs and translated them in the presence of RM. Glycosylation, a post-translocational event diagnostic of successful insertion, was readily detected for XBP1u, as determined by endoglycosidase H (Endo H) deglycosylation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As expected, no glycosylation was detected for XBP1\u0394HR2, whereas XBP1-TR showed increased glycosylation. Importantly, the co-translational protein insertion pathway was solely responsible for these insertion activities since almost no glycosylation was detected during a post-translational protein insertion assay (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, a time course experiment revealed a decreased rate of glycosylation for XBP1u relative to its counterpart XBP1u-TR, suggesting that its weak hydrophobic region HR2 impedes efficient insertion into the membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Corroborating the in vitro results, in cells expressing XBP1u constructs we detected the HR2 dependent glycosylation of XBP1u, which was sensitive to the Endo H or peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase) treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). As expected, the XBP1u glycosylation was significantly less efficient relative to that of XBP1u-TR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These findings are consistent with recent observations that a fraction of XBP1u could be inserted into the ER membrane in cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2014</a>). Collectively, these results suggest that the sequence of XBP1u HR2 has evolved in a way that it manages to follow the co-translational protein translocation pathway, but avoids efficient insertion into the ER membrane."

Our results have established a direct link between the co-translational translocation pathway and the UPR that facilitates efficient cleavage of ER-targeted mRNAs by Ire1\u03b1 during ER stress (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Specifically, we have identified a complex comprising Ire1\u03b1 and the Sec61 translocon, which is stable even during ER stress conditions. We have shown that this interaction is specific and is not captured while Ire1\u03b1 is being synthesized in the Sec61 translocon since the other ER stress sensors, Ire1\u03b2, PERK or ATF6, fail to interact with the Sec61 translocon. Moreover, our domain mapping studies identified a conserved region in the luminal domain of Ire1\u03b1 required for this interaction. Several observations suggest that Ire1\u03b1 may directly interact or at least be in close proximity to the Sec61 translocon. First, our Ire1\u03b1 pull down experiment identified the Sec61 translocon as one of the major interacting proteins in addition to Sec63 and BiP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We can exclude the possibility that Ire1\u03b1 associates with the Sec61 translocon through BiP since the interaction is stable even during ER stress conditions, whereas BiP dissociates from Ire1\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bertolotti et al., 2000</a>). Second, our chemical crosslinking studies captured a crosslinked adduct between Ire1\u03b1 and the \u03b1 subunit of the Sec61 translocon (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). However, interaction studies with purified Ire1\u03b1 and the Sec61 translocon are required to demonstrate if these proteins directly interact with each other. Interestingly, the Sec61 translocon interaction region is conserved only in vertebrates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), which suggests that the Ire1\u03b1 interaction with the Sec61 translocon may not be absolutely essential for cleavage of its mRNA substrates but would increase the fidelity and efficiency of Ire1\u03b1."

                        "text": "We hypothesized that XBP1u mRNA might be targeted and localized in proximity to the Ire1\u03b1-Sec61 translocon complex in order to be efficiently cleaved during ER stress to yield an active transcription factor for UPR target genes. Initial biochemical fractionation studies have shown that XBP1u mRNA is localized in the ER membrane although its encoded protein is soluble and localized both in the cytosol and nucleus (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stephens et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yoshida et al., 2006</a>). Elegant studies from the Kohno group revealed that XBP1u mRNA is co-translationally targeted to the ER membrane as RNCs (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yanagitani et al., 2009</a>). They further showed that this targeting reaction also depends on a hydrophobic region present in the C-terminus of XBP1u as well as a translational pausing sequence (<a href=\"#bib46\">Yanagitani et al., 2011</a>). Based on the observation that the HR2 of XBP1u associates with protein-free liposomes, they concluded that XBP1u RNCs could directly bind with the ER lipid bilayer. Although these studies have established the importance of co-translational targeting of mRNA-XBP1 RNCs to the ER membrane, it was not clear how these nascent chains are specifically recruited to the ER membrane in the presence of other membrane compartments in the cell. In an attempt to address this issue, we reproduced the ER membrane recruitment assay with XBP1u RNCs in vitro. Consistent with the previous findings, XBP1u RNCs were robustly recruited to the ER membrane in an HR2 dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). However, XBP1u RNCs could not be efficiently recruited to ER membranes treated with trypsin, which suggested that an ER membrane factor might be required for binding with XBP1u RNCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The hydrophobic sequence HR2 dependent targeting of XBP1u RNCs to the ER membrane led us to propose that the SRP pathway might be involved in this targeting reaction. Our biochemical reconstitution studies have revealed that SRP can capture HR2 of XBP1u RNCs, which are then associated with the ER membrane by an interaction with the Sec61 translocon (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). It is possible that the weak hydrophobic sequence of HR2 of XBP1u RNCs can be captured in vitro but may not effectively compete for the SRP binding in cells due to the presence of numerous substrates of SRP, which are likely of stronger hydrophobicity than HR2 of XBP1u. However, our results argue against this idea since siRNA-mediated depletion of co-translational protein translocation components showed significantly reduced Ire1\u03b1-mediated cleavage of XBP1u mRNA in cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). We speculate that the weaker signal sequence of HR2 might be strengthened by a translational pausing sequence in XBP1u, thus providing an increased time window for SRP binding. This is supported by the fact that co-translational pausing of XBP1u nascent chains are crucial for targeting to the ER membrane in vitro and in cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Yanagitani et al., 2011</a>)."

Thus most are released into the cytosol and less than 10% are inserted into the ER membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Future studies are required to precisely determine whether XBP1u nascent chains are released at the Sec61 translocon or after insertion into the ER lipid bilayer. Our results suggest that the moderate hydrophobicity of XBP1u HR2 impedes efficient insertion into the ER membrane, since replacing it with a stronger TMD from the transferrin receptor significantly improved insertion into the ER membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). It is puzzling why XBP1u evolved with a combination of a weak C-terminus HR2 and a translational pausing sequence to utilize the SRP pathway rather than a stronger TMD or a signal sequence. In plants, Ire1 catalyzes the cytoplasmic splicing of bZIP60 mRNA to produce an active transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mishiba et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, bZIP60 mRNA is likely targeted to the ER membrane by the SRP pathway since it encodes a typical transmembrane protein. Therefore, the specific advantage of this unique targeting mechanism utilized by XBP1u mRNA in vertebrates is unclear. It may be that the presence of a soluble form of XBP1u is necessary for a fully switchable UPR. This hypothesis is supported by earlier studies showing that the XBP1u protein binds to the active transcription factor XBP1s and routes it for proteasomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yoshida et al., 2006</a>). This feed back loop has been shown to be important for accurately turning off UPR genes by XBP1s when the ER stress is restored. Recent studies have shown that numerous cytosolic mRNAs are localized in the ER membrane through poorly understood mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib29\">Reid and Nicchitta, 2015</a>). Our findings of the promiscuous substrate selectivity exhibited by SRP in binding moderate hydrophobic region in XBP1u suggests that other cytosolic proteins encoding mRNAs could be targeted to the ER membrane through the SRP pathway."

Indeed, our complementation experiments show that the Sec61 interaction defective Ire1\u03b1 mutants were not able to efficiently mediate splicing of XBP1u mRNA during ER stress as well as cleavage of the RIDD mRNA substrates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). However, we found that overexpressing Ire1\u03b1 mutants restores the inefficient cleavage of mRNAs (data not shown), suggesting that the Sec61 translocon interaction is important to bridge the low abundant Ire1\u03b1 and its mRNA substrates. It is currently unclear how Ire1\u03b1 is localized to the specific translocon where XBP1u mRNA may be found, though it is feasible that Ire1\u03b1 may dynamically monitor the Sec61 translocon population and thus increase the likelihood of contact with translocon-localized XBP1u mRNA. Another intriguing hypothesis is that Ire1\u03b1 may interact with a subset of the translocon population where XBP1u mRNA could be preferentially localized. In any case, it is likely that another layer of complexity may exist in order to facilitate efficient co-localization of Ire1\u03b1 and XBP1u mRNA. In addition, since Ire1\u03b1 interacts with the Sec61 translocon, both under normal and ER stress conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>), it is unclear what prevents Ire1\u03b1 from spuriously cleaving mRNAs associated with the Sec61 translocon under normal conditions. Most likely, accumulation of misfolded proteins triggers self-oligmerization and activation of the translocon-associated Ire1\u03b1 only during ER stress conditions. How Ire1\u03b1 is specifically arranged with the Sec61 translocon to access its substrate mRNAs and how it is coordinated with several other translocon-associated proteins remain important questions for future studies."

At 24 hr after transfection, cells were replated for the second round of transfection with siRNA oligos at 48 hr. 6 hr later cells were transfected with 200 ng of pcDNA5-FLAG-XBP1u-3\u2032 UTR. 96 hr after the first siRNA transfection, cells were harvested using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) for isolation of total proteins and RNA and analysed by IB and RT-PCR of XBP1-mRNA, respectively. shRNA mediated gene silencing in HEK 293 cells was performed by following the previously established protocol (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lakkaraju et al., 2007</a>) except that at fifth day of transfection, cells were replated for transfection with FLAG-XBP1u-3\u2032 UTR and harvested in Trizol after treatment with DTT at sixth day of initial transfection for analysis by both IB and RT-PCR of XBP1u mRNA. To establish stable cell lines, HEK 293-Flp-In T-Rex or MEF <i>Ire1\u03b1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> FRT cells were transfected with 1 \u03bcg of pOG44 vector (Invitrogen) and 0.1 \u03bcg of FRT vectors containing Ire1\u03b1 or its mutants using Lipofectamine 2000. MEF <i>Ire1\u03b1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> FRT cells were plated in hygromycin (50 \u03bcg/ml) 24 hr after transfection, while HEK 293-Flp-In T-Rex cells were plated in hygromycin (100 \u03bcg/ml) plus blasticidin (10 \u03bcg/ml). The medium was replaced every 3 days until colonies appeared. To regulate the expression of Ire1\u03b1 or its mutants in complemented MEF <i>Ire1\u03b1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells, we transfected with pCDNA/tetR (Invitrogen, a kind gift from Dr Dhasakumar Navaratnam) and selected with blasticidin (10 \u03bcg/ml) until colonies appeared. The colonies were picked and the expression of recombinant Ire1\u03b1 or its mutants was compared with control MEF cells."

A hydrophobic segment in the XBP1-u nascent chain is responsible for targeting of XBP1u RNCs to the Sec61 complex. Depletion of subunits of the SRP, the SR or Sec61 reduces processing of XBP1u in cells that are treated with stress inducing agents. Plumb et al. have identified a short sequence in vertebrate Ire1\u03b1 that is necessary for the Sec61-Ire1 interaction. While this manuscript builds on previous research indicating that XBP1u mRNA is translated in the vicinity of the RER, Plum et al. have outlined a reasonable mechanism to explain how a membrane bound endonuclease has access to a mRNA encoding a soluble protein.

This data has now replaced the previous <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> data. This data demonstrates that the activation of either Ire1\u03b1 or PERK is not affected by depletion of SRP54 or SRP14. Indeed, while knockdown of co-translational translocation pathway components might be expected to decrease the ER protein folding load and thus reduce the ER stress response, this is not what we observed. Although it is unclear why this is the case, it may be that sufficient mRNAs are localized to the ER membrane during knock-down conditions to maintain a level of ER protein synthesis that enables the ER stress response. This idea is supported by the maintenance of Ire1\u03b1 protein levels throughout the experiment, although the growth rate and cell numbers were reduced in SRP54 or SRP14 knock-down cells compared to control cells as indicated by the anti-tubulin western blot (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Alternatively, it may be that the 10 mM DTT used to induce ER stress may not only prevent disulfide bond formation in newly synthesized proteins but may also break the disulfide bonds of existing proteins, thus inducing ER stress independently of the newly synthesized ER protein folding load. Finally, to emphasize the importance of this point, we have included a more in depth discussion of these experiments and their implications within the main body of the text."
