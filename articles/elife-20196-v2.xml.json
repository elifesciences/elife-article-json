Unexpectedly though, Sullivan et al. also found that the core gene expression pattern associated with trisomy 21 was associated with an interferon-stimulated transcriptional response. It is worth noting that four of the six interferon receptors are encoded on chromosome 21, which partially explains why the interferon pathway is activated."

                "text": "Finally, interferon signaling has well-established functions in regulating tumor development. Individuals with Down syndrome experience a unique cancer risk profile: although they have a dramatically increased risk of developing childhood leukemia, they are far less likely to develop solid tumors than individuals with just two copies of chromosome 21 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Hasle et al., 2016</a>). It remains to be seen whether the cell-type specific effects of interferon signal amplification underlie these differences in tumor susceptibility. In any case, insights into the correlation between hyperactive interferon signaling in Down syndrome and cancer development may provide opportunities for treating both Down syndrome-associated malignancies and cancer in the general population."
