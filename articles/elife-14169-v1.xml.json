For example, the green alga, <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, can swim toward light to increase photosynthesis, but it can also swim away from bright light to avoid damage to molecular complexes required for photosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Foster and Smyth, 1980</a>)."

In most algal systems these photoreceptors act as both a light receptor and as an ion channel to trigger downstream signal transduction, similar to the rhodopsins found in bacteria (<a href=\"#bib8\">Nagel et al., 2005</a>). The second requirement for phototaxis is motility. The third requirement is the ability to determine the direction of the incoming light, so that the cell can respond by moving in the appropriate direction."

Now, in eLife, Conrad Mullineaux, Annegret Wilde and co-workers \u2013 including Nils Schuergers as first author \u2013 report that in a genus of bacteria called Synechocystis, the cells themselves act as lenses that can focus light (<a href=\"#bib9\">Schuergers et al., 2016</a>). They use a combination of high-end microscopy and materials science to show that light hitting the convex surface of the cell is focused by the refractive properties of the cell body into a spot on the opposite side of the cell."

In Synechocystis, motility relies on tiny cell-surface projections called pili that grab the substrate and pull the cell forward, before releasing it and starting another round of grabbing and pulling. Schuergers et al. \u2013 who are based in Freiburg, Karlsruhe, London and Porto \u2013 found that the cells move away from the focused spot, toward the external light source. The required asymmetry is established by motor proteins that drive assembly of the pili, which cluster on the side of the cell away from the focused spot. The photoreceptors, on the other hand, are evenly distributed in the cell membrane."

Thus, to provide useful information for directional movement, the photoreceptors must be clustered in one location in the cell, in organelles called eyespots. The position of the eyespot relative to the flagella is fixed by the asymmetric properties of the microtubule cytoskeleton established by the basal bodies (<a href=\"#bib3\">Holmes and Dutcher, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Kamiya and Witman, 1984</a>). Additionally, elaborate light-absorbing structures, often provided by the chloroplast, block light traveling through the cell (<a href=\"#bib5\">Kawai and Kreimer, 2000</a>)."

These data are also a powerful reminder of the influence of light on life. Photoreceptors have evolved to capture photons and signal transduction pathways have evolved to allow cells to harness their energy. More pointedly, this work reminds us that light is directional and can be absorbed, reflected and refracted by interactions with living cells. This is a beautiful demonstration of the intersection of physics and biology, not only at the cellular level, but at the experimental level as well."

Each cell, acting as a lens, focused the light on the rear edge of the cell (white arrows), and moved toward the light. A strong laser light from above (red circle in center), caused cells entering the small laser-illuminated area on the agar to reverse direction. (See figure 4 in <a href=\"#bib9\">Schuergers et al., 2016</a> for full details)."
