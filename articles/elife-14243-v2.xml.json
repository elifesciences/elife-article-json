To understand the contribution of the transcription machinery in the disassembly of the +1 H2A.Z nucleosome, conditional mutants were used to block PIC assembly. A quantitative ChIP-seq approach, which allows detection of global occupancy change, was employed to measure H2A.Z occupancy. Blocking PIC assembly resulted in promoter-specific H2A.Z accumulation, indicating that the PIC is required to evict H2A.Z. By contrast, H2A.Z eviction was unaffected upon depletion of INO80, a remodeler previously reported to displace nucleosomal H2A.Z. Robust PIC-dependent H2A.Z eviction was observed at active and infrequently transcribed genes, indicating that constitutive H2A.Z turnover is a general phenomenon. Finally, sites with strong H2A.Z turnover precisely mark transcript starts, providing a new metric for identifying cryptic and alternative sites of initiation."

To understand the contribution of the transcription machinery in the disassembly of the +1 H2A.Z nucleosome, conditional mutants were used to block PIC assembly. A quantitative ChIP-seq approach, which allows detection of global occupancy change, was employed to measure H2A.Z occupancy. Blocking PIC assembly resulted in promoter-specific H2A.Z accumulation, indicating that the PIC is required to evict H2A.Z. By contrast, H2A.Z eviction was unaffected upon depletion of INO80, a remodeler previously reported to displace nucleosomal H2A.Z. Robust PIC-dependent H2A.Z eviction was observed at active and infrequently transcribed genes, indicating that constitutive H2A.Z turnover is a general phenomenon. Finally, sites with strong H2A.Z turnover precisely mark transcript starts, providing a new metric for identifying cryptic and alternative sites of initiation."

The protein core of a canonical nucleosome, modular in nature, consists of a tetramer of histones H3 and H4 [indicated as (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub>] and two dimers of histones H2A and H2B (indicated as H2A-H2B) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arents et al., 1991</a>). Nucleosomal DNA, 147-bp in length, wraps around the octameric histone core in 1.7 left-handed turns making 3 minor groove contacts with each histone pair and additional contacts near the entry-exit sites with H3 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Luger et al., 1997</a>). Repeating units of nucleosomes are organized along the genomic DNA in a non-random fashion with nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) overlapping key regulatory elements, such as promoters and replication origins (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eaton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Yuan et al., 2005</a>). Nucleosome-repelling DNA sequences and ATP-dependent remodeling activities contribute to NDR formation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kaplan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>).

The nucleosome immediately downstream of the NDR is termed the +1 nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albert et al., 2007</a>). In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the +1 nucleosome covers the transcription start site (TSS) of most genes. Therefore, it is expected that at some point during the transcription process the +1 nucleosome must be disassembled. It is currently unclear at what stage of transcription disassembly of the +1 nucleosome occurs. It remains possible that chromatin remodeling enzymes are required to remove the +1 nucleosome before Pol II can engage the TSS. For other promoters where the +1 nucleosome covers the TATA element and for those with an untraditional nucleosome structure called the 'fragile nucleosome' within the NDR, histone eviction likely precedes and regulates PIC assembly (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kubik et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</a>).

Specifically, chromatin from fixed haploid yeast cells expressing a\u00a02xFLAG-epitope-tagged\u00a0<i>HTZ1\u00a0</i>gene was digested with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to generate mononucleosomes. H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes were separated from the canonical AA nucleosomes by binding to anti-FLAG affinity gel followed by elution using FLAG peptides. Given that H2A.Z is the only H2A variant in budding yeast and the IP efficiency was consistently over 80% (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), the flow-through (FT) of the IP reaction was highly enriched for the homotypic AA nucleosomes (referred to as the H2A nucleosomes hereafter) and the IP fraction was enriched for the heterotypic AZ and homotypic ZZ nucleosomes (referred collectively to as the H2A.Z nucleosomes hereafter) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Luk et al., 2010</a>). The DNA extracted from both the FT and IP fractions, as well as the DNA from the input nucleosomes used for the IP, was mapped by deep sequencing."

Depletion of signal in the normalized FT fraction data relative to the input represents the immuno-depleted H2A.Z associated DNA. The amplitude of the H2A.Z data was adjusted using a curve fitting algorithm such that the sum of the normalized profiles of the H2A.Z fraction and FT fraction surrounding the +1 nucleosome region (N = 4,738) equals, to a first approximation, the input profile (<a href=\"#bib41\">Luk et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). This approach, called quantitative ChIP-seq or qChIP-seq, is similar to ChIP-coupled quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) in that occupancy is reported in relation to the input of each ChIP reaction but is genome-wide. Unlike standard ChIP-seq, which typically involves normalization by equalizing the read counts of ChIP samples and reports ChIP signals in relation to some background or threshold (e.g. mean of genomic ChIP signal) that may vary among samples, the qChIP-seq method allows more quantitative comparison between samples, especially when a global change in H2A.Z occupancy is expected."

Under permissive conditions (no RAP), H2A.Z was most prevalent at the +1 nucleosomal positions (marked by \u2018+\u2019), less at the -1 positions and progressively less towards the 3\u2019 end of genes in agreement with published results (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albert et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A\u00a0and\u00a0B</a>, <i>top,</i> no RAP). This phenomenon is further demonstrated when the H2A.Z and input profiles were compiled at the dyads of 4,738 +1 nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C\u00a0and\u00a0D</a>, <i>top left</i>). The FT fraction is a good representation of nucleosomal H2A levels, at least qualitatively, for two reasons. First, although the FT fraction may contain unstable histone-DNA complexes that are devoid of H2A, e.g. tetrasomes, or non-histone complexes (<a href=\"#bib56\">Reja et al., 2015</a>), these structures are highly depleted in these experiments as the chromatin was subjected to extensive MNase digestion (unless indicated otherwise, below). Second, an earlier study that used an anti-H2A antibody to ChIP the FT fraction followed by high-resolution tiling microarray analysis produced an AA nucleosome profile that is highly similar to the FT profiles of our current experiments (<a href=\"#bib41\">Luk et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C\u00a0and\u00a0D</a>, <i>bottom left</i>). Therefore, the qChIP-seq data are consistent with previous conclusions that nucleosomes enriched for H2A dominate in coding regions and that, while depleted at the +1 positions, a substantial amount of H2A nucleosomes remains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C\u00a0and\u00a0D</a>, <i>bottom left</i>) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Luk et al., 2010</a>).

(<b>B</b>) An overview of the \u2018TAZ\u2019 normalization approach used to rescale the H2A.Z and H2A nucleosomal profiles. The compiled tag counts (midpoints) in relation to the distance from the +1 nucleosomal dyads (n = 4,738) were plotted for H2A (A), H2A.Z (Z) and input (T) nucleosomes, which are in <i>red, green,</i> and <i>black</i>, respectively. To normalize the raw data, the scaling factors, <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>, were applied to the H2A and H2A.Z profiles respectively. The scaling factor <i>m</i> was determined for each IP reaction by dividing the tag count within the no-Z-zones of the input fraction by that of the H2A fraction. The scaling factor <i>n</i> was subsequently determined by a curve-fitting algorithm such that the sum of the resulting profiles (<i>m</i> \u00d7 H2A + <i>n</i> \u00d7 H2A.Z) equals, to a first approximation, the input nucleosomal profile.

Mapped reads were either presented as tag coverage (density covered by paired-end reads) or tag counts (density of mid-points of paired-end reads) along the yeast genome. Bowtie was also used to determine the tag counts within the no-Z-zones in the input and the H2A fractions. The TAZ curve-fitting algorithm is provided in a Python script, which requires four inputs: the scaling factor <i>m</i> and the compiled nucleosome profiles of H2A, H2A.Z and input around the +1 dyads. The algorithm generates the\u00a0scaling factor <i>n</i> for normalization of the H2A.Z profile."

SWR1 continues to convert H2A nucleosomes to the H2A.Z containing forms but with no eviction to restore these nucleosomes back to the AA state in the absence of the PIC. Consistent with this idea, sites with strong H2A.Z dynamics are more enriched for endogenous SWR1 (<a href=\"#fig1s9\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 9A</a>). An alternative explanation for this phenomenon, however, is that TBP depletion does not block H2A.Z eviction but instead leads to recruitment of aberrantly high levels of SWR1 to promoters as the PICs dissociate. This model predicts that SWR1 levels should increase at promoters upon TBP depletion. To distinguish between these two possibilities, ChIP-qPCR was used to monitor the occupancy of the Swr1 subunit in the <i>TBP-FRB</i> strain at different times after rapamycin treatment. The promoter regions of <i>SWR1</i> itself and <i>FUN12</i> were chosen because these sites are known to be enriched for SWR1 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ranjan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Yoshida et al., 2010</a>) and exhibited strong changes in H2A.Z dynamics upon TBP depletion (<a href=\"#fig1s9\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 9B</a>). Rather than accumulating at the promoters of these two genes, SWR1 dissociated shortly after TBP-FRB depletion as demonstrated by the decrease in Swr1 ChIP signal (<a href=\"#fig1s9\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 9C</a>). This observation supports the idea that the PIC is required to actively evict H2A.Z nucleosomes. In addition, the coincidental accumulation of H2A.Z and depletion of SWR1 suggest that endogenous SWR1 dissociates from promoters after depositing H2A.Z. This is in agreement with the <i>in vitro</i> observation that SWR1 has a lower affinity for the homotypic H2A.Z nucleosome product than the homotypic H2A nucleosome substrate (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ranjan et al., 2015</a>)."

Their promoters are unusual in that the endogenous +1 nucleosomes are generally depleted for H2A.Z but relatively enriched for H2A (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>,\u00a0n = 128). Upon depletion of TBP, relative H2A.Z accumulates dramatically at the +1 position (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, green). The data suggest that H2A.Z deposition occurs at the RP gene promoters but that H2A.Z nucleosomes are quickly removed by a mechanism that is dependent on TBP, leading to a low steady-state H2A.Z occupancy. Interestingly, Rpb1 depletion led to almost no change in H2A.Z occupancy at the +1 nucleosomes of RP genes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since RP genes promoters are occupied by high level of PIC components (indicated by the TFIIB marker Sua7), partial PIC may remain bound after Rpb1 depletion. This suggests that H2A.Z removal at the RP genes requires TBP but not Pol II."

Before TBP-depletion, the +1 nucleosomes associated with moderately or infrequently transcribing genes exhibited &gt;40% (median) relative H2A.Z occupancy for genes with &lt;16 mRNA/hr (n = 3,887) and ~30% (median) for those with 16\u201350 mRNA/hr (n = 219). For the top 3% of most highly transcribing genes (&gt;50 mRNA/hr, n = 161) the steady-state H2A.Z occupancy is ~11% (median) before TBP-depletion. Upon rapamycin treatment, substantial increase of relative H2A.Z occupancy is observed in all groups (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The increase is more dramatic in the most highly transcribing genes, suggesting that the low steady-state H2A.Z occupancy is due to strong transcriptional activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, &gt;50 mRNA/hr). Interestingly, when these highly transcribing genes were sorted based on the enrichment of SAGA or TFIID (<a href=\"#bib8\">Basehoar et al., 2004</a>), H2A.Z accumulated to a smaller extent for the SAGA-enriched genes than for the TFIID-enriched genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <i>right</i>). Therefore, unlike the strong TFIID-enriched promoters where low steady-state +1 H2A.Z level is due to robust PIC-dependent H2A.Z eviction activity, low H2A.Z at the strong SAGA-enriched promoters is due to either strong PIC-independent eviction or weak SWR1-mediated H2A.Z deposition or both."

Since SWR1-mediated H2A.Z deposition requires Swc5, a subunit of the SWR1 complex (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wu et al., 2005</a>), anchor-away was utilized to deplete Swc5 so as to conditionally block H2A.Z deposition. SWR1 activity of the <i>SWC5-FRB</i> strain was strongly inhibited after 30 min of rapamycin treatment as demonstrated by the robust loss of H2A.Z occupancy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A\u2013B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). When the relative H2A.Z levels (H2A.Z/input) of the +1 nucleosomes were sorted and grouped by the transcriptional frequency of the downstream genes, almost background level of H2A.Z was observed in all groups, indicating that robust, constitutive H2A.Z eviction at the +1 position occurs at both active and infrequently transcribed genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). To further understand how fast is the eviction of H2A.Z, relative H2A.Z levels were measured at various time points after Swc5 depletion (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). At most +1 positions, relative H2A.Z levels dropped below 50% of endogenous levels after 15 min of rapamycin treatment, indicating that the occupancy half-life of H2A.Z is less than 15 min. Since virtually baseline level of H2A.Z remains after 60 min of rapamycin treatment (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <i>red</i>), the data also suggests that SWR1 is the sole deposition pathway of H2A.Z at budding yeast promoters."

Consistent with the idea that the PIC is required for H2A.Z eviction, depleting both TBP and Swc5 in the double mutant resulted in a less dramatic decrease in relative H2A.Z occupancy at most +1 nucleosomes as compared to the single <i>SWC5-FRB</i> mutant for the same duration (i.e. 30 min) of rapamycin treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3D\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). It is noteworthy that TBP depletion did not completely prevent the depletion of H2A.Z caused by Swc5 depletion. One explanation is that the kinetics of TBP depletion by anchor away is slower than that of Swc5. Alternatively, a PIC-independent H2A.Z eviction pathway might be operating."

Therefore, inactivation of the <i>INO80</i> gene (which encodes the catalytic core subunit of the INO80 complex) in cells with intact SWR1 activity is expected to accumulate H2A.Z. Endogenous <i>INO80</i> was fused to a tandem <i>FRB-GFP</i> tag to allow conditional depletion by anchor-away and visualization by fluorescence microscopy. Mutants defective for <i>INO80</i> function are hypersensitive to hydroxyurea (<a href=\"#bib65\">Shen et al., 2003</a>). Cells with <i>INO80-FRB-GFP</i> (referred to as <i>INO80-FRB</i> hereafter) exhibited slow growth in medium containing both hydroxyurea and rapamycin but not hydroxyurea alone, confirming that <i>INO80</i> function can be abolished in a rapamycin-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). As expected, in the absence of rapamycin, Ino80 was found in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huh et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C</a> at 0\u2009min +RAP). After 90 min of rapamycin treatment, Ino80 was largely dispersed from the nuclei (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These cells were then fixed by formaldehyde crosslinking and the H2A.Z and H2A levels were measured by qChIP-seq. No significant global increase of H2A.Z was observed after Ino80 depletion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Instead, nucleosomal arrays became 'fuzzier' as demonstrated by the general decrease of nucleosomal peak height and the decrease of valley depth at the linker regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <i>top</i>). By contrast, in the untagged control (no <i>FRB</i>), the density and positions of the nucleosomal arrays before and after rapamycin treatment were unchanged (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <i>middle</i>). Using the difference in nucleosomal density within the linker region between +1 and +2 as a criterion for fuzziness, the chromatin arrays of 983 genes that require Ino80 for positioning were identified by clustering analysis (k = 3). The compiled chromatin arrays of these promoters showed, upon Ino80 depletion, the -1 and +1 nucleosomes shifted away from the NDR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <i>bottom</i>). Importantly, the direction of shift at these nucleosomal positions are consistent with the published results of <i>ino80</i>\u2206 and are reproducible in both biological replicates (<a href=\"#bib81\">Yen et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

Both TBP and Rpb1 depletion caused histone octamers to reposition away from the NDR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). By contrast, no significant positional shift was observed in the nucleosomal arrays of the control cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>,\u00a0no <i>FRB</i>). Similar results were previously observed by inactivating the transcription machinery with the <i>rpb1-1</i> mutant, which contains a temperature sensitive allele of <i>RPB1</i> (<a href=\"#bib73\">Weiner et al., 2010</a>). These data are in agreement with the <i>in vitro</i> data that showed an elongating Pol II can disassemble the nucleosome in its path, while reassembling the nucleosome at a position slightly more upstream (<a href=\"#bib14\">Clark and Felsenfeld, 1992</a>). But unlike the <i>rpb1-1</i> data, which exhibited strong downstream shift in the +1 nucleosomes under the non-permissive condition, the +1 shift upon TBP and Rpb1 depletion was comparatively minor (<a href=\"#bib73\">Weiner et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In fact, the nucleosomal positional shift is progressively more dramatic towards the 3\u2019 end of the genes in the TBP and Rpb1 depletion experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Interestingly, the positional shift caused by Rpb1 depletion is greater than that caused by TBP depletion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). One explanation for the difference is that TBP depletion blocks the Pol II molecules that are initiating but not those that have already engaged in elongation, whereas Rpb1 depletion removes all Pol II from the genome. But in both cases, the size of the NDR remains largely unchanged before and after the depletion of TBP or Rpb1 indicating that the formation of the NDR can be established in the absence of the PIC."

Indeed, when promoters were sorted based on the orientation of the upstream gene, positive \u2206(Z/A) values were more often seen in the upstream region of a promoter with a divergent-oriented gene (<i>Head-Head</i>) than with a tandem-oriented gene (<i>Head-Tail</i>) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Venters and Pugh, 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

An earlier study showed that TBP-FRB can be depleted from Pol I and Pol III promoters to ~60% and ~10% of the original levels, respectively, using the same duration of rapamycin treatment (<a href=\"#bib21\">Grimaldi et al., 2014</a>). Contrastingly, at the Pol I-dependent <i>RDN37</i> promoter, depletion of TBP-FRB actually caused modest H2A.Z depletion and H2A accumulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The Pol III-dependent tRNA genes have intragenic promoters (<a href=\"#bib63\">Schramm and Hernandez, 2002</a>). These genes are typically flanked by nucleosomes with low H2A.Z content (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albert et al., 2007</a>). After TBP depletion, the flanking nucleosomes showed only a subtle increase in H2A.Z (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). However, there is a substantial encroachment of nucleosome density (presumably H2A-containing) within the tRNA gene-associated NDRs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6C\u2013D</a>). These results suggest that the assembly or activity of the Pol III transcription machinery is important for creating the NDRs at these sites."

An outstanding question is whether these fragile nucleosomes contain H2A.Z (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pradhan et al., 2015</a>). In some of our qChIP-seq experiments, where the chromatin was under-digested, fragile nucleosomes were observed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <i>cyan arrowhead</i>). Strikingly, fragile nucleosomes are completely devoid of H2A.Z. The phenomenon is more obvious when sequencing tags around the dyads of 1,953 fragile nucleosomes were compiled (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kubik et al., 2015</a>). When H2A.Z eviction is blocked by TBP depletion, no H2A.Z accumulation was observed at the fragile nucleosome positions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6E\u2013F</a>). This indicates H2A.Z deposition does not occur at these sites. The lower signal in input of the + RAP sample over the fragile nucleosome was due to slight over-digestion. Overall, our data suggest that H2A.Z deposition and eviction are highly localized at the +1 nucleosomes of Pol II-transcribed genes."

Indeed, the \u2206(Z/A) parameter correctly marked the start sites of many previously annotated cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <i>red arrows, CUT531</i> and <i>CUT445)</i> and noncoding RNAs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <i>cyan arrows, SUT013</i> and <i>ICR1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bumgarner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Xu et al., 2009</a>). To identify novel start sites, the \u2206(Z/A) profiles around the dyads of all 61,568 annotated nucleosomes of the yeast genome (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kubik et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jiang and Pugh, 2009</a>)\u00a0were sorted by <i>k</i>-means clustering (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Since the +1 nucleosome is expected to have a maximum of \u2206(Z/A) signal centered around the dyad as opposed to a +2 or -1 nucleosome, which should have an off-centered \u2206(Z/A) maximum contributed by the +1 neighbor, nucleosomes with symmetrically distributed \u2206(Z/A) signal were selected (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The process was reiterated again with the remaining nucleosomes (n = 56,193) to identify +1 nucleosomes with weaker \u2206(Z/A) signals (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This approach identified 4,576 potential +1 nucleosomes, of which 3,684 were known +1 nucleosomes (n\u00a0= 6,427) of protein-coding and noncoding genes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jiang and Pugh, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kubik et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rhee et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

CUTs are normally degraded by the RNA surveillance machinery but accumulate in the exosome subunit mutant <i>rrp6\u2206</i> (<a href=\"#bib79\">Xu et al., 2009</a>). Many of the new +1 nucleosomes are associated with subtle, unannotated CUTs revealed by the <i>rrp6\u2206</i> strain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <i>grey bars</i>).

For any given promoter, these proteins apparently do not co-exist but transiently bind and dissociate in a regulated fashion to set up a chromatin environment in and around the NDR that promotes an accurate transcriptional response. The challenge is to understand how these factors are recruited and dislodged, how they regulate the dynamics of chromatin structure, and in what order these steps occur. This work demonstrates that rapid, constitutive turnover of H2A.Z occurs genome-wide, even at infrequently transcribing genes. At the nucleosomes covering or immediately downstream of the start sites of Pol II transcripts, the relative enrichment of H2A.Z is a steady state maintained by two major opposing forces imposed by the SWR1 complex and the transcription machinery. SWR1 converts H2A nucleosomes to the H2A.Z-containing forms (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, step I) and the transcription machinery then actively disassembles them."

As for the infrequently transcribed genes, one could argue that the NDRs of these promoters might be occupied with partial PICs that may become accessible to SWR1 binding when TBP or Pol II is removed. Our data argue against this hypothesis in that Swr1 occupancy decreased, rather than increased, in response to TBP depletion. Therefore, it is the SWR1 complex already residing at the NDR before TBP depletion that is responsible for the increased H2A.Z deposition. However, since the Swr1 occupancy data are based on two promoters (with reliable Swr1 ChIP signal), aberrant SWR1 recruitment elsewhere in the genome cannot be ruled\u00a0out."

As such, after SWR1 has generated the H2A.Z nucleosome product, the enzyme dissociates from the NDR.

Currently, it is not known whether the heterotypic AZ or the homotypic ZZ form is the preferred nucleosomal state for disassembly as our experiments did not distinguish between these forms. One explanation for the preference of H2A.Z eviction is that the PIC preferentially assembles on promoters that have a +1 H2A.Z nucleosome. Consistent with this idea, optimal TBP recruitment during oleate induction requires H2A.Z and the C-terminal domain of H2A.Z has been reported to bind RNA Pol II (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adam et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wan et al., 2009</a>). Another nonexclusive possibility is that H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes are preferentially recognized by the PIC for disassembly. As such, when the PIC is fully engaged with the +1 H2A.Z nucleosome, some component(s) of the PIC actively disassembles the nucleosome, thereby allowing rapid, robust transcriptional activation. In support of this idea, rapid induction of <i>GAL1-10, PHO5</i> and the heat-responsive genes requires H2A.Z and is accompanied by preferential eviction of H2A.Z over H2A (<a href=\"#bib61\">Santisteban et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Venters et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zhang et al., 2005</a>).

In the current study, the input nucleosomal levels at the +1 positions were largely unchanged for most genes upon TBP (or Rpb1) depletion. This discrepancy may be an artifact caused by a normalization step in our study that equalizes the input tag counts of all samples. Therefore, if inhibition of transcription had indeed caused a global increase in nucleosomal levels, the input nucleosome of the TBP depleted sample would be undercounted. But because the qChIP-seq approach reports H2A.Z IP efficiency, even if the input nucleosome occupancy were indeed higher in the TBP depleted sample, the absolute increase of H2A.Z would in fact be greater in response to TBP depletion, further supporting our conclusion. Furthermore, the TBP depleted sample does not appear to be severely undercounted, as the least transcribed genes (bottom 3%) exhibited similar input nucleosome densities after normalization (<a href=\"#fig1s10\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 10</a>). Interestingly, another group has previously used MNase-seq to probe the change of chromatin organization in the <i>rpb1-1</i> mutant and showed that the +1 nucleosomes also\u00a0did not accumulate when transcription was blocked (<a href=\"#bib73\">Weiner et al., 2010</a>). We speculate that PIC-dependent disassembly of the +1 H2A.Z nucleosomes involves some metastable sub-nucleosomal intermediates (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ramachandran et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rhee et al., 2014</a>). Since the DNA associated with the sub-nucleosomal species is likely hypersensitive to MNase digestion, it would be underrepresented in our input fraction. By contrast, standard H3 ChIP is likely less biased against the sub-nucleosomal species and therefore revealed H3 accumulation when transcription was blocked (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ansari et al., 2014</a>)."

It is currently unknown which step of the transcription process causes H2A.Z eviction. However, we speculate that promoter scanning mediated by TFIIH is the driving force (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, step II-b). A recent single-molecule study showed that yeast PIC repeatedly scans the promoter over an extended region (85 base pairs on average), leading to cycles of transcription bubble formation and collapse before committing to promoter escape (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fazal et al., 2015</a>). Formation of such extended transcription bubbles in the NDR will overwind the DNA downstream, leading to a propensity to form positive supercoils in the +1 nucleosomal region. Given that DNA wraps the histone octamer in a left-handed turn (i.e. negative writhe) and that the promoter-distal end of the nucleosome is restricted to rotate freely, positive supercoiling will likely destabilize the +1 nucleosome. Repeated cycles of futile scanning without promoter escape may also occur at infrequently transcribing genes explaining the constitutive H2A.Z dynamics at those promoters. Although we favor a model in which H2A.Z eviction is a direct consequence of the initiation process, we cannot exclude the possibility that a subsequent step of transcription, such as promoter escape or elongation, is the driving force as TBP depletion blocks all steps of transcription. We also cannot exclude TBP or the integrity of the PIC may be required to recruit another factor that functions to disassemble H2A.Z nucleosomes."

Sites with strong H2A.Z dynamics were able to identify not only initiation sites of protein coding genes, SUTs and CUTs, but also sites that are masked by upstream transcripts. Although this approach cannot pinpoint the location of a TSS at base pair resolution, the sites are generally restricted within the identified +1 nucleosome near the edge adjacent to the NDR. Importantly, since PIC-dependent H2A.Z eviction is linked to an NDR, the direction of the predicted transcripts can be inferred based on the location of the NDR and is almost always pointing away from the NDR. Another limitation of this approach is that it may not identify the TSSs of promoters that are associated with low endogenous H2A.Z deposition activity and/or have low PIC-dependent H2A.Z eviction activity as in\u00a0the case of the SAGA-dominating promoters."

Evidence supporting this idea comes from <i>in vitro</i>\u00a0experiments showing that the INO80 complex can mediate a reaction that replaces the nucleosomal H2A.Z-H2B dimer with H2A-H2B, which supposedly opposes the reaction catalyzed by SWR1 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Papamichos-Chronakis et al., 2011</a>), as well as <i>in vivo</i>\u00a0experiments showing a global increase of H2A.Z occupancy in <i>ino80\u2206</i> or <i>arp5\u2206</i> (both components of the INO80 complex) strains (<a href=\"#bib47\">Papamichos-Chronakis et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yen et al., 2013</a>). However, a more recent study showed <i>ino80\u2206</i> mutants exhibited normal H2A.Z occupancy at promoters (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jeronimo et al., 2015</a>). Our experiments agree with the latter study arguing that INO80 does not contribute to global eviction of H2A.Z, as no accumulation of H2A.Z was observed when Ino80 was depleted. One explanation for the discrepancy between these various experiments is that <i>ino80</i>\u2206 and <i>arp5\u2206</i> are both associated with genome instability, resulting in aneuploidy that complicates the interpretation of genomic data (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chambers et al., 2012</a> and Ashby Morrison personal communication). To circumvent this problem, we assayed H2A.Z occupancy within two hours of conditionally depleting Ino80 from the nucleus, thereby minimizing aneuploidy. Furthermore, the previous studies used ChIP-chip and ChIP-exo to measure H2A.Z occupancy (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jeronimo et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Papamichos-Chronakis et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yen et al., 2013</a>). However, these approaches may not be ideal for comparing H2A.Z occupancy in different strains. Standard microarray normalization involves scaling with data averages that could mask any global occupancy change (<a href=\"#bib50\">Quackenbush, 2002</a>). ChIP-exo measures the distribution of crosslinking points between the immunoprecipitated protein and DNA that could be influenced by variation of crosslinking efficiency in mutants with chromatin dynamics defects (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yen et al., 2013</a>). The qChIP-seq approach conducted here takes into account the input, flow-through, and IP fractions of each IP reaction and uses the immuno-depleted signal in the flow-through to scale the IP signal. Therefore, occupancy data reflects IP efficiency relative to input at individual nucleosomal sites and is not influenced by global occupancy change. It is also less sensitive to variation in crosslinking efficiency as formaldehyde crosslinking serves only to preserve the histone-DNA interaction during the pull down. Our data showed that Ino80 depletion did not cause H2A.Z accumulation, arguing against the INO80 remodeler being the main evictor of H2A.Z in the constitutive turnover process. This observation however is not inconsistent with INO80 being recruited to remodel specific promoters in response to induction as seen in the <i>PHO5</i> and <i>GAL</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barbaric et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rosonina et al., 2014</a>)."

First, ATP-dependent remodelers, such as RSC, are recruited to the promoter region by sequence specific DNA-binding factors to establish the NDR (<a href=\"#bib6\">Badis et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, step III-b). SWR1 is recruited to the NDR by its affinity for extended stretches of naked DNA and, to lesser extent, promoter-specific histone acetylation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ranjan et al., 2013</a>). SWR1 then converts the canonical AA nucleosome to the AZ and ZZ chromatin states sequentially (<a href=\"#bib41\">Luk et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, step I). For promoters that contain a fragile nucleosome within the NDR region (omitted in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> for simplicity), this structure is somehow refractory to the SWR1-mediated histone replacement reaction. SWR1 dissociates from the promoters after depositing H2A.Z at the +1 position due to its lower affinity for the H2A.Z nucleosomal product (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ranjan et al., 2015</a>).\u00a0The PIC assembles at the NDR adjacent to the newly formed +1 H2A.Z nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</a>). At some point when the PIC engages the TSS, the H2A.Z nucleosome disassembles. This may involves sub-nucleosomal intermediates before all histones are completely evicted from the DNA. Following promoter escape or unproductive dissociation of the PIC, a nucleosome with the major histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, reassembles completing the histone cycle (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, step III-a)."

We show that the Pol II transcription machinery has a major contribution to the eviction step of H2A.Z in the histone cycle. Together, chromatin remodelers and the transcription machinery choreograph the movement of histones within the promoter leading to a dynamic chromatin architecture conducive for transcription. How these enzymes are coordinated to set the histone cycle in motion will be the next important question."

ChIP-qPCR analysis was performed as previously described with the following modifications (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aparicio et al., 2005</a>). ChIP reactions were performed using 1.25 mg dynabeads conjugated to Protein A or G. Five microliter of anti-Swr1 was used in each ChIP reaction. qPCR was performed on a LightCycler 96 Real-Time PCR system (<i>Roche</i>). The primers used in qPCR are listed in <a href=\"#SD20-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>."

Briefly, yeast cells expressing <i>RPB3-3xFLAG</i> (yEL297) were cultured in 6\u2009L YPD to a final OD of 2. Washed cells were pulverized in Buffer E (20\u2009mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 20% Glycerol, 50\u2009mM KOAc, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1x PI) for 15\u2009min using the Freezer Mill (<i>SPEX,\u00a0Metuchen,\u00a0NJ</i>). The resulting whole cell extract was incubated with 40 U/mL of DNase I (DPRF, <i>Worthington</i>), 25 Units/mL of SUPERase RNase Inhibitor (<i>Thermo\u00a0Fisher</i>) and 10\u2009mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>\u00a0at 4\u02daC for 30\u2009min before centrifugation at 48,000 x g for 30\u2009min. Immunopurification was performed using 12\u2009mL (1-L culture equivalent) of cleared lysate and 400 \u00b5L (bed-volume) of anti-FLAG agarose (<i>Sigma-Aldrich</i>) on a rotator at 4\u02daC for 2.5\u2009hr. After washing with Buffer F (20\u2009mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 110\u2009mM KOAc, 0.1% NP-40, 1x PI), elution was performed with 400 \u00b5L of 0.5 \u00b5g/\u00b5L 3xFLAG peptide in Buffer G (20\u2009mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 110\u2009mM KOAc, 0.1% NP-40, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 1x PI) on a rotator at 4\u00baC for 2\u2009hr. RNA co-eluted with the Rpb3-3xFLAG Pol II complex was purified on a miRNeasy column (<i>Qiagen</i>) according to\u00a0the manufacturer protocol. To further enrich for the nascent Pol II RNA, ribosomal RNA was depleted\u00a0using\u00a0the Yeast Ribo-Zero kit (<i>Illumina</i>). cDNA library was prepared using the TruSeq stranded mRNA library prep kit (<i>Illumina</i>). Sequencing reads were aligned to the yeast genome with Bowtie as described above. A combination of custom Python scripts and BEDTools programs (<a href=\"#bib51\">Quinlan, 2014</a>) were used to generate the\u00a0tag coverage\u00a0data for <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>. The Pol II nascent RNA data represents the average of two biological replicates."

For example, if Z changes from 90% to 80%, (10% change), then the change in Z/A ratio would be 90/10 compared to 80/20. 9/4 = 2.25 fold. Also, this measure is biased, as it is differently sensitive at different levels of H2A.Z occupancy. If the change H2A.Z changed from 50% to 40%, the change in Z/A ratio would only be 1.5, whereas it becomes sensitive again at low H2A.Z levels. This also causes problems in the statistical treatment since Z/A ratio values vary significantly for a similar change in H2A.Z. Instead, the change in H2A.Z should be directly assessed and compared, as the authors eventually do: \"We also plotted the change of H2A.Z-over-input, \u0394(H2A.Z/input), and found this parameter less sensitive but more unbiased (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5C</a>).\" The ratio assays should be removed."

This isn't too surprising, but it's a nice result. Less convincing is an experiment arguing that depletion of the Kin28 subunit of TFIIH, which supposedly allows PIC assembly but not promoter escape, does not produce the same effect on H2A.Z. The authors want to conclude that some post-PIC, pre-escape step actively targets H2A.Z nucleosomes at +1, but here I found that their models went too far into unsupported speculation (see below)."

This indicates that the PIC normally is involved in a process that depletes H2A.Z from +1 nucleosomes countering the action of the Swr1 complex that normally acts to increase H2A.Z at these locations. This suggests that enrichment of H2A.Z at promoters is normally the result of a dynamic equilibrium between incorporation and removal. The manuscript then proceeds to show that sites of H2A.Z turnover can be used to identify cryptic start sites for transcription. These finding represent important new insights into how chromatin is organised at promoters. Overall the data are of high technical quality and presented clearly."

Therefore, the change in H2A.Z occupancy in the Swc5 single depletion is a rough estimate of H2A.Z decay rate. In theory, if PIC assembly is not involved in H2A.Z eviction, the rate of H2A.Z decay caused by Swc5 depletion should not be affected by TBP depletion. On the contrary, if the PIC is the only H2A.Z evictor <i>and</i> if the anchor-away depletion rates of TBP and Swc5 are the same, H2A.Z deposition and eviction should cancel out; therefore the steady-state H2A.Z levels should be unchanged before and after Swc5 and TBP codepletion. What we observed is that H2A.Z is depleted but to a lesser extent in the Swc5 and TBP co-depletion than in the single Swc5 depletion. This could mean that Swc5 anchor-away depletion is faster than TBP depletion and thus the deposition of H2A.Z is shut off earlier than the eviction of H2A.Z. Another explanation is that TBP and Swc5 are depleted at similar rates but the PIC is not the only H2A.Z evictor. Both of these possibilities are still in agreement with PIC being a contributor to H2A.Z eviction."

Given the documented affinity of SwrC for the free DNA in the NDR, a much simpler idea is that binding of the PIC blocks SwrC association. Depletion of TBP or Pol II would allow more Swr binding, leading to an increase in Htz1 occupancy. Even on infrequently transcribed genes, there may still be PIC assembly without productive transcription. And Swr1 may continually recycle Htz1 even on non-transcribed genes with an unoccupied NDR. These alternative possible mechanisms for changes in Htz1 occupancy should be discussed.</i>"
