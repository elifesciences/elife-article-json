We used multiplex tandem mass tag (TMT)-based whole cell proteomics to perform a comprehensive time course analysis of &gt;6500 viral and cellular proteins during HIV infection. To enable specific functional predictions, we categorized cellular proteins regulated by HIV according to their patterns of temporal expression. We focussed on proteins depleted with similar kinetics to APOBEC3C, and found the viral accessory protein Vif to be necessary and sufficient for CUL5-dependent proteasomal degradation of all members of the B56 family of regulatory subunits of the key cellular phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R5A-E). Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of HIV-infected cells confirmed Vif-dependent hyperphosphorylation of &gt;200 cellular proteins, particularly substrates of the aurora kinases. The ability of Vif to target PPP2R5 subunits is found in primate and non-primate lentiviral lineages, and remodeling of the cellular phosphoproteome is therefore a second ancient and conserved Vif function."

We used multiplex tandem mass tag (TMT)-based whole cell proteomics to perform a comprehensive time course analysis of &gt;6500 viral and cellular proteins during HIV infection. To enable specific functional predictions, we categorized cellular proteins regulated by HIV according to their patterns of temporal expression. We focussed on proteins depleted with similar kinetics to APOBEC3C, and found the viral accessory protein Vif to be necessary and sufficient for CUL5-dependent proteasomal degradation of all members of the B56 family of regulatory subunits of the key cellular phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R5A-E). Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of HIV-infected cells confirmed Vif-dependent hyperphosphorylation of &gt;200 cellular proteins, particularly substrates of the aurora kinases. The ability of Vif to target PPP2R5 subunits is found in primate and non-primate lentiviral lineages, and remodeling of the cellular phosphoproteome is therefore a second ancient and conserved Vif function."

It is therefore critical to understand how HIV has been able to multiply and spread, and why infection with HIV causes AIDS. In the evolutionary \u201carms race\u201d between viruses like HIV and the cells they infect, viruses try to enhance their ability to multiply, and cells try to resist. These interactions emphasise the processes that are most important for cells and viruses, and suggest new ways to treat HIV and other viral infections."

Greenwood, Matheson et al. use proteomics to measure how the abundance of proteins in human cells change during HIV infection, and identify new interactions between the virus and its host. The experiments distinguish more than 6500 proteins, and reveal that an HIV protein called Vif destroys several key components of a cellular protein called PP2A. Previous studies have demonstrated that PP2A plays a critical role in regulating the activities of numerous other proteins and processes in cells. Greenwood, Matheson et al. further show that other HIV-related viruses that infect monkeys, apes and even sheep can also counteract PP2A, suggesting that this interaction has been important during host and virus evolution."

We previously used multiplex whole cell proteomic analysis of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-infected fibroblasts to define expression time courses of viral and cellular proteins and identify novel proteins involved in the host-HCMV interaction, a technique we termed Quantitative Temporal Viromics (QTV) (<a href=\"#bib115\">Weekes et al., 2014</a>).

Whilst dispensible for viral replication in vitro, they are essential for pathogenesis in vivo. Nef and Vpu are multifunctional adaptors which co-opt endolysosomal and proteasomal machinery to downregulate numerous plasma membrane proteins, including their canonical substrates CD4, tetherin and MHC class I. In contrast, although Vif and Vpr are known to target cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins for proteasomal degradation, relatively few cellular substrates have been reported."

To test the utility of our approach, we focus on proteins depleted with similar kinetics to APOBEC3C, and confirm the B56 family of regulatory subunits of the key cellular phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R5A-E) to be novel Vif targets. We use large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics to demonstrate Vif-dependent remodelling of the cellular phosphoproteome during HIV infection, and show that, along with APOBEC proteins, antagonism of PP2A-B56 is an ancient and conserved Vif function."

The Nef, Vpu and Vif accessory protein targets CD4, SNAT1, APOBEC3C are found in cluster #1, where progressive downregulation and rescue by reverse transcriptase inhibitors suggest dependence on de novo viral protein synthesis (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, top left panel, and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Upregulation of proteins in cluster #3 is also likely to require de novo viral protein synthesis, and the indirect Vpu target \u03b2-catenin is found in this cluster (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, middle left panel). Conversely, reverse transcriptase inhibitor-independent regulation of proteins in clusters #2 and #4 implies a cellular response to HIV infection, or a direct effect of viral proteins in incoming virions, and the Vpr target UNG is found in cluster #2 (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, top right panel). As well as mechanistic differences, analysis using the Database for Annotation, Visualisation and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) revealed that clusters #1\u20134 contained proteins associated with distinct biological functions and processes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Whilst accumulation of some proteins in cluster #3 may be secondary to G2/M cell cycle arrest, other changes are unlikely to reflect the interferon (IFN) or unfolded protein responses, because we did not see accumulation of either the highly IFN-inducible protein ISG15 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) or proteins associated with ER stress (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>)."

Proteins which reduce permissivity for viral infection, but fail to meet strict criteria for restriction factors, may be classified as resistance factors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Goujon et al., 2013</a>). Restriction and resistance factors are characteristically increased (cellular response) or decreased (viral antagonism) during viral infection. Our temporal proteomic approach therefore identifies unsuspected viral regulation of known resistance/restriction factors, and provides a strategy for the discovery of novel host antiviral factors. Accordingly, we found the actin regulatory proteins gelsolin and CAPG (both cluster #4) to be strongly induced during HIV infection (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Actin cytoskeletal remodeling is required for virological synapse formation and cell-cell transmission of HIV (<a href=\"#bib45\">Jolly et al., 2004</a>), and gelsolin levels have been reported to control early HIV infection in macrophages (<a href=\"#bib27\">Garcia-Exposito et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, we discovered marked depletion of FMR1 (cluster #1, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a><b>, upper panel</b>) and TFAP4 (cluster #2, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a><b>, lower panel</b>) during HIV infection. Both these proteins reduce production of infectious HIV virus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Imai and Okamoto, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Pan et al., 2009</a>), but their distinct patterns of temporal expression suggest different mechanisms of viral regulation. We predict that other regulated proteins in clusters #1\u20134, without known roles in HIV infection, will also represent novel cellular resistance/restriction factors."

First, three members of the deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) biosynthetic pathway were depleted during HIV infection: thymidylate synthetase (TYMS), which catalyses the methylation of deoxyuridylate (dUMP) to deoxythymidylate (dTMP); and two subunits of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), RRM1 and RRM2, which catalyses the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a><b>, left panels</b>). HIV replication is tightly regulated by dNTP availability, and SAMHD1 (which tends to oppose the effects of RNR) is a well-described HIV restriction factor (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ayinde et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Baldauf et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hrecka et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Laguette et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Lahouassa et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Taylor et al., 2015</a>). Second, and most strikingly, all detected members of the B56 family of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) regulatory subunits (PPP2R5A, C, D and E) were profoundly depleted by HIV (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a><b>, right panels</b>). These subunits determine the specificity and localisation of PP2A holoenzymes (PP2A-B56), a ubiquitous family of heterotrimeric serine-threonine phosphatases with critical roles in many aspects of cellular physiology (<a href=\"#bib71\">McCright et al., 1996</a>). We confirmed downregulation of RRM2, PPP2R5A and PPP2R5D by immunoblot (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Because cluster #1 also contained APOBEC3C, and intracellular proteins in this cluster (including PPP2R5 subunits) show near-identical patterns of temporal expression, we hypothesised that some or all of these proteins might be novel Vif targets."

Each point represents a single phosphopeptide, plotted by its log2 (fold change in abundance) versus the statistical significance of that change. q values were determined using Limma with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing, with increasing -log2 (q value) indicating increasing significance. Phosphopeptides downregulated (red) or upregulated (green) with a fold change\u00a0&gt;\u00a02 and q value\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01 are highlighted. (<b>B</b>) Functional annotation clusters enriched amongst proteins hyperphosphorylated in the presence of HIV infection. Proteins containing phosphopeptides significantly upregulated (q values\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01) in cells infected with WT HIV compared with mock-infected cells were analysed. Enrichment of Gene Ontology Molecular Function and Biological Process terms against a background of all identified phosphoproteins was determined using DAVID. Functional annotation clusters with enrichment scores\u00a0&gt;\u00a01.3 (equivalent to a geometric mean of all included enrichment p\u00a0values&lt;0.05) were considered significant. Representative Gene Ontology terms are indicated. (<b>C</b>) PhosFate analysis of kinase activity in HIV-infected versus mock-infected cells. Data are shown for WT HIV (upper panel) and \u0394Vif HIV (lower panel). A positive activity score indicates enhanced phosphorylation of kinase-specific phosphosites in infected cells. Aurora kinases <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> (AurA/AurB; red) and other control mitotic/checkpoint kinases (PLK1, ATR and ATM; blue) are highlighted. Kinases represented in the dataset by a single target phosphosite were excluded. (<b>D</b>\u2013<b>E</b>) Comparison of phosphoproteomic dataset with previously published data for (<b>D</b>) okadaic acid-treated (<a href=\"#bib50\">Kauko et al., 2015</a>) and (<b>E</b>) kinase inhibitor-treated (<a href=\"#bib52\">Kettenbach et al., 2011</a>) HeLa cells. Each row shows a different pairwise comparison: top row, HIV WT versus mock; middle row, HIV \u0394Vif vs mock; bottom row, HIV WT vs HIV \u0394Vif. Each column shows a different inhibitor treatment. At low concentrations, MLN8054 is a selective AURKA inhibitor, but at 5 \u03bcM (as shown) reduced activity of AURKB and PLK1 is also observed. AZDZM indicates a combined analysis of selective AURKB inhibitors AZD1152 and ZM447439. BI2536 is a selective PLK1-3 inhibitor. Each scatterplot compares log<sub>2</sub> (fold change) in WT/ \u0394Vif/mock-infected cells (y axis) with log<sub>2</sub> (fold change) in inhibitor treated cells (x axis). Lines indicate linear correlation with 95% confidence areas, r<sup>2</sup> values and p values of a non-zero correlation. For each column, the most significant correlation is highlighted (red)."

We found marked activation of aurora kinase A (AURKA) and B (AURKB) in cells infected with WT but not \u2206Vif viruses (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), and confirmed this observation by comparing phosphorylation of sites listed on the PhosphoSitePlus (<a href=\"http://www.phosphosite.org/\">http://www.phosphosite.org/</a>) kinase substrate database (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hornbeck et al., 2015</a>) between WT and \u2206Vif virus infections (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

PLK1 protein abundance was upregulated in both WT and \u2206Vif infections, with enhanced phosphorylation of kinase-specific phosphosites, but no difference between WT and \u2206Vif viruses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a><b>, left panels</b>, and\u00a0<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>).

Whilst Vif variants from primate lentiviruses (including HIV-1) require CBF\u03b2 to enable proper protein folding, stability and interaction with the CUL5 E3 ligase complex (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fribourgh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Kim et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Miyagi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Salter et al., 2012</a>) and mediate APOBEC depletion (<a href=\"#bib40\">Hultquist et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Jager et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib128\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>), Vif variants from non-primate lentiviruses (including SRLV) neither interact with CBF\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kane et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib124\">Yoshikawa et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib127\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>) nor require CBF\u03b2 to antagonize their cognate APOBEC proteins (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kane et al., 2015</a>). As with APOBEC proteins, we found CBF\u03b2 but not EloB to be dispensable for degradation of HA-PPP2R5E by SRLV Vif (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>)."

Our data confirm known HIV targets, and identify many more proteins regulated by infection. Compared with other studies (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), we achieve a step-change in depth of proteomic coverage, and by utilising multiplex TMT-based quantitation, we facilitate high-resolution time-based analysis. To generate a cell surface proteomic map of HIV infection, we previously employed selective aminooxy-biotinylation of sialylated glycoproteins (Plasma Membrane Profiling; PMP) to quantitate 804 plasma membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib70\">Matheson et al., 2015</a>). Although 1030 proteins quantitated in our whole cell proteomic analysis also had Gene Ontology Cellular Component annotations suggesting localisation to the plasma membrane, there was limited overlap with our PMP dataset (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H</a><b>, upper panel</b>). The techniques are therefore non-redundant, and this is likely to reflect differential enrichment of scarce or poorly soluble/aggregate-prone glycoproteins using PMP, and intrinsic transmembrane proteins lacking significant extracellular domains or glycosylation sites using whole cell proteomics (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H</a><b>, lower panel</b>)."

Here, we develop and extend this methodology to predict cellular targets of specific HIV proteins. Whereas HCMV encodes\u00a0&gt;150 canonical ORFs (<a href=\"#bib117\">Wilkinson et al., 2015</a>), HIV-1 encodes only 9 genes and 15 proteins. Amongst these, the accessory proteins Vif, Vpr, Vpu and Nef have distinct patterns of temporal expression, and HIV-1 is therefore ideally suited to this approach. Vpu is translated from the same transcripts as Env (<a href=\"#bib95\">Schwartz et al., 1990</a>), and therefore expressed late in the viral replication cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Accordingly, cell surface proteins targeted specifically by Vpu (tetherin and SNAT1) are depleted late in the time course of infection (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and intracellular proteins known to be targeted by Vif (APOBEC3C) and Vpr (UNG) show distinct temporal profiles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

We validated this prediction by comparing changes in protein expression during WT and \u0394Vif virus infections, and demonstrated that as with APOBEC3C degradation, Vif was necessary for depletion of the PP2A regulatory subunits PPP2R5A-E. Conversely, like known Vpr-target UNG, proteins in cluster #2 are downregulated early in viral infection, in the absence of Vif, and in the presence of reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Vpr is reported to antagonize DNA repair pathways and inhibit innate immune sensing of viral nucleic acids (<a href=\"#bib57\">Laguette et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Schrofelbauer et al., 2005</a>). Interestingly, cluster #2 is markedly enriched for nucleic acid binding proteins, including proteins from families with known roles in DNA damage repair and nucleic acid sensing (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Whilst this manuscript was in preparation, downregulation of a second protein in cluster #2, helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF), was also attributed to Vpr in incoming viral particles (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hrecka et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Lahouassa et al., 2016</a>). Remarkably, as for Vif targets APOBEC3C and PPP2R5A-E, temporal profiles of Vpr targets UNG and HLTF cluster very tightly (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). Other proteins in cluster #2 with similar temporal profiles are therefore very strong candidates for novel Vpr targets, and downregulation of these proteins by Vpr may antagonize DNA repair pathways or inhibit viral nucleic acid sensing."

The\u00a0specificity of the holoenzyme is determined by the\u00a0binding of an additional regulatory subunit, encoded by a total of 15 genes, split into four families (<a href=\"#bib123\">Yang and Phiel, 2010</a>). We found Vif-dependent proteasomal degradation of all five members of the B56 family (PPP2R5A-E; also known as the B\u2019, PR61 or PPP2R5 family). Since each PP2A holoenzyme contains a single regulatory subunit, it is unlikely that depletion of individual regulatory subunits destabilizes other B56 family members. Given the high sequence similarity between B56 subunits, and the ability of Vif to deplete individual subunits expressed non-stoichiometrically in 293T cells, it is much more likely that degradation is mediated by a conserved Vif interaction domain in all five family members."

In order to confirm functional PP2A-B56 antagonism and identify relevant PP2A-B56 substrates in HIV-infected cells, we therefore carried out a comprehensive, unbiased analysis of cellular protein phosphorylation during productive HIV infection, and provide a multiplex TMT-based replicated analysis of\u00a0&gt;8500 cellular phosphopeptides. As expected, we found enhanced phosphorylation of proteins associated with Vpr-mediated activation of the DNA damage response and G2/M cell cycle arrest (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), reflecting increased activity of the mammalian checkpoint kinases ATR/ATM (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Lai et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Nakai-Murakami et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Roshal et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib113\">Vassena et al., 2013</a>).

Aurora kinase activity and abundance peak in late G2 and mitosis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bischoff et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Ly et al., 2014</a>), and PP2A-B56 holoenzymes antagonize aurora kinase functions in other systems (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bastos et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Espert et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Kruse et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib122\">Xu et al., 2013</a>). Conversely, aurora kinase activity is typically inhibited by the DNA damage response (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bensimon et al., 2011</a>), and reduced activity would therefore be expected in HIV-infected cells. Instead, we propose that Vif-mediated antagonism of PP2A-B56 sustains aurora kinase activity in the presence of the DNA damage response. Interestingly, PLK1 is also inhibited by the DNA damage response in other systems (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bensimon et al., 2011</a>), but kinase-active PLK1 is recruited to the SLX4 complex by Vpr in HIV-infected cells (<a href=\"#bib57\">Laguette et al., 2014</a>), consistent with the results of this study (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>).

It is therefore possible that Vif-mediated PP2A-B56 antagonism directly enhances cell-cell spread in vivo or in vitro in primary T cells or macrophages, but it is not currently practicable to compare replication of WT and \u0394Vif viruses on an APOBEC family-negative background in primary cells. Alternatively, PP2A-B56 antagonism may enhance HIV replication or persistence in vivo indirectly, by modulating T cell activation or macrophage polarization (<a href=\"#bib12\">Blas-Rus et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ding et al., 2015</a>). It is also possible that in other cell types or systems, such as terminally differentiated (non-cycling) macrophages, signalling through alternative kinases may be differentially amplified by Vif-mediated PP2A-B56 depletion. Nonetheless, since PP2A-B56 antagonism spans lineages of lentiviruses which are primarily tropic for both lymphocytes (primate lentiviruses) and myeloid cells (non-primate lentiviruses), it is likely that modulation of key kinases is conserved across cell types."

For example, MHC class I proteins are targeted by Nef variants of all primate lentiviruses (<a href=\"#bib104\">Specht et al., 2008</a>), and manipulation of MHC class I is a common attribute of many virus families (<a href=\"#bib83\">Randow and Lehner, 2009</a>). Here, we show that the\u00a0degradation of PP2A-B56 subunits is conserved across Vif variants from diverse HIV and SIV lentiviruses of primates, as well as a small ruminant lentivirus of sheep (SRLV). The lentiviral genus is ancient (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gifford et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Katzourakis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Keckesova et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib119\">Worobey et al., 2010</a>), and species-specific lineages have developed through virus-host co-evolution. Accordingly, the most recent common ancestor of the primate and small ruminant lentiviruses is likely to have existed in the common ancestor of primates and ruminants, approximately 100 million years ago (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hedges et al., 2015</a>). We therefore propose that degradation of PP2A-B56 subunits is a primordial feature of Vif, present in the common ancestor of primate lentiviral and SRLV Vif variants. Alternatively, Vif variants from these lineages may have independently acquired this ability. Either possibility strongly suggests a critical selective advantage for lentiviral replication or persistence in vivo."

As a control, mCherry was subcloned into pCMV-SPORT6. 293T cells were transfected in 24 well plates using Fugene 6. Each well received a transfection mix containing 135 ng NL4-3-dE-EGFP and 15 ng pMD.G. Shortly after, each well received a second transfection mix of 150 ng pCMV-SPORT6 mCherry, APOBEC3G, tetherin, TFAP4 or FMR1. The media was changed 24 hr post-infection, and 48 hr post-infection, cell supernatants were harvested. Contaminating 293T cells in the supernatants were removed by centrifugation, and a small proportion used to infect a fixed number of HeLa cells. After 48 hr, the HeLa cells were analysed by flow cytometry to determine the proportion that had become GFP positive (infected). The MOI in each well was calculated and normalized to the MOI resulting from the supernatants of 293T cells receiving mCherry."

To this end, the authors examined the abundance of more than 6500 cellular proteins over time in HIV-1 infected T cells using Tandem mass tagging and performed a validation of the data using conventional stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). Systematic analysis of cells infected with HIV-1 that are either Vif proficient or deficient reveals that the B56 family of regulatory proteins (PPPR5 A-E) of the PP2A phosphatase are depleted with kinetics similar to the known Vif target, APOBEC3C. Vif is found sufficient to deplete PPP5A-E subunits and requires all the known components of the Vif/E3 ligase complex, including CUL5, ELOB/C, CBF-\u03b2, as well as the proteasome. Through phosphoproteomic analysis of infected cells, the authors confirm that Vif induces the hyperphosphorylation of more than 200 cellular proteins, particularly substrates of the aurora kinases. Importantly, Vif-mediated depletion of PPP2R5A-E emerges as a function conserved across Vif variants from diverse HIV and SIV viruses, suggesting an important role in viral replication or persistence."

We strongly suggest removing these data from the paper and temper the claims of complete conservation. Alternatively, repeat the experiment in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> with SRLV(MVV) plus/minus Vif to prove that the downregulation of PPP2R5 components is indeed Vif-dependent. The claim of conservation is very important and needs to be carefully investigated and justified.</i> "
