Acute <i>Dnmt1</i> deletion elicits dramatic hypomethylation and genomic instability. Recovery of DNA methylation state and intestinal health is dependent on the <i>de novo</i> methyltransferase Dnmt3b. Ablation of both <i>Dnmt1</i> and <i>Dnmt3b</i> in the intestinal epithelium is lethal, while deletion of either <i>Dnmt1</i> or <i>Dnmt3b</i> has no effect on survival. These results demonstrate that Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b cooperate to maintain DNA methylation and genomic integrity in the intestinal epithelium."
