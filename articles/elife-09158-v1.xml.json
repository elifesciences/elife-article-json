An area at the base of the brain called the cerebellum controls this effort, and synchronizes our muscles by sending messages in the form of electrical signals along cells called Purkinje neurons. These signals consist of steady \u2018tonic\u2019 activity or short \u2018bursts\u2019 of activity. Previous studies in unconscious mammals suggest that these neurons can spontaneously switch between the two types of electrical signals."

Neurons in the \u2018up\u2019 state produced tonic pulses, while neurons in the \u2018down\u2019 state produced short bursts of activity with the help of an ion channel called AMPAR."

Sengupta and Thirumalai recorded the activity of motor neurons and Purkinje neurons at the same time. This revealed that Purkinje neurons receive a copy of the motor command that goes to the muscle and produce short bursts of electrical activity in response. This effect required AMPAR activity, and was blocked by molecules that inhibit AMPAR. Furthermore, Sengupta and Thirumalai report that the timing of these short bursts with respect to the motor command changes from one Purkinje neuron to another. Future work will investigate how the Purkinje neurons receive and process the information in the motor command."

                        "text": "Zebrafish are a convenient model system for studying the intracellular dynamics of Purkinje neurons using whole-cell patch clamp recording in vivo in the context of simple motor behaviors. The zebrafish cerebellum has three major parts namely, the corpus cerebelli (CCe), the valvula cerebelli (Va) and the vestibulo lateral lobe which is subdivided into eminentia granularis and lobus caudalis cerebelli (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hibi and Shimizu, 2012</a>). Of these only the CCe and Va show the characteristic three layered architecture (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hashimoto and Hibi, 2012</a>). We have focused on Purkinje neurons in the CCe. The structure and circuitry of CCe in zebrafish are similar to that seen in electric fish and in mammals (<a href=\"#bib28\">Meek et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hashimoto and Hibi, 2012</a>). As in mammals, Purkinje neurons in zebrafish also receive excitatory inputs from parallel fibers (PFs) and climbing fibers (CFs) and inhibition from stellate cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Purkinje neurons in zebrafish, similar to mammalian Purkinje neurons, also have large planar dendritic arbors decorated with spines (<a href=\"#bib29\">Miyamura and Nakayasu, 2001</a>). However, unlike mammals, zebrafish Purkinje neurons do not project to deeper layers but to efferent cells whose somata are present in the Purkinje cell layer or slightly ventral to it (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Takeuchi et al., 2015</a>). These efferent cells, also called the eurydendroid cells, receive short axons from the Purkinje neurons, send long projections outside the cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Heap et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Takeuchi et al., 2015</a>) and are equivalent to the mammalian deep cerebellar nuclear cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Zebrin II (aldolase-c, fructose bis-phosphate, a; <i>aldoca</i>) is expressed in all Purkinje neurons in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib29\">Miyamura and Nakayasu, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2009</a>), although it is expressed in only a subset of Purkinje neurons in mammals (<a href=\"#bib9a\">Dor\u00e9 et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brochu et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Leclerc et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sillitoe et al., 2004</a>) and birds (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pakan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Iwaniuk et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Corfield et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Vibulyaseck et al., 2015</a>). We use the <i>aldoca</i> promoter to fluorescently label Purkinje neurons specifically so as to target them for whole-cell patch clamp recordings (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tanabe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Takeuchi et al., 2015</a>)."

Previous studies using calcium imaging and extracellular recording have shown that Purkinje neurons are electrically active at 6\u20137 dpf (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahrens et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hsieh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Matsui et al., 2014</a>). Here, we undertake a thorough characterization of spontaneous activity patterns in Purkinje neurons of larval zebrafish. We show that zebrafish Purkinje neurons exhibit membrane bistability in vivo and that the state changes are dependent on AMPAR-mediated CF inputs."

We recorded from 7 dpf larvae showing mosaic expression of <i>aldoca:gap43-Venus</i> in Purkinje neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013F</a>). All cells had input resistances of above 800 M\u2126 (2.8 \u00b1 0.75 G\u2126, N = 13 cells) and capacitance ranging from 5.6 to 18 pF (13 \u00b1 2.1 pF). Resting membrane potential varied from \u221240.5 mV to \u221260.2 mV (\u221250.3 \u00b1 2.1 mV). As observed in the extracellular recordings, we found mainly two modes of spontaneous activity when we recorded in whole cell mode: bursting and tonic (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). 6 out of 13 cells showed bursts of activity punctuated by large amplitude events (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, blue arrowheads), while the rest showed tonic spiking interspersed with broad spikes and large amplitude events (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>, green and blue arrowheads respectively). Cells in the bursting mode showed narrow attenuated spikes riding atop depolarizations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, red arrowheads). Spikes were of larger amplitude and occurred at higher frequencies during bursts than in the tonic mode (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Narrow attenuated spikes, broad spikes and large amplitude events had distinct peak amplitudes and kinetics (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; Source data in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Table 1\u2014source data 1</a>). By comparison with in vitro recordings of Purkinje neurons in the central lobe of mormyrid fish (<a href=\"#bib13\">Han and Bell, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">de Ruiter et al., 2006</a>), we concluded that the narrow spikes were sodium-dependent action potentials, broad spikes were calcium-mediated spikes and the large amplitude events were CF EPSPs. Nevertheless, since these are the first intracellular recordings from zebrafish Purkinje neurons, we next confirmed that this was indeed the case."

Broad spikes were abolished after exposure to 200 \u03bcM Cadmium chloride (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), thus indicating that these events are calcium spikes triggered when the cell is depolarized. Calcium spikes were seldom observed in cells that were in the bursting mode, but were much more prevalent in the tonic mode (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>; N = 7 cells)."

Similar to the mormyrid CF-EPSPs, these large amplitide events were always about 50 mV in amplitude and had a sharp peak and a broad shoulder (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, inset and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). To test whether the large amplitude events are of synaptic origin, we depolarized and hyperpolarized the neuron and measured peak amplitude and inter-event intervals at various membrane potentials. As will be expected of synaptic events, we observed that the peak amplitude decreased linearly with increasing depolarization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, Pearson's r = \u22120.8, p &lt; 0.001, N = 5 cells), while the inter-event interval did not change (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; Pearson's r = \u22120.04, p = 0.33). To confirm that the large amplitude events are AMPA-receptor mediated CF synaptic inputs, we recorded in voltage clamp mode and bath applied various glutamatergic receptor antagonists. In the presence of the NMDAR blocker APV, the large amplitude events were not affected (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, N = 5 cells). However, the AMPAR blocker CNQX completely abolished the large amplitude events (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; N = 12 cells), thus showing that these are indeed AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents. Consistent with this, these events reversed at around +12 mV (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), close to AMPAR reversal potential. We next stimulated the CFs at their point of entry into the cerebellum in the presence of APV and Gabazine to eliminate NMDAR-dependent and GABA<sub>A</sub>R-dependent synaptic responses. At low stimulation intensities, no response was seen (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, flat line). As the stimulus amplitude was gradually increased, large amplitude EPSCs similar in size to the spontaneously occurring large amplitude events were seen (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). These were all-or-none in that no EPSCs of intermediate amplitudes were seen. When CNQX was added to the bath, the all-or-none CF EPSCs were completely abolished, confirming that the large amplitude events are AMPAR mediated all-or-none CF EPSPs."

We next wanted to investigate if there were two distinct populations of Purkinje neurons or whether the same neurons can toggle between these two states. As mentioned above, blocking synaptic receptors with APV, CNQX and Bicuculline/Gabazine eliminates bursting and causes the neurons to show tonic spiking (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; N = 5 cells). We also found that Purkinje neurons could spontaneously toggle between the bursting and tonic states (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). 3 out of 8 tonic cells spontaneously hyperpolarized during the course of our recording and entered the bursting state. Conversely, 4 out of 11 cells spontaneously depolarized and toggled from the bursting to tonically firing state. We examined the basal membrane potential in bursting and tonic cells and found that tonic cells were significantly more depolarized (\u221243.7 \u00b1 1.1 mV, N = 8 cells) compared to bursting cells (\u221256.3 \u00b1 1.6 mV; N = 11 cells; p &lt; 0.001; Mann\u2013Whitney; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In addition, 4 of 4 bursting cells could be made to fire tonically by depolarizing them and 4 of 4 tonic cells could generate bursts when they were hyperpolarized with negative current. When we bath applied CNQX, APV and Bicuculline, tonic cells lost the ability to generate bursts upon hyperpolarization and became silent (N = 5 cells). To understand which synaptic receptors were involved in triggering bursts, we bath applied Gabazine, APV or CNQX individually. In the presence of 40 \u03bcM APV (N = 5 cells) Purkinje neurons were still able to generate bursts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In the presence of 10 \u03bcM Gabazine (N = 10 cells), bursts, though of altered shape and amplitude, could still be seen (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). However, 20 \u03bcM CNQX completely abolished bursting behavior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>; N = 12 cells), indicating that AMPAR and not GABA<sub>A</sub>R or NMDAR were responsible for triggering bursts in the hyperpolarized state. From these experiments, we conclude that Purkinje neurons have two stable states. Tonic spiking occurs in the \u2018up\u2019 state and when the neurons are in the \u2018down\u2019 state, AMPAR-mediated synaptic inputs can toggle the cell to \u2018up\u2019 states thus generating bursts."

We hypothesized that CF EPSPs can be the source of AMPAR-mediated strong excitation that toggles the Purkinje neuron to \u2018up\u2019 states. If this were true, burst onsets must be highly correlated with CF-EPSPs. Indeed, we observed that burst initiation was usually marked by the presence of CF-EPSPs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, blue arrowheads). When the burst initiation was calculated from the first sodium spike (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, red arrowhead), we observed a significant increase in the number of CF-EPSPs from an average of 32.34 events per 200 ms bin to 92 events in a 200 ms bin immediately preceding the spike (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>; N = 5 cells; p &lt; 0.001; Chi-square test).

                                "text": "To determine the functional relevance of toggling between states, we recorded intracellularly from Purkinje neurons while simultaneously recording fictive motor patterns. We found that motor episode initiation was usually accompanied by the initiation of bursting in the Purkinje neuron (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>; N = 5 cells). Since bursting was triggered by CF-EPSPs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), we first sought to determine whether motor episode initiation was accompanied by increased incidence of CF-EPSPs. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> shows a raster plot of CF EPSPs with respect to motor episode initiation across 43 motor episodes and 5 Purkinje neurons. The duration of each motor episode is shown by the length of the green-shaded box. CF-EPSPs tended to be clustered around the initiation of motor episodes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> and 0 on x-axis). The number of CF-EPSPs occurring within a 1 s window after motor episode initiation (169) was significantly higher than average (40, p &lt; 0.001, Chi-square test; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). To determine whether the increased incidence of CF-EPSPs in this window, resulted in increased bursting in the Purkinje neuron, we plotted the membrane potential of Purkinje neurons within a 1 s window around the start of motor episodes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). In the cell shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, CFs triggered depolarization within 500 ms after the initiation of motor episodes in 80.4% trials, while in 17% trials, the CF-triggered depolarization occurred within 500 ms before motor onset. In 3% trials, the cell did not show significant change in membrane potential in this window. We next compared motor-episode related bursting across the 5 Purkinje neurons we recorded from by computing average membrane potential in a 1 s window around the start of motor episodes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). The membrane potential at +0.5 s was significantly higher by 17 \u00b1 0.93 mV (N = 107 trials, p &lt; 0.001) than that at \u22120.5 s, when motor episodes were aligned at 0 s (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>). However, depolarization latency and reliability were variable across the cells we recorded from. We found that motor episode-related, CF-triggered bursting was evoked in more than 80% trials in some neurons (cells 3, 4, and 5) while it was relatively less reliable in others (77% for cell 1 and 50% for cell 2). Additionally, the average latency from motor episode onset to depolarization onset was also variable from one motor episode to another within the same cell (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>) and from one cell to the other (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Taken together, these data indicate that the initiation of motor episodes is accompanied by an increased incidence of CF-EPSPs in the Purkinje neuron, which toggle it to the \u2018up\u2019 state. However, individual Purkinje neurons exhibit variability in how they represent the time of initiation of motor episodes."

We recorded at 4 dpf, which is the earliest time point when Purkinje neurons can be unequivocally identified. At this stage, the spontaneous activity was indistinguishable from that seen at 7 dpf. Both bursting and tonic Purkinje neurons were present (N = 5 cells in tonic mode, 2 cells in bursting mode). CF-EPSPs could be identified, and narrow sodium spikes as well as broad calcium spikes were also present (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, top trace). At 19 dpf, the latest stage we recorded from, again we were able to detect CF-EPSPs, sodium spikes and calcium spikes. Of 10 cells recorded at 19 dpf, 7 were tonically firing and 3 were bursting (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, bottom trace). As in 7 dpf larvae, both at 4 dpf and at 19 dpf, tonic and bursting cells could be mode-switched by hyperpolarization and depolarization respectively. However, one key point of difference was that at 19 dpf, we observed fewer CF-EPSPs as compared to 4 dpf or 7 dpf. To determine if the number of CF inputs is reduced between 7 dpf and 19 dpf, we recorded CF-EPSCs in voltage clamp mode at 4 dpf, 7 dpf and 19 dpf. We found that the peak amplitude and inter-event interval of CF-EPSCs increased significantly between 7 dpf and 19 dpf (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013D</a>, p &lt; 0.0001, Kruskal\u2013Wallis), thus confirming that as the larva matures, Purkinje neurons receive fewer but stronger CF EPSCs. The coefficient of variation of CF-EPSC peak amplitude was 0.6 at 4 dpf, 0.5 at 7 dpf and 0.4 at 19 dpf, suggesting a gradual pruning of CF inputs from 4 dpf to 19 dpf."

Burst firing happens when the membrane is transiently toggled to \u2018up\u2019 states and these transitions to \u2018up\u2019 states can be driven by AMPAR mediated excitation. We have shown that CF inputs are the source for the strong AMPAR excitation required for these state transitions. Furthermore, initiation of motor episodes is highly correlated with higher incidence of CF EPSPs and toggling to \u2018up\u2019 states. Our data suggest that Purkinje neurons may utilize CF-driven bistability to create a distributed representation of the timing of motor events. In sum, we show functionally relevant bistability in Purkinje neurons that is driven by olivary input."

This preparation allows us to study intracellular membrane potential dynamics of Purkinje neurons in vivo in the context of fictive motor output. However, because it is a larval animal, it is possible that the bistability that we observe is the property of a developing network and that it may not be present in the mature cerebellum of the adult. Nevertheless, other factors suggest that the cerebellum is functionally mature at least by 7 dpf and that the bistability observed is integral to this function. Purkinje neurons are born at \u223c3 dpf (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hamling et al., 2015</a>) and are electrically active at the earliest stage we recorded from, that is, 4 dpf. The cerebellar layers and synaptic contacts onto Purkinje neurons are observed as early as 5 dpf (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2009</a>). Calcium imaging in 6\u20137 dpf larvae has revealed Purkinje neurons to be active during optomotor and optokinetic responses (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahrens et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Matsui et al., 2014</a>). Optogenetic silencing of Purkinje neurons interfered with optomotor and optokinetic responses in larval zebrafish of this age (<a href=\"#bib26\">Matsui et al., 2014</a>). The cerebellum has been shown to be involved in associative learning in adult vertebrates such as goldfish, rodents, rabbits and non-human primates (<a href=\"#bib41\">Thompson and Steinmetz, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">G\u00f3mez et al., 2010</a>). Ablation of the entire CCe in 6\u20138 dpf zebrafish larvae resulted in deficits in associative learning in a classical conditioning paradigm (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aizenberg and Schuman, 2011</a>). These studies provide support to the idea that the functioning of the larval cerebellum is analogous to its function in the adult and that the activity patterns we recorded are functionally relevant in the larva and in the adult."

The cerebellum or \u2018little brain\u2019 is one of the oldest parts of the vertebrate brain and is present in all vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bell, 2002</a>). Among gnathostomes, the circuitry of the cerebellum is remarkably conserved with most major cell types being present in the cerebellums of cartilaginous fish, bony fish, and tetrapods (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nieuwenhuys et al., 2014</a>). Although zebrafish and mammals diverged from a common ancestor 450 million years ago, structurally, the cerebellum of zebrafish shows a high degree of similarity with mammalian cerebellar circuits. Similar to mammals, zebrafish have a layered cerebellum with molecular, ganglionic and granule cell layers. Mossy fibers innervate granule cells, which relay inputs to Purkinje neurons via PFs arranged orthogonal to their dendritic arbors. Zebrafish Purkinje neurons are also spiny with elaborate dendritic arbors (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bae et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Takeuchi et al., 2015</a>)."

Unlike mammalian Purkinje neurons, zebrafish larval Purkinje neurons do not exhibit complex spikes. Instead, they show large amplitude all-or-none CF EPSPs and broad calcium spikes. In spite of such major differences, we also identified several similarities that have been evolutionarily conserved. Similar to mammalian neurons, spontaneous firing appears to be an intrinsic property of zebrafish Purkinje neurons as these neurons continue to fire at high rates even when fast synaptic transmission is blocked, as has been shown in rodent Purkinje neurons in cerebellar slices (<a href=\"#bib16\">H\u00e4usser and Clark, 1997</a>). Secondly, like in mammalian Purkinje neurons, two kinds of glutamatergic excitation are observed: strong excitation from CFs and weak excitation from PFs, both mediated by AMPA receptors (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Lastly, we demonstrated bistability in Purkinje neurons of zebrafish larvae. Though bistability in Purkinje neurons has been reported in vitro in amniotes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Llin\u00e1s and Sugimori, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Oldfield et al., 2010</a>) and in vivo under anesthesia in rodents (<a href=\"#bib25\">Loewenstein et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Schonewille et al., 2006</a>), there has been disagreement on whether it occurs in vivo under \u2018awake\u2019 conditions (<a href=\"#bib35\">Schonewille et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yartsev et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Engbers et al., 2013</a>). The zebrafish larval preparation allows us to perform intracellular recordings of membrane potential in the absence of anesthesia. Under these conditions, we observed membrane bistability and toggling between \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019 states. Based on the conservation of other structural and functional properties of the cerebellum, it seems reasonable to conclude that bistability is a conserved feature of Purkinje neurons from fish to mammals."

When Purkinje neurons are in the \u2018down\u2019 state, strong AMPAR-mediated excitation from the CFs is sufficient to trigger bursts. In zebrafish, GABAergic inhibition or NMDAR-dependent excitation seem not to be critical for generating bursts. Both a hyperpolarized membrane potential and AMPAR-mediated CF-activation were required for triggering bursts, suggesting that CF-EPSPs activate voltage-dependent conductances in the Purkinje neuron to trigger bursts. Further experiments are needed to tease out the ionic basis of the bursts triggered by CF-EPSPs."

These three properties seem to persist at least until late larval stages. Further, bistability also appears soon after Purkinje neuron specification and persists at least until 19 dpf, indicating that Purkinje neuron electrical properties mature rapidly. However, fewer CF EPSCs were seen at 19 dpf compared to 4 dpf. While this could reflect a developmental decrease in the firing rates of olivary neurons, there may also be a gradual maturation of CF inputs from many relatively weaker inputs at 4 dpf to few strong inputs at 19 dpf. In adult vertebrates, each Purkinje neuron is innervated by a single CF. Analogous to the neuromuscular junction, CF to Purkinje neuron synapses progress from polyinnervation to single innervation through a process of synapse elimination. In rodents, this process occurs during the first two weeks of post-natal life (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hashimoto and Kano, 2005</a>). It is not yet clear when the process of synapse elimination is complete in zebrafish but our data suggest a gradual decrease in the number of CF synapses onto single Purkinje neurons between 4 dpf and 19 dpf. Further morphological and physiological experiments are required to determine the earliest stage at which Purkinje neurons are innervated by single CF."

Our data reveal that initiation of motor episodes is accompanied by increase in CF inputs that depolarize the Purkinje neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Such depolarization triggers bursts, presumably by recruiting persistent sodium, high threshold calcium and calcium-dependent potassium conductances and/or due to co-incident PF inputs. Though we did not find a tonic cell during our simultaneous motor episode recordings, we propose that mode switching could serve as a \u2018clutch\u2019 that engages or disengages Purkinje neuron activity to locomotor behavior. Although cells in the tonic mode might continue to receive CF inputs during motor episodes, their simple spike rates may not be modulated to the same extent as those cells in the \u2018down\u2019 state. By mode switching from tonic to bursting, Purkinje neurons might choose to \u2018listen in\u2019 on locomotion related neural inputs."

The time to peak depolarization was different for different cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). This leads us to propose that Purkinje neurons might use CF-driven bursting to generate a distributed representation of motor events. It remains to be seen whether these CF-EPSPs play a role during motor learning. With the ability to record from Purkinje neurons intracellularly during fictive motor behavior, experiments to address the above question are within reach."

They also show that toggling to the bursting state occurs at the onset of fictive locomotion via the CF input.

This model allows in vivo patch clamp recordings while the animal generates fictive movements. The use of an in vivo model is the major strength of this study, and the data obtained in this larva are reminiscent to observations made in primates \u2013 i.e. that the onset of bistability correlates with the onset of motor bursts. The data are well presented, and the Discussion is interesting for a general readership. The significance of this study is discussed in the context of mammalian neurobiology, and the fact that the findings are in part consistent with insights gained in mammals is reassuring that the zebrafish cerebellum, despite all its major anatomical differences may have similar physiological roles. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that the zebrafish larva is not a mammal, and it is certainly not an adult mammal. Thus, it is a bit of a stretch to assume that bistability is a general principle of cerebellar function based on this study. This does not deter from the fact that the data are interesting, and that the experiments are well done. As for the data I have only a few comments:"

The authors studied bistability in relation to fictive motor bursts \u2013 which is not exactly a well-defined behavior, in particular since the activity is also fictive. While it may likely represent the onset of locomotion, the authors need to be a bit more careful. At the same time, I don't want to question the fact that there is a relationship between bistability and motor activation, but stating \u201cbehaving animal\u201d is going too far \u2013 even for someone who is a strong advocate of the analysis of fictive activity."

This study for the first time unequivocally demonstrates that bistability is an inherent property of Purkinje neurons in vivo and that the bistability is functionally important during motor episodes. Prior to this study, the existence of bistability in vivo in Purkinje neurons had been debated. As the reviewer correctly points out, the use of the larval zebrafish preparation has allowed us to record intracellularly in the absence of anesthesia and this has allowed us to address this long-standing controversy. Given the conservation of several other properties of Purkinje neurons between fish and mammals, and in light of earlier in vitro experiments in mammals where bistability was observed, the proof for bistability in zebrafish Purkinje neurons in vivo can be taken as proof of its existence in mammals in vivo. This finding in itself is significant for the broader neuroscience research community."

Exploiting this advantage, we discovered that in a 1s window after the initiation of motor episodes, the incidence of CF-EPSPs is significantly higher and that this leads to membrane depolarization and bursting. However, the exact timing of the Purkinje neuron bursts is variable. This again is a significant finding as it suggests an intrinsic circuit-based mechanism for distributed representations of motor episode timing among Purkinje neurons."
