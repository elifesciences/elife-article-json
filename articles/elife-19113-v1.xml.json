One possible explanation for this effect is that neural responses to regularly repeating scene components adapt (decrease over time) more than to random components. Indeed, perceptual influences of statistical structure have often been attributed to neural adaptation (e.g. 'stimulus specific adaptation'; <a href=\"#bib54\">May et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Haenschel et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Costa-Faidella et al., 2011</a>; ; <a href=\"#bib44\">Khouri and Nelken, 2015</a>). Accordingly, the relative change in neural response to a new spectral component (that is, the appearing source) will be larger and thus more detectable in regular versus random scenes (<a href=\"#bib78\">Summerfield et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hartmann and Goupell, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Erviti et al., 2011</a>). By this account, statistical structure does not modulate the magnitude of neural response to a new event per se. Rather, improved detection is attributed exclusively to decreased neural responses occurring before the appearance of the new source. Indeed, in a mismatch negativity paradigm, <a href=\"#bib15\">Costa-Faidella (2011)</a> demonstrated that neural responses to repeating (\u2018standard\u2019) tones adapt more in temporally regular than random sequences without accompanying changes in response to new (\u2018deviant\u2019) tones (see also <a href=\"#bib72\">Schwartze et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib71\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Tavano et al., 2014</a>)."

These effects have been interpreted to reflect a mechanism that tracks the level of predictability or \u2018precision\u2019 of the sensory input, a measure inversely related to the uncertainty or entropy of a variable. This mechanism is hypothesized to enable the up-regulation of processing for information that is reliable and likely to indicate genuine events in the environment (<a href=\"#bib24\">Feldman and Friston, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Auksztulewicz and Friston, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barascud et al., 2016</a>).

Our results provide evidence in support of precision accounts: we show that brain responses to ongoing acoustic scenes, and to new sources appearing within those scenes, increase in the presence of regular statistical structure. Strikingly, the effect of regularity on appearance detection is delayed when listeners are actively focused on the scenes rather than listening passively. This latter finding suggests (somewhat counter intuitively) that active listening can counteract the influence of regularity but is consistent with attention acting to reduce \u2018surprise\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib74\">Spratling, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chennu et al., 2013</a>)."

This difference was confirmed significant using a jackknife adjusted independent samples test (t(25) = \u22123.96, p&lt;0.001). This analysis is consistent with the cluster-based permutation statistics above also suggesting a scene structure effect on the early M50 component only in the Passive group.

By this account, the increased response for REG versus RAND scenes at the M50 does not differ between Passive and Active groups. Rather, REG scenes result in an increased M100 in Active listeners that causes a reduction in the M50 (due to their opposite polarities; see topographic plots in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To explore this possibility, we selected the twenty most positive and twenty most negative channels at the time of the M50 deflection (72\u2013112 ms; pooling over REG and RAND conditions). The MEG signal was then averaged across channels within these two (positive and negative) groupings and the resulting time-courses analyzed (shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As this analysis is based on the mean (rather than RMS) neural response across channels, the polarity of the signal is preserved and thus potentially provides a more accurate representation of the underlying dynamics. Furthermore, the selection of channels based on the M50 deflection would be expected to attenuate interfering responses from the M100 component. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, consistent with the earlier RMS analysis, the M50 showed a larger response for REG versus RAND scenes in Passive but not in Active listeners. This is despite the M100 showing no evidence of modulation by scene structure in Active listeners (even at an uncorrected threshold of p&lt;0.05), making it unlikely the pattern of results reflect a suppression of the M50 by the M100."

Neither was there a significant interaction between scene and appearing source structure. However, we cannot rule out modulation of more temporally\u00a0variable neural processes not captured by the evoked analysis employed here.

It is however consistent with a mechanism that infers the precision (predictability) of sensory input and uses this information to up-regulate neural processing towards more reliable sensory signals (<a href=\"#bib24\">Feldman and Friston, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Auksztulewicz and Friston, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barascud et al., 2016</a>). Indeed, it has recently been demonstrated that the magnitude of sustained MEG activity (from na\u00efve distracted listeners) tracks the predictability of rapid tone sequences (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barascud et al., 2016</a>). In that study, regularity was characterized by a spectral pattern repeating over time within a single ongoing tone sequence. Although distinct to the temporal regularity studied here, the ensuing effect on MEG response is strikingly similar to the sustained effect we observe. Importantly,\u00a0the current findings demonstrate mechanisms that automatically (irrespective of directed attention) and rapidly (within 400 ms of scene onset) encode regularities distributed over many concurrent sources, typical of natural listening environments."

This is may suggest a degree of neural specialization for the particular type of regularity encoded e.g. temporal-based involving parietal cortex versus spectral-based involving inferior frontal regions. Future work is required however to determine whether temporal and spectral regularities are encoded by distinct neural substrates (e.g. by contrasting neural effects of temporal and spectral regularities in the same experiment)."

After the appearance of a new source, however, regularity and attention had an interactive influence on the evoked response; whereas the first cortical deflection of the appearance-evoked response (M50) increased in regular scenes during passive listening, this effect was confined to later deflections (M100 and M200) when listeners actively detected source appearance."

In this view, attention increases precision (and neural responses) when sensory signals are task-relevant. In this case inferred precision is changed not by the intrinsic structure of the stimulus (e.g. whether temporally regular or random) but by the behavioral goals of the listener. As precision is hypothesized to have a multiplicative (gain) influence on neural activity, this account would have predicted attentional enhancement of the regularity effect. Indeed, <a href=\"#bib39\">Hsu et al. (2014)</a> demonstrated greater EEG responses for predictable (ascending) pitch patterns, which was most apparent when those patterns were embedded in an attended stream.

Thus, although counterintuitive, the later benefit from regularity when listeners are actively seeking source appearance is consistent with attention acting to reduce surprise."

In <a href=\"#bib13\">Chennu et al. (2013)</a>, listeners were presented with tone sequences containing regularities unfolding over multiple (local and global) timescales. When listeners were instructed to detect deviant tones on a local timescale, the mismatch negativity component indexing that local regularity was attenuated compared with when listeners detected global deviants. The authors interpreted this suppression effect as reflecting reduced surprise from 'top-down expectation (or bias) and consequent attentional focus'.\u00a0Similarly, <a href=\"#bib74\">Spratling (2008)</a> argues that attention and expectation are part of the same general class of top-down signal that act in a similar fashion to modulate perceptual processing. Thus, in this view, the distinction between attention and expectation is blurred and whether these phenomena result in increased or decreased neural processes will depend on the precise details of the stimuli and behavioral demands (<a href=\"#bib70\">Schr\u00f6ger et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Henson, 2016</a>). In this respect, we note that previous investigations of regularity and attention employed static or relatively slow-evolving stimuli (1\u20135\u2009Hz) and often containing a single perceptual object (image of a face or tone sequence). This may have enabled conscious awareness of stimulus content, involving distinct processes to those relevant to the rapidly evolving and complex scenes employed here and, arguably, to the perceptual challenges faced in natural environments."

This behavioral advantage was accompanied by larger and more sustained neural responses, as assessed using magnetoencephalography recordings of brain activity. The change-evoked response was initially weaker in actively attending than passively listening subjects."

In brief, this procedure involves 1) realigning and concatenating sensor-level data across subjects 2) estimating a single source solution for all subjects 3) using the resulting group solution as a Bayesian prior on individual subject inversions. Thus, this method exploits the availability of repeated measurements (from different subjects) to constrain source reconstruction. Importantly, however, this procedure does not bias activation differences between conditions in a given source.\u201d"

(2016) report effects of statistical structure in early auditory regions (like the current findings), they did not observe changes in MEG and fMRI responses in parietal cortex. Instead, spectral regularity modulated activity in the inferior frontal gyrus. This is may suggest a degree of neural specialization for the particular type of regularity encoded e.g. temporal-based involving parietal cortex versus spectral-based involving inferior frontal regions. Future work is required however to determine whether temporal and spectral regularities are encoded by distinct neural substrates (e.g. by contrasting neural effects of temporal and spectral regularities in the same experiment).\u201d"
