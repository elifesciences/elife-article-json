Our eyes and hands constantly move as we interact with the world, and these movements are controlled by the brain. According to Ahissar and Assa, a more accurate view of perception is that the brain triggers the movement of the sense organs, and thereby alters the sensory information that these organs receive. This information is relayed to the brain, triggering further movement of the sense organs and causing the cycle to repeat. Perception is therefore a \u201cclosed loop\u201d: information flows between the environment, sense organs and brain in a continuous loop with no clear beginning or end."

Repeated encounters with an object enable a brain to refine its previous impressions of that object. This can be achieved more easily with a \u2018circular\u2019 closed-loop system than with a linear open-loop one. Ahissar and Assa show that closed-loop perception can explain many of the phenomena that open-loop perception struggles to account for. This is largely because closed-loop perception considers motion to be an essential part of perception, and not an artifact that must be corrected for."

Indeed, behavioral studies revealed that although mammals can perceive events or objects while being passive, most of the time mammalian individuals seek for objects and perceive the world via active body and sensor movements (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahissar and Arieli, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Diamond et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Findlay and Gilchrist, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Halpern, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Kleinfeld et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Konig and Luksch, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Land, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Lederman and Klatzky, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib126\">Najemnik and Geisler, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib157\">Rucci et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib161\">Schroeder et al., 2010</a>). Investigating perception at the neuronal level, however, proved to be extremely challenging and neuroscientists have adopted a series of reductionist methods in which various components of the process have been eliminated. One critical such component has been sensor motion \u2013 neuroscientists have been investing enormous efforts in precluding sensor movements as these movements, naturally, interfere with systematic characterizations of neuronal responses. This passive paradigm\u00a0indeed yielded invaluable descriptions of neuronal circuits and pathways that can convey sensory information and suggested how these pathways might process sensory information. Crucially, however, passive paradigms cannot reveal how sensory information is actually processed during active perception (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahissar and Arieli, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ennis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib117\">Maravall and Diamond, 2014</a>). For that, a unified analysis of the motor and sensory components engaging brains with their environments is required."

One salient outcome of the passive reductionist approach has been the over emphasis of open-loop schemes of perception. The elimination of motor components from the experimental scheme yielded a parallel elimination of motor variables from the corresponding theoretical schemes, leaving models of perception as sensory-only open-loop schemes (e.g., <a href=\"#bib36\">Connor and Johnson, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Edelman, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib118\">Marr, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib141\">Poggio and Serre, 2013</a>). In agreement with previous suggestions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahissar and Arieli, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Dewey, 1896</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Freeman, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Kelso, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib145\">Port and Van Gelder, 1995</a>), we claim that such a reductionist paradigm should ultimately fail to elucidate neural mechanisms of natural perception. This is not to say that any reduction would fail, but to emphasize that an appropriate reductionist paradigm should leave the motor-object-sensory interactions intact. The current paper describes an attempt to bring the motor variables back to the theoretical modeling of perception, by proposing a motor-sensory closed-loop scheme for the perception of the external environment. The paper makes use of ideas previously developed in various dynamic theories (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ahissar and Vaadia, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ashby, 1952</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Kelso, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib136\">O'Regan and Noe, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib145\">Port and Van Gelder, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib147\">Powers, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib182\">Wiener, 1949</a>) and, in general, refers to the perception of external objects as a process of acquiring information about presently-existing external objects, whether consciously or not. The paper addresses perceptual acquisition - mechanisms of perceptual reports and their interactions with perceptual acquisition are not addressed here. It is noted, however, that a comprehensive understanding of perception depends on the understanding of report mechanisms as well. For simplicity, the term \u201cbrain\u201d is often used in this article in an extended form that includes the sensory organs and their affiliated nerves and muscles."

Yet, whether perceptual acquisition is considered an open-loop or closed-loop process does not depend on the existence of closed loops within the chain of processing, but on whether the entire chain of processing is closed (as a loop) or open. Thus, a perceptual process that starts at the sensory organ and ends somewhere in the brain, whether containing local loops or not, is termed here an open-loop perceptual (OLP) process (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), whereas a perceptual process that includes the sensory organ but has no starting nor ending point, is termed a closed-loop perceptual (CLP) process (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

Thus, for example, an apple activates retinal receptors, which in turn initiate a stream of activations in the brain, some of which may depend on internal loops, i.e., loops that do not include the sensory organ. An activity pattern that is repeatedly evoked in a given neuronal network in response to a presentation of the apple, and/or when such an apple is perceived, is often termed a neuronal correlate or neuronal representation (NR) of that apple. NRs are representations that are not necessarily consistent or unique, i.e., they may appear in only some of the cases in which the apple is presented or perceived, and may appear also when other objects are presented or perceived. If a specific NR is evoked in a given brain for each and every perceived appearance of the apple, is invariant to changes in internal and environmental conditions, and is unique to the apple, it can be termed \u201cthe\u201d invariant representation (IvR) of the apple in that specific brain. Assuming OLP, IvRs should be invariant to the acquisition mode. Visual IvRs of the apple, for example, should be the same in passive and active acquisition modes, i.e., when the eye is stationary and the object moves or flashes (passive mode) and when the object is stationary and the eye moves (active mode)."

Among those is the characterization of NRs of various external features along the relevant sensory streams. For example, NRs of brief presentations of visual elements, such as dots and bars, were characterized among retinal, thalamic and cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib77\">Hartline, 1938</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Hubel and Wiesel, 1962</a>). NRs of more complex visual patterns were characterized in various cortical areas (<a href=\"#bib38\">Creutzfeldt and Nothdurft, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Fujita et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib121\">McMahon et al., 2014</a>). Crucially, however, although partial invariance had been demonstrated for portions of the proposed NRs in some of the cases, none of these NRs was shown so far to be \u201cthe\u201d IvR of a specific external object or feature, namely an NR that is (at least substantially) invariant to changes in the most relevant conditions of perception. Moreover, none of these studies provides information that can discriminate between OLP and alternative hypotheses. Consider, for example, studies exhibiting single neurons that increase their firing rate significantly and selectively for a given object (e.g., a face) out of several presented objects, and for several variations of that object (<a href=\"#bib121\">McMahon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib150\">Quiroga et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib177\">Viskontas et al., 2009</a>). The critical factor here is that such a neuron cannot be considered as describing the IvR of that object, neither as describing a reliable projection of the IvR. Based on combinatorial considerations and response variations the assumption in such cases is that the elevated firing rate of such a neuron is a (tiny) component of the relevant NR, and not the NR itself. The question is, then, would the assumed NR be invariant to a sufficiently large portion of all relevant variations of object presentation and context. Given that these neurons are not completely invariant even to the limited sample of variations presented to them (as is evident from the substantial trial-by-trial variability of their responses) and their tiny contribution to the actual NR, it is impossible to infer the level of invariance of the actual NR out of the firing patterns measured from these neurons."

Clearly, these mechanisms can function within both OLP and CLP schemes of perception. Passive-mode experiments were also instrumental in describing the minimal exposure times required for generating meaningful perceptual reports. Across a large set of stimuli it was found that, depending on practice, exposure times as short as a few tens of milliseconds already allow a categorization of the presented stimulus, at least in a binary manner. As will be shown below, these findings are consistent with both OLP and CLP schemes."

In order to verify that these specific reductions of the perceptual process are scientifically valid, one has to reconstruct perception by combining back the individual identified components. Succeeding in doing so will not only validate the specific reductionist approaches used, but, more importantly, show that OLP can be considered as a valid (i.e., self-consistent) theory of perception. At this stage we can ask whether OLP is consistent with the data collected so far. We describe here several major findings that appear to be inconsistent with OLP and thus significantly challenge the validity of OLP as a mechanism for natural perception in mammals."

The strategies employed by sensory systems are often similar. Visual and tactile systems, for example, employ movements of sensory organs that contain two-dimensional arrays of receptors. The movements serve several functions. Larger movements (e.g., ocular saccades and head or arm movements) quickly move the array of receptors from one region of interest to another. Smaller (and slower) movements (e.g., fixational drifts and finger or vibrissal scanning) scan the region of interest at fine resolution (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahissar and Arieli, 2001</a>). This move-dwell-move pattern is typical for perceptual exploration across a large range of temporal scales, from minutes to less than a second (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Olfaction and taste are probably as active as touch and vision (<a href=\"#bib75\">Halpern, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Kepecs et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Mainland and Sobel, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib181\">Welker, 1964</a>).

Cross-modal effects between body and sensor movements, which are not discussed in this paper, are likely to play a significant role in perception as well (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ayaz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Fonio et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Grion et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Keller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib125\">Moore et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib129\">Niell and Stryker, 2010</a>).

First, it turns out that the common reductionist approach in which stimuli are flashed on passive sensory organs cannot be extended back to natural conditions. This is because in such experiments no information is obtained about the dependency of sensory signals on natural active interactions with the object, interactions that cannot be mimicked with passive sensors. In vibrissal touch, for example, a crucial sensory variable is the whisker curvature (<a href=\"#bib16\">Bagdasarian et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Boubenec et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib151\">Quist and Hartmann, 2012</a>), which cannot be physically mimicked with only external forces (<a href=\"#bib16\">Bagdasarian et al., 2013</a>). In vision, while the conditions accompanying an ocular drift can be mimicked, in principle, by drifting the entire visual field, the conditions accompanying ocular saccades cannot be mimicked with passive eyes. Ocular saccades are accompanied by peri-saccadic suppression during which, unlike with flashed stimuli, activity along the visual sensory pathway is significantly suppressed (<a href=\"#bib76\">Hamker et al., 2011</a>). Also, saccades are always ending with additional eye movements, such as overshoots, corrections and drifts, which are lacking in passive-eye experiments. In general, it seems that the conditions introduced when stimuli are flashed on passive sensors mimic a small set of naturally-occurring states such as lightning at night or a sudden wind blowing over the rat\u2019s whiskers. It is thus not surprising that, when compared, the characteristics of NRs revealed with passive sensors are substantially different from those revealed with active sensors (e.g., <a href=\"#bib91\">Kagan et al., 2002</a>)."

When this assumption was tested computationally at the presence of simulated eye movements it was found that such a retrieval is possible with a very simple environment (one stimulus) and a limited number of possible NRs (two), in which case the knowledge of the statistics of sensor motion (e.g., eye movements) can provide unique, unambiguous solutions (<a href=\"#bib140\">Pitkow et al., 2007</a>). However, it is not clear if a similar mechanism can work with more crowded environments, even when the movement trajectory of the eye is tracked by the perceiver (<a href=\"#bib28\">Burak et al., 2010</a>). The major challenge with IvR retrieval in OLP, even when the sensor trajectory is known\u00a0(e.g.,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib7\">Ahissar et al., 2015a</a>), is the instability of the sensory input. With spike-based representations and finite firing rates this instability is devastating \u2013 by the time required to construct a reliable representation the sensor may have already moved away and provide new inputs. With representations of fine visual details it had been shown that this is indeed the case (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ahissar and Arieli, 2012</a>)."

This difference can be attributed to the fact that while a passive eye that is stimulated by a flashed image can only use spatial coding to represent the image, a moving eye can use both spatial and temporal coding schemes. In fact, the temporal code appears to be much more accurate, and of higher spatial resolution, than the spatial code (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ahissar and Arieli, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Berry et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib153\">Reich et al., 1997</a>). Thus an OLP theory assuming that the same IvR is retrieved with or without sensor motion must also assume that perception is based on the less accurate spatially-coded information and ignores (or corrects for) the more accurate temporally-coded information - clearly an inefficient strategy. As we will see below (in <i>Contrasting OLP and CLP \u2013 discriminatory testable predictions</i>), a\u00a0more\u00a0efficient OLP scheme, which\u00a0is based on active sensing and can exploit its advantages, is also possible."

The same curvature can be generated when contacting objects at different locations, an ambiguity that is resolved if the angle by which the whisker is rotated is taken into account (<a href=\"#bib16\">Bagdasarian et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

As loop cycle times are typically shorter than the typical perceptual epoch (e.g., <a href=\"#bib44\">Deutsch et al., 2012</a>), a sequence of such sensory activations is typically expected within each perceptual epoch (i.e., a period of continuous engagement with the object). How would this sequence of activations be ignored? And, more importantly perhaps, why would it be ignored? Moreover, it is known that increased stimulus exposure durations increase perceptual accuracy and confidence (<a href=\"#bib138\">Packer and Williams, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib159\">Saig et al., 2012</a>); if this is achieved in an open-loop manner, then it would mean that the brain does use those additional sensory signals, and \u201ccorrects for\u201d the motion that evoked them using efference copy signals.

For example, projecting a flash of an image on the retina or skin, for a duration that is shorter than the duration of the minimal MSM-loop cycle, does not allow closure of the loop. When such a \u2018virtual knife\u2019 is used, the system is forced to function in an open-loop mode, regardless of its architecture. According to the OLP doctrine, this reductionist step does not interfere with the fundamental process underlying perception and thus the natural perceptual process can be reconstructed from such individual open-loop processes. However, backward masking, a robust perceptual phenomenon, challenges this assumption. The presentation of a second object within tens of milliseconds after the presentation of a target object prevents or impairs the perception of this target object (<a href=\"#bib53\">Enns and Di Lollo, 2000</a>). Such \u201cbackward in time\u201d effect can occur in some open loop scenarios, for example if perception would depend on the integration of two processes, one fast and one slow, such that the fast process activated by the mask would interfere with the slow process activated by the target (<a href=\"#bib25\">Breitmeyer and Ogmen, 2000</a>). Experimental data, however, were found to be inconsistent with such open loop schemes, while supporting a dependency of perception on closed loop (\u201cre-entrant\u201d) mechanisms, in which the stimulus is repetitively sampled (<a href=\"#bib53\">Enns and Di Lollo, 2000</a>). The dependency on repetitive sampling strongly challenges the assumption that the \u2018virtual knife\u2019 does not interfere with the natural process of perception. Backward masking indicates that flashed stimuli allow, at best, an examination of the first step of a perceptual process, as explained below (see <i>CLP propositions</i>)."

Converging dynamics, i.e., dynamics during which the state of the entire system gradually approaches a steady state, are hallmarks of closed-loops \u2013 an open-loop system does not converge as a whole. Thus, while the OLP doctrine could accept neuronal convergence in local circuits, it cannot account for perceptually-relevant MSM converging dynamics."

The first uses proprioceptive (re-afferent; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, green) signals to monitor sensor state. Such loops are always closed; that is, information about the sensor state is always conveyed back to the rest of the loop. Importantly, these loops can also sense external features in a rough way (<a href=\"#bib18\">Berryman et al., 2006</a>), probably via sensing significant deviations between intended and actual sensor kinematics. The other type uses sensory signals to directly monitor features of external objects (ex-afferent; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, magenta). The receptors of \u201cex-afferent loops\u201d, i.e., loops that contain ex-afferents, do not respond to sensor movement per-se, but to sensor interactions with external objects. These loops remain open if no object exists in the external field scanned by the sensor. They will be closed (i.e., meaningful neuronal activity will flow along the loop) only through interactions of the sensory organ with specific external features to which their receptors are responsive. For example, whisker contacts with external objects activate a family of vibrissal mechanoreceptors that otherwise would remain silent (\"Touch cells\") (<a href=\"#bib100\">Knutsen and Ahissar, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib169\">Szwed et al., 2003</a>) - the loops containing these neurons will be closed only through the interaction of whiskers with an external object present in the field of whisking (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Similarly, most photoreceptors are activated by luminance changes and thus would remain silent when the eye rotates against a uniform background. Visual ex-afferent MSM-loops are thus likely to be closed only via the existence of specific optical features in the visual field."

Internal models implement simulations of the interactions of the brain with the external world, simulations that are tightly coupled to the actual interactions. A continuous comparison of the predictions of internal models with the signals resulting from the actual interactions can provide a measure of the deviation of the actual convergence process from an expected one - the closer the actual and simulated processes the higher the confidence. If internal models are also continuously updated along with the developing history of the organism, as usually assumed, they can provide a close estimation of <i>C<sub>j</sub></i>. Internal models are often hypothesized to be implemented via\u00a0cerebro-cerebellar, basal-ganglia, or thalamo-cortical loops; in principle, internal models affiliated with different MSM-loops can be implemented via\u00a0different brain areas or circuits. Furthermore, the internal models are likely active players in the operation of the MSM-loop and its convergence dynamics, which is consistent with reports of neuronal signals that are involved in both perceptual processing and perceptual confidence (<a href=\"#bib55\">Fetsch et al., 2014</a>)."

An \u2018object\u2019 is a certain set of such features, proposed here to be a set that is delineated by a coordinated convergence process. As the dynamics of such multiple-loop convergence are beyond the scope of this article, we would only mention that they should depend on two major processes. One is a binding process in which the loops share information - one candidate vehicle for inter-loop binding is a link established by fast frequency oscillations (<a href=\"#bib59\">Fries et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib171\">Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand, 1999</a>), as they allow several inter-loop iterations per each motor-sensory-motor iteration. The second is a selection process (<a href=\"#bib86\">Humphries et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib149\">Prescott et al., 2006</a>) that determines the control over the sensory organ. This selection process is not unique to \u2018within object\u2019 loops \u2013 it should operate constantly, as naturally more than one MSM-loop is expected to be functional at any given time. We consider two, not mutually exclusive, major schemes of control selection. In one, every loop controls a sub-set of the muscle units attached to the sensory organ (e.g., <a href=\"#bib170\">Takatoh et al., 2013</a>). In the other, there is a dynamic selection of the MSM-loop(s) that control sensor-object interactions at any given moment. This process can be implemented by a variety of architectures, including subsumption-like (<a href=\"#bib26\">Brooks, 1986</a>), hierarchical curiosity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Gordon and Ahissar, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Gordon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Gordon et al., 2014</a>) and others (<a href=\"#bib12\">Arkin, 1998</a>).

For example, when looking at an object or a scene the eyes saccade through a sequence of fixation areas, following a trajectory that is often termed \u201cscanpath\u201d (<a href=\"#bib102\">Ko et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib133\">Noton and Stark, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib179\">Walker-Smith et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib185\">Yarbus, 1967</a>), and drift around within each fixation area for several hundreds of milliseconds (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ahissar et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib157\">Rucci et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib167\">Steinman and Levinson, 1990</a>). The scanpath trajectory, which moves the visual gaze from one region of interest to another, is considered in our scheme to be part of converging dynamics in one level of MSM-loops, and the local drift scanning trajectories, which acquire local visual details (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ennis et al., 2014</a>), are considered to be parts of converging dynamics of MSM-loops at lower levels (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ahissar et al., 2014</a>). Moving on from a given fixation area depends on the <i>C<sub>j</sub>s\u00a0</i>obtained at that area by the lower loops, on the perceptual dynamics of the scanpath loop, on variables of still higher loops depending on the context, task and brain state and on changes in the external object or scene."

Physical time is unlikely to have a neuronal metric, or \u2018yardstick,\u2019 enabling its direct measurement. In contrast, a yardstick that is available for each MSM-loop is its own cycle time, which can be sensed by each of its components. Durations of external events can be measured by the counts of such \u2018ticks\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahissar, 1998</a>). In this case, the resolution of perceptual time is the loop cycle time; events occurring within one cycle are considered simultaneous (<a href=\"#bib144\">Poppel, 2004</a>). A possible relationship between physical and perceptual times can be described using a helix metaphor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The helix should be considered flexible in its \u2018perceptual axis\u2019, being affected by the state of the perceiving loop. As changes in the loop\u2019s cycle time can also be sensed by neurons (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahissar, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ahissar and Vaadia, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Buonomano and Merzenich, 1995</a>), online calibration between perceptual and physical time is possible to some extent. The assessment of physical time by an MSM-loop is predicted here to depend on the loop cycle time, which of course can change according to the perceptual scenario."

This platform allows the implementation of minimal MSM-loops based models (one motor DOF and one sensor). The SYCLOP uses a biomimetic camera (DVS128, iniLabs Ltd Zurich, Switzerland, <a href=\"#bib112\">Lichtsteiner et al., 2008</a>) as its sensor; this camera, like a retina, sends signals only upon luminance intensity changes.

The value of \u03c9 was then sent by the program to the pan-tilt controller and modified the camera\u2019s pan velocity. This implementation illustrates a simple CLP convergence process (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and shows how different precepts can be differentiated in CLP. The convergence dynamics involves different dynamics of the sensory (r<sub>on</sub> and r<sub>off</sub>), neuronal (<math id=\"inf11\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and motor (<math id=\"inf12\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi>\u03c9</mi></mrow></mstyle></math>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) variables. Yet, the variables are strongly linked, as demonstrated by the phase diagram of the neuronal and motor variables (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>); these two variables quickly converge to a limit cycle (i.e., a constant closed trajectory in the phase plane). Similar behavior is observed in the other phase planes (sensory-motor and sensory-neuronal, not shown). Importantly, in all these phase planes the limit cycle depends on the external contrast (\u03b3); while maintaining all loop parameters constant, a monotonic change in \u03b3 results in a corresponding monotonic change of the limit cycle (green and red trajectories in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> for contrasts of 0.5 and 0.9, respectively). Hence, the image\u2019s contrast can be inferred from the asymptotic behavior of the system or, in other words, the motor-sensory-neuronal trajectory that is uniquely associated with (or, equivalently, the CLP\u2019s IvR of) a given contrast can be \u201cretrieved\u201d by the presentation of that contrast to the perceiver."

Such objects become virtual components of the relevant loops, hardly distinguishable, as long as they are perceived, from other components of the loop such as muscles, receptors and neurons. What primarily distinguishes external objects from body parts are inclusion duration and state; short and transient inclusions mark external objects while long and steady inclusions mark body parts (see also <a href=\"#bib173\">Uexkull, 1926</a>). Interestingly, the perceptual dynamics suggested by this hypothesis reconciles a conflict between objective scientific observations and the subjective everyday experience of perceiving objects with no mediation (see also <i>A philosophical angle</i> below). Everyday perception of a given external object, CLP suggests, is the dynamic process of inclusion of its features in MSM-loops. This process starts with a perturbation, internal or external, and gradually converges towards a complete inclusion - approaching, although never reaching, a state of \u201cdirect\u201d perception. A laboratory-induced flashed stimulus, according to this model, probes the initiation of a perceptual process, whereas dreaming and imagining evoke internal components of the process."

We consider here two major OLP classes: in one, sensory OLP (sOLP), the movement of the sensory organ is not an essential component of perception, and in the other, motor-sensory OLP (msOLP), it is (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). sOLP thus assumes that IvRs are confined to the brain (i.e., they are specific NRs) and can be fully retrieved by sensory activations alone when the sensor is passive. msOLP, in contrast, postulates that IvRs are not confined to the brain, and can form the basis for perception only if they\u00a0include\u00a0the relevant MS-contingencies (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). According to msOLP, IvRs cannot be retrieved with passive sensory organs. Importantly, however, msOLP does not assume a motor-sensory-motor loop; that is, its scheme includes a motor-to-sensory arc but not a sensory-to-motor arc (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Hence, with msOLP, movements of the sensory organ are predetermined for each perceptual epoch and are not affected by the ongoing sensory input during that epoch. In contrast to the OLP hypotheses, using the same representational terminology, CLP postulates that IvRs can form the basis for perception only if they contain the dynamics and state of the entire MSM-loop including the relevant features of the object (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Thus, the minimal set of variables that must be included in the IvR of each object, or feature, is different for each hypothesis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, bluish ellipses): internal-only sensory variables in sOLP, internal sensory variables and MS-contingencies in msOLP and the entire perceiving loop in CLP."

Note that the paralysis must include the relevant sensory organ and the object must be entirely stationary. In the case of touch it should be evident that while contacts may be detectable, no object perception is possible with paralyzed hands \u2013 we are not aware of any study contradicting this conjecture. In contrast, our intuition regarding hearing is that action is not a fundamental requirement for hearing. Yet,\u00a0two important points are relevant here. First, our intuition may be misled by the fact that we cannot be aware of motor activation of the outer hair cells and the muscles of the middle ear \u2013 we are not aware of perceptual experiments in which these activations were blocked, or measured. Second, no stationary object exists in audition. Acoustic waves are always dynamic and always activate the inner hair cells.

This adaptation clearly indicates the need in active sensation for visual perception, at least in that patient. Natural employment of active vision is indicated by the \"weird, confusing and indescribable\" forms of perceptions reported during acute partial paralysis of the ocular muscles (<a href=\"#bib168\">Stevens et al., 1976</a>).

For example, asking humans to scan a scene according to verbal instructions or by pursuing a target, or moving the sensory organ according to a trajectory that was recorded in a previous active session. (ii) Allowing active touch but with the motion of one hand determining the sensory flow to the other hand. (iii) Perturbing neuronal specific sensory-to-motor pathways, such as those connecting the sensory cortex to the motor cortex (<a href=\"#bib35\">Colechio and Alloway, 2009</a>), those connecting sensory cortex to motor nuclei (typically via layer 5B neurons), or those connecting the thalamus to motor (cortical and sub-cortical) stations (<a href=\"#bib165\">Smith et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The exact design should depend on available genetic markers and the testing of these predictions should be conducted in a balanced way, using appropriate sham perturbations. The following observations are predicted by CLP but not by sOLP or msOLP during natural perception: (iv) The motion trajectories of the sensory organ will differ for different object features (expected from affective sensory-to-motor connections). (v) The motion of the sensory organ will depend on the concurrent sensory input; for example, when a rat perceives an object\u2019s shape or texture, the movement trajectory of its whiskers will depend on the sequence of curvatures and stick-slip events preceding it within the same perceptual epoch. Similarly, the motion trajectory of the eye will depend on the retinal activations preceding it within the same perceptual epoch."

(ii) Convergence will be to different steady-state patterns while perceiving different features or values. (iii) Specific steady-state patterns will be associated with specific perceptual reports. (iv) Convergence dynamics can predict perceptual report timing and/or error. (v) A virtual object can be perceived when sensory neuronal activity is manipulated to mimic the activity expected by the movement of the sensory organ and the presence of a real object (<a href=\"#bib134\">O'Connor et al., 2013</a>); with reliable mimicry a convergence process should follow. (vi) CLP predicts that the lag between the actual and perceived times of an external transition (\u201cperceptual lag\u201d) should decrease along the process of perceptual convergence, when in steady-state no lag is expected. It has been previously shown that perceptual lags of the onset of transient stimuli are longer than those of continuously-present ones (<a href=\"#bib131\">Nijhawan, 2001</a>). CLP thus predicts that with similar experimental protocols (e.g., a rotating arm is shown continuously and a dot is transiently displayed (flashed) for various durations at various positions traversed by the rotating arm), when looking at the offset of the transient stimulus rather than its onset, the temporal perceptual lag of the offset will decrease with increasing transient durations. (vii) With a motion-induced-blindness (MIB) protocol, in which stationary targets are surrounded by moving background dots, the targets \u2018disappear\u2019 occasionally (<a href=\"#bib22\">Bonneh et al., 2001</a>). In one possible implementation of CLP the visual system would control the velocity of retinal image slip, and maintain it within a certain working range, instead of directly controlling drift velocity. This would be achieved by modifying drift speed in a manner that is inversely proportional to the speed of the retinal slip. When the retinal slip is dominated by external motion, such as in MIB, eye drift speed would be reduced significantly. When the drift speed will be reduced below a certain level, retinal receptors at corresponding eccentricities may not receive sufficient luminance changes to be activated by the stationary parts of the image. Thus, in MIB conditions in which the drift speed is inversely correlated with the dots\u2019 speed, target disappearance is expected to be preceded by a reduction of the drift speed below a certain threshold; threshold level should depend on the eccentricity of the disappearing target."

Practically, as the scientific method enforces reductionist steps, it is important to notice what reductions are allowed, as behavioral predictions of CLP or msOLP, regarding natural perception, cannot be tested in paradigms in which their basic assumptions are \u201creduced out.\u201d Clearly, if eye or whisker motion is prevented, critical predictions of CLP or msOLP cannot be tested. Experiments in which eye or whisker motion is allowed but head motion is restrained have a limited discriminative power - conclusions in these cases should take into account the possibility that head-restrained animals develop unique compensatory active strategies which may not be indicative for the head-free condition. When MSM-loops are not given enough time to converge, as is the case with passive sensing (e.g., visual flashes) for example, discrimination between CLP and OLP is usually not possible (as both predict partial perception, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

What feels direct and immediate to every human perceiver appears indirect and mediated when physical constrains are taken into account (<a href=\"#bib37\">Crane, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Kelso, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib145\">Port and Van Gelder, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib174\">Ullman, 1980</a>). Our CLP hypothesis proposes a reconciliation of objective scientific observations and subjective everyday experience via closed-loop dynamics between the perceiver and the perceived. Such closed-loops converge gradually to a state in which the perceiver and the perceived are inseparable. The idea is that, although the loops never actually reach an ideal steady-state, they get closer and closer to these states during a perceptual epoch and typically quit the convergence process when the distance from a steady state is barely sensible. Being close enough to the steady state can give rise to the feeling of direct and immediate perception."

One would think that most rational neuroscientists would agree. Yet much of mammalian systems neuroscience went through a dark period of working with primarily anesthetized animals or highly constrained animals. This was particularly egregious in vision, where one could argue that a generation of neuroscientists attended to second-order effects to Hubel and Wiesel receptive fields while a basic role of visual areas for motion control went undiscovered until a few years back; see, e.g., Carandini (Nat Neurosci 2013), Bonhoeffer (Neuron 2012), and Stryker (Neuron 2010). The current work reviews this dark period, although the authors should note that some areas, including the study of the VOR and the OKR, the study of hippocampal function during learning and memory (2015 Nobel prize), and clearly the study of motor control for locomotion and manipulation, did not fall into this trap. The pioneering gating experiments of Chapin and Woodward (Exp Neurol 1982), which show how motor output gates sensation, deserve special mention as counterpoint to the authors' sarcasm, i.e., \"The (re) discovery that mammalian sensation is active\u2026\"."

Thus, unless the animal acts on the information, one does not know if the representation, presumably the pattern of neurons spiking in different brain areas, is a complete or only a partial representation. Further, the partial representation could be too incomplete for action to occur. I think we all would agree. Many highly cited studies on internal representation view a change in motor output in response to a change in internal representation \u2013 which could be the act of pushing a lever to declare a sensorimotor process is terminating- as a gold standard. There is a fair literature on this \u2013 including the pioneering ICMS experiments of Newsome and colleagues (Nature 1990, J Neurophysiol 1992, Neuron 2014). In the vibrissa literature, which appears prominently in this manuscript, there are the reafferent coding studies of Kleinfeld and colleagues (J Neurophysiol 1997; Neuron 2011). The authors go through many arguments to describe why the notion of a motor-free, or open loop representation, will fail. A key argument involves the time it takes \u2013 presumably cycles of recurrence \u2013 to form an internal representation. This is reminiscent of the argument by Martin (TiNS 1988) on the formation of visual representation as a recurrent of feedback, which was written as a challenge to the feed forward processing implicit in the wiring maps of Feldman and Van Essen."

Yet much of mammalian systems neuroscience went through a dark period of working with primarily anesthetized animals or highly constrained animals. This was particularly egregious in vision, where one could argue that a generation of neuroscientists attended to second-order effects to Hubel and Wiesel receptive fields while a basic role of visual areas for motion control went undiscovered until a few years back; see, e.g., Carandini (Nat Neurosci 2013), Bonhoeffer (Neuron 2012), and Stryker (Neuron 2010). The current work reviews this dark period, although the authors should note that some areas, including the study of the VOR and the OKR, the study of hippocampal function during learning and memory (2015 Nobel prize), and clearly the study of motor control for locomotion and manipulation, did not fall into this trap.

Thus, unless the animal acts on the information, one does not know if the representation, presumably the pattern of neurons spiking in different brain areas, is a complete or only a partial representation. Further, the partial representation could be too incomplete for action to occur. I think we all would agree. Many highly cited studies on internal representation view a change in motor output in response to a change in internal representation \u2013 which could be the act of pushing a lever to declare a sensorimotor process is terminating- as a gold standard. There is a fair literature on this \u2013 including the pioneering ICMS experiments of Newsome and colleagues (Nature 1990, J Neurophysiol 1992, Neuron 2014). In the vibrissa literature, which appears prominently in this manuscript, there are the reafferent coding studies of Kleinfeld and colleagues (J Neurophysiol 1997; Neuron 2011). The authors go through many arguments to describe why the notion of a motor-free, or open loop representation, will fail. A key argument involves the time it takes \u2013 presumably cycles of recurrence \u2013 to form an internal representation. This is reminiscent of the argument by Martin (TiNS 1988) on the formation of visual representation as a recurrent of feedback, which was written as a challenge to the feed forward processing implicit in the wiring maps of Feldman and Van Essen.</i>"

Thus, many people imagine a kind of a loop that combines visual sensation with arm movement, for example, closing the loop via visual sensation of the arm. This is of course not what we refer to in this paper \u2013 we refer to loops that include only one sensory organ, control its movement and sense its signals. We try to emphasize the flow of the loop signals from and to the same sensory organ by using the term motor-sensory-motor loop.
