                    "text": "T cell self-tolerance is thought to involve peripheral tolerance and negative selection, involving apoptosis of autoreactive thymocytes. However, evidence supporting an essential role for negative selection is limited. Loss of Bim, a Bcl-2 BH3-only protein essential for thymocyte apoptosis, rarely results in autoimmunity on the C57BL/6 background. Mice with T cell-specific over-expression of Bcl-2, that blocks multiple BH3-only proteins, are also largely normal. The nuclear receptor Nur77, also implicated in negative selection, might function redundantly to promote apoptosis by associating with Bcl-2 and exposing its potentially pro-apoptotic BH3 domain. Here, we report that T cell-specific expression of a <i>Bcl2</i> BH3 mutant transgene results in enhanced rescue of thymocytes from negative selection. Concomitantly, T<sub>reg</sub> development is increased. However, aged BH3 mutant mice progressively accumulate activated, autoreactive T cells, culminating in development of multi-organ autoimmunity and lethality. These data provide strong evidence that negative selection is crucial for establishing T cell tolerance."

These data provide strong evidence that negative selection is crucial for establishing T cell tolerance."

A series of mechanisms are thought to be involved in establishing T cell tolerance, the first of which is deletion of potentially self-reactive T cells in the thymus. During T cell development, autoreactive T cells bind self-peptide presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules with high affinity and receive strong T cell receptor (TCR) signals that trigger apoptosis and clonal deletion. Some of these cells can also differentiate down an alternative pathway to a harmless lineage, such as T regulatory cells (T<sub>reg</sub>), or also CD8\u03b1\u03b1 and invariant NK T cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Stritesky et al., 2012</a>). The importance of this process, termed negative selection, in establishing self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity was best demonstrated in studies of mice deficient in the autoimmune regulator (<i>Aire</i>) gene. These mice develop a multi-organ autoimmune disease as the result of defective deletion of auto-reactive T cells specific to tissue-restricted antigens (TRA), which would normally be expressed by medullary thymic epithelial cells under the control of AIRE (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 2002</a>). Humans with loss of AIRE function develop similar disease pathology (<a href=\"#bib15\">Finnish-German APECED Consortium., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Nagamine et al., 1997</a>). However, additional models that implicate a breakdown in negative selection as the driving force behind the development of autoimmune disease are lacking (<a href=\"#bib45\">von Boehmer and Melchers, 2010</a>). This might suggest that under most circumstances, subsequent tolerizing mechanisms in the peripheral compartments such as anergy or T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated suppression are sufficient to compensate for defective thymic deletion. Even in the case of AIRE-deficiency, impaired tolerization of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the periphery by extra-thymic AIRE expressing cells likely contributes to the development of autoimmunity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gardner et al., 2013</a>). This has cast doubt on the relative importance of negative selection for maintaining immunological self-tolerance."

                        "text": "Apoptosis of thymocytes during negative selection is dependent on the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tischner et al., 2010</a>). In particular, the pro-apoptotic, Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) only protein, Bim, which is upregulated in response to strong TCR signals, is essential for this process. Bim and other BH3-only proteins are thought to promote apoptosis by binding and inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (such as Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> and Mcl-1) that directly suppress downstream effectors Bax and Bak, which are responsible for disrupting mitochondrial membrane integrity (<a href=\"#bib49\">Youle and Strasser, 2008</a>). Bim-deficiency has been shown to cause defective thymocyte apoptosis in several TCR transgenic (HY, OTI, OTII) models of negative selection (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bouillet et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Moran et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Suen and Baldwin, 2012</a>). However, this apoptotic defect does not lead to emergence of autoreactive mature T cells except in the case of negative selection to TRA (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kovalovsky et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Suen and Baldwin, 2012</a>). Interestingly, <i>Bim</i><sup><i>\u2212</i>/<i>\u2212</i></sup> mice on a mixed 129/Sv X C57BL/6 background develop a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like autoimmune disease, indicative of a breakdown in tolerance (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouillet et al., 1999</a>). However, loss of Bim in other immune compartments likely contributes to the disease, especially B cells, which are important mediators of SLE pathology. This phenotype was greatly ameliorated on the autoimmune-resistant C57BL/6 background and is distinct from the multi-organ, T cell dominant disease found in AIRE-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bouillet et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Labi et al., 2014</a>). Recently, a study showed that additional loss of Puma (<i>Bbc3</i>), another BH3-only protein, enhanced the <i>Bim</i><sup><i>\u2212</i>/<i>\u2212</i></sup> thymic deletion defect and led to the development of immune pathology more similar to that found in AIRE-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gray et al., 2012</a>). T cells from these mice were able to transfer the disease, lending support to it being T cell-driven. However, the role of non-T cells in these mice cannot be excluded due to germline deletion of Puma and Bim. In addition, T-cell specific over-expression of Bcl-2, which can inhibit both Bim and Puma (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2005</a>), does not lead to autoimmunity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sentman et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Linette et al., 1995</a>), suggesting that a defect in T cells alone may be insufficient to cause disease. Alternatively, redundant negative selection pathways involving Bim, Puma and the Nur77 family members (See below) may not allow Bcl-2 over-expression to block all pathways leading to negative selection."

                        "text": "In addition to Bim, the Nur77 family of orphan steroid receptors, which includes Nur77, Nor-1 and Nurr1, has also been implicated in apoptosis accompanying negative selection. Nur77 expression, like that of Bim, is induced by strong TCR signals that result in negative selection. Low expression of both proteins has been correlated with defective clonal deletion in Non-obese Diabetic (NOD) mice (<a href=\"#bib37\">Sohn et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Liston et al., 2004</a>). Furthermore, T cell-specific over-expression of Nur77, or Nor-1, results in massive apoptosis of thymocytes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cheng et al., 1997b</a>). Expression of a dominant negative Nur77 protein that can block all family members results in inhibition of apoptosis in the F5 and HY TCR transgenic models of negative selection (<a href=\"#bib7\">Calnan et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Zhou et al., 1996</a>). Deficiency in Nur77 alone (<i>Nr4a1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup>) results in moderate inhibition of apoptosis accompanying negative selection in the OTII and BDC2.5 TCR transgenic models (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fassett et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, the Nur77 family has also been shown to transcriptionally regulate <i>Foxp3</i> expression and deletion of all three Nur77 family members (<i>Nr4a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> <i>X</i> Cd4<i>-Cre</i><sup><i>+</i></sup><i>Nr4a1</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup><i>Nr4a2</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup>) results in impaired T<sub>reg</sub> cell production and development of a quick onset, severe autoimmune disease resembling that of Foxp3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sekiya et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, Nur77 could contribute to the maintenance of immunological tolerance both by facilitating deletion of autoreactive thymocytes and ensuring production of T<sub>reg</sub> cells. The mechanism by which Nur77 and its family members promote thymocyte apoptosis has long been under investigation. We and others showed that strong TCR signals induce the translocation of Nur77 and Nor-1 from the nucleus to the mitochondria in thymocytes, a phenomenon first reported to occur in cancer cells in response to apoptotic stimuli (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Thompson and Winoto, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). At the mitochondria, Nur77 and Nor-1 bind Bcl-2 and cause exposure of Bcl-2's BH3 domain, the \u2018death\u2019 domain of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Bcl-2 BH3 exposure correlates with thymocyte apoptosis in TCR-stimulated thymocytes and HY and F5 TCR transgenic thymocytes undergoing negative selection (<a href=\"#bib43\">Thompson and Winoto, 2008</a>). BH3-exposed Bcl-2 might act similarly to BH3-only protein Bim to bind and inhibit other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, such as Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, as was demonstrated in cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kolluri et al., 2008</a>). It is thus possible that Nur77 converts Bcl-2 to a pro-apoptotic effector during negative selection, preventing over-expression of Bcl-2 from completely blocking negative selection."

We found that over-expression of both wild-type and BH3 mutant Bcl-2 efficiently rescued thymocyte apoptosis in two TCR transgenic models of negative selection. However, the BH3 mutant transgene more effectively blocked TCR-induced thymocyte apoptosis in vitro and better rescued high affinity TCR clones from deletion in polyclonal systems in vivo. Interestingly, BH3 mutant transgenic mice, in contrast to the reported wild-type <i>Bcl2</i> transgenic mouse phenotype, developed multi-organ autoimmune pathology and died around one year-of-age. Thus, we provide strong evidence that a breakdown in thymocyte apoptosis during negative selection is indeed sufficient to cause autoimmune disease."

Although the transgene is expressed by the <i>Cd4</i> promoter, increased Bcl-2 expression was detected in DN (CD4<sup>\u2212</sup> CD8<sup>\u2212</sup> double negative) thymocytes as early as CD25<sup>+</sup> CD44<sup>\u2212</sup> DN3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This was very similar to the expression pattern of the <i>Lck</i>-driven wild-type <i>Bcl2</i> transgene. Additionally, the level of Bcl-2 upregulation in BH3 Tg vs Bcl-2 Tg thymocytes was very similar in DN, DP and CD4 single positive (CD4 SP) thymocytes. Only slightly higher expression of the BH3 transgene was noted in DP and CD4 SP cells. As expected, BH3 transgene expression was downregulated in CD8 single positive (CD8 SP) thymocytes due to loss of CD4 expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Lymph node CD8 T cells further downregulated BH3 transgene expression, while both BH3 Tg and Bcl-2 Tg CD4 T cells maintained similarly high levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Interestingly, we observed a compensatory downregulation of endogenous mouse Bcl-2 in the thymus, lymph nodes and spleen of both BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Thus, we do not have to consider a contribution of endogenous mouse Bcl-2 to the phenotype of these mice. Due to close similarity in transgene expression level and pattern in the two BH3 Tg lines, BH3 A and BH3 B, we used these mice interchangeably throughout our study (Data not shown). In both BH3 Tg lines, we observed a decreased proportion of DP thymocytes and an increased proportion of SP thymocytes compared to wild-type littermate controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). However, only the absolute SP cell numbers were increased, especially for CD4 SP cells, while the DP cell number was comparable to wild-type controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This is largely similar to the thymocyte distribution found in the wild-type Bcl-2 Tg mice (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sentman et al., 1991</a>). As expected, the peripheral mature T cell compartment reflects the increased SP thymocyte numbers in both the BH3 Tg and Bcl-2 Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Relative to wild-type mice, the CD4 to CD8 T cell ratio is therefore somewhat skewed in favor of CD4 T cells in the BH3 Tg mice and CD8 T cells in the Bcl-2 Tg mice. Hence, differential expression in the CD8 compartment is one caveat to comparison of BH3 and Bcl-2 transgenic mice. However, similar expression levels in the CD4 compartment should allow fair comparison of DP, CD4 SP and CD4 T cell phenotypes."

We also examined Bcl-2/F5 mice for comparison. In response to injection with the F5 TCR-specific peptide, NP, F5 DP thymocytes undergo massive apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mamalaki et al., 1992</a>). Strikingly, however, expression of either the BH3 or <i>Bcl2</i> transgene almost completely inhibited thymocyte death, with thymocyte numbers only marginally decreased compared to PBS-injected control mice after 48 hr of treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Analysis of thymocyte proportions indicated a significant rescue of the DP thymocyte population (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We sought to increase the sensitivity of the assay by using a previously described ex vivo thymic slice approach (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dzhagalov et al., 2013</a>). This assay allows assessment of apoptosis over a more acute timeline, free of possible cytotoxic effects inherent in the NP injection model (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mamalaki et al., 1992</a>). In this assay, transgenic thymic lobes were embedded in agarose, cut into 500 \u03bcm slices by vibratome and cultured in transwells. The slices were then briefly exposed to the relevant or an irrelevant control peptide and thymocyte apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry at 12-hr intervals. Here, again, we saw near complete and equivalent protection of BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg thymocytes from apoptosis in response to NP peptide treatment over a 36-hr time course (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Thymocytes of all genotypes were similarly activated as measured by upregulation of CD69 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We also performed an analogous thymic slice assay comparing apoptosis of thymocytes from female BH3 or Bcl-2 Tg mice crossed to HY TCR transgenic mice (BH3/HY or Bcl-2/HY, respectively) in response to the HY TCR-specific peptide, Smcy. Remarkably, just as in the F5 model, thymocytes expressing either transgene were significantly protected from apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Hence, we conclude that Bcl-2 over-expression very efficiently inhibits thymocyte apoptosis accompanying negative selection in these models and this potent blockade could not be enhanced by expression of a BH3 mutant form of Bcl-2."

To investigate this, we employed the Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> BAC transgenic reporter mouse system, in which GFP is inserted into the start site of the <i>Nr4a1</i> (Nur77) transgene (<a href=\"#bib30\">Moran et al., 2011</a>). Studies of these mice have clearly demonstrated that the level of Nur77 expression in T cells directly correlates with the intensity of the TCR signals received (<a href=\"#bib30\">Moran et al., 2011</a>). During thymocyte selection, cells receiving strong TCR signals are destined to die by negative selection while cells receiving very weak to no signal die by neglect. Hence, the post-selection thymocyte pool is largely comprised of cells expressing an intermediate level of GFP, reflecting their receipt of moderate, positively selecting TCR signals. In <i>Bim</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> X Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice, however, a significant number of post-selection thymocytes express high levels of GFP, indicating that high affinity TCR clones are rescued from negative selection in the absence of Bim (<a href=\"#bib40\">Stritesky et al., 2013</a>). This rescue was also reflected by an increase in the total number of post-selection DP and SP thymocytes. When we assessed GFP expression of post-selection thymocytes in BH3/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> and Bcl-2/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice, we observed a strikingly similar phenotype. A large population of GFP-high post-selection DP thymocytes was rescued with the expression of either transgene (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). As in <i>Bim</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup>/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice, the proportion of post-selection DP thymocytes was consequently increased compared to wild-type mice, reflecting the rescue of these cells from deletion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

                                "text": "To quantify this effect, we defined GFP-high (GFPhi) cells as those expressing GFP at a level greater than the mean fluorescence intensity (M.F.I.) of wild-type post-selection DP cells; this definition allowed for the most consistent gating across independent experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The percent increase in GFPhi cells over wild-type is indicative of the proportion of cells rescued from negative selection by transgene expression. Interestingly, a significantly greater increase in the percentage of GFPhi post-selection DP cells was observed in BH3/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> vs Bcl-2/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice, suggesting that the BH3 transgene might indeed have an enhanced ability over wild-type <i>Bcl2</i> to rescue high affinity TCR clones from apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). No increase was observed in GFP-intermediate (GFPint) cells, indicating that the GFPhi population encompasses all rescued cells and that BH3 and <i>Bcl2</i> transgene expression, similar to Bim-deficiency, only rescues high affinity clones and therefore does not seem to enhance positive selection (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Stritesky et al., 2013</a>). BH3 and <i>Bcl2</i> transgene expression also rescued GFPhi CD4 and CD8 SP thymocytes from apoptosis. This likely indicates rescue of high affinity clones from deletion in response to self-antigens presented in the medulla and possibly rescue of DP cells that have differentiated into SP thymocytes. Confirming what has been shown in Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib30\">Moran et al., 2011</a>), GFP expression in BH3 and Bcl-2 Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> double transgenic mice was also TCR-dependent, as BH3/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> and Bcl-2/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> SP thymocytes removed from MHC in culture down-regulated GFP similarly to WT/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A greater percentage of GFPhi CD4 SP cells were rescued in BH3 Tg vs Bcl-2 Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Consistent with the BH3 transgene being downregulated in CD8 SP cells, BH3 expression rescued a smaller percentage of GFPhi CD8 SP thymocytes compared to CD4 SP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D vs 3C</a>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Bcl-2 over-expression causes a significant defect in thymocyte negative selection even in a normal, polyclonal system and in this context, the BH3 mutant protein rescues significantly more cells from death than wild-type Bcl-2."

Whether Bcl-2 over-expression can inhibit negative selection against endogenous superantigens is controversial. In one study, <i>Bcl2</i> transgene expression did not block superantigen negative selection (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sentman et al., 1991</a>) while another group clearly saw a rescue (<a href=\"#bib36\">Siegel et al., 1992</a>). Yet another study reported that cells were rescued from superantigen-mediated deletion in the <i>Bcl2</i> transgenic thymus, but not in the transgenic lymph nodes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Strasser et al., 1991</a>). To assess endogenous superantigen negative selection in BH3 Tg mice, we crossed them to the class II MHC I-E expressing CBA/J strain of mice. CBA/J mice express superantigens that delete T cells expressing V\u03b23, 5, 6, 7, 8.1, 9 and 11, but not V\u03b28.2 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Scherer et al., 1993</a>). We examined the proportions of V\u03b25, V\u03b26, V\u03b28.1/8.2 and V\u03b211 expressing DP and SP thymocytes in BH3 Tg X CBA/J mice and their wild-type littermate controls as well as in Bcl-2 Tg X CBA/J mice. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, the proportions of V\u03b25, V\u03b26 and V\u03b211, but not V\u03b28.1/8.2, expressing cells decreased between the DP and SP stage in non-transgenic mice, indicative of superantigen negative selection. In both BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice, however, increased proportions of V\u03b25, V\u03b26 and V\u03b211 expressing SP thymocytes were observed, suggesting that expression of either transgene can block superantigen-mediated deletion. The BH3 transgene rescued CD8 SP thymocytes less efficiently than the wild-type <i>Bcl2</i> transgene, reflective of the relative levels of transgenic protein in the CD8 compartment. CD4 SP thymocytes were rescued to a similar extent by both transgenes, however modestly better by the BH3 transgene for V\u03b25<sup>+</sup> and V\u03b26<sup>+</sup> cells. Interestingly, we observed a significant increase in V\u03b25<sup>+</sup> and V\u03b26<sup>+</sup> (but not V\u03b211<sup>+</sup>) DP thymocytes in the BH3 Tg mice that was not seen in the Bcl-2 Tg mice. The pattern of rescue in this model parallels that observed in the Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> polyclonal system. Together, these data are consistent with the notion that overexpression of both wild type and BH3 mutant <i>Bcl2</i> transgenes leads to an enhanced rescue of thymocytes from negative selection, with the BH3 mutant providing a more complete rescue."

                                "text": "Our results demonstrate that T cell-specific over-expression of wild-type Bcl-2 clearly results in a rescue of cells receiving strong TCR signals, which would normally undergo apoptosis, yet aged Bcl-2 Tg mice were not reported to develop autoimmune pathology (<a href=\"#bib24\">Linette et al., 1995</a>). Hence, we sought to investigate the fate of the rescued, high affinity T cell clones in the Bcl-2 Tg and BH3 Tg mice. We observed that the GFP mean fluorescence intensity was higher in lymph node T cells from both BH3/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> and Bcl-2/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). GFP expression was also dependent on TCR signaling, as removal of BH3/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> and Bcl-2/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mature T cells from MHC in culture resulted in downregulation of GFP at a rate similar to that observed for WT/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Hence, the increased GFP expression might be leftover from strong TCR signals received in the thymus and/or due to tonic TCR stimulation in the periphery. Interestingly, GFP levels were higher in Bcl-2 Tg vs BH3 Tg T cells, even for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The reason for this is unclear, but it may be due to distinct T cell repertoires in these two lines of mice that lead to differences in T cell signaling in the periphery. T<sub>reg</sub> cells have self-reactive TCRs and express a high level of GFP, however T<sub>reg</sub> cells did not account for the majority of the GFP-high CD4 T cells (data not shown). This indicates that conventional T cells with higher than normal TCR affinity are permitted to migrate into the periphery. Since presumably autoreactive T cells are found in the periphery, mechanisms must exist to keep these cells in check. One mechanism might be the production of more T<sub>reg</sub> cells to mediate suppression of the autoreactive cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Stritesky et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, we observed that GFP-high CD4 SP thymocytes rescued from negative selection express GFP at a very similar level to T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Since high TCR affinity contributes to T<sub>reg</sub> development (<a href=\"#bib39\">Stritesky et al., 2012</a>), we hypothesized that more thymocytes might be directed down this pathway in BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice. Indeed, we found greater Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cell proportions and numbers in the both the thymus and lymph nodes of BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). BH3 Tg mice had a more significant increase in peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> numbers compared to Bcl-2 Tg mice (3-fold vs 2-fold), mirroring the higher mature CD4 T cell numbers in these mice. Most of the increase in total T<sub>reg</sub> number was caused by an increase in CD25<sup>\u2212</sup>, and not CD25<sup>+</sup> cells. CD25<sup>\u2212</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells are thought to be derived from diverted, potentially autoreactive thymocytes and are functional, but have reduced suppressive capacity compared to CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zhan et al., 2011</a>). Despite the increase in total T<sub>reg</sub> number in BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice, the ratio of CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells to total CD4 T cells was similar to wild-type mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, some of the rescued high affinity clones appear to be diverted down the CD25<sup>\u2212</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> pathway, but not the CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> pathway. Intriguingly, consistent with this, we observed that CD25<sup>\u2212</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells express higher levels of GFP than CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells, at a similar level to the highest GFP-expressing BH3 Tg clones (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Another mechanism employed to maintain peripheral tolerance is the induction of T cell anergy upon antigen encounter. In addition to increased T<sub>reg</sub> cells, we also observed a higher proportion of previously activated, anergic CD4 T cells in BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice marked by upregulation of the markers FR4 and CD73 in CD44hi T cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Martinez et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, increased diversion to the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage/T<sub>reg</sub> suppression and CD4 T cell anergy might cooperate to suppress the emergence of autoimmunity in these mice."

                                "text": "CD4 and CD8 T cells in aged BH3 Tg mice were highly activated, as indicated by increased CD44 expression and decreased CD62L expression, reminiscent of the phenotype of the disease-promoting T cells in AIRE-deficient mice [<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>; (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 2002</a>)]. We also observed a significant increase in CD44hi/CD62Lhi central memory CD8 T cells. An increase in activated T cells was also sometimes observed in Bcl-2 Tg mice, but the phenotype was greatly attenuated. While we did not observe an increase in activated T cells in young mice (data not shown), starting as early as 20 weeks-of-age, there was significant accumulation of activated T cells in the peripheral blood of BH3 Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This increase became very dramatic and nearly ubiquitous in 40 to 50-week-old mice. In comparison, only a couple Bcl-2 Tg mice at 40 to 50 weeks were found to have increased activated T cells. To directly test the possible autoreactivity of BH3 Tg T cells, we stimulated T cells with syngeneic or allogeneic irradiated splenocytes and measured T cell proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). All T cells were able to proliferate in response to allogeneic stimulators, although CD4 T cells proliferated less than CD8 T cells and the presence of Bcl-2 further reduced proliferation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). This datum is consistent with the known inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 on cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#bib25\">Linette et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cheng et al., 2004</a>). When presented with syngeneic stimulators, little proliferation was observed for all the Tg and wild-type CD4 T cells, even with T<sub>reg</sub> depletion, most likely due to a combination of the lackluster ability of CD4 T cells to proliferate in this system and the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 on cell cycle progression. In contrast, CD8<sup>+</sup> BH3 Tg T cells exhibited significant proliferation in response to syngeneic stimulators, suggesting that the BH3 Tg mice contain autoreactive T cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Despite our inability to detect autoreactive CD4 T cells in BH3 Tg mice by MLR, we found that the activated CD4 T cells in aged mice appear to have increased effector function, as splenic CD4 T cells from 50-week-old mice secrete increased amounts of IFN\u03b3 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Only IFN\u03b3 and not IL-17 or IL-4 was increased, suggesting that the activated T cells are Th1 polarized (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Autoimmunity manifested as significant infiltration of lymphocytes into the liver, lung and kidney of BH3, but not Bcl-2 Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). In addition, autoantibodies against multiple non-lymphoid tissues (pancreas, eye, lung, liver, kidney, stomach) were detected by immunoblot of whole tissue extracts with sera from 40 to 50-week-old BH3 Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Interestingly, autoantibody binding was detected for all the BH3 Tg mice examined and most if not all the mice had autoantibodies against multiple tissues. Common banding patterns were observed amongst the BH3 Tg mice within a given tissue suggesting common autoantibody targets. Occasionally, autoantibodies were also found in some Bcl-2 Tg mice, but to a much lesser extent. An occasional band was sometimes observed in one of the wild-type controls, but these bands did not match the patterns observed in the BH3 Tg mice. A few BH3 Tg mice also exhibited a significant increase in anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). However, for the majority of the BH3 Tg mice, the levels were not appreciably higher than wild-type or Bcl-2 Tg mice, perhaps consistent with the autoimmune pathology in these mice being more predominantly T cell- rather than B cell-driven. In a few mice with high levels of ANA, significant disruption of kidney morphology was observed, reminiscent of glomerulonephritis (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Aged BH3 Tg mice also had significantly increased numbers of both CD25<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>\u2212</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells in their lymphoid organs, making up approximately 50% of all CD4 T cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013F</a>). This dramatic increase in T<sub>reg</sub> cells was still apparently insufficient to inhibit autoimmunity in these mice."

However, whether thymocyte deletion is necessary to maintain immunological self-tolerance remains under debate. Here, we find that T cell-specific over-expression of a <i>Bcl2</i> BH3 mutant transgene results in T cell-driven multi-organ autoimmunity, strongly suggesting that a defect in thymic deletion is indeed sufficient to cause a breakdown in tolerance. Consistent with previous observations, we found that T cell-specific over-expression of wild-type Bcl-2 did not cause significant autoimmune pathology (<a href=\"#bib24\">Linette et al., 1995</a>). However, our results show that Bcl-2 Tg mice may develop autoimmunity at low penetrance, as some mice exhibited a modest accumulation of activated T cells and autoantibodies. In contrast, expression of a <i>Bcl2</i> BH3 mutant transgene significantly increased the severity of the disease and resulted in greater than 70% lethality by one year-of-age. A significant accumulation of activated T cells was observed starting at 20 to 30 weeks-of-age and ultimately resulted in massive lymphoid hyperplasia, inflammation, lymphocyte infiltration into non-lymphoid organs and organ-targeted auto-antibody accumulation. This phenotype of low ANA antibody titers, activated T cells and organ-targeted autoantibodies is suggestive of a primarily T cell-mediated disease."

Abolishing the Nur77-dependent pro-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 by BH3 mutation might therefore enhance the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2 over-expression. Alternatively, it is also possible that slightly higher BH3 transgene expression levels in DP and CD4 SP cells could be responsible for this phenotype, although the levels of transgene expression do not necessarily correlate with GFP expression as demonstrated by the higher GFP M.F.I. in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of Bcl-2 over BH3 Tg mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Cause set aside, a greater defect in negative selection could allow a threshold to be crossed in which other mechanisms of maintaining tolerance are no longer sufficient to prevent disease. This would be consistent with the recent study comparing the severity of disease in <i>Bim</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> vs <i>Bim</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>Bbc3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice. <i>Bim</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice on the C57BL/6 background were reported to have attenuated autoimmunity and 80% of them still survive at 70 weeks-of-age (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bouillet et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Labi et al., 2014</a>). Additional loss of Puma (<i>Bbc3</i>), however, enhanced the thymic deletion defect of <i>Bim</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice and resulted in more severe, T cell-driven multi-organ autoimmune pathology (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gray et al., 2012</a>). It remains to be seen if loss of Bim and Puma in T cells alone would result in the same phenotype. Our observations in a T cell-specific model provide strong evidence that a severe thymic clonal deletion defect is sufficient to cause autoimmune pathology. Arguably, a defect in peripheral T cell deletion due to increased T cell survival may also contribute to the BH3 Tg phenotype. Although we cannot completely rule out this possibility, the fact that Bcl-2 Tg mice do not develop autoimmunity would suggest a minimal role for defective peripheral tolerance in this model."

Previously, Bcl-2 over-expression was directly compared with Bim-deficiency in the HY model and Bcl-2 over-expression fell significantly short of Bim-deficiency in rescuing thymocytes from deletion (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bouillet et al., 2002</a>). However, in our thymic slice assay of HY TCR-mediated deletion, we find that Bcl-2 over-expression almost completely blocks thymocyte death. Similarly, over-expression of Bcl-2 in F5 TCR transgenic mice dramatically blocked thymocyte deletion by thymic slice assay and in vivo peptide injection. One possible explanation for the discrepancy between our results and previously published observations might be the negative selection models used. Apoptosis of HY TCR transgenic mice is notoriously difficult to block due to accelerated T cell development and early expression of the transgenic TCR (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baldwin et al., 2005</a>). Indeed, using thymic organ culture, another group has previously reported a significant inhibition of negative selection by Bcl-2 in the F5 model (<a href=\"#bib47\">Williams et al., 1998</a>). Regardless, however, we have demonstrated that Bcl-2 over-expression has a potent anti-apoptotic effect on negative selection in a normal, polyclonal system. Mirroring observations in <i>Bim</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup>/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib40\">Stritesky et al., 2013</a>), we observed a striking increase in GFP-high post-selection thymocytes in Bcl-2/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice, indicating a significant rescue of high affinity TCR clones from deletion. Here, over-expression of the BH3 mutant transgene resulted in substantially greater rescue of GFP-high DP and CD4 SP thymocytes compared to over-expression of wild-type <i>Bcl2</i>. BH3 transgene expression also enhanced rescue of v\u03b25 and v\u03b26 DP and CD4 SP thymocytes from deletion in a polyclonal superantigen model of negative selection. Increased rescue of these cells in the thymus might lead to the development of a more self-reactive T cell repertoire, accelerating the expansion of activated T cells in BH3 Tg mice."

BH3 Tg mice have about a 3:1 ratio of CD4 to CD8 T cells in the lymph nodes compared to a 2:1 ratio in wild-type mice. In Bcl-2 Tg mice, the proportions are skewed in the opposite direction, resulting in a 1:1 ratio. This is likely due to a combination of transgene-biased rescue of cells from negative selection and increased survival of transgene-expressing T cells. BH3 Tg mice are therefore expected to have increased numbers of autoreactive CD4 T cells, which as key mediators of autoimmunity, could be responsible for the acceleration of disease in these mice (<a href=\"#bib32\">Palmer and Weaver, 2010</a>). Alternatively, as Bcl-2 over-expression reduces the ability of T cells to proliferate (<a href=\"#bib25\">Linette et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cheng et al., 2004</a>), downregulation of the BH3 transgene in CD8 T cells might enhance their functional capacity over that of Bcl-2 Tg CD8 T cells. As CD8 T cells play a well-documented role in T cell-mediated, tissue-specific autoimmune diseases (i.e. multiple sclerosis and diabetes), more functionally competent autoreactive CD8 T cells in the BH3 Tg mice might contribute to the development of disease (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gravano and Hoyer, 2013</a>)."

An increase in the proportion and number of T<sub>reg</sub> cells was noted in both the thymus and lymph nodes of young mice. Interestingly, CD25<sup>\u2212</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells accounted for most of the increase in total T<sub>reg</sub> numbers and these cells have been reported to have reduced suppressive function (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zhan et al., 2011</a>). These CD25<sup>\u2212</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells are thought to be derived from diverted, autoreactive cells that were not deleted in the thymus. Consistent with this, CD25<sup>\u2212</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells in the thymus expressed GFP at a higher level than CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells and at a similar level to the most GFP-high na\u00efve CD4 SP cells in the BH3/Nur77<sup>GFP</sup> mice. Hence, diverting a portion of these GFP-high autoreactive cells to this lineage might be the more effective tolerizing strategy. Notably, our observation that CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> proportions were not increased in the BH3 Tg mice suggests that T cells with self-reactive TCRs are not automatically committed to the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage and that there is likely a saturated niche for CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> development determined by availability of other factors, such as IL-2 and IL-15 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Stritesky et al., 2012</a>). In addition to increased T<sub>reg</sub> cells, we observed a 2-fold increase in the proportion of anergic CD4 T cells in the BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg mice. This was similarly observed in <i>Bim</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib40\">Stritesky et al., 2013</a>). Induction of anergy could cooperate with diversion to the T<sub>reg</sub> lineage/T<sub>reg</sub> suppression to inhibit T cell-mediated promotion of autoimmunity and prevent early onset of disease. However, differential induction of these tolerizing mechanisms was not observed in BH3 Tg vs Bcl-2 Tg mice and therefore cannot account for the eventual development of autoimmunity in BH3 Tg, but not Bcl-2 Tg mice. Interestingly, in aged BH3 Tg mice, T<sub>reg</sub> cells made up almost 50% of the CD4 T cell pool in mice displaying autoimmune pathology. However, this protective response was still apparently insufficient to suppress autoimmunity."

This finding may provide in vivo support for the notion that Nur77 promotes thymocyte apoptosis through conversion of Bcl-2 to a pro-apoptotic effector. However, this still needs to be further confirmed in a knock-in model. Additionally, analysis of a Bcl-2 protein that cannot interact with Nur77 would also be required to confirm that Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic function is Nur77-dependent. Intriguingly, it has previously been suggested that Nur77 and Bim might function in the same pathway, as Bim-deficiency was unable to synergize with Nur77-deficiency to inhibit thymocyte apoptosis in the OTII TCR transgenic model of negative selection (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fassett et al., 2012</a>). If Bcl-2 conversion is indeed critical for Nur77-mediated thymocyte apoptosis, this would support the idea that Nur77 and Bcl-2 family members come together at the mitochondria to cooperatively regulate cell death during negative selection."

The idea is that this form will be more effective at blocking negative selection and will more definitively address the need for central tolerance. Increased expression of a Nur77-promoter/enhancer-driven GFP transgene indicated that thymocytes that received stronger TCR signals accumulated in the thymus. A thorough characterization of the Bcl-2 BH3 mice as compared with mice over-expressing Bcl-2 alone revealed no substantial differences. Yet, as the mice aged (&gt;30 weeks old), they became ill and, sometimes, died. These mice had large spleens and more activated T cells."

Nur77/GFP expression from this transgene is reported to directly report TCR mediated signaling. Consistent with this notion, there are a large number of thymocytes that express high levels of GFP in the presence of the BCL-2 transgenes. Oddly, the GFP expression continues to be elevated in mature thymocytes and even in peripheral T cells. Is the interpretation that the ligands that induce negative selection in the cortex are also present in the medulla and the spleen/lymph nodes? Or is it possible that Nur77 is upregulated for reasons not associated with the TCR? One simple experiment would be to make single cell suspensions of the thymocytes (remove them from MHC), incubate and show that GFP expression is reduced. Alternatively, bone marrow chimeric mice can be generated with Bcl-2/Nur77-GFP bone marrow and MHC deficient host mice."

The generally low autoantibody titers against ANA along with the early activated T cell phenotype and multi-organ autoantibody response (see response to point 2 below) argue in favor of T cell-mediated autoimmunity rather than a systemic, SLE-like disease. A defect in peripheral T cell deletion due to increased T cell survival may also contribute to the BH3 Tg phenotype. Although we cannot completely rule out this possibility, the fact that Bcl-2 Tg mice do not develop autoimmunity would suggest a minimal role of peripheral tolerance in this model. We have included a statement concerning this point in the revised discussion. In addition, we have softened our language throughout the text to reflect the caveat that factors other than negative selection may play a role in the autoimmunity of BH3 Tg mice."

This figure depicts tissue extracts from non-immune organs (pancreas, eye, lung, liver, kidney and stomach) probed with sera from aged mice. Interestingly, autoantibody binding was detected for all the BH3 Tg mice examined and most if not all the mice had autoantibodies against multiple tissues. Common banding patterns were observed amongst the BH3 Tg mice within a given tissue suggesting common autoantibody targets. Occasionally, we also detected autoantibody binding in some Bcl- 2 Tg mice, but fewer or weaker bands were observed compared to the BH3 Tg mice. We also detected an occasional band in one of the wild-type controls, maybe due to the old age of the mice, but these bands did not correspond with the banding patterns observed in the BH3 Tg mice. The presence of autoantibodies in all the BH3 Tg mice that react to multiple bands in the tissue extracts further support our conclusion that the BH3 Tg mice develop multi-organ autoimmunity."

Nur77/GFP expression from this transgene is reported to directly report TCR mediated signaling. Consistent with this notion, there are a large number of thymocytes that express high levels of GFP in the presence of the BCL-2 transgenes. Oddly, the GFP expression continues to be elevated in mature thymocytes and even in peripheral T cells. Is the interpretation that the ligands that induce negative selection in the cortex are also present in the medulla and the spleen/lymph nodes? Or is it possible that Nur77 is upregulated for reasons not associated with the TCR? One simple experiment would be to make single cell suspensions of the thymocytes (remove them from MHC), incubate and show that GFP expression is reduced. Alternatively, bone marrow chimeric mice can be generated with Bcl-2/Nur77-GFP bone marrow and MHC deficient host mice</i>."

GFP signal is gradually downregulated as thymocytes mature from DP to SP to recent thymic emigrant and na\u00efve T cells in the periphery. They showed that na\u00efve T cells do continue to express a low level of Nur77 GFP because naive T cells presumably need a low level tonic TCR stimulation to survive (as demonstrated by several classical papers) . Indeed, CD4 T cells transferred to an MHC II-deficient host downregulated GFP further over time (Moran et al. JEM 2011). Hence, Nur77 GFP expression in mature T cells is likely in part leftover from TCR engagement in the thymus, but is also due to TCR engagement in the periphery."

Since SP thymocytes continue to undergo negative selection in the medulla, increased Nur77 GFP expression by BH3 and Bcl-2 Tg SP cells can be due to both rescue of cells seeing ligand in the medulla and leftover expression from stimulus at the DP stage. Similar to mature T cells, we found that SP thymocytes removed from MHC by culturing, downregulate GFP at a similar rate to WT SP thymocytes, suggesting that GFP expression is TCR-dependent, and not transgene-dependent (new <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, we have shown in the original manuscript that transgenic pre-selection DP thymocytes do not express Nur77 GFP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), suggesting again that Nur77 GFP expression is TCR -dependent. As bone marrow chimera-derived thymocytes in an MHC- deficient host would be arrested at the pre-selection DP stage, we don\u2019t believe this experiment would provide any additional information."
