Navigating and route-following require animals to recognize places. Currently, it is mostly unknown how bats recognize places using echolocation. In this paper, we propose template based place recognition might underlie sonar-based navigation in bats. Under this hypothesis, bats recognize places by remembering their echo signature - rather than their 3D layout. Using a large body of ensonification data collected in three different habitats, we test the viability of this hypothesis assessing two critical properties of the proposed echo signatures: (1) they can be uniquely classified and (2) they vary continuously across space. Based on the results presented, we conclude that the proposed echo signatures satisfy both criteria. We discuss how these two properties of the echo signatures can support navigation and building a cognitive map."

Navigating and route-following require animals to recognize places. Currently, it is mostly unknown how bats recognize places using echolocation. In this paper, we propose template based place recognition might underlie sonar-based navigation in bats. Under this hypothesis, bats recognize places by remembering their echo signature - rather than their 3D layout. Using a large body of ensonification data collected in three different habitats, we test the viability of this hypothesis assessing two critical properties of the proposed echo signatures: (1) they can be uniquely classified and (2) they vary continuously across space. Based on the results presented, we conclude that the proposed echo signatures satisfy both criteria. We discuss how these two properties of the echo signatures can support navigation and building a cognitive map."

Experimental results obtained using both <i>Phyllostomus hastatus</i> and <i>Rousettus aegyptiacus</i> suggest that long distance navigation and migration seem to be supported mainly by visual cues (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tsoar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Holland, 2007</a>). However, when displaced by less than about 15 km, both <i>Myotis</i> spp. and <i>Phyllostomus hastatus</i> deprived of sight have been found to successfully return to their roost (<a href=\"#bib56\">Stones and Branick, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Williams et al., 1966</a>). This shows that navigation in bats can be supported by echolocation as well as vision. Navigating and route-following require animals to recognize places (<a href=\"#bib10\">Franz and Mallot, 2000)</a>. Currently, it is largely unknown how bats recognize places using echolocation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schnitzler et al., 2003</a>) and different mechanisms are possible (<a href=\"#bib15\">Geva-Sagiv et al., 2015</a>)."

However, a number of limitations of bio-sonar render it uncertain whether bats are able to apply such a place recognition strategy. Low signal-to-noise\u00a0ratio obscures echo spectra (<a href=\"#bib39\">Reijniers et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, ambiguity of cues is introduced by concurrently encoding in the spectral cues both location and other properties of objects. For example, a spectral notch could be introduced by either the head related transfer function (encoding the object\u2019s location) or the transfer function of the reflector (encoding the object\u2019s shape). This complicates extracting both object properties and object positions. Reconstructing the 3D position of objects is further complicated by the fact that, compared to vision, sonar has a limited field of view (<a href=\"#bib58\">Surlykke et al., 2009</a>), a low update rate (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kleeman and Kuc, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Peremans et al., 2012</a>) and a limited range (<a href=\"#bib55\">Stilz and Schnitzler, 2012</a>).

This volume can be appropriately described as a section of a spherical shell. The thickness of the shell is determined by the temporal integration of the hearing apparatus. The opening angle of the section is determined by the directionality of the sonar system. Hence, the integrated volume increases rapidly for larger distances from the bat (See <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and equation therein). For example, at a distance of 7.8 meters, an echolocation system with a beamwidth of 45 degrees is estimated to integrate the echoes originating from a volume of over 1\u2009m<sup>3</sup>. At the same distance, a system with a functional beamwidth of 60 degrees integrates echoes from a volume of about 2\u2009m<sup>3</sup>. Echoes originating from reflectors within this volume will be integrated and it is not clear that they will be perceived as individual echoes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Geberl, 2013</a>). Indeed, in general, this volume will contain multiple reflectors. This is especially true when the scene contains complex objects such as leafy trees or bushes (See <a href=\"#bib77\">Yovel et al., 2008</a> for examples of echo trains returning from vegetation)."

Under this hypothesis, bats are assumed to match the output of the cochlea to a set of stored templates, i.e., classifying the echo signature as one of a set of memorized echo signatures each one recorded at a previously visited place. This approach obviates the need for complex reconstruction algorithms extracting 3D spatial information from the echo signals at the two ears. As it uses the sensory input directly, our approach to place recognition is analogous to the view-based place recognition that is thought to underlie visual navigation in insects (<a href=\"#bib78\">Zeil et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Franz and Mallot, 2000</a>)."

In brief, the model consists of a Gammatone filterbank with central frequencies ranging from 30 kHz to 100 kHz in steps of 5 kHz. Subsequently, each channel is exponentially compressed (using an exponent value of 0.4) and low-pass filtered (1 kHz cut-off, 12 dB slope per octave). The cochleogram returned by the model was dechirped by shifting each frequency channel in time (zero-padding at the end) such that the maximum activation, corresponding to the pick up of the emitted signal, is aligned across frequency channels. The first 5.8 ms (corresponding to about 1\u2009m) of the data in each frequency channel were set to zero to avoid including the pick up of the emitted signal or any lingering decay thereof in the analysis. In the model formulated by <a href=\"#bib70\">Wiegrebe (2008)</a> a similar operation is performed by means of a channel-wise normalized autocorrelation between call and echoes. However, <a href=\"#bib70\">Wiegrebe (2008)</a> worked with simulated calls and echoes. In contrast, in our real measurements, the emission of the pulse saturated the microphones. Hence, we did not have the picked up call available to perform the autocorrelation with. Therefore, we approximated the autocorrelation step in Wiegrebe\u2019s model (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wiegrebe, 2008</a>) by the dechirping operation described above. Both approaches would result in similar templates."

Therefore, templates were averaged across 3 neighbouring\u00a0directions of the pan tilt system in elevation and azimuth to approximate the broader directional sensitivity of bats.

In other words, we assume that the just-noticeable echo intensity difference in bats is 2 dB. Based on the evidence we could find, a just-noticeable-difference of 2 dB is a conservative estimate of the intensity discrimination ability of bats (<a href=\"#bib50\">Simmons and Vernon, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Suthers, 1965</a>).

In contrast, for the Semi Cluttered and the Cluttered habitats, there was a tendency for the dissimilarity to increase as a function of angular separation (except for Semi Cluttered 4). The angular separation at which the dissimilarity leveled off varied across habitats and habitat types. However, angular catchment areas up to about 90 degrees (Semi 3) and 150 degrees (Cluttered 2) were found. This indicates that, on average, the dissimilarity between templates is a monotonic function of angular separation over a wide range of separation angles."

Indeed, the templates were constructed by averaging the cochleograms over the frequencies thereby removing spectral cues (Algorithm 1, step 3). In addition, dechirping of the spectrograms (Algorithm 1, step 1) makes the templates largely independent from call duration. This has two implications. First, navigation by templates as proposed here does not depend heavily on call design. Indeed, the spectral and temporal aspects of bats\u2019 calls can vary from call to call, e.g. (<a href=\"#bib60\">Surlykke and Moss, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kalko, 1995</a>). By using descriptors of the environment that do not depend critically on call design a bat could navigate the same environment largely independent of the call used. A second implication is that template based navigation should also be feasible for bats using narrowband calls. For example, Rhinolophidae use long narrowband calls preceded and/or followed by a short frequency sweep (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schnitzler and Denzinger, 2011</a>). The frequency range of these sweeps is limited compared to the sweeps used by bats using frequency modulated calls. Nevertheless, Rhinolophidae have specialized in hunting under cluttered circumstances and face rather challenging navigation tasks (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schnitzler et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Schnitzler and Kalko, 2001</a>). A mechanism for recognizing places that does not rely on spectral cues makes for a more plausible candidate for explaining how these bats can find their way using calls with a limited bandwidth."

The catchment distances reported here are also substantially larger than those found in a robotic experiment by <a href=\"#bib54\">Steckel and Peremans (2013)</a>. These authors collected sonar based templates in an office environment by driving around a robot equipped with a biomimetic sonar system. They found that displacing the robot by about 14 cm or 20 degrees resulted in leaving the current template\u2019s catchment area. In spite of these small catchment areas, they successfully derived a map of the office using the templates. Hence, successful navigation seems to be possible with catchment areas that are smaller than those found in this paper."

A bat flying through the environment and calling at 10\u2009Hz will always sample the template\u2019s catchment region if its diameter is larger than 1\u2009m.

Even at 5 ms, he found bats to restrict their angular velocity to about 280 deg/s. At a call rate of 10\u2009Hz, this implies a change in direction of about 28 degrees per call. At 10 ms<sup>\u22121</sup>, this reduces to about 6 degrees per call. Hence, the changes in the orientation of a commuting bat between calls seem to be less than the angular catchment distances found here. Active scanning would result in larger changes in gaze direction. In a study quantifying the scanning behaviour of <i>Pipistrellus pipistrellus</i> in the field the largest angle between subsequent call directions was found to be 51 degrees. Hence, this study suggests that, even while actively scanning, bats tend to change the direction of their beam by less than the angular catchment distances of templates in cluttered and semi-cluttered environments. In summary, it seems that the angular spatial sample rate maintained by bats is higher than the average angular catchment distances of templates."

As mentioned in the introduction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), both parameters determine the volume of space across which echoes are integrated. Wider beams and longer temporal integration result in templates that vary more smoothly with orientation and position in space. For an account of bat navigation that assumes bats to reconstruct a 3D model from an echo train the beam width and temporal integration constitute limitations of the echolocation system by reducing its resolution. In contrast, for a template based approach wider beams and longer integration times are not necessarily a problem. In contrast, these factors might facilitate navigation. As such, the finding that different bat species actively control their emission beams to converge on nearly the same field of view (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jakobsen et al., 2013</a>) could indicate that bats perform an optimal spatial smoothing while navigating the environment. Note that, as shown by these authors, optimal fields of view are task and habitat depending resulting in different trade-offs between beam range and width with corresponding linear and angular catchment area sizes."

Distant reflectors move more slowly through the bat\u2019s \u2019field of view\u2019, i.e., they undergo a smaller degree of motion parallax. As our data shows, this results in templates with larger catchment distances. This might facilitate navigation. On the other hand, the Royal Fort Gardens data suggest that the higher motion parallax for closer reflectors results in a better template classification. Indeed, closer reflectors change more abruptly when moving through space. This seems to result in templates that are easier to classify \u2013 at the cost of smaller linear catchment distances. In short, our data reveals a trade-off between the linear catchment distance size and the probability of correct classification of a template. The existence of this trade-off is confirmed by the negative correlation we found between the linear catchment distance size and the probability of correct classification."

In addition, flying further away from objects will, in general, result in weaker echoes (in our Israel data this effect has been offset by the strong echoes returned by the rocks).

As shown by the simulation results presented by <a href=\"#bib65\">Vanderelst et al.

Furthermore, while it contains a stochastic component this obstacle avoidance behaviour still constrains the movement through the environment causing the bat to follow a limited set of routes through a given environment. The results presented here on the sizes of the catchment areas indicate that any sensorimotor strategy that causes the bats to repeatedly visit approximately the same sites will allow them to explore their environment while building a library of templates describing this environment.

BatSLAM is a bio-inspired sonar navigation algorithm, derived from RatSLAM (<a href=\"#bib35\">Milford et al., 2004</a>), mirroring the basic functionality of the mammalian hippocampus. In brief, the algorithm directly uses the spectrogram of the echoes as a template to recognize distinct places. The odometry is used to estimate the relative position of different locations labelled by their respective spectrograms. The algorithm averages across measurements of the very noisy odometry for different travels between the same locations. Finally, agreement between conflicting information is sought by applying a relaxation algorithm. The outcome of this process is a graph-like representation of the relative locations of different recognizable places (see <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). Details of the mapping algorithm have been presented by <a href=\"#bib54\">Steckel and Peremans (2013)</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#bib73\">Wyeth and Milford (2009)</a>.

This might occur through two different but converging mechanisms. First, prominent reflectors often result in idiosyncratic and thus highly classifiable templates. As BatSLAM uses recognition of previously visited places to drive the relaxation algorithm, the places associated with such templates will act as anchor points for the graph-like map. Indeed, if a place is highly recognizable odometric errors occurring along the various routes that pass through this place will be easier to remove by the relaxation process. Consequently, the metric positions of the routes passing through this place will be defined more precisely relative to the other important places represented in the map, such as start and goal position. A path planner considering this a desirable property would then preferentially generate routes passing through the catchment area associated with this prominent reflector. In our data, highly recognizable templates in the semi-cluttered environments coincided with the locations of shrubs and trees, suggesting their possible use as landmarks. Secondly, prominent reflectors often generate strong echoes making them detectable from a long distance and resulting in the corresponding templates to have large catchment areas (For example, in this paper, the rocks at the Isreal site, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8</a>,<a href=\"#fig9\">9</a>,<a href=\"#fig10\">10</a>)."

By biasing the templates included in the map, this mechanism would again bias a planner to generate routes passing through the catchment areas of prominent reflectors. In our data, the linear catchment distances were found to be larger in the Israeli corridor of boulders than in the corridor of vegetation in Royal Fort Gardens, suggesting a possible preference for the use of the former as landmarks. We conclude that a navigation strategy relying on a template based map would show a natural preference for routes including prominent landscape features. Hence, we propose that the use of landmarks might be an emergent feature of a mapping strategy recognizing locations using templates (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wystrach et al., 2011</a>)."

It could be argued that, since bats have been shown to be capable of recognizing objects, they could very well use that same capability to recognize scenes based on the 3D object layout. However, we would like to point out that the behaviour of bats in recognition experiments differs from that of cruising/navigating bats. In recognition experiments, bats typically ensonify the same object from different directions as part of an active object-centred exploration process, e.g. (<a href=\"#bib13\">Genzel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Geipel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Simon et al., 2006</a>). Cruising/navigating bats, on the other hand, fly by objects along their flight path resulting in a more accidental, i.e. less object-centred, and less extensive series of observations of those objects. Such a fly-by mode of echolocation is well suited to the proposed template-based strategy as it requires local \u2019snapshots\u2019 only. Also, we would like to argue that even in the object recognition experiments bats might not be building a 3D reconstruction of the object. They might instead be looking for diagnostic acoustic cues, e.g. spectral cues as hypothesized in the study by <a href=\"#bib52\">Simon et al. (2006)</a>. Such an account of object recognition would be easily integrated with our template-based account of place recognition. One possible way the two might interact is that the template-based place descriptors would be used to build a map first and then later (or possibly in parallel) \u2019landmarks\u2019, i.e. uniquely identified objects, would be associated with places on the map."

Therefore, behavioural evidence in favour of our approach would consist of bats failing to distinguish complex scenes giving rise to many echoes, i.e. with a similar complexity of their natural habitats, that result in the same template, essentially a low-pass filtered range-intensity profile. To test this, one could generate echoes from a complex virtual scene and its mirror image. These should result in the same template whereas a 3D model account predicts bats should be able to distinguish between the two scenes. Alternatively and possibly more straightforward to test, the 3D model account predicts bats would be able to recognize echoes coming from rotated versions of the same underlying scene. The template approach predicts that bats would be unable to make such generalizations for larger rotations, i.e. once the measured template would fall outside the catchment area of the stored template."

The authors suggest that to recognize certain locations echolocating bats might employ place templates based on a specific echo signature rather than the 3 dimensional layout of the echo-acoustic scene. By assessing templates' discriminability and continuity independent of the spectral content of the ensonifying signal the proposed model was able to reliably recognize locations allowing which they claim can be sufficient for a successful navigation and orientation in an echo-acoustic environment. Yet, while this paper is intriguing, it might also be pushing the interpretation a little bit too far and should be considered in the larger scope of knowledge about bats, their navigation abilities and what is known so far regarding the link between their neural circuits and echolocation."

Previous studies, also using artificial machines, have shown the capacity of bat-like sonar pulses to extract useful information about the environment, the leap towards suggesting that bats maintain a remarkably large library of pulse signatures to navigate in 3D rather than a memory of a 3D layout (perhaps in the hippocampal formation) is not well supported. From an etiological perspective it is unclear what would drive the system to prefer sonar-based place recognition over 3D spatial memory of the environment as that seems much less of an efficient recognition mechanism and one that is much less easily generalizable and amenable to changes in the environment. The authors also argue in the Discussion that \"indirect evidence of a cognitive map exist through findings of grid-cells and place-cells in bats\" but in fact those finding are contradicting their claim because those studies have shown that place/grid-cells can exist in the complete absence of echolocation, thus arguing echolocation is not, in fact, necessary for the formation of spatial maps in the hippocampal formation. Nonetheless the paper and the proposed hypothesis in intriguing albeit unlikely capturing the true nature of bat 3D navigation."

This induces conflicting information concerning position and shape. This is certainly true but what the authors fail to mention is that bats \u2013 along with most mammals \u2013 have very flexible and most often disproportionally large ears. This allows them to rapidly move their ears independent of their head and therefore still keeps the outgoing ensonification signal directed toward the object of interest. These rapid ear movements introduce dynamic binaural cues relevant for horizontal object localization but more importantly here also relevant for elevation estimation. Efferent feedback signals encode the ears' position, which is integrated in the evaluation of the incoming echoes. This allows for a better localization performance and thereby can reduce possible conflicts of object shape and position."

In fact, distinct spectral cues are generated when temporally peaks are integrated, allowing for object recognition through spectral peak or notch detection (shown in many previous studies). Objects are therefore distinguishable through distinct temporal peaks or when not temporally resolvable through their spectral cues and notches. At the neural level, the work by Jim Simmons further supports this statement. Furthermore, integration can occur at later stages of processing beyond the auditory cortex. While a large fraction of neurophysiological studies have focused on the bat A1, there are many subsequent stages of processing that could lead to a coherent perception of the bat's location in 3D, including the hippocampal formation, basal ganglia, frontal cortex, colliculus, etc."

Is subsampling an appropriate way to compensate for integration time? As I understand it, within the integration window accumulated information introduces masking because multiple echoes introduced within that time will be \"combined\" or considered together (integrated). It seems to me that subsampling would be less akin to integration and more akin to a \"refractory period\" in which only one echo within the window is taken into consideration, after which no echoes are considered until the end of the window. Would averaging the samples within each 350 \u03bcs block be a more appropriate approximation of integration time?"

However, the studies cited for these two pieces of evidence refer to distinct species of bats that arose from separate lineages. <i>Rousettus aegyptiacus</i> (Tsoar et al., 2011) is a fruit- eating megabat belonging to the same clade as flying foxes and other fruit bats that rely exclusively on vision. It is the only member of its clade to have evolved echolocation in the form of tongue clicks, which are not as sophisticated as the laryngeal echolocation used by microbats, the clade that contains all other echolocating bats including those used in citations [Stones and Branick, 1969] and [Williams, Williams and Griffin, 1966] (<i>Myotis spp.</i> and <i>Phyllostomus hastatus</i>). The diets and environments of the three species are also quite different. Because the animals evolved to address different environmental pressures it is somewhat misleading to omit the species names in the text, as the findings of one study may not generalize to the species used in the others. The paper never states what genus or even family of bat is most closely modeled by the ensonification device, which is important because many bats have different types of echolocation and foraging strategies. Specifically, which species provided the model for the hyperbolic simulated pulse? Are bats that use calls resembling the simulated pulse found in all three areas ensonified in this study? At what height was the ensonification device placed? Was this the approximate height that bats living in the area might be expected to fly?"

The criteria for template viability were that a place template had to be discriminable from others, and that it was continuous, i.e. more similar to templates of nearby vs. distant locations. Simulated classification results (using Mahalanobis distance as a discrimination metric) were generally consistent with the clutter of the scenes surveyed. In open spaces with few landmarks, performance was low; in more cluttered spaces performance was high. Additionally, discriminable scenes tended to be continuous.

The bases for this argument are plausible, but stop short of ruling out explicit object layout reconstruction as a navigational cue. After all, bats do perform object recognition and localization. Integrating across multiple echo calls, for example, might allow an echolocating bat to ameliorate the spatial blur imposed by the integration time described in the paper. In this vein, the authors might also elaborate on object recognition vs. place recognition \"modes\" of echolocation. If object-recognition mechanisms are not part of template-based navigation strategy, is there a tradeoff between navigation and object perception performance?"

However, a strategy, as proposed by the reviewer, where the bat keeps its relative position to the target fixed and systematically moves its ears to disambiguate spectral cues due to shape from those due to relative position seems feasible only when both bat and target are stationary. Finally, we have studied ear motions similar to the ones described by the reviewer, i.e. those found in the Rhinolophidae, and their potential functionality in detail (see references below analyzing the localization information provided by these motions). This analysis shows that multiple closely-spaced reflectors (as opposed to a single prey target) would prevent the ear movements from introducing reliable 3D cues."

Objects are therefore distinguishable through distinct temporal peaks or when not temporally resolvable through their spectral cues and notches. At the neural level, the work by Jim Simmons further supports this statement. Furthermore, integration can occur at later stages of processing beyond the auditory cortex. While a large fraction of neurophysiological studies have focused on the bat A1, there are many subsequent stages of processing that could lead to a coherent perception of the bat's location in 3D, including the hippocampal formation, basal ganglia, frontal cortex, colliculus, etc.\u2026</i> "

We agree with both reviewers that bats have the ability to recognize objects. However, the behaviour of bats in recognition experiments differs from that of cruising/navigating bats. In recognition experiments, bats typically ensonify the same object from different directions as part of an active object-centered exploration process. Cruising/navigating bats on the other hand, fly by the objects along their flight path resulting in a more accidental, i.e. less object- centered, and less extensive series of observations of those objects. The proposed template-based strategy is well suited to such a fly-by mode of echolocation. Also, we would like to point out that even in the object recognition experiments bats might not be building a 3D reconstruction of the object. They might instead be looking for diagnostic acoustic cues, e.g. spectral cues as hypothesised in the study by Simon et al. Such an account of object recognition would be easily integrated with our template-based account of place recognition. One possible way the two might interact is that the template-based place descriptors would be used to build a map first and then later (or possibly in parallel) 'landmarks', i.e. uniquely identified objects, would be associated with places in the map. However, at this stage this is not much more than conjecture and we have not proposed specific mechanisms for how to do this. Hence, we prefer to keep this topic for future work."

So, if it is currently at Y it will expect to be in X next when executing a particular flight routine. Such a mechanism is shown to work quite well in an indoor office environment in the biologically inspired BatSLAM algorithm (see reference below).

Rousettus aegyptiacus (Tsoar et al., 2011) is a fruit- eating megabat belonging to the same clade as flying foxes and other fruit bats that rely exclusively on vision. It is the only member of its clade to have evolved echolocation in the form of tongue clicks, which are not as sophisticated as the laryngeal echolocation used by microbats, the clade that contains all other echolocating bats including those used in citations [Stones and Branick, 1969] and [Williams, Williams and Griffin, 1966] (Myotis spp. and Phyllostomus hastatus).

To test this, one could generate echoes from a complex virtual scene and its mirror image. These should result in the same template whereas a 3D model account predicts bats should be able to distinguish between the two scenes. Alternatively, and possibly more straightforward to test, the 3D model account predicts bats would be able to recognize echoes coming from rotated versions of the same underlying scene.

We agree with both reviewers that bats have the ability to recognize objects. However, the behaviour of bats in recognition experiments differs from that of cruising/navigating bats. In recognition experiments, bats typically ensonify the same object from different directions as part of an active object-centered exploration process. Cruising/navigating bats on the other hand, fly by the objects along their flight path resulting in a more accidental, i.e. less object-centered, and less extensive series of observations of those objects. The proposed template-based strategy is well suited to such a fly-by mode of echolocation. Also, we would like to point out that even in the object recognition experiments bats might not be building a 3D reconstruction of the object. They might instead be looking for diagnostic acoustic cues, e.g. spectral cues as hypothesised in the study by Simon et al. Such an account of object recognition would be easily integrated with our template-based account of place recognition. One possible way the two might interact is that the template-based place descriptors would be used to build a map first and then later (or possibly in parallel) 'landmarks', i.e. uniquely identified objects, would be associated with places in the map. However, at this stage this is not much more than conjecture and we have not proposed specific mechanisms for how to do this. Hence, we prefer to keep this topic for future work."
