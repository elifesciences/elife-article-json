Here, we patch clamp single motile cilia of mammalian ependymal cells and examine their potential function as a calcium signaling compartment. Resting motile cilia calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ~170 nM) is only slightly elevated over cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (~100 nM) at steady state. Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes that arise in the cytoplasm rapidly equilibrate in motile cilia. We measured Ca<sub>V</sub>1 voltage-gated calcium channels in ependymal cells, but these channels are not specifically enriched in motile cilia. Membrane depolarization increases ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], but only marginally alters cilia beating and cilia-driven fluid velocity within short (~1 min) time frames. We conclude that beating of ependymal motile cilia is not tightly regulated by voltage-gated calcium channels, unlike that of well-studied motile cilia and flagella in protists, such as <i>Paramecia</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas</i>."

Here, we patch clamp single motile cilia of mammalian ependymal cells and examine their potential function as a calcium signaling compartment. Resting motile cilia calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ~170 nM) is only slightly elevated over cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (~100 nM) at steady state. Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes that arise in the cytoplasm rapidly equilibrate in motile cilia. We measured Ca<sub>V</sub>1 voltage-gated calcium channels in ependymal cells, but these channels are not specifically enriched in motile cilia. Membrane depolarization increases ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], but only marginally alters cilia beating and cilia-driven fluid velocity within short (~1 min) time frames. We conclude that beating of ependymal motile cilia is not tightly regulated by voltage-gated calcium channels, unlike that of well-studied motile cilia and flagella in protists, such as <i>Paramecia</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas</i>."

Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx also alters the flagellar waveform or ciliary beating direction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> and <i>Paramecium,</i> respectively, and arrests beating in Mussel gill epithelia (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bessen et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Inaba, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Naito and Kaneko, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tsuchiya, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Walter and Satir, 1978</a>). Analysis of <i>Paramecium</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas</i> mutants and electrophysiological recordings identified voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>) in cilia/flagellar membranes as required regulators of ciliary beating (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beck and Uhl, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dunlap, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fujiu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kung and Naito, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Matsuda et al., 1998</a>). These observations suggest a conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-dependent mechanism regulating flagellar/ciliary beating. Whether ion channels in motile cilia of mammalian cells changes their beat frequency is not clear, but intraciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent changes in motile cilia beating has been reported by several groups (<a href=\"#bib11\">Di Benedetto et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Girard and Kennedy, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lansley et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nguyen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schmid and Salathe, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Verdugo, 1980</a>). The question that we seek to answer in this study is whether Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeant ion channels are present in motile cilia, and if so, do they change motile cilia behavior."

Here, we examined ion currents in fluorescently-labeled, voltage-clamped motile cilia of brain ependymal cells and demonstrate that motile cilia are well coupled electrically and by diffusion to the cellular compartment. We show that few Ca<sub>V</sub> channels are present in the cilia membrane, that resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is only slightly elevated in motile cilia, and that motile cilia [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is driven primarily by changes in cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Excitation of the ependymal cell by membrane depolarization increases ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] with only minor changes in motility and fluid movement, suggesting that beating of ependymal motile cilia is not significantly regulated by the activity of ciliary or cytoplasmic Ca<sub>V</sub> channels."

Sparsely ciliated cells may be the result of ependymal cell maturation, in vitro culturing, or represent a population of previously reported biciliated ependymal cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mirzadeh et al., 2008</a>).

In response to a hyperpolarizing voltage step, capacitive current relaxation was 8\u201310 times faster in whole-cell recordings (0.3 \u00b1 0.1 ms in aCSF/FFA and 0.4 \u00b1 0.1 ms in TEA-Cl/BaCl<sub>2</sub>) than in whole-motile-cilium recordings (3.1 \u00b1 0.3 ms in aCSF/FFA and 3.3 \u00b1 0.4 ms in TEA-Cl/BaCl<sub>2</sub>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). By integrating the current transient to yield net capacitance, we determined that a similar surface area was charged in whole-cell (20.4 \u00b1 3.2 pF in aCSF/FFA, 18.5 \u00b1 2.5 pF in TEA-Cl/BaCl<sub>2</sub>) and whole-motile-cilium recordings (18.3 \u00b1 2.4 pF in aCSF/FFA, 19.0 \u00b1 2.8 pF in TEA-Cl/BaCl<sub>2</sub>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Calculating the series resistance from the time constant and membrane capacitance, we determined a nine\u2013ten fold higher resistance in whole-motile-cilia recordings (180.3 \u00b1 20.6 M\u2126 in aCSF/FFA and 188.2 \u00b1 25.0 M\u2126 in TEA-Cl/BaCl<sub>2</sub>) as compared to whole-cell recordings (18.0 \u00b1 3.4 M\u2126 in aCSF/FFA and 20.2 \u00b1 3.7 M\u2126 in TEA-Cl/BaCl<sub>2</sub>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Together these findings suggest that motile cilia are indeed electrically coupled to the cellular compartment via a high resistance cable determined by the length and cross-sectional area of a motile cilium (estimated as ~350 M\u03a9 for an ideally insulated cable; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). In other words, currents recorded in the whole-motile-cilium configuration can be attributed to channel openings in the cell and/or cilia membrane. Finally, we measured an only slightly depolarized resting membrane potential for motile cilia as compared to the ependymal cell body (-77 \u00b1 3 mV, motile cilia; -88 \u00b1 2 mV, cell body; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>)."

However, we were unable to detach and record from isolated motile cilia, as we were able to do in primary cilia (<a href=\"#bib8\">DeCaen et al., 2013</a>). Thus, we recorded from cell and motile cilia membranes in the membrane-attached configuration. Prolonged single channel openings in the presence of BayK8644 averaged 1.4 pA at 0 mV (from the record shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and were frequently observed in cell-attached recordings, but were typically not detected in cilium-attached recordings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>). Despite many attempts, brief single channel openings reminiscent of L-type channel openings in the absence of BayK8644 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hess et al., 1984</a>) were recorded from only a single motile cilium patch (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Full-length ciliary recordings (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kleene and Kleene, 2012</a>), were also not feasible given the presence of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels in the cell membrane. Nevertheless, the low percentage of motile cilium patches in which we observed Ca<sub>V</sub> channel openings suggests that Ca<sub>V</sub> channels are not enriched in ependymal motile cilia. If channel densities are identical in cell and cilia membranes, we would only expect ~3 channels in a motile cilium (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeant ion channels and currents in motile cilia are clearly distinct from the nonselective currents recorded from primary cilia (<a href=\"#bib8\">DeCaen et al., 2013</a>)."

Previous work established Somatostatin Receptor 3 (SSTR3) transgene expression in ependymal motile cilia (<a href=\"#bib41\">O'Connor et al., 2013</a>). We fused GCaMP6s (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2013</a>) with mCherry to the C-terminus of SSTR3 and transduced cultured ependymal cells with a recombinant adenoviral vector (pAd-mSSTR3-mCherry-GCaMP6s), resulting in abundant expression of the sensor in motile cilia (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Addition of ionomycin evoked a rapid increase in GCaMP6s fluorescence, confirming the ability of the sensor to report changes in ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). We calibrated the ratiometric sensor (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) and determined the average ratio of F_GCaMP6s and F_mCherry in motile cilia under basal conditions (aCSF, 1.4 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). To avoid offsets in the position of beating cilia, we scanned non-sequentially and corrected ratios for bleed-through (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>, and Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Consistent with a relatively low number of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels and a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (at which Ca<sub>V</sub> channels are inactive), we determined the resting motile cilia [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] as 165 nM (average ratio: 0.2 \u00b1 0.01; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D, E</a>). In control experiments in which immobilized cilia were scanned sequentially, a similar resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was determined (167 nM, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, and see below).

A brief uncaging stimulus in the cytoplasm rapidly increased ciliary GCaMP6s fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). However, imaging motile cilia through the z-axis of the cilia (that is, top or bottom views) prevented further analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion. In order to track Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves, we halted ciliary beating and imaged ependymal cilia from the side (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). As reported previously, sodium metavanadate (SMVD) treatment greatly reduced motility, presumably through inhibition of the dynein ATPase (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gibbons et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nakamura and Sato, 1993</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). Upon uncaging at the ciliary base (visualized by additional loading of the cells with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM, OGB-1), Ca<sup>2+</sup> entered the cilium and moved from the base to the tip with an apparent velocity of 22 \u00b1 3 \u03bcm/s (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013I</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Thus, fluctuations in cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] can readily diffuse across the cell-cilia boundary to modify motile cilia [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], as we found for primary cilia (<a href=\"#bib10\">Delling et al., 2013</a>)."

Differences in the rise times of the two Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (OGB-1 and GCaMP6s) precluded a meaningful analysis of signal onsets in motile cilia versus the cytoplasm. The homogeneity of voltage in cell body and cilium, as well as the observed rapid diffusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytoplasm into motile cilia, suggests that ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] will increase quickly, irrespective of the localization of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). By recording ependymal cells in current clamp, we measured the response to increasing external [K<sup>+</sup>] and observed a depolarization of membrane potential from -87 \u00b1 3 mV at rest (aCSF 3\u2009K<sup>+</sup>) to -48 \u00b1 5 mV, -31 \u00b1 1 mV, -18 \u00b1 0.7 mV, and -1.7 \u00b1 2 mV in aCSF 20\u2009K<sup>+</sup>, 40\u2009K<sup>+</sup>, 70\u2009K<sup>+</sup>, or 140\u2009K<sup>+</sup>, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

We observed no significant difference in the beating frequency during perfusion of depolarizing external [K<sup>+</sup>] solution (aCSF 70\u2009K<sup>+</sup> or aCSF 140\u2009K<sup>+</sup>). For example, cilia beat frequency was initially 9.7 \u00b1 1\u2009Hz (0\u20131\u2009s) and was unchanged by perfusion with depolarizing high [K<sup>+</sup>] solution (9.7 \u00b1 1\u2009Hz at 15\u201316\u2009s and 9.3 \u00b1 0.8\u2009Hz at 29\u201330\u2009s; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). For comparison cilia beat frequency during continuous perfusion of standard external solution (aCSF 3\u2009K<sup>+</sup>) was 9.8 \u00b1 1\u2009Hz (0\u20131\u2009s), 10 \u00b1 1\u2009Hz (15\u201316\u2009s), and 10 \u00b1 1\u2009Hz (29\u201330\u2009s). Kymographs depicting the beat cycles of individual cilia additionally revealed that cilia smoothly transitioned from a forward to a backward stroke independent of external [K<sup>+</sup>] (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> modification of cilia function in mammalian ependymal cells is quite distinct from that in protists (<a href=\"#bib26\">Inaba, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Satir and Christensen, 2007</a>). While beat reversal, and changes in waveform critically depend on the activity of ciliary Ca<sub>V</sub> channels in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> and <i>Paramecium</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fujiu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kung and Naito, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Matsuda et al., 1998</a>), we found little evidence linking Ca<sup>2+</sup> in ependymal cell bodies or motile cilia to their function. Moreover, unlike primary cilia in which specialized ciliary channels (polycystins) predominate (<a href=\"#bib8\">DeCaen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Delling et al., 2013</a>), we found that Ca<sub>V</sub> channels in the cell body primarily determine changes in motile cilia [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Although we could not accurately quantify the relative Ca<sub>V</sub> channel densities in motile cilia compared to the cell body or test the possibility of non-uniform channel distribution along the cilium shaft, these channels were not enriched at the ciliary tip. Whether sparsely ciliated cells are less well differentiated or represent a subclass of ciliated ependymal cells is unclear, but the low abundance of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels revealed by patch clamping of these cilia is consistent with a cytoplasmic control of ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in imaging experiments from multiciliated cells. We thus conclude that ependymal cilia have distinct electrical properties as compared to flagella (cilia) that are used for locomotion in mammalian sperm (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kirichok et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Miki and Clapham, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Qi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ren et al., 2001</a>) and protists (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beck and Uhl, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dunlap, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fujiu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kung and Naito, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Matsuda et al., 1998</a>)."

Thus, a cellular response would promote simultaneous signaling to all cilia, perhaps slowly entraining the cilia and enabling signal propagation to neighboring cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sanderson et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schmid and Salathe, 2011</a>). Unlike primary cilia, ependymal cilia had only slightly elevated resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], thus enabling smaller changes in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> to equilibrate within cilia. Indeed, membrane depolarization triggered activation of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels, which resulted in a robust change in ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. While we could not differentiate the onset of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0response in the cilium from that in the cell body, the results suggest that ciliary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] follows cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]."

ATP-activated P2X7 receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx made a minor contribution to the ATP-induced increase in beating frequency of ependymal cilia, while activation of the adenosine A2B receptor made a more significant change, perhaps via slower G protein-dependent pathways (<a href=\"#bib17\">Genzen et al., 2009b</a>). In contrast, we observed that membrane depolarization, or application of ATP, did not significantly alter ependymal motile cilia function. We observed only a slight decrease in bead velocity in the lateral ventricles of acute brain slices that correlated with depolarization and Ca<sub>V</sub> channel activation. Since we did not detect a change in ciliary beating frequency in in vitro cultures of ependymal cells, we suspect that coupling to other cell types or factors mediates the observed reduction. The variability in velocities of individual beads, however, leads us to question the physiological relevance of the observed changes. Finally, although previous studies suggest that ependymal cell differentiation in vitro reflects in vivo conditions (i.e. postnatal maturation into multiciliated cells [<a href=\"#bib14\">El Zein et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Guirao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Spassky et al., 2005</a>]), we cannot exclude the possibility of altered channel expression.

Here we have examined the electrophysiological and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling properties of motile cilia in ependymal cells.

First, membrane potential and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] closely follow those in the cytoplasm. This stems naturally from a relative paucity of ion channels in the cilia compared to the nonselective channels in primary cilia (<a href=\"#bib8\">DeCaen et al., 2013</a>). Second, voltage-dependent calcium channels change [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the cytoplasm that propagates readily into the motile cilia, but only marginally alters beat frequency or fluid flow. These findings, although they cannot necessarily be generalized to all motile cilia, suggest that Ca<sub>V</sub> channels in ependymal cells primarily serve other secretory or differentiation roles in the cell body."

Digitonin was added at a final concentration of 16 \u03bcM to permeabilize the cells and images were acquired with a FluoView1000 confocal microscope (Olympus) for multiple cells after a 5\u2009min permeabilization. The standard solution contained (in mM): 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and CaCl<sub>2</sub>; pH 7.3 with NaOH. MaxChelator (maxchelator.stanford.edu) was used to calculate the total CaCl<sub>2</sub> needed to obtain the desired free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. The acquisition parameters were initially established for GCaMP6s and mCherry fluorescence in the solution containing the highest free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and then held constant across experiments. Non-sequential scan mode was chosen to avoid offsets in the position of beating cilia (basal conditions). Bleed-through of GCaMP6 fluorescence emission into the Cherry signal was subtracted as explained below. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (NIH) and data plotted using Origin (OriginLab). Images were background-subtracted and a mask created by thresholding the Cherry channel to exclude pixels with no sensor fluorescence. The Cherry mask was then applied to the images with GCaMP6s fluorescence and the resulting image divided by the background-subtracted image of the Cherry channel to obtain ratioed images. Saturated points were subtracted by thresholding the Cherry channel before background subtraction and multiplying it by the ratio image. The mean ratio of F_GCaMP6s and F_mCherry for various free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was measured by averaging the fluorescence intensity of all motile cilia per cell, of multiple cells. To correct for bleed-through, images of HEK293 cells expressing GCaMP6s (in pcDNA3.1) were acquired upon stimulation with 2 \u03bcM ionomycin in varying external CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations, using the identical acquisition settings as for the acquisition of the calibration curve. Images were background-subtracted and ROIs selected in the cytoplasmic compartment. The GCaMP6s fluorescence was plotted as a function of mCherry fluorescence and the data points fitted linearly. The resulting slope accounts for the bleed-through and was subtracted using the following formula: A<sub>c</sub> = F_GCaMP6s/F_mCherry \u2013 \u03b1GCaMP6s, where A<sub>c</sub> is the corrected average ratio and \u03b1GCaMP6s is the slope of the fit. The corrected ratios were then plotted as a function of free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and the data points fitted with the Hill equation. The basal free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in motile cilia was calculated from the average of the corrected fluorescence ratio in standard bath solution (aCSF) and the parameters from the Hill fit of the calibration curve."

Some slices were perfused with beads in aCSF control solution and, <i>e.g.</i>, aCSF 70\u2009K<sup>+</sup>, and slices washed for 2\u2009min with aCSF between recordings. In experiments with nimodipine, slices were perfused for 2\u2009min with aCSF plus nimodipine (10 \u03bcM) prior to bead perfusion in aCSF 70\u2009K<sup>+</sup> plus nimodipine. Bead velocities were analyzed using the ImageJ manual tracking plugin. Only beads that could be tracked for at least 4 frames were included in the analysis."

Ependymal cell cultures were derived from a transgenic <i>Arl13B-EGFP<sup>tg</sup></i> mouse pup and tissue collected from a 2 week-old heterozygous <i>Arl13B-EGFP<sup>tg</sup></i> male. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Superscript III (Life Technologies). The reverse transcriptase was omitted from the cDNA synthesis reaction in controls for cultured ependymal cells. PCR products were amplified with Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) using a touchdown PCR protocol with decreasing annealing temperatures (3 cycles at 68, 65, and 62 degrees; and 25 cycles at 58 degrees). The following intron-spanning primers were used:"

In contrast to those of whole cell plasma membranes, which have been studied for &gt;70 years, the biophysical properties of organelle membranes are generally very little understood, partially because of the difficulty of applying electrophysiological recording techniques. The authors overcame the difficulty by developing a quite neat set of tools, and painstakingly recorded whole-cilium currents from ependymal cells. Two of the major findings in the paper are quite surprising. First, the biophysical properties of the motile cilia are intriguingly very different from those of primary cilia that the authors characterized before. For example, the motile cilia do not seem to have the PKDL Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels abundantly present in primary cilia. In fact, the motile cilia don't seem to have significant number of channels at all. The apparent lack of major ion channels in the cilia is consistent with the authors' finding of tight electrical and chemical (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-diffusion) coupling between the cilia and cell body. Second, the beating of the cilia do not seem to be affected by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increases. This again is quite surprising given that most of us would expect the beating of 9+2 -structured cilia to be like that of e.g. the flagella of sperm cells found in both vertebrates and invertebrates and to be highly influenced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>."

Many TRP channels, including PKD2-L1 channels conduct Ba<sup>2+</sup> (DeCaen et al., 2013). If PKD2-L1 channels were enriched in motile cilia as they are in primary cilia, we should have observed single channel openings at hyperpolarized potentials (we did not). If the reviewer is referring to the possibility that K<sup>+</sup> channels may be blocked in presence of Ba<sup>2+</sup>, we used K<sup>+</sup>- and Na<sup>+</sup>-based pipette solutions in some experiments and occasionally observed single channel openings, indicating the presence of other ion channels in motile cilia. While we have not extensively tested the presence of ligand-gated ion channels such as P2X7 receptors, the small number of patches in which we observed single channel openings (with different pipette solutions) suggests that motile cilia have many fewer ion channels than primary cilia. <i>2) <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F and 1G</a>, it's surprising that the only currents (presumably from whole cell and whole cilium) are the \"leak-like\" K<sup>+</sup> currents.

While flufenamic acid and other fenamates reversibly block gap junctions (ependymal cells grow in a monolayer), they also modulate (i.e. activate/inhibit) many ion channels (Harks et al., 2001; Guinamard et al., 2013).

The main obstacles for patch clamping motile cilia are visualization, motility and multiciliation. Approaching a heavily ciliated cell with the patch pipette and applying light suction typically attracted more than one cilium to the pipette tip preventing seal formation on a single cilium. While we cannot exclude the possibility that cilia of sparsely ciliated cells present a subclass of cilia, we show that they retain motility and stain positive for a central pair marker, Spag6. We also carried out new experiments in which we compared the beat frequencies of cilia of in vitro cultured sparsely- and multiciliated ependymal cells. The cilia beat frequency of sparsely ciliated cells is ~2-3 fold less than that of multiciliated cells \u2013 we now state this in the text. Many groups have shown that extracellular hydrodynamic forces synchronize the movement of individual motile cilia in the group into metachronal waves. Cilia of sparsely ciliated cells experience different fluid dynamics (reduced flow) as compared to multiciliated cells, which likely affects their beat coordination and motility (Guirao & Joanny 2007, Guirao et al., 2010)."
