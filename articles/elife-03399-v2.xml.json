The PCM expands dramatically as cells enter mitosis, but it is unclear how this occurs. In this study, we show that the centriole protein Asl initiates the recruitment of DSpd-2 and Cnn to mother centrioles; both proteins then assemble into co-dependent scaffold-like structures that spread outwards from the mother centriole and recruit most, if not all, other PCM components. In the absence of either DSpd-2 or Cnn, mitotic PCM assembly is diminished; in the absence of both proteins, it appears to be abolished. We show that DSpd-2 helps incorporate Cnn into the PCM and that Cnn then helps maintain DSpd-2 within the PCM, creating a positive feedback loop that promotes robust PCM expansion around the mother centriole during mitosis. These observations suggest a surprisingly simple mechanism of mitotic PCM assembly in flies."

The PCM expands dramatically as cells enter mitosis, but it is unclear how this occurs. In this study, we show that the centriole protein Asl initiates the recruitment of DSpd-2 and Cnn to mother centrioles; both proteins then assemble into co-dependent scaffold-like structures that spread outwards from the mother centriole and recruit most, if not all, other PCM components. In the absence of either DSpd-2 or Cnn, mitotic PCM assembly is diminished; in the absence of both proteins, it appears to be abolished. We show that DSpd-2 helps incorporate Cnn into the PCM and that Cnn then helps maintain DSpd-2 within the PCM, creating a positive feedback loop that promotes robust PCM expansion around the mother centriole during mitosis. These observations suggest a surprisingly simple mechanism of mitotic PCM assembly in flies."

We reasoned that such a scaffold might also be assembled from the inside out. To identify such a protein(s), we analyzed the dynamic behaviour of the eight <i>Drosophila</i> centrosomal proteins that, in addition to Cnn, have been most strongly implicated in mitotic PCM recruitment: Asl, Sas-4, D-PLP, DSpd-2, \u03b3-tubulin, DGp71WD, Polo, and Aurora A. We found that only DSpd-2 behaves like Cnn, as it incorporates into the PCM close to the centrioles and then spreads slowly outward to form a scaffold-like structure that recruits other PCM components. Importantly, in the absence of either DSpd-2 or Cnn, PCM recruitment is diminished, but in the absence of both proteins, it is abolished. We show that Asl appears to initiate the recruitment of DSpd-2 and Cnn exclusively to the mother centrioles; DSpd-2 then helps to recruit more Cnn, while Cnn helps to maintain DSpd-2 within the PCM, thus creating a positive feedback loop that promotes the scaffold assembly. Thus, mitotic PCM assembly appears to be a surprisingly simple process in flies: Asl initiates the recruitment of Spd-2 and Cnn to mother centrioles, and these proteins then assemble into scaffolds that spread out from the mother centriole and form a platform upon which most, if not all, other PCM proteins ultimately assemble."

Note also that GFP-Cnn and DSpd-2-GFP are overexpressed and underexpressed, respectively, but both display a similar dynamic behaviour (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2M,N</a>), again suggesting that the expression level of a GFP-fusion protein does not significantly affect the mode in which it is incorporated into the PCM. We have not been able to analyze the relative expression level of Polo-GFP, as we were unable to get anti-Polo antibodies to work on Western blots."

It can be seen, however, that the PCM fraction of D-PLP shows no sign of outward movement through the PCM (<b>L</b>). The normalized recovery profiles of GFP-Cnn (<b>N</b>) are narrower than the pre-bleached profile and spread outwards over time, reflecting the fact that Cnn molecules are initially incorporated only in the centre of the PCM and then move slowly outward (<a href=\"#bib18\">Conduit et al., 2014</a>)."

To test if this structure was really the source of the centrosomal DSpd-2 and Cnn, we modified our 3D-SIM system to enable us (to our knowledge for the first time) to combine 3D-SIM with FRAP (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). This analysis revealed that after photobleaching DSpd-2-GFP fluorescence initially recovered in a toroidal pattern (t = 30 s, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and then moved slowly outwards on dynamic projections (t = 120 s to t = 450 s, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2A</a>). The initial toroidal distribution was very similar to that previously reported for Asl, one of the several proteins that form a toroid specifically around the mother centriole (<a href=\"#bib53\">Mennella et al., 2013</a>) (compare the recovering DSpd-2-GFP signal at t = 30 s in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> to the unbleached Asl-GFP signal shown in the inset; also compare the average profile of Asl-GFP to the average initial recovery profile of DSpd-2-GFP, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Thus, DSpd-2-GFP is initially incorporated into the PCM by binding sites that are tightly concentrated around only one of the two centrioles\u2014almost certainly the mother\u2014and the spatial distribution of these sites extensively overlaps with the distribution of Asl."

The centriole proteins DSas-4, Asl, and D-PLP all localize in a toroid pattern around mother centrioles (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fu and Glover, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Mennella et al., 2012</a>) and have all been implicated in PCM recruitment, suggesting that they could help recruit DSpd-2. Because DSas-4 and Asl mutants lack centrioles (<a href=\"#bib5\">Basto et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blachon et al., 2008</a>), we tested this possibility by inhibiting the function of these proteins in embryos using antibody-injection (<a href=\"#bib16\">Conduit et al., 2010</a>). Anti-Asl antibodies bound to centrosomes and reduced the rate of DSpd-2-GFP incorporation into the PCM by \u223c75%, whereas anti-DSas-4 and anti-D-PLP antibodies had little effect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)\u2014although these antibodies bound to centrioles/centrosomes and at least partially disrupted the function of their cognate protein (<a href=\"#bib4\">Basto et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Novak et al., 2014</a>; unpublished data). These observations are consistent with the previous finding that Asl is required for the centrosomal localization of DSpd-2 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Giansanti et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, our yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) analysis revealed several strong direct interactions between Asl and DSpd-2 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). Although we cannot be certain that Asl and DSpd-2 interact directly in vivo, collectively our data indicate that Asl has an important, and potentially direct, role in recruiting DSpd-2 to mother centrioles in fly embryos."

We noticed, however, that the distribution of DSpd-2-GFP, but not Asl-GFP, around the mother centriole closely matched the distribution of the initial binding sites for GFP-Cnn, as revealed by our 3D-SIM FRAP experiments (compare the recovering GFP-Cnn signal at t = 60 s in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> to the unbleached DSpd-2-GFP signal at t = \u221230 s in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; also compare the average profile of DSpd-2-GFP to the average initial recovery profile of GFP-Cnn, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Remarkably, however, centrosome maturation appeared to be abolished in the mitotic brain cells lacking both Cnn and DSpd-2 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D,H</a>). This effect was specific to the loss of both Cnn and DSpd-2, as centrosomes in mitotic cells lacking either Cnn or DSpd-2 that also lacked the abundant PCM protein D-TACC could still partially mature (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Remarkably, we show here that the assembly of the mitotic PCM in flies appears to depend on just two proteins, Cnn and DSpd-2. Both proteins appear to form scaffolds that initially assemble around the mother centriole and then spread outward, forming a dynamic platform upon which most, if not all, other PCM proteins ultimately assemble. DSpd-2 and Cnn partially depend on each other for their centrosomal localization, and both proteins are required to ensure robust centrosome maturation. In the absence of one of these proteins, reduced levels of the other protein still localize around the centrioles and can support the partial assembly of the mitotic PCM. In the absence of both the proteins, mitotic PCM assembly appears to be abolished (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

Our results strongly suggest that in fly embryos Asl initially helps recruit DSpd-2 to centrioles and DSpd-2 then helps to recruit Cnn. Cnn does not appear to be required to recruit either Asl or DSpd-2 to centrosomes, but it is required to properly maintain DSpd-2 within the PCM. We speculate that this interaction between DSpd-2 and Cnn creates a positive feedback loop that drives the dramatic expansion of the PCM scaffold around mother centrioles during mitosis (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Although, we have identified direct interactions between Asl and DSpd-2 and between DSpd-2 and Cnn by Y2H, and the endogenous proteins can all co-immunoprecipitate with one another in fly embryo extracts (<a href=\"#bib16\">Conduit et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011</a>), we stress that we cannot be certain that these interactions are direct in vivo."

A top view of the mother centriole is shown surrounded by a layer of Asl (grey); solid arrows represent recruiting interactions, dotted arrows represent maintaining interactions. Arrow thickness reflects the relative strength of the recruitment or maintenance, and the size of the text reflects the amount of protein localized at centrosomes. In WT cells (<b>A</b>), Asl has an important role in recruiting DSpd-2 to centrosomes, which in turn has an important role in recruiting Cnn; Cnn then has an important role in maintaining DSpd-2 at centrosomes. Thus, a positive feedback loop is generated where increasing amounts of DSpd-2 can recruit increasing amounts of Cnn, which can then maintain increasing amounts of DSpd-2. DSpd-2 and Cnn both independently recruit other PCM components (red), which themselves help support the PCM structure and can recruit further PCM components. In the absence of Cnn (<b>B</b>), Asl can still recruit DSpd-2 normally, but DSpd-2 cannot efficiently accumulate around the centrioles. The reduced levels of DSpd-2 recruit reduced levels of PCM. In the absence of DSpd-2 (<b>C</b>), an alternative pathway recruits reduced levels of Cnn. This pathway most likely involves Asl (as indicated here), as inhibiting Asl reduces the rate of Cnn incorporation into the PCM (<a href=\"#bib16\">Conduit et al., 2010</a>) and Asl and Cnn appear to weakly interact in a Y2H analysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>); other pathways, however, could also be involved. The reduced levels of Cnn recruit reduced levels of PCM. In the absence of Cnn and DSpd-2 (<b>D</b>), no mitotic PCM can be assembled."

Asl is an attractive candidate as anti-Asl antibodies perturb Cnn recruitment to centrioles (<a href=\"#bib16\">Conduit et al., 2010</a>) (although this could be an indirect consequence of their effect on DSpd-2 recruitment), and Asl and Cnn interact in our Y2H analysis. Moreover, human Cep152/Asl has a role in the centrosomal recruitment of human Cdk5Rap2/Cnn (<a href=\"#bib24\">Firat-Karalar et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, in flies this alternative pathway appears to be stronger in larval brain cells than in eggs/embryos: in the absence of DSpd-2, Cnn levels are reduced by only \u223c35% in brains (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>) but by \u223c80% in eggs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

For Cnn, there is strong data indicating that scaffold assembly is regulated by phosphorylation. Cnn contains a phospho-regulated multimerization (PReM) domain that is phosphorylated by Polo/Plk1 in vitro and at centrosomes during mitosis in vivo (<a href=\"#bib78\">Dobbelaere et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Conduit et al., 2014</a>). Mimicking phosphorylation allows the PReM domain to multimerize in vitro and Cnn to spontaneously assemble into cytosolic scaffolds in vivo that can organize MTs. Conversely, ablating phosphorylation does not interfere with Cnn recruitment to centrioles, but inhibits Cnn scaffold assembly (<a href=\"#bib17\">Conduit et al., 2014</a>). We speculate that, like Cnn, DSpd-2 can assemble into a scaffold and that this assembly is regulated in vivo so that it only occurs around mother centrioles. It remains unclear, however, whether DSpd-2 itself can form a scaffold, or whether it requires other proteins to do so."

Both proteins incorporate into the PCM from the inside out, and are in constant flux, as the molecules that move slowly outward away from the centrioles are replaced by newly incorporated molecules close to the centriole surface (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). This inside out assembly is likely to have important consequences, as it means that the events close to the centriole surface, rather than at the periphery of the PCM, can ultimately regulate mitotic PCM assembly. This may be particularly important in cells where centrioles organise centrosomes of different sizes, as is the case in certain asymmetrically dividing stem/progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lesage et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Nigg and Stearns, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Pelletier and Yamashita, 2012</a>). Fly neural stem cells, for example, use centrosome size asymmetry to ensure robust asymmetric division (<a href=\"#bib64\">Rebollo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Rusan and Peifer, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Januschke et al., 2013</a>), and there is strong evidence that new and old mother centrioles differentially regulate the rate of Cnn incorporation in these cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Conduit and Raff, 2010</a>). Moreover, mutations in human Cdk5Rap2/Cnn have been implicated in microcephaly (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bond et al., 2005</a>), a pathology linked to a failure in neural progenitor cell proliferation, although the precise reason for this is unclear (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bond and Woods, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Megraw et al., 2011</a>)."

These centriolar fibrils, however, cannot explain how centrioles organize such a vastly expanded PCM matrix during mitosis, and D-PLP appears to have an important, but more minor, role in mitotic PCM assembly in vivo (<a href=\"#bib48\">Martinez-Campos et al., 2004</a>). Nevertheless, proteins like D-PLP will certainly help recruit other PCM proteins and help form structural links within the PCM, thus strengthening the mitotic PCM matrix. The important distinction is that, in flies at least, most proteins, including the PCM fraction of D-PLP, are recruited into the PCM by an underlying PCM scaffold, whereas DSpd-2 and Cnn appear to form this scaffold."

Photobleaching was carried out in S phase, which is when mitotic PCM is most actively recruited in these rapidly cycling embryos. We used ImageJ to calculate the fluorescence profile of each centrosome at each time-point. We first scaled the images so that each pixel was split into 25 (5 \u00d7 5) pixels in order to increase the resolution of our radial profiling. We then calculated the centre of mass of the centrosome by thresholding the image and running the \u2018analyze particles\u2019 (centre of mass) macro on the most central Z plane of the centrosome. We then centred concentric rings (spaced at 0.028 \u03bcm and spanning across 3.02 \u03bcm) on this centre and measured the average fluorescence around each ring (radial profiling). After subtracting the average cytosolic signal and normalising, so the peak intensity of the pre-bleached image was equal to 1, we mirrored the profiles to show a full symmetric centrosomal profile. For each time-point, an average distribution from at least 10 centrosomes was calculated."

These data are solid but the analysis of how these proteins are recruited is more tenuous. In particular the proposed pathway that Asl recruits D-Spd2, which forms a scaffold that recruits CNN, with partial feedback between D-Spd2 and CNN, is only one possible interpretation of the data and stronger evidence is required to make this conclusion.

Moreover, the endogenous proteins all co-immunoprecipitate from embryo extracts (<a href=\"#bib16\">Conduit et al., 2010</a>) and we can detect strong direct interactions between Asl and DSpd-2 and between DSpd-2 and Cnn in Y2H assays.

Quantifying this in a meaningful way is problematic as these 3D-SIM images are all calculated reconstructions from multiple image stacks that, for technical reasons, have to be acquired sequentially (red first then green); the PCM is rapidly moving in these embryos making voxel by voxel comparisons unreliable, particularly in the crowded environment of the centrosome. What we think is clear from our analysis is that there is substantial (but not complete) overlap between the distributions of DSpd-2 and Cnn (at least by eyeball) in the central region of the PCM, but that Cnn strongly extends out into the more peripheral regions, where DSpd-2 is much weaker (although there is usually some DSpd-2 detectable in the peripheral regions that contain Cnn). We now explain this more clearly, and provide an additional <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a> that shows examples of line plots through a centrosome that we hope illustrate these points in a semi-quantitative manner (although we are not big fans of this type of analysis as they can be very subjective)."
