Contrary to this paradigm, cellulosomal cohesin-dockerin (Coh-Doc) pairs are believed to interact through redundant dual binding modes consisting of two distinct conformations. Here, we combined site-directed mutagenesis and single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) to study the unbinding of Coh:Doc complexes under force. We designed Doc mutations to knock out each binding mode, and compared their single-molecule unfolding patterns as they were dissociated from Coh using an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever. Although average bulk measurements were unable to resolve the differences in Doc binding modes due to the similarity of the interactions, with a single-molecule method we were able to discriminate the two modes based on distinct differences in their mechanical properties. We conclude that under native conditions wild-type Doc from <i>Clostridium thermocellum</i> exocellulase Cel48S populates both binding modes with similar probabilities. Given the vast number of Doc domains with predicteddual binding modes across multiple bacterial species, our approach opens up newpossibilities for understanding assembly and catalytic properties of a broadrange of multi-enzyme complexes."

Contrary to this paradigm, cellulosomal cohesin-dockerin (Coh-Doc) pairs are believed to interact through redundant dual binding modes consisting of two distinct conformations. Here, we combined site-directed mutagenesis and single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) to study the unbinding of Coh:Doc complexes under force. We designed Doc mutations to knock out each binding mode, and compared their single-molecule unfolding patterns as they were dissociated from Coh using an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever. Although average bulk measurements were unable to resolve the differences in Doc binding modes due to the similarity of the interactions, with a single-molecule method we were able to discriminate the two modes based on distinct differences in their mechanical properties. We conclude that under native conditions wild-type Doc from <i>Clostridium thermocellum</i> exocellulase Cel48S populates both binding modes with similar probabilities. Given the vast number of Doc domains with predicteddual binding modes across multiple bacterial species, our approach opens up newpossibilities for understanding assembly and catalytic properties of a broadrange of multi-enzyme complexes."

It has been difficult to investigate the populations of these different configurations because most experimental techniques investigating protein binding take average measurements from many molecules at once. As the binding modes are extremely similar, these methods have been unable to distinguish between the two cohesin-dockerin binding configurations without introducing mutations, in part because these configurations are very similar to each other."

This technique applies a force that separates, or \u2018unbinds\u2019, cohesin and dockerin, by pulling individual complexes of the two binding partners apart with a nanoscale probe. In the experiments, <i>E. coli</i> bacteria were made to produce mutant versions of dockerin that can only bind to cohesin in one orientation. This allowed each binding configuration to be studied individually. The results of these experiments revealed the mechanical unbinding patterns of each cohesin-dockerin configuration, and showed that it is possible to use these patterns to distinguish between the two configurations. A complimentary set of experiments revealed that wild-type (non-mutated) cohesin-dockerin complexes occupy both configurations in approximately equal amounts, and do not switch modes once bound."

These enzyme complexes incorporate catalytic domains, carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs), cohesin:dockerin (Coh:Doc) pairs, and other conserved features (<a href=\"#bib14\">Demain et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bayer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Schwarz, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">B\u00e9guin and Aubert, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Smith and Bayer, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fontes and Gilbert, 2010</a>). A central attribute of cellulosome assembly is the conserved ~75 amino acid type-I Doc domain typically found at the C-terminus of cellulosomal catalytic domains. The highly conserved consensus Doc sequence from <i>Clostridium thermocellum (Ct</i>) is shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. Dockerins guide attachment of enzymes into the networks by binding strongly to conserved Coh domains organized within non-catalytic poly (Coh) scaffolds. In addition to their nanomolar binding affinities, many archetypal Coh:Doc pairs are thought to exhibit dual binding modes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carvalho et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pinheiro et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Currie et al., 2012</a>). The bound Doc domain can adopt two possible orientations that differ by ~180\u00b0 rotation on the Coh surface, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>. The two binding modes originate from duplicated F-hand sequence motifs, a conserved structural feature found among type-I dockerins (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pag\u00e8s et al., 1997</a>). The duplicated F-hand motifs resemble EF-hands found in eukaryotic calcium binding proteins (e.g., calmodulin), and provide internal sequence and structural symmetry to Doc domains. Rotating Doc by ~180\u00b0 with respect to Coh (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>) results in an alternatively bound complex with similarly high affinity involving the same residues on Coh recognizing mirrored residues within Doc. The dual binding mode is thought to increase the conformational space available to densely packed enzymes on protein scaffolds, and to facilitate substrate recognition by catalytic domains within cellulosomal networks (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bayer et al., 2004</a>). From an evolutionary perspective, the dual binding mode confers robustness against loss-of-function mutations, while allowing mutations within Doc to explore inter-bacterial species cohesin-binding promiscuity in cellulosome-producing microbial communities. Coh:Doc interactions and dual binding modes are therefore important in the context of cellulose degradation by cellulosome-producing anaerobic bacterial communities."

                        "text": "However, direct experimental observation of the dual binding modes for wild-type Doc has thus far proven challenging. Ensemble average bulk biochemical assays (e.g., surface plasmon resonance, calorimetry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) are of limited use in resolving binding mode populations, particularly when the binding modes are of equal thermodynamic affinity. Crystallography is challenging because the complex does not adopt a unique molecular conformation, but rather exhibits a mixture of two conformations thereby hindering crystal growth. Structural data on the dual binding mode have typically been collected using a mutagenesis approach, where one of the binding modes was destabilized by mutating key recognition elements (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carvalho et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pinheiro et al., 2008</a>). This approach, however, while resolving the structures of each bound complex, cannot determine if one binding mode is dominant for wild-type Doc, or if that dominance is species or sequence dependent. Coarse grained molecular dynamics has also predicted dual modes of interaction between Coh and Doc (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hall and Sansom, 2009</a>), but direct experimental evidence of both binding modes for wild-type Doc has remained elusive. Improved fundamental understanding of the dual binding mode could shed light onto the molecular mechanisms by which these multi-enzyme complexes self-assemble and achieve synergistic conformations, as well as provide a new approach to designing systems for protein nanoassembly (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kufer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">2008</a>)."

We demonstrate that specific unfolding/unbinding trajectories of individually bound Coh:Doc complexes are characteristic of the binding modes. To validate our approach, we produced Doc mutants that exhibited a preferred binding mode. We performed single-molecule pulling experiments on bound Coh:mutant Doc complexes and observed a strong bias in the probability of two clearly distinguishable unfolding patterns, termed \u2018single\u2019 and \u2018double\u2019 rupture types for each binding mode mutant. We further probed the unbinding mechanism of the double rupture events using poly (Gly-Ser) inserts to add amino acid sequence length to specific sections of Doc as a means to identify which portions of Doc unfolded. Finally, we used the inherent differences in mechanical stability of each binding mode, and the effects these differences had on the unfolding force distributions of an adjacent domain, to directly observe and quantify binding mode populations for wild-type Doc."

To design quadruple mutants, we noted that recent structural work reported a set of <i>Ct</i>-Doc domains that differ from the canonical duplicated Ser-Thr sequences. These non-canonical Docs were found to exhibit only a single binding mode (<a href=\"#bib4\">Br\u00e1s et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Pinheiro et al., 2009</a>). In one of these non-canonical Doc domains, an Asp-Glu pair was found in place of Ser-Thr. Since the Coh surface is negatively charged, we postulated that including Asp-Glu in place of Ser-Thr within one of the F-hands could be used to effectively knock out a given binding mode for our canonical Doc. Additionally, we incorporated double alanine mutations to replace the conserved Lys-18 Arg-19 residues of a given F-hand motif, further destabilizing a targeted binding mode. Q1 refers to a quadruple mutant where helix 1 has been modified at four positions (i.e. S11D-T12E-K18A-R19A).

The site-specific attachment chemistry used here was precisely defined by the chosen residue of immobilization, ensuring the same loading geometry was used on the complex for each and every data trace. After formation of the Coh:Doc complex, the cantilever was retracted at a constant speed that ranged from 200 to 3200 nm/s while the force was monitored by optical cantilever deflection.

The contour length increment between the two double event peaks was found to be ~8 nm, that is, 8 nm of hidden contour length was added to the biopolymer during a sub-step of Doc unbinding (see \u2018Discussion\u2019). The 8-nm contour length increment was also observed in complementary experiments employing other fusion domains: xylanase was swapped for an sfGFP domain and CBM was swapped out for an iLOV domain. In these new fusions, the 8 nm Doc increment was still observed, indicating it was not caused by a specific fusion domain.

Although the ratios of single to double peaks were nearly identical between wild-type and Q3, differences in the relative force between the first and second peaks differentiated wild-type and Q3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Double peaks for the Q3 mutant were more likely to show a shielded behavior, where the second peak was lower in force than the first peak by ~10%. Although the Q3 mutant showed the same single vs. double event probability as wild-type, the double events for Q3 were distinguishable from those of the wild-type based on this observed decrease in the rupture force of the second peak. The second barrier of the double events was therefore weaker in Q3 than for wild-type. This weaker 2<sup>nd</sup> double peak for the Q3 mutant combined with similar single/double peak ratios as wild-type leads us to believe that the number of double peaks is being underestimated systematically for the Q3 mutant. Generally, each binding mode still allows for the occurrence of a single event (albeit with different likelihood), in which the whole Doc domain unbinds without an additional unfolding substep. Since the second and final energy barrier for complex dissociation is weaker than the first for the Q3 mutant, the probability for the molecule to pass both barriers simultaneously is increased, thus resulting in a higher percentage of single events."

Amino acid insert sequences have previously been used to probe length increments in AFM force spectroscopy experiments (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bertz and Rief, 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carrion-Vazquez et al., 1999</a>). By adding additional amino acids to the polypeptide chain at a particular location, insert sequences increase the gain in contour length following unfolding of a subdomain in a predictable way. Any change in the observed length increment can be pinpointed to the position in the molecule where the unfolding event occurs. In this case, we engineered flexible (GS)<sub>8</sub> insert sequences directly into wild-type Doc between helices 1 and 2, in a flexible loop that was not expected to interfere with either of the two binding modes. Structural homology models (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) of the wild-type Doc and (GS)<sub>8</sub> insert sequence were calculated using the Phyre server (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kelley and Sternberg, 2009</a>). If the 8-nm contour length increment was caused by sequential unbinding of Doc helices 1 and 3 in wild-type Doc, then double peaks for the poly (GS) constructs should show an increase in the double peak contour length increment. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C and D</a>, the contour length histogram for (GS)<sub>8</sub> Doc was indistinguishable from the wild-type Doc. No additional contour length was gained due to additional amino acids inserted between Doc helices 1 and 2. Since the Doc was anchored to the glass slide through an N-terminal xylanase domain, this result indicated that the unfolding event responsible for the 8-nm length increment must be located upstream (i.e. N-terminal) from the site of the (GS)<sub>8</sub>-insert. This result suggested that unfolding of calcium binding loop 1 and helix 1 in Doc was the source of the 8-nm length increment."

Also iLOV has an unfolding force distribution that lies in a similar range as the Coh:Doc complex dissociation single and double peaks, allowing for effective biasing of the iLOV unfolding force distributions by the inherent stability difference between single and double event peaks. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> shows characteristic single and double event curves containing iLOV unfolding (36-nm contour length increment) followed by Coh:Doc rupture as a single or double event. The rupture force distributions of the single and double event (second peak) ruptures are shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>. The most probable rupture force for single events was ~104 pN, while for double events this value was ~140 pN at a pulling speed of 800 nm/s. We next calculated the unfolding force distributions of the iLOV domain for curves that terminated with single events or double events. If the Coh:Doc complex ruptured before iLOV unfolding was observed, the curve was eliminated from the dataset because it lacked a fingerprint domain length increment. This criterion for inclusion in the dataset results in a biasing of the iLOV unfolding forces, since the maximum of the fingerprint unfolding force distribution that can be observed must lie below that of the Coh:Doc complex. The fact that we observed a downward shift in the iLOV unfolding forces (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) for curves that terminated in the less mechanically stable single rupture event is confirmation that the single- and double-event peaks arise from separate bound conformations. Each mode has a distinct mechanical stability and energy landscape that is set at the time of receptor-ligand binding, that is once bound, the conformation of the complex does not change. If single- and double-event unbinding patterns were simply two competing pathways out of the same bound state, then the downward shift in rupture force distribution would not be observed for the iLOV unfolding forces. Although this shift in rupture force distributions is comparatively subtle, it can be observed accurately with high statistical significance. We note that the datasets for both binding modes were measured with the same cantilever throughout the runtime of the whole experiment. Calibration and drift issues therefore did not interfere with the required accuracy."

The remaining possibility that the 8 nm is located within the Coh domain is also not likely since the barrel-like structure of the Coh is known to be mechanically highly stable (<a href=\"#bib46\">Valbuena et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib20\">Hoffmann et al., 2013</a>). Also, if the 8-nm length increment were due to partial Coh unfolding, the Q1 and Q3 mutants would not be expected to affect the single/double peak ratio or force differences between the double event peaks as was observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B, C</a>). The GS-insert data suggest the 8-nm length increment is located within Doc, upstream (N-terminal) from the GS-insert site implicating calcium loop 1 and helix 1 in this unfolding event."

Based on a length per stretched amino acid of 0.4 nm, the expected contour length for unfolding the Doc domain up to this position would be 7.6 nm, in good agreement with the measured value of 8 nm within experimental error. A portion of the N-terminal calcium binding loop (i.e. residues S11-T12) is involved in binding to D39 in Coh. The first peak of the double events is attributed to breakage of this interaction and simultaneous unfolding of calcium loop 1 and alpha helix 1 up to the Lys-Arg pair at sequence positions 18 and 19. Another contributing factor is the intramolecular clasp that has been identified as a stabilizing mechanism among similar type-I Doc domains (<a href=\"#bib42\">Slutzki et al., 2013</a>). A recent NMR structural study (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2014</a>) on the same wild-type Doc used in this work confirmed a hydrophobic ring-stacking interaction between Tyr-5 and Pro-66. Confirmation of this clasp motif by NMR means the head and tail of the Doc are bound together, additionally stabilizing the barrier that is overcome in the first of the double event peaks. In this scenario, subsequent to breaking the interactions between the calcium binding loop and Coh, disrupting the intramolecular clasp and unfolding the N-terminal loop-helix motif, the remaining bound residues including Lys-18, Arg-19, Lys-50, Leu-54, and Lys-55 stay bound to Coh and are able to withstand substantial force on their own, eventually breaking in the second and final of the double rupture peaks. Prior work further supports this unbinding mechanism, revealing that a progressive N-terminal truncation of Doc did not affect the interaction largely, unless the truncation reached the Lys-18 and Arg-19 residues (<a href=\"#bib25\">Karpol et al., 2009</a>). This corroborates the idea of the C-terminal end of helix 1 being a crucial part of the binding site within the complex. Single rupture peaks were thus observed when the wild-type complex was bound in binding mode B, and no unfolding of Ca-binding loop 1 or helix 1 occurred. Force was propagated directly to bound residues Lys-18, Leu-22, and Arg-23 which when broken resulted in complete complex dissociation."

Only traces showing a fingerprint were analyzed to ensure defined unfolding geometry. Using the rupture force distributions of singles, doubles, iLOV, and xylanase domains, we calculated the probability of occurrence of fingerprint unfolding at a force higher than the single-event ruptures. This overlap probability was found to be 0.85 for iLOV and 0.40 for xylanase. When the single/double peak ratios for were corrected for this effect, the final binding mode ratios (binding mode A/binding mode B, i.e., doubles/singles) were found to be 0.95 and 0.87 for xylanase-Doc and iLOV, respectively. These ratios are close to 1 indicating comparable probability of each binding mode after accounting for biasing the single/double peak counting statistics due to fingerprint domain stability. We note that these numbers are also slightly lower than unity due to the exclusion of double peaks that occurred before unfolding of the fingerprint domains. Further details on rupture force distributions and overlap statistics are shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. As the magnitude of biasing changes with the unfolding force distributions of each fingerprint domain, overlaps in the probability distributions allow for normalizing single/double event ratios of experimental data sets with different fingerprinting domains. For the Coh:Doc complex unbinding event, biasing (undercounting) is more pronounced for the mechanically weaker single ruptures. This normalization procedure shows the relative difference of biasing between single and double events, as double events are less biased than single events."

Overlaps in probability distributions allow normalizing single-event counts to double events to account for different biasing caused by the different unfolding forces of the fingerprint domain. Biasing occurs, because for overlapping force distributions of fingerprint unfolding and complex ruptures, unbinding events are more likely to take place without fingerprint unfolding if the two distributions are closer together. For the Coh:Doc unbinding, this effect is more pronounced for the weaker single ruptures. Because double events are also biased, this still does not give a true quantification, but only compensates for the differences of biasing. The non-bell-evans-like shape of the single rupture peaks, especially in the region of the 1st double event peak (<b>A</b>) suggests that this class of curves does not contain a single type of unbinding mechanism, but rather a superposition of different event types."

Their high affinity and specificity, along with their modularity, thermostability, and their ultrastable mechanical properties all make Coh-Doc unique from a biophysics perspective, and attractive from an engineering standpoint. Dual binding mode Doc domains are broadly predicted among many cellulosome producing bacteria (e.g. <i>C. thermocellum, C. cellulolyticum, R. flavefaciens</i>), however relatively few have been confirmed experimentally (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carvalho et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pinheiro et al., 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib4\">Br\u00e1s et al., 2012</a>).

They would be able to combine resources with neighboring cells in a mixed microbial consortium. The dual binding mode could therefore allow genetic drift to explore interspecies protein binding. Indeed, cross-species reactivity between Coh and Doc has been reported (<a href=\"#bib18\">Haimovitz et al., 2008</a>). Cellulosome-producing microbes may therefore be pursuing a middle ground between protein synthesis strictly for selfish vs.\u00a0communal usage.

Crystallography combined with mutagenesis has provided snapshots of the two modes, but resolving each of the modes for wild-type Doc under near native conditions has up until now not been possible. We have demonstrated the advantages of a single-molecule approach in resolving these subtle differences in molecular conformations of bound complexes. Despite having equal thermodynamic binding affinity, when mechanically dissociated by pulling from the N-terminus of Doc, binding mode A was more mechanically stable with an additional energy barrier. This mechanical difference was exploited to probe the two binding modes independently from one another, providing direct observation of this unique mechanism in molecular recognition. In the future, harnessing control over binding modes could offer new approaches to designing molecular assembly systems that achieve defined protein orientations."

Retraction velocities for constant speed force spectroscopy measurements varied between 0.2 and 3.2 \u00b5m/s. Cantilever spring constants were calibrated utilizing the thermal method applying the equipartition theorem to the one dimensionally oscillating lever (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hutter and Bechhoefer, 1993</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib11\">Cook et al., 2006</a>). Measurements were performed on custom built instruments, deploying an Asylum Research (Santa Barbara, CA, USA) MFP-3D AFM controller and Physik Instrumente (Karlsruhe, Germany) or attocube (Munich, Germany) piezo nanopositioners (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gumpp et al., 2009</a>). After each measurement, the xy-stage was actuated by 100 nm to probe a new spot on the surface and measure new individual Xyn-Doc fusion molecules. Instrument control software was programmed in Igor Pro 6.3 (Wavemetrics). The retraction speed was controlled with a closed-loop feedback system running internally on the AFM controller field-programmable gate array (FPGA)."

The resulting force distance traces were coarsely screened for peaks as sudden drops in force and curves with less than three peaks (such as in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panel F) were excluded, as they contain no clearly identifiable signal. Force-distance traces were transformed into contour length space with the inverse worm-like-chain model (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jobst et al., 2013</a>), assuming a fixed persistence length of 0.4 nm. Screening for the 89 nm xylanase, the 36nm iLOV and the final 8 nm final double rupture increment was performed by finding their corresponding local maxima in a kernel density estimate with bandwidth b = 1 nm. Thresholds in force, distance, and peak counts were applied to sort out nonspecific and multiple interactions. All curves were ultimately selected for the xylanase or iLOV fingerprint and checked manually. For the counting statistics, double peaks were detected as an increment of 8 +- 4 nm in contour length for final rupture peaks in the contour length plot, given that the curve showed one of the fingerprints. If a double peak was detected, the force difference was determined as the percentual difference between the first and the final rupture peak force."

The high-affinity type-I cohesin-dockerin interaction mediates the assembly of enzymatic subunits onto the central scaffoldin subunit. X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed that type-I dockerin modules, through its internal sequential symmetry, can display two modes of binding on the surface of the type-I cohesin module. These studies have been complemented with biophysical studies (e.g. isothermal titration calorimetry) and have involved the use of dockerin mutants to distinguish the two binding modes. Direct observation of this dual binding mode in solution has remained elusive, including assessing any preference for a particular mode/orientation."

The authors excluded the possibilities that these characteristic force peaks were from unfolding of CBM, xylanase, and partial unfolding of cohesion by various strictly designed control experiments. By additional studies using (GS)8-insert located between helix 1 and 2, the authors were finally able to determine that the double-peak of unfolding force separated by 8-nm is from unfolding involving loop 1 and helix 1 at the N-terminus of dockerin."

The binding residues (S11-T12) are highly conserved among Doc domains, and form hydrogen bonds to Coh. In our prior work (Stahl et al., PNAS, 2012), we mutated the Coh residue involved in hydrogen bonding to this site (Coh D39A mutant), and saw huge decrease in rupture forces. We also speculate that an intramolecular clasp, which involves hydrophobic stacking between the N- and C-termini of Doc contributes to the 1<sup>st</sup> barrier. We are currently working with collaborators on steered molecular dynamics simulations to determine which of these effects is dominant."

We looked further into this and found that even though the simple double vs. single classification seemed to indicate no differences between wild-type and Q3, when we quantified the rupture force differences between double peak events, a significant difference became apparent. We quantified the relative difference in rupture force between the two peaks in the double events (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We saw that for Q3-mutant doubles, the second peak is lower in force than the first (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, bottom) while the wild-type showed behavior where the second peak was higher (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Our interpretation is that since the second barrier is weaker than the first for the Q3 mutant, sometimes the first is missed completely (i.e., the molecule jumps over both barriers at once). Generally, each binding mode still allows for the occurrence of a single event, in which the whole Doc domain unbinds without additional unfolding, regardless of the mode the complex is currently in."

Generally, each binding mode still allows for the occurrence of a single event, in which the whole Doc domain unbinds without additional unfolding. Since the second barrier is weaker than the first for the Q3 mutant, the probability for the molecule to pass both barriers simultaneously is increased, thus resulting in a high percentage of single events.\u201d"
