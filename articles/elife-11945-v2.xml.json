Describing dynamic neural processes has proven challenging due to the problem of indexing the internal state of PFC and its trial-by-trial variation. Using primate neurophysiology and human magnetoencephalography, we here recover a single-trial index of PFC internal states from multiple simultaneously recorded PFC subregions. This index can explain the origins of neural representations of economic variables in PFC. It describes the relationship between neural dynamics and behaviour in both human and monkey PFC, directly bridging between human neuroimaging data and underlying neuronal activity. Moreover, it reveals a functionally dissociable interaction between orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral PFC in guiding cost-benefit decisions. We cast our observations in terms of a recurrent neural network model of choice, providing formal links to mechanistic dynamical accounts of decision-making."

Describing dynamic neural processes has proven challenging due to the problem of indexing the internal state of PFC and its trial-by-trial variation. Using primate neurophysiology and human magnetoencephalography, we here recover a single-trial index of PFC internal states from multiple simultaneously recorded PFC subregions. This index can explain the origins of neural representations of economic variables in PFC. It describes the relationship between neural dynamics and behaviour in both human and monkey PFC, directly bridging between human neuroimaging data and underlying neuronal activity. Moreover, it reveals a functionally dissociable interaction between orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral PFC in guiding cost-benefit decisions. We cast our observations in terms of a recurrent neural network model of choice, providing formal links to mechanistic dynamical accounts of decision-making."

While constructing a new railway line, a mistimed explosion propelled an iron bar into the base of his skull, where it passed behind his left eye before exiting through the top of his head. Gage survived the accident, but those who knew him reported significant changes in his personality and behaviour."

Decision-making involves weighing up the costs and benefits associated with alternative courses of action.

This process is dependent on a region of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, the area that sustained the most damage in Phineas Gage."

They have been richly described using static, economic models of choice (<a href=\"#bib23\">Glimcher and Fehr, 2014</a>). Neuroeconomic accounts explain firing rates of single neurons or human neuroimaging data in terms of experimental variables that motivate choice behaviour. These include the magnitude or likelihood of available reward, and the costs involved in obtaining those rewards. By forming neural representations of such quantities, it is argued that the brain can use these representations to guide selection of the most valuable alternative. Our present understanding of economic decision formation has been founded upon careful study of neural representations of value and how they differ across PFC subregions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Glimcher and Fehr, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Rushworth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rangel and Hare, 2010</a>)."

Such models seek to explain decisions in terms of their temporal evolution or <i>dynamics</i>. Whilst originally accounting for temporally varying features of behaviour, such as reaction times and eye gaze (<a href=\"#bib7\">Busemeyer and Townsend, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Krajbich et al., 2010</a>), they have also successfully captured temporally varying features of neural activity, most notably in the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) during perceptual choice (<a href=\"#bib64\">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>). These psychological models can also be related to other dynamical models (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bogacz et al., 2006</a>) such as nonlinear attractor network models firmly rooted in neurobiology (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang, 2002</a>). The common feature of both psychological and neurobiological accounts is that they focus on the temporal evolution of a decision signal <i>across</i> time, rather than the strength with which it represents decision variables at a particular fixed point <i>in</i> time."

Put simply, as the decision unfolds, neural activity will be higher on trials that ramp quickly than on those that ramp slowly. It will therefore correlate with any variable that affects the decision speed, and this effect will appear most prominent at timepoints in the trial when the ramping process, or rate of change, is maximal. Even in more complex dynamical situations, it is easy to see how economic variables that predict the rate of change would appear to be represented in neural activity if analysed without knowledge of the underlying dynamics. This might particularly be true of the value of the chosen item (\u2018chosen value\u2019), which strongly affects behavioural reaction times in economic choice tasks."

The neuroeconomic perspective often labels chosen value representations as a \u2018post-decision\u2019 signal, arguing that chosen value signals do not reflect the decision competition itself but instead the outcome of the comparison process (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Blanchard and Hayden, 2014</a>). One interpretation of such representations is that they are needed for subsequent computation of a reward prediction error (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rangel and Hare, 2010</a>). Yet the dynamical perspective proposes that they may in fact originate as a consequence of time evolving decision processes. Rather than casting a chosen value representation as signaling \u2018pre-decision\u2019 or \u2018post-decision\u2019 variables to downstream brain areas, it argues that such correlates inevitably emerge <i>as</i> a decision is made. In its most extreme form, this hypothesis might contend that chosen value signals would be fully accounted for by variation in underlying decision rates."

                        "text": "To assess this proposal more carefully, it becomes critical to index how neural dynamics unfold on individual trials. In PFC, tackling this problem provides unique challenges. Several recent studies have recovered single-trial dynamical information in structures close to motor output, based upon neuronal spiking data (<a href=\"#bib68\">Thura and Cisek, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kaufman et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Murakami et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bollimunta et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kiani et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Carnevale et al., 2015</a>). Yet the distance of PFC from either sensory input or motor output produces neural activity that is poorly aligned with simple features of the experimental task (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rigotti et al., 2013</a>). Attempts to understand PFC activity should therefore extract its dynamical state based on neural information alone, rather than first sorting spike trains by motor output or experimental variables as is common in other approaches. It is also unclear whether neuronal firing rates are in fact the most reliable source of single-trial information. The esotericism of PFC neuronal responses is compounded by a high degree of stochasticity in neuronal spike trains, delivering statistical challenges to obtaining single-trial information (<a href=\"#bib15\">Churchland et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Park et al., 2014</a>). Current techniques sometimes overcome this problem by examining tens or hundreds of simultaneously recorded single neurons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Churchland et al., 2007</a>). Whilst this can be fruitful, such data is rarely available in humans, where the contribution of PFC to value-guided choice is most critical."

We focussed on observations at the mesoscopic scale of the local field potential (LFP). One advantage of this approach is that it can be easily related to simultaneously recorded neuronal spike trains on a trial-by-trial basis in animals, but also underlies the magnetoencephalography (MEG) signal observable in humans (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buzs\u00e1ki et al., 2012</a>). As such, we could recover dynamical information from electrophysiology recordings in macaque monkeys and also from non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings in humans. This provides an important bridge between observations at microscopic (cellular) and macroscopic (whole-brain) scales. Importantly, our index provides information about the speed of a <i>local</i> internal neural decision process that goes beyond a simple behavioural measure of reaction time."

We first demonstrate a temporal evolution from action value difference to chosen action signals that are selectively present in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) neurons, but not anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) or orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). This contrasts against the ubiquitous encoding across all three subregions of \u2018chosen value\u2019. However, we then demonstrate that correlates of chosen value may arise as a consequence of dynamical processing, as opposed to being purely represented as a neuroeconomic post-decision variable. Next, by simultaneously indexing decision formation across multiple PFC subregions, we show that functional interactions can be reshaped in a task-dependent manner. We find that OFC and ACC dynamics selectively influence dorsolateral DLPFC activity on delay- and effort-based decisions respectively. Finally, our observations can be related to predictions from a dynamical neural network model of choice. This provides formal links to established dynamical mechanisms underlying perceptual decision-making."

On each trial, subjects chose between two pictures that led to a certain reward magnitude (quantity of fruit juice) after paying a certain cost (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). On half of trials this cost was physical effort needed to obtain reward, and on half of trials it was delay to reward. Subjects were overtrained on the cost and benefit paired with each picture. Their choices were well described by a linear trade-off between reward and cost combined with a softmax choice function (see <a href=\"#bib27\">Hosokawa et al., 2013</a> for detailed behavioural modelling). This allows a straightforward definition of \u2018value\u2019 used in the analyses below (see methods). Throughout the paper, we analyse neuronal firing and LFP during a 1s choice phase, when\u00a0subjects fixated centrally whilst both pictures were on screen.

Using multiple regression on single neuron firing rates, we observed a dynamic (time-varying) signature of value correlates in the DLPFC (n=303 neurons) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Early in the trial, value correlates were found in the reference frame of <i>action value difference</i> (i.e. left minus right saccade value influenced neural firing; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, blue), but late in the trial these evolved into correlates of the eventual <i>chosen saccade</i> (left vs. right chosen saccade influenced neural firing; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, red) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Louie and Glimcher, 2010</a>). DLPFC neurons that showed strong selectivity for left minus right saccade option value 300\u00a0ms after decision onset also showed strong selectivity for left minus right choices 700\u00a0ms after decision onset (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This temporal evolution from action value difference to categorical choice was selectively present in DLPFC, but not ACC (n\u00a0=\u00a0321 neurons) or OFC (n\u00a0=\u00a0212 neurons) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The overall shape of the choice phase evoked LFP was surprisingly consistent across PFC subregions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and subjects (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). All areas contained a fast biphasic component shortly after sensory input, and a slower component lasting several hundred milliseconds after this. Because of this similarity, we collapsed across regions (see <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a> for regions separately), and regressed LFP amplitude onto both <i>chosen value</i> and <i>unchosen value</i> across time. This revealed two timepoints at which correlates of value emerged (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Early in the trial (~250\u00a0ms) value correlates were positive for both chosen and unchosen value, but later in the trial (~450\u00a0ms) value correlates for unchosen value flipped to become negatively signed. This implies a temporal evolution from an early representation of value sum (=chosen+unchosen value) to a later representation of value difference (=chosen-unchosen value). This progression is notably similar to observations made in human PFC during value-guided choice using MEG (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hunt et al., 2012</a>). Crucially, these value correlates were maximal when the event-related LFP was <i>ramping</i>, not <i>peaking</i> (that is, when the temporal derivative of the LFP was large [<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>]). This suggests chosen and unchosen value influence the rate at which LFP dynamics unfold on each trial, rather than being explicitly represented by the amplitude of an evoked response."

Yet it remains unclear how we might bridge these dynamics at different scales. Below, we demonstrate that forming such bridges is of fundamental importance, especially if it can be achieved at the level of individual trials. It allows us to interrogate the relationship between neural dynamics and behaviour, the encoding of neuroeconomic variables, and how brain regions interact during choice. Moreover, by applying to the same approach to human data, it links observations in human MEG recordings with their underlying neuronal counterparts."

Importantly, they were readily interpretable in terms of their effects on LFP dynamics. PC1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, left panel) resembled the basic shape of the event-related field potential (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Adding or subtracting PC1 therefore captures variation across trials in response <i>amplitude</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, left panel). More notable, however, was PC2, which was relatively flat at the beginning of the decision, but from 200\u00a0ms onwards resembled the <i>temporal derivative</i> of PC1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, right panel). Adding or subtracting the temporal derivative of a waveform controls the <i>latency</i> at which it peaks (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, right panel) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Friston et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mayhew et al., 2006</a>). Knowledge about PC2 weights therefore provides a parsimonious description of single-trial ERP latencies, a key feature of the dynamical ERP response. Consistent with this idea, PC2 weights were also found to correlate with the phase of low frequency (theta frequency [4-\u20138\u00a0Hz]) oscillations during the decision period (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

We found <i>chosen value</i> had a strong and consistent effect on PC2 across all regions studied. When chosen value was higher, PC2 was more positive, implying the waveform peaked earlier in time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). On \u2018error trials\u2019, where the subject chose the less valuable option, PC2 weights were more positive than on correct (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Under the assumption that higher value trials, and error trials, were associated with faster decision dynamics (<a href=\"#bib7\">Busemeyer and Townsend, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</a>), PC2 weights therefore provide a neurally-derived index of the speed of the decision on each trial. Crucially, however, they are obtained separately for each individual electrode. They therefore provide a <i>local</i> measurement of neural dynamics, beyond a simple behavioural measure of reaction time. PC1 weights, capturing response amplitude rather than latency, were primarily influenced by value sum (same sign for both chosen and unchosen value, with the exception of ACC) (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

However, we also included as a coregressor the single-trial PC2 weight for that trial, estimated from the decomposition of the LFP. This allows us to examine the influence of PC2 weights on neuronal firing, having controlled for the contribution of all external decision variables. To avoid contamination between spikes and LFP, we used LFP data recorded simultaneously from a neighbouring electrode in the same cortical area.

In both cases, the LFP-derived PC2 single trials weights explain additional variance as this value-to-choice transformation occurs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A/B</a>). Across the population, PC2 had a similar effect at this point in time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). 44.9% of neurons in DLPFC were found to have a significant modulation by LFP-derived PC2 weights during the choice epoch (23.4% positively modulated, 21.5% negatively modulated, p&lt;0.01 in a 250\u00a0ms\u2013750\u00a0ms window, corrected for multiple comparisons across time). This finding forms a link between choice dynamics at mesoscopic and microscopic scales, over and above that which can be obtained from examining time-varying value correlates (as in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Additional analyses confirmed that this relationship could not be explained as a simple consequence of first-order correlations between LFP amplitude and firing rate (<a href=\"#bib70\">Whittingstall and Logothetis, 2009</a>)."

Because our LFP decomposition indexes decision dynamics locally, we hypothesised that the internal dynamics of ACC and OFC might preferentially influence activity in DLPFC on different trial types. Specifically, we predicted that firing rates in DLPFC would be preferentially affected by ACC internal dynamics on effort-based trials, but by OFC internal dynamics on delay-based trials. We could test this hypothesis by examining sessions in which DLPFC, ACC and OFC were all recorded simultaneously. We built a regression model in which LFP-derived PC2 weights from OFC and ACC competed for variance in explaining neural firing in DLPFC (see Methods). We estimated this separately on delay and effort trials. Both areas were found to influence DLPFC activity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), but strikingly, ACC explained more variance in DLPFC firing on effort trials than delay trials (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, magenta), whereas the converse was true for OFC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, black).

We analysed the model predictions as we had the data, regressing action value difference, chosen value and chosen action onto single-neuron firing rates. Strikingly, value correlates in the network model possessed the same temporal profile as in DLPFC neurons (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> with <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). One discrepancy was the more sustained chosen value signal in the network model than in the data (which may result from inputs to the model persisting even after an attractor basin has been reached). We then ran a similar dimensionality reduction on summed network activity, a proxy for the model\u2019s LFP predictions, as we had done on both macaque LFP and human MEG data. By contrast with the LFP data, we obtained a single principal component that controlled both waveform amplitude and latency (see \u2018Supplementary details of network modelling\u2019, and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that within the network model there is covariation between these two features of the simulated ERP waveform, whereas in the data they are orthogonal. However, this principal component correlated with value in a similar fashion to both macaque and human data (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E/6C</a> with <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). We then regressed the principal component back onto single unit firing rates, as in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. We found a similar timecourse of influence of the model\u2019s principal component on single unit firing to that found in the data (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> with <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, cyan). Moreover, we found that the internal dynamics of the model extracted from the PCA explained chosen value coding in a similar fashion to that observed in data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), causing a marked reduction (compare <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a> with <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, green). Our observations in this study may therefore be explained mechanistically via a simple attractor network model of choice, which similarly captured LFP dynamics in our previous human MEG study (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hunt et al., 2012</a>).

Why this quantity is encoded so widely has been a matter of debate (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rangel and Hare, 2010</a>). It is important to remember that this encoding comes from the viewpoint of the experimenter, seeking to describe variability across trials at a particular timepoint in the trial or decision process. As we have shown here, and would be predicted from previous behavioural studies (<a href=\"#bib7\">Busemeyer and Townsend, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Krajbich et al., 2010</a>), decision processes are dynamic and decision formation inherently exhibits variability across trials. This means that what appears to the experimenter as encoding of a decision related-signal may be a consequence of another ongoing process. To paraphrase a recent observation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cisek, 2006</a>), \u201cthe role of a decision-making system is to produce decisions, not to describe them.\u201d"

This has been most carefully considered in integrate-to-bound models of perceptual choice and their neural correlates (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>). Crucially, the time at which sensory evidence is maximally encoded in a neural integrator is not at the beginning of the decision (when no integration has occurred), nor at the end (when the bound has been reached on all trials), but in the <i>middle</i> of the decision process \u2013 when on some trials the bound has been reached, whereas on others little net evidence has been accumulated for each alternative. It can be very difficult in practice to infer when a decision begins or ends, and this poses difficulties when labelling a neural correlate as \u2018pre-decision\u2019 or \u2018post-decision\u2019. The dynamical perspective instead explains certain correlates as emerging <i>as</i> the decision is formed. These signals may still remain of functional significance for other computations (such as subsequent computation of the reward prediction error [<a href=\"#bib57\">Rangel and Hare, 2010</a>]), but our perspective on how they are generated is changed."

This brings into focus the potentially important role played by decision dynamics in generating correlates of chosen value. In the present study, we found that in DLPFC correlates of chosen value occurred maximally during the transformation from an initial representation of evidence (action value difference) to an eventual representation of choice (chosen action) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). A similar temporal progression could also be found in the network model of competition via mutual inhibition (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Crucially, however, a portion of the variance captured by chosen value was then explained away by including the speed and amplitude of the local LFP response on that trial as a coregressor, estimated via PCA decomposition of the LFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Firstly, only some, not all, of the variance was removed by including PCA components as coregressors. As such, it may be the case that there is coding of chosen value during the decision that is not explained by the amplitude and speed of the evoked response during decision formation. However, despite the reasonable signal-to-noise ratio observed in LFP data, single-trial PC weights will likely contain a degree of observation noise. Hence our estimates likely form a lower bound on how much of the chosen value signal might be explained away by LFP dynamics. To address this question further, future studies might seek to estimate the degree of observation noise in estimating dynamics, and the theoretical limit that this imposes on how much variance could be explained in neural firing. A further important caveat is that chosen value correlates may be explained by different mechanisms at different points in the trial. LFPs are often interpreted as measurements of local synaptic input, and this may imply that our principal components mediate chosen value representations at the level of single units. It is also clear from <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> that correlates of chosen value are present in single unit firing until the end of the decision epoch. Future work may investigate the origin and functional significance of this persistent chosen value coding, perhaps for use at later task stages."

This was evidenced most clearly by examining the interaction between OFC and ACC principal component weights, and DLPFC neuronal firing. Previous work has suggested a functional specialisation of OFC and ACC for delay- and effort-based decisions, respectively. In rats, lesions made to OFC lead to impulsive choices (of a small, immediate reward over a larger, delayed reward) whereas lesions made to ACC lead to less effortful choices (of a small, easily obtained reward over a larger reward demanding more work) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rudebeck et al., 2006</a>). In humans, functional imaging activations yield a similar double dissociation between effortful and delay-based decisions (<a href=\"#bib56\">Prevost et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Croxson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kurniawan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kable and Glimcher, 2007</a>), and further evidence can be drawn from the effects of electrical stimulation of ACC (<a href=\"#bib55\">Parvizi et al., 2013</a>). Our results extend these findings by suggesting that the rate at which dynamics unfold in OFC preferentially influences a decision signal in DLPFC on delay-based trials relative to effort-based trials, whereas the converse is true for ACC\u2019s influence on DLPFC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This supports the view that the effective influence of one brain region on another is modulated by the type of decision currently being made (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hunt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tauste Campo et al., 2015</a>).

However, at the mesoscopic scale, dynamics of chosen value correlates were relatively indistinguishable across regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). One explanation for these phenomena is that competition proceeds in a distributed fashion across multiple areas (<a href=\"#bib62\">Rushworth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hunt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cisek, 2012</a>). Competition in DLPFC might occur selectively in saccadic action space, but this might be complemented by parallel competitions in other regions in other reference frames. Examples of such competitions might include those over particular decision attributes (e.g. OFC for delay, ACC for effort/physical action value), abstract goods (<a href=\"#bib53\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</a>), internal state variables (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bouret and Richmond, 2010</a>), attentional allocation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lim et al., 2011</a>), goal or task-relevant prioritisation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hunt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hare et al., 2009</a>) or other reference frames critical for the decision at hand (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hunt et al., 2013</a>). Though lesion evidence clearly implicates areas like ACC, OFC and ventromedial PFC as critical and dissociable in value-based decision-making (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kennerley et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rudebeck et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Camille et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Noonan et al., 2010</a>), our results indicate that identifying \u2018chosen value\u2019 signals is not sufficient to understand the functional dissociations of these areas in the decision-making process. Further studies are needed to fully understand the reference frame in which different decision areas contribute to decision-making (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hunt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Boorman et al., 2013</a>), with a careful consideration of the relationship between underlying choice dynamics and neuronal correlates of value. Future recurrent\u00a0network models of choice involving hierarchical competitions across multiple areas (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hunt et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chaudhuri et al., 2015</a>) might also capture this distributed approach, and seek to explain our observations concerning the selective effort- and delay-based interactions across areas (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). A distributed account would predict that in other experimental paradigms, single neurons would show similar competitive dynamics to our DLPFC neurons but in complementary frames of reference (<a href=\"#bib63\">Rustichini and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Strait et al., 2014</a>)."

Directly computing the ERP waveform and its temporal derivative would also be a valid approach to derive temporal basis functions. However, this approach may face problems if different components of the evoked response do not covary with each other. For example, the large, fast evoked response observed across all regions within 200\u00a0ms of stimulus onset (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) was comparatively small in the first two principal components (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

In brief, four male rhesus macaques served as subjects. Arrays of 10-\u201324 tungsten microelectrodes (FHC Instruments) were lowered acutely each day. Recordings were made from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; primarily the dorsal bank of the principal sulcus), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; primarily areas 11 and 13 between the medial and lateral orbital sulci) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; primarily area 24c in the dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus). Recordings were also made from two subjects in the cingulate motor area, but this region is not considered in the present study. We excluded 5 sessions in monkey B that contained exclusively effort-based or delay-based decisions, 1 further session in monkey B where LFP data was not recorded, and 2 sessions in monkey E where the LFP data was heavily artifact-contaminated. Any electrode which did not contain a well-isolated neuron, and so might not lie within grey matter, was not included in the LFP analysis. From visual inspection of the evoked data, we further excluded from further analysis ~4% of individual electrodes that contained a high degree of artifact in the LFP recording. The numbers of recording electrodes included from each subject, after all exclusion criteria were applied, are shown in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. (As multiple units could occasionally be isolated from the same electrode, the total number of neurons exceeded the total number of electrodes for each region.)

This was with the exception of monkey K, who could not be sufficiently well-trained to fixate and so was free to saccade during the 1\u00a0s period.

To overcome this, we used an iterated procedure that selected a sign for each subject that maximised the correlation coefficient in the evoked response, between subjects, and then multiplied each subject\u2019s data by the appropriate sign. Note that this sign-flipping correction does not produce changes in the PCA decomposition of the data, but instead simply ensures that the principal component weights can be interpreted in a consistent manner across subjects.

For main <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, a regression model was estimated containing 19 coregressors to model out the effect of all experimental variables (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> for a full list), plus the regressor of interest (trial-by-trial weights of PC2, derived from PCA decomposition of LFP from a simultaneously recorded electrode in another part of DLPFC). The CPD for the LFP-derived PC2 on single neuron firing was then estimated from this model. To calculate the percentage of individual significant neurons (in main text), we estimated a significance criterion that controlled for multiple comparisons across time empirically from the data, by repeating the regression model but permuting the design matrix\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib49\">Nichols and Holmes, 2002</a>). Within a time window of 250\u00a0ms-\u2013750\u00a0ms after choice onset, this yielded a p&lt;0.01 significance criterion of Z&gt;2.99 for significant positive responses, and Z&lt;-3.05 for significant negative responses. Any neurons exceeding these thresholds at any point during this time window are reported as significant. We found the CPD for PC2 remained similar when a reduced model of experimental variables was used, containing 6 coregressors rather than 19 \u2013 a constant term for each trial type, an indicator variable for the chosen action (L-R), the action value difference between left and right options, and the chosen value. For <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A/B</a>, we used this model and plotted CPD for action value difference, LFP-derived PC2 and chosen action in two single-neuron examples. For <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and associated figure supplements, we repeated this model, but subtracted the CPD for chosen value, action value difference and chosen action for a model that included PC1 and PC2 as coregressors, versus a model that included PC101 and PC102 (to account for any potential general reduction in CPD by including coregressors). Positive values on this figure therefore indicate a reduction in explained variance by experimental factors when PC1 and PC2 are included as coregressors in the model. Note that these analyses required simultaneously recorded LFP from another electrode in the same brain region, but this was only available for some recording sessions. The number of recorded neurons in each analysis was therefore smaller than in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>/<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (DLPFC: n=205 neurons; OFC: n=114; ACC: n=194).\u00a0For <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, we sought to explore whether local LFP principal components provide greater contributions to the reduction in chosen value variance than those recorded from other areas. We therefore repeated the same analysis as in main <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, but first orthogonalised local (DLPFC) PC1/2 weights with respect to PC1/2 weights from another simultaneously recorded area (either OFC/ACC). However, because both electrodes will contain observation noise on every trial, this analysis alone may not fully control for distal brain region effects. To provide a fairer comparison, we therefore performed the same analysis in reverse: examining the effect of the distal OFC/ACC PC1/2 weights, orthogonalised with respect to the local DLPFC PC1/2 weights. <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a> shows the latter analysis (distal orthogonalised with respect to\u00a0local) subtracted from the former (local orthogonalised with respect to distal)."

Option values have a strong influence on firing rates of the selective neurons early in the trial (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, blue), but later in the trial, as the network selects an option by approaching a stable attractor state, firing rates become better explained by the network\u2019s choice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, red). At the same time, the <i>chosen</i> value also influences neuronal firing (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, green).

In a previous study, we showed that this transition is predicted to occur at the level of the LFP from the network model, and also that these predictions explained observations in human MEG data (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hunt et al., 2012</a>). We therefore investigated whether we could apply a similar PCA decomposition to the model to that adopted to study our macaque LFP and human MEG data (main <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), and also whether variability in LFP dynamics would similarly explain away chosen value coding in single neuron firing rates, as observed in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>."

The shape of the evoked LFP response from the model is shown in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>. Note that the evoked response from the model differs somewhat from the data. First, at the end of the trial, the model remains in a stable (working memory) attractor state with high activity, whereas the evoked response appears to return gradually towards its baseline level. This could easily be explained by the prepared action plan not being stored in prefrontal cortex, but in premotor regions. A second difference is that there is little to no variation in the single-trial <i>amplitude</i> of the response. Instead, the <i>principal</i> source of variability is in the reaction time, or rate of rise, of the network model. The only variation in amplitude is when the model reaches its final attractor state, but crucially this covaries with the speed at which the attractor basin is approached, and so with the rate of rise of the model. As such, the top two principal components (shown in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) do not straightforwardly resemble the principal components in the data: it is <i>PC1</i> that captures the primary variation in response latency, playing a similar role to PC2 in the data (see <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We therefore regressed single-trial model PC1 weights onto chosen and unchosen value, errors and reaction times, and found a similar pattern of results to that found in the data \u2013 a predominant influence of chosen value on single trial PC1 weights; a smaller, but positive influence of unchosen value on single trial PC1 weights, not found in the current dataset; a positive influence of error trials on network PC1 weights, and a strong negative influence of reaction times on network PC1 weights (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

The main issues that came up in the review discussion (some of which are reiterated by the individual reviewer comments below) are as follows. First, both reviewers thought that the conclusions were overstated. They felt that while the PCA analysis was interesting, just because some of the variance in chosen value signals could be accounted for by a latency-based PC, that does not itself make the chosen value signal functionally irrelevant (epiphenomenal) (and even then, some variance remained). They also weren't compelled by the implication that the signals are pre-decisional rather than post-decisional, given that it is very difficult to infer when a decision was made (i.e. to show that the signal emerges when LFP is still ramping does not necessarily imply that it was prior to the decision). It was felt that it is equally plausible and perhaps more likely that CV signals are emerging <i>as</i> decisions are formed, and that CV signals have multiple functions, depending on the time point."

And its relationship to task variables (chosen value and error commission) provides some validation. But the reviewers were equally concerned about the relationship with effort vs delay signals given the timing of the observed variables, and the significance of the LFP latency metric's relationship to spiking activity seems murkier."

The most important piece of data was the single-neuron activity recorded from 3 different cortical areas, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The authors have also analyzed the local field potential (LFP) data collected from these areas in the same experiment. The results obtained from these analyses were then compared to the results from the human MEG experiment and their network model, which is based on an influential model of Wang (2002). Through a set of clever analyses, the authors draw their main conclusion that a trial-by-trial index of decision dynamics, derived from the PCA analysis of LFP data, was largely correlated with the chosen value. Most interestingly, this index was used to demonstrate that the functional interactions between different cortical areas reflect the type of information considered during decision making (e.g., delay vs. effort). However, there are several major weaknesses in this manuscript."

This argument is not convincing. It appears that the same logic, if applied to other types of signals encoded by any neurons, would make virtually any kind of neural signals epiphenomenon. In other words, the fact that a certain type of signal encoded by a given neuron can be accounted for by the local dynamics of its surrounding network does not mean that the encoded signal has no functional significance."

But the idea that neural signals evolve dynamically isn't incompatible with the idea that they represent economic variables. This paper's conclusions really seem to pertain to how, rather than whether, economic variables are neurally represented. The results suggest that chosen value, for example, is encoded in the LFP amplitude in a specific time window (e.g. around 400 ms where PC2 peaks, indicative of the latency of the underlying waveform), rather than, say, the overall peak of the evoked LFP."

The analysis provided by the authors (effect of local LFP after orthogonalizing on LFP from another region) is encouraging in this regard, however supporting the claim would also require showing that the opposite is not true (i.e. that running the analysis in reverse does not yield the same result). The correlation coefficients in the histograms of <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a> suggest that this may be the case, although there does not seem to be much of a within region advantage for DLPFC in particular. Also, as far as I can tell, the authors did not incorporate reaction time, which is typically used as a trial-by-trial indicator of decision dynamics, into these analyses. I suspect that this is because the required delay is sufficiently long to create a floor effect on RTs, however if this is the case it deserves mention in the text. Otherwise the authors should test whether LFP measures relate to the \"chosen value\" aspects of neural activity after accounting for RT."

Yet I found the interpretation of this point to be somewhat overly specific: \"We therefore questioned whether chosen value coding might simply be a consequence of the same neural dynamics occurring at varying latencies across trials.\" This is certainly one interpretation of the authors' results, but not the only one. Another (more standard) interpretation of this finding is that the LFP components mediate the chosen value representations at the level of single units. Given that the LFPs are often interpreted as measurements of local synaptic input, I find this interpretation to be fairly reasonable and consistent with the data provided. The finding that PC1 (which does not contain timing information) also steals variance from chosen value may even provide some specific evidence for this interpretation. As I understand it, the main reason that the authors' interpret the data in terms of dynamics is provided in the final analysis showing that in an attractor network of decision-making the same sorts of signals emerge as a byproduct of competition. I think in order to improve the clarity it would be useful to avoid specific interpretations of causality until the Discussion section where both possibilities should be discussed."

The authors foreground an analysis showing that the chosen-value effect in spike rates is reduced by jointly including PC1 (indexing LFP amplitude) and PC2 (indexing LFP latency) in the regression model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). I still don't see how this is germane to their conclusion about latency. The specific effect of the latency-related PC2 is now shown as a supplement, and is considerably weaker albeit nonzero. The original chosen-value effect, which peaked at a% CPD of around 0.9 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), is reduced by up to about 0.1 by both PCs together (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), or 0.03 by PC2 alone (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). So wouldn't it be at least as accurate to conclude that chosen-value effects emerge from the same neural dynamics occurring at different amplitudes across trials? (The predictions of the attractor network are also unclear in this regard, i.e. in the predictions for combination of PCs, and so it seems important that the authors clarify the predictions of the attractor model.) The same concern applies to the local-versus-distal result in <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, which is interpreted solely in terms of neural latency but results for PC2 alone are not shown."

This may not be so starkly different from existing perspectives, although it's of course still valuable to see the details of how it plays out. The authors could also easily reframe the result that LFP measures partially mediate the chosen value effect and tone down the oppositional framing of decision dynamics versus static chosen value representation. They could use the network model results as a podium to say that chosen value representations need not emerge for the purpose of encoding chosen value, which would be entirely accurate from my standpoint."

In my opinion, such a finding would not necessarily detract from the dynamics idea, as overall ACC signal amplitude may play a role in adjusting decision threshold, which directly affects dynamics.

They felt that while the PCA analysis was interesting, just because some of the variance in chosen value signals could be accounted for by a latency-based PC, that does not itself make the chosen value signal functionally irrelevant (epiphenomenal) (and even then, some variance remained). They also weren't compelled by the implication that the signals are pre-decisional rather than post-decisional, given that it is very difficult to infer when a decision was made (i.e. to show that the signal emerges when LFP is still ramping does not necessarily imply that it was prior to the decision).

The authors have also analyzed the local field potential (LFP) data collected from these areas in the same experiment. The results obtained from these analyses were then compared to the results from the human MEG experiment and their network model, which is based on an influential model of Wang (2002). Through a set of clever analyses, the authors draw their main conclusion that a trial-by-trial index of decision dynamics, derived from the PCA analysis of LFP data, was largely correlated with the chosen value. Most interestingly, this index was used to demonstrate that the functional interactions between different cortical areas reflect the type of information considered during decision making (e.g., delay vs. effort).</i>"

We are unaware of any study that has used this model to explain the dynamics of single unit data in DLPFC, shown that the action value to chosen action transformation occurs within the same neurons, shown that chosen value single neuron correlates are found with similar strengths and time-courses across multiple simultaneously recorded brain regions, and shown that the LFP value signals emerge as the signal is ramping (when the derivative of the signal is high).

Crucially, the measure provides a local measure of decision formation that otherwise we would not have access to, and it does so on a single-trial basis. It is only because the PCA provides access to these single-trial estimates that we are able to deduce that the chosen value signal is related to internal decision speeds.

The authors foreground an analysis showing that the chosen-value effect in spike rates is reduced by jointly including PC1 (indexing LFP amplitude) and PC2 (indexing LFP latency) in the regression model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). I still don't see how this is germane to their conclusion about latency. The specific effect of the latency-related PC2 is now shown as a supplement, and is considerably weaker albeit nonzero. The original chosen-value effect, which peaked at a% CPD of around 0.9 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), is reduced by up to about 0.1 by both PCs together (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), or 0.03 by PC2 alone (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). So wouldn't it be at least as accurate to conclude that chosen-value effects emerge from the same neural dynamics occurring at different amplitudes across trials? (The predictions of the attractor network are also unclear in this regard, i.e. in the predictions for combination of PCs, and so it seems important that the authors clarify the predictions of the attractor model.) The same concern applies to the local-versus-distal result in <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, which is interpreted solely in terms of neural latency but results for PC2 alone are not shown. It seems to me an easier conclusion to square with the data would be that chosen-value effects originate from a combination of the amplitude and speed of the dynamically unfolding neural response. This may not be so starkly different from existing perspectives, although it's of course still valuable to see the details of how it plays out. The authors could also easily reframe the result that LFP measures partially mediate the chosen value effect and tone down the oppositional framing of decision dynamics versus static chosen value representation. They could use the network model results as a podium to say that chosen value representations need not emerge for the purpose of encoding chosen value, which would be entirely accurate from my standpoint.</i>"
