                    "text": "Metabolic homeostasis requires coordination between circadian clocks in different tissues. Also, systemic signals appear to be required for some transcriptional rhythms in the mammalian liver and the <i>Drosophila</i> fat body. Here we show that free-running oscillations of the fat body clock require clock function in the PDF-positive cells of the fly brain. Interestingly, rhythmic expression of the cytochrome P450 transcripts, <i>sex-specific enzyme 1 (sxe1</i>) and <i>Cyp6a21</i>, which cycle in the fat body independently of the local clock, depends upon clocks in neurons expressing neuropeptide F (NPF). NPF signaling itself is required to drive cycling of <i>sxe1</i> and <i>Cyp6a21</i> in the fat body, and its mammalian ortholog, Npy, functions similarly to regulate cycling of cytochrome P450 genes in the mouse liver. These data highlight the importance of neuronal clocks for peripheral rhythms, particularly in a specific detoxification pathway, and identify a novel and conserved role for NPF/Npy in circadian rhythms."

Also, systemic signals appear to be required for some transcriptional rhythms in the mammalian liver and the <i>Drosophila</i> fat body. Here we show that free-running oscillations of the fat body clock require clock function in the PDF-positive cells of the fly brain. Interestingly, rhythmic expression of the cytochrome P450 transcripts, <i>sex-specific enzyme 1 (sxe1</i>) and <i>Cyp6a21</i>, which cycle in the fat body independently of the local clock, depends upon clocks in neurons expressing neuropeptide F (NPF). NPF signaling itself is required to drive cycling of <i>sxe1</i> and <i>Cyp6a21</i> in the fat body, and its mammalian ortholog, Npy, functions similarly to regulate cycling of cytochrome P450 genes in the mouse liver. These data highlight the importance of neuronal clocks for peripheral rhythms, particularly in a specific detoxification pathway, and identify a novel and conserved role for NPF/Npy in circadian rhythms."

The lateral neurons include the small and large ventral lateral neurons (LNvs), the dorsal lateral neurons (LN<sub>d</sub>s) and the lateral posterior neurons (LPNs). The dorsal neurons are divided into three subgroups, dorsal neurons (DN) 1, 2, and 3. The small LNvs (sLNvs) have traditionally been referred to as the central clock because they are necessary and sufficient for rest:activity rhythms under constant conditions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Grima et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Stoleru et al., 2004</a>), but recent studies also indicate an important role for the LN<sub>d</sub>s (<a href=\"#bib24\">Guo et al., 2014</a>). The LNvs express the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF), which is important for rest:activity rhythms (<a href=\"#bib61\">Renn et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Stoleru et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Yoshii et al., 2009</a>) and for the function of circadian clocks in some peripheral tissues (<a href=\"#bib55\">Myers et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Krupp et al., 2013</a>).

For instance, a peripheral clock located in the fat body, a tissue analogous to mammalian liver and adipose tissue (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arrese and Soulages, 2010</a>), regulates feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib80\">Xu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Seay and Thummel, 2011</a>) and nutrient storage (<a href=\"#bib80\">Xu et al., 2008</a>) and drives the rhythmic expression of genes involved in metabolism, detoxification, innate immunity, and reproduction (<a href=\"#bib79\">Xu et al., 2011</a>). Molecular clocks in the brain and fat body have different effects on metabolism, suggesting that clocks in these two tissues complement each other to maintain metabolic homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib80\">Xu et al., 2008</a>). Such homeostasis requires interaction between organismal clocks, but how this occurs, for example whether neuronal clocks regulate fat body clocks, as they do for some other tissue-specific clocks, is not known. In addition, the fat body clock does not regulate all circadian fat body transcripts. 40% of rhythmically expressed fat body transcripts are unperturbed by the absence of a functional fat body clock (<a href=\"#bib79\">Xu et al., 2011</a>), suggesting these genes are controlled by rhythmic external factors, which could include light, food, and/or signals from clocks in other tissues (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wijnen et al., 2006</a>). Likewise in the mammalian liver, where circadian gene regulation has been well-studied, cyclic expression of many genes persists when the liver clock is ablated (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kornmann et al., 2007a</a>). Brain specific rescue of clock function in <i>Clock<sup>\u039419</sup></i> animals partially restored liver gene expression rhythms (~40%), albeit with compromised amplitude (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hughes et al., 2012</a>). The specific signals that mediate this rescue, however, were not identified, although systemic signals that regulate peripheral clocks have been identified (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cailotto et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kornmann et al., 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Reddy et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Oishi et al., 2005</a>)."

In this study, we found that neural clocks regulate circadian gene expression in the fly fat body, a peripheral metabolic tissue. We demonstrate that cycling of the core clock gene, <i>period (per</i>), requires PDF-expressing cells in constant darkness. Interestingly, however, clocks in the NPF-expressing subset of LN<sub>d</sub>s, as well as NPF itself, are important for driving rhythmic expression of specific cytochrome P450 genes that cycle independently of the fat body clock. Lastly, we show that Npy, the mouse homolog of NPF, regulates transcriptional circadian output in the mouse liver. Microarray analyses reveal that Npy contributes to the rhythmic expression of hundreds of transcripts in the liver, including a subset of cytochrome P450 genes. In summary, we identified a conserved role for NPF/Npy neuropeptides in the circadian system in coupling neuronal clocks to transcriptional output in peripheral tissues in flies and mice."

For example, PDF-positive LNvs are required for rhythmic expression of clock components in the prothoracic gland, a peripheral tissue that gates rhythmic eclosion (<a href=\"#bib55\">Myers et al., 2003</a>). In addition, PDF released by neurons in the abdominal ganglion is necessary to set the phase of the clock in oenocytes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Krupp et al., 2013</a>), which regulate sex pheromone production and mating behavior (<a href=\"#bib42\">Krupp et al., 2008</a>). We investigated whether clocks in PDF-positive LNvs were necessary for clock function in the abdominal fat body. The molecular clock in <i>Drosophila</i> consists of an autoregulatory loop in which the transcription factors, CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC), activate expression of the genes <i>period (per)</i> and <i>timeless (tim)</i> and PER and TIM proteins feedback to inhibit the activity of CLK-CYC (<a href=\"#bib86\">Zheng and Sehgal, 2012</a>). To disrupt the molecular clock exclusively in PDF-positive cells, we used the GAL4/UAS system to express a dominant-negative version of the CLK transcription factor, CLK\u0394. CLK\u0394 lacks regions of its DNA-binding domain, preventing it from binding DNA and activating transcription of genes, including components of the molecular clock. However, CLK\u0394 can still heterodimerize with its partner, CYC, through its protein interaction domain (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tanoue et al., 2004</a>). Behavioral assays of <i>Pdf</i>-GAL4/UAS-CLK\u0394 flies showed that a majority of the flies had arrhythmic locomotor activity in constant darkness (DD) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), confirming that CLK\u0394 expression in the LNvs disrupts circadian rhythms."

We found that circadian expression of <i>per</i> in the fat body was not altered in flies with a disrupted central clock (<i>Pdf</i>-GAL4/UAS-CLK\u0394) under a 12\u00a0hr light: 12\u00a0hr dark (LD) cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Unlike mammals, peripheral clocks in <i>Drosophila</i> can detect light, which acts as the dominant entrainment signal (<a href=\"#bib59\">Plautz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Oishi et al., 2004</a>). Therefore, under LD conditions, light may directly synchronize oscillations in <i>per</i> transcript levels in fat body cells, masking the effects of ablating the central clock. Consequently, we evaluated <i>per</i> rhythms in the absence of light. Since rhythmic gene expression dampens under constant conditions and is undetectable in the fat body by the sixth day of DD (<a href=\"#bib79\">Xu et al., 2011</a>), we tested rhythmic expression of <i>per</i> on the second day in DD (DD2). <i>per</i> levels were rhythmic in the fat body of control flies on DD2. In contrast, flies expressing CLK\u0394 in the LNvs showed an apparent lack of <i>per</i> rhythms in the fat body (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; see Discussion). This suggests that the clock in PDF-positive LNvs influences the peripheral fat body clock in the absence of external environmental cues."

Several potential mechanisms could explain rhythmic gene expression in the absence of the local tissue-specific clock, for example, light, nutrients, or clocks located in other tissues. As noted above, many tissues in <i>Drosophila</i> have photoreceptors. Therefore, in addition to entraining clocks to the external environment, LD cycles can drive rhythmic transcription via clock-independent pathways (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wijnen et al., 2006</a>). LD cycles can even drive a rhythm of feeding (<a href=\"#bib80\">Xu et al., 2008</a>), which could lead to cyclic expression of metabolic genes. Nutrients are known to be strong entrainment signals in peripheral tissues; in fact, rhythmic or restricted feeding, even in the absence of a clock, can drive cyclic expression of several fat body genes (<a href=\"#bib79\">Xu et al., 2011</a>).

All <i>Npf-</i>GAL4/UAS-CLK\u0394; <i>tub</i>-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>/+ flies were raised at 18\u00b0C and upon reaching adulthood, control flies were kept at 18\u00b0C, while experimental flies were shifted to the restrictive temperature (30\u00b0C) to induce CLK\u0394 expression. We found that after shifting flies to 30\u00b0C, expression of <i>sxe1</i> remained rhythmic and similar to 18\u00b0C controls, suggesting adult-specific clock ablation in NPF-positive neurons is either incomplete or insufficient to affect <i>sxe1</i> rhythms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). However, this manipulation had a different effect on cyclic expression of <i>Cyp6a21</i>. Robust cycling of <i>Cyp6a21</i> cycling was maintained in control flies kept at the permissive temperature, although the phase was shifted, perhaps due to the different temperature (18\u00b0C) required for this assay. Importantly though, rhythmic expression of <i>Cyp6a21</i> was dampened by adult-specific clock ablation in LN<sub>d</sub> neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). Together these data indicate that clocks in NPF-expressing neurons have differential effects on the expression of cycling fat body genes."

Indeed, NPF was reported to cycle in a subset of NPF-positive neurons, including LN<sub>d</sub>s and LNvs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib25\">He et al., 2013a</a>). NPF regulates a variety of behavioral processes in <i>Drosophila</i> including feeding (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lingo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Itskov and Ribeiro, 2013</a>), courtship (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kim et al., 2013</a>), aggression (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dierick and Greenspan, 2007</a>), and sleep (<a href=\"#bib26\">He et al., 2013b</a>). Therefore, we asked if molecular clocks in NPF-positive neurons mediate free-running behavioral rhythms. We found that flies expressing CLK\u0394 with <i>Npf</i>-GAL4 as well as flies carrying a null mutation in <i>nfpr</i>, the gene encoding the receptor for NPF, display normal rhythms of rest:activity (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In contrast, <i>Dvpdf</i>-GAL4;<i>pdf</i>-GAL80 driving UAS-CLK\u0394 increased the number of arrhythmic flies and slightly lengthened the period of rhythmic flies, further indicating that <i>Dvpdf</i>-GAL4;<i>pdf</i>-GAL80 and <i>Npf</i>-GAL4 do not represent the exact same population of LN<sub>d</sub>s (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). These data suggest that NPF plays at best a minor role in regulating rhythmic locomotor behavior. However, NPF might play a role in other aspects of circadian rhythms, such as circadian control of energy homeostasis."

Driving UAS-<i>npf</i> RNAi under <i>Npf</i>-GAL4 resulted in dampened but still rhythmic <i>sxe1</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Although this manipulation vastly reduced <i>npf</i> levels in fly heads (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), it is possible that very small amounts of NPF can drive some level of cycling; alternatively, knockdown efficiency may have been limited in the NPF-positive clock cells. Thus we tested the null mutant of the sole NPF receptor in <i>Drosophila, npfr</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Garczynski et al., 2002</a>). Our results show <i>sxe1</i> levels do not cycle and are dramatically reduced in <i>npfr</i> mutants, which phenocopies the daily <i>sxe1</i> expression profile of flies expressing either CLK\u0394 or CYC\u0394 under <i>Npf</i>-GAL4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Rhythmic expression of <i>Cyp6a21</i> was also lost in the fat body of <i>npfr</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We speculate that expressing CLK\u0394 under <i>Npf</i>-GAL4 alters the circadian production or release of NPF. Indeed, mRNA analysis of <i>Npf</i>-GAL4/UAS-CLK\u0394 heads showed that <i>npf</i> levels were reduced compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) while cyclic <i>per</i> expression, which arises from clock function in many different cells, was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). This result is consistent with reports of loss of NPF expression in LN<sub>d</sub>s of <i>Clk<sup>jrk</sup></i> brains (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lee et al., 2006</a>). Taken together, these data suggest circadian clocks in NPF-positive cells regulate NPF expression to subsequently drive <i>sxe1</i> and <i>Cyp6a21</i> rhythms in the fat body."

Using the newly developed MetaCycle package (see Materials and methods) and a stringent <i>P-</i>value cutoff of <i>p</i>&lt;0.01 to detect cyclic transcripts, we found that 289 transcripts were cyclic in controls but not in <i>Npy</i> KO, indicating that the oscillation of these transcripts is under the regulation of Npy signaling (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Furthermore, the loss of transcript cycling was generally not accompanied by differences in expression levels; in other words, the median transcript abundance in wild type animals correlated with that in <i>Npy</i> KO (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Based on our <i>Drosophila</i> data and also the fact that Npy regulates <i>Cyp2b10</i> expression, we speculated that Npy might have a broader role in regulating cytochrome P450 gene expression. We examined the microarray data for cyclic P450 transcripts and found several of these genes were not cyclic in <i>Npy</i> KOs. Notably, the microarray data confirmed our qPCR data for <i>Cyp2b10</i> and indicated that <i>Cyp2r1, Cyp17a1</i>, and <i>Cyp2c70</i> transcripts also cycle in wild type but not in <i>Npy</i> KO liver.

We show that clocks in <i>Drosophila</i> NPF-positive neurons drive daily expression of <i>sxe1</i> and <i>Cyp6a21</i>, fat body genes not controlled by the fat body clock.

Our data suggest that in light:dark cycles, the central clock is not required for cycling of the fat body clock, although we cannot exclude an effect on the phase of cycling. However, in constant conditions, the clock in PDF cells influences the fat body clock, as it does the prothoracic gland clock. Future work will determine whether PDF release into the hemolymph influences the fat body clock (<a href=\"#bib68\">Talsma et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Krupp et al., 2013</a>). Why the central clock regulates only some peripheral clocks in the fly is unclear. Unlike other peripheral clocks, the fat body clock modulates behavioral rhythms, specifically the phase of feeding rhythms, in addition to its own physiology (<a href=\"#bib80\">Xu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Seay and Thummel, 2011</a>).

Tissue-specific gene expression patterns are thought to be generated primarily by local clocks; however, few studies have comprehensively evaluated rhythmic expression driven by local clocks versus external factors. A previous comparison of gene expression profiles of flies containing or lacking an intact fat body clock found that the fat body clock only regulates ~60% of all circadian fat body genes (<a href=\"#bib79\">Xu et al., 2011</a>). Here we report that at least some of the other 40% of circadian fat body genes are regulated by clocks located in other tissues. We found that disrupting clocks in NPF-positive cells abolished rhythmic expression of two cytochrome P450 genes, <i>sxe1</i> and <i>Cyp6a21</i>. Since we specifically disrupted the molecular clock by expressing CLK\u0394 or CYC\u0394, only NPF-positive cells containing circadian clock components should have been targeted (LNds). We cannot formally exclude the possibility that expression of CLK\u0394 or CYC\u0394 in non-clock cells or even in the gut (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 1999</a>) contributes to this phenotype; however, the effect of targeting CLK\u0394 to specific LN<sub>d</sub>s with the <i>Dvpdf</i> driver suggests that these cells contribute to the peripheral rhythm phenotype. In addition, even though NPF expression has been reported in both the LN<sub>d</sub>s and LNvs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hermann et al., 2012</a>), it is unlikely the LNvs regulate <i>sxe1</i> rhythms, because disrupting clocks in PDF-positive LNvs does not abolish <i>sxe1</i> oscillations. LN<sub>d</sub>s can be synchronized by inputs from LNvs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Guo et al., 2014</a>), but cell-autonomous entrainment mechanisms in the LN<sub>d</sub>s may limit the influence of LNvs in light:dark cycles, which may explain why ablating clocks in LNvs has a small effect on <i>sxe1</i> expression. Thus, we suggest that the clocks in LN<sub>d</sub>s are required for cycling of <i>sxe1</i> and <i>Cyp6a21</i> expression in the fat body."

We did not detect a role for clocks in NPF cells, nor for the single known NPF receptor, in the regulation of rest:activity, but it is possible that other mechanisms are utilized. However, we show that NPF regulates the expression of circadian genes in the fat body. Consistent with the assertion that NPF is the relevant output for fat body rhythms from NPF-positive cells, we also found that flies lacking functional clocks in these cells display significantly reduced <i>npf</i> levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Interestingly, Lee <i>et al</i>. previously showed that <i>npf</i> mRNA is absent in the LN<sub>d</sub>s of adult male <i>Clk<sup>jrk</sup></i> mutant brains (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lee et al., 2006</a>). This further supports our hypothesis that NPF is regulated by the circadian clock in LN<sub>d</sub>s, and its release from these neurons is necessary for mRNA rhythms of specific fat body genes. However, the effect of NPF on the fat body is likely not direct. Some insect species release NPF into the hemolymph to reach other tissues, but this does not appear to be the case in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib56\">N\u00e4ssel and Wegener, 2011</a>). The NPF receptor may function in clock neurons in the dorsal fly brain (i.e. DN1s), neurons in the suboesophageal ganglion, or neurons innervating the mushroom body (<a href=\"#bib40\">Krashes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">He et al., 2013a</a>). Alternatively, NPF could signal through recently identified neurons downstream of the clock network, which are part of the circadian output circuit driving rest:activity rhythms (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cavanaugh et al., 2014</a>). Although much is known about the neuronal clock network, very little is known about the neurons and signals downstream of the clock network, which make up the output pathways leading to rhythms in behavior and physiology. Our discovery that NPF-positive clock neurons drive rhythmic gene expression in the fat body provides a unique opportunity to investigate the pathway(s) that convey circadian information from the brain to peripheral tissues."

Feeding is known to be a potent stimulus for metabolic clocks, with circadian gene expression in peripheral tissues driven by restricted feeding cycles in both flies and mammals (<a href=\"#bib79\">Xu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gill et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Vollmers et al., 2009</a>). However, under conditions of <i>ad lib</i> food, feeding rhythms in flies are of low amplitude and likely insufficient to drive robust cycling. Consistent with this, while cyclic expression of <i>Cyp6a21</i> can be driven by a restricted feeding paradigm, as can the clock in the fat body, cycling is more robust when this paradigm is conducted in wild type versus clockless animals (<a href=\"#bib79\">Xu et al., 2011</a>), indicating that its regulation is not through feeding alone. Finally, time restricted feeding experiments of mice do not support the idea that restricted feeding drives cycling of <i>Cyp2b10</i> in clockless mice, even though it is sufficient to maintain rhythms of many other liver genes (<a href=\"#bib72\">Vollmers et al., 2009</a>). Thus, while feeding cannot be discounted as an important factor, which may contribute to the cycling of the genes reported here, these genes are unique in their dependence on Npy. Only a limited subset of liver transcripts previously shown to be independent of the liver clock require Npy for cyclic expression (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kornmann et al., 2007a</a>). Similarly, several fly genes, for example <i>sxe2</i> and <i>CG17562</i>, continue to oscillate when CLK\u0394 is expressed under <i>Npf</i>-GAL4 (data not shown). These results suggest there are additional mechanisms regulating circadian rhythms in the fat body/liver. Why would more than one mechanism exist to couple rhythmic gene expression in a specific peripheral tissue to other clocks? One possibility is that different mechanisms regulate distinct phases of circadian gene expression. Alternatively, different mechanisms may couple gene expression to different cell populations, processes, or behaviors."

Overexpression of NPFR in larvae increases foraging behavior as well as consumption of noxious or bitter compounds (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005</a>). Indeed, NPF/Npy signaling is generally associated with an increase in feeding (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lingo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beck, 2006</a>), which can lead to ingestion of toxic substances. Thus, coordination of feeding with expression of detoxification enzymes, such as <i>sxe1, Cyp6a21</i> and <i>Cyp2b10,</i> through NPF/Npy may have evolved to promote survival. Large delays between consumption of noxious substances and their removal could affect an animal\u2019s health; thus, the need for coordination between clocks in processing such substances. Conservation of cytochrome P450 regulation from flies to mammals supports the idea that neural control of detoxification in the periphery promotes organismal fitness (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

In <i>Drosophila</i>, clocks in PDF-positive neurons (LNvs) regulate the clock in the fat body. Similarly, in mammals, clocks in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) have been shown to regulate peripheral clocks such as the liver clock via autonomic innervation, glucocorticoids, body temperature, and feeding. In both the fat body and liver, not all circadian transcripts depend on the local-tissue clock. Clocks in NPF-positive LN<sub>d</sub>s and NPF itself regulate circadian expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the fly fat body. The LNvs can influence other brain clocks (such as the LN<sub>d</sub>s), but are not required for rhythms of fat body transcripts in LD as LN<sub>d</sub>s may entrain directly to light. In mammals, Npy was previously known to be a non-photic signal involved in entraining the SCN. However, the SCN could also influence Npy production or release, which in turn drives rhythmic expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver."

Therefore, expression of these genes may be tightly coordinated to optimize drug metabolism, and speaks to the importance of controlling the timing of drugs that have toxic side effects. The role for Npy reported here suggests it could be a potential target for improving drug efficacy and toxicity. Ultimately, understanding circadian rhythms at a systems level, including interactions between tissues and other physiological systems, will be useful from biological and clinical perspectives."

Expression profiling was done at the Penn Molecular Profiling Facility using Mouse Gene 2.0\u2009ST Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, which also provided the annotation files). For extracting expression values of transcripts, raw CEL files were analyzed with the RMA algorithm (<a href=\"#bib32\">Irizarry, 2003</a>) implemented in the affy package in Bioconductor in R (R 2.14.2) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gautier et al., 2004</a>). The newly developed MetaCycle (version 1.0.0; <a href=\"https://github.com/gangwug/MetaCycleV100.git\">https://github.com/gangwug/MetaCycleV100.git</a>) was used to detect circadian transcripts from time-series expression data in the wild type (WT) and <i>Npy</i> knockout (KO) groups, respectively. Key parameters in MetaCycle were the periodicity detection algorithms, JTK_CYCLE (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hughes et al., 2010</a>) and Lomb-Scargle (<a href=\"#bib22\">Glynn et al., 2006</a>), the period length (set at exactly 24\u2009hr), and the p-value integration method (Fisher\u2019s method, Fisher 1956). Using MetaCycle, we calculated two new features of circadian transcripts, baseline expression level (bEXP) and relative amplitude (rAMP). The former one is defined as the average expression level of a cycling transcript within one period length, and the latter one is a normalized amplitude value with bEXP. Based on analysis results from MetaCycle, expressed transcripts (bEXP larger than 101.6) with a p-value &lt;0.01 in WT and &gt;0.8 in the KO group were considered WT-specific rhythmic transcripts and shown in the heatmap. To generate the heatmap, expression values from replicate libraries in each group were averaged, median normalized by transcript, sorted by phase, and plotted as a heatmap using pheatmap in R."

The authors report that both genes are regulated by NPF-expressing neurons which are themselves regulated by CLK. Moreover, the authors present data showing that the mammalian homolog of NPF (Npy) regulates P450 genes in the mouse liver, suggesting that this mechanism is evolutionary conserved. Although the manuscript provides new and interesting data, we have a concerns regarding the interpretation and significance of the data. These are given below. If these important concerns are addressed, this will be a strong addition to the literature.

Previously, the Sehgal lab has shown that 40% of cycling fat body transcripts oscillate independently from the local fat body clock, i.e., they are driven by factors external to the fat body clock. The situation is vaguely similar to mammalian liver. The claim now is that the neuropeptide NPF is produced from some clock neurons and regulates the fat body clock. However, all three reviewers had only muted enthusiasm for the current version of this paper. They were also unanimous in wanting a lot more data to support the claim and to raise the profile of the paper. It seemed unlikely to all the reviewers that the authors would be able to gather these data in the requisite 2-month time interval recommended by <i>eLife</i>. Moreover, the authors run a substantial risk that the data will change major conclusions of the paper. So with these issues in mind, the reviewers agreed that a rejection decision is more appropriate than revise and that the authors return to <i>eLife</i> with a new manuscript if that is the route they choose; this will obviate any temporal issues."

The story is that the neuropeptide NPF is produced from some clock neurons, and it regulates the fat body clock. However, the focus is on a single fat body transcript (out of the 40% that have been reported to oscillate independently from the fat body clock), and it is unclear that this result is applicable to a wider set of mRNAs. The data also make me concerned about developmental effects. Moreover, I am not convinced that any aspect of the fat body clock is influenced by NPF \u2013 as distinct from some other effect on gene expression of a rather limited subset of fat body mRNAs. The authors also admit that the effect of NPF on the fat body is almost certainly indirect (through feeding?), so we do not know anything mechanistic about how NPF is exercising its influence."

They have systematically addressed this issue by examining the fat-body oscillation of <i>sxe</i> genes in fly strains lacking circadian clock in specific neurons and have found the NPF expressing neurons and the NPF signaling system somehow drives peripheral oscillations. To test the relevance of this regulation in mammals, they have tested <i>Cyp10b2</i> gene expression in the liver of NPY knockout mice and have shown dampened oscillation.

The reviewer is correct in that adult ablation of NPF cells does not affect <i>sxe1</i> rhythms. However, it does affect cycling of the other cytochrome P450 gene we studied, <i>cyp6a21</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>).

The story is that the neuropeptide NPF is produced from some clock neurons, and it regulates the fat body clock. However, the focus is on a single fat body transcript (out of the 40% that have been reported to oscillate independently from the fat body clock), and it is unclear that this result is applicable to a wider set of mRNAs. The data also make me concerned about developmental effects. Moreover, I am not convinced that any aspect of the fat body clock is influenced by NPF \u2013 as distinct from some other effect on gene expression of a rather limited subset of fat body mRNAs. The authors also admit that the effect of NPF on the fat body is almost certainly indirect (through feeding?), so we do not know anything mechanistic about how NPF is exercising its influence.</i> We agree with the reviewer that NPF does not influence the <i>clock</i> in the fat body, but rather a \u201climited subset of fat body mRNAs\u201d. Indeed, we make the case in the manuscript that the clock is <i>not</i>affected, as <i>per</i> cycling is normal when the clock is disrupted in NPF cells. ~30 transcripts in the fat body cycle independently of the fat body clock, and appear to be controlled by different mechanisms. For instance, in other work we have found that cycling at least one of these transcripts requires insulin-producing cells. The transcripts reported in this manuscript, <i>sxe1</i> and a second characterized in the revised manuscript, <i>cyp6a21</i>, depend on NPF. As noted below, we have now conducted experiments to address the developmental issue raised by the reviewer. The identification of NPF as a neural factor that drives rhythmic expression in a metabolic tissue provides a mechanism for a longstanding question of interest in the circadian field, namely how coordinated action of clocks in different tissues regulates circadian outputs (metabolic gene expression in this case)."

I think that determining whether time-restricted feeding (TRF) can have an effect in the phase and amplitude of sxe1 rhythms in the NPF-DClock flies will help determine whether the observed effects could be due to secondary effects related to feeding or not. Even understanding how TRF affect sxe1 oscillations could be illuminating in this aspect. I looked into the Gill et al. manuscript, but unhappily sxe1 was not found among the oscillating mRNAs neither in heads or periphery. This is likely due to difference in strains."

Although food, temperature cycle, and light can drive oscillations in the absence of a local peripheral clock, the authors focused on specific transcripts that cannot be driven by these stimuli and hence were dependent on clocks elsewhere. They have systematically addressed this issue by examining the fat-body oscillation of sxe genes in fly strains lacking circadian clock in specific neurons and have found the NPF expressing neurons and the NPF signaling system somehow drives peripheral oscillations. To test the relevance of this regulation in mammals, they have tested Cyp10b2 gene expression in the liver of NPY knockout mice and have shown dampened oscillation. The authors imply that this is the first time a brain derived neuropeptide drives circadian oscillation in a peripheral organ and suggest NPY may be targeted to improve circadian regulation of xenobiotic metabolism."

We did examine the response of <i>sxe1</i> to restricted feeding and found that it is not affected any more than <i>per</i> (see response to Reviewer 2, and <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a>). In addition, as noted above, the effect of NPF on <i>sxe1</i> is developmental and, therefore, not a direct response to feeding. Regarding <i>Cyp6a21</i>, we showed previously that while it can be driven by restricted feeding (RF) in <i>Clk<sup>jrk</sup> </i>flies the rhythm is not as robust as seen upon RF in wild type flies (Xu et al., 2011). Thus, it does not appear to be driven by a feeding cycle alone. Finally, the Panda database (<a href=\"http://circadian.salk.edu/about.html\">http://circadian.salk.edu/about.html</a>) does not indicate restoration of <i>Cyp2b10</i> cycling by restricted feeding of clockless mice. While all these data do not exclude a role of feeding, they indicate that NPF/NPY likely does not act through feeding alone to drive expression of these peripheral genes. We note too that only a limited subset of circadian genes that are independent of the liver clock depend on NPY. If NPY were driving gene expression through rhythmic feeding alone, it would impact most liver genes. The potential role of feeding is now fully discussed in the Discussion section."

A recent paper from Chang's lab has shown the gut plays a profound role in driving liver circadian gene expression. Therefore, it is premature to state the CNS expression of NPY is driving liver circadian gene expression.

Along the same line, it will be worth examining whether NPF system is expressed in the peripheral organs of flies.</i> We acknowledge that the mouse data do not exclude a role for NPY function in the periphery. This possibility is now mentioned. However, in the fly, our data with the DvPdf driver show that LN<sub>d</sub>s are important for cycling of <i>sxe1</i>. In addition, the previous work of Jae Park and colleagues (2006) showed that in <i>Clk<sup>jrk</sup> </i>mutants <i>npf</i> is downregulated in LN<sub>d</sub>s, but not in other NPF-positive cells.
