Although several genome-wide studies have focused on finding and locating enhancers in the genomes, the fundamental principles governing their internal architecture and <i>cis</i>-regulatory grammar remain elusive. Here, we describe an extensive, quantitative perturbation analysis targeting the dorsal-ventral patterning gene regulatory network (GRN) controlled by <i>Drosophila</i> NF-\u03baB homolog Dorsal. To understand transcription factor interactions on enhancers, we employed an ensemble of mathematical models, testing effects of cooperativity, repression, and factor potency. Models trained on the dataset correctly predict activity of evolutionarily divergent regulatory regions, providing insights into spatial relationships between repressor and activator binding sites. Importantly, the collective predictions of sets of models were effective at novel enhancer identification and characterization. Our study demonstrates how experimental dataset and modeling can be effectively combined to provide quantitative insights into <i>cis</i>-regulatory information on a genome-wide scale."

Although several genome-wide studies have focused on finding and locating enhancers in the genomes, the fundamental principles governing their internal architecture and <i>cis</i>-regulatory grammar remain elusive. Here, we describe an extensive, quantitative perturbation analysis targeting the dorsal-ventral patterning gene regulatory network (GRN) controlled by <i>Drosophila</i> NF-\u03baB homolog Dorsal. To understand transcription factor interactions on enhancers, we employed an ensemble of mathematical models, testing effects of cooperativity, repression, and factor potency. Models trained on the dataset correctly predict activity of evolutionarily divergent regulatory regions, providing insights into spatial relationships between repressor and activator binding sites. Importantly, the collective predictions of sets of models were effective at novel enhancer identification and characterization. Our study demonstrates how experimental dataset and modeling can be effectively combined to provide quantitative insights into <i>cis</i>-regulatory information on a genome-wide scale."

For example, so-called enhancer regions of DNA contain several binding sites for transcription factors, and this binding activates gene transcription.

This technique involves systematically mutating the enhancer to remove different combinations of transcription factor binding sites and quantitatively investigating the effect this has on gene activity. A large set of mathematical models were then trained using this data and shown to correctly predict the activity of a range of other gene regulatory regions. The collective predictions of the models identified new enhancer regions and revealed details about how different types of transcription factor binding sites are arranged within enhancers."

Despite more than three decades of progress, surprisingly little is known about constraints on internal structural organization of binding sites ('grammar') within these elements (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dickel et al., 2013</a>). Some enhancers show little evolutionary variation, and permit no change in transcription factor binding sites without catastrophic effects on function (<a href=\"#bib59\">Thanos and Maniatis, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kim and Maniatis, 1997</a>). Many developmental enhancers, however, demonstrate a more flexible deployment of binding sites, thus functionally conserved elements can exhibit a large degree of evolutionary variation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Junion et al., 2012</a>). Although high-throughput studies have dramatically increased our knowledge of genome-wide transcription factor occupancy and transcript expression, we have a limited ability to interpret the functional relevance of quantitative aspects of protein binding or DNA sequence variation. A quantitative understanding of the internal enhancer grammar of <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements will provide researchers with powerful tools to better understand the significance of genetic variation that is observed within and between species, critical for exploitation of burgeoning genomic resources. Thermodynamic models employ tools from statistical physics to model gene activity, providing a framework for understanding transcription factor interactions with specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bintu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ay and Arnosti, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dresch and Drewell, 2012</a>) Previous efforts at thermodynamic modeling in eukaryotic systems have demonstrated that diverse types of data can be fit, providing at least a qualitative level of prediction (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zinzen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Segal et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">He et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Drewell et al., 2014</a>). However, earlier studies relied on heterogeneous and low-resolution datasets, inherently limiting modeling effectiveness. In addition, few types of models were tested, reducing the chance that essential properties of transcription factor interactions will be captured."

To harness the potential of thermodynamic modeling approaches, we developed an in-depth enhancer perturbation analysis that takes advantage of the quantitative setting of the <i>Drosophila</i> blastoderm embryo. The <i>rhomboid (rho</i>) enhancer directs gene expression in the presumptive neuroectoderm under the control of the activator Dorsal, a homolog of NF-\u03baB. The Twist activator and Snail repressor provide additional essential inputs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To extract fundamental information from this data set, we created and fit a comprehensive set of thermodynamic models designed to capture likely interactions between transcription factors as they interact with the enhancer. An extensive set of other coordinately-regulated Dorsal/Twist/Snail target genes was then used to assess the power of this modeling approach for interpretation of <i>cis</i>-regulatory variation."

Expression is excluded from the mesoderm (ventral region) by Snail, a short-range repressor that interferes with activators located within ~100 bp of a Snail binding site (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gray et al., 1994</a>). We systematically mutated all activator and repressor binding sites in <i>rho</i> neurectodermal enhancer, removing Dorsal or Twist sites individually or in pairs to diminish activation, and removing multiple Snail sites to reduce repression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

Strikingly, despite the differences in predicted binding affinities and relative positions of the motifs, the elimination of any site individually had similar quantitative effects, reducing gene expression to approximately 60% of the peak wild-type level (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). In contrast to this uniform picture, the impact of mutation of combinations of two Dorsal or Twist binding sites was highly variable, ranging from slightly lower expression to almost complete loss of activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Overall, the double activator site mutagenesis revealed a complex picture of the contributions of activator sites to gene expression. We hypothesize that the variable effects of different pairwise mutations, as opposed to the rather similar effects of individual site loss, indicates that there are multiple and distinct thresholds for specific biochemical events occurring on the enhancer. In contrast to the perturbation of Dorsal and Twist elements, removal of Snail repressor binding sites revealed stark differences in the significance of individual motifs for overall activity. Mutation of all four Snail sites caused pervasive expression in the mesoderm, as expected, while constructs with a single intact Snail2 or Snail3 site showed substantial but not complete repression (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Snail1 and Snail4 motifs were not nearly as effective at mediating repression, although these have similar binding affinities (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>).

Such complexity is a familiar facet of <i>cis</i>-element mutagenesis studies (<a href=\"#bib58\">Swanson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Evans et al., 2012</a>). To extract the non-intuitive, quantitative information about transcription factor function and interactions from these results, we created an extensive set of quantitative models. Based on the likely importance of cooperativity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kazemian et al., 2013</a>), we tested models that incorporated a variety of conceptions of distance-dependent homotypic and heterotypic cooperativity, as well as different distance-dependent 'quenching' or repressive interactions between repressors and activators (<a href=\"#bib60\">Veitia, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wagner, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kulkarni and Arnosti, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arnosti et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Barolo and Levine, 1997</a>). We systematically tested continuous and step functions to determine possible distance relationships affecting interactions. In all, 15 formulations for cooperativity and eight formulations for quenching were employed (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Combining these two types of formulations resulted in 120 different models, which were trained on the quantitative expression data of the 38 enhancer variants. Parameters were estimated using CMA-ES, a global genetic algorithm, and overall performance was calculated from the fit to all constructs, using root mean square error (RMSE) as the objective function (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hansen et al., 2003</a>). Examination of model performance at three levels \u2013 global RMSE, construct-by-construct RMSE, and specific portions of the expression patterns - provided complementary insights into the nature of how the training data are fit, and the potential utility of the models on other enhancer sequences."

Additionally, there were measureable differences between models with identical numbers of parameters, suggesting that the different formulation of the schemes was interrogating aspects of enhancer grammar critical for the <i>rho</i> enhancer variants we were fitting.

Compared to fitting on the complete data set, most models showed only a modest decrease in performance in predicting left out sets (left column, complete data set, right column, modeling on randomly selected partial data sets). In contrast, selective removal of specific data sets corresponding to one type of mutagenic perturbation (all constructs with mutation to Snail sites, all constructs with mutations to Dorsal sites, etc.) led to parameter sets that were generally significantly less able to fit left-out data (central column). The comprehensive perturbation of the different types of motifs on the enhancers was thus an essential aspect of good model fitting. The low-performing model C4Q4 actually performed better during cross-validation, likely because the parameters determined from the original run do not represent a global minimum. (<b>B</b>) Construct-specific RMSE scores illustrate impact of specific portions of the data set on model performance. Here, predictions for 38 constructs are plotted for the 24 models that were fit on a data set lacking all Snail mutant constructs.

The models, represented by rows, were ranked from best to worst based on global performance, and individual fits for each of the 38 <i>rho</i> enhancer variants were plotted in columns. The higher ranked models (blue rows) have generally lower RMSEs across all constructs, and groups of models with similar structures had similar patterns of better or worse performance on particular constructs. Some constructs were fit generally less well by most models. Those constructs containing the wild-type ensemble of activators (columns 1, 25, 28, 32) were among those that were less well fit than the bulk of constructs, from which we had removed activator sites; apparently the generally narrower neuroectodermal expression pattern of those constructs with some activator sites removed drove overall parameter fitting. Individual plots of the measured and predicted activity of individual enhancer modules show that some error arises from the models underestimating the activator potential specifically in more dorsal regions of the embryo, where activator concentration is limiting (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; e.g. construct 1: DMRW). The lower quality fit for these constructs does not represent a model failure; rather, these constructs are likely to be especially informative for activator function, and a modeling effort that entirely lacks these types of constructs would be more over-fit and less informative than the present one. Further examination of individual plots for specific genes provides additional insight into the nature of which features influence RMSE scores the most (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). A top-ranking model (C14Q5) accurately captures high and low levels of Snail repression, deviating only in underestimating the expression of <i>rho</i> in regions most limiting for Dorsal and Twist. An intermediate-scoring model (C8Q7) was partially successful in capturing general trends of activation with occasional overestimation of activity. This model misestimated Snail repression in some cases as well. The lowest performing model (C4Q4) suffered from poor estimation in Dorsal/Twist activity, as well as a general absence of repression by Snail."

We used cross-validation, a statistical technique in which segments of the data set are left out during model fitting, to reveal possible overfitting, and determine the impact of certain portions of the data set on overall success in fitting. We performed cross-validation for the 24 models studied above both by leaving out specific parts of the dataset with common attributes (e.g. all Dorsal or Snail site mutations) as well as by randomly removing portions of the dataset. We used these two complementary approaches to not only test how much data is needed for the model fitting to be successful, but also to emphasize how important experimental design is in a study such as this one. Some studies rely on rely on saturation mutagenesis to achieve the same effect, but testing thousands of variants is impractical in this system, so a targeted survey was called for (<a href=\"#bib62\">White et al., 2013</a>). As anticipated, models were in general less able to fit constructs that were left out of the dataset, indicating the contribution that these particular enhancer constructs made to the fitting (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Despite similar performance on the entire dataset, individual models showed differing levels of sensitivity to changes in the scope of the data set used for model fitting. For instance, RMSE values for C13Q5 were modestly increased by either systematic or random leave-sets-out treatment, while C11Q4 was more dramatically impacted. In general, removal of entire classes of constructs had a more profound impact than removal of randomly selected constructs."

Collectively, the scope of mutations assayed, targeting recognized Twist, Dorsal, and Snail sites, was sufficient to provide the required information to the modeling effort.

Several broad trends emerged from analysis of parameter values across many model types, revealing possible biological implications for the modeled enhancer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). First, overall model performance was improved by specifying separate parameters for activator and repressor cooperativity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; C1-9 vs. C10-C15). In these latter models, repressor-repressor cooperativities were consistently small, implying that different Snail sites did not show more than additive contributions, a finding that is consistent with the induction of localized chromatin compaction by this class of short-range repressor, which may interfere with simultaneous interactions by repressors (<a href=\"#bib38\">Li and Arnosti, 2011</a>). Activator-activator cooperativities were in contrast uniformly high, and in general did not show sharp distance dependencies. Such interactions may represent indirect interactions among activators, and may reflect joint repulsion of nucleosomes, or cooperative attraction of coactivators important for engaging the transcriptional machinery. The loose cooperative interactions of activators would explain the need for clustering of these proteins\u2019 binding sites without strong constraints on their exact positioning, a flexibility that is seen with many developmental enhancers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Arnosti and Kulkarni, 2005</a>). This long-distance cooperativity contrasts with the short-range interactions often included in thermodynamic descriptions of transcription factor cooperativity (<a href=\"#bib52\">Segal et al., 2008</a>). A second trend noted in many but not all models was the distance-dependence of transcriptional repression, a feature inferred from previous studies of the Knirps, Snail, and Giant short-range repressors (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gray et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arnosti et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hewitt et al., 1999</a>); (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Thus, the overall landscape of estimated parameters both reflects certain known aspects of repression, and sheds light on activator cooperativity, which may involve primarily indirect, not rigidly constrained interactions in this system."

As shown with these three examples, most parameters exhibited much higher second-order than first-order effects, indicating that compensatory relationships among parameters are predominant. Even with such compensation, certain types of parameters (e.g. relatively high activator cooperativities) are preferred (also seen in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Model structures influenced the first- and second-order sensitivities; models using quenching schemes Q2-4 exhibited a significant degree of first order sensitivity for the Dorsal scaling factor (<b>B</b>), while almost every other model combination showed a significant extent of first-order sensitivity for the Snail scaling factor (<b>A</b>, <b>C</b>).

To test their efficacy, we first asked whether the perturbation analysis and modeling of <i>rho</i> was capable of uncovering a key property of modular enhancers in the embryo, namely the short range of transcriptional repressors that prevents 'cross-talk' with other nearby elements (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gray et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Courey and Jia, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Payankaulam et al., 2010</a>). Previous work showed that Snail protein is representative of this major functional class of repressors, in studies that involved moving Snail binding sites within transcriptional regulatory regions (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gray et al., 1994</a>). Our perturbation dataset did not involve moving Snail binding sites around, however, the top third of models in our test set were able to accurately capture the effects of loss of Snail sites from a 700 bp native <i>rho</i> element, as well as correctly characterize modified enhancers in which novel Snail sites were inserted into active as well as inactive locations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). To determine whether modeling from <i>rho</i> can be broadly extended to other regulatory elements, we measured the quantitative output of other enhancers targeted by Dorsal and Twist, and compared their expression patterns with the predictions of a spectrum of our models. Heterologous elements from <i>D. melanogaster</i> and homologous <i>rho</i> enhancers from other <i>Drosophila</i> species were successfully modeled by the models trained on the <i>rho</i> dataset (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

To determine whether models would be able to identify and correctly quantitatively score enhancers embedded in general genomic sequences, we tested the panel of models on 30\u201340 kb regions flanking a number of developmental genes. The regions were tiled in 500 bp overlapping sequences and predictions generated with parameters from the <i>rho</i> dataset fitting. Analysis of the neuroectodermal <i>brk</i> and <i>sog</i> genes, as well as the more widely expressed <i>twi</i> gene showed that most intergenic sequences did not give rise to any appreciable predicted expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To help one visualize how well the models agreed (or disagreed) on particular regions, average predictions from all 24 models were also generated for each 500 bp window, and plotted along with the standard deviation above and below the mean. A strong consensus among the 24 models for activity was found in two regions flanking the <i>brk</i> gene; these regions include mapped embryonic enhancers (primary and shadow) that are known to bind Dorsal and Twist in vivo (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Some regions were less uniformly predicted by the models, and in these cases there was less uniformity about the prediction for mesodermal or neuroectodermal expression, indicating that Snail activity was variably predicted. These predictions tended to agree well with genomic protein occupancy information, although there were some regions predicted as enhancers where there was no protein occupancy measured. In contrast, there were fewer predicted active elements in the region surrounding <i>even-skipped (eve</i>) locus, which is expressed in an anterior-posterior pattern independent of Dorsal/Twist. In addition, for intergenic regions flanking <i>eve</i>, there was greater variability among models in predicted expression levels, patterns of expression, and whether an element was even likely to be active (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Similar results were noted for neuroectodermal and mesodermal-specific <i>short gastrulation (sog</i>) and <i>twist (twi</i>) genes respectively, as well as the non-target gene <i>fushi tarazu</i> (<i>ftz</i>) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The use of multiple models as a predictive 'jury' may help overcome the overfitting that is inherent in modeling, as the effects of such bias for a given model may be more or less prominent in different contexts. The ensemble approach of averaging the 24 model predictions provides a convenient metric for transcriptional potential predictions, yet the graphic display of the individual models also serves an important role, to highlight particular regions where there is a high degree of uniformity about the prediction (e.g. primary and shadow <i>brk</i> enhancers) and those in which the models diverge sharply (<i>eve</i> proximal region)."

Many models simply rely on the number of sites to infer some level of activity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kazemian et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Heintzman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bonn et al., 2012</a>). Our study indicates that the arrangement and quality of transcription factor binding sites contains an essential common 'grammar' of <i>cis</i>-regulatory regions that is shared across distinct regulatory elements; this stands in contrast to recent studies suggesting that in some cases transcription factors may recognize their target sequences primarily through protein-protein rather than protein-DNA interactions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kulkarni and Arnosti, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Junion et al., 2012</a>). Our models were biologically constrained, leading to structural similarities between the different model formulations. Although this may contribute to the clustering of parameter values we have observed, given the overall quality of predictions across the genome, we believe these models and parameter values to be biologically informative. Predictions of enhancer activity from sequence alone remain a challenge, but our study clearly shows that with a suitable training set, there are identifiable aspects of enhancer composition that allow for functional insights of mesodermal and neuroectodermal genes of the Dorsal regulon. Models such as these can guide future studies that mine population- and species-level variation of genomic sequences (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mackay, 2010</a>)."

As we determined when applying these models to genome discovery, using a panel of models provides a more robust platform for interpreting possible regulatory information; the particular parameter sets developed from fitting the <i>rho</i> perturbation data may represent a certain level of overfitting with respect to all potential Dorsal/Twist target enhancers. These errors are partially cancelled out when the predictions of several dozen models can be evaluated, providing in effect a type of 'weather report' showing a certain chance of regulation at each element. Here, we have also used an ensemble approach to combine these predictions, averaging model predictions; an approach similar to that which was implemented in a recent study by Samee et. al. (<a href=\"#bib50\">Samee et al., 2015</a>). However, in their work they use a single thermodynamic model formulation and average the predictions obtained from different parameter sets with similar fits to their perturbation data."

Specifically, for Dorsal and Twist, key regulators of dorsal-ventral polarity in the early embryo, our modeling predicts strong distance-independent homo- and heterotypic cooperativity between activators, but weak cooperativity between the Snail short-range repressors. These effects are likely linked to chromatin-based activities of these proteins (<a href=\"#bib38\">Li and Arnosti, 2011</a>). Previous, simpler models suggest that direct protein-protein interactions within a range of ~50 bp are likely to dominate such functional interactions (<a href=\"#bib52\">Segal et al., 2008</a>). The extensive survey of model structure allowed us to reject assumptions this simplifying assumption. These predicted properties of transcription factor activity were robustly observed for differently structured models, making us confident that they are biologically relevant and not the result of overfitting, and the initial application of models to genomic sequences points to the future use of these models in genomic characterization of the Dorsal-Twist regulon. Our ability to gain insight into the transcriptional landscape of this network is a proof of concept demonstrating the utility of such a modeling approach for identifying regulatory relationships in other systems."

Nonetheless, future models will incorporate such additional layers of information in more complex treatments, such as including basal chromatin patterns to bias the accessibility of transcription factor sites (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bryant et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Floer et al., 2010</a>). Our study has addressed only a fraction of the diversity of factors present in the fly embryo; we deliberately focused on the early Dorsal regulon for the richness of quantitative resources available to it, including transcription factor concentrations, binding specificity of trans-acting factors, and genomic data on in vivo targets. With continuing advances in genomics and high-throughput technologies, quantitative modeling can extend our knowledge of other regulons, building on extensive descriptions of gene and protein expression, genomic protein occupancy, and genomic variation. A greater promise for modeling the quantitative grammar of genomes will be in 'personalized genomics', in which investigators predict the effects of sequence variation in human populations, and their physiological relevance in development and disease (<a href=\"#bib12\">Corradin and Scacheri, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Newman and Young, 2010</a>)."

The 488\u00a0nm argon laser was used for excitation of the Alexa 488; the 559\u00a0nm solid-state laser was used for excitation of the Alexa 555, and the 635\u00a0nm solid-state laser was used for excitation of the TOPRO-3. Emitted fluorescence was detected using a 500\u2013545\u00a0nm band pass filter for detection of the Alexa 488, a 570\u2013625\u00a0nm band pass filter for detection of Alexa 555, and a 655-755\u00a0nm band pass filter for detection of TOPRO-3. The pinhole aperture was set to 1.0 Airy unit. PMT voltage was set at maximum for images obtained from embryos transgenic for the wild-type <i>rho</i>NEE enhancer, avoiding saturation of signal intensities. Other constructs were imaged subsequently on a single day without changing any of the microscope settings. Embryos were imaged at a scan speed of 12.9\u2009s/scan and a Kalman average of 2. A total of 21\u201330 confocal images through the Z thickness were acquired for each embryo with a Z-step interval of 1.16\u2009\u03bcm per step. CLSM image data was stored as three separate stacks and projections of images for each channel. The section dimensions were 333\u2009mm in length and width, and 1.73\u2009mm in depth. Fluorescence pixels were recorded as 12-bit images and stored as TIFF files. To control for fading of signal post-staining, <i>rho</i> constructs containing the wild-type ensemble of activators were stained in parallel and used to normalize overall signal intensity for each imaging day. Stained embryos were imaged within a week to minimize loss of signal. Differences in probe bleaching, laser intensity, gain settings of the CCD etc. all impact overall signal intensity. For the 348 control images captured over 53 imaging sessions, the range of average peak intensities, prior to any background subtraction or normalization, was 56.8 \u2013 255 units (only 3 were at 255, saturation value). The mean was 138.0, with a standard deviation of 36.8. Thus, for the large majority of captured signals, the day-to-day differences in intensities were not very great, and normalization procedures were not changing values by large factors. The background signals from non-expressing portions of the embryos were 52.4 +/- 23.8 (S.D.), thus considerably (2X) below the signal; and in all cases the strong signals measured on any day were well above background measured on any day."

For background subtraction, analysis of background signals from non-transgenic, <i>yw</i> flies showed a parabolic-shape (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bergman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Myasnikova et al., 2005</a>), therefore a quadratic function was fit to the region of the signal representing the dorsal ectoderm, where <i>rho</i> is not expressed, and subtracted from the raw fluorescent signal. To normalize signals, values from each image were normalized to the average peak (&gt;95%) wild-type signal obtained during the same imaging session. This procedure allows for images to be compared for a single construct imaged on multiple days, as well as to compare intensity from one construct to another. The average intensity profiles, along with standard error calculations are given in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>."

Additional models with 'binned' distances were also considered. For each of the binned schemes, we used a simpler form in which all homotypic interactions are parameterized with the same values, and a more complex form where each type of protein interaction for a given bin size receives distinct parameters.

This RMSE was calculated using the 17 discrete expression points, as described above, and corresponding data points coming from the model predictions. Note that we used these 17 points, taken from 0\u201340% of the DV axis, and RMSE which gives each point equal weight, because we wanted to focus on the region of the embryo in which varying expression levels were observed and use the same scoring method with no bias across all construct. Due to the stochastic nature of starting points and fixed maximum number of runs for CMA-ES, estimations were run five times, which was empirically found to be sufficient to produce similar, minimal RMSE values for at least three of the runs in at least 47% of cases."

The modeling strategy is somewhat unusual, and while it's presented fairly clearly in the text, I don't find the figures always give great insight. However, for most aspects, I think readers can assess what they did and draw their own conclusions about the validity of the modeling approach and whether it provided useful insights.

They analyze the variation in this full set, reporting that their mean peak expression was 138+/- 36.8, and that background was 52.4 +/- 23.8. They are thus seeing about 2X expression above background for their WT controls across all stains by this metric.

The latter seems to be the case based on <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> where black dots are specific measurements. How/why were these points selected? The output also appears to be at discrete points based on this Figure, where red lines are predictions and I am assuming that the line is from linking together these discrete points. Finally, the RMSE score they use equally weights errors in regions of high expression and low expression. Some alternative scores have been used in other work to emphasize other features of expression patterns (for example the Sinha group has used the weighted Pattern Generating Potential). It is not necessary to score their models differently, but they should discuss the trade-offs of their particular scoring scheme. And how is the RMSE score calculated? Is it done on the continuous data (red lines in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> vs. continuous expression measurements), or on the point by point data as above? I could not find this information in the main text or the methods. I suggest that it is included in the main text as a verbal description of their procedures, and any additional information be put in the methods. It also seems possible and potentially useful to include their experimental error in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, to allow comparison of biological variability against their model performance."

One of the main claims of the paper is the ability to estimate biophysical parameters, this claim has to be convincingly demonstrated. Few comments from the reviewers on this issue: \"The concept of ensemble of models is not new and is the subject both of Bayesian statistics (which is essentially about learning how much we can trust each possible model) and non-Bayesian formulations (e.g., mixture-of-experts models). I suspect that employing one of these methodologies would actually lead to a useful predictive rule which might apply on the non-rho enhancers.

We do see that performance for individual models drops as we leave out portions of the training dataset, but this is mostly apparent when we partition the training set in a non-random manner. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, models performed well with five-fold random cross validation, but leaving out all of the data from specific classes of perturbations (e.g. removal of repressor sites) had a significant impact on RMSE. We include the \u201cnonrandom\u201d partitioning to indicate how important different types of perturbations are; some studies rely on saturation mutagenesis to achieve the same effect, but testing thousands of variants is impractical in this system, so a targeted survey was called for (White et al., 2013). We have revised the Results section to emphasize this point. As the reviewer noted, the structures of the models are related, which may lead to similarities in identified parameters. We agree that this similarity of models may indeed produce such effects; the reason that we did not try vastly different models is that certain aspects of rho binding proteins are experimentally known, based on extensive empirical research. For instance, we know that Snail is a short-range repressor, thus we used models in which it would be possible to recover such activity, depending on estimated parameters. (However, we could also recover parameters that would be consistent with long-range action, depending on recovered parameters for longer distance intervals). Similarly, strong evidence indicates that Twist and Dorsal are activators, and can show cooperative action, thus models in which the proteins had inverted regulatory activities (as explored by Jaeger and Reinitz on less well-characterized settings) were not included. Our models are not too narrowly structured, merely filling in some parameters for highly detailed biochemical mechanisms, however; complex processes of transcriptional control are subsumed in the single \u201cactivity\u201d parameter, which is an appropriate simplifying role for models. Given these limitations, the diversity of the models that was generated helped identify general trends that point to possible important biological properties. For example, we noted a substantial increase in performance for models in which we separately assess activator and repressor cooperativity, indicating that these proteins may have different cooperative potentials."

We find that most parameters showed high overall sensitivity, indicating their importance in driving model fitting, and high second-order values, indicating that there are interdependencies between these factors (only the Snail activity parameter showed high first-order sensitivities in some models). This latter finding of higher second-order sensitivities is not at all surprising, and it was a factor that we recognized embarking on this study, because the mechanism of transcription involves processes that all contribute to the final output, and research on native biological systems has demonstrated how transcriptional output can be set by complementary contributions of cooperativity or factor potency, for instance. We were interested in determining how useful such models would be despite some degree of parameter interdependence, which is borne out by success in predicting novel enhancers. We do think that the clustering of many parameter values across many models is biologically informative. For instance, the tendency for long-range activator cooperativity vs. low repressor cooperativity is likely to be informative, but this must be tested. We revised the Discussion to note that structural similarities of models may also drive such effects, as the reviewer pointed out."

The plot does not show a strong positive correlation between this simple measure of similarity and modeling success. This result indicates that the simple measure of enhancer relatedness by global feature similarity is insufficient to predict activity. Indeed, the features that dictate enhancer output are very specific and context-dependent. Experimental work has shown individual cases in which subtle changes in a few residues are sufficient to strongly affect enhancer output, while at the same time highly divergent DNA sequences can mediate essentially identical tissue-specific expression of different genes (Crocker and Erives, 2008)."

They analyze the variation in this full set, reporting that their mean peak expression was 138+/- 36.8, and that background was 52.4 +/- 23.8.

We explicitly tested the importance of exact spacing relationships for the activators by generating models that permitted fine-scale differentiation of protein binding sites, however, most models with separate repressor and activator cooperativity parameters tended to high, and distance-independent positive cooperativity for activators, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. We subsequently focus on a single subset of 24 models for sensitivity and cross-validation, showing that broad properties apply across this set of models (and doubtless the entire 120 related models), such as demonstration that certain types of perturbations (e.g. hitting both activator and repressor sites) were critical for optimal fitting, that the overall depth of perturbation was sufficient for obtaining quantitative information about the \u201ctranscriptional grammar\u201d of this enhancer, and that on most models, parameter was observed. Thus, in the end we make our major conclusions about two groups of models; the entire set, and the representative subset of 24 (as well as the demonstration that an \u201caverage\u201d ensemble captures some, but not all useful information about novel genes that are scanned in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>."
