Here, we studied interactions between the microbiota and indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits cyclooxygenases (COX) -1 and -2. Indomethacin was tested in both acute and chronic exposure models in mice at clinically relevant doses, which suppressed production of COX-1- and COX-2-derived prostaglandins and caused small intestinal (SI) damage. Deep sequencing analysis showed that indomethacin exposure was associated with alterations in the structure of the intestinal microbiota in both dosing models. Perturbation of the intestinal microbiome by antibiotic treatment altered indomethacin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which is probably the result of reduced bacterial \u03b2-glucuronidase activity. Humans show considerable inter-individual differences in their microbiota and their responses to indomethacin \u2014 thus, the drug-microbe interactions described here provide candidate mediators of individualized drug responses."

Here, we studied interactions between the microbiota and indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits cyclooxygenases (COX) -1 and -2. Indomethacin was tested in both acute and chronic exposure models in mice at clinically relevant doses, which suppressed production of COX-1- and COX-2-derived prostaglandins and caused small intestinal (SI) damage. Deep sequencing analysis showed that indomethacin exposure was associated with alterations in the structure of the intestinal microbiota in both dosing models. Perturbation of the intestinal microbiome by antibiotic treatment altered indomethacin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which is probably the result of reduced bacterial \u03b2-glucuronidase activity. Humans show considerable inter-individual differences in their microbiota and their responses to indomethacin \u2014 thus, the drug-microbe interactions described here provide candidate mediators of individualized drug responses."

This is because the interactions between the gut bacteria and indomethacin modifies the inhibitory effect of indomethacin on enzymes known as COX-1 and COX-2. This may explain why some drugs work better in some people than others, as different people have different bacteria in their guts."

Previous work has shown the influence of the host molecular clock on gut bacteria.

However, drug treatment explains more of the observed variation in the indomethacin group (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.22, ADONIS test) than in PEG400 group (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.05, ADONIS test), indicating indomethacin had a greater effect in modulating fecal microbiota composition than PEG400. The influence of indomethacin was not due to changes in microbial biomasses, since there were no significant changes in 16S rRNA gene copy number between PEG400 and indomethacin groups, as measured by qPCR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). There may be a vehicle-induced decrease in microbial biomass, likely due to its purgative effect. Indomethacin also induced an increase in the Shannon Index (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, right), without influencing observed species in the fecal microbiota, suggestive of an increase in evenness associated with drug exposure."

Detection of indomethacin and indomethacin-glucuronide was confirmed by incubating samples with or without \u03b2-glucuronidase. As shown in the representative spectra (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), after incubation with \u03b2-glucuronidase, the peak of indomethacin glucuronide was diminished and that of indomethacin greatly increased. This change was detected in each of the samples studied (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). To evaluate enzyme activity, we compared the ratio of indomethacin-glucuronide to indomethacin in mice pretreated with or without the antibiotic cocktail. In urine, the ratio was significantly higher in antibiotic-treated mice for the first 12\u2009hr following indomethacin administration (93.3% higher at 4\u00a0hr, 55.6% higher at 8\u00a0hr, 43.4% at 12\u00a0hr; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In feces, indomethacin-glucuronide was barely detectable in control mice, yet was readily detected in antibiotic-treated mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Indomethacin suppressed urinary prostanoid metabolites irrespective of treatment with the antibiotic cocktail (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In control mice, indomethacin reduced these metabolites in a time-dependent fashion. A similar pattern was evident for PGD-M and PGI-M in antibiotic-treated mice. However, concentrations of the most abundant prostanoids, PGE-M and Tx-M, were suppressed to a lesser degree by indomethacin, and their concentration started to recover faster in antibiotic-treated mice compared to control mice. Evidently \u03b2-glucuronidase-catalyzed de-glucuronidation was impaired due to antibiotic-treatment, partially suppressing the inhibitory effect of indomethacin on COX enzymes. Thus, the intestinal microbiota influences the disposition and efficacy of indomethacin in the host, at least in part by regulating its de-glucuronidation and reabsorption from the intestine."

This shift has been previously reported in genetically obese mice (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ley et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</a>), obese children (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bervoets et al., 2013</a>), and obese adults (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ley et al., 2006</a>). A decrease of <i>S24-7</i>, a family of Bacteroidetes, such as induced here by indomethacin, has been observed in a mouse model of colorectal cancer (<a href=\"#bib48\">Liang et al., 2014</a>) and in mice with high fat diet-induced obesity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Evans et al., 2014</a>). <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, also increased following indomethacin administration, have been associated with lupus (<a href=\"#bib91\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>), drug-induced liver toxicity (<a href=\"#bib88\">Xu et al., 2015</a>) and the development of obesity and diabetes in genetically susceptible mice (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kameyama and Itoh, 2014</a>). While the importance of many of these observations remains to be established, they do suggest possible mechanisms of adverse health consequences."

Sequences were aligned using PyNAST (<a href=\"#bib11\">Caporaso et al., 2010a</a>) and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using FastTree (<a href=\"#bib65\">Price et al., 2009</a>). Weighted and unweighted UniFrac (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lozupone and Knight, 2005</a>) distances were calculated for each pair of samples for the\u00a0assessment of community similarity and generation of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots. Taxonomic composition and alpha diversity were generated for each sample. To compare bacterial abundances across sample groups, <i>group_significance.py</i> was used with default parameters.

Please justify the choice to use of such a traumatic dosage, rather than a dosage, more relevant to the use of the drug for therapeutic/symptom management purposes given the goal of the study to use mouse models to mechanistically unravel host-microbe-drug interaction in humans. Further, given the changes that occur in the microbiome over dietary, circadian cycles, etc, a longer timeframe would provide more relevant information as to the effects of indomethacin on the microbiota.

The data and interpretation are presented in the revised manuscript. Chronic treatment also induced the expansion of <i>Peptococcaceae</i> and <i>Erysipelotrichaceae</i> in the GI tract and <i>Ruminococcus</i> and <i>Anearoplasma</i> in the feces, consistent with previous results from the study of acute treatment. Evidently these genera responded to indomethacin both in the initial phase and in the longer term. We also observed that several acute treatment-induced changes were less significant in the long-term dosing study. It could be that these changes are involved in the initial response only, or that the temporal variation overrides the drug-induced changes. Additional possibilities include the differing magnitude of systemic drug exposure, the methods of drug delivery, and non-identical microbiota in mice at the start of the experiment. Further studies, outside the scope of this manuscript, will address these possibilities."

We think there could be multiple mechanisms by which xenobiotics cause compositional changes in gut microbiota, including those previously reported by others. One example would be the cross-feeding model. Certain commensal bacteria can directly consume xenobiotics and secrete metabolites into the environment, which may be used by other bacteria to boost their growth. Another example could be a host-dependent influence, where xenobiotics affect host characteristics (especially in the local environment of the intestine) and induce changes in immune regulation of gut bacteria. Chassaing and colleagues (Chassaing et al. 2015) reported that dietary emulsifiers, such as carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80, altered microbial localization as well as OTU abundances. However, they didn\u2019t establish the causal relationship between the localization and altered OTUs. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of xenobiotic-induced changes in bacteria."

Hence, the real biological changes due to the drug treatment are less likely to be masked by other variables. In contrast, in the colon content analysis, comparisons were made between different groups of mice so that inter-mouse variability and caging effect may mask the influences caused by drug treatment. The reviewer also pointed out the differences among mice before treatment. We were aware of inter-mouse variability, so we carefully randomized animals into three groups and randomly conducted treatment on different days.
