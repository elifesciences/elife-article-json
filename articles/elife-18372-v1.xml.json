We employed fluorescence imaging and GCaMP6 reporter mice to generate retinotopic maps, revealing additional regions of retinotopic organization that extend into barrel and retrosplenial cortices. Aligning retinotopic maps to architectonic borders, we found a mismatch in border location, indicating that architectonic borders are not aligned with the retinotopic transition at the vertical meridian. We also assessed the representation of visual space within each region, finding that four visual areas bordering V1 (LM, P, PM and RL) display complementary representations, with overlap primarily at the central hemifield. Our results extend our understanding of the organization of mouse cortex to include up to 16 distinct retinotopically organized regions."

We employed fluorescence imaging and GCaMP6 reporter mice to generate retinotopic maps, revealing additional regions of retinotopic organization that extend into barrel and retrosplenial cortices. Aligning retinotopic maps to architectonic borders, we found a mismatch in border location, indicating that architectonic borders are not aligned with the retinotopic transition at the vertical meridian. We also assessed the representation of visual space within each region, finding that four visual areas bordering V1 (LM, P, PM and RL) display complementary representations, with overlap primarily at the central hemifield. Our results extend our understanding of the organization of mouse cortex to include up to 16 distinct retinotopically organized regions."

For example, architectonic borders are drawn where there are abrupt changes in the density of cells, or the degree to which they are stained by certain chemicals. Maps based on architectonics and those based on brain activity are thought to exhibit matching borders between visual areas."

The ability to quickly generate maps that are comparable to those resulting from 1\u20132 hr of red-wavelength reflectance-based imaging under anesthesia (<a href=\"#bib9\">Garrett et al., 2014</a>) is a practical advantage of GCaMP6 fluorescence-based mapping. Typically, we further reduced the effects on ongoing activity by presenting 20\u201340 sweeps of the stimulus in each direction (imaging for 30\u201360 min). Like previous authors, we found that maps displayed consistent structure across mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The arrangement of areas was broadly consistent with published maps of the mouse visual system (e.g. <a href=\"#bib50\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Marshel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Garrett et al., 2014</a>), but differed in several respects. Key differences include additional visual field sign patches, particularly medial to AM and PM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The narrow strip of tissue between AM/PM and retrosplenial cortex is generally termed MM or V2MM and is considered part of visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Franklin and Paxinos, 2007</a>), but its retinotopic structure remains uncharacterized. GCaMP6 fluorescence-based maps revealed consistent structure in MM, with a positive field sign patch medial to AM (MMA) and a negative field sign patch medial to PM (MMP). Furthermore, there were one or more positive field sign patches medial to MMA and MMP, likely in retrosplenial cortex. The most consistent was a positive field sign region which our automated segmentation routine generally failed to separate from PM. Finally, in lateral visual cortex, we observed a negative field sign patch anterior and lateral to RL, which we termed RLL."

The additional signal was a neuropil trace tuned to 24.15 and 24.28 degrees in altitude and azimuth. To increase the effect of this additional contamination, we first multiplied the amplitude of the contaminating trace by 10. From the modified traces, we recalculated the somatic altitude and azimuth maps with and without neuropil subtraction. As expected, in the absence of neuropil subtraction, the added signal shifted all somatic tuning towards the coordinates of the added signal, whereas with neuropil subtraction enabled, the somatic altitude and azimuth maps were almost identical to the unmodified maps). Left column: somatic altitude and azimuth maps. Center column: somatic altitude and azimuth maps after addition of enlarged neuropil signal, with no neuropil subtraction. Right column: somatic altitude and azimuth maps after addition of enlarged neuropil trace, with neuropil subtraction.

Neuropil contamination, the presence of fluorescence from surrounding GCaMP-labeled processes in the somatic pixels, is a characteristic of densely labeled tissue. We extracted fluorescence from the neuropil surrounding each neuron and, as expected, found that these local regions of neuropil displayed receptive fields (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Many of the neuropil regions displayed similar retinotopy to their parent somata. To correct for neuropil contamination, for each soma we measured and subtracted neuropil fluorescence from the surrounding pixels. Numerical simulations indicated that this approach was effective in removing neuropil contamination from somatic fluorescence measurements and confirmed that the map of somatic retinotopy was not an artifact of neuropil contamination (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

However, the checkerboard pattern includes sharp borders between black and white regions of the checkerboard that naturally include a broad band of spatial and temporal frequencies. Furthermore, retinotopically-organized regions occupy most of the territory between primary sensory areas in posterior cortex, suggesting that there are few additional\u00a0visual areas to be discovered in the mouse.

Furthermore, imaging of widefield fluorescence signals at the brain surface is strongly contaminated by vasculature artifacts, which we address by focusing below the surface of cortex. Defocusing has a blurring effect and can limit effective resolution. Widefield fluorescence signals in Emx1 mice are presumably the average of fluorescence from many neurons, with dendrites and axons providing fluorescence signals far from the soma. Processes probably\u00a0cross regional borders, making it likely that dendritic and axonal signals from neurons on one side of the border contribute to fluorescence on the other side of the border. It is unclear the extent to which border-crossing processes blur borders since blurring will depend on many factors, including whether stimulus-locked changes in the fluorescence of processes more closely match stimulus-locked changes of the parent soma or of the local network into which the processes extend. Given the potential for blurring of borders, it is perhaps surprising that widefield and 2-photon images give border locations which are separated by only a few tens of micrometers."

Consistent with this suggestion, medial and lateral regions of visual cortex, likely corresponding to LM, RL and PM, display different response latencies in mice (<a href=\"#bib35\">Polack and Contreras, 2012</a>), and neurons in these areas differ in their mean receptive field sizes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>) and in their tuning to the spatial and temporal characteristics of visual stimuli (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andermann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Marshel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Roth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Glickfeld et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Tohmi et al., 2014</a>). These studies all support the identification of multiple visual areas in the tissue bordering V1, in contrast with primates where the tissue neighboring V1 is considered a single visual area (V2)."

V1 included a visual coverage range of\u00a0~60\u00b0 in altitude and\u00a0~90\u00b0 in azimuth, comparable to measurements with reflectance-based imaging (e.g. <a href=\"#bib9\">Garrett et al., 2014</a>) but smaller than the range measured with single-cell electrical recordings (~100\u00b0 in altitude and\u00a0~150\u00b0 in azimuth; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wagor et al.

The outer limits at which visual stimuli can evoke activity in V1 will be expanded, by approximately the radius of the largest receptive fields of neurons at the edges of V1. A more pronounced expansion in effective coverage is expected in higher visual areas, where receptive field sizes are larger (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>). Expanded coverage, calculated using published receptive field sizes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</a>) is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. For V1, expanded coverage includes\u00a0~70\u00b0 in altitude and\u00a0~100\u00b0 in azimuth. Mean local receptive field size may change across a visual area, which possibly\u00a0accounts for the mismatch of coverage at the borders of neighboring areas (e.g. the V1-LM border, where the outer limits of the estimated V1 and LM coverage differ)."

For example, in V1 most pyramidal neuron receptive fields are within\u00a0~7\u00a0degrees of the local population average (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bonin et al., 2011</a>). How variability relative to the mean local receptive field center changes towards the borders of V1 or in other visual areas is unknown, but an expansion of coverage of 7\u00a0degrees at each border (in addition to the expansion due to receptive field size) would result in total coverage of V1 of\u00a0~85\u00b0 in altitude and\u00a0~115\u00b0 in azimuth, closer to the numbers from single-cell recordings. These differences between population and single-cell coverages may explain the small apparent regions of coverage of many higher visual areas, in which receptive field sizes and perhaps also the scatter in receptive field centers are greater than in V1. Even allowing for some expansion of coverage for each visual area, our results indicate that no higher visual areas (even those immediately surrounding V1) contain a complete description of the visual hemifield. Hence information on features that subtend more than approximately a quarter of the visual field will be routed to different early visual areas, with the result that information on features in different locations within a single visual scene will be processed in regions with different functional properties. Further studies will be needed to understand the advantages and limitations of processing information from different locations in visual space in functionally distinct regions of visual cortex."

The central claim that functional and cytoarchitecural borders do not agree is exhilarating yet at the same time troubling. For that reason, both the reviewers and the Reviewing Editor (BRE) concur that this aspect of the work needs to be both better examined and more fully explained. The BRE has summarized this issue in terms of additional experiments and analysis that should provide clarity. You are not obligated to perform all or even any of these, but you do need to convince the reviewers and BRE that the extension of activation beyond cytological borders is real. Please consider:"

To echo the comments of reviewer 1, it is imperative to know if these extend past cytological boundaries as they do in other areas (e.g., motor nuclei, to bring up classical structures). Perhaps you can do a number of intracellular fills of somata near the calcium signal and see if these, as opposed to the dendrites, are within the cytological border. Or perhaps you can make maps based on the calcium response to more localized cells, like parvalbumen cells, for at least a few areas."

A comparison of calcium signaling as captured by wide-field imaging versus 3-D (z-stacks) with two-photo imaging near a few borders would be an excellent technical contribution to the field and settle many issues regarding this and other studies of this type."

As you note \"\u2026visual field sign at each pixel is the sine of the angle between the local gradients\u2026 in azimuth and altitude. To find borders, the visual field map was converted to a binary image using a manually-defined threshold (~0.3-0.5) and the initial visual patches were further processed with a split/merge routine (Garrett et al., 2014)\u2026\". We assume that the threshold is on the absolute value of the visual field sign, which ranges [-1,+1] before binarization. This critical step needs to be justified with a sensitivity analysis, i.e., would a shift in threshold change the extent of overlap."

We appreciate that the SE of the measured mean position is small, but the range of movement is large and this smearing could also appreciably extend the border. Perhaps an extend run should be made on one map and only trials with movement of say &lt; one degree is averaged. This would demonstrate if movement does or does not contribution to a systematic extension of the borders."

As paraphrased from reviewer 2's summary: \"\u2026the mismatch between field maps and cytoarchitectonic maps has not been convincingly demonstrated. This casts doubts on the most far-reaching conclusion that cytoarchitectonic borders cannot be considered as real borders. If true the much celebrated Brodmann 2.0 myeloarchitectonic area map of human cortex (Glasser et al., Nature 2016) should not be considered a map of functionally distinct areas. So, in the absence of conclusive evidence a more cautious conclusion would be that the registration of visual field maps to the underlying anatomy lacks sufficient spatial resolution to definitively settle the issue\u2026\". We note that the maps in Glaser are based on cytological boundaries, thickness of myelin (myeloarchitectonic), past knowledge of both function projections, and the results of resting state BOLD fMRI. The BRE was surprised that the resting state data in Glasser et al. gave such similar boundaries as those found from cytology, since resting state BOLD is based on parcelating voxels that have similar ultra-low-frequency fluctuations in the BOLD signal (e.g., Smith et al. TiCS 2013). Your method for parcellation is based directly on neuronal (albeit Ca and not spiking) and yields a different result than the resting state BOLD. Thus your conclusions, properly supported, could have profound impact on our thinking of maps derived from resting state BOLD signals versus more direct measures of neuronal activity."

The overlap with other sensory modalities is a new exciting finding. The techniques used here were particularly well implemented and an appropriate amount of controls have been used to validate these findings. Beyond the important descriptive aspect of this work and the high quality of the results, the conclusions open new insight about multimodal processing operating within cortex."

To validate the method, the authors should provide the consistency of retinotopic mapping within single animals between days so we can see whether these are truly relatively invariant maps or whether reflect the nuances of the statistical analysis. Is there any consistent relationship with the map borders and surface vessels, maybe an example could be shown?"

Some confusion arises since not vessels are visible in the fixed prep (arterioles only?). 2-photon cellular imaging may be another way of confirming that cellular retinotopically mapped signals are present in barrel cortex.

The results suggest a more complex parcellation scheme with 16 rather than 10 distinct areas. Three of the newly discovered visual areas reside in barrel cortex, encroach onto auditory cortex and take up space in retrosplenial cortex. The results further suggest that retinotopic and cytoarchitectonic borders are misaligned and are therefore ill-suited for delineating cortical areas. Each of the observations is eye-popping and challenges established concepts of cortical parcellation. Although field sign mapping is a powerful tool to provide a rough estimate of visual areas, I am concerned that the method overstates the spatial precision with which this can be achieved. The authors have made an impressive effort to align retinotopic maps with cytoarchitectonically defined areas, but despite the sweat have not crossed the threshold for disposing the long-held notion that cytoarchitectonic borders coincide with retinotopic borders. Three reasons may account for this. First, the eye movements account for up to 375 \u03bcm error along azimuth and ~300 \u03bcm along elevation, sufficient to account for the suggested misalignment of borders. Second, in the critical <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> it is difficult to match the blood vessels seen during retinotopic mapping with those seen after staining fixed sections for cytochrome oxidase. Further, it is not clear whether these procedures have been applied in all cases. None of the illustrated examples match the maps shown in A, making it difficult to accept the conclusion that borders are mismatched. Third, the patches identified in S1 and retrosplenial cortex map tiny regions of the visual field and resemble more projection fields than separate visual area. Visual projections to both of these regions are well documented. Thus, it appears premature to view RRL and retrosplenial cortex as new visual areas. In summary, the paper makes bold assertions, which if proven correct, have profound consequences."

As paraphrased from reviewer 2's summary: \"\u2026the mismatch between field maps and cytoarchitectonic maps has not been convincingly demonstrated. This casts doubts on the most far-reaching conclusion that cytoarchitectonic borders cannot be considered as real borders. If true the much celebrated Brodmann 2.0 myeloarchitectonic area map of human cortex (Glasser et al., Nature 2016) should not be considered a map of functionally distinct areas. So, in the absence of conclusive evidence a more cautious conclusion would be that the registration of visual field maps to the underlying anatomy lacks sufficient spatial resolution to definitively settle the issue\u2026\". We note that the maps in Glaser are based on cytological boundaries, thickness of myelin (myeloarchitectonic), past knowledge of both function projections, and the results of resting state BOLD fMRI. The BRE was surprised that the resting state data in Glasser et al. gave such similar boundaries as those found from cytology, since resting state BOLD is based on parcelating voxels that have similar ultra-low-frequency fluctuations in the BOLD signal (e.g., Smith et al. TiCS 2013). Your method for parcellation is based directly on neuronal (albeit Ca and not spiking) and yields a different result than the resting state BOLD. Thus your conclusions, properly supported, could have profound impact on our thinking of maps derived from resting state BOLD signals versus more direct measures of neuronal activity.</i>"

Architectonic borders do not necessarily match retinotopic borders, but may align with other functional borders. For example, it is possible that the retinotopic lateral border of V1 marks the lateral extent of retino-geniculate projections from the contralateral eye representing the contralateral visual field, and the architectonic border the lateral extent of retino-geniculate projections from the contralateral eye representing the ipsilateral visual field (Laing et al., 2015)."

The results suggest a more complex parcellation scheme with 16 rather than 10 distinct areas. Three of the newly discovered visual areas reside in barrel cortex, encroach onto auditory cortex and take up space in retrosplenial cortex. The results further suggest that retinotopic and cytoarchitectonic borders are misaligned and are therefore ill-suited for delineating cortical areas. Each of the observations is eye-popping and challenges established concepts of cortical parcellation. Although field sign mapping is a powerful tool to provide a rough estimate of visual areas, I am concerned that the method overstates the spatial precision with which this can be achieved. The authors have made an impressive effort to align retinotopic maps with cytoarchitectonically defined areas, but despite the sweat have not crossed the threshold for disposing the long-held notion that cytoarchitectonic borders coincide with retinotopic borders. Three reasons may account for this. First, the eye movements account for up to 375 \u03bcm error along azimuth and ~300 \u03bcm along elevation, sufficient to account for the suggested misalignment of borders.</i>"

Functional evidence for retinotopic organization posterior to V1 is more sparse, but Garrett et al. (2014) includes reflectance images in which there appears to be retinotopic organization posterior to V1 (Garrett et al., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We can only speculate on why these posterior regions have not mapped more consistently in the past, but the additional challenges of imaging in this posterior location (the posterior sinus, the folded structure of posterior cortex and, in our experiments, the edge of the cranial window) may reduce the signal-to-noise ratio, relative to other parts of visual cortex, leading to less consistent results. In our maps, there is consistent retinotopic structure posterior to V1, with a field sign-positive strip extending across the posterior extent of V1 in almost every mouse (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Possibly the high signal-to-noise ratio of GCaMP6 imaging (compared to the SNR of reflectance-based imaging employed by many previous authors) may be sufficient to resolve consistent structure posterior to V1."
