The factors involved in, and the mechanistic basis of, CIMP is not understood. Among the CIMP genes are the tumor suppressors <i>p14</i><sup><i>ARF</i></sup>, <i>p15</i><sup><i>INK4B</i></sup>, and <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK4A</i></sup>, encoded by the <i>INK4-ARF</i> locus. In this study, we perform an RNA interference screen and identify ZNF304, a zinc-finger DNA-binding protein, as the pivotal factor required for <i>INK4-ARF</i> silencing and CIMP in CRCs containing activated KRAS. In KRAS-positive human CRC cell lines and tumors, ZNF304 is bound at the promoters of <i>INK4-ARF</i> and other CIMP genes. Promoter-bound ZNF304 recruits a corepressor complex that includes the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, resulting in DNA hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. KRAS promotes silencing through upregulation of ZNF304, which drives DNA binding. Finally, we show that ZNF304 also directs transcriptional silencing of <i>INK4-ARF</i> in human embryonic stem cells."

The factors involved in, and the mechanistic basis of, CIMP is not understood. Among the CIMP genes are the tumor suppressors <i>p14</i><sup><i>ARF</i></sup>, <i>p15</i><sup><i>INK4B</i></sup>, and <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK4A</i></sup>, encoded by the <i>INK4-ARF</i> locus. In this study, we perform an RNA interference screen and identify ZNF304, a zinc-finger DNA-binding protein, as the pivotal factor required for <i>INK4-ARF</i> silencing and CIMP in CRCs containing activated KRAS. In KRAS-positive human CRC cell lines and tumors, ZNF304 is bound at the promoters of <i>INK4-ARF</i> and other CIMP genes. Promoter-bound ZNF304 recruits a corepressor complex that includes the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, resulting in DNA hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. KRAS promotes silencing through upregulation of ZNF304, which drives DNA binding. Finally, we show that ZNF304 also directs transcriptional silencing of <i>INK4-ARF</i> in human embryonic stem cells."

A subset of CRCs have a so-called CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) characterized by aberrant DNA hypermethylation of many genes. In fact, CRCs can be categorized into three distinct subclasses based on their epigenetic and genetic profiles: CIMP-1 (also called CIMP-high), characterized by intense methylation of multiple genes, microsatellite instability and BRAF mutations; CIMP-2 (also called CIMP-low), typified by methylation of a more limited group of genes and mutation in KRAS; and CIMP-negative, distinguished by infrequent methylation and p53 mutation (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yagi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kaneda and Yagi, 2011</a>). Specific panels of CIMP marker genes have been developed to classify CRCs into these three subclasses. These CIMP marker genes have potential clinical value, and are currently being evaluated as biomarkers for risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of therapeutic responsiveness (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib8\">Egger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gyparaki et al., 2013</a>)."

Inactivation of the <i>INK4-ARF</i> locus is one of the most frequent events in cancers (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib29\">Kim and Sharpless, 2006</a>). For example, <i>INK4-ARF</i> is transcriptionally silenced in 30\u201345% of all CRCs and in 70% of CRCs that harbor an activating KRAS mutation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burri et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dominguez et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lind et al., 2004</a>)."

This process is reversed when somatic cells are induced to regain pluripotency through reprogramming. Expression of <i>INK4-ARF</i> limits stem cell self-renewal, suggesting that coordinated <i>INK4-ARF</i> expression may normally act to restrict stem cell numbers.

Similarly, treatment with manumycin A, a RAS farnesyltransferase inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hara et al., 1993</a>), also resulted in derepression of <i>p14</i><sup><i>ARF</i></sup>, <i>p15</i><sup><i>INK4B</i></sup><i>,</i> and <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK4A</i></sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and reduced binding of ZNF304 and its corepressors to the three promoters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Notably, shRNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of KRAS markedly reduced ZNF304 protein levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Likewise, addition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vlahos et al., 1994</a>) or PI-103, which blocks the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway downstream of activated KRAS (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hayakawa et al., 2006</a>), also derepressed p14<sup>ARF</sup>, p15<sup>INK4B</sup><i>,</i> and p16<sup>INK4A</sup> and reduced ZNF304 levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). By contrast, following shRNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of KRAS, <i>ZNF304</i> mRNA levels were not significantly affected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Thus, upregulation of ZNF304 by activated KRAS is predominantly post-transcriptional. Consistent with this idea, the reduction of ZNF304 protein levels following KRAS inhibition could be counteracted by proteasome inhibition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>)."

Notably, these CIMP marker genes include <i>p14</i><sup><i>ARF</i></sup> and <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK4A</i></sup>, as well as other TSGs, which prompted us to ask whether ZNF304 and its corepressors have a general role in the aberrant hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing characteristic of CIMP-positive CRCs containing activated KRAS. To address this possibility, we knocked down KRAS or ZNF304 in DLD-1 cells and analyzed CIMP marker gene expression by qRT-PCR. Remarkably, knockdown of either KRAS or ZNF304 derepressed expression of all 50 CIMP marker genes analyzed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Interestingly, knockdown of either KRAS or ZNF304 also derepressed <i>VIM</i> and <i>SEPT9</i> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), whose DNA hypermethylation is used to diagnose CRC (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gyparaki et al., 2013</a>). Bisulfite sequencing analysis of a representative subset of CIMP marker genes, which included <i>p14</i><sup><i>ARF</i></sup>, <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK4A</i></sup> and seven additional genes, revealed that shRNA-mediated knockdown of KRAS or ZNF304 also decreased promoter hypermethylation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). ChIP analysis showed significant enrichment of ZNF304, KAP1, SETDB1, and DNMT1 on the promoters of the nine CIMP marker genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D and 6B</a>), whose expression was also derepressed by the knockdown of the ZNF304 corepressors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C and 6C</a>)."

We therefore analyzed a possible role for ZNF304 and its corepressors in H9 cells, a well-characterized hESC line. The immunoblot results of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> show that in undifferentiated H9 hESCs, ZNF304 was present at high levels, which markedly decreased following differentiation by retinoic acid treatment. Moreover, in undifferentiated H9 hESCs ZNF304, KAP1, SETDB1, and DNMT1 were substantially enriched at the <i>p14</i><sup><i>ARF</i></sup>, <i>p15</i><sup><i>INK4B</i></sup><i>,</i> and <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK4A</i></sup> promoters (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), which was largely lost following differentiation. Finally, knockdown of ZNF304 in undifferentiated H9 hESCs (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) resulted in decreased association of KAP1, SETDB1, and DNMT1 with the <i>p14</i><sup><i>ARF</i></sup>, <i>p15</i><sup><i>INK4B</i></sup><i>,</i> and <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK4A</i></sup> promoters (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) and increased expression of <i>p14</i><sup><i>ARF</i></sup>, <i>p15</i><sup><i>INK4B</i></sup><i>,</i> and <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK4A</i></sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>).

However, the mechanistic basis of epigenetic silencing is not understood. According to one model, an epigenetic event, such as hypermethylation of a CpG-rich promoter region of a TSG, occurs randomly due, for example, to loss of fidelity or mutation of an epigenetic enzyme. The hypermethylation results in silencing of the TSG, which confers a selectable growth advantage (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib17\">Hassler and Egger, 2012</a>). In a second model, transcriptional silencing occurs through a specific pathway, comprising a defined set of components, initiated by an oncoprotein."

The pathway is initiated on DNA by binding of the transcriptional repressor, ZNF304, which recruits a corepressor complex that includes SETDB1, KAP1 and DNMT1, leading to promoter hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. Activated KRAS regulates the pathway by maintaining high levels of ZNF304, which drives DNA binding. The basis by which activated KRAS increases ZNF304 levels is transcriptional upregulation of PRKD1, a serine/threonine kinase, and USP28, a deubiquitinase, two of the factors that were isolated in our primary RNAi screen. We further showed that PRKD1 phosphorylates USP28, which interacts with and stabilizes ZNF304 from proteolytic degradation."

In a previous study, we have found that silencing of the <i>Fas</i> tumor suppressor in RAS-transformed NIH 3T3 cells requires ZFP354B (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gazin et al., 2007</a>), which like ZNF304 is a KRAB-ZFP protein.

In fact, in ESCs H3K27me3 is a more predominant silencing mechanism than DNA hypermethylation, which is believed to be because H3K27me3 is more readily reversible. Several studies have identified subgroups of genes in which the H3K27me3 present in ESCs is replaced by abnormal DNA hypermethylation in cancer cells. This phenomenon, which has been referred to as \u2018epigenetic switching\u2019, results in the permanent silencing of key regulatory genes that may contribute to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib49\">Sharma et al., 2010</a>)."

One model to explain the two repression patterns is differential recruitment of corepressors, such as PRCs or DNMTs, in non-malignant and cancer cells. However, we found that in hESCs and KRAS-positive CRC cells the same set of corepressors are recruited to <i>INK4-ARF</i>. Moreover, corepressor recruitment is dependent upon the same sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, ZNF304. Our results suggest a model involving differential enzymatic activity of a common, promoter-bound corepressor complex resulting in predominantly DNA hypermethylation, in KRAS-positive CRC cells, or predominantly H3K27me3, in hESCs."

To ensure activity of the purified wild-type protein, a 20-\u00b5l reaction was set up as follows: 1 \u00b5l <sup>32</sup>P-\u03b3-ATP (10 mCi), 1 \u00b5l 10 \u00b5M ATP, 0.2 mM microcystin, 4 \u00b5l 5X kinase buffer (23 mM MOPS, 11.5 mM \u03b2-glycerphosphate, 23 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4.6 mM EGTA, 1.8 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM DTT [pH 7.0]), and 60 nM purifiedHis-PRKD1 diluted in 1X kinase buffer. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30\u00b0C and stopped using 2X Laemmli Sample Buffer. Autophosphorylation of the wild-type protein was confirmed by immunoblotting with a PRKD1-Ser916 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). To monitor phosphorylation of USP28, the above reaction was carried out using 10 \u00b5M substrate (peptides corresponding to amino acids 543\u2013557 [TCLQRWRSEIEQDIQ] or 892\u2013906 [YSLFRKVSVYLLTGL] in USP28) diluted in 1X kinase buffer. Incorporation of the radiolabel into the peptide was monitored by autoradiography."

The authors describe a detailed pathway in which activated KRAS ultimately leads to DNA methylation of the INK4-ARF and a number of other CIMP loci. The pathway was elucidated through a genome-wide RNAi screen and a large number of standard molecular biological experiments. It involves a DNA-binding transcription factor and its associated co\u2013repressor complex, a DNA methylase, a deubiquitinase, a protein kinase, and the AP-1 factor June Moreover, the authors provide clear evidence that this pathway is relevant in human cancer by analyzing patient samples. Lastly, they also show that aspects of this pathway also occur in embryonic stem cells, providing a new link between such stem cells and the cancer state. Although the Green laboratory published a seminal paper showing that DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes can arise from a detailed genetic pathway as opposed to previous belief that methylation occurs randomly (and then propagated), this paper uses a completely different system. As such, it is important for its own sake as well as providing a new example of the general principle, which I think is largely under-appreciated in the haze of cancer and chromatin work. The paper is extremely well written, and I have no specific comments other than to cite the work of Sonia Kohai."
