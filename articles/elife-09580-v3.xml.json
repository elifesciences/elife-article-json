The functions of the different assembly stages in exocytosis and the role of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly are not well understood. Using optical tweezers, we observed four distinct stages of assembly in SNARE N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains (or NTD, MD, CTD, and LD, respectively). We found that SNARE layer mutations differentially affect SNARE assembly. Comparison of their effects on SNARE assembly and on exocytosis reveals that NTD and CTD are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, whereas MD regulates SNARE assembly and fusion. Munc18-1 initiates SNARE assembly and structures t-SNARE C-terminus independent of syntaxin N-terminal regulatory domain (NRD) and stabilizes the half-zippered SNARE complex dependent upon the NRD. Our observations demonstrate distinct functions of SNARE domains whose assembly is intimately chaperoned by Munc18-1."

The functions of the different assembly stages in exocytosis and the role of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly are not well understood. Using optical tweezers, we observed four distinct stages of assembly in SNARE N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains (or NTD, MD, CTD, and LD, respectively). We found that SNARE layer mutations differentially affect SNARE assembly. Comparison of their effects on SNARE assembly and on exocytosis reveals that NTD and CTD are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, whereas MD regulates SNARE assembly and fusion. Munc18-1 initiates SNARE assembly and structures t-SNARE C-terminus independent of syntaxin N-terminal regulatory domain (NRD) and stabilizes the half-zippered SNARE complex dependent upon the NRD. Our observations demonstrate distinct functions of SNARE domains whose assembly is intimately chaperoned by Munc18-1."

This complex docks the vesicle to the target and then acts like a \u201czipper\u201d to pull the two membranes close enough to fuse. The best-studied SNARE proteins act in nerve cells and fuse vesicles to the cell\u2019s membrane in order to release molecules called neurotransmitters. This process is essential for communication between nerve cells, and relies on a protein called Munc18-1. However, it is not well understood how SNARE proteins assemble into the complex and how Munc18-1 regulates this process."

SNARE proteins are made up of four parts called domains, and Ma et al. observed that the N-terminal domains were the first to bind to each other. Next, the binding progressed to the middle domain, then to the C-terminal domain and finally to the linker domain. An intermediate, half-zippered form was also observed."

Further experiments showed that Munc18-1 promoted the assembly of new SNARE complexes and stabilized the half-zippered form, rather than stabilizing the complex after it had fully assembled. This study will provide a new tool to examine many other proteins that regulate SNARE assembly, and a basis to understand the role of SNARE proteins in brain activity."

The fusion requires the vesicle-anchored v-SNARE VAMP2 (also called synaptobrevin), the plasma-membrane-associated t-SNAREs syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), and the SM-protein Munc18-1 (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sollner et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Verhage et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Sudhof, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rothman, 2014</a>). Extensive evidence suggests that the t- and v-SNAREs first form a partial trans-SNARE complex bridging the two membranes with the assistance of many regulatory proteins, including Munc18-1, synaptotagmin, complexin, and Munc13, which docks the vesicle to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib79\">Xu et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Melia et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Sudhof, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rothman, 2014</a>). Upon the arrival of an action potential and resultant Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, the trans-SNARE complex rapidly zippers to complete its assembly and membrane fusion. However, an alternative model suggests that SNARE assembly only starts after Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggering and completes in one step without any intermediates (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</a>). The fully assembled SNARE complex forms a stable parallel four-helix bundle (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sutton et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Stein et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The tight SNARE association is mediated by 15 layers of hydrophobic amino acids and a central ionic layer in the core of the bundle (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fasshauer et al., 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Numerous studies have shown that layer mutations differentially impact synaptic exocytosis, brain functions, and human psychology (<a href=\"#bib74\">Walter et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mohrmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Sudhof, 2014</a>). Thus, it is crucial to understand how SNARE assembly dictates stage-wise exocytosis and how SNARE mutations alter the energetics and kinetics of SNARE assembly to cause their observed phenotypes."

On one hand, Munc18-1 can significantly enhance the rate and specificity of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion under certain conditions (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rathore et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yu et al., 2015</a>). On the other hand, Munc18-1 tightly associates with syntaxin in a closed conformation that inhibits SNARE assembly (<a href=\"#bib11\">Colbert et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Burkhardt et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dulubova et al., 1999</a>).

Such a thermodynamic coupling mechanism predicts that any perturbation in SNARE assembly impacts membrane fusion. Significant progresses have been made to test the prediction in the past two decades (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Walter et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mohrmann et al., 2010</a>). However, a quantitative test requires accurate and comprehensive measurements of both the energies and kinetics of SNARE assembly and the rates of membrane fusion for wild-type and various mutant SNARE complexes. Whereas SNARE-mediated membrane fusion has been widely examined in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, the energetics and kinetics of SNARE assembly have not been well characterized using traditional experimental approaches (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fasshauer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Wiederhold and Fasshauer, 2009</a>). Consequently, a quantitative Munc18-1-dependent model linking the thermodynamics of SNARE assembly to membrane fusion is lacking. For example, although VAMP2 layer mutation F77A abolished exocytosis, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements showed that the mutation barely changed SNARE folding energy (<a href=\"#bib74\">Walter et al., 2010</a>). To address this challenge, we have recently established a single-molecule assay for SNARE assembly based on high-resolution optical tweezers and characterized the folding intermediates, energies, and kinetics of four representative SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Zorman et al., 2014</a>). We have found that all the SNARE complexes are similarly unzipped in two reversible steps and one irreversible step, corresponding to sequential disassembly of SNARE LD, CTD, and NTD at increasing forces. However, complete stage-wise <i>assembly</i> has not directly been observed, due to the slow NTD association. Here, we developed a new SNARE construct that allowed us to measure reversible SNARE assembly and disassembly in four distinct stages and to determine their folding energies and kinetics (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We found that these different assembly stages are regulated by Munc18-1 and play distinct roles in membrane fusion."

The NRD contains a ~15 amino acid (a.a.) N-terminal peptide (N-peptide) and a C-terminal H<sub>abc</sub> domain in a three-helix bundle conformation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fernandez et al., 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To observe reversible and regulatory SNARE assembly, we designed SNARE complexes containing the full cytoplasmic domain and an N-terminal crosslinking site between syntaxin and VAMP2. We examined six such SNARE constructs crosslinked at different sites (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig1s2\">2</a>) and found that the construct crosslinked near the -6 hydrophobic layer exhibited fast and reversible NTD folding/unfolding transition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B,C</a>). Compared to the slow and irreversible NTD association detected for the SNARE constructs crosslinked N-terminal to the -7 layer (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s2\">2</a>, construct I), the fast NTD folding observed here implicated the existence of a nucleation site for NTD zippering near or N-terminal to the -6 layer. This new construct was used for most of the experiments described below. To manipulate a single SNARE complex, we either pulled or relaxed the complex by moving one optical trap relative to the other at a speed of 10 nm/s or held the complex under constant average force at a fixed trap separation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Both force and extension of the protein-DNA tether were recorded at 10 kHz and used to derive the conformational and energetic changes of the SNARE complex in real time (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2012</a>). Specifically, for a reversible two-state transition, the folding energy of the associated protein domain can be measured based on the mechanical work required to unfold the domain, which is equal to the equilibrium force multiplied by the extension change related to the transition (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bustamante et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liphardt et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gao et al., 2011</a>)."

These discrete transitions were separated by continuous regions caused by elastic response of the SNARE-DNA tether to force change, while the SNARE complex remained in the same folding state. Accordingly, these FEC regions could be fit by a worm-like chain model for both the DNA handle and the unfolded polypeptide (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bustamante et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Marko and Siggia, 1995</a>). The fitting of these regions yielded different contour lengths for the polypeptide unfolded in the SNARE complex, which were used to derive the structures of SNARE assembly intermediates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The FECs associated with states 1\u20133 were identical to the FECs previously reported (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2012</a>) and independent of the N-terminal crosslinking (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>,<a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a>). The comparison suggests that the states 1, 2, and 3 are the fully folded, the LD-unfolded, and the partially-zippered SNARE complexes, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). A new reversible NTD transition partly overlapped the CTD transition (between states 3 and 5, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, inset). Relaxing the complex from state 5 led to a FEC that overlaps the FEC in the pulling phase, indicating complete and reversible reassembly of the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). However, pulling the complex in state 5 to higher forces saw a small rip resulting from unfolding of the remaining t-SNARE complex (from state 5 to state 6) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). No additional unfolding event was observed when further pulling the complex in state 6 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, #3), indicating that the SNARE complex was fully disassembled. We then relaxed the molecule to a force of 1 pN to check if SNARE reassembled. Unexpectedly, no single SNARE re-assembly event was detected among 45 different SNARE complexes tested. Consistent with our previous observation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2012</a>), the failure of reassembly was caused by dissociation of the SNAP-25 molecule upon t-SNARE unfolding, because adding 15 \u00b5M SNAP-25 into the solution rescued the assembly (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

This state had a maximum lifetime of ~1 ms and rapidly transited between state 3 and state 5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>A and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This transition was clearly seen in some FECs and extension traces plotted at \u22651 kHz bandwidth (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and was also found in our previous measurements (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Based on the measured extension changes accompanying the state transitions and the well-defined structures of the initial and final states of SNARE assembly (states 1 and 6), we derived the intermediate conformations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <b>'</b>Materials and methods<b>'</b>). In the partially-zippered state 3, the VAMP2 CTD and the t-SNARE CTD are unfolded from layer +8 to layer +3 and layer +5, respectively, whereas the remainder of the SNAREs are largely helical as in the four-helix bundle. This structure is consistent with that of a different trans-SNARE complex located on the yeast vacuole (<a href=\"#bib59\">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</a>). In the MD-unfolded state 4, VAMP2 is unfolded further to the ionic layer. Therefore, the MD consists of the ionic layer (0 layer) and the +1 and +2 layers exclusively comprising leucine and isoleucine residues known to form strong coiled coils (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which leads to the higher mechanical stability of the MD than the CTD and their distinct transitions. In the unzipped SNARE state 5, the t-SNARE complex remains in a three-helix bundle conformation, but with a frayed C-terminus (Tc). These conformations were further corroborated by results of protein binding and SNARE mutations described below."

We modeled SNARE zippering as VAMP2 folding along a t-SNARE template based on the crystal structure of the SNARE complex. The model included the extension and energy contributions of both the folded and unfolded portions of the complex along the pulling direction. In addition, we calculated the populations of different folding states and their transition rates based on the model. Simultaneous nonlinear least-squares fitting of the calculations to the corresponding measurements yielded the conformations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and energies of the three intermediate states and their associated transition states at zero force, resulting in the simplified energy landscape of SNARE folding/assembly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Specifically, the folding energies of NTD, MD, and CTD are 25 (\u00b12, S.D.) k<sub>B</sub>T, 13 (\u00b11) k<sub>B</sub>T, and 22 (\u00b13) k<sub>B</sub>T, respectively, where k<sub>B</sub> is the Boltzmann constant and T= 296 K the room temperature, with k<sub>B</sub>T=0.59 kcal/mol. Thus, the SNARE complex has total zippering energy of 68 (\u00b14) k<sub>B</sub>T, including 8 (\u00b12) k<sub>B</sub>T LD folding energy (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2012</a>). Folding of the NTD and CTD is downhill. In contrast, the MD has a folding energy barrier of 5.0 (\u00b10.6) k<sub>B</sub>T located close to the ionic layer, indicating a high-energy penalty to dehydrate the ionic layer for MD assembly (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rebane, et al., 2016</a>)."

To confirm the disordered Tc, we repeated the above experiments by adding a peptide comprising the C-terminal sequence 49\u201396 or layers from \u22122 to +8 of VAMP2 (Vc peptide) to the solution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We predicted that binding of the Vc peptide to the t-SNARE complex would induce a coil-to-helix transition in Tc and inhibit or attenuate SNARE zippering into the two partially-zippered states 3 and 4. The Vc peptide is widely used to facilitate studies of SNARE-mediated fusion (<a href=\"#bib40\">Melia et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pobbati et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hernandez et al., 2012</a>). Pre-bound to the t-SNARE complex, this peptide greatly enhances membrane fusion, probably because the Vc peptide stabilizes the t-SNARE complex in a conformation ready to pair with VAMP2, and thus helping to initiate SNARE zippering (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pobbati et al., 2006</a>). In the presence of 44 \u03bcM Vc peptide in the solution, we found that the Vc peptide frequently bound to the SNARE complex. The binding was manifested by a sudden SNARE transition into new Vc-bound states (cyan region in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Correspondingly, the binding caused a dramatic change in the histogram distribution of the extension (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Once bound, the Vc peptide did not dissociate from the SNARE complex, indicating that the Vc peptide outcompeted the VAMP2 molecule to tightly associate with the t-SNARE complex under our experimental conditions. The lifetime of the Vc-bound states was estimated to be greater than 10 min in the force range of NTD and CTD transitions. The Vc-bound SNARE states have a unimodal extension distribution (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), whose peak extension is 2.7 nm less than the average extension of the NTD-unfolded state 5, with an average shortening of 2.3 (\u00b10.5, N=8) nm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The extension shortening upon Vc binding is consistent with the predicted coil-to-helix transition in Tc, confirming the disordered Tc. The comparison of the extension distributions also reveals that the Vc peptide predominantly stabilized the SNARE complex in the Vn-unfolded state (state 8) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Partially\u00a0zippered states were only transient, indicated by downward extension excursions to a new state (state 7) with its extension greater than those of the partially zippered states 3 and 4. Thus, upon binding to the t-SNARE complex, the Vc peptide acted as a roadblock to attenuate VAMP2 from zippering. However, the Vc peptide was displaced by the VAMP2 molecule at an average force of 6 (\u00b1 1) pN upon relaxation. Taken together, these observations supported the conformations of the partially\u00a0zippered states and the unzipped state derived by us (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and indicated that the Vc peptide strongly attenuated SNARE zippering."

Most of these mutations are alanine substitutions in VAMP2 (<a href=\"#bib74\">Walter et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Furthermore, most of the mutants have been characterized in\u00a0vivo for their impacts in exocytosis and neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib74\">Walter et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mohrmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lagow et al., 2007</a>).

In contrast, M46A reduced the stability of NTD, as is indicated by a small decrease in the force for NTD transition compared to the wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). The approximately equal mechanical stabilities of MD and NTD now led to disappearance of the intermediate state 4 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

In addition, R56A increased the extension change associated with the MD transition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), corroborating the independent MD transition and the N-terminal border position of R56 in the MD. In contrast, L60A (+1) and L63A (+2) abolished the independent MD transition and caused MD to merge with CTD (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Consequently, the combined CTD and MD (CTD_MD) transited cooperatively as a distinct domain with an average extension change approximately equal to the sum (~11 nm) of the extension changes for the CTD (6\u20137 nm) and the MD (3\u20134 nm). Therefore, mutations at +1 and +2 layers altered the pathway of SNARE assembly, in which the distinct MD assembly was bypassed. Accordingly, all MD mutations abolished the energy barrier in MD folding (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rebane, et al., 2016</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Finally, we found that all MD mutants frequently and abruptly switched their transition kinetics (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), indicating an important role of MD in accurate and robust SNARE assembly. Because of the abundant heterogeneity, the folding energies of the MD mutants were only measured from the canonical regions. In summary, the middle domain plays a pivotal role in robust and correct stage-wise SNARE assembly, and its mutation leads to changes in SNARE assembly pathway and accuracy."

In contrast, L70A (+4) and F77A (+6) in VAMP2 and M71A/I192A (+5) in SNAP-25 greatly reduced the force ranges of the CTD transition that now overlapped the LD transition. In particular, the +6 layer mutation weakened both CTD and LD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>,<a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>,<a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Correspondingly, alanine substitutions at +4, +5 and +6 layers dramatically decreased CTD folding energies by 10 k<sub>B</sub>T, 13 k<sub>B</sub>T, and 12 k<sub>B</sub>T, respectively, compared to the wild-type. Our energy measurement of F77A contrasts with the previous measurement by ITC and is consistent with its ablation of exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib74\">Walter et al., 2010</a>). The syntaxin mutation T251I (+7) is unusual, because it increased the CTD zippering energy by 5 k<sub>B</sub>T (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>), quantitatively confirming the previous inference based on structural modeling (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lagow et al., 2007</a>).

We observed three force-dependent activities of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly, consistent with the previously reported multiple modes of binding between Munc18-1 and the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sudhof and Rothman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Sudhof, 2014</a>)."

To observe this activity, we completely unfolded the SNARE complex and then relaxed the complex to a low force to detect its possible reassembly (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). In the absence of Munc18-1, no SNARE reassembly was observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig9\">9B</a>) due to dissociation of the SNAP-25 molecule (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). In contrast, in the presence of 10 \u00b5M Munc18-1, 45% of 113 completely unfolded SNARE complexes showed full reassembly (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>). This observation suggests that Munc18-1 held the SNAP-25 molecule together with the tethered syntaxin or VAMP2 as t-SNARE unfolded, facilitating de\u00a0novo SNARE assembly. The SNARE assembly occurred in a force range of 1-16 pN, with an average force of 8.5 pN (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). In addition, the assembly events tended to appear in consecutive rounds of pulling and relaxing the same SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, #3-#5). Although the probability to observe a SNARE reassembly event was 0.45 under our experimental conditions, the probability to detect a SNARE reassembly event after another was 0.8, suggesting a strong correlation between the different reassembly events mediated by Munc18-1. An appealing interpretation for the correlation is that the same Munc18-1 molecule mediated the consecutive reassembly events without dissociation from the SNARE complex during its multiple rounds of disassembly and reassembly. The Munc18-1-mediated SNARE assembly was not abolished by the two VAMP2 layer mutations L60A and L63A (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). This finding suggests that, despite their effect on the accuracy of intrinsic SNARE assembly, neither MD mutation significantly affect Munc18-1-dependent de\u00a0novo SNARE assembly. Finally, we found that Munc18-1 similarly promoted SNARE assembly (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>) when the SNARE complex was crosslinked at a site N-terminal to the SNARE bundle (Construct I in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that the Munc18-1 activity was not caused by specific SNARE crosslinking. Interestingly, in this case, SNARE assembly occurred in two steps: t-SNARE formation at 12-17 pN, followed by cooperative SNARE zippering at 5-10 pN. Thus, Munc18-1 may mediate de\u00a0novo SNARE assembly via a t-SNARE intermediate."

Specifically, Munc18-1 is recruited by the N-peptide in the NRD to bind trans-SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shen et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, once Munc18-1 associates with trans-SNARE complexes, the NRD becomes dispensable for subsequent membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rathore et al., 2010</a>). These findings suggest that Munc18-1 binds SNARE complexes in both NRD-dependent and NRD-independent modes and can dynamically transit between the two binding modes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hu et al., 2011</a>). To pinpoint the possible role of the NRD in the Munc18-1-dependent SNARE zippering observed by us, we removed the NRD in the SNARE construct (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and repeated the above experiments. The NRD removal did not cause significant changes in the intrinsic stage-wise SNARE assembly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>,<a href=\"#fig2\">2A</a>, -NRD), which suggests that the NRD barely interacted with the SNARE motifs. Furthermore, the NRD removal did not alter the de\u00a0novo SNARE assembly (marked by red arrows in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>, #1, and <a href=\"#fig9\">9B</a>), indicating that the NRD is dispensable for this Munc18-1-dependent activity. However, Munc18-1 no longer stabilized the half-zippered state well (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11-figure supplement 1</a>). Instead, Munc18-1 mainly stabilized a novel state (state 11) with a distinct extension that was 1\u20133.5 nm less than the NTD-unfolded state 5 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11D</a> and <a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11-figure supplement 1</a>). The average extension difference between state 11 and state 5 is 2.5 (\u00b10.7, N=16) nm, approximately equal to the extension shortening caused by binding of the Vc peptide (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This Munc18-1 activity occurred at a rate of 0.015 s<sup>-1</sup> measured from a total experimental time of 4018 s. Surprisingly, Munc18-1 now bound much more strongly to the SNARE complex. More than half the Munc18-1-bound states lasted more than 30 s. Therefore, the NRD removal significantly enhances the thermodynamic stability of Munc18-1 binding to the SNARE complex."

State 10 had an average extension close to the half-zippered state 9, but with higher stability than state 9. When relaxing the Munc18-1-bound SNARE complex to a lower force, we saw an equilibrium shift from state 11 to state 10, reaching equilibrium at an average force of 14.0 (\u00b11.2) pN with corresponding extension change of 5.7 (\u00b10.6) nm (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>, #2, region marked by red rectangle). Munc18-1 was displaced from the SNARE complex in state 10 in a force range of 8-13 pN (indicated by the green arrow), with an average force of 10.3 pN. The displacement was accompanied by full SNARE assembly, which was confirmed by the FEC of the subsequent pulling phase. Thus, Munc18-1 attenuated SNARE NTD zippering in the absence of the NRD, although Munc18-1 stabilized the NTD in state 9 in the presence of the NRD. Because state 10 could resist SNARE zippering at a lower external force than state 9, state 10 must have higher mechanical stability than state 9.

We saw a small extension jump in a force range of 22-28 pN, showing that the Munc18-bound state 11 unfolded into the NTD-unfolded state 5 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>, indicated by magenta arrows). We inferred that state 11 has a conformation similar to the NTD-unfolded state 5, except that Munc18-1 is associated with a structured Tc in a way similar to the Vc peptide (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11E</a>). Indeed, upon SNARE binding Munc18-1 induced approximately equal extension shortening (2.5 \u00b1 0.7 nm) from state 5 as the Vc peptide (2.3 \u00b1 0.5 nm) did. Therefore, in the absence of NRD, Munc18-1 tightly bound t-SNARE and structured Tc. Because SNARE zippering was attenuated, Munc18-1 must also bind amino acids in t-SNARE N-terminal to \u22121 layer to interfere with NTD zippering (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11E</a>). Accordingly, we estimated that in state 10 VAMP2 was zippered to a position between \u22122 and \u22121 layers, in contrast with the half-zippered state 9 (between 0 and +1 layers). These observations suggest that Munc18-1 and the Vc peptide probably promote membrane fusion by the same mechanism: They structure Tc, stabilize the t-SNARE complex, and inhibit SNARE mis-assembly (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pobbati et al., 2006</a>), which outcompete their adverse effects of attenuating SNARE zippering. Finally, we found that Munc18-1 occasionally (4 out of 113) bypassed the NRD to similarly attenuate zippering and structure Tc of the SNARE complex containing the NRD (<a href=\"#fig11s2\">Figure 11- figure supplement 2</a>,<a href=\"#fig11s3\">3</a>). This finding suggests that Munc18-1 may transit between the NRD-dependent and the NRD-independent SNARE-binding modes, consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rathore et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hu et al., 2011</a>)."

The refolding process was reversible and fast in the force range of 4-8 pN, with an average equilibrium force of 6.1 (\u00b10.8) pN and an extension change of ~4 nm (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>). This transition required both Munc18-1 and the NRD, because the transition disappeared when either Munc18-1 was omitted or the NRD was removed. We concluded that the transition resulted from the Munc18-1-mediated transition of the syntaxin molecule between the closed conformation and the open conformation (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dulubova et al., 1999</a>). The structure of the open conformation was not determined. Consequently, we estimated a lower limit of ~\u22127 k<sub>B</sub>T for the free energy of the closed state relative to the open state, based on the measured mechanical work required to unfold the closed state. The relatively small energy difference revealed that the closed syntaxin could spontaneously open to participate in SNARE assembly. This finding is surprising, because it is generally believed that Munc18-1 tightly binds the closed syntaxin with nano-molar affinity, or \u221220 k<sub>B</sub>T association free energy (<a href=\"#bib2\">Burkhardt et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Misura et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Colbert et al., 2013</a>). However, our measurement is consistent with a recent observation that syntaxin can spontaneously open (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pertsinidis et al., 2013</a>). Given the overall low frequency to observe the syntaxin transition under our experimental conditions (&lt;0.01 s<sup>-1</sup>), Munc18-1 must remain attached to the syntaxin molecule during the whole syntaxin transition process (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>), suggesting a multivalent interaction between Munc18-1 and syntaxin (<a href=\"#bib11\">Colbert et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Burkhardt et al., 2008</a>). This finding shows that Munc18-1 binding and syntaxin closing do not necessarily coincide: syntaxin could stay in an open state while Munc18-1 remained attached to part of the syntaxin molecule, including the NRD (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hu et al., 2011</a>). The multivalent interaction also reconciles the marginal stability of the closed syntaxin observed by us and the overall high affinity between Munc18-1 and syntaxin."

The N-peptide was free to bind Munc18-1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Burkhardt et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rathore et al., 2010</a>). Syntaxin alone unfolded in a force range of 15-25 pN and refolded at 3-7 pN, due to irreversible unfolding and refolding of the H<sub>abc</sub> domain (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13C</a>). In the presence of 10 \u00b5M Munc18-1 in the solution, we found another transition in the force range of 3-8 pN that only occurred in the presence of the folded H<sub>abc</sub>, which represents the Munc18-1-mediated syntaxin opening and closing transition (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13B</a>). The transition was reversible (FECs #4 and #2), but with much smaller transition rate than that seen in the previous construct (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>). As a result, the extension flicking during pulling or relaxation was not seen in some FECs, such as FEC #3 in <a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13C</a>. Thus, the syntaxin transition took place in a similar low-force range with a similar extension change as observed in the previous SNARE construct (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12C</a>), confirming the marginal stability of the closed syntaxin state. As a result, the presence of NRD did not significantly reduce the probability for Munc18-1 to mediate de\u00a0novo SNARE assembly (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), although the unfolded SNARE motif in syntaxin could alternatively enter the closed state (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12C</a>). The different transition kinetics seen in the two syntaxin constructs is not surprising, because the syntaxin molecule was pulled in approximately perpendicular directions (compare <a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13A</a> to <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12C</a>). It is known that protein folding kinetics, but not folding energy, strongly depends on the pulling direction (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gao et al., 2011</a>)."

We found that SNARE assembly exhibited different sensitivity to mutations that correlates with their various phenotypes in\u00a0vivo. Compared to the wild-type SNARE complex, the NTD mutation V39A/V42A reduces the number of docked vesicles, but does not change the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion rate of the vesicles in the readily releasable pool in chromaffin cells, as was derived from electrophysiological measurements (<a href=\"#bib74\">Walter et al., 2010</a>). In parallel, our measurements showed that the same mutation destabilized NTD by 3 k<sub>B</sub>T with no change in CTD zippering energy (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The comparison suggests that NTD association is responsible for docking, but not vesicle fusion and that the NTD folding energy dictates the number of docked vesicles. Accordingly, the NTD association and dissociation reaches dynamic equilibrium, consistent with dynamic vesicle docking and undocking observed in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro (<a href=\"#bib82\">Zenisek et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Thus, we predicted that the reduced NTD association rate of the mutant observed by us (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) should decrease the fusion rate of the vesicles in the sustained releasable pool (SRP). Indeed, the SRP fusion rate of the mutant is reduced by ~50% (<a href=\"#bib74\">Walter et al., 2010</a>), confirming the prediction. Therefore, NTD association energy and kinetics contribute to the magnitude and rate of vesicle docking, respectively."

Interestingly, I67N (+4) in SNAP-25B is a dominant mutation identified from a patient with myasthenia, ataxia, and intellectual disability (<a href=\"#bib63\">Shen et al., 2014</a>). It is found that this mutation impaired neuromuscular transmission. These results demonstrated that the layers +4, +5, and +6 are crucial for CTD zippering and membrane fusion. In contrast, syntaxin T251I (+7) in syntaxin enhanced CTD zippering and is found to increase both spontaneous and evoked exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lagow et al., 2007</a>). However, flies carrying this mutation become paralyzed at 38\u00b0C. These findings are consistent with the existence of a metastable partially zippered SNARE complex in the docked state (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kyoung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lou et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Shin et al., 2014</a>) and mutations that stabilize CTD destabilize the half-zippered SNARE complex, leading to mis-regulated exocytosis and reduced precision of neurotransmission. Thus, the stabilities of different SNARE domains appear to be optimized to balance the accuracy and speed of membrane fusion. Finally, other CTD mutations, A67S (+3) and L84A (+8), do not significantly change the CTD folding energy and rate, nor exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib74\">Walter et al., 2010</a>). In conclusion, CTD zippering directly drives membrane fusion by tightly coupling its folding energy to lowering the energy barrier of membrane fusion, thereby increasing the fusion rate."

By applying high-resolution optical tweezers, we have systematically measured the folding energies and kinetics of both wild-type and mutant SNARE complexes in the absence and presence of Munc18-1. Because of the stage-wise SNARE assembly, crosslinking at the N-terminal edge of NTD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) slightly affects the measured NTD energy, but not energies and kinetics of other domains (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Zorman et al., 2014</a>).

Combining with previous results, we propose a working model to account for the multiple roles of Munc18-1 in stage-wise SNARE zippering and membrane fusion (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a>). First, we confirmed the previous observation that Munc18-1 only loosely closes syntaxin and associates with open syntaxin (states i and ii) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Christie et al., 2012</a>). The marginal stability of the closed syntaxin may explain why Munc13 further enhances syntaxin opening, despite the weak interaction between Munc13 and syntaxin (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ma et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ma et al., 2011</a>). Second, we observed that Munc18-1 efficiently initiates SNARE assembly (from state ii to state v). Because this activity is NRD-independent, Munc18-1 likely directly binds SNARE motifs to promote SNARE assembly (states ii and iii) (<a href=\"#bib64\">Shi et al., 2011</a>). Third, Munc18-1 stabilizes the half-zippered SNARE complex in an NRD-dependent manner (state v). This activity is strongly force-dependent and disappears at a force below ~15 pN. Fourth, we found that Munc18-1 associates with the t-SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib83\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pertsinidis et al., 2013</a>) and induces Tc folding in an NRD-independent manner (state vi). Finally, we did not find evidence that Munc18-1 stabilized the fully assembly SNARE complex in our single-molecule experiments, consistent with a recent report (<a href=\"#bib83\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Although Munc18-1 is shown to stabilize trans-SNARE complexes in another report, the effect of stabilization is only minor (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lou et al., 2015</a>). Thus, we conclude that Munc18-1 mainly enhances membrane fusion by catalyzing SNARE assembly, rather than by stabilizing the fully assembled SNARE complex. Consistent with this view, the rate of membrane fusion poorly correlate with the binding affinity between SM proteins and the fully assembled SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Shen et al., 2015</a>). In particular, SNARE mutations that compromise interactions between the fully assembled SNARE complexes and their cognate SM proteins can support membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib48\">Peng and Gallwitz, 2004</a>). Taking together, we conclude that Munc18-1 mainly acts on the folding intermediates of SNAREs to chaperone their assembly."

                        "text": "The Munc18-1-regulated SNARE assembly observed by us corroborates or clarifies many key findings on the role of SM proteins in SNARE assembly and membrane fusion. During revision of this work, Baker et al. reported the crystal structures of fungus SM protein Vps33 bound with its cognate individual Vam3 and Nyv1 SNAREs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baker et al., 2015</a>). These proteins mediate vesicle fusion with vacuoles or endosomes. In particular, Vam3 and Nyv1 are homologs of syntaxin and VAMP2 belonging to the same Qa- and R-SNARE families (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fasshauer et al., 1998</a>), respectively. They found that Vps33 interacts with the entire Qa- and R-SNARE motifs through two non-overlapping surfaces on Vps33 and aligns the SNARE helical NTDs in proximity and register (state iii). Because the structures of all SNARE complexes and SM proteins are highly conserved, they predicted that SM proteins serve as a template to initiate SNARE assembly into a partially zippered complex. Our discoveries of Munc18-1-mediated de\u00a0novo\u00a0SNARE assembly and half-zippered SNARE complex strongly support this prediction, which in turn offers a molecular mechanism for our observations (state iii). In addition, we previously showed that representative SNARE complexes mediating diverse membrane trafficking pathways slowly initiate their NTD assembly and pause in half-zippered states. These observations make SM-mediated SNARE assembly necessary. Our findings also corroborates that Munc18-1 enhances assembly of trans-SNARE complexes, thereby promoting liposome-liposome fusion (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rathore et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Shen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Shen et al., 2015</a>). Finally, the N-peptide is essential for recruiting Munc18-1 to the fusion site to assist SNARE assembly (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rathore et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, once the trans-SNARE complexes are formed, the N-peptide is not required and can be cleaved from syntaxin SNARE motif without compromising the subsequent liposome fusion in\u00a0vitro, indicating that Munc18-1 binds the trans-SNARE complex in an NRD-independent manner before fusion (state vi). Consistent with this observation, we considered that after trans-SNARE assembly, Munc18-1 switches to the NRD-independent Tc binding mode observed by us. Munc18-1 then induces Tc folding and greatly stabilizes the t-SNARE to facilitate SNARE assembly and membrane fusion similar to Vc and Vn peptides (<a href=\"#bib40\">Melia et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pobbati et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, our results are consistent with other potentially essential roles of SM proteins in membrane fusion, which are to protect disassembly of t- and trans-SNARE complexes by NSF (<a href=\"#bib78\">Xu et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lobingier et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zhao et al., 2015</a>) and to proofread SNARE zippering (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lobingier et al., 2014</a>). These comparisons suggest that SM proteins act as chaperones to enhance SNARE assembly, which is essential for membrane fusion."

We noticed that Munc18-1 and other SM proteins significantly enhance membrane fusion only under special conditions. Shen and co-workers showed that incubating SNARE-anchored liposomes in the presence of Munc18-1 at 4\u00baC or adding crowding agents, such as 100 mg/ml Ficoll 70, in the fusion reaction is required to observe Munc18-1-enhanced liposome fusion (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Yu et al., 2015</a>). In general, SM proteins appear to weakly associate with both Qa- and R-SNAREs to form the template that initiates SNARE assembly (<a href=\"#bib47\">Parisotto et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Xu et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Baker et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lobingier and Merz, 2012</a>). The energy barrier for syntaxin to transit from a closed conformation to an open conformation further impedes formation of the template between Munc18-1 and syntaxin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Baker et al., 2015</a>). The use of N-terminally crosslinked SNARE constructs in our experiments may facilitate Munc18-1 binding to both syntaxin and VAMP2 to form the template required for SNARE assembly (state iii). In addition, the presence of a single SNAP-25 molecule in our experiments may increase the contrast to observe Munc18-1-mediated de\u00a0novo SNARE assembly. With a high concentration of SNAP-25 in the solution in ensemble experiments, the SM-mediated SNARE assembly may be obscured by the high rate of intrinsic SNARE assembly (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baker et al., 2015</a>)."

Our measurements showed that most of the mutant SNARE complexes are still more stable than many SNARE complexes mediating other membrane trafficking pathways (<a href=\"#bib88\">Zorman et al., 2014</a>). As a result, SNARE-mediated fusion in the absence of Munc18-1 is remarkably insensitive to CTD folding energies (<a href=\"#bib88\">Zorman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Shen et al., 2007</a>). We hypothesize that Munc18-1 helps to form a super-complex containing Munc18-1, trans-SNARE complexes, and other regulatory proteins with approximately fixed stoichiometry to efficiently and specifically drive membrane fusion. Without Munc18-1-dependent constraints on the number of trans-SNARE complexes, the energy loss caused by SNARE mutation may be compensated by the energy gain from recruitment of more SNARE complexes to the fusion site. As a result, membrane fusion mediated by SNARE alone has variable number of SNARE complexes involved (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hernandez et al., 2014</a>), which causes non-specific membrane fusion. Thus, Munc18-1 intimately chaperone SNARE folding from syntaxin to multiple trans-SNARE complexes, making it indispensable for SNARE-mediated membrane fusion."

Briefly, a laser beam with a wavelength of 1064 nm was expanded, collimated, and split into two orthogonally polarized beams. One beam was reflected by a mirror attached to a nano-positioning stage that could tip/tilt in two axes with high resolution (Mad City Labs, WI). The two beams were then combined, further expanded, and focused by a water-immersion 60X objective with a numerical aperture of 1.2 (Olympus, PA) to form two optical traps. One optical trap was moved by turning the mirror to control the force applied to a single molecule. The outgoing laser beams were collimated by an identical objective, split again by polarization, and projected to two position-sensitive detectors (Pacific Silicon Sensor, CA) to detect bead positions using back-focal-plane interferometry. The force constants of both optical traps were calibrated by Brownian motion of the trapped beads (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>).

We assumed that NTD and MD zippering proceeded by folding of VAMP2 on the structured t-SNARE template and that CTD zippering was accompanied by concurrent folding of both VAMP2 and Tc. The LD transition was considered to be symmetrical zippering of syntaxin and VAMP2 and was characterized as before (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gao et al., 2012</a>). To derive conformations of the intermediate and transition states in the folding pathway from the overlapping CTD, MD, and NTD transitions, we defined a simplified energy landscape (<i>l<sub>i</sub></i>,<i>V<sub>i</sub></i>), characterized by the contour length <i>l<sub>i\u00a0</sub></i>of <i>i</i>-th intermediate state or transition state and its associated free energy <i>V<sub>i</sub></i> at zero force.

Two technical features distinguish this work from earlier efforts. First, the authors figured out how to crosslink VAMP and syntaxin so that they could observe assembly as well as disassembly. Second, they determined assembly energetics/kinetics for a well-chosen set of VAMP (and a small number of syntaxin and SNAP-25) mutants. They then went on to determine assembly energetics/kinetics in the presence of Munc18. The authors demonstrate: (<a href=\"#bib1\">1</a>) that regions within the SNARE bundle are responsible for a series of assembly intermediates (at least under the conditions of the experiment) that they propose correspond to well-characterized stages in vesicle docking and membrane fusion: (<a href=\"#bib2\">2</a>) that Munc18 can bind and influence the structures and energetics of SNARE assembly intermediates, providing support for the idea that Munc18 functions as an assembly chaperone."

It is also possible, however, that the t-SNARE \u03b1-helices remain intact, while unfolding of VAMP2 progresses beyond the point shown, for example, up to layer -1 or -2. How do the authors differentiate between these possibilities? Since the C-terminal fragment of VAMP2 (VAMP2 49-96) induces tight folding of the C-terminal part of the t-SNARE proteins (many data in the previous literature and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> in this manuscript), addition of the C-terminal VAMP2 fragment should decrease the extension value of states 4 and 5 if the t-SNARE complex is indeed partially melted as the authors suggest. The authors might also (in part 2) repeat this experiment with Munc18, because they claim that Munc18, like the C-terminal VAMP2 fragment, chaperones the C-terminal end of the t-SNARE complex."

But when several SNARE complexes are pulling on the same two membranes and the membranes are pulling back on them, as is the case for exocytic fusion (indeed, membrane fusion generally), then the relative heights of barriers, etc., might well be different. That difference doesn't diminish the value of the numbers provided here, but it does rule out egregious overstatement. Even the interpretation in the third paragraph, subsection \u201cEnergetics and kinetics of SNARE assembly underlying exocytosis\u201d, seems stretched \u2013 why do the phenotypes of those mutations reveal \"an essential role of independent MD assembly\"? Yes, messing up the MD messes up the mouse, but how does even the correspondence to the kinetic observations reported here demonstrate \"independent\" (rather than \"concerted\", with the other segments) assembly?"

The first is that unfolding in the C-terminal half of the SNARE complex, previously treated as one process, has now been resolved into CTD and MD unfolding (states 3 and 4), presumably because they did less temporal averaging of the data and plotted the extension traces over 1kHz. The second difference is that they moved the crosslinking site to layer -6. This difference likely separated NTD unfolding (state 5) from dissociation of SNAP-25 (state 6) more clearly than in Gao et al. (2012), in which the crosslinker was at layer -7. Thus, before dissociation of SNAP-25 at a higher force, they could see reversible NTD unfolding and refolding transitions."

They resolve the C-terminal unfolding into two intermediates (3 and 4). The transition between the two involves unfolding (or refolding) of the middle part between the +2 and the zeroth layers (but this analysis may need to be refined). The mutations in the +1 or +2 layer accordingly affect the stability of these intermediates. Thus, the probability of observing intermediate 3 is selectively reduced (i.e., the unfolding process pauses less frequently at the +2 layer)."

It is hard to understand how the reduced observation of the intermediate 3 (observed for the L60A and L63A mutants) supports these rather strong arguments. In the third paragraph of the subsection \u201cEnergetics and kinetics of SNARE assembly underlying exocytosis\u201d, the authors allude to unpublished results, but this citation is not an appropriate way to justify the arguments.

How do the authors differentiate between these possibilities? Since the C-terminal fragment of VAMP2 (VAMP2 49-96) induces tight folding of the C-terminal part of the t-SNARE proteins (many data in the previous literature and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> in this manuscript), addition of the C-terminal VAMP2 fragment should decrease the extension value of states 4 and 5 if the t-SNARE complex is indeed partially melted as the authors suggest.

In our model, SNAREs fold and unfold in a sequential and stepwise manner, between the well-defined fully assembled state (state 1) and the fully unfolded state (state 6). The total extension change is fixed by the extension difference between the two states. We essentially performed an interpolation to locate the conformations of intermediate states based on their measured relative extensions. Thus, an increase in the extension change of one folding step must be compensated by a decrease in the extension change of another folding step. In our analysis, we first determine the t-SNARE conformation (state 5) based on its extension relative to the completely unfolded state (state 6) and the Vc-peptide-bound state (state 8 in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The t-SNARE transitions into both states are modeled as helix-coil transitions and the measured extension changes determine the lengths of the syntaxin helix involved in the transitions (please see Fig. S10 in Gao et al., 2012. This analysis reveals a frayed t-SNARE conformation as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>. This conformation is also supported by our extensive unpublished data on directly pulling the t-SNARE complex. As is hypothesized by the reviewer, we did observe extension shortening due to binding of the Vc peptide 49-96 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and Munc18-1 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Then we <i>simultaneously</i> fit the extensions of the intermediates 2-4 to the experimental measurements to determine the borders of these states. The fitting avoids the scenario proposed by the reviewer, because shifting the border between states 4 and 5 towards the N-terminus will shorten the extension change of NTD transition."

The first is that unfolding in the C-terminal half of the SNARE complex, previously treated as one process, has now been resolved into CTD and MD unfolding (states 3 and 4), presumably because they did less temporal averaging of the data and plotted the extension traces over 1kHz. The second difference is that they moved the crosslinking site to layer -6. This difference likely separated NTD unfolding (state 5) from dissociation of SNAP-25 (state 6) more clearly than in Gao et al. (2012), in which the crosslinker was at layer -7. Thus, before dissociation of SNAP-25 at a higher force, they could see reversible NTD unfolding and refolding transitions. In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>, the authors used the high temporal (over 1 kHz) and spatial resolution provided by the optical tweezers to resolve detailed structural transitions occurring in a single neuronal SNARE complex \u2013 a substantial technical accomplishment. They resolve the C-terminal unfolding into two intermediates (3 and 4). The transition between the two involves unfolding (or refolding) of the middle part between the +2 and the zeroth layers (but this analysis may need to be refined). The mutations in the +1 or +2 layer accordingly affect the stability of these intermediates. Thus, the probability of observing intermediate 3 is selectively reduced (i.e., the unfolding process pauses less frequently at the +2 layer).</i>"

It is hard to understand how the reduced observation of the intermediate 3 (observed for the L60A and L63A mutants) supports these rather strong arguments.

We have added <a href=\"#fig11s3\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 3</a> to show Munc18-1-induced folding of Tc in the SNARE complex containing NRD. Second, we agree with the reviewers that our original description on the difference between state 9 and state 10 is confusing. We have revised the relevant sentences. Basically, the two states differ in their Munc18-1 binding sites on the SNARE complex, the VAMP2 zippering states, and mechanical stabilities. Third, we have added a few sentences at the beginning of the section to rationalize the experiments described in this section and emphasize their biological relevance. Previous experiments show that, although the NRD is initially required to recruit Munc18-1 to bind the trans-SNARE complex, the NRD becomes dispensable for the subsequent membrane fusion, indicating the existence of an NRD-independent Munc18-1-SNARE binding mode. The NRD-independent, Munc18-1-mediated Tc folding discovered by us is consistent with the predicted binding mode. We believe this binding mode is important, because it shares the same mechanism by which Vc and Vn peptides enhances SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in vitro. Based on these thoughts and our clarifications, we kept <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a> as a main figure. In addition, this figure strengthens our argument for multiple Munc18-1 binding modes and their roles in SNARE assembly and membrane fusion depicted in <a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a>."
