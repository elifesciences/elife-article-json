Here, we show that Nup98-HoxA9, a fusion between Nup98 and the homeobox transcription factor HoxA9, forms nuclear aggregates that frequently associate with facultative heterochromatin. We demonstrate that stable expression of Nup98-HoxA9 in mouse embryonic stem cells selectively induces the expression of <i>Hox</i> cluster genes. Genome-wide binding site analysis revealed that Nup98-HoxA9 is preferentially targeted and accumulated at <i>Hox</i> cluster regions where the export factor Crm1 is originally prebound. In addition, leptomycin B, an inhibitor of Crm1, disassembled nuclear Nup98-HoxA9 dots, resulting in the loss of chromatin binding of Nup98-HoxA9 and Nup98-HoxA9-mediated activation of <i>Hox</i> genes. Collectively, our results indicate that highly selective targeting of Nup98-fusion proteins to <i>Hox</i> cluster regions via prebound Crm1 induces the formation of higher order chromatin structures that causes aberrant <i>Hox</i> gene regulation."

Here, we show that Nup98-HoxA9, a fusion between Nup98 and the homeobox transcription factor HoxA9, forms nuclear aggregates that frequently associate with facultative heterochromatin. We demonstrate that stable expression of Nup98-HoxA9 in mouse embryonic stem cells selectively induces the expression of <i>Hox</i> cluster genes. Genome-wide binding site analysis revealed that Nup98-HoxA9 is preferentially targeted and accumulated at <i>Hox</i> cluster regions where the export factor Crm1 is originally prebound. In addition, leptomycin B, an inhibitor of Crm1, disassembled nuclear Nup98-HoxA9 dots, resulting in the loss of chromatin binding of Nup98-HoxA9 and Nup98-HoxA9-mediated activation of <i>Hox</i> genes. Collectively, our results indicate that highly selective targeting of Nup98-fusion proteins to <i>Hox</i> cluster regions via prebound Crm1 induces the formation of higher order chromatin structures that causes aberrant <i>Hox</i> gene regulation."

These molecules move across the membrane that surrounds the nucleus through pores made of proteins. One of these pore-forming proteins is called Nup98. The gene that produces Nup98 is frequently mutated in leukemia, where part of it becomes fused to regions of other unrelated genes. The proteins made from these combined genes are known as \u201cfusion proteins\u201d."

During cell differentiation, cells change which sets of genes they activate to become specific types of cells. A family of genes called <i>Hox</i> genes (to which the gene for HoxA9 belongs) is critical in cell differentiation and thus must be fine-tuned. It is also known that the <i>Hox</i> genes form clusters, and its activation is partly controlled by how tightly the DNA is packaged."

This interaction may change how the <i>Hox</i> gene is packaged in the nucleus. A future challenge will be to reveal how the Nup98-HoxA9 fusion protein and Crm1 on <i>Hox</i> cluster genes control gene expression."

To address the role of Nup98-HoxA9, we first characterized in detail the intranuclear distribution of these dots. When expressed in HeLa cells, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged Nup98-HoxA9 was easily distinguished as small nuclear dots. In contrast, Nup98 FG repeats were detected as large dots mostly associated with the nucleolus, and HoxA9 C-terminus containing the homeodomain, HoxA9-Ct, showed an even nucleopolasmic distribution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), consistent with earlier reports (<a href=\"#bib42\">Oka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Xu and Powers, 2010</a>). We noticed that Nup98-HoxA9 dots were not randomly localized within the nucleus, but were frequently adjacent to 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole\u00a0(DAPI)-dense heterochromatin regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) as revealed by co-staining with DAPI. Furthermore, immunocytochemical analysis using monoclonal antibodies specific to histone modifications (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kimura et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) revealed that those dots were frequently associated with H3K9me2 and H3K27me3, facultative heterochromatin markers (<a href=\"#bib59\">Trojer and Reinberg, 2007</a>), but not with the marker for constitutive heterochromatin H3K9me3 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Peters et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">Rice et al., 2003</a>).

Immunocytochemical analysis using stable ES clones demonstrated that FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9 had a similar localization pattern to transiently expressed EGFP-Nup98-HoxA9 in ES cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Immunoblotting using monoclonal antibody that is raised against the N-terminal (A.A. 1\u2013466) of Nup98 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fukuhara et al., 2005</a>) revealed that FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9 was not overexpressed compared with endogenous Nup98 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Unexpectedly, we found that FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9 expressing stable ES cell clones (Nup98-HoxA9 ES) had distinct flat colonies, which was in contrast to tighter colonies of spherical shape detected in parental ES,\u00a0Nup98FG, or HoxA9-Ct expressing ES cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Further experiments revealed that Nup98-HoxA9 ES cells expressed stem cell marker genes, and had proliferation rates comparable to those of parental ES cells, indicating that they were not differentiated (data not shown). In addition, Nup98-HoxA9 ES cells show more resistance to spontaneous cell differentiation in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), compared with parental ES, Nup98FG, or HoxA9-Ct expressing ES clones (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

We found that a small fraction of genes (less than 1%) were strongly induced (more than 10-fold) in Nup98-HoxA9 ES cells compared with their expression levels in parental or HoxA9-Ct ES cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Interestingly, we noticed that <i>Hox</i> cluster genes were highly activated in Nup98-HoxA9 ES cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). In particular, more than a half of the top 32 upregulated genes, which were common in both of Nup98-HoxA9 clone #1 and Nup98-HoxA9 clone #9, were <i>Hox</i> cluster genes belonging to <i>Hox-A, -B</i>, and <i>-C</i> clusters (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), which were validated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). These results suggest that there is a good correlation between the intranuclear distribution of Nup98-HoxA9 and its function in transcription, since <i>Hox</i> gene cluster regions are known to be organized as facultative heterochromatin (<a href=\"#bib59\">Trojer and Reinberg, 2007</a>)."

On the other hand, it is known that other nucleoporins containing such dense FG repeat domains are also implicated in oncogenic transformation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kasper et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">Xu and Powers, 2009</a>). Therefore, we created chimeric Nup-fusions by replacing Nup98 FG repeats with those from hNup153FG (A.A.1118\u20131475) and hNup214FG (A.A.1605\u20132090), which have been demonstrated to be functionally exchangeable in experiments that addressed the transforming ability in NIH3T3 cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kasper et al., 1999</a>). When these chimeric proteins (Nup153-HoxA9 and Nup214-HoxA9) were expressed in HeLa cells, they were not distributed as distinct fine nuclear dots observed in the case of the Nup98-HoxA9 fusion (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), in agreement with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib66\">Xu and Powers, 2013</a>)."

Next, the effect of these Nup-fusions on the expression of <i>Hox</i> genes was monitored in established stable ES cell lines. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, the expression of Nup153-HoxA9 or Nup214-HoxA9 did not affect the expression of <i>Hox</i> cluster genes.

We speculated that cohesive properties of Nup98FG (<a href=\"#bib46\">Patel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Xu and Powers, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yamada et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schmidt and Gorlich, 2015</a>) required to form nuclear aggregates (<a href=\"#bib18\">Griffis et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Oka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Patel et al., 2007</a>) containing Crm1 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Takeda et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">Oka et al., 2010</a>) may be important for the pathogenic function. Indeed, the ectopic expression of Nup98-HoxA9 in HeLa cells caused sequestration of nucleoplasmic and nuclear envelope-localized Crm1 on Nup98-HoxA9 dots within the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, top). When we stained Nup98-HoxA9 ES cells, we also noticed partial recruitment of Crm1 to FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9 dots (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, bottom). We have previously demonstrated that treatment with leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of the cargo binding of Crm1 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kudo et al., 1998</a>), causes a dynamic redistribution of Nup98 nuclear dots (<a href=\"#bib42\">Oka et al., 2010</a>). This finding indicated that Nup98-Crm1 association is dependent on the cargo binding status of Crm1; therefore, we examined whether such properties of Nup98FG were still preserved in Nup98-HoxA9. When Nup98-HoxA9 ES cells were treated with LMB for 2\u2009hr, the dots disappeared (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The disappearance of dots was concomitant with a modest decrease in the protein level (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, LMB treatment did not affect the localization of full-length HoxA9, Nup153-HoxA9, and the majority of Nup214-HoxA9, except for a few nuclear dots of Nup214-HoxA9 that disappeared upon LMB treatment (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results indicate that Crm1 plays a critical role in the maintenance of Nup98-HoxA9 dots in ES cells."

Aggregation plot revealed that the peak of FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9 binding site was severely diminished but not shifted by LMB treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, left top). Furthermore, FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9 was preferentially targeted to the chromatin sites that originally bound Crm1 (the Crm1 binding site in control ES cells) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, right top). Aggregation plots of the Crm1 binding signal revealed that the peak of Crm1 binding was not shifted, but rather significantly enhanced by the expression of FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, left bottom). In addition, the Crm1 signal also accumulated at the FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9 binding site (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, right bottom). Statistical analyses confirmed these results (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We also performed an\u00a0analysis of the\u00a0target genes that bound FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9 or Crm1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As expected, the number of FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9 target genes was severely decreased by LMB treatment (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, top left). On the other hand, the number of Crm1 target genes were significantly increased by the expression of FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9; however, the majority of these genes were not overlapping (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, top right), examples of which were observed in the vicinity of <i>Hox</i>-cluster regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, see green arrows near <i>Hox-A (Skap2</i>) or <i>Hox-C</i> cluster). In these regions, it is likely that FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9 first binds to chromatin loci where Crm1 is not present, and then, Crm1 is recruited to FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9-bound sites, which results in the increase of Crm1-target genes on a whole genome level (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, compare bottom two panels).

Therefore, we examined the effects of various epigenetic inhibitors on nuclear Nup98-HoxA9 dots. While most of these agents only showed a minor effect on the localization pattern of Nup98-HoxA9 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), trichostatin A (TSA) treatment caused a drastic redistribution of FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9, a significant increase in the number and a significant decrease in the size of dots, which mimicked that observed in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), concomitant with the redistribution of endogenous Crm1 (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also confirmed that TSA treatment caused an upregulation of the FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9 protein and mRNA (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which occurred presumably due to the reactivation of partially silenced transgenes cloned in the Tol2 transposon vector. A similar phenomenon was also observed in the case of transgenes created by the Sleeping Beauty transposon (<a href=\"#bib15\">Garrison et al., 2007</a>). Next, we examined the effects of TSA treatment on the genome-wide chromatin binding of Crm1 or FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9.

Interestingly, it is known that treatment of ES cells with TSA at a concentration of 50 nM drastically affects bivalent histone modifications H3K4me3 (upregulation) and H3K27me3 (downregulation), in addition to the acetylation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Karantzali et al., 2008</a>). Since bivalent histone marks are critical for the regulation of <i>Hox</i> cluster genes in ES cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">Pan et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib71\">Zhao et al., 2007</a>), we speculate that TSA treatment may dramatically modulate the epigenetic status of <i>Hox</i> cluster regions. Indeed, as shown in <a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, TSA treatment caused a moderate upregulation of H3K4me3 and a robust decrease of H3K27me3 on the promoter region of <i>Hox-A</i> cluster genes, which is in line with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib24\">Karantzali et al., 2008</a>). These results suggest that inactive histone marks, including H3K27me3, are important for the recruitment of Crm1 and FLAG-Nup98-HoxA9 to the <i>Hox-A</i> cluster region."

Although activation of several <i>Hox</i> genes by Nup98-HoxA9 has been previously reported in other types of cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calvo et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Takeda et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ghannam et al., 2004</a>), those effects were relatively weak and not highly specific, which is in contrast to the pronounced changes observed in our present study. We believe that such variable outcomes could stem from two possible reasons. First, the chromatin structure, epigenetic status or chromatin-bound protein complexes of <i>Hox</i> cluster regions may be dissimilar in different cell types, causing varying susceptibility to Nup98-HoxA9-mediated chromatin modifications. Second, the association status of Crm1 with <i>Hox</i> cluster gene loci, which is a prerequisite for the selective deregulation of <i>Hox</i> cluster genes, may be differentially modulated in different cell types, causing cell type-specific variability in the Nup98-HoxA9-mediated gene expression."

Thus, our results suggest that the ability of Nup98 FG repeats to form nuclear dot-like structures is critical in <i>Hox</i> gene activation. We propose a model whereby the interaction of Nup98-HoxA9 with prebound Crm1 induces the alteration of chromatin structures specifically on <i>Hox</i> cluster regions and this modification, in turn, causes robust activation of gene expression."

                        "text": "It is known that <i>Hox</i> clusters in ES cells harbor a distinctive long-range histone modification signature called the bivalent motif, which possesses both transcriptionally active H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 marks (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</a>). This modification is maintained through the activity of polycomb complexes (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schwartz and Pirrotta, 2007</a>). Our results demonstrate that Nup98-HoxA9/Crm1 binding to <i>Hox</i> region is sensitive to TSA treatment, which results in a robust decrease of the H3K27me3 mark on <i>Hox</i> cluster genes. Moreover, the expression of Nup98-HoxA9 causes a significant increase of the active histone mark H3K4me3 on <i>Hox</i> cluster region genes. Previously, it was reported that the FG repeat region of Nup98 interacts with histone acetyltransferases CBP and p300 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kasper et al., 1999</a>). In addition, MBD-R2/NSL and Trx histone modifying complexes have been demonstrated to interact with full-length Nup98 in fly (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pascual-Garcia et al., 2014</a>). Thus, we speculate that Nup98-HoxA9 first binds to facultative heterochromatin and then recruits histone and/or chromatin modifying enzymes to induce active histone modifications and a subsequent activation of <i>Hox</i> cluster genes. Importantly, in CD133+ hematopoietic stem cells, histone modifications of <i>Hox-A</i> and <i>Hox-B</i> loci are also bivalent (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cui et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that <i>Hox</i> cluster genes are similarly regulated both in ES and hematopoietic progenitor cells."

Mechanistically, Nup98-NSD1 binds to the promoter region of <i>Hox-A</i> cluster genes and modifies histones via its H3K36 methyltransferase activity (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 2007</a>). Similarly, Nup98-Jarid1a binds to di- or tri-methylated H3K4 of the <i>Hox-A</i> cluster region through its plant\u00a0homeodomain\u00a0(PHD) finger domain and causes deregulation of <i>Hox</i> genes activation (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). However, it remained unclear how the expression of these Nup98-fusions actually causes selective activation of <i>Hox</i> genes. Our results suggest that chromosome prebound Crm1 may recruit Nup98-NSD1, Nup98-Jarid1a, and possibly other Nup98-fusions to specific <i>Hox</i> cluster genes loci through its interaction with the Nup98FG repeat, which commonly exists in all Nup98-fusions. Unexpectedly, our data showed that Nup98FG could only weakly bind to <i>Hox-A</i> cluster region (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, since Nup98FG dots are frequently localized within the nucleolus (data not shown), and Nup98FG is more prone to form nuclear aggregates than Nup98-HoxA9 with only a weak nucleoplasmic diffuse staining (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), we speculate that Nup98FG is hardly accessible to the\u00a0genomic DNA, including the <i>Hox</i> cluster region, when expressed by itself."
