How incoming sensorimotor information is channeled and communicated between these anatomical modules is still poorly understood. In this study, we used transgenic mice expressing GFP in specific subsets of Purkinje cells that allowed us to target a given set of cerebellar modules. Combining in vitro recordings and photostimulation, we identified stereotyped patterns of functional synaptic organization between the granule cell layer and its main targets, the Purkinje cells, Golgi cells and molecular layer interneurons. Each type of connection displayed position-specific patterns of granule cell synaptic inputs that do not strictly match with anatomical boundaries but connect distant cortical modules. Although these patterns can be adjusted by activity-dependent processes, they were found to be consistent and predictable between animals. Our results highlight the operational rules underlying communication between modules in the cerebellar cortex."

How incoming sensorimotor information is channeled and communicated between these anatomical modules is still poorly understood. In this study, we used transgenic mice expressing GFP in specific subsets of Purkinje cells that allowed us to target a given set of cerebellar modules. Combining in vitro recordings and photostimulation, we identified stereotyped patterns of functional synaptic organization between the granule cell layer and its main targets, the Purkinje cells, Golgi cells and molecular layer interneurons. Each type of connection displayed position-specific patterns of granule cell synaptic inputs that do not strictly match with anatomical boundaries but connect distant cortical modules. Although these patterns can be adjusted by activity-dependent processes, they were found to be consistent and predictable between animals. Our results highlight the operational rules underlying communication between modules in the cerebellar cortex."

A part of the brain at the back of the head, called the cerebellum, is organised into particularly well-defined modules and is important for fine-tuning and learning new movements. However, it is not clear if the pattern of connections between modules in the brain is broadly the same across different animals from the same species, or if it varies between individuals. This is partly because it has not been possible to identify the same cells across different individual animals, and thus measure whether the connections are different."

These groups of labeled Purkinje cells helped identify the boundaries of modules in the cerebellum. Valera et al. then stimulated another group of neurons, called the granule cells, that connect to Purkinje cells from several different modules. Measuring the resulting changes in the electrical activity of the Purkinje cells revealed the pattern of connections between these two types of neurons. These experiments showed that granule cells can connect Purkinje cells from distant modules and that neighbouring Purkinje cells often display similar connection patterns."

This suggests that, in identified modules, there is little variability in connection patterns between individuals. However, the patterns of connectivity could be altered by processes related to learning, indicating that they can be organized in different ways and still work. Further experiments then showed that different individuals display consistent patterns of connectivity between granule cells and other major cell types in the cerebellum. This finding suggests that while the basic modules in the cerebellum are similar across different individuals, the connections between modules can be shaped by experience."

However, much anatomical and functional evidence suggests that cerebellar modules consist of an array of microcircuits, each of which has a specific identity (<a href=\"#bib62\">Scott, 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lange et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brochu et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dehnes et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mateos et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sarna et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Shin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Xiao et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>). Cerebellar modules are defined by the topographical organization of climbing fiber (CF) inputs to Purkinje cells (PCs), originating in the inferior olive, and PC to cerebellar nuclei connections. Olivo-cortical and cortico-nuclear projections delimit parasagittal zones and subzones of the cerebellar cortex called \u2018microzones\u2019 having similar CF receptive fields (<a href=\"#bib49\">Oscarsson, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Voogd and Glickstein, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Voogd and Ruigrok, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Buisseret-Delmas and Angaut, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Voogd, 1967</a>). Thus, a microzone corresponds to the cortical element of a cerebellar module. PCs from a given microzone receive and integrate information from specific parts of the body and project to restricted areas of the cerebellar nuclei, which in turn send the cerebellar computation to the cerebral cortex, brainstem or spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib74\">Voogd and Glickstein, 1998</a>). The complete olivo-cortico-nuclear loop defines the cerebellar module (Figure 1A; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1; for review see <a href=\"#bib57\">Ruigrok, 2011</a>). Mossy fiber (MF) inputs, the second major excitatory pathway of the cerebellum, partially overlap with the receptive fields of CFs when originating from the same body part (<a href=\"#bib30\">Garwicz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pijpers et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Voogd et al., 2003</a>). Therefore, it has been suggested that the cerebellar cortex is subdivided into individual microzones each controlling a given set of muscles (<a href=\"#bib3\">Apps and Garwicz, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Thach et al., 1992</a>)."

The level of expression of some of these markers has been associated with specific synaptic properties and intracellular transduction pathways at the parallel fiber (PF)-PC or CF-PC synapses (<a href=\"#bib79\">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Paukert et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cerminara et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hawkes, 2014</a>) leading to the description of different intrinsic properties of PCs and different rules for plasticity induction between zebrin positive and negative bands. Combined with the regional differences in the cytoarchitecture of the cerebellar cortex (for review see <a href=\"#bib13\">Cerminara et al., 2015</a>), these findings demonstrate that the cerebellar cortex is composed of an ensemble of heterogeneous modules. Therefore, an appealing hypothesis would be that cell identity relies on its position in the cerebellar cortex and that specific communication rules between neighboring microzones might arise from this anatomical and neurochemical heterogeneity."

GCs have long transverse axons, the PFs, that make glutamatergic synapses with hundreds of PCs across several microzones (<a href=\"#bib35\">Harvey and Napper, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Thach et al., 1992</a>). PFs could thus define an associative pathway that enables MF inputs from one original microzone to communicate with a distant one. Paradoxically, several studies have shown that PCs are excited by a unique set of GCs localized in the same microzone as themselves (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen and Yarom, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bower and Woolston, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Brown and Bower, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Isope and Barbour, 2002</a>). These results suggest that local GCs provide the major input to PCs and that the majority of GC-PC synapses are silent (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ekerot and Jorntell, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Isope and Barbour, 2002</a>). In contrast, other studies demonstrated that PCs can be driven by a restricted subset of GCs belonging to a different microzone (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ekerot and J\u00f6rntell, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dean et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">J\u00f6rntell and Ekerot, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Ekerot and Jorntell, 2001</a>). Finally, recent studies have suggested that PCs can be excited by a broad range of GCs (<a href=\"#bib80\">Walter et al., 2009</a>) and that feedforward inhibition through the MF-GC-molecular interneuron pathway might play a role in the restriction of receptive fields in PCs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cramer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Santamaria et al., 2007</a>). Finally, this wide range of functional connectivity might explain the regional differences in information processing (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cramer et al., 2013</a>) underpinned by the molecular and cellular heterogeneity between individual microzones and by the specific topographical organization of MF and CF inputs in the cerebellar cortex."

Since CF projections share common boundaries with the zebrin II pattern of expression in PCs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004</a>), experiments were performed in the EAAT4-GFP strain of mice, in which zebrin II bands are defined by the expression of eGFP in PCs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; Materials and methods) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gincel et al., 2007</a>). The use of two distinct specific antibodies against zebrin II/aldolase C (Materials and methods) confirmed that EAAT4-eGFP mice express GFP in zebrin II bands (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By comparing EAAT4-eGFP/zebrin II expression and cortico-nuclear projections, we postulated that seven putative microzones extend to the P2<sup>+</sup> band on both sides of the midline (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Projections from these two precerebellar nuclei were mutually exclusive in lobules III and IV, identifying an alternation of two to three parasagittal bands (mean width = 193 \u00b1 24 \u00b5m, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>; n = 13 slices, N = 4 animals for cuneate projections; n = 4 slices, N = 1 animal for spinal projections) in the mediolateral axis. Intensity plot profiles of GFP labeling in the GC layer (Materials and methods) allowed us to determine the boundaries of individual MF bands (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Notably, when measuring the GFP level of expression, 22% of cuneate projections were found in the contralateral vermis, illustrating the importance of bilateral MF inputs. Interestingly, the comparison of the zebrin II pattern with MF inputs identified overlapping parasagittal bands (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ji and Hawkes, 1994</a>) with one shared boundary at the P2<sup>+</sup>/P2<sup>\u2212</sup> transition. Also, MF inputs subdivided the P1<sup>\u2212</sup> band into smaller regions. Finally, CF and MF (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) inputs delimit 13 regions having a unique combination of inputs between P2<sup>+</sup><sub>ipsi</sub> and P2<sup>+</sup><sub>contra</sub>. These regions might therefore correspond to smaller processing units than microzones (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ozden et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</a>).

Individual PCs (n = 49 cells, N = 18 animals) were whole-cell patch-clamped in P1<sup>+</sup>, P1<sup>\u2212</sup> and P2<sup>+</sup> zebrin II bands of EAAT4-GFP mice, and RuBi-glutamate was systematically uncaged in the GC layer using point-scan laser photostimulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; width mapped = 664 \u00b5m centered on the recorded cell; Materials and methods) on both sides of the midline while inhibitory transmission was blocked. As uncaging led to a compound synaptic current in PCs initiated by trains of action potentials in GCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; Materials and methods), the efficacy of GC patches in eliciting synaptic current in PCs was assessed by calculating the mean synaptic charge expressed as a Z-score (Materials and methods; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). This representation allowed us to compare GC input maps between PCs with different background noise. Since MFs from the external cuneate and the spinal cord project to the entire depth of the granule cell layer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), glutamate uncaging sites at various depths of the GC layer but at the same mediolateral position were pooled and the evoked maximal synaptic input was considered. This maximal response was used as an indicator of the connectivity strength between the GCs and the PC along the mediolateral axis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>). Interestingly, patterns of GC inputs in PCs were found to be highly heterogeneous (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), with dense local inputs (mean local charge = 10.3 \u00b1 13.8 pC, n = 49) and silent sites, that is, no GC patch had a Z-score &gt; 3.09 at any depth of the GC layer (38% of sites were silent; Z-score &lt; 3.09; Materials and methods). Remotely connected GC patches separated by silent sites were always found and were also frequently observed on contralateral sites (mean charge in distant patches = 6.1 \u00b1 8.8 pC. Mean distance from the local peak = 215 \u00b1 86 \u00b5m). In five cells out of 49, no obvious local inputs were observed although distal inputs were present. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that while local GCs make a strong connection with PCs most of the time, exceptions may occur. Also, GCs located at several hundred micrometers from the recorded PC can make strong connections via their PFs, while neighboring patches can be silent, indicating that information originating in distant microzones can have a strong influence on a given PC."

Also, a single group of GCs is unlikely to influence a microzone by targeting a single PC. Therefore, if microzones communicate together via the PFs, PCs belonging to a given microzone should share several groups of functionally connected GCs from a distant microzone. We tested this hypothesis by recording pairs of neighboring PCs having the same zebrin identity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and determined their connectivity map. In the example shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, strong GC inputs were observed from local GCs, in P2<sup>+</sup> ipsilateral and in P2<sup>+</sup> contralateral bands in both PCs, while no or few significant inputs originated in the P1<sup>\u2212</sup> band.

Strikingly, the correlation matrix revealed four clusters of PC groups displaying a highly correlated GC connectivity map (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; clusters 1\u20134). Cluster identity was verified using a spectral co-clustering algorithm that simultaneously clusters rows and columns of a matrix without positional assumption (Materials and methods). The four clusters found were all centered on the diagonal line indicating that correlated PCs are neighbors. They are identified on the correlation matrix by dashed blue squares (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). These results strongly argue that PCs from different animals but at the same specific location in the mediolateral axis (i.e. the vermal part of lobule III/IV) have selected similar GC sites. Notably, none of these clusters clearly matches with a set of anatomical boundaries as illustrated by the comparison with zebrin II bands and MF inputs from the external cuneate and the spinal cord (green rectangles, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) indicating that boundaries of the functional organization between microzones differ from a pure anatomical description."

As for the four identified clusters of correlated PCs, no systematic link between GC hotspots and anatomical boundaries has been observed. However, it should be noted that for all PC groups, strong GC connections were always found in ipsilateral P2<sup>+</sup> while a large area of the P1<sup>\u2212</sup> band was silent. These findings showed that the highly heterogeneous patterns of GC connectivity are stereotyped and associated with four identified clusters of PCs, suggesting that a distinct functional organization linking distant regions might be superimposed on the anatomical microzonal framework."

We therefore tested whether GC connectivity patterns to GoCs and MLIs displayed similar spatial functional properties. GC inputs to GoCs were examined using GlyT2-EAAT4-GFP mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; Materials and methods). As opposed to PCs, patches of GCs connected to GoCs (n = 19 cells) were always found in the vicinity of the recorded cell. Within the mapped area, we found that 81% of GC synaptic inputs to GoCs were made by local GCs as assessed by the histogram of the median Z-score (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), for GoCs recorded in any of the four clusters of PCs identified (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since dendritic gap junctions might have shunted and filtered GC inputs located in distant apical GoC dendrites (<a href=\"#bib73\">Vervaeke et al., 2012</a>), potentially resulting in undetectable current at the soma, one subset of GoCs (n = 6) was recorded with the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (100 \u00b5M) in the bath. No differences were observed in these mappings, and all cells were pooled. The pattern of GC inputs was centered on GoCs with a mean extension of 114.1 \u00b1 70.1 \u00b5m, which falls within the average range of the reconstructed GoC axonal plexus (214 \u00b1 30 \u00b5m, n = 10; inset <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Neither the connectivity map nor the extension of the axonal plexus were limited by zebrin boundaries (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) as opposed to GoC apical dendrites (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sillitoe et al., 2008</a>). Thus, unlike GC inputs to PCs, excitatory inputs to a given GoC appear to be mostly restricted to GCs that can be targeted by the local axon of the same GoC, confirming that they implement a local inhibitory feedback circuit in the GC layer (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cesana et al., 2013</a>). Occasionally, small distal inputs were observed."

In MLIs, patterns of GC connectivity were measured using the number of events (expressed as a Z-score; Materials and methods) instead of the charge, as this measurement was less sensitive to background noise in this set of experiments. Similarly to GC-PC and GC-GoC connectivity, local GC inputs were identified. However, several patches of distant GC connections were also found in the histogram of the median Z-score of synaptic events (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; local peak, 80 \u00b5m from midline, two ipsilateral peaks, 195 \u00b5m and 320 \u00b5m from midline, and one contralateral peak, 135 \u00b5m from midline). Strikingly, some hotspots did not overlap perfectly with patches of GCs that elicit strong inputs in PCs from cluster 1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, see arrow and compare with PC from cluster 1 in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), indicating that for PCs and MLIs located in the same area, different groups of GC inputs can be selected.

                                "text": "Since the GC connectivity maps to PCs, MLIs and GoCs strictly match neither with the topography of the CF inputs nor with the boundaries of the MF projections, these heterogeneous and stereotyped functional maps might arise from a combination of the topographical organization of MF and CF projections and an activity-dependent synapse selection through long-term plasticity (<i>long</i>-<i>term</i> depression [<i>LTD]</i> and <i>long-term potentiation</i> [LTP]). In a set of PCs from cluster 1, we therefore tested whether GC connectivity maps could be altered by a protocol known to induce plasticity, either LTP or LTD (<a href=\"#bib16\">Coesmans et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hartell, 1996</a>). After producing a first series of GC input maps (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), we applied an electrical stimulation (1\u2009Hz stimulation/5\u2009min) to a large number of PFs in the molecular layer (mean evoked current in PCs = 1285 \u00b1 500\u2009pA, n = 12 which correspond to around 130 non-silent PFs; <a href=\"#bib38\">Isope and Barbour, 2002</a>), and resumed the mapping procedure for at least 15\u2009min. The initial averaged map was then compared site by site to the averaged updated map following stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6A-figure supplement 1</a>). After plasticity induction, 86 sites (22%; n = 8 cells) displayed a significant modification in synaptic charge (\u25b3Z-score &gt; 3.09 or &lt; \u22123.09; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6A-figure supplement 1</a>; Materials and methods), while no effect was observed in the remaining sites. As already observed, this protocol induced postsynaptic LTP (green squares, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Coesmans et al., 2004</a>) or LTD (blue squares, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hartell, 1996</a>) at the GC-PC synapse, indicating that we stimulated different PF beams converging on the recorded PC. All these changes were blocked by a combination of drugs that prevented the induction of plasticity (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A negative correlation was observed (slope 0.31 and r = 0.38) between the initial synaptic weight of the GC site (high Z-score) and the sign of the effect after induction, with stronger connections leading to LTD while weaker connections undergo LTP (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, selecting strong connections (Z-score &gt; 6.5) and determining the averaged time course for all these sites led to a mean depressed charge of 27% after plasticity induction. Conversely, of the 56 sites (14% of total sites) that were potentiated, 33 were silent in the initial map (white \u2018x\u2019 in green squares in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that previously undetectable synaptic connections were awakened and that the overall connectivity map can be modified by activity. Indeed, we compared the histograms of the median Z-score of charge of this set of PCs before and after plasticity induction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Although a few percent of the total number of PFs crossing the dendritic tree of the PCs had been stimulated, a new distant region, initially silent, became significantly connected to the PCs belonging to cluster 1, demonstrating that the connectivity map is adjustable (see * in the panel \u2018Difference\u2019 in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Therefore, functional microzones may communicate through the selection of GC-PC synapses in a specific set of PC clusters."

Hotspots were frequently observed at several hundred micrometers from the recorded PC or MLI. At first glance, these findings appear to be in contradiction with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib35\">Harvey and Napper, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Walter et al., 2009</a>). <a href=\"#bib80\">Walter et al. (2009)</a> demonstrated that GC inputs are evenly distributed in the mediolateral axis although local connections were slightly stronger. However, as patterns of GC inputs were aligned on PC somas, positional information could not be considered in this study. Indeed, removing the positional information from our dataset reproduced these findings (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that the identification of the organization of GC input patterns is position specific. Therefore, whether we define a microzone by the topography of the CF inputs or the combination of CF and MF inputs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), our results strongly argue that PFs communicate excitatory MF information between distant microzones. Because inhibition was blocked in our experiments, we have to acknowledge that the GC input patterns of connectivity described here do not describe the net excitatory/inhibitory balance affecting PC dendrites. However, although no prediction about PC discharges can be made, the GC connectivity map onto MLIs observed in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> suggests that PCs can be potentially inhibited by GCs from specific locations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Indeed, several studies demonstrated that feedforward inhibition participates in controlling the firing rate of PCs in individual microzones (<a href=\"#bib23\">Dizon and Khodakhah, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Santamaria et al., 2007</a>) and prevents the activation of distant PCs. Nonetheless, our data provide the first description of a conserved and predictable functional synaptic organization between one cortical layer \u2013 the granule cell layer \u2013 and the output stage of the cerebellar cortex \u2013 the Purkinje cell layer. The preferred organization of GC inputs to PCs and MLIs (in lobules III and IV of the anterior vermis) among different animals suggests that microzones may have specific roles in the context of the behavioral tasks associated with this cerebellar region, notably during adaptive locomotion (<a href=\"#bib3\">Apps and Garwicz, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dean et al., 2010</a>)."

There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy: (1) the different areas of the cerebellum studied (i.e. the C3 zone rather than medial lobules III and IV) might have specific operational rules. Indeed, other groups studying other regions of the cerebellar cortex have demonstrated that local GCs provide the majority of inputs for the underlying PCs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bower and Woolston, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cohen and Yarom, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Isope and Barbour, 2002</a>), for example in Crus I and II. Furthermore, in a recent in vivo study, while restricted patches of PC activation were observed in Crus II following forelimb stimulation, beam-like PC excitation elicited by PFs from distant GC inputs were identified in Crus I (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cramer et al., 2013</a>). (2) In vivo, the receptive fields were defined by modulation of the PC firing rate. This parameter could have been misleading since a null net effect could still have masked correlated modifications of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Notably, local GCs activate both PCs and MLIs in our experiments, suggesting that the resulting PC discharge is difficult to predict. In vivo, excitation or inhibition could be favored depending on the subset of GCs activated in a given context."

                                "text": "Because similar patterns of GC inputs to PCs, GoCs and MLIs were found in the different animals tested, a major issue was to assess whether this organization was the result of a genetically encoded developmental program or if it could be modified by activity. We demonstrated that PF stimulation could induce either LTD at individual sites (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hartell, 1996</a>) or LTP at individual sites (<a href=\"#bib16\">Coesmans et al., 2004</a>) indicating that activity-dependent processes can tune GC input maps. Such variability in the sign of the plasticity is due to the fact that the stimulation pipette sampled a limited set of PFs constituting a small proportion of the total number of PFs in the lobule, but belonging to many different GC patches. This explains why only 22% of GC patches were affected by plasticity. At the center of the stimulated PF beam, focal synaptic inputs to PC dendrites have likely evoked large calcium transients, similar to CF inputs (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hartell, 1996</a>), and thus induced LTD at these specific GC-PCs synapses. Focally evoked calcium transients could have been amplified at GC-PC synapses with a high synaptic weight, as stronger depolarization would have been elicited. Although focal stimulation in the molecular layer may appear non-physiological, a recent study demonstrated in vivo that sensory inputs can lead to clustered activation of PFs (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wilms and H\u00e4usser, 2015</a>). At the periphery of the stimulation beam, sparse activation of PFs might have induced moderate calcium transients leading to LTP (<a href=\"#bib16\">Coesmans et al., 2004</a>). Interestingly, new connections appeared systematically when we used a plasticity-inducing protocol at silent sites, demonstrating that quiescent synapses can be awakened following GC activation. These findings explain the appearance of a new peak of connected GCs in the median histogram of the Z-score of charges after plasticity induction. Indeed, plasticity occurred at almost every position in the mediolateral axis (see difference in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), but at silent sites a strong bias toward LTP was observed (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Because of the high efficiency of the stimulation protocol to awaken silent synapses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), a strong alteration of the GC connectivity map was likely to occur. Further experiments using specific MF stimulation will be required to assess whether such modifications in GC input maps are observed in physiological conditions. However, our results clearly demonstrate that the heterogeneity of the spatial map is an active process. These results are in agreement with previous in vivo\u00a0studies (<a href=\"#bib42\">J\u00f6rntell and Ekerot, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Schonewille et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Badura et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that distant microzones are associated through PFs by LTP mechanisms. LTP could favor information transfer between a set of GCs from one microzone and a group of PCs from another microzone. Conversely, LTD, which is physiologically induced by the conjunction of PF and CF inputs to PCs, could limit the communication between these microzones."

Notably, neither the PC clusters nor the GC spatial patterns of connections strictly match with the topography of the spinocerebellar or cuneate MF inputs carrying information from the hindlimb and forelimb, indicating that GC patches cannot simply be identified by the anatomical organization of a single source of MFs, and might combine MF information from different sources, as suggested in two recent studies (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chabrol et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Huang et al., 2013</a>; but see also <a href=\"#bib6\">Bengtsson and Jorntell, 2009</a>). Discrepancies between anatomical and functional boundaries have also been shown using in vivo calcium imaging of CF signaling in PCs following sensory stimulation (<a href=\"#bib71\">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</a>). Since P2<sup>+</sup> bands receive specific MF inputs from the hindlimb (<a href=\"#bib41\">J\u00f6rntell et al., 2000</a>), the functional organization observed in our experiments might illustrate the importance of connecting cortical microzones controlling similar muscles in both limbs."

We described here clusters of neighboring PCs and MLIs having similar GC input connectivity maps that might represent individual functional units. However, they differ from the original <i>anatomical microzone</i> definition as they can span multiple zebrin bands. Therefore, a <i>functional microzone</i> likely computes information from different sources of MF inputs and frequently belongs to two adjacent zebrin bands as also proposed by <a href=\"#bib32\">(Graham and Wylie, 2012)</a>. Since zebrin bands also define an array of biochemical markers that can have an important role in synaptic transmission, signal integration and plasticity (for example EAAT4 transporter, PLCbeta3 and 4, IP3R1 and mGluR1a receptors follow a specific zebrin pattern of expression) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cerminara et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hawkes, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Paukert et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</a>), a functional microzonal unit might then combine several toolboxes in order to process incoming information. In light of the stereotyped organization of GC input patterns to PCs and MLIs, and the local restriction of the GC inputs to GoCs, we postulate that the area between P2<sup>+</sup> ipsi- and contralateral bands could be composed of 10\u201313 functional units with a mean extension of 70\u2013100 \u00b5m, as already suggested by in vivo imaging studies (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ozden et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Schultz et al., 2009</a>). In the posterior lobe, zebrin bands and cerebellar inputs have a different topographical organization, notably in the vestibular lobules (<a href=\"#bib78\">Voogd, 2011</a>), but a modular system has also been described suggesting that the communication between microzones through PFs is a general mechanism involved in information processing in the cerebellum. However, whether conserved and stereotyped patterns across animals is the rule in the posterior lobe needs to be demonstrated. In Crus I/II, animal-specific processing linked to vibrissa tactile discrimination might lead to unique communication rules, as sensory discrimination relies on individual history."

Action potentials were blocked with tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 \u00b5M). Because of the thickness of the PC dendritic tree itself, direct stimulation of glutamate receptors yielded an upper limit for the size of the spot (half-width = 33.0 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b5m, n = 9). Since the lateral extension of GC dendrites could increase the responsive area, we also estimated this extent by recording GCs both in loose cell-attached mode (measuring evoked action potentials, the half-width of evoked action potentials was 45.5 \u00b1 10.9 \u00b5m, n = 7) and in whole-cell mode (measuring evoked currents, the half-width of direct stimulation was 59.6 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b5m, n = 7) while uncaging glutamate in10 \u00b5m steps (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). The average maximum number of evoked action potentials at the center of the spot was 19.6 \u00b1 6.6 (n = 7) indicating that even GC-PC connections with a very low probability of release could evoke a current to the recorded PCs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Isope and Barbour, 2002</a>).

They map connectivity of GCs to PCs using photo-uncaging of glutamate in discreet regions of the granule cell layer and find stereotyped but heterogeneous connectivity patterns. Contrary to previous findings, granule cell populations immediately subjacent to recorded Purkinje neurons were not necessarily stronger; indeed in some cases distal GC populations showed preferred connectivity. These maps, when viewed with respect to anatomical boundaries, appear to follow loose rules and show richer connectivity patterns that other cell types such as Golgi cells and molecular layer interneurons. Together the results suggest a previously unrecognized organization of connectivity between granule cells and Purkinje neurons and a point to a role for parallel fibers in cerebellar functional circuitry where before they have appeared functionally elusive."

It is therefore surprising that relatively little attention is paid to the role of inhibition in shaping GC-PC maps in the present study. Do the authors expect that the interesting heterogeneous patterns they uncovered here are robust to inhibition? Might inhibition further sculpt the patterns? How might the plane of section influence the findings (Rieubland et al. 2014)? While I think the results as presented are interesting on their own, without data on the maps with inhibition intact, it is difficult to surmise how relevant these maps are to normal physiological function of the cerebellum. At a very minimum these caveats should be more thoroughly discussed."

Yet the spatial map of GC connection probability in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> (and Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1) reveal that local GCs, in general, provide the strongest influence to overlying PCs. At first I scratched my head at this seemingly contradictory finding because the data shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a> clearly do not show strong local connectivity. Looking more closely at the <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> heat map, however, it is apparent that Purkinje neurons recorded in the P1<sup>\u2013</sup> zone were unique in lacking strong local GC input. Since these cells formed the basis of several figures as examples but are different from the overall trend in their weak local input, I think the authors should highlight this difference as a finding that is otherwise obscured by the predominant effect of local GC input on the maps and in the previously published literature."

Indeed, it would be important to provide some quantitative criterion for these pattern classes. Short of that they are descriptive but not rigorously defined."

I find their report to be convincing and important. They find that the synaptic strength of parallel fibers onto Purkinje neurons, as read out by postsynaptic currents, varies along the length of the fiber. Rather than systematic changes in strength, they find highly heterogeneous synapses that nevertheless produce stereotyped patterns of synaptic strength. These patterns do not correspond to known anatomical boundaries set up by zebrin stripes. At least 4 pattern groups exist and they cluster depending upon anatomical location. The patterns reflect experience because a plasticity induction protocol changes the synaptic strength pattern. Finally, these functional synaptic strength patterns differ for Golgi cells and MLIs. This study provides a glimpse into a hitherto unknown functional organizational pattern in cerebellar cortex dictated by activity-dependent mechanisms that will almost certainly play an important role in sculpting spatiotemporal patterns of Purkinje activity during behavior."

In the barrel cortex of rodents, initial suggestion that information from individual whiskers are processed mostly in one cortical column and combined at a later stage was largely broken by data demonstrating that intermodular communication can drive modular processing (see for example Estebanez et al., 2012 Nat Neurosci. 2012 Dec;15(12):1691-9.).

Although our observations are made in the cerebellar cortex, cell-specific connectivity profiles underlying inter-modular and intra modular information processing might be of general interest, since modular systems are present in many cortical structures. Therefore, we think that instead of being descriptive, our work provides the proof of concept for the activity dependent (as shown in the new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) selection of conserved sets of synapses that underlie modular communication. More specifically, our findings demonstrate that:"

By monitoring Purkinje cell discharge in vivo, several groups suggested that only local granule cells (through the ascending part of the granule cell axon) can drive Purkinje cells firing (see Bower and Woolston, J Neurophysiol. 1983 Mar;49(3):745-66; Cohen and Yarom, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Dec 8;95(25):15032-6.) indicating that information in the cerebellar cortex might be process in parallel and that coordination between microzones might occur at a downstream level, maybe outside the cerebellum. Conversely, other groups suggested that Purkinje cells are only driven by one restricted group of granule cells, but not local (for review Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010 Jan;11(1):30-43.). However, studies performed in vivo, monitored the discharge of the Purkinje cells following stimulation of cerebellar inputs, a very indirect assessment of granule cell-Purkinje cell functional organization. Ultimately, based on in vitro uncaging techniques, another group suggested that granule cells give a broad input onto Purkinje cells (Walter et al., 2009 J Neurosci. 2009 Jul 1;29(26):8462-73.). However, they did not consider the location of the recordings in their study, smoothing heterogeneities."

The manuscript could be strengthened to better articulate the findings, justify certain analytical approaches, clarify figures, and more thoroughly address the discrepancies with previous findings. These ideas are fleshed out below: 1) Previous studies have identified a role for molecular layer interneurons in inhibiting distant Purkinje neurons through a lateral inhibition mechanism (Dizon &amp; Khodakhah, 2011). It is therefore surprising that relatively little attention is paid to the role of inhibition in shaping GC-PC maps in the present study. Do the authors expect that the interesting heterogeneous patterns they uncovered here are robust to inhibition? Might inhibition further sculpt the patterns? How might the plane of section influence the findings (Rieubland et al. 2014)? While I think the results as presented are interesting on their own, without data on the maps with inhibition intact, it is difficult to surmise how relevant these maps are to normal physiological function of the cerebellum. At a very minimum these caveats should be more thoroughly discussed.</i> "

However, it is important to keep in mind that inhibition won't change in any way the structure of the granule input maps that we have described here, which are only excitatory connection maps. We also would like to insist on the fact that distant granule cells hardly contact local Golgi cells and that the axon of Golgi cells is restricted to the local area. Consequently, feedback inhibition is restricted to local area which will affect only local granule cells. The excitatory communication lines described here between microzones are thus physiologically relevant even if the final effect on Purkinje cell discharge is ultimately linked to the balance between direct excitation from granule cells and disynaptic inhibition from molecular layer interneurons."

In the matrix, the median pattern of groups of PCs in a 100 \u00b5m window has been correlated. Since two adjacent groups are separated by only 10 \u00b5m, they share some patterns. Therefore, several lines of the matrix are necessary to separate different profiles. For this reason, clusters based only on the correlation matrix are larger, explaining the extensions from the result of the biclustering algorithm. Regarding the 5th cluster, because it is situated at the edge of the field (&gt;300 \u00b5m from the midline), it contains fewer patterns and has not been detected by the biclustering algorithm."

It has been shown by Gerrits and Voogd that the MFs in particularly the anterior lobe are organized in zones, whereas those in the posterior lobe are not. The patterns of MF projections in the posterior lobe are dramatically different from those in the anterior lobe.</i> "

However, anatomical evidences suggest that a microzonal organization can also be observed in the posterior lobe. This has been reviewed for example by Jan Voogd several times (Voogd, J. (2014). Front. Syst. Neurosci. <i>8</i>, 1\u201314.). The group of Richard Apps also described the organization of discrete modules in the posterior lobe (Cerminara, N.L., Aoki, H., Loft, M., Sugihara, I., and Apps, R. (2013). J. Neurosci. <i>33</i>, 16427\u201316442.). Matsuo Matsushita showed that mossy fibers can project in bands in lobule VIII (Figures 14-15 of Yaginuma and Matsushita J Comp Neurol. 1987 Apr 1;258(1):1-27). Interestingly mossy fibers projecting to anterior lobule III/IV make collaterals to posterior lobule VIII suggesting that common mechanisms may apply to this lobule (Voogd, J., Pardoe, J., Ruigrok, T.J.H., and Apps, R. (2003). J. Neurosci. <i>23</i>, 4645\u20134656). Although anatomical differences are obvious, we suggest that communication between microzones through PFs could be a general mechanism involved in information processing in the cerebellum."

For example, in crus I/II, it is possible that animal specific processing linked to vibrissa tactile discrimination leads to unique communication rules, as sensory discrimination relies on individual history."
