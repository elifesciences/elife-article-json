Using <i>Aspergillus nidulans,</i> we show that AP-2 has a clathrin-independent essential role in polarity maintenance and growth. This is in line with a sequence analysis showing that the AP-2 \u03b2 subunit (\u03b22) of higher fungi lacks a clathrin-binding domain, and experiments showing that AP-2 does not co-localize with clathrin. We provide genetic and cellular evidence that AP-2 interacts with endocytic markers SlaB<sup>End4</sup> and SagA<sup>End3</sup> and the lipid flippases DnfA and DnfB in the sub-apical collar region of hyphae. The role of AP-2 in the maintenance of proper apical membrane lipid and cell wall composition is further supported by its functional interaction with BasA (sphingolipid biosynthesis) and StoA (apical sterol-rich membrane domains), and its essentiality in polar deposition of chitin. Our findings support that the AP-2 complex of dikarya has acquired, in the course of evolution, a specialized clathrin-independent function necessary for fungal polar growth."

Using <i>Aspergillus nidulans,</i> we show that AP-2 has a clathrin-independent essential role in polarity maintenance and growth. This is in line with a sequence analysis showing that the AP-2 \u03b2 subunit (\u03b22) of higher fungi lacks a clathrin-binding domain, and experiments showing that AP-2 does not co-localize with clathrin. We provide genetic and cellular evidence that AP-2 interacts with endocytic markers SlaB<sup>End4</sup> and SagA<sup>End3</sup> and the lipid flippases DnfA and DnfB in the sub-apical collar region of hyphae. The role of AP-2 in the maintenance of proper apical membrane lipid and cell wall composition is further supported by its functional interaction with BasA (sphingolipid biosynthesis) and StoA (apical sterol-rich membrane domains), and its essentiality in polar deposition of chitin. Our findings support that the AP-2 complex of dikarya has acquired, in the course of evolution, a specialized clathrin-independent function necessary for fungal polar growth."

AP-1 is necessary for the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles that traffic between the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network (TGN) and early endosomes. AP-2 is involved in the formation of clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane (PM). AP-3 is involved in, apparently, clathrin-independent vesicle formation in the Golgi for traffic to endosomes and lysosomes or vacuoles. AP-4 and AP-5 seem to have more specialized roles in vesicle transport of specific cargoes from the TGN to endosomes and/or the cell surface\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib30\">Hirst et al., 2013</a>). All AP complexes are composed of two different subunits of high molecular weight\u00a0~100 kDa (called \u03b1, \u03b2 or \u03b3 adaptins), one subunit of medium size (\u03bc, 47\u201350 kDa), and one low-molecular-weight subunit (\u03c3, 17\u201319 kDa). The five AP complexes have been shown to have a wide eukaryote distribution, supporting that all were present in the Last Eukaryote Common Ancestor (LECA) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barlow et al., 2014</a>). Noticeably, however, each AP complex, except AP-1, has been lost in various lineages. Fungi possess homologues of all AP-1, AP-2 and AP-3 subunits, but the great majority of them, have lost AP-4 and AP-5. This loss concerns all Dikarya (Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes) and most primitive fungi. AP-4 or AP-5 subunits are however present in the glomeromycete <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> and chytrid fungi <i>Spizellomyces punctatus</i> and <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>, as well as, the sister group of all fungi, <i>Fonticula alba.</i> Notably, all eukaryotes studied possess clathrin, except for\u00a0the Microsporidia intracellular parasites. Interestingly, the microsporidian <i>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</i> maintains AP subunits without having clathrin (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barlow et al., 2014</a>), suggesting an unknown clathrin-independent role of AP complexes."

                        "text": "The role of the AP-2 complex in clathrin-mediated endocytosis is well established in mammals. By contrast, its role in endocytosis in unicellular eukaryotes, such as the yeasts <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i> has been questioned. An early systematic biochemical and genetic characterization of AP complexes in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> provided evidence that AP complexes are dispensable for clathrin function (<a href=\"#bib92\">Yeung et al., 1999</a>). Similarly, <a href=\"#bib31\">Huang et al. (1999)</a> have shown that AP deletion strains did not display the phenotypes associated with clathrin deficiency, including slowed growth and endocytosis, defective late Golgi protein retention and impaired cytosol to vacuole/autophagy function. Subsequently however, AP-2 has been localized to endocytic sites that are associated with clathrin, and have a cargo-specific function in killer toxin K28 endocytosis, making it likely that AP-2 functions with clathrin (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carroll et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2012</a>). Furthermore, AP-2 has been shown to be critical for hyphal growth in <i>C. albicans</i> and polarized cell responses in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, and in particular to be necessary for relocalization of the cell wall stress sensor Mid2 to the tip of a mating projection following pheromone addition (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chapa-y-Lazo et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, an interaction between the mu (\u03bc) subunit of AP-2 and the cell wall integrity pathway component Pkc1\u00a0was reported to affect recruitment of the AP-2 complex to endocytic sites (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chapa-y-Lazo and Ayscough, 2014</a>). In another systematic screen to identify proteins required for cargo internalization, clathrin was shown to have a critical role for synaptobrevin homologue Snc1 endocytosis, but the role of AP-2 was not investigated (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burston et al., 2009</a>). In a more recent study it has been shown that clathrin contributes to the regularity of vesicle scission and vesicle size, but is not required for elongating or shaping the endocytic membrane invagination, but again the role of AP-2 was not studied (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kukulski et al., 2016</a>). Finally, in <i>S. pombe</i>, the AP-2 \u03b1 component (Apl3p) was shown to interact physically with clathrin light chain (Clc1p), and genetically with both Clc1p and the endocytic factor Sla2p and additionally <i>apl3\u0394</i> null mutants showed altered dynamics of endocytic sites associated with abnormal cell wall synthesis and morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">de Le\u00f3n et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">de Le\u00f3n and Valdivieso, 2016</a>)."

In contrast to yeasts, the extreme polar growth of filamentous fungi, taking place by apical extension, is absolutely dependent on efficient and continuous endocytosis. Seminal studies on endocytosis and its relationship to growth have been performed in the basidiomycete <i>Ustilago maydis</i> (<a href=\"#bib80\">Steinberg, 2014</a>) and the ascomycete <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i> (<a href=\"#bib64\">Pe\u00f1alva, 2010</a>), two emerging cell biology model systems."

The first relates to the essential role of apical endocytosis in hyphal tube extension and polar growth (<a href=\"#bib3\">Araujo-Baz\u00e1n et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Taheri-Talesh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hervas-Aguilar and Penalva, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Pe\u00f1alva, 2010</a>). It has been rigorously shown that polar growth maintenance is based on the spatial and functional coupling of rapid and continuous apical secretion and endocytosis in the hyphal tip region. Apically localized cargoes, as exemplified by the v-SNARE synaptobrevin homologue SynA, are internalized from a \u2018collar\u2019 region immediately below the hyphal tip and sorted in early endosomes (EEs). EEs can mature into Late Endosomes (LE) or Multivesicular Bodies (MVB) and be sorted into vacuoles, or recycle back, apparently via the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network (TGN) onto the PM. These post-endocytic trafficking processes taking place at the hyphal tips seem to be essential for the normal rate of secretion and proper growth. SlaB<sup>End4</sup> and actin polymerization are major factors for apical endocytosis."

Unlike endocytosis related to apical cargoes taking place mostly at hyphal tips, transporter internalization takes place homogenously all along the hyphal membrane and necessitates cargo ubiquitination. Transporter ubiquitination requires a group of cargo-specific \u03b1-arrestin like proteins, acting as adaptors of the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase HulA<sup>Rsp5</sup>. Transporter ubiquitination is followed by internalization and sorting into EEs and the MVB/vacuolar pathway for terminal degradation. Transporter internalization, similar to apical endocytosis, requires actin polymerization and functional endocytic factors SagA<sup>End3</sup> or SlaB<sup>End4</sup>."

This report showed that ClaH is localized mostly in\u00a0late (<i>trans</i>) Golgi and secondarily to tentative endocytic sites, and although absolutely essential for growth, it does not seem to be involved in endocytosis. The later conclusion was, however, solely supported by studies concerning the internalization of the FM4-64 lipophilic marker, rather than specific endocytic cargoes.

The conclusion from this thorough study was that all fungi possess AP-1, AP-2 or AP-3 subunits, but most, and apparently all Dikarya, have lost AP-4 or AP-5. Given our interest on the role of AP1-3 complexes in membrane traffic and particularly of AP-2 in endocytosis in <i>A. nidulans</i>, we carried out a similar analysis with particular emphasis on <i>Aspergillus</i> species. <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> shows that all Aspergilli possess highly similar homologous AP1-3 subunits, which can be unambiguously assigned into the distinct AP complexes. <i>Aspergillu</i>s AP subunits are also phylogenetically highly related to homologues from all major fungal groups, as well as, selected model organisms (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Importantly, AP subunits of a given complex are more similar to those of the orthologous complex in distantly related species, than to subunits of other AP complexes of the same species, in line with the acquisition of different functional roles of AP-1,\u20132 or \u22123 complexes in cargo membrane traffic."

                                "text": "A major and somehow surprising finding concerning the \u03b2 subunits of not only <i>Aspergillus</i> species, but most fungi (all dikarya) came from the sequence analyses we performed. We observed that the \u03b2 subunits of all three AP complexes do not contain the C-terminal part, of approximately 332 amino acid residues, which however is present in some primitive fungi, such as the chytrids <i>Rozella allomycis</i>, <i>Allomyces macrogynus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>, <i>Spizellomycetales punctatus</i> and <i>Macrophomina phaseolina</i> and in the fungal sister group <i>Fonticula alba</i> (all sharing 35\u201340% identity with human \u03b2 subunits) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The C-terminal domain of the \u03b2 subunit is conserved in several Amoebozoa (25\u201336% identity), Rhizaria (31% identity), Alveolata (29% identity in <i>Plasmodium</i> or <i>Toxoplasma</i> species), Choanoflagellates (34\u201344% identity), Mesomycetozoea (44\u201350% identity), Algae (30% identity), and in the great majority of plants (38% identity) and Metazoa (58\u201360% identity) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and data not shown). Some prominent losses, except fungi, were identified in <i>Trypanosoma</i> and <i>Leishmania</i> species and in Excavata. Importantly, the lost part corresponds to an essential part of \u03b2 appendage, which includes two C-terminal domains (pfam02883 and pfam09066) involved in clathrin binding and polymerization, and consequently necessary for the translocation of endocytic accessory proteins to a membrane bud site (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mousavi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lemmon and Traub, 2012</a>). A hydrophobic patch present in the lost domain also binds to a subset of D\u03a6[F/W] motif-containing proteins that are bound by the alpha-adaptin appendage domain (epsin, AP180) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lemmon and Traub, 2012</a>). Thus, fungal AP complexes might be incapable of interacting, at least via a \u2018canonical\u2019 association, with clathrin. Microsporidia, which are probably the only known eukaryotes lacking clathrin, also lack the clathrin binding domains in their AP complexes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barlow et al., 2014</a>). A major prediction from these observations is that, in fungi, clathrin-dependent processes, such as endocytosis and vesicle budding, might be AP-complex independent, while any role of the AP complexes might in turn be clathrin-independent. Obviously this prediction does not exclude that AP-2 or AP-1 complexes might still have the potential to interact with clathrin through unknown binding sequences in the \u03b2 subunit or domains in other subunits, as for example reported for AP-1 in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib91\">Yeung and Payne, 2001</a>). However, subsequent experimental evidence presented herein strongly support a clathrin-independent role of AP-2 in <i>A. nidulans</i> polar growth."

Genetic disruption of the \u03c3 subunits, similarly to disruption of any of the four AP subunits, has been reported to inactivate the function of the full adaptor complex (<a href=\"#bib69\">Robinson, 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib70\">2015</a>).

                                "text": "We investigated the role of the AP complexes on membrane cargo traffic and endocytosis by following the subcellular localization of a GFP-tagged transporter, namely UapA. UapA is an extensively studied uric acid-xanthine/H<sup>+</sup> symporter, which has been used as a model cargo for studying the regulation of exocytosis and endocytosis of polytopic membrane proteins in <i>A. nidulans</i> (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pantazopoulou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gournas et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Karachaliou et al., 2013</a>). After synthesis and translocation in the ER, fully functional GFP-tagged UapA molecules follow a vesicular secretion pathway to localize homogenously and stably in the PM of hyphal cells. However, UapA molecules undergo ubiquitylation-dependent endocytosis and vacuolar degradation in response to substrate excess or to the presence of rich nitrogen sources (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or glutamine). This picture remained unaffected when we followed the subcellular localization of UapA-GFP in isogenic <i>thiA<sub>p</sub>-ap1<sup>\u03c3</sup>, ap2<sup>\u03c3</sup></i>\u0394 or <i>ap3<sup>\u03c3</sup></i>\u0394 mutant backgrounds (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The same picture is obtained under conditions of de novo or continuous UapA-GFP synthesis, or when signals triggering endocytosis are imposed after repression of UapA-GFP synthesis (data not shown). The non-essentiality of the AP-1 and AP-3 complexes in UapA traffic was somehow expected, because transporter exocytosis occurs by direct fusion of post-Golgi vesicles with the PM, and seemingly does not involve sorting from the\u00a0Golgi to the endosomal compartment. However, the dispensability of AP-2, an adaptor involved in the formation of endocytic vesicles in other systems, for UapA-GFP endocytosis was somehow unexpected and contrasted the picture observed in standard endocytic mutants (<i>sagA\u0394</i> or <i>thiA<sub>p</sub>-slaB</i>), where UapA internalization from the PM was totally blocked (see right panels in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for the construction of\u00a0<i>thiA<sub>p</sub>-slaB</i>). The non-involvement of AP-2 in UapA endocytosis was further confirmed by time-lapse experiments, performed in the <i>ap2<sup>\u03c3</sup></i>\u0394 mutant strain and an isogenic wild-type control (<i>ap2<sup>\u03c3+</sup></i>), which showed that UapA-GFP internalization initiates at 15 min and becomes more prominent 20\u201330 min after NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> addition in both strains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

Firstly, we tested whether the endocytosis of other evolutionary, structurally and functionally distinct transporters is also AP-2 independent. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,E and F</a> show that this is indeed the case, as all six transporters tested are internalized with the same efficiency and rate, in both <i>ap2<sup>\u03c3</sup></i>\u0394 and <i>ap2<sup>\u03c3+</sup></i> backgrounds, in response to endocytic signals (<a href=\"#bib85\">Tavoularis et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Vlanti and Diallinas, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Apostolaki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Krypotou et al., 2015</a>). Noticeably, different transporters exhibit different stabilities and endocytic \u2018sensitivities\u2019, but as quantification confirmed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E and F</a>), in all cases AP-2 proved dispensable for their proper internalization rate and turnover. We also examined whether the genetic elimination of a different AP-2 subunit, other than \u03c32, also leads to similar results in respect to transporter endocytosis. We deleted the gene encoding the \u03bc2 subunit of the AP-2 complex, and subsequently constructed <i>ap2<sup>\u03c3</sup></i>\u0394 <i>ap2<sup>\u03bc</sup></i>\u0394 double mutants and strains expressing UapA-GFP in the <i>ap2<sup>\u03bc</sup></i>\u0394\u00a0background. The <i>ap2<sup>\u03c3</sup></i>\u0394<i>, ap2<sup>\u03bc</sup></i>\u0394 and <i>ap2<sup>\u03c3</sup></i>\u0394 <i>ap2<sup>\u03bc</sup></i>\u0394 mutants had identical phenotypes, characterized by loss of polarity maintenance and poor growth rate (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). UapA-GFP endocytosis operated normally in the <i>ap2<sup>\u03bc</sup></i>\u0394\u00a0background, similar to what was observed in the <i>ap2<sup>\u03c3</sup></i>\u0394\u00a0or wild-type isogenic backgrounds (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Overall, these results confirmed that AP-2 is dispensable for transporter endocytosis."

To investigate the role of clathrin in these processes, we constructed relevant null or conditional mutants of the heavy (ClaH) and light (ClaL) chains of clathrin. The ClaH null mutant (<i>claH</i>) was not viable as it could only be rescued in heterokaryotic transformants (<a href=\"#bib56\">Osmani et al., 2006</a>). The ClaL null mutant (<i>claL</i>) was viable, but severely affected in growth (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The corresponding conditional mutants were based on the use of the highly repressible <i>thiA<sub>p</sub></i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib2\">Apostolaki et al., 2012</a>). In the absence of thiamine (repressor), strains expressing <i>thiA<sub>p</sub>-claH</i> or <i>thiA<sub>p</sub>-claL</i> grew similar to wild-type isogenic control strains (not shown), whereas in the presence of thiamine <i>thiA<sub>p</sub>-claH</i> did not grow to form colonies, while <i>thiA<sub>p</sub>-claL</i> formed very small compact colonies, compatible with a severe growth defect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). <a href=\"#bib73\">Schultzhaus et al. (2017b)</a>, recently reported very similar growth phenotypes. We further examined the thiamine-repressible mutants under the microscope (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The <i>thiA<sub>p</sub>-claL</i> strain showed normal hyphae morphology and polar growth in the absence of thiamine, but prominent hypha tip swelling under <i>ab initio</i> repression of ClaL, that is, in the continuous presence of thiamine, especially at 37\u00b0C. This phenotype, which was confirmed by quantification (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013E</a>), might be associated with genetic blocks in apical endocytosis of specific cargoes. Knock-down of ClaL did not however modify the polar depositioning of calcofluor staining, which suggests\u00a0normal chitin synthesis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Higuchi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Takeshita et al., 2012</a>), and neither affected polarity maintenance. The <i>thiA<sub>p</sub>-claH</i> strain also showed normal hyphae morphology and polar growth in the absence of thiamine, but contrastingly, hyphae morphology was severely affected\u00a0in the continuous presence of thiamine, becoming flattened and often showing swelling of tips or conidiospore heads, or becoming thinner and smaller in overall size, an indication of progressive lethality (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and F</a>). Still however, polarity maintenance was preserved when ClaH was repressed. Thus, in no case the phenotypes resulting from the absence of clathrin, either ClaH or ClaL, resembled those obtained in the absence of AP-2."

More specifically, in the latter case, when thiamine was added from the beginning of growth, UapA-GFP showed a rather diffuse\u00a0and cytoplasmic appearance, instead of the normal cortical marking of the PM (notice the magnified area in the relevant insert in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>).

This leads to apparent Golgi and endosome collapse and progressive lethality, which could easily explain why we detect UapA-GFP in cytosolic structures, rather than in the PM.

For this, we directly tested whether 5 or 10 hr repression of <i>claH\u00a0via</i> the <i>thiA</i> promoter is sufficient for depleting ClaH, by performing and quantifying immunoblot assays using anti-GFP or anti-actin antibodies against total protein extracts from a strain expressing ClaH-GFP.

Based on these immunoblots, we examined the effect of ClaH on UapA-GFP endocytosis by using at least a 10 hr period of <i>claH</i> repression, after pre-secretion of UapA-GFP into the PM. In this case, a significant fraction of UapA-GFP remained PM-associated despite the appearance of UapA-specific cytoplasmic structures and increased vacuolar degradation, which are however expected outcomes resulting from a block in Golgi functioning and transporter secretion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, extreme right panel)."

Additionally, no significant co-localization of Ap2<sup>\u03c3</sup>-GFP was obtained with a marker of the TGN (PH<sup>OSBP</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

This constitutes good evidence that\u00a0GFP- or RFP-tagged versions of ClaL are functional.

The apparent prominent localization of ClaL in Golgi-like structures is in full agreement with results in <a href=\"#bib73\">Schultzhaus et al.

StoA is a stomatin homologue involved in the maintenance of apical sterol-rich membrane domains (SRDs) and polarity in <i>A. nidulans</i> (<a href=\"#bib83\">Takeshita et al., 2012</a>). In metazoa, stomatins are oligomeric, lipid raft-associated proteins with scaffolding functions necessary for the maintenance of specific lipid composition in membranes, but their molecular function is still unclear (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lapatsina et al., 2012</a>). BasA\u00a0is required for phytosphingosine biosynthesis and is essential for fungal viability. A previously reported thermosensitive missense mutation in <i>basA</i> (<i>basA1</i>) resulted in an\u00a0aberrant cell wall thickening and growth arrest at 42\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib42\">Li et al., 2007</a>). For the present work, we used null mutants of SagA (<a href=\"#bib32\">Karachaliou et al., 2013</a>), DnfA, DnfB (<a href=\"#bib75\">Schultzhaus et al., 2015</a>) and StoA (<a href=\"#bib83\">Takeshita et al., 2012</a>), and either <i>basA1</i> or a conditional knock-down mutant of <i>basA</i>, constructed herein using the <i>thiA<sub>p</sub></i> promoter. These mutants were all crossed with the <i>ap2<sup>\u03c3</sup></i>\u0394 strain. Growth phenotypes of the resulting double mutants compared to single mutants are shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and D</a>. In all cases, double mutants showed reduced growth compared to single mutants (that\u00a0is, synthetic negative phenotypes), strongly suggesting that the function of AP-2 is related to that of SagA, DnfA and DnfB, as expected based on the subcellular localization experiments, but also to StoA and BasA. Microscopic examination of the morphology of the mutants confirmed that the defects in AP-2 and SagA, DnfA, DnfB, StoA or BasA were additive (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C and E</a>). Finally, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a> shows that the localization of AP-2<sup>\u03c3</sup>-GFP in a <i>basA1</i> genetic background is not anymore in the collar region, but instead marks internal structures just behind the tip. All above observations were confirmed by relevant quantitative analysis, as shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G and H</a>."

The appendage of the \u03b22 subunit specifically interacts with clathrin (<a href=\"#bib33\">Keyel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Thieman et al., 2009</a>). Lower eukaryotes, like free living filamentous fungi, face the challenge of rapid and polarized growth via apical extension, a process that is absolutely dependent on efficient endocytosis and recycling of chaperones and enzymes, related to PM and cell wall deposition at the growing tip (<a href=\"#bib64\">Pe\u00f1alva, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Pe\u00f1alva et al., 2012</a>). Fungi also need both basal and conditionally elicited endocytosis all along their hyphal PM, serving the renewal or modification of membrane components in response to changing nutritional or stress conditions, best exemplified by the endocytic turnover of transporters (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gournas et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Karachaliou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Diallinas, 2014</a>).

In parallel, we showed that clathrin (both ClaH and ClaL) is also essential for <i>A. nidulans</i> growth and that ClaH has a critical role in Golgi function and cargo secretion, which is probably the main reason why the ClaH null mutation is lethal. The importance of ClaH in conventional secretion via the Golgi was also recently reported by <a href=\"#bib73\">Schultzhaus et al. (2017b)</a>. An essential role of clathrin in the endocytosis of transporters is also well supported by our results. Importantly, we also showed that the function of ClaL is unrelated to polarity maintenance or the polar localization of lipid or cell wall- related apical cargoes, which contrasts its essential role in transporter endocytosis. Our results also supported that the effect of ClaH depletion in maintaining the polar localization of apical cargoes is due to malfunctioning of Golgi-dependent secretion, rather than a direct effect on the\u00a0polar localization establishment, similarly to what is observed when BFA is added to growing cells. These results, together with the absence of any significant overlap in the PM localization of clathrin and AP-2, and the distinct phenotypes of clathrin and AP-2 mutants, confirmed that clathrin and AP-2 are recruited in distinct, cargo-dependent, trafficking pathways."

We thus showed that AP-2 co-localizes apically with endocytic factors SlaB and SagA at sites of actin polymerization in the sub-apical collar region. Subsequently, we provided direct evidence that AP-2 has a role on the apical localization and function of DnfA and DnfB flippases, and affects ergosterol (filipin) and cell wall (calcofluor) deposition at the tip. We finally showed that AP-2 interacts functionally with other proteins involved in apical lipid maintenance and scaffolding (BasA and StoA). The key role of AP-2 in apical endocytosis is in line with previous results showing that proper membrane lipid and cell wall composition is essential for fungal polar growth (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheng et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Takeshita et al., 2012</a>).

Endocytic vesicles are sorted in the Early Endosomes (EEs) and from there DnfA and DnfB undergo retrograde traffic to the TGN, the Spitzenk\u00f6rper (a vesicle sorting region in filamentous ascomycetes; <a href=\"#bib60\">Pantazopoulou et al., 2014</a>) and eventually reach the PM (<a href=\"#bib75\">Schultzhaus et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Pe\u00f1alva, 2015</a>). Extrapolating from the observation that AP-1 loss-of-function mutants are severely defective in polarity maintenance and growth, similar to AP-2 mutants, we predict that AP-1 is involved in the retrograde exocytosis (green arrows) of DnfA, DnfB and other cargoes essential for lipid or cell wall (for\u00a0example, chitin synthases) maintenance. The model does not exclude that a fraction of DnfA and DnfB and other cargoes endocytosed by the AP-2 pathway would undergo degradation after being sorted into degradative EEs that are destined to the vacuole. The model also depicts that transporters and possibly other non-polar membrane proteins are not cargoes of the AP-2 pathway, but instead undergo clathrin- and \u03b1-arrestin-dependent endocytosis, followed by sorting into degradative EEs and eventual degradation in the vacuole (Vac). The model also suggests that SlaB and SagA endocytic factors might have roles in both the AP-2 and clathrin endocytic pathways. Finally, the model shows that SynA (V-Snare) is not a cargo of the AP-2 pathway. The roles of some other factors in exocytosis (Sec4, Rab11, Rab1, Rab6 and RabE) or sorting (RabB) of cargoes, is based on the work of the group of M.A. Pe\u00f1alva (<a href=\"#bib63\">Pe\u00f1alva, 2015</a>)."

To our knowledge, however, the opposite is a novel finding, as no other report has shown a major clathrin-independent role of the AP-2 complex. A role, albeit minor, for AP-2 in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) proteins and beta1 integrin is the only reported case of a clathrin-independent role of AP-2 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lau and Chou, 2008</a>). Interestingly, Microsporidia possess AP complexes, but not clathrin, which further shows that AP complexes can function without clathrin. The fact that no canonical clathrin binding domains were identified in the \u03b21 and \u03b22 subunits of primitive fungi supports the notion that Dikarya have lost clathrin-binding domains during their evolution. The experimental support of a clathrin-independent role of AP-2 in endocytosis was in good agreement with the in silico observation that the \u03b22 subunit of AP-2 of all higher fungi lacks the entire C-terminal \u03b2 appendage, which includes known clathrin binding domains. Interestingly, clathrin binding domains are also missing from the AP-1 \u03b2 subunit (\u03b21) of all Dikarya, suggesting that in fungi AP-1 might also function independently of clathrin, very probably being involved in the recycling via the TGN compartment of specific apical proteins. Thus AP-2 and AP-1 might function in the same pathway for apical cargo recycling. Interestingly, AP-1 has been reported to function independently of clathrin in phagocytosis in murine macrophages (<a href=\"#bib7\">Braun et al., 2007</a>). This has been correlated with the presence of two isoforms of the \u03b3-adaptin subunit of AP-1 in macrophages (<a href=\"#bib72\">Santambrogio et al., 2005</a>), and it has been proposed that the cleaved form of AP-1 is the one associated with vesicles present under phagocytic cups (<a href=\"#bib7\">Braun et al., 2007</a>)."

In a recent report, <a href=\"#bib5\">Bitsikas et al. (2014)</a>, provided evidence that clathrin-independent pathways do not, in fact, contribute significantly to endocytic flux. However, in cases where it has been supported experimentally, CIE seems to be specialized for the\u00a0maintenance of PM lipid composition (<a href=\"#bib78\">Shvets et al., 2015</a>) and the endocytosis of proteins anchored to the membrane by glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nichols, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bitsikas et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, in some cases CIE has also been reported to depend on specific PM lipid rafts and/or microdomains, such as caveolae or flotillins (<a href=\"#bib24\">Glebov et al., 2006</a>), despite some recent contradicting reports supporting that caveolae and flotillins function in organizing PM domains, rather being <i>bona fide</i> endocytic factors (<a href=\"#bib61\">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</a>). Finally, some CIE pathways also depend on dynamin (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lamaze et al., 2001</a>). An apparent conclusion from the above and other studies is that distinctions and variations in both clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CME) or CIE seem to arise from the endocytic cargo being examined (<a href=\"#bib45\">Maldonado-B\u00e1ez et al., 2013</a>).

In addition, a CIE pathway was discovered in <i>Candida albicans</i> (<a href=\"#bib21\">Epp et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, in yeast, \u03b1-arrestins are important for cargo selection in both the CME and CIE, but seem to function by distinct mechanisms in each pathway, as in the CIE pathway, unlike CME, their function is independent of the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Nikko et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Prosser et al., 2015</a>). Although the involvement of AP-2 in CIE in yeast has not been examined, the involvement of \u03b1-arrestins differentiates it from the apical CIE pathway we identify herein, as none of the <i>A. nidulans</i> arrestin knock-out mutants shows defects in polarity maintenance and growth (<a href=\"#bib32\">Karachaliou et al., 2013</a>). This however does not exclude the possibility that the apical CIE pathway in <i>A. nidulans</i> shares other factors of the CIE pathway identified in yeast (for\u00a0example, Rho1, Rom1/2 or formin Bni1). In fact, SepA (orthologue of Bni1; <a href=\"#bib27\">Harris et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Sharpless and Harris, 2002</a>), is necessary for septum formation and polarity maintenance, and RhoA<sup>Rho1</sup> plays a role in polarity, proper branching pattern, and cell wall deposition (<a href=\"#bib26\">Guest et al., 2004</a>), phenotypes related to the proposed AP-2 function."

From the evolutionary point of view, our work suggests that in higher fungi the function of the AP-2 complex has been uncoupled, probably via a specific gene truncation, from clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and that this uncoupling seems to serve specific cellular challenges of fungal polar growth."

FM4-64 and CMAC staining was according to <a href=\"#bib63\">Pe\u00f1alva (2015)</a> and <a href=\"#bib22\">Evangelinos et al. (2016)</a>, respectively. Brefeldin A was used at a final concentration of 100 \u03bcg ml<sup>\u22121</sup>. Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1/Axio Cam HR R3 camera. Contrast adjustment, area selection and color combining were made using the Zen lite 2012 software. Live imaging of plasma membrane ClaL was accomplished by TIRF-M. Hyphae were analyzed using a Leica AM TIRF MC set up on a Leica DMI6000 B microscope and a Leica 100X HCX PL APO 1.4 NA objective. Biological replicates correspond to different samples, while technical replicates correspond to different hyphae observed and/or photographed within each sample.

In a bioinformatics analysis, they show that the \u03b2 subunit of AP-2 of <i>A. nidulans</i>, as well as of other fungi, does not contain the C-terminal domain with the clathrin-binding site. They then investigate the role of AP-2 in <i>A. nidulans</i> endocytosis, and find that it is critical for polarized growth, but not for endocytosis of various plasma membrane-resident transporters; it has been known before that clathrin-mediated endocytosis does not necessarily require AP-2. However, they then show that polar localization of particular cargo requires AP-2 but, surprisingly, not clathrin. Furthermore, they show that polarized AP-2 colocalizes with a number of endocytic factors and polarized cargo, but not with clathrin or non-polarized cargo. Thus, they suggest that AP-2 has a (endocytic) role in polarization of the hyphal tip in filamentous fungi, which is independent of clathrin. A clathrin-independent endocytic role for AP-2 is a novel finding of broad interest to cell biologists. Although other AP complexes have been attributed clathrin-independent roles, these are not well understood. The here presented finding can contribute to our understanding of how endocytic adaptors function and of their specificity in cargo selection. Furthermore, it is interesting with regard to the role of clathrin function, especially its dispensability for some endocytic pathways.

When at all possible, quantification of multiple cells in multiple images should be carried out to support interpretations based on the images presented, as was done in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. For example, in the analysis of transporter uptake in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, the authors conclude that <i>ap2</i>\u2206 does not inhibit internalization (subsection \u201cAP complexes are dispensable for membrane traffic and endocytosis of transporters\u201d, last paragraph), but there is little apparent difference between control and endocytic trigger images of AgtA-GFP or FurA-GFP, suggesting that little internalization occurred in response to the endocytic trigger in these strains. Quantification of internalization or the level of transporter remaining at the cell surface could address this issue. In <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C-E</a>, the authors conclude that the effects of double mutants on morphology is additive (subsection \u201cFurther genetic and cellular evidence that AP-2 is involved in apical lipid maintenance\u201d, first paragraph) but most of the double mutant images resemble the single <i>ap2</i>\u2206 mutant.

There is the possibility that ClaL depletion does not have a strong effect on triskelia, so they should heavy chain depletion. However, if the heavy chain depletion also does not affect flippase polarization, the clear genetic distinction between the pathways would be sufficient for an initial report."

The authors propose that clathrin-independent function applies to AP-2 in all dikarya (e.g. Abstract), and suggest that the AP-1 complex in dikarya also functions in a clathrin-independent manner (Discussion, third paragraph). These proposals are based primarily on the phylogenetic analysis in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, which shows that higher fungal species encode \u03b2 subunits that are shorter than mammalian \u03b2 subunits, lacking the folded domains in mammalian \u03b2 appendages that are involved in binding clathrin and clathrin-accessory proteins. However, there is direct evidence that the S. cerevisaie AP-1 complex binds clathrin through the C-terminal regions of the \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits and functions in clathrin-dependent transport, even though the \u03b2 subunit also lacks the folded appendage domains of mammalian \u03b2 subunits (e.g. Yeung and Payne. 2001. Traffic 2(8):565-76). By extension, other fungal AP complexes with \u03b2 subunits lacking folded appendage domains could have the potential to interact with clathrin through clathrin binding sequences in the non-conserved \u03b2 \"hinge\" region and \u03b1 appendage domain. Furthermore, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> AP-2 localizes to endocytic sites that are associated with clathrin (Carrol et al. 2009. Dev Cell 17(4):552-60, 2011; Carroll et al., 2012. Mol Biol Cell 23(4):657-68), making it likely that AP-2 functions with clathrin even though it does not exhibit strong clathrin binding (Yeung et al. 1999. Mol Biol Cell 10(11):3643-59). For these reasons, the authors' interpretation of the phylogenetic analysis in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> is questionable and it is difficult to predict whether clathrin-independent function described for <i>A. nidulans</i> will be a general feature of AP-2 in other higher fungal species. At a minimum, the manuscript should be rewritten to consider the data from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and moderate any conclusions about other fungi."

Mol Biol Cell 23(4):657-68), making it likely that AP-2 functions with clathrin even though it does not exhibit strong clathrin binding (Yeung et al. 1999. Mol Biol Cell 10(11):3643-59). For these reasons, the authors' interpretation of the phylogenetic analysis in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> is questionable and it is difficult to predict whether clathrin-independent function described for A. nidulans will be a general feature of AP-2 in other higher fungal species. At a minimum, the manuscript should be rewritten to consider the data from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and moderate any conclusions about other fungi."

                    "text": "The manuscript by Martzoukou et al. provides evidence suggesting that in the filamentous yeast <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i>: 1) clathrin plays endocytic roles in membrane transporter internalization, which are independent of the AP-2 adaptor; 2) the AP-2 adaptor is required for polarity maintenance and proper hypha growth and; 3) AP-2 plays a role in maintenance of lipid polarity, which is clathrin-independent and which probably implies the clathrin-independent internalization of the lipid flippases DnfA and DnfB. From these three main conclusions, the last one is most novel, provided that AP-2-independent clathrin functions in endocytosis have already been demonstrated in mammalian cells and yeast and that a role of AP-2 in maintenance of polarity has already been demonstrated in <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. The 3rd conclusion is novel and provides an interesting research avenue but the data supporting it is rather preliminary. The third conclusion is mainly supported by three observations: 1) the sequence known to mediate direct clathrin binding is missing from the \u03b22 adaptin subunit of higher fungi; 2) depletion of the clathrin light chain with a repressible promoter does not cause depolarization of the lipid flippases or ergosterol, whereas depletion of the AP-2 \u00b5 or \u03c3 subunits does and finally; 3) the AP-2 complex barely co-localizes with a ClaL-GFP construct. There are some concerns regarding all these experiments or the conclusions derived from there. For example, even AP-2 might have lost its capacity to directly bind clathrin in dikarya, it might still be indirectly recruited to clathrin pits and vesicles through binding to other endocytic adaptors. Thus, one would need to demonstrate that AP-2 assembled at the plasma membrane do not colocalize at any time (in time lapse movies) with clathrin. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> intends to address this issue by showing that the degree of co-localization of AP-2 and the clathrin light chain is lower than the co-localization with other endocytic markers. This could be a valid argument if the authors could assure that the ClaL-GFP construct is competent for its endocytic functions. This construct shows a somehow strange pattern showing big intracellular clumps, while staining at the plasma membrane seems to be completely absent. The author should maybe know that C-terminal tagging of the clathrin light chain in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> results in a partially miss-functional protein. Analysis of the co-localization with the endogenous protein or with an N-terminal GFP-ClaL chimera should be included. Also, functional analysis of the GFP and mCherry chimeras used should be provided. Finally, most experiments that show phenotypical differences between the knock out of the AP-2 subunits and clathrin are performed with the constitutive deletions of the AP-2 subunits but with a thiamine repressible construct for the ClaL. It is not clearly defined in the figure legend or the Materials and methods for how long and to what extend the expression of the clathrin light chain is repressed. It might well be that under the conditions used, the ClaL is not fully depleted. Further, the levels of the clathrin heavy chain and its capacity to form triskelions should be analyzed under these conditions. In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, it is known that constitutive deletion of the clathrin light chain cause strong membrane traffic phenotypes because it results in concomitant depletion of the clathrin heavy chain and its inability to form triskelions. However, most <i>clc1</i>\u2206 phenotypes can be overcome by overexpression of the heavy chain (including triskelion assembly). It might well be that under the experimental conditions used in this work, enough triskelions are still present in the cell to support endocytosis of the lipid flippases. To provide strong evidence that the DnfA and DnfB flippases are internalized in an Ap-2 dependent and clathrin-independent manner, the authors would need to analyze the localization of the flippases in the constitutive ClaL mutant and in clathrin heavy chain depleted cells. Further, the authors would need to demonstrate that the flippases can be crosslinked to AP-2 but not to clahtrin. Finally, it would be interesting to investigate the localization of DnfA in a double AP-2-mu and ClaL Knock out. It could be that clathrin deficiency reestablished DnfA polarization by compensating an endocytic defect with slower secretion or recycling rates. If this is the case, depletion of clathrin in an AP-2 mutant would restore polarity. If this is not the case, the double mutant should show a defect similar to the AP-2 mutant."

They should then use the ClaL-mRFP to check co-localization with AP-2, not ClaL-GFP (which shows some obvious defects in growth). Even if they use the ClaL-mRFP (that seems to complement better than the ClaL-GFP), most CLaL signal appears in the Golgi and will mask possible co-localization analysis with AP-2 at the plasma membrane. The authors still need to apply TIRF to analyze the co-localization of CLa and AP-2. They only show TIRF to demonstrate that some CLa-GFP seems to be recruited to the plasma membrane. Indeed, in the images shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, one can see a clear co-localization of AP-2 and clathrin in the subapical region, if the putative Golgi signal is subtracted."

The experiment depleting CLaH for 5 hours is rather useless because clathrin is a quite stable protein and therefore, most of it, might still be there.

What might have escaped to the reviewers is that different transporters exhibit different endocytic \u2018sensitivities\u2019. For example, FurA (allantoin transporter) is extremely stable in the absence of an endocytic signal and only partially internalized in the presence of endocytic triggers. On the other extreme, FcyB (purine-cytosine transporter) and AgtA (acidic amino acid transporter) are rather unstable, showing a degree of constitutive endocytosis even in the absence of endocytic signals. This difference in stabilities is in fact the reason we selected different transporters for testing the role of AP-2 or clathrin in transporter endocytosis. So, in some cases, as in AgtA-GFP or FurA-GFP, which the reviewer specifically refers, the images, indeed, show little difference.

This picture was obtained independently from the presence or absence of any endocytic trigger (e.g. ammonium). Given that ClaH is principally localized in late Golgi, as rigorously shown in the recent publication of Schultzhaus et al., 2016, the picture we obtained in respect to the role of ClaH in UapA-GFP localization is compatible with that expected in case of severe block of conventional cargo (transporter) secretion. Interestingly, when ClaH expression is repressed after an initial period of pre-growth (that is, after of UapA-GFP has been secreted to the PM), a significant fraction of UapA-GFP is detected in the PM in the absence of an endocytic trigger, and some is still detectable after the endocytic trigger. This might suggest that ClaH, similar to ClaL, is also needed for transporter endocytosis. The fact that we detect significant turnover of UapA-GFP in the absence of ClaH might well be related to Golgi and endosome collapse and progressive hyphae lethality, which in turn is expected to create a dramatic cellular stress resulting in massive internalization and turnover of plasma membrane transporters/cargoes. Additional evidence for the role of ClaH in conventional secretion via the Golgi was obtained by following the localization of DnfA-GFP or DnfB-GFP in the relevant knockdown strains (revised <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). As in the case of UapA-GFP, when ClaH is repressed from the beginning of growth, DnfA-GFP or DnfB-GFP appear to be cytoplasmically localized, marking bulbous, cytoplasmic bodies and a membrane-like network, compatible with Golgi/endosome collapse. Importantly however, when ClaH expression is repressed after an initial period of pre-growth (that is, after DnfA-GFP or DnfB-GFP have been polarly localized), the pre-established polarity of both flippases is conserved."

The authors propose that clathrin-independent function applies to AP-2 in all dikarya (e.g. Abstract), and suggest that the AP-1 complex in dikarya also functions in a clathrin-independent manner (Discussion, third paragraph). These proposals are based primarily on the phylogenetic analysis in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, which shows that higher fungal species encode \u03b2 subunits that are shorter than mammalian \u03b2 subunits, lacking the folded domains in mammalian \u03b2 appendages that are involved in binding clathrin and clathrin-accessory proteins. However, there is direct evidence that the S. cerevisaie AP-1 complex binds clathrin through the C-terminal regions of the \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits and functions in clathrin-dependent transport, even though the \u03b2 subunit also lacks the folded appendage domains of mammalian \u03b2 subunits (e.g. Yeung and Payne. 2001. Traffic 2(8):565-76). By extension, other fungal AP complexes with \u03b2 subunits lacking folded appendage domains could have the potential to interact with clathrin through clathrin binding sequences in the non-conserved \u03b2 \"hinge\" region and \u03b1 appendage domain. Furthermore, S. cerevisiae AP-2 localizes to endocytic sites that are associated with clathrin (Carrol et al. 2009. Dev Cell 17(4):552-60, 2011; Carroll et al., 2012. Mol Biol Cell 23(4):657-68), making it likely that AP-2 functions with clathrin even though it does not exhibit strong clathrin binding (Yeung et al. 1999. Mol Biol Cell 10(11):3643-59). For these reasons, the authors' interpretation of the phylogenetic analysis in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> is questionable and it is difficult to predict whether clathrin-independent function described for A. nidulans will be a general feature of AP-2 in other higher fungal species. At a minimum, the manuscript should be rewritten to consider the data from S. cerevisiae and moderate any conclusions about other fungi.</i>"

In Schultzhaus et al., 2016b, it is also shown that ClaH and ClaL co-localize significantly (although not totally), providing further indirect evidence that AP-2 does not co-localize with clathrin."

From these three main conclusions, the last one is most novel, provided that AP-2-independent clathrin functions in endocytosis have already been demonstrated in mammalian cells and yeast and that a role of AP-2 in maintenance of polarity has already been demonstrated in C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. The 3rd conclusion is novel and provides an interesting research avenue but the data supporting it is rather preliminary. The third conclusion is mainly supported by three observations: 1) the sequence known to mediate direct clathrin binding is missing from the \u03b22 adaptin subunit of higher fungi; 2) depletion of the clathrin light chain with a repressible promoter does not cause depolarization of the lipid flippases or ergosterol, whereas depletion of the AP-2 \u00b5 or \u03c3 subunits does and finally; 3) the AP-2 complex barely co-localizes with a ClaL-GFP construct. There are some concerns regarding all these experiments or the conclusions derived from there. For example, even AP-2 might have lost its capacity to directly bind clathrin in dikarya, it might still be indirectly recruited to clathrin pits and vesicles through binding to other endocytic adaptors. Thus, one would need to demonstrate that AP-2 assembled at the plasma membrane do not colocalize at any time (in time lapse movies) with clathrin. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> intends to address this issue by showing that the degree of co-localization of AP-2 and the clathrin light chain is lower than the co-localization with other endocytic markers. This could be a valid argument if the authors could assure that the ClaL-GFP construct is competent for its endocytic functions. This construct shows a somehow strange pattern showing big intracellular clumps, while staining at the plasma membrane seems to be completely absent. The author should maybe know that C-terminal tagging of the clathrin light chain in S. cerevisiae results in a partially miss-functional protein. Analysis of the co-localization with the endogenous protein or with an N-terminal GFP-ClaL chimera should be included. Also, functional analysis of the GFP and mCherry chimeras used should be provided. Finally, most experiments that show phenotypical differences between the knock out of the AP-2 subunits and clathrin are performed with the constitutive deletions of the AP-2 subunits but with a thiamine repressible construct for the ClaL. It is not clearly defined in the figure legend or the Materials and methods for how long and to what extend the expression of the clathrin light chain is repressed. It might well be that under the conditions used, the ClaL is not fully depleted. Further, the levels of the clathrin heavy chain and its capacity to form triskelions should be analyzed under these conditions. In S. cerevisiae, it is known that constitutive deletion of the clathrin light chain cause strong membrane traffic phenotypes because it results in concomitant depletion of the clathrin heavy chain and its inability to form triskelions. However, most clc1\u2206 phenotypes can be overcome by overexpression of the heavy chain (including triskelion assembly). It might well be that under the experimental conditions used in this work, enough triskelions are still present in the cell to support endocytosis of the lipid flippases. To provide strong evidence that the DnfA and DnfB flippases are internalized in an Ap-2 dependent and clathrin-independent manner, the authors would need to analyze the localization of the flippases in the constitutive ClaL mutant and in clathrin heavy chain depleted cells. Further, the authors would need to demonstrate that the flippases can be crosslinked to AP-2 but not to clahtrin. Finally, it would be interesting to investigate the localization of DnfA in a double AP-2-mu and ClaL Knock out. It could be that clathrin deficiency reestablished DnfA polarization by compensating an endocytic defect with slower secretion or recycling rates. If this is the case, depletion of clathrin in an AP-2 mutant would restore polarity. If this is not the case, the double mutant should show a defect similar to the AP-2 mutant.</i>"

We did not investigate the localization of DnfA in a double AP-2 and ClaL mutant, but this seems an interesting proposal for the future. The present work does not intend to study possible interactions of different trafficking pathways in specific mutant backgrounds, but rather present strong evidence on the distinct roles of AP-2 and clathrin. Finally, the thiA<sub>p</sub> promoter is a very well-studied tool in Aspergillus laboratories and there is evidence that its repression by 5-10 mM thiamine for more than 3 h leads to depletion of gene products expressed through it. In our case we used both 5 and 10 h repression with identical results. Repression of ClaL or ClaH for 5h proved to fully block transporter endocytosis or to lead Golgi disfunctioning similar to the one we get using BFA, strongly suggesting the in our conditions clathrin heavy chains are totally depleted."

It should be possible to convincingly show that ClaH is efficiently knocked down in the thiamine experiments that target depletion of ClaH! Quantitative immunoblots should be a good control for that. We are not convinced that endocytic assays such as FM4-64 uptake or LatA treatments are able to discriminate between the clathrin-dependent and the AP-2-dependent pathways, as it is likely that the two share parts of the machinery (It appears that what differs between the two is cargo and localization \u2013 both addressed by the authors).</i>"

ClaH and levels are dramatically reduced (7% of the non-repressed levels) after 10 h or o/n repression by thiamine (practically to the level obtained by continuous presence of thiamine), but not when repression was only for 5 h. A similar result was obtained with ClaL (not shown). Thus, in the revised version we removed data with 5 h repression, and only show results from the epifluorescence analysis of samples repressed for either o/n (for ClaL) or 10 h (for ClaH). Repression and depletion of ClaH led to an apparent dramatic block of cargo secretion, similar to the block obtained after o/n repression, or BFA addition. Although polar deposition of DnfA or DnfB was significantly lost when ClaH was depleted, a degree of polarization was still evident. The effect of ClaH depletion on the polar localization of flippases is similar to the effect of BFA, strongly suggesting that a block in secretion is essential for <i>maintaining</i>, rather than <i>establishing,</i> the polar localization of apical markers. The non-essentiality of the clathrin complex for the initial polar depositioning of DnfA or DnfB is otherwise clearly supported in samples where ClaL is genetically depleted. In this case, where secretion is not blocked, we detected propter polarization of flippases."

However, still the more logical scenario is that the observed modification on DnfA or DnfB polar depositioning is a direct consequence of blocked secretion in the absence of ClaH, and as also seen in the presence of BFA. In anyway, this does not affect our primary conclusion that AP-2 and clathrin have distinct roles in secretion (AP-2 independent, ClaH-dependent) and polar maintenance of apical markers (AP-2-dependent, ClaL-independent)."
