Combining functional neuroimaging with multivariate pattern analyses, we identified dissociable patterns that predicted somatic (high versus low: 100%) and vicarious (high versus low: 100%) pain intensity in out-of-sample individuals. Critically, each pattern was at chance in predicting the other experience, demonstrating separate modifiability of both patterns. Somatotopy (upper versus lower limb: 93% accuracy for both conditions) was also distinct, located in somatosensory versus mentalizing-related circuits for somatic and vicarious pain, respectively. Two additional studies demonstrated the generalizability of the somatic pain pattern (which was originally developed on thermal pain) to mechanical and electrical pain, and also demonstrated the replicability of the somatic/vicarious dissociation. These findings suggest possible mechanisms underlying limitations in feeling others\u2019 pain, and present new, more specific, brain targets for studying pain empathy."

Combining functional neuroimaging with multivariate pattern analyses, we identified dissociable patterns that predicted somatic (high versus low: 100%) and vicarious (high versus low: 100%) pain intensity in out-of-sample individuals. Critically, each pattern was at chance in predicting the other experience, demonstrating separate modifiability of both patterns. Somatotopy (upper versus lower limb: 93% accuracy for both conditions) was also distinct, located in somatosensory versus mentalizing-related circuits for somatic and vicarious pain, respectively. Two additional studies demonstrated the generalizability of the somatic pain pattern (which was originally developed on thermal pain) to mechanical and electrical pain, and also demonstrated the replicability of the somatic/vicarious dissociation. These findings suggest possible mechanisms underlying limitations in feeling others\u2019 pain, and present new, more specific, brain targets for studying pain empathy."

One theory suggests that vicarious pain involves <i>shared experience</i>, activating neural circuits that represent somatic pain in the perceiver. Such theories are based largely on overlapping activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insular (aINS) cortices when both experiencing pain and observing pain in others (<a href=\"#bib15\">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Jackson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Lamm et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Ogino et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Singer et al., 2004</a>). Such overlaps have also been found in primary and secondary somatosensory areas [i.e., SI and SII] (<a href=\"#bib42\">Jackson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Keysers et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Lamm et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Singer et al., 2004</a>). Witnessing others in pain can increase one\u2019s own pain (<a href=\"#bib56\">Langford et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Loggia et al., 2008</a>), and placebos given for somatic pain can also reduce vicarious \u2018pain\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib82\">R\u00fctgen et al., 2015</a>). Together, these findings have been taken as brain evidence for shared representation of pain. In particular, dACC and aINS activation are thought to reflect a kind of shared experience that has been described in terms of 'neural resonance' (<a href=\"#bib106\">Zaki et al., 2012</a>), and as 'automatic' (<a href=\"#bib88\">Singer et al., 2004</a>). By this account, empathy is 'built <i>bottom up</i> from relatively simple mechanisms of action production and perception' (<a href=\"#bib40\">Iacoboni, 2009</a>)."

Others\u2019 pain need not activate somatic pain representations to be aversive (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chang et al., 2015</a>), and empathy may work by engaging other emotional systems apart from \u2018pain in oneself\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hooker et al., 2008</a>). Unlike somatic pain, vicarious pain is all too easy to ignore. For example, many participants will inflict substantial pain on an innocent person when instructed to do so by authority figures (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheetham et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Milgram, 1963</a>).

It is possible that activity in portions of the\u00a0dACC is <i>preferentially</i> related to pain on average; for example, <a href=\"#bib58\">Lieberman and Eisenberger, 2015</a> used Neurosynth.org to identify a statistical association between studies using the term 'pain' and activation of the dACC. However, this does not mean that dACC activity is sufficient to infer pain, as the dACC responds to a variety of cognitive and emotional events that are not painful (<a href=\"#bib95\">Wager et al., 2016</a>). For instance, electrophysiological and optogenetic studies have identified neurons engaged during foraging behavior, attention, emotion, reward expectancy, skeletomotor and visceromotor activity, and other functions (<a href=\"#bib18\">Davis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Picard and Strick, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Shidara and Richmond, 2002</a>). \u2018Pain-encoding\u2019 portions of the dACC can be activated in individuals with a congenital insensitivity to pain (<a href=\"#bib83\">Salomons et al., 2016</a>). Only a small minority of dACC neurons are pain-related (<a href=\"#bib18\">Davis et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hutchison et al., 1999</a>), and the dACC encodes emotional events, including rejection and general negative emotion, in a way that is distinct from how it encodes pain (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Woo et al., 2014</a>). More fine-grained analyses of population-level representations are required to make inferences about pain based on activity in the dACC and other regions."

For a marker (e.g., a multivariate brain pattern) to serve as a representation of pain, it should satisfy three criteria. It should: a) closely track pain experience (be <i>sensitive</i> to the presence of pain); b) not respond to experiences that are defined as non-painful (be pain-<i>specific</i>); and c) generalize across multiple forms of pain (<a href=\"#bib101\">Woo and Wager, 2015</a>). Only to the degree that brain patterns <i>represent</i> somatic and vicarious pain does testing their similarity bear on shared representation theories. Previous studies [e.g.,(<a href=\"#bib15\">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2016</a>)] have compared the similarity of self-pain and other-pain patterns, but these patterns have not shown strong sensitivity to pain experience [criterion (<i>a</i>) above]. Indeed, prior work has suggested that sensitivity to pain and emotional experiences requires combining signals across brain regions and networks (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kassam et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Kragel and Labar, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Nummenmaa et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Wager et al., 2015</a>), whereas previous studies of vicarious pain have focused only on local patterns within a single region at a time. In addition, the patterns identified as shared across self- and other-pain have responded to other types of negative emotion (e.g., emotional pictures, disgust, and unfairness), and so do not satisfy criterion (<i>b</i>) for pain representations. Finally, no vicarious pain studies have tested generalizability of a specific brain pattern across types of pain [criterion (<i>c</i>)]."

Between-participant machine learning analyses were used to identify patterns that test <i>sensitivity</i> [i.e., satisfy criterion (<i>a</i>)\u00a0above] for both pain modalities (i.e., somatic vs. vicarious), and to provide an unbiased test of similarity and cross-prediction across somatic and vicarious pain predictive patterns. In addition, we tested somatotopy (upper versus lower limb) within sensory cortices and other systems for both pain modalities, and compared the somatotopic representations.

The NPS has over 90% sensitivity and specificity in predicting somatic pain relative to several other salient states, including non-painful warmth, anticipated pain, pain recall (<a href=\"#bib96\">Wager et al., 2013</a>), social rejection (<a href=\"#bib99\">Woo et al., 2014</a>), and general negative emotion (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chang et al., 2015</a>). In the current paper, Study 2 and Study 3 tested the generalizability of the NPS to mechanical and electrical pain, respectively [addressing criterion (<i>c</i>) above]. Study 3 also provided a replication of the sensitivity, specificity, and similarity of somatic and vicarious pain predictive patterns. Our primary goal was to identify\u2014and test the similarity of\u2014whole-brain patterns for somatic and vicarious pain that generalize across individuals and can be tested prospectively in multiple studies. However, we also conducted analyses focused on the dACC and aINS specifically, and on pain-predictive patterns identified for each individual participant. In addition, we conducted \u2018searchlight\u2019 analyses designed to test the maximal similarity of local brain patterns related to somatic and vicarious pain across the brain, and provide inferences on whether distributed, whole-brain patterns are necessary to capture representations of both somatic and vicarious pain."

This mirrors the side of painful stimulation from the observer\u2019s point of view in an allocentric reference frame, but not an egocentric one; thus, laterality could conceivably play a role. To test this, we repeated the signature response analysis with a left-right flipped version of the VPS pattern (excluding the occipital cortex), which preserves the pattern but with opposite laterality. The results remained the same: The flipped VPS pattern did not track somatic pain intensity (<i>t<sub>UL</sub></i>(27) = 1.47, <i>n.s., t<sub>LL</sub></i>(27) = 0.04, <i>n.s.</i>, accuracy<i><sub>Hsom-Lsom</sub></i> = 50%, <i>n.s.</i>), but did track vicarious pain intensity (<i>t<sub>UL</sub></i>(27) = 2.68, p&lt;0.05, <i>t<sub>LL</sub></i>(27) = 2.53, p&lt;0.05, accuracy<i><sub>Hvic-Lvic</sub></i> = 79%, p&lt;0.005).

But can a representation of vicarious pain be identified, and if so, is it conserved across individuals so that it can be prospectively compared with somatic pain and related to empathetic behavior?

They are similar in that they are both aversive, salient, and attention-capturing. They differ in their sensory input modalities (somatosensory versus visual) and likely many of the cognitive processes involved. Brain activity, including both regional activation and multivariate patterns, may reflect any or all of these processes. For this reason, it is necessary to test the similarity of the brain patterns that <i>most closely encode pain experiences of each type</i>. We have proposed three criteria for identifying patterns that may be used to make inferences about pain representation. Such patterns should be (a) sensitive to pain, and thus respond in proportion to its experience; (b) specific to pain, and not activated by non-painful events; and (c) generalizable across varied instances of the type of pain. For example, a brain pattern that encodes \u2018pain affect\u2019\u2014whether common to self- and other-pain or not\u2014should increase as pain affect increases,\u00a0and not respond to non-painful forms of negative emotion such as disgust (<a href=\"#bib107\">Zaki et al., 2016</a>). Previous studies have identified both shared and dissimilar patterns of activity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">2016</a>) in local dACC and aINS regions. Though an important step, these patterns have not been shown to track pain experience with meaningfully large effect sizes, and our findings here suggest that local regions are insufficient to do so. In addition, they have not identified a pattern that tracks \u2018pain affect\u2019 specifically and does not respond to other negative emotions."

Though they do not test many other kinds of emotions, the patterns are demonstrably specific to either pain for oneself or another. In addition, a lack of correlations between the NPS, VPS, and patterns predictive of rejection and negative emotion further suggest that these patterns are not sensitive to general emotional arousal. Fortunately, the between-participant patterns we identified here can be prospectively tested for generalizability to other emotions and paradigms in future studies. Indeed, in an initial step towards broader generalizability, we showed that the sensitivity and specificity of both patterns generalize to new studies, and that our putative somatic pain representation, the NPS, generalizes across three types of somatic pain."

However, our approach is not guaranteed to be maximally sensitive to shared representations. Optimizing for shared representation would require using machine-learning approaches to predict pain in a modality-nonspecific fashion. Another important issue is individual differences in the experience of vicarious pain. Having established pain-predictive brain patterns as we do here, subsequent studies could include stimuli that are externally matched, and brain responses in the 'vicarious pain signature' are correlated meaningfully with empathy ratings across participants. In addition, the VPS could potentially be used to test clinical populations: for example, whether patients in chronic pain show greater (or lesser) responses to others\u2019 suffering. These questions are beyond the scope of the present study, but could be undertaken in future work."

Somatic stimulation was administered as thermal pain, which was applied on the volar surface of the left forearm (i.e., upper limb) and dorsal surface of the left foot (i.e., lower limb)\u00a0using a TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer (Medoc Ltd., Chapel Hill, NC) with a 16\u2009mm Peltier thermode end plate. Three levels of somatic stimulation (pseudo-randomly assigned to each participant)\u2014low (44 or 45\u00b0C), medium (46 or 47\u00b0C) and high (48 or 49\u00b0C)\u2014were applied to four different locations on both the upper limb and lower limb . Each stimulation lasted a total of 11s\u00a0with a 2s ramp-up and a 2s ramp down, and 7s at the peak target temperature. The participants made responses on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which had anchors based on a labeled magnitude rating scale (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bartoshuk, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Green et al., 1996</a>) for No Sensation (0% of scale length), Barely Detectable (1.4% of scale length), Weak (6.1% of scale length), Moderate (17.2% of scale length), Strong (35.4% of scale length), Very Strong (53.3% of scale length), and Strongest Imaginable Sensation (100% of scale length). Participants first made a moment-by-moment rating where for the duration of the trial, as they experienced any sensation, they used a pointer on the screen to move continuously along the rating scale and indicate the level of sensation they felt at each moment. They then made an overall rating at the end of each trial to indicate the maximum overall sensation they experienced in that trial. As part of the calibration procedure, participants also viewed pictures for 11s (to match the thermal pain trials) depicting varying levels of injury occurring on the right hand or foot (<a href=\"#bib42\">Jackson et al., 2005</a>). Participants were given the instruction, 'Imagine the experience if the situation in each picture happened to you, and rate how much sensation you would feel in that situation'. They used the same visual analog scale as the somatic pain calibration to make their ratings\u2014a moment-by-moment rating while they viewed the picture and an overall rating about their experience after each trial. Participants who successfully completed the calibration procedure were then scheduled for the <i>f</i>MRI\u00a0experimental sessions."

This paradigm used uncomfortable electrodermal stimulation (low current) (<a href=\"#bib53\">LaBar et al., 1998</a>) applied to the left extremity (lower medial side above the ankle). This is an S1-S2 paradigm with 1s of S1 for safe/stimulation cue and 1s of S2 with/without stimulation, with an inter stimulus interval (ISI) of 3s. The inter trial interval (ITI) was jittered (4\u201312s, exponentially distributed, mean = 5s). Mean duration for each trial was 10s. Different colored squares, identical in shape, size, and luminance, served as the cue and target stimuli. Participants were instructed to view visual stimulus squares (red, blue, yellow, or green) presented pseudo-randomly. Participants were informed that a red square with the word 'STIMULATION', when presented, indicates that stimulation may follow when a yellow square appears. They were also informed that a blue square with the word 'SAFE' indicates that there was no stimulation when a yellow square appears. Each run had 48 counterbalanced trials with 24 safe trials and 24 stimulation trials. Electrodermal stimulation was given during 50% of the S2 period of the stimulation trials (12 of 24 trials) when the 'STIMULATION' stimulus preceded the yellow square. In addition, there were 4 catch trials with the word 'PRESS' to instruct the participant to press a button to ensure that participants were watching the screen. There was a 30s resting period at the beginning and end of each run. Each run took 580s or\u00a0about 10 min. Two runs of the shock pain paradigm were conducted. Due to the fact that the threshold for pain perception varies markedly among individuals, the intensity was decided and recorded individually before scanning at a medium level of pain tolerable by the participant (using a 5-point scale). No active task was required for shock or safe trials. However, participants were instructed\u00a0to press a button when they saw the target following the 'PRESS' cue in order to maintain their attention during scanning. Pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings by each participant were also collected at the end of each run with a 5-point scale using a glove response device."

The order and scan sequences were as follows: (1) A low resolution sagittal high speed scout image; (2) A high-resolution T2-weighted anatomical volume of the whole brain, acquired on an axial plane parallel to the AC-PC line with a turbo spin-echo (TSE) pulse sequence with the following parameters: 40 axial slices of 4\u2009mm thick, skip=0\u2009mm, TR = 4050 ms, TE = 99 ms, flip angle=170\u00b0, field of view (FOV)=240\u2009mm, matrix size=448\u00d7512, voxel size=0.47\u00d70.47\u00d74 mm<sup>3</sup>; (3) T2*-weighted images. Slices were obtained corresponding to the T2-weighted images. The <i>f</i>MRI imaging was performed using a gradient echoplanar imaging (GE-EPI) sequence: 40 axial slices, 4\u00a0mm thick, and skip=0\u00a0mm, TR = 2500\u00a0ms, TE = 27\u00a0ms, Flip angle = 82\u00b0, FOV=240\u00a0mm, and matrix size=64\u00d764. Each run started with 2 dummy volumes before the onset of the task to allow for equilibration of T1 saturation effects. Stimulation events were modeled as single trials. The order of trials in each block/run was randomized with optimized efficiency. A total of two EPI runs with 232 image volumes per run for the shock paradigm and a total of four EPI runs with 165 image volumes per run for the observed pain paradigm were acquired for each participant."

Regressors were created by convolving a train of delta functions representing the sequence of individual events with the default SPM basis function, which consists of a synthetic hemodynamic response function composed of two gamma functions (<a href=\"#bib25\">Friston et al., 1998</a>). For shock pain, there were six regressors (all cues, stimulation cues, all targets, targets with stimulation cues, stimulation, and catch trials); for observed pain, there were two regressors (painful, non-painful). Six parameters generated during motion correction were entered as covariates. Shock pain \u2013 baseline, and observed pain \u2013 baseline contrast images were calculated for each participant."

We also applied the pattern to an independent replication dataset, which showed that the VPS dissociates somatic versus vicarious pain, and included two additional, independent datasets that confirm the generalizability of the NPS across pain modalities (heat, shock, and pressure), and confirms that the NPS is distinct from the VPS. Thus, these findings can be used, tested, and extended by many groups, allowing us to build a cumulative neuroscience of affect across laboratories."

Though vicarious pain and social rejection share common involvement of some brain regions, such as the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex, they largely involve distinct regions even at the macroscopic scale. The social rejection pattern identified in <a href=\"#bib99\">Woo et al. (2014)</a> involves a distinct set of regions associated with emotion generation [e.g., (<a href=\"#bib60\">Lindquist et al., 2012</a>)], including the ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, medial thalamus, and supplementary motor cortex. Thus, vicarious pain, somatic pain, and social rejection are distinct classes of affective experience, with distinct neural signatures that we can now identify and distinguish empirically."

The authors clearly demonstrate that the conflation of the brain representations of self and other pain is not warranted and that has been 'verified' without the simple but telling tests that the authors use in this paper. In particular, the authors compare 3 different intensities and 2 different locations and then toss in two additional modalities at single intensity and location. The work is compelling and shows that the somatic pain signature is different from the vicarious pain one. The important take-home message is (in the authors words) that \"vicarious pain does not involve re-activation of somatosensory representations. Rather, body site-specific representations of vicarious pain may be accomplished using the mPFC 'mentalizing' system and perhaps other ideomotor systems.\""
