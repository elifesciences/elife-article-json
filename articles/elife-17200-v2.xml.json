The Wg/Wnt morphogen reception is essential for signal activation, whose activity is mediated through the receptor complex and a scaffold protein Dishevelled (Dsh). We report here that the exon junction complex (EJC) activity is indispensable for Wg signaling by maintaining an appropriate level of Dsh protein for Wg ligand reception in <i>Drosophila</i>. Transcriptome analyses in <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal discs indicate that the EJC controls the splicing of the cell polarity gene <i>discs large 1 (dlg1</i>), whose coding protein directly interacts with Dsh. Genetic and biochemical experiments demonstrate that Dlg1 protein acts independently from its role in cell polarity to protect Dsh protein from lysosomal degradation. More importantly, human orthologous Dlg protein is sufficient to promote Dvl protein stabilization and Wnt signaling activity, thus revealing a conserved regulatory mechanism of Wg/Wnt signaling by Dlg and EJC."

The Wg/Wnt morphogen reception is essential for signal activation, whose activity is mediated through the receptor complex and a scaffold protein Dishevelled (Dsh). We report here that the exon junction complex (EJC) activity is indispensable for Wg signaling by maintaining an appropriate level of Dsh protein for Wg ligand reception in <i>Drosophila</i>. Transcriptome analyses in <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal discs indicate that the EJC controls the splicing of the cell polarity gene <i>discs large 1 (dlg1</i>), whose coding protein directly interacts with Dsh. Genetic and biochemical experiments demonstrate that Dlg1 protein acts independently from its role in cell polarity to protect Dsh protein from lysosomal degradation. More importantly, human orthologous Dlg protein is sufficient to promote Dvl protein stabilization and Wnt signaling activity, thus revealing a conserved regulatory mechanism of Wg/Wnt signaling by Dlg and EJC."

The experiments show that an RNA binding protein family named the Exon Junction Complex positively regulates a protein called Dishevelled, which serves as a hub in the Wingless/Wnt pathway. The Exon Junction Complex keeps the amount of Dishevelled protein in check via an interaction with another protein referred to as Discs large. Further experiments indicated that Discs large binds to and protects Dishevelled from being degraded inside the cell."

Given the importance of Wg/Wnt signaling in many cellular processes, it is not surprising that dysregulation of Wg/Wnt signaling in humans results in developmental defects as well as cancer (<a href=\"#bib40\">MacDonald et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, Wg ligand binds to the seven-pass transmembrane receptors Frizzled/Frizzled2 (Fz/Fz2) and a co-receptor Arrow (Arr), a homolog of vertebrate LRP5/6. Formation of this trimeric complex activates a scaffold protein Dishevelled (Dsh) on the plasma membrane, leading to disruption of the Axin-mediated degradation complex and hence stabilization of Armadillo (Arm), a homolog of vertebrate \u03b2-catenin. Accumulated Arm then translocates to the nucleus to activate target gene transcription\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib39\">MacDonald and He, 2012)</a>. Although core components of the Wg/Wnt signaling cascade have been identified, gaps in the understanding of this critical signaling pathway still remain to be filled. To unveil novel regulators of Wg signaling, we conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in the developing <i>Drosophila</i> wing, from which a RNA binding exon junction complex (EJC) emerged as a positive regulator of Wg signaling."

                        "text": "The EJC is known to act in several aspects of posttranscriptional regulation, including mRNA localization, translation and degradation (<a href=\"#bib71\">Tange et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Le Hir et al., 2016</a>). After transcription, the pre-mRNA associated subunit eIF4AIII is loaded to nascent transcripts about 20\u201324 bases upstream of each exon junction, resulting in binding of Mago nashi (Mago)/Magoh and Tsunagi (Tsu)/Y14 proteins to form the pre-EJC core complex. The pre-EJC then recruits other proteins including Barentsz (Btz) to facilitate its diverse function (<a href=\"#bib60\">Shibuya et al., 2004</a>). In vertebrates, the EJC is known to ensure translation efficiency (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nott et al., 2004</a>) as well as to activate nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gatfield et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chang et al., 2007</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, however, the EJC does not contribute to NMD (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gatfield et al., 2003</a>). It is instead required for the <i>oskar</i> mRNA localization to the posterior pole of the oocyte (<a href=\"#bib46\">Newmark and Boswell, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hachet and Ephrussi, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mohr et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">van Eeden et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Palacios et al., 2004</a>). Very recently, the pre-EJC has been shown to play an important role in alternative splicing of mRNA in <i>Drosophila</i>. Reduced EJC expression results in two forms of aberrant splicing. One is the exon skipping, which occurs in <i>MAPK</i> and transcripts that contain long introns or are located at heterochromatin (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ashton-Beaucage et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Roignant and Treisman, 2010</a>). The other is the intron retention on <i>piwi</i> transcripts (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hayashi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Malone et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, transcriptome analyses in cultured cells indicates the role of EJC in alternative splicing is also conserved in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wang et al., 2014</a>)."

We find that the pre-EJC positively regulates Wg signaling through its effect on facilitating Wg morphogen reception. Further studies reveal that the basolateral cell polarity gene <i>discs large 1 (dlg1</i>) is an in vivo target of the pre-EJC in Wg signaling. We show that Dlg1 acts independently from its role on cell polarity to stabilize Dsh protein, thus allowing Wg protein internalization required for signaling activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that human Dlg2 exhibits a similar protective role on Dvl proteins to enhance Wnt signaling in cultured human cells. Taken together, our study unveils a conserved regulatory mechanism of the EJC and Dlg in Wg/Wnt signaling."

However, these screens failed to uncover a regulatory role of RNA processing in Wg signaling, probably due to the fact that most components of RNA machineries exhibit pleiotropic effects in early development. In an in vivo RNAi screen, we found that knocking down three core components of the pre-EJC, <i>tsu, mago</i> and <i>eIF4AIII</i>, respectively, resulted in loss of marginal tissues and sensory bristles in adult <i>Drosophila</i> wing blade (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure\u00a01\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013G</a>), which resembles stereotypical phenotypes associated with reduced Wg signaling. Furthermore, loss-of-function <i>tsu<sup>\u039418</sup></i> or <i>mago<sup>93D</sup></i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib55\">Roignant and Treisman, 2010</a>) displayed similar defects in wing development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). To confirm that Wg signaling was indeed altered in pre-EJC mutants, we examined in wing imaginal discs the expression of two Wg signaling targets, <i>senseless (sens</i>) and <i>Distal-less (Dll</i>) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Seto and Bellen, 2006</a>), which respond to graded Wg morphogen. We observed obvious loss of Sens and Dll\u00a0protein production in <i>tsu</i> or <i>mago</i> somatic clones (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013F</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>). However, Sens expression was not altered in somatic clones of <i>btz</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>), which is a cytoplasmic component of the EJC (<a href=\"#bib49\">Palacios et al., 2004</a>), suggesting that the role of EJC in Wg signaling is independent of its cytoplasmic function. To directly monitor transcriptional activity of Wg signaling in pre-EJC defective wing discs, two <i>lacZ</i> enhancer traps inserted in the genomic loci of Wg targets, <i>frizzled3 (fz3</i>) (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sivasankaran et al., 2000</a>) and <i>Dll</i>, were used. As expected, the expression of <i>fz3-lacZ</i> and <i>Dll-lacZ</i> was decreased when <i>tsu</i> activity was reduced (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H\u2013J</a>).\u00a0Taken together, the above data indicate that the pre-EJC activity is required for Wg signaling activation in the developing fly wing."

We found that the amount of Wg protein present in <i>tsu</i> or <i>mago</i>,\u00a0but\u00a0not\u00a0<i>btz</i>,\u00a0mutant clones was significantly increased (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E,F</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>). This finding was surprising given the observation that Wg signaling was downregulated in mutant cells. Clue to the understanding of this apparent contradiction came from the observation that Wg signaling was ectopically activated in wildtype cells immediately next to mutant clones (insets of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2C</a>). This result suggests that increased Wg protein present in mutant clones is sufficient to activate signaling in neighboring wildtype cells whilst mutant cells are incapable of receiving Wg input. Therefore, the Wg signaling defects observed in mutant cells could be caused by blockage of Wg reception at the plasma membrane. Consistent with this hypothesis, extracellular Wg protein (<a href=\"#bib66\">Strigini and Cohen, 2000</a>) accumulated significantly in both apical and basolateral extracellular spaces (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>).

Among 818 mRNAs whose expression was downregulated, we identified three genes, <i>dlg1, lethal (2) giant larvae [l(2)gl</i>] and <i>diablo (dbo</i>), whose protein products are known to directly interact with Dsh. qPCR and RT-PCR analyses were then performed to confirm <i>bona fide</i> Dsh interactors that potentially mediate the pre-EJC activity on Dsh (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). In both cases, <i>dlg1</i> was the candidate consistently exhibiting reduced expression in the pre-EJC-defective wing disc cells when compared with that in wildtype cells. These results fit well with RNA-seq analyses that the amount of <i>dlg1</i> mRNA was reduced by about 30% when the pre-EJC was dysfunctional. We suspected that reduced <i>dlg1</i> expression may be a consequence of altered RNA splicing. Apart from previously reported exon skipping caused by dysfunctional EJC (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ashton-Beaucage et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Roignant and Treisman, 2010</a>), we uncovered two additional aberrant splicing events (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The first event was exon inclusion, which retained exons that were normally efficiently spliced in specific isoforms (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). This event likely increases the usage of splice sites. Indeed the RNA-seq analyses revealed a slightly higher usage of annotated splice sites (i.e. 1.4% higher usage for 5\u2019 splice sites and 1.5% for 3\u2019 splice sites) in pre-EJC depleted wing disc cells compared with those in wildtype cells (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The second event utilized previously unidentified splice sites to generate new introns and exons (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">2B,C</a>; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>).

In contrast, the level of Dlg1 protein derived from a cDNA expression construct did not change (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Furthermore, we demonstrated that reduced <i>dlg1</i> expression led to accumulation of extracellular Wg (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>), attenuation of Wg signaling in wing discs (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013D</a>), and consequently loss of wing margin and sensory bristles in the adult wing blade (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>).

The relevance of such interaction was further illustrated in rescue experiments in which overexpressed <i>dsh</i> was able to largely rescue the wing margin defects associated with reduced <i>dlg1</i> activity (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3G</a>)."

                                "text": "Next, we investigated how Dlg1 modulates Dsh to facilitate Wg signaling. Knocking down <i>dlg1</i> by RNAi in S2 cells led to reduced production of Dsh protein, whilst overexpressing <i>dlg1</i> had an opposite effect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5C</a>). A similar result was observed in vivo when <i>dlg1</i> expression was manipulated in wing discs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013F</a>). The effect of Dlg1 on Dsh production may be a direct consequence of altered protein stability. Dsh protein ectopically produced in S2 cells exhibited a short half-life of around two hours (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The turnover of Dsh protein could be controlled through the ubiquitin-proteasome or lysosome mediated degradation. We found that the degradation of Dsh protein occurred mainly in lysosome when nascent protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide (CHX) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). This is consistent with the observation that Dsh colocalized with early endosome and late endosome/lysosome markers in wing discs as well as in S2 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H\u2013M</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Furthermore, heightened <i>dlg1</i> expression counteracted with the CHX effect on Dsh degradation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5N</a>). In contrast, Dsh degradation potentiated by <i>tsu</i> or <i>dlg1 RNAi</i> could be prevented when S2 cells were treated with a lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5O,P</a>). The above data indicate that the interaction between Dlg1 and Dsh protects Dsh protein from degradation in the lysosome. This conclusion was supported further by the observation that increased <i>dlg1</i> expression correlated with reduced degree of ubiquitination modification on Dsh, a form of posttranslational modifications required for protein degradation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5Q</a>)."

It is thus likely that Dlg1 orthologs could act in a similar manner to control Dvl protein stability in vertebrates. Human cells encode five orthologous Dlg proteins, Dlg1-5. However, only Dlg2 contains an intact K-K-x-x-x-\u03a8 motif required for Dsh interaction as elucidated in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Indeed, overproduced Dlg2, but not Dlg3, was sufficient to stabilize Dvl proteins in HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To further illustrate the importance of the K-K-x-x-x-\u03a8 motif of Dlg2 in stabilizing Dvl proteins, we generated a mutant form of Dlg2 (hDlg2KKAA) where two key lysine residues of the Hook domain were mutated to alanines. As predicted, this Dlg2 mutant failed to stabilize Dvl due to its inability to interact with Dvl (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Dlg1 and Dlg2 share extensive homology within the Hook domain except that an amino acid is missing in Dlg1\u2019s K-K-x-x-x-\u03a8 motif (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We replaced this motif in Dlg2 with amino acids found in Dlg1 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The resulting Dlg2SFI-NL mutant showed reduced interaction with Dvl and no effect on Dvl protein stabilization (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). To further demonstrate functional consequence of Dlg2 regulation on Dvl protein stability in Wnt signaling, we performed TOPFlash Luciferase Wnt signaling reporter assay in HEK293T cells. Overexpressed wildtype but not the KKAA mutant form of <i>dlg2</i> enhanced further the Dvl-induced TOPFlash reporter activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). The above experiments together indicate that the Dlg activity on Dvl protein homeostasis is conserved from flies to vertebrates."

However, our data presented here together with several recent studies argue that RNA regulatory machineries can act specifically on developmental signaling for pattern formation and organogenesis. It has been increasingly recognized that the production, transport or the location of mRNA are subject to precise regulation in Wg/Wnt signaling. For example, apical localization of <i>wg</i> RNA is essential for signal activation in epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib63\">Simmonds et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wilkie and Davis, 2001</a>), whilst the RNA binding protein RBM47 regulates Wnt signaling in zebrafish head development (<a href=\"#bib24\">Guan et al., 2013</a>) as well as in cancer (<a href=\"#bib75\">Vanharanta et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Venugopal et al., 2015</a>). The specific role of RNA machineries on cell signaling is not limited to Wg/Wnt signaling. It has been reported that RNA-binding protein Quaking specifically binds to the 3\u2019UTR of transcription factor <i>gli2a</i> mRNA to modulate Hedgehog signaling in zebrafish muscle development (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lobbardi et al., 2011</a>). RNA binding protein RBM5/6 and 10 could differentially control alternative splicing of a negative Notch regulator gene <i>NUMB</i>, thus antagonistically regulating the Notch signaling activity for cancer cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bechara et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, generally believed pleotropic RNA regulatory machineries emerge as important regulatory means to specifically control cell signaling and related developmental processes."

In light of our study of the EJC activity on <i>dlg1</i> mRNA as well as the roles of EJC on <i>mapk</i> and <i>piwi</i> splicing (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ashton-Beaucage et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Roignant and Treisman, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hayashi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Malone et al., 2014</a>), we suspect that EJC might regulate <i>oskar</i> mRNA splicing to mediate its mRNA localization. Our RNA-seq analyses identified several hundreds of candidate mRNAs whose expression may be directly or indirectly subjected to EJC regulation. Apart from defects in Wg and MAPK signaling, however, we did not observe altered wing patterning associated with other developmental signaling systems in EJC defective flies, arguing that EJC may primarily regulate Wg and MAPK signaling in patterning the developing wing."

Dsh, which acts as a hub mediating both canonical and non-canonical Wg signaling, however, is found at both the apical cell boundary and in the basal side of the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaplan and Tolwinski, 2010</a>). Thus, the polarized activity of Dsh must require distinct regulatory mechanisms at different sub-membrane compartments (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mlodzik, 2016</a>). Our results provide the in vivo evidence suggesting that the basolateral polarity determinant Dlg1 may play a dominant role to control the Dsh abundance/activity in canonical Wg signaling."

It is also reported that a tumor suppressor CYLD deubiquitinase inhibits the ubiquitination of Dvl (<a href=\"#bib72\">Tauriello et al., 2010</a>). As Dlg1 prevents Dsh from degradation in <i>Drosophila</i>, it is important to investigate if Dlg1 participates in a posttranslational regulatory network of Dvl to integrate endocytosis and autophagy. Furthermore, upregulation of <i>dvl2</i> and <i>dlg2</i> expression has been found in various forms of cancer as shown in the COSMIC database (<a href=\"#bib20\">Forbes et al., 2015</a>). The study of the interaction between Dlg1 and Dsh may aid the development of novel approaches to prevent or treat relevant diseases."

On the other hand, L(2)gl can regulate Dsh to maintain planar organization of the embryonic epidermis in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaplan and Tolwinski, 2010</a>). Despite the complex interaction between L(2)gl and Dsh, not much is known about mutual regulation between Dlg1 and Dsh.

Our results unveil another side of the relationship in which Dlg1 controls the turnover of Dsh to ensure developmental signal propagation. Apart from its apical localization at the cell boundary, Dsh is also found in the basal side of the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaplan and Tolwinski, 2010</a>).

It is well known that Wg/Wnt signaling controls cell polarity in distinct manner. Non-canonical signaling acts through cytoskeletal regulators to establish planar cell polarity (<a href=\"#bib83\">Yang and Mlodzik, 2015</a>). Canonical signaling may also directly affect apical-basal cell polarity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Karner et al., 2006</a>). On the other hand, disruption of epithelial cell polarity has a profound impact on protein endocytosis and recycling (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barbieri et al., 2016</a>), both of which are essential regulatory steps for signal activation and maintenance (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shivas et al., 2010</a>). Our results add another layer of complexity by which polarity determinants could contribute to cell signaling independent of their conventional roles in polarity establishment and maintenance. Interestingly, this mode of regulation is also observed for other signaling processes. Loss of Dlg5 impairs Sonic hedgehog-induced Gli2 accumulation at the ciliary tip in mouse fibroblast cells that may not rely on cell polarity regulation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chong et al., 2015</a>). Similarly, L(2)gl regulates Notch signaling via endocytosis, independent of its role in cell polarity (<a href=\"#bib51\">Parsons et al., 2014</a>). We believe that other cell polarity determinants may similarly participate in polarity-independent processes, however, the exact mechanism of how they cooperate to modulate developmental signaling awaits further investigation."

They also provide some evidence suggesting that this function of Dlg1 is independent from its well established role in cell polarity and that a mammalian orthologue of Dlg appears to play a conserved role in Wnt signaling by interacting with and stabilizing a mammalian homologue of Dsh."
