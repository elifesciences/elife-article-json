DNA G4 structures have been extensively studied, however, less is known about G4 motifs in mRNAs, especially in their coding sequences. Herein, we show that Aven stimulates the mRNA translation of the mixed lineage leukemia (<i>MLL</i>) proto-oncogene in an arginine methylation-dependent manner. The Aven RGG/RG motif bound G4 structures within the coding regions of the MLL1 and MLL4 mRNAs increasing their polysomal association and translation, resulting in the induction of transcription of leukemic genes. The DHX36 RNA helicase associated with the Aven complex and was required for optimal translation of G4 mRNAs. Depletion of Aven led to a decrease in synthesis of MLL1 and MLL4 proteins resulting in reduced proliferation of leukemic cells. These findings identify an Aven-centered complex that stimulates the translation of G4 harboring mRNAs, thereby promoting survival of leukemic cells."

DNA G4 structures have been extensively studied, however, less is known about G4 motifs in mRNAs, especially in their coding sequences. Herein, we show that Aven stimulates the mRNA translation of the mixed lineage leukemia (<i>MLL</i>) proto-oncogene in an arginine methylation-dependent manner. The Aven RGG/RG motif bound G4 structures within the coding regions of the MLL1 and MLL4 mRNAs increasing their polysomal association and translation, resulting in the induction of transcription of leukemic genes. The DHX36 RNA helicase associated with the Aven complex and was required for optimal translation of G4 mRNAs. Depletion of Aven led to a decrease in synthesis of MLL1 and MLL4 proteins resulting in reduced proliferation of leukemic cells. These findings identify an Aven-centered complex that stimulates the translation of G4 harboring mRNAs, thereby promoting survival of leukemic cells."

This binding increases the translation of these mRNAs, with translation occurring most efficiently when a particular enzyme called a helicase\u2014which remodels RNA\u2014also bound to Aven.

The RGG/RG motif is enriched in proteins associated with RNA and is a known RNA-binding interface (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib84\">Thandapani et al., 2013</a>). The RGG/RG motif, also called RGG box, was shown to bind RNA (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kiledjian and Dreyfuss, 1992</a>).

The association of Aven with polysomes was dependent on the arginine methylation of its RGG/RG motif and on the methyl-dependent interactions with the Tudor domains of SMN and TDRD3, previously shown to be associated with polysomes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Goulet et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Sanchez et al., 2013</a>). We identify Aven to be an RBP, as its RGG/RG motif bound G4 motifs in the ORFs of mRNAs encoding the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) family proteins MLL1 and MLL4. The RGG/RG motif of Aven also associated with the G4 RNA helicase, DHX36, and this helicase was required for optimal translation of Aven-regulated mRNAs. Furthermore, Aven-deficient T-ALL cell lines had reduced MLL1 and MLL4 protein levels, but not mRNA levels, which were paralleled by proliferation defects.

                                "text": "To identify the interactome of the RGG/RG motif of Aven, we used a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) approach to quantify protein complexes differentially associated with Aven and Aven\u0394RGG (<a href=\"#bib14\">Blagoev et al., 2003</a>). U2OS cells transfected with pcDNA3.1, FLAG-Aven, or FLAG-Aven\u0394RGG were light (L), medium (M), or heavy (H) SILAC labeled, respectively, and IP with anti-FLAG antibodies. The data were expressed as fold-enrichment of Aven over control (M/L) and Aven\u0394RGG over control (H/L). Aven was identified and quantified with high M/L and H/L ratios, while PRMT1 was only found with a high ratio M/L showing as expected that it associates with its RGG-containing substrates (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Of the 146 proteins enriched with Aven, but not Aven\u0394RGG, \u223c23% were ribosomal proteins and \u223c10% were RBPs, their association is likely RNA-dependent (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). These data suggested that Aven, but not Aven\u0394RGG, associates with ribosomal proteins and/or RNP complexes, thereby implying that Aven associates with ribosomes in an RGG/RG motif-dependent manner. To address this question, we first assessed whether endogenous Aven and PRMT1 associate with ribosomes by sedimenting cytoplasmic extracts on 5\u201350% sucrose gradients by ultracentrifugation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Subsequently, sucrose gradients were fractionated to separate cytoplasmic mRNPs, ribosomal subunits, monosomes, and polysomes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Gandin et al., 2014</a>), and the amount of Aven, PRMT1, rpS6 (ribosomal protein S6), and \u03b2-tubulin in each fraction was determined by immunoblotting. Aven and PRMT1 co-sedimented with the heavier polysomal fractions with rpS6, while \u03b2-tubulin was restricted to the lighter fractions of the sucrose gradient corresponding to cytoplasmic mRNP fractions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, fractions 11 to 16). To investigate whether the RGG/RG motif and its methylation regulates the recruitment of Aven to polysomes, we performed polysomal fractionation in HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG-Aven or FLAG-Aven\u0394RGG (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). FLAG-Aven co-sedimented with the heavier polysomal fractions, while FLAG-Aven\u0394RGG was more shifted towards the lighter fractions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>) and this was quantified (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These findings suggest that RGG/RG motif of Aven is required for its recruitment to polysomes. To further investigate the role of RGG/RG motif methylation in polysomal localization of Aven, the FLAG-Aven was co-transfected with siPRMT1, which reduced PRMT1 expression by \u223c2.7-fold (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similar to what has been reported in fission yeast (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bachand and Silver, 2004</a>), PRMT1 depletion did not have a major effect on the monosome/polysome ratio, thus, indicating that PRMT1 does not exert a major impact on global protein synthesis (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)<i>.</i> Nonetheless, PRMT1 depletion shifted FLAG-Aven into the lighter fractions, as compared to a control (compare <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, quantified in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We confirmed that Aven does not co-sediment with mRNPs other than polysomes by showing that puromycin, an aminonucleoside antibiotic that dissociates polysomes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Blobel and Sabatini, 1971</a>), leads to redistribution of both FLAG-Aven and rpS6 towards the lighter fractions corresponding to free ribosomal subunits, monosomes, and cytoplasmic mRNPs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Taken together, our findings suggest that the arginine methylation of the Aven RGG/RG motif by PRMT1 is required for the association of Aven with polysomes."

Some PG4 sequences identified encoded RG-rich sequences, as well as glycine-rich sequences. As Aven is a known survival protein and its depletion decreases the proliferation of leukemic cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Eismann et al., 2013</a>), we searched for mRNAs harboring PG4 sequences involved in leukemic cell survival. We identified human KMT2A, KMT2B, and KMT2D (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>), the family of MLL histone methyltransferases known to be mutated and/or part of fusion proteins, as the result of chromosomal translocations in leukemia (<a href=\"#bib57\">Liedtke and Cleary, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Smith et al., 2011</a>). KMT2A (MLL1) has a PG4 sequence (nucleotide 223\u2013253) that encodes a glycine-rich sequence (AGSSGAGVPGG, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; cG/cC score of 2.975, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>), KMT2B (MLL4) has 3 PG4 sequences (nucleotides 262\u2013287; 3139\u20133166; 6274\u20136301) that encode an RGG/RG motif (RVQRGRGRG, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; cG/cC score of 2.796, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>), a glycine-rich (RGAGAGGPRE; cG/cC score of 1.887, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>), an alanine-glycine-rich (RAGVLGAAGD; cG/cC score of 2.468, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>) sequences, and KMT2D has a PG4 from nucleotide 961 to 986 that encodes RVCRACGAG (cG/cC score of 2.029, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). We examined whether Aven associated with the conserved PG4 RNA sequences (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) of KMT2A (MLL1) and KMT2B (MLL4) near the initiator ATG (i.e., 223\u2013253 and 262\u2013287). Indeed, Aven bound either MLL1 or MLL4 PG4 RNA sequences in the RGG/RG motif-dependent manner, but not to those harboring guanine to adenine mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013F</a>). We next examined whether FLAG-Aven binds the endogenous MLL1 and MLL4 PG4 sequences in vivo using photocrosslinking with 4-thiouridine followed by immunoprecipitations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Cahill et al., 2002</a>) and treatment with RNase I to digest RNAs into fragments of 50\u2013300 nucleotides in length (<a href=\"#bib45\">Huppertz et al., 2014</a>). HEK293T transfected with pcDNA3.1, FLAG-Aven, or FLAG-Aven\u0394RGG were prepared for CLIP, as described in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and IP with anti-FLAG antibodies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations of FLAG-Aven expressing cells, but not pcDNA3.1 or FLAG-Aven\u0394RGG-transfected cells, enriched \u223c30-fold for the MLL4 G4 sequence, whereas an RNA region 300 nucleotides downstream was not enriched (noG4; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, right panel). MLL1 G4 sequence was also enriched (\u223cfivefold) in FLAG-Aven immunoprecipitations, but not a region without G4 motifs (noG4) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, left panel). We investigated whether endogenous Aven could associate with the PG4s of MLL1 and MLL4 mRNAs. Photocrosslinking immunoprecipitations assays confirmed that MLL1 and MLL4 PG4 sequences associated with IP endogenous Aven, but not immunoglobulin G control albeit with a lower affinity (\u223cfourfold to sixfold, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>) than with overexpressing FLAG-Aven (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>) and that ultraviolet light was required for this association (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). The fold induction observed between Aven and the G4 sequences is likely under represented due to the fact that the crosslinks impede the reverse transcription reactions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Huppertz et al., 2014</a>). These findings demonstrate that Aven is associated in vivo with the PG4s of MLL1 and MLL4."

A minor Aven \u223c34 kDa fragment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, denoted by asterisk) was observed in HEK293T cells and likely represents a Cathepsin D cleaved fragment reported previously (<a href=\"#bib61\">Melzer et al., 2012</a>). Aven depletion did not influence the number of ribosomes involved in polysomes, as compared to control (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), suggesting that general mRNA translation was not affected by Aven. However, a specific subset of mRNAs may still be particularly sensitive to changes in Aven levels. To investigate this possibility, we monitored the distribution of MLL1, MLL4, and \u03b2-actin mRNA in polysomal fractions from Aven-proficient and Aven-deficient cells. Polysomal fractions were isolated and MLL1, MLL4 mRNAs, as well as \u03b2-actin mRNA, were quantified by RT-qPCR.

Similarly, MLL4 mRNA was reduced in the heavy polysomal fraction (fractions 12\u201314) and a shift towards the light polysomal and pre-polysomal (fractions 7\u20138 and 10\u201311) (fractions 7\u20138).

The ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX36, also known as G4 resolvase I, had an M/H ratio of 2.69 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). DHX36 has been reported to unwind G4 RNA structures (<a href=\"#bib33\">Creacy et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Lattmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Booy et al., 2012</a>). We postulated that Aven could recruit the RNA helicases DHX36 to resolve G4 structures to facilitate protein synthesis. First, to validate whether the Aven RGG/RG motif is essential for interaction with the RNA helicase DHX36, we performed co-immunoprecipitations from cellular lysates expressing FLAG-Aven or FLAG-Aven\u0394RGG. The bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-DHX36 antibodies. Indeed, DHX36 co-IP with FLAG-Aven, but not with FLAG-Aven\u0394RGG (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Moreover, we observed that DHX36 localized in the fast-sedimenting, heavier polysomal fractions with the control rpS6 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, fractions 12\u201315). To examine whether DHX36 influences the polysomal localization of MLL1 and MLL4 mRNAs, we monitored their mRNAs in polysomal fractions. Consistently with the observations for Aven and PRMT1, DHX36 depletion in HEK293T cells did not have a major effect on polysome absorbance profiles, thus, indicating that DHX36 does not affect global protein synthesis (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). However, both MLL1 and MLL4, but not \u03b2-actin mRNA, shifted toward lighter polysomal fractions in cells depleted of DHX36, as compared to the control (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013F</a>). These findings suggest that similarly to PRMT1 and Aven, DHX36 regulates translation of MLL1 and MLL4 mRNAs."

We examined whether Aven could promote the translation of the luciferase reporter protein in a G4-dependent manner and whether this was rescued by Aven re-expression in Aven-deficient cells. pGL3, pGL3-MLL4, or pGL3-MLL4 G4 mutant were transfected in Aven<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> HEK293T cells with pRenilla, as a control for transfection efficiency, along with either pcDNA3.1, FLAG-Aven, FLAG-Aven\u0394RGG, or FLAG-AvenR-K.

In the present manuscript, we identify, within the mRNA-coding regions of MLL1 and MLL4, RNA elements that regulate its polysomal association and protein synthesis. These RNA elements are located between 200 and 300 nucleotides downstream of the initiator methionine ATG and encode protein sequences rich in glycines and arginine\u2013glycine repeats in MLL1 and MLL4. The function of these N-terminal repeats is unknown. We show that Aven binds the MLL1 and MLL4 G4 RNA structures in vitro and in vivo with its RGG/RG motif. Aven was required for the translational regulation of MLL1 and MLL4, as Aven-deficient T-ALL cells exhibited decreased MLL1 and MLL4 protein expression and consequently decreased the expression of their downstream targets including, the <i>HOX</i> genes. The association of Aven with polysomes required the methylation of its RGG/RG motif by PRMT1 and interaction with methyl-binding proteins, TDRD3 and SMN. The Aven interaction with TDRD3 and SMN may require other protein or RNA components in the complex for enhanced association. Deficiency of Aven or PRMT1 in acute leukemic cell lines led to decreased cell proliferation. Taken together, our studies suggest that Aven regulates the translation of MLL1 and MLL4 required for cancer survival and that targeting this pathway may have therapeutic potential."

The RGG/RG motif of yeast proteins Scd6, Npl3, and Sbp1 was shown to interact with the translational initiation factor eIF4G and repress translation by preventing the formation of pre-initiation complex (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rajyaguru et al., 2012</a>). In trypanosomes, the RGG/RG motif of SCD6 is involved in regulating the type and number of RNP granules (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kr\u00fcger et al., 2013</a>). Amyloid-like fibers were formed when the RGG/RG motif of FUS was incubated with RNA (<a href=\"#bib76\">Schwartz et al., 2013</a>). These fibers are characterized by the reversible transformation from soluble to polymeric state (<a href=\"#bib43\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kato et al., 2012</a>). Although many proteins have an RGG/RG motif, the Aven RGG/RG motif may be more accessible, as it is located at the N-terminus and may protrude outwards. Since the Aven RGG/RG motif is not required for self-association (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), this suggests that an Aven dimer has 2 protruding RGG/RG motifs that can each mediate their own interactions. Therefore, we speculate that Aven functions as a scaffolding protein to assemble translationally competent RNPs for certain mRNAs containing G4 motifs (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>)."

DHX36 knockdown increased the expression of PITX1 protein without changes in mRNA, suggesting that it functions in translational control (<a href=\"#bib18\">Booy et al., 2014</a>).

The <i>EEN</i> fusion partner leads to the recruitment of PRMT1 to methylate histones and lead to gene activation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Cheung et al., 2007</a>). Our findings identify a new role for PRMT1 in the cytoplasm that is required for cancer cell survival. This pathway is amenable to therapeutic intervention with future PRMT1 inhibitors and specific RNA G-quadruplex ligands."

Following this incubation, the final volume of each sample was adjusted to 20 \u00b5l such that the final concentrations were 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 100 mM LiCl or KCl. The reactions were then incubated for 40 hr at room temperature, ethanol-precipitated and the RNAs dissolved in formamide dye loading buffer (95% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.025% bromophenol blue). The radioactivity of the in-line probing samples was measured, and equal amounts in terms of desintegrations per minute of all conditions of each candidate were fractionated on denaturing (8 M urea) 10% polyacrylamide gels. The SAFA software was used to quantify each band. The intensity of the band incubated in KCl was then divided by the intensity of the corresponding band incubated with LiCl. G4 formation is confirmed when this value exceed 2 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Beaudoin and Perreault, 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2013</a>).

The authors present data supporting the role of Aven as an RNA binding protein through its N-terminal RGG/RG domain and suggest that it binds G-quadruplex RNA structures. Arginine methylation of the RGG/RG domain by PRMT1 was shown to affect RNA binding, association with polyribosomes, and interactions with two Tudor domain proteins (SMN and TDRD3). The authors identify G-quadruplex motifs in two mRNAs (MLL1 and MLL4) as targets of Aven. It also appears that the RGG/RG domain of Aven recruits an RNA helicase that can unwind G-quadruplexes (DHX36) to polyribosomes, and this increases the translation of mRNAs. Taken together the data suggest a model where Aven binds the G-quadruplex motifs in the MLL mRNAs, through its RGG/RG domain. It associates with polysomes dependent on methylation of its RGG/RG domain by PRMT1, and its binding to polysome-associated Tudor domain proteins. Polysome-associated Aven recruits a GQ-unwinding helicase that then promotes translation of MLL1 and MLL4 by destabilizing the G-quadruplexes in their coding sequences. Increased expression of these histone methyltransferases affects transcription of HOX mRNAs and this is associated with the increased cell proliferation and survival function postulated for Aven."

This is extended in (B) and (C) to the capture of endogenous TDRD3 and SMN and finally in (D) co-IP of endogenous Aven with endogenous TDRD3 and SMN is shown, and found to be dependent on OHT treatment. The authors suggest this means it's dependent on methylation of Aven by PRMT1 but dependence on PRMT1 is not shown. Further support for this would be OHT treated WT MEFS, or a second method of knocking down PRMT1, like siPRMT1 treatment. There is nothing in these studies to rule out complex formation via a third protein(s) or RNA that links Aven to the other two proteins, for example, if they are all polysome-associated, and intact polysomes are being IPed. RNAse treatment would be appropriate here. Note that sc1 is not a substitute for the RNAs that Aven might be interacting with in a cell."

Why does rpS6 disappear completely with puromycin treatment? It should appear in the fractions with the monosome peak. Quantitation of the loss from polysomes with error bars would be appropriate to make the point here. In (K-M) the same concerns apply.

I am not clear about the reasoning behind or the significance of the statement that the mRNA encoding domains rich in R's and G's may have propensity to form G-quadruplexes. Nor why that particular consensus was used to query ORFs for potential G-quadruplex forming sequences. Is there literature to support that that query predicts that RNA fold? The rationale should be made clear. I'm particularly worried about the inclusion of C's without restraints in the N1-7 intervals. A stretch of C's will almost certainly form a duplex with nearby runs of G's interrupting the potential for GQ formation. A folding program could supplement this analysis, as could conservation across species that would predict maintenance of the GQ fold. Compensatory mutation to preserve folding would be even stronger evidence. If it's correct that the C-terminus of Aven holds the anti-apoptotic function once released from the N-terminus, it's not clear why the authors are proposing the connection between PG4 binding in mRNAs encoding proteins involved in leukemic cell survival. Could the authors please comment on the findings in Melzer et al. (Cell Death and Differentiation, 19:1435, 2012)?"

It should not be referred to as \u201cCLIP\u201d in the current form, since there is no attempt to take advantage of the covalent bond introduced by crosslinking which would include rigorous purification of Aven:RNA complexes including stringent washes and SDS-PAGE. Moreover, this is PAR-CLIP, not iCLIP as referenced. The reference should be changed to the methodology developed by the Tuschl lab. An unbiased map of where Aven is bound to RNA in vivo could be obtained by performing the whole CLIP protocol including high throughput sequencing of the RNA tags. However, overexpression of Aven with a Flag tag is not optimal, as RBPs tend to associate with targets of lesser affinity and specificity when overexpressed beyond normal stoichiometry with their RNA targets. The antibody against Aven could be used to perform CLIP on endogenous Aven with unbiased and more comprehensive results."

The conclusion is made that the Aven-null cells have less polysomes, but it appears that they have less total ribosomes as well since the monosome peak is decreased. If equal cell numbers were used for the polysome analysis this might suggest a decrease in the total machinery available for protein synthesis. Panels (C)-(F) show the results for only part of the gradient. It would be valuable to see the whole gradient. Moreover, mRNA per fraction can only be plotted as a percentage of the total RNA if the total is determined for the whole gradient. For example, in (C) a large increase in MLL1 mRNA in the WT (blue line) in fractions 1-4 could cause the blue line in fractions 13-14 to actually be less than the red line, which changes the conclusions. If the authors mean that they quantified the mRNA in an aliquot of the lysate applied to the gradient, this should be clarified. For less confusion, real values for each fraction should be shown rather than percentage, which makes the assumption that the total mRNA levels in the presence or absence of Aven are unchanged.

The background to the paper is that the authors previously found that Aven harbors an N-terminal RGG motif conserved across species. It strikes me that the most important issue, before investigating its function, should be to show that the RGG box is required for the anti-apoptotic (or other) biological functions of Aven in affecting cancer progression. Once established, it then becomes of greater interest to understand the molecular functions of the RGG box. My reading of the paper is that those assays haven't been done and in terms of the ones that have been performed, deletion of the RGG box had no effect. Moreover, as I pointed out in my first review, Melzer et al. have published that the anti-apoptotic function of Aven resides in the C-terminus and the N-terminus (containing the RGG box) acts to repress this activity until cleavage of Aven by cathepsin D releases the active C-terminus. I think this at odds with the idea that the RGG box is central to the anti-apoptotic activity unless I'm missing something. I asked the authors to discuss this and they didn't answer the question. They do add a sentence or two to the paper (in addition to agreeing to mention the Melzer et al. work) in which they say they can barely detect the product of cathepsin D cleavage, therefore it's unlikely to be important to what they are studying, but that doesn't address the issue of demonstrating that the N-terminal RGG box is actually required for the anti-apoptotic properties of Aven."

The binding sites would not only reveal mRNA targets but would show GQ motif consensus if that's really the in vivo binding site for Aven. The polysome-association and PRMT1 methylation studies then follow to determine the outcome of Aven binding those sites in those mRNAs (which may or may not be translational control) as well as what regulates it. Instead, the paper reads like a very biased expedition to explore a few reported properties of RGG boxes and RNA G-quadruplexes based on prior literature, not all of which is high quality and many conclusions are from in vitro studies with unclear in vivo relevance. I realize we previously discussed this and agreed that it would be unreasonable to ask them to do these experiments (though it does bother me that they have already done half the PAR-CLIP experiment but didn't finish it, which could transform their paper (or prove their assertions correct) fairly easily)."

What I wanted the Richard group to discuss is the Melzer et al. finding that the RGG-box containing N-terminus of Aven mediates homodimerization, and that its release from FL Aven by cathepson D cleavage activates the C-terminus as an anti-apoptotic molecule.

There is a small decrease in the ability of Aven to do so if the RGG box is deleted but it is only significant at the highest UV dose and is a modest effect, perhaps 2-fold. Panel B shows a Western blot of the expression of Aven and Aven-\u0394RGG and it is quite clear that there's much more WT Aven produced than Aven-\u0394RGG. It is impossible to know if the effects they see are due to Aven dose or to the RGG box. CRISPR-mediated deletion of the RGG box from endogenous Aven would be more compelling.

Panels (C)-(F) show the results for only part of the gradient. It would be valuable to see the whole gradient. Moreover, mRNA per fraction can only be plotted as a percentage of the total RNA if the total is determined for the whole gradient. For example, in (C) a large increase in MLL1 mRNA in the WT (blue line) in fractions 1-4 could cause the blue line in fractions 13-14 to actually be less than the red line, which changes the conclusions. If the authors mean that they quantified the mRNA in an aliquot of the lysate applied to the gradient, this should be clarified.

Therefore, based on the data presented in our present study, we are undertaking genome-wide PAR-CLIP experiments from total and polysomal extracts, wherein in parallel we are performing ribosome profiling study to identify not just mRNAs that are AVEN bound, but also those whose polysome-association and translation are regulated by AVEN.
