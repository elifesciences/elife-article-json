                    "text": "Information about nutrient availability is assessed via largely unknown mechanisms to drive developmental decisions, including the choice of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> larvae to enter into the reproductive cycle or the dauer stage. In this study, we show that CMK-1 CaMKI regulates the dauer decision as a function of feeding state. CMK-1 acts cell-autonomously in the ASI, and non cell-autonomously in the AWC, sensory neurons to regulate expression of the growth promoting <i>daf-7</i> TGF-\u03b2 and <i>daf-28</i> insulin-like peptide (ILP) genes, respectively. Feeding state regulates dynamic subcellular localization of CMK-1, and CMK-1-dependent expression of anti-dauer ILP genes, in AWC. A food-regulated balance between anti-dauer ILP signals from AWC and pro-dauer signals regulates neuroendocrine signaling and dauer entry; disruption of this balance in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants drives inappropriate dauer formation under well-fed conditions. These results identify mechanisms by which nutrient information is integrated in a small neuronal network to modulate neuroendocrine signaling and developmental plasticity."

In this study, we show that CMK-1 CaMKI regulates the dauer decision as a function of feeding state. CMK-1 acts cell-autonomously in the ASI, and non cell-autonomously in the AWC, sensory neurons to regulate expression of the growth promoting <i>daf-7</i> TGF-\u03b2 and <i>daf-28</i> insulin-like peptide (ILP) genes, respectively. Feeding state regulates dynamic subcellular localization of CMK-1, and CMK-1-dependent expression of anti-dauer ILP genes, in AWC. A food-regulated balance between anti-dauer ILP signals from AWC and pro-dauer signals regulates neuroendocrine signaling and dauer entry; disruption of this balance in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants drives inappropriate dauer formation under well-fed conditions. These results identify mechanisms by which nutrient information is integrated in a small neuronal network to modulate neuroendocrine signaling and developmental plasticity."

For example, when conditions are favorable, the larvae of the tiny roundworm <i>C. elegans</i> rapidly mature into adults and reproduce. However, when faced with starvation, over-crowding or other adverse conditions, they can stop growing and enter a type of stasis called the dauer stage, which enables them to survive in harsh conditions for extended periods of time. The worms enter the dauer stage if they detect high levels of a pheromone mixture that is produced by other worms\u2014which indicates that the local population is over-crowded. However, temperature, food availability, and other environmental cues also influence this decision."

These proteins usually promote the growth of the worms by increasing the production of particular steroid hormones. However, high levels of the pheromone mixture, an inadequate supply of food and other adverse conditions decrease the expression of the genes that encode these proteins, which allows the worm to enter the dauer state. It is not clear how the worm senses food, nor how this is integrated with the information provided by the pheromones to influence this decision."

The experiments show that worms missing a protein called CaMKI enter the dauer state even under conditions in which food is plentiful and normal worms continue to grow. CaMKI inhibits entry into the dauer stage by increasing the expression of the genes that encode TGF-\u03b2 and the insulin-like peptides in sensory neurons in response to food."

Well-described polyphenic traits include the exhibition of wings on locusts, caste hierarchy in social insects, and environmental sex determination in reptiles (<a href=\"#bib67\">Nijhout, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Beldade et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Simpson et al., 2011</a>). In well-studied cases as in insects, it has been shown that animals integrate sensory cues during specific developmental stages to promote the expression of alternate phenotypic traits via regulation of endocrine and neuromodulatory signaling (<a href=\"#bib90\">Simpson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Watanabe et al., 2014</a>). Environmental cues that trigger developmental plasticity include pheromones, temperature, mechanical stimuli, and food (<a href=\"#bib67\">Nijhout, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Simpson et al., 2011</a>). In particular, nutrient availability and quality during development is a major regulator of polyphenism in many species (<a href=\"#bib104\">Wheeler, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Greene, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Pfennig, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bento et al., 2010</a>). Although the extent and adaptive value of polyphenism has been extensively discussed (<a href=\"#bib74\">Pfennig et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Moczek et al., 2011</a>), the underlying molecular and neuronal mechanisms that allow animals to sense and integrate signals from food and feeding-state signals in the context of other cues to regulate phenotypic plasticity are not fully understood."

Shortly following hatching, <i>C. elegans</i> larvae assess crowding in their environment via concentrations of a complex mixture of small molecules called ascarosides (collectively referred to as dauer pheromone) produced by conspecifics (<a href=\"#bib36\">Golden and Riddle, 1982</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">1984c</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Jeong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Butcher et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Edison, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Ludewig and Schroeder, 2013</a>). High concentrations of one or more of these chemicals promote entry of larvae into the alternate stress-resistant and long-lived dauer developmental stage, whereas under uncrowded conditions, larvae continue in the reproductive cycle (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cassada and Russell, 1975</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Although pheromone is the instructive cue for dauer entry, additional cues, such as temperature and food availability, also regulate this binary decision (<a href=\"#bib37\">Golden and Riddle, 1984a</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">1984b</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">1984c</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ailion and Thomas, 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Thus, high (low) concentrations of food or low (high) temperature can efficiently inhibit (promote) pheromone-induced dauer formation, allowing animals to assess and integrate diverse sensory cues in order to make a robust developmental choice."

Expression of the <i>daf-7</i> TGF-\u03b2 and <i>daf-28</i> ILP genes are downregulated in well-fed <i>cmk-1</i> mutants, and we find that CMK-1 acts cell-autonomously in the ASI sensory neurons, and non cell-autonomously in the AWC sensory neurons, to regulate the expression of <i>daf-7</i> and <i>daf-28</i>, respectively. We show that the subcellular localization of CMK-1 in AWC is feeding state-dependent, and that CMK-1 promotes expression of anti-dauer ILP genes in AWC. Our results indicate that a balance of CMK-1-regulated anti-dauer signals from AWC, as well as pro-dauer signals, regulates dauer entry as a function of feeding state, and that this balance is disrupted in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants to inappropriately promote dauer entry under well-fed conditions. We also find that basal activity levels in AWC are enhanced upon prolonged starvation in wild-type animals and in well-fed <i>cmk-1</i> mutants, and that increased activity acts in parallel with CMK-1 to antagonize dauer formation. Together, these results identify CMK-1 CaMKI as a key molecule that encodes information about nutrient availability within a sensory neuron network to regulate neuroendocrine signaling and a polyphenic developmental choice."

We could not reliably examine the effects of heat-killed bacteria in this assay since <i>cmk-1</i> mutants exited the dauer stage prematurely under these conditions (not shown), possibly due to additional metabolic defects that we have not explored further in this study. Increasing the amount of live food to 320 \u03bcg decreased but did not fully suppress dauer formation in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), implying that these animals are able to respond to food, but exhibit a shifted threshold of response to feeding. Consistent with the notion that <i>cmk-1</i> mutants retain the ability to respond to food cues, egg-laying was modulated by bacterial food in both wild-type and <i>cmk-1(oy21)</i> adult animals (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

However, expression of wild-type <i>cmk-1</i> sequences in the ASI/AWA or AWC sensory neurons resulted in partial, and nearly complete, suppression of dauer formation, respectively. Expression of <i>cmk-1</i> in both ASI/AWA and AWC suppressed dauer formation to the same extent as expression in AWC alone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

We further explored the role of CMK-1 in AWC in the regulation of dauer formation as a function of feeding state. We and others previously showed that CMK-1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in thermosensory neurons based on growth temperature (<a href=\"#bib88\">Schild et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Yu et al., 2014</a>), and regulates the expression of thermotransduction genes (<a href=\"#bib106\">Yu et al., 2014</a>). We asked whether CMK-1 subcellular localization in AWC is similarly affected by feeding status. In fed L1 larvae, a functional CMK-1::GFP fusion protein was present mostly uniformly throughout the soma of the AWC neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Food withdrawal for 30 min resulted in a transient nuclear enrichment of CMK-1 that persisted for approximately 1 hr (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). However, after prolonged starvation, CMK-1::GFP was enriched in the cytoplasm of AWC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). In contrast, food did not affect subcellular localization of CMK-1::GFP in AFD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), and we previously showed that temperature does not affect CMK-1 localization in AWC (<a href=\"#bib106\">Yu et al., 2014</a>). Overexpression of a constitutively nuclear-enriched CMK-1::GFP protein in AWC strongly rescued the dauer formation phenotype of <i>cmk-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>), whereas a constitutively cytoplasmically enriched protein rescued more weakly (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The subcellular localization of these proteins in AWC was unaffected by genotype or feeding state (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, we note that neither the nuclear-enriched nor the cytoplasmically enriched CMK-1::GFP fusion proteins are fully excluded from the cytoplasmic or nuclear compartment, respectively, possibly due to overexpression (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that feeding state regulates CMK-1 subcellular localization in AWC, and that CMK-1 activity in the nuclei of AWC may be important to encode food information in the dauer regulatory pathway."

Relative to wild-type, <i>ins-26</i>p<i>::yfp</i> expression was decreased in ASE and AWC in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants grown with plentiful food, whereas expression in ASI decreased only upon starvation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Similarly, <i>ins-35</i>p<i>::yfp</i> was largely expressed in ASE and AWC in fed wild-type L1 larvae; expression in both neurons was significantly decreased upon starvation, and in fed and starved <i>cmk-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Weak expression of <i>ins-35</i> was also observed in the ASK neurons, particularly in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants, although expression in this neuron type was not further modulated by starvation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Expression of a constitutively nuclear-enriched CMK-1 protein in AWC neurons increased <i>ins-35</i> expression in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants in both fed and starved conditions, to a slightly greater extent than a constitutively cytoplasmically enriched protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These observations suggest that the expression of <i>ins-26</i> and <i>ins-35</i> in AWC is regulated by food availability, and that their expression pattern in AWC in fed <i>cmk-1</i> mutants resembles that of starved wild-type animals. Moreover, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of CMK-1 may be important for feeding state-dependent regulation of <i>ins-35</i> gene expression."

In turn, changes in gene expression feed back to regulate neuronal state and properties. We asked whether AWC activity is altered upon starvation or in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants. It has previously been shown that the AWC neurons in adult animals are silenced in the presence of food or food-related odorants and are activated upon food/odor withdrawal (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>). Consistent with this observation, the AWC neurons of well-fed wild-type L2 larvae expressing the GCaMP calcium indicator (<a href=\"#bib64\">Nakai et al., 2001</a>) exhibited few, if any somatic calcium transients (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). However, we found that wild-type AWC neurons became hyperactive following prolonged food deprivation. Both the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous calcium transients increased upon starvation for 2 hr, although no effects were observed after 1 hr (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Interestingly, the AWC neurons in well-fed <i>cmk-1</i> mutant larvae exhibited a high frequency and amplitude of somatic calcium transients similar to the activity pattern observed in starved wild-type larvae (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>); activity in AWC in <i>cmk-1</i> larvae was not further increased by starvation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Overexpression of wild-type <i>cmk-1</i> sequences in AWC suppressed basal GCaMP expression (data not shown), implying that AWC may be silenced under these conditions, and precluded examination of cell-specific effects of CMK-1 on AWC activity."

Confirming this observation, we found that removal of either of the attractive odorants isoamyl alcohol or benzaldehyde following a 1 min exposure failed to elicit a response in the AWC neurons of wild-type adult animals transferred directly from food, but led to responses in animals starved on a food-free plate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since the activity state of AWC in fed <i>cmk-1</i> mutants resembles that of starved wild-type animals, we asked whether AWC neurons in <i>cmk-1</i> mutant adults are able to respond to odor removal without prior starvation. Indeed, the AWC neurons in <i>cmk-1</i> adult animals responded robustly to odorant removal regardless of their feeding state (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together, these observations imply that the basal activity state of the AWC neurons in fed <i>cmk-1</i> mutants is similar to the activity state of these neurons in wild-type animals starved for extended periods.

We have identified AWC as key neurons that translate food information into changes in <i>daf-28</i> ILP gene expression to regulate dauer formation. Our results suggest a model in which the AWC neurons transmit both anti- and pro-dauer signals; the balance between these signals is determined by food inputs and feeding state to regulate a critical developmental decision in the nematode life cycle. We show that the anti-dauer signals are comprised in part of the AWC-expressed <i>ins-26</i> and <i>ins-35</i> ILP genes, whereas the <i>ins-32</i> ILP gene may constitute a component of the pro-dauer signal (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Expression of <i>ins-26</i> and <i>ins-35</i> in AWC is downregulated under starvation conditions that promote dauer formation, and loss of both genes enhances dauer formation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

Live and heat-killed bacteria provide different signals which may be sensed and integrated by distinct networks in the dauer decision. Thus, integration of different food signals from diverse sensory neurons likely differentially influences dauer formation on different food types. Indeed, ASI detects food directly to regulate <i>daf-7</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib78\">Ren et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Schackwitz et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Gallagher et al., 2013</a>), and recent work has shown that complex patterns and shapes of expression of <i>daf-7</i> and the <i>tph-1</i> tryptophan hydroxylase genes across multiple neuron types represents a \u2018neural code\u2019 for food abundance in the context of regulation of adult lifespan (<a href=\"#bib25\">Entchev et al., 2015</a>). Given the consequences of phenotypic plasticity on fitness (<a href=\"#bib67\">Nijhout, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Avery, 2014</a>), the precise tuning of anti- and pro-dauer signals in multiple neurons, including the AWC neurons, is critical to allow animals to make the optimal developmental decision in response to specific environmental conditions."

Second, the expression patterns of <i>daf-7</i> in ASI and <i>daf-28</i> in ASJ in fed <i>cmk-1</i> mutants are similar to those in starved wild-type animals, indicating that the expression of these key dauer-regulatory hormones does not reflect food abundance accurately in the absence of CMK-1. Third, expression of <i>ins-26</i> and <i>ins-35</i> ILP genes in AWC in fed <i>cmk-1</i> mutants resembles those in starved wild-type animals, further supporting the notion that food signals and gene expression patterns are uncoupled in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Overexpression of <i>ins-26</i> and <i>ins-35</i> from AWC, and loss of <i>ins-32</i> suppress the enhanced dauer formation phenotype of <i>cmk-1</i> mutants indicating that the altered balance between anti-dauer and pro-dauer signals together with decreased <i>daf-7</i> expression in ASI, sensitizes the threshold for dauer formation in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants. Consistent with the notion that this balance is disproportionately shifted towards increased pro-dauer signals from AWC in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants, ablation of AWC suppresses increased dauer formation and partially restores <i>daf-28</i>p<i>::gfp</i> expression in this background. It is important to note, however, that the expression pattern changes in fed <i>cmk-1</i> mutants are not identical to those in starved wild-type animals, indicating that additional mechanisms translate food abundance into changes in gene expression patterns."

We report that the subcellular localization of CMK-1 in AWC is highly dynamic and feeding state-dependent. Starvation results in transient nuclear localization of CMK-1, followed by cytoplasmic enrichment upon prolonged food deprivation. Although we do not yet know the nature of the signal that triggers the initial nuclear translocation, neuronal activity has been shown in multiple contexts to regulate subcellular localization of both mammalian and <i>C. elegans</i> CaMKI (<a href=\"#bib27\">Eto et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Ueda et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Sakagami et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Schild et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Yu et al., 2014</a>). Since the AWC neurons must be transiently starved to exhibit responses to odorant removal, one possibility is that this odor removal-induced depolarization promotes CMK-1 nuclear translocation."

We show that constitutive nuclear localization of CMK-1 is sufficient to suppress dauer formation in the <i>cmk-1</i> background and increase <i>ins-35</i> expression under both fed and starved conditions. An intriguing possibility is that CMK-1 initially upregulates anti-dauer signals such as <i>ins-26</i> and <i>ins-35</i> upon transient food removal. As food deprivation persists, CMK-1 moves into the cytoplasm resulting in downregulation of anti-dauer signals to promote dauer formation. CMK-1 may also upregulate pro-dauer signals from AWC. Alternatively, pro-dauer signals may be expressed and/or released tonically, and CMK-1-mediated regulation of anti-dauer signals may be sufficient to promote or inhibit dauer formation. <i>C. elegans</i> larvae integrate food signals over an extended period of time to allow accurate assessment of their past, current, and future environment (<a href=\"#bib87\">Schaedel et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Avery, 2014</a>). We speculate that not only food abundance but also temporal variability in food availability must be encoded in the balance of anti- and pro-dauer signals. Such mechanisms would allow larvae to ignore relatively transient fluctuations in environmental cues and ensure that irreversible commitment to the dauer stage occurs only under persistently adverse conditions."

In wild-type animals, increased AWC activity upon prolonged starvation may be a consequence of feedback from internal state. Similar modulation of peripheral sensory neuron responses as a function of feeding state has been suggested to underlie state-dependent plasticity in sensory behaviors in other organisms (<a href=\"#bib49\">Jyotaki et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Palouzier-Paulignan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Sengupta, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Pool and Scott, 2014</a>). In starved wild-type animals, or in the absence of CMK-1 function, this state-dependent feedback may increase AWC activity, and this increased activity in turn, may antagonize dauer formation by regulating an as yet uncharacterized pathway that acts in parallel to the CMK-1 regulated pathway in AWC. Why would animals need to continue to antagonize dauer formation even following prolonged starvation? Pre-dauer L2d larvae integrate environmental cues from 16 hr\u201333 hr post hatching and make an irreversible commitment to dauer entry only after 33 hr (<a href=\"#bib87\">Schaedel et al., 2012</a>). Given this long timeframe of sensory signal integration, and that entry into the dauer stage is a bet-hedging strategy that maximizes fitness under uncertain environmental conditions (<a href=\"#bib23\">DeWitt and Scheiner, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Avery, 2014</a>), the availability of multiple dauer-regulatory pathways that integrate environmental cues on different timescales may be critical to correctly promote or suppress the dauer decision. A goal for the future will be to define how activity in AWC modulates dauer formation, to identify the circuit mechanisms by which AWC activity is altered as a function of starvation, and to correlate temporal changes in AWC activity with commitment to the dauer stage."

The similarity in expression changes that are also observed in wild type animals under starvation conditions lead the authors to suggest that CMK-1 functions in a food-dependent manner to regulate neuroendocrine responses. However, this basic narrative is at odds with the strong evidence provided by the authors that in the <i>cmk-1</i> mutant, there is an aberrant AWC neuronal state that gives rise to the production of pro-dauer signals. Genetic ablation of the AWC neurons suppresses the <i>cmk-1</i> dauer phenotype (while ablation of AWC, if anything, enhances dauer formation in wild type animals, under the specific assay conditions employed). This casts considerable doubt on the functional relevance of the data on the <i>ins</i>-26 and <i>ins</i>-35 peptides, and moreover, suggests that instead of relaying food-dependent signals to the <i>C. elegans</i> nervous system, CMK-1 may have an essential role in maintaining the function of AWC."

Might ablation of AWC also suppress the diminished <i>daf-28</i>::GFP expression observed in the ASJ neurons of the <i>cmk-1</i> mutant?

That is, if the absence of CMK-1 simply gives rise to dysfunctional AWC neurons that produce increased levels of pro-dauer signals, then it is more difficult to infer, based on the genetic analysis alone, a pivotal physiological role for CMK-1 in the expression of neuroendocrine signals in response to food."

The authors show that wild type worms on live bacteria, in the presence of presumably high doses of pheromones (ascr#3 and 5), can form dauers, allowing them to show that the ablation of AWC can suppress dauer formation in wild type animals, and thus implying that AWC generates pro-dauer signals under physiological conditions, in a manner that appears to be particularly inducible by/sensitive to pheromone levels. The authors indicate these pro-dauer signals. They then go a step further and provide evidence that <i>ins-32</i> may even be this signal-function, in parallel to the original and overriding subject of their manuscript, which is that CMK-1 regulates both ILP expression to modulate <i>daf-28</i> levels in ASJ, as well as <i>daf-7</i> levels in ASI. Given the relatively large effects of removing <i>daf-7</i> and ASI on dauer formation, compared with the modest effects of removing <i>daf-28</i>, genetically dissecting the contribution of AWC signalling to the <i>cmk-1</i> phenotype was not straightforward, but the authors have put together a thoughtful explanation of how CMK-1 functions as part of the sensorineural response to food to modulate entry into dauer diapause. The authors show that the intriguing elevated basal activity of the AWC neurons in the <i>cmk-1</i> mutant, which partially mimic what the authors see upon starvation, essentially attenuates dauer formation; importantly this is shown in wild type animals, as the authors use the HisCl1 system to show that dauer formation is enhanced in both wild type and <i>cmk-1</i> mutant backgrounds on live food (and pheromone). I would add that the meaning of this elevated basal activity remains to be determined, but the observation is quite striking! The authors provide an accompanying text that is precise in stating what has been shown and what has not been shown, which builds a credible case that CMK-1 functions in at least two different pairs of neurons to regulate a feeding state-dependent developmental decision."

We have now made this point clear in the model presented in revised <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. We also expect that multiple ILPs may signal to ASJ, complicating interpretation of the dauer phenotypes of ASJ-specific <i>daf-2</i> knockdown.

As we reported previously, we observed that dauer formation is indeed enhanced in wild-type animals grown on heat-killed food (current <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). However, dauer formation is instead suppressed in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants grown on live food (current <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), indicating that AWC also produces a pro-dauer signal.

We realized that wild-type AWC neurons could also send a pro-dauer signal, but this signal may be masked by the different food conditions (heat-killed vs. live food) employed to examine dauer formation in wild-type and <i>cmk-1</i> mutants, respectively. Dauer assays for <i>cmk-1</i> mutants are performed on live food since they rapidly exit dauer on heat-killed food. Wild-type animals do not generally form dauers on live food allowing us to demonstrate the shifted food sensitivity threshold for <i>cmk-1</i> mutants. However, live vs. heat-killed food provide different signals which may be sensed and integrated by distinct networks in the dauer decision, potentially confounding comparisons between wild-type and <i>cmk-1</i> mutants."

Consistent with this result, we also find that as in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants, ablation of AWC increases <i>daf-28</i>p<i>::gfp</i> expression in ASJ in wild-type animals grown on live food (new <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Together, these observations indicate that AWC sends both a pro- and anti-dauer signal even in wild-type animals, with the balance between these signals being regulated by food and feeding state, and that this feeding state-dependent balance is disrupted in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants.

We noted previously that this pro-dauer candidate was likely to be a target of the BLI-4 proprotein convertase. Of the 19 predicted BLI-4 ILP targets (10), only <i>ins-32</i> was shown to be expressed in AWC in adult hermaphrodites (11). We have now shown (new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), that mutations in <i>ins-32</i> not only suppress the enhanced dauer formation phenotype of <i>cmk-1</i> mutants, but that they also inhibit dauer formation in wild-type animals on both live and heat-killed food. These new results imply that <i>ins-32</i> is a candidate for the pro-dauer signal from AWC, and further imply that a balance between CMK-1-regulated anti- and pro-dauer signals from AWC regulate dauer formation."

As suggested by the reviewer, we asked whether suppression of AWC activity (not ablation) modifies dauer formation in wild-type and <i>cmk-1</i> mutants. If the aberrant activity in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants was causal to their increased dauer formation phenotype, we might expect that inhibition of this activity would suppress dauer formation in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants but may not affect dauer formation in wild-type animals."

This result suggests that increased AWC activity upon prolonged starvation in wild-type animals, or in <i>cmk-1</i> mutants, antagonizes dauer formation. Moreover, since reducing activity enhances dauer formation similarly in both wild-type and <i>cmk-1</i> mutants, these results also indicate that increased activity acts in parallel with the CMK-1 pathway to limit dauer formation."
