In this study, we address how evolutionary divergence in sensory perception relates to the physiological coding of stimuli. Mormyrid fishes that can detect subtle variations in electric communication signals encode signal waveform into spike-timing differences between sensory receptors. In contrast, the receptors of species insensitive to waveform variation produce spontaneously oscillating potentials. We found that oscillating receptors respond to electric pulses by resetting their phase, resulting in transient synchrony among receptors that encodes signal timing and location, but not waveform. These receptors were most sensitive to frequencies found only in the collective signals of groups of conspecifics, and this was correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. Thus, different perceptual capabilities correspond to different receptor physiologies. We hypothesize that these divergent mechanisms represent adaptations for different social environments. Our findings provide the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony."

Recently, we documented a striking example of evolutionary change in the electrosensory systems of weakly electric fish (<a href=\"#bib17\">Carlson et al., 2011</a>). Anatomical modifications of sensory receptors and the associated brain pathway that processes electric communication signals resulted in a newfound ability to detect subtle variations in these signals. This perceptual expansion led to a dramatic increase in the rates of signal evolution and species diversification.

These phase resets did not encode pulse waveform, explaining why species with oscillating receptors cannot behaviorally discriminate EOD waveform variation.

The differential electrode allowed us to record local field potentials resulting from the combined oscillations of multiple receptors. If the receptors near our electrodes were oscillating independently at different frequencies, we should see beats, or amplitude modulations, in the field potentials due to constructive and destructive interference. Indeed, beats were present in these recordings (see example in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), indicating that our electrode was in fact recording activity from multiple sources with different frequencies. Accordingly, at least three distinct peaks were present in the power spectrum of this recording (black trace in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Recording activity at a position 2 mm posterior to this location led to the loss of two of these peaks and the addition of two new peaks, suggesting that the electrode was recording activity from a distinct, but overlapping population of receptors compared to the previous location (red traces in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). Qualitatively similar results were seen in differential recordings from additional rosettes. Therefore, in agreement with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib29\">Harder, 1968b</a>), oscillatory activity of individual receptors is not correlated within or across rosettes."

This phase difference was constant regardless of pulse duration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L</a>). To determine whether oscillating receptors could encode pulse duration in a manner similar to the spike-timing differences of spiking receptors, we measured the difference in times of oscillatory peaks evoked by opposite-polarity pulses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). For pulse durations exceeding receptors' intrinsic oscillation periods (\u223c0.5 ms), the phase could be reset in response to each stimulus edge. In these instances, we measured the oscillation-timing difference elicited by the onset of a positive-polarity pulse and the offset of a negative-polarity pulse. However, pulses of shorter durations did not elicit phase resets to each stimulus edge, since these durations are shorter than receptors' intrinsic oscillation periods. For these stimulus durations, we measured the oscillation-timing differences after stimulus offset (e.g., <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Oscillation-timing differences did not accurately encode pulse durations shorter than \u223c1 ms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>), reflecting phase resets to the leading edge of the pulse that differ by \u223c180\u00b0 regardless of pulse duration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F,L</a>). This means that oscillatory responses could not encode pulse durations found in conspecific EODs (black bar in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). Therefore, species with oscillating receptors cannot behaviorally detect waveform variation at least in part because the precise timing cues are not encoded at the periphery. However, oscillating receptors would be able to encode the location of the stimulus based on which receptors reset to a peak first, owing to differences in stimulus polarity."

At the shortest intervals tested, the stimulus artifact of the second pulse obscured the oscillatory response to the first pulse (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Thus, to investigate how oscillating receptors encode IPIs, we measured interoscillation intervals as the time between the first oscillatory peak following a single-pulse stimulus and the first oscillatory peak following the second pulse in the paired stimulus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). This method was equivalent to measuring the time interval between oscillatory peaks evoked by each pulse in the pair, but it allowed us to measure the interoscillation intervals at the shortest IPIs where the oscillatory response was obscured by stimulus artifact. Interoscillation intervals accurately represented the IPI for intervals of \u223c1 ms and longer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,G</a>).

Phase resets in oscillatory receptors serve to transiently synchronize the population in response to a stimulus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Because oscillation frequency varies across receptors, responses rapidly desynchronize (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). For instance, in response to a single square pulse, across-receptor synchrony is greatest for the first poststimulus oscillatory peak (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In response to a pair of pulses, across-receptor synchrony is high immediately following each pulse and rapidly decreases (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). To further illustrate this, we recorded responses to a single conspecific EOD of normal and reversed polarities from all 36 receptors in a single rosette of one <i>P. tenuicauda</i> (same receptors illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Responses from four of these receptors are shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>. Notice that again, across-receptor synchrony is greatest for the first poststimulus oscillation, but then rapidly declines. Summing responses across all 36 receptors resulted in a single, distinct peak immediately following the stimulus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), due to a transient synchronization across receptors followed by increasing asynchrony of receptors oscillating at different frequencies. In this way, the electrosensory system could use synchrony across the population of receptors to distinguish between stimulus-evoked and spontaneous oscillation cycles."

The degree of synchrony provides information about pulse timing and polarity, but it does not reflect the precise timing cues within the pulse waveform, consistent with the inability of these fish to behaviorally detect EOD waveform variation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Carlson et al., 2011</a>). Further, oscillating receptors are most sensitive to submillisecond IPIs that match their oscillation period (0.47\u20130.99 ms). This sensitivity is remarkable for two reasons. First, these submillisecond IPIs are too short for spiking receptors to reliably encode. Second, these IPIs are much shorter than those produced by individual fish, suggesting increased sensitivity to communication signals produced by groups of individuals. Indeed, playback experiments demonstrated that a species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to submillisecond IPIs within the range of enhanced receptor sensitivity. Thus, this novel peripheral coding mechanism may represent an adaptation for detecting communication signals from large groups of fish."

However, whether these phase resets encode specific information about a sensory stimulus or instead serve a modulatory function remains to be determined (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lakatos et al., 2009</a>). Futhermore, all phase resets previously described occur in central circuits and involve oscillations of much lower frequencies (&lt;100 Hz) than those (1\u20133 kHz) in the sensory receptors we describe (<a href=\"#bib29\">Harder, 1968b</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Thut et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Canavier, 2015</a>). Using in vivo extracellular recordings from single receptors, we demonstrate that phase resets in the periphery lead to transient synchrony among receptors, enabling detection of and entrainment to very fast temporal patterns in communication signals. Sensitivity to temporal patterns has been shown to involve network interactions in a wide range of central circuits (<a href=\"#bib37\">Klug et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Buonomano, 2014</a>).

Furthermore, these oscillation frequencies confer enhanced sensitivity to IPIs that can only be produced by groups of fish. Therefore, whereas spiking receptors are specialized for detecting signals from individuals, oscillating receptors appear specialized for detecting signals from a large group. Importantly, the submillisecond IPIs to which oscillating receptors are most sensitive do not necessarily reflect concerted signaling amongst the group.

Thus, the increased sensitivity of peripheral receptors for communication signals produced by groups of conspecifics may mediate the detection and localization of shoals or schools in fish's native habitats.

Furthermore, whether the oscillations that can be recorded extracellularly from rosette receptors represent collective spiking activity or non-spiking oscillatory potentials in sensory cells at the base of the receptor pore is also unknown. Importantly, the oscillations in mormyrid rosette receptors are distinct from oscillations in hair cells and other electroreceptors due to their larger amplitudes and higher frequencies, as well as the fact that they respond to stimuli with phase resets.

Spike-timing differences between receptors on opposite sides of the body are compared in the midbrain anterior exterolateral nucleus (ELa), where excitation and inhibition from different receptive fields establish single-neuron selectivity for stimulus pulse durations (<a href=\"#bib25\">Friedman and Hopkins, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lyons-Warren et al., 2013</a>).

This means that oscillations in all receptors will reset to the same phase in synchrony. In this case, subtracting the oscillatory responses of receptors on opposite sides of the body would result in cancellation. In contrast, in the presence of an external electric stimulus, receptors at different locations on the fish's body will experience opposite-polarity stimuli and will reset to opposite phases.

Stimuli coming from one direction would elicit maximal excitation from one side of the body and minimal inhibition from the other side, whereas stimuli from the opposite direction would elicit minimal excitation and maximal inhibition.

We fed the fish live black worms four times per week. Species of the genus <i>Petrocephalus</i> are extremely difficult to obtain. Therefore, to minimize the number of fish used in our physiological recordings, we collected just enough data to detect a robust pattern, which in some cases happened at a low sample size (e.g., n = 3 in <a href=\"#fig5 fig7\">Figures 5, 7</a>). All procedures were in accordance with the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Washington University in St. Louis."

Briefly, we anesthetized fish in 300 mg/l tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222, Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and then paralyzed and electrically silenced fish with 20\u201380 \u03bcl of 0.1 mg/ml gallamine triethiodide (Flaxedil, Sigma\u2013Aldrich). We then placed the fish in a 20 \u00d7 12.5 \u00d7 45 cm chamber filled with freshwater and positioned the fish on a plastic platform with lateral supports. We respirated the fish with freshwater through a pipette tip in the fish's mouth while monitoring the fish's electromotor output using a pair of electrodes placed next to the fish's tail (<a href=\"#bib18\">Carlson, 2002</a>). Flaxedil silences the EOD, but external electrodes can record fictive EOD motor commands from spinal electromotor neurons. After the fish had completely recovered from anesthesia, as indicated by the return of fictive EODs, we began the recording session. After receptor recordings, fish were allowed to recover completely from paralysis before being returned to their home tank."

Imperfections in artifact balancing had no impact on the detection and measurement of spiking responses.

To assess whether the stimulus artifact affected the first poststimulus oscillation peak, we compared the first poststimulus period to the average of the following five poststimulus periods.

If no spikes occurred in response to the second pulse, no interspike intervals were recorded. For clarity, stimulus artifacts were removed from the recording traces shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a> by drawing a straight line from the times of stimulus onset or offset plus 0.03 ms. In oscillating receptors, the stimulus artfact at the shortest IPIs tested obscured responses to the first pulse in the pair. To circumvent this issue, we first averaged oscillatory responses across stimulus presentations. Next, we measured the time interval between the first oscillatory peak that followed a single pulse and the first oscillatory peak that followed the second pulse in the pair. This method is equivalent to measuring the time interval between the first peaks following each pulse in the pair. We also measured the vector strength and poststimulus oscillation amplitude following the second pulse in the pair. We normalized mean poststimulus oscillation amplitudes by dividing by the mean poststimulus oscillation amplitude following a single pulse of 0.2 ms with the same polarity."

For single-fish recordings, fish were removed from their home tank and placed into a 15 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 31 cm plastic chamber with a single recording electrode in which the positive and negative terminals were separated by 20 cm. Fish were allowed to acclimate for at least 10 min before the recordings. For group recordings, we placed four vertically oriented electrodes suspended with the reference terminal up (16.5 cm from the top of the tank) in the home tank (61 \u00d7 76 \u00d7 61 cm) of each species. Each electrode was located one-third of the distance between tank walls (i.e., at the vertices of nine equally sized rectangles). We placed the electrodes in the tank and allowed fish to acclimate to them overnight before starting the recordings. We amplified electrical activity 100 times before band-pass filtering (0.1 Hz\u201320 kHz) (Model 1700, A-M Systems) and digitizing at 97.7 kHz (RX8, Tucker\u2013Davis Technologies). We detected EODs as points where the rectified recorded potential exceeded a threshold of 0.6 mV. Data were saved using custom Matlab software. For the histograms shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C,E,F</a>, we used the recording from just one of the four electrodes. Single-fish and group tank recordings took place between 1700 and 1900."

Briefly, we removed one fish from its group tank and placed it into a 10 gallon tank with a cylindrical plastic chamber (5 cm diameter \u00d7 13.2 cm) in the middle of the tank. If the fish was not inside the chamber at the end of a 30-min acclimation period, we guided the fish into the chamber with nets. Netted caps were then placed over each end of the chamber to keep the fish inside during the experiment. Fish were then allowed an additional 5-min acclimation period before starting the experiment. A pair of electrodes oriented horizontally along the inside walls of the chamber delivered the stimulus, and a pair of electrodes oriented vertically at either end of the chamber recorded the fish's EOD output. For each fish, we randomly selected a conspecific EOD waveform stimulus from a library. To generate the IPI train stimuli, we first defined the start and end of the EOD as the first and last points, respectively, where the absolute value of the waveform exceeded 0.5% of the maximum peak-to-peak amplitude. We then concatenated 10 identical EODs together, adding zero padding as necessary in between EODs to achieve the desired IPIs. If the duration of the EOD was longer than the IPI, we truncated the EOD at the IPI. We presented only normal-polarity (head-positive) stimuli. All stimuli were generated in Matlab, digital-to-analog converted at a rate of 195.31 kHz (RX8, Tucker\u2013Davis Technologies), and attenuated (PA5, Tucker\u2013Davis Technologies) before delivery to the analog stimulus isolator (Model 2200, A-M Systems)."

We collected a fish's responses to 20 repetitions of each IPI train and to a single EOD stimulus, with 1 min between trials to reduce habituation. We randomized stimulus order. To quantify responses, we recorded the time of each EOD produced by the fish, and then computed the spike-density function (SDF) by convolving each EOD time with a Gaussian of 200-ms width (<a href=\"#bib15\">Carlson and Hopkins, 2004</a>). We then averaged the SDF across stimulus repetitions. Next, we measured the fish's baseline response by averaging the resulting EOD rate over a window starting 0.2 s after the start of the 5-s prestimulus period and ending 0.2 s before stimulus onset. Because mormyrids can respond to electric stimuli with increases or decreases in their EOD rate (<a href=\"#bib46\">Moller et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Post and von der Emde, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Carlson et al., 2011</a>), we measured the maximum and minimum of the SDF that occurred between 0.2 s before stimulus onset and 1.2 s following stimulus offset. We subtracted the baseline discharge rate from these two values to get the maximum increase in EOD rate and the maximum decrease in EOD rate in response to the stimulus. Because response patterns varied across individuals (<a href=\"#bib46\">Moller et al., 1989</a>), we used a normalized measure of response strength. To compare responses across individuals, we subtracted the single-pulse response from the response to the IPI stimulus, and then we divided by the sum of the single-pulse and IPI response. We performed the same analysis on EOD rate increases and decreases."

The oscillating receptors encode electric pulses into phase resets that preserve the information necessary to detect and locate signals. Interestingly they are tuned to interpulse interval (IPI) rates that are well above the frequency range of pulses used by individual fish. These short IPIs are found only in recordings from groups of conspecifics and lead the authors to hypothesize that these receptor properties evolved as a means of detecting groups of conspecifics. The authors then test fish with oscillatory receptors and show that unlike those with spiking receptors they respond behaviorally (changes in electric organ discharge rate) to stimuli with the very short IPIs to which their receptors are optimally tuned."

One expert reviewer wrote \u201c<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> outlines the problem of coding pairs of input pulses. The spiking receptors respond to each input with a spike until the interval (IPI) is too small (they are refractory). In this case, it is clear (because of the nonlinearity of the spiking mechanism) that the timing of each stimulus pulse is represented in the receptor response (a spike). On the other hand, the oscillating receptors respond to the stimulus pulse with strong phase resets \u2013 by this I mean that the \u201cnew phase\u201d after the pulse is consistent across trials and does not depend on the timing of the stimulus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The authors argue that this reliable, stimulus-evoked phase reset can signal the timing of multiple pulses (IPI). This makes sense, as the cycle reset is somewhat analogous to a spike in the other receptors. However, it is not clear how downstream neurons would distinguish the reset cycles from the others. For example, when the IPI is longer than the cycle period (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, lower panel), what distinguishes the second cycle (i.e. second peak) following the first stimulus, from the cycle immediately following the second stimulus? Similarly, when the IPI is shorter than the cycle period (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> lower panel), the time between the cycles following each pulse is longer than the intrinsic cycle period. (Note that the receptor would not have access to the single pulse response for comparison, as in the analysis). In such cases, how will ambiguities between stimulus-perturbed cycles and free-running cycles be dealt with? Perhaps I have missed a key assumption but in the very least, a more detailed explanation of how this coding/decoding works would be appreciated.\u201d"

To me, this means that the phase reset varies with some feature of a sensory stimulus, and that phase (or change in phase) information is passed on to downstream networks as a representation of this stimulus feature. It follows that the phase reset (new phase) should depend on the particular value of the sensory feature. Taken in this context, the data presented suggest that only stimulus polarity can be coded by the phase reset; the phase reset is invariant with the other tested stimulus features, so cannot provide any information about these features. That said, the data show very nicely that transient synchrony among receptors (now shown to be sufficiently brief) provides a means to code for sub-millisecond inter-stimulus intervals, and very importantly, that this is reflected in behavioral responses. So my concern is not with the quality of the data or its significance (that is very clear). I just don't see it as \u201csensory coding by phase reset\u201d and presenting it as such leads to questions and confusion. Rather, information appears to be coded in the level of synchrony, which is changed by strong resets of the oscillating receptor to a single phase (an implicit requirement of a synchrony code). The work is then more appropriately set in the context of \u201csynchrony coding\u201d, and compared, for example, to the coding strategy described by Benda and colleagues in a related electrosensory system (as noted in the first review)."

We used a method of contrast to quantify fish\u2019s responses since individuals can vary in the magnitude of their responses across stimuli, and this served to normalize inter-individual variation. We have added clarification of these points in the Results (subsection \u201cBehavioral responses of a species with oscillating receptors reveal tuning to submillisecond IPIs\u201d) and Materials and methods (subsection \u201cBehavioral playback experiments\u201d)."

To me, this means that the phase reset varies with some feature of a sensory stimulus, and that phase (or change in phase) information is passed on to downstream networks as a representation of this stimulus feature. It follows that the phase reset (new phase) should depend on the particular value of the sensory feature. Taken in this context, the data presented suggest that only stimulus polarity can be coded by the phase reset; the phase reset is invariant with the other tested stimulus features, so cannot provide any information about these features. That said, the data show very nicely that transient synchrony among receptors (now shown to be sufficiently brief) provides a means to code for sub-millisecond inter-stimulus intervals, and very importantly, that this is reflected in behavioral responses. So my concern is not with the quality of the data or its significance (that is very clear). I just don't see it as \u201csensory coding by phase reset\u201d and presenting it as such leads to questions and confusion. Rather, information appears to be coded in the level of synchrony, which is changed by strong resets of the oscillating receptor to a single phase (an implicit requirement of a synchrony code). The work is then more appropriately set in the context of \u201csynchrony coding\u201d, and compared, for example, to the coding strategy described by Benda and colleagues in a related electrosensory system (as noted in the first review)</i>."

The Abstract, Introduction and Discussion have been edited accordingly. An additional paragraph in the Discussion has been moved and edited to the same end (seventh paragraph), a minor edit was made to eliminate the resulting repetition (sixth paragraph), and a minor edit has been made to the legend for <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> to clarify that spontaneous oscillations are not synchronized."
