                    "text": "Cortical responses to sensory stimuli are modulated by behavioral state. In the primary visual cortex (V1), visual responses of pyramidal neurons increase during locomotion. This response gain was suggested to be mediated through inhibitory neurons, resulting in the disinhibition of pyramidal neurons. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in layers 2/3 and 4 in mouse V1, we reveal that locomotion increases the activity of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons during visual stimulation, challenging the disinhibition model. In darkness, while most VIP and PV neurons remained locomotion responsive, SST and excitatory neurons were largely non-responsive. Context-dependent locomotion responses were found in each cell type, with the highest proportion among SST neurons. These findings establish that modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion is context-dependent and contest the generality of a disinhibitory circuit for gain control of sensory responses by behavioral state."

In the primary visual cortex (V1), visual responses of pyramidal neurons increase during locomotion. This response gain was suggested to be mediated through inhibitory neurons, resulting in the disinhibition of pyramidal neurons. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in layers 2/3 and 4 in mouse V1, we reveal that locomotion increases the activity of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons during visual stimulation, challenging the disinhibition model. In darkness, while most VIP and PV neurons remained locomotion responsive, SST and excitatory neurons were largely non-responsive. Context-dependent locomotion responses were found in each cell type, with the highest proportion among SST neurons. These findings establish that modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion is context-dependent and contest the generality of a disinhibitory circuit for gain control of sensory responses by behavioral state."

For example, we perceive a park landscape differently when we are running through it than when we are sitting on a park bench. Behavior can also alter neuronal responses in the brain. Indeed, the neurons in the part of the brain that receives information related to vision (known as the visual cortex) respond differently to visual stimuli when an animal is moving compared to when the animal is still. However, while some recent studies revealed that specific types of neurons become more or less responsive during movement, others reported the opposite results."

The experiments were conducted in two different contexts: in total darkness (in which the mice could not see) and in the presence of display screens (which provided the mice with visual stimulation)."

However, when the mouse ran in the dark, two of these neuron types became more active during running while the third type of neuron was unresponsive. This finding reveals more about the dynamic nature of inhibitory activity that strongly depends on the animal\u2019s behaviour.

Our results show that during visual stimulation these three classes of interneurons increase their activity with locomotion, challenging the model of a disinhibitory circuit mediated through SST neurons. We found that locomotion affects the activity of inhibitory circuits differently in darkness and during visual stimulation, revealing a context-dependent, cell type specific response to locomotion in V1. The highest proportion of context-dependent responses to locomotion was found among SST neurons, which play a central role in V1 microcircuits.

Neurons near the identity line show context-independent locomotion responses (similar LMI in darkness and during visual stimulation), while the other neurons changed their response to locomotion from one context to another (context-dependent responses). We first quantified this diversity by calculating the difference between the LMI value during visual stimulation and the LMI value in darkness for each neuron (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These results confirmed that VIP neurons displayed mainly context-independent locomotion responses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B(ii</a>), narrow distribution, centered around 0), while locomotion responses of SST neurons were mainly context dependent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B(iii)</a>, broad distribution shifted towards positive values). Both excitatory and PV neuronal populations included a diversity of locomotion responses (broad distributions). To quantify the proportions of context-independent and context-dependent neurons in each cell type, we first determined the variability of the locomotion responses for each context by comparing neuronal responses across odd and even locomotion periods (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; see Materials and methods). We found high correlation values for all neuronal populations, both in darkness and during visual stimulation (0.676\u00a0&lt; R &lt; 0.944; p&lt;0.0001), indicating a general low variability of the responses across different locomotion periods in both contexts. We determined the proportion of context-dependent neurons meeting two criteria: i) with a response that was significantly different across contexts (neurons distance from the identity line in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, to estimate the error on the LMI in both dark and stimulated conditions for each neuron, bootstrapping was employed (see Materials and methods)), and ii) with low variability of locomotion responses (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

In addition, these neurons receive subcortical inputs from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus as well as neuromodulatory inputs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Polack et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). Context-dependent locomotion responses of layer 2/3 neurons may thus come from one of these distinct inputs or from a combination of them. By using the same approach as for layer 2/3 neurons, we recorded locomotion responses in layer 4 neurons (excitatory n\u00a0=\u00a0331; VIP n\u00a0=\u00a057; SST n\u00a0=\u00a074; PV n\u00a0=\u00a0109; in 6, 4, 6 and 6 mice, respectively). As in layer 2/3, we used local injections of AAVs into V1 for the Cre-inducible expression of the genetically-encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f. However, we observed that on average the GCaMP6f labelling in layer 4 was sparser than in layer 2/3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Thus, we cannot exclude that we preferentially labelled subtypes of layer 4 neurons in which transduction efficiency with these AAV vectors would be higher. The quantification of locomotion responses showed no significant difference between layer 2/3 and layer 4 neurons, in any cell type, both in darkness and during visual stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). The results showed a higher mean LMI value for PV neurons in layer 4 (0.45 \u00b1 0.04) compared to layer 2/3 (0.35 \u00b1 0.04) during visual stimulation. However, this did not reach significance; p=0.058, Mann-Whitney U-test). In addition, the results showed similar proportions of context-dependent responses in layer 4 as described in layer 2/3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; context-dependent neurons: Exc, L2/3: 22%, L4: 17%; VIP, L2/3: 17%, L4: 26%; SST, L2/3: 49%, L4: 42%; PV, L2/3: 25%, L4: 23%)."

In this study, we found that the modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion is context-dependent and cell type specific, in layer 2/3 and layer 4 of mouse V1. During periods of visual stimulation, locomotion increases the activity of excitatory neurons as well as of three classes of inhibitory neurons (VIP, SST, PV; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). These results indicate that the enhancement of excitatory neuron visual responses during locomotion does not result from the inhibition of SST neurons, in mouse V1.

For a given fluorescent calcium indicator, the relationship between the amplitude of somatic fluorescence changes and the number of spikes can be affected by a number of factors including the concentration of calcium buffers in the soma, the balance between calcium influx and efflux as well as calcium release from internal stores (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grienberger et al., 2012</a>). Consequently, potential confounding factors in the present study would be (1) different intracellular calcium dynamics in different types of inhibitory neurons as well as (2) a higher increase of cytosolic free calcium concentration for the same number of spikes during locomotion compared to stationary periods. Considering that neuromodulators can regulate calcium influx (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fucile, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shen and Yakel, 2009</a>), this second possibility may result from the action of neuromodulators released during locomotion that would increase the amount of calcium entering the neuron in response to each spike.

For the same neuronal populations (layer 2/3 Excitatory, SST and PV neurons; layer 4 Excitatory neurons) and visual stimulation condition (drifting gratings), both data sets show the same relative change in signal during locomotion compared to stationary periods (corresponding to an approximate doubling of activity during locomotion for all three cell types).

This is in line with previous electrophysiological recordings of SST neurons (<a href=\"#bib35\">Polack et al., 2013</a>) but in contradiction with the current disinhibitory model that relies on the inhibition of SST neurons during locomotion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). Our results provide an explanation for these discrepancies since the aforementioned electrophysiological recordings were acquired during visual stimulation whereas imaging of SST activity was done in the dark (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). The disinhibitory model was based on the assumption that the locomotion-driven response of SST neurons would be similar in the dark and during visual stimulation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). The same assumption was made in the interpretation of membrane potential fluctuations of VIP and SST neurons recorded during the presentation of a blank screen (<a href=\"#bib36\">Reimer et al., 2014</a>). While VIP neurons were reliably depolarized during running, the SST population was heterogeneous. The authors distinguished two populations of SST interneurons (see Supplementary Figure 5C of <a href=\"#bib36\">Reimer et al., 2014</a>): Type I cells were inhibited by running while Type II cells were depolarized. Importantly, spiking activity of SST neurons was not reported and it is thus not clear how the membrane potential fluctuations relate to spiking activity."

We cannot exclude the possibility that a disinhibitory circuit may underlie the activity of a small fraction of neurons in darkness: the majority of VIP neurons increase their activity with locomotion, while a small proportion of SST neurons are inhibited during locomotion, potentially leading to the increase in activity of some pyramidal neurons. However, the results obtained in darkness show that the majority of SST neurons are not responsive to locomotion at all, challenging the generality of a disinhibitory circuit acting through the inhibition of SST neurons. With visual stimulation, the inconsistency of the disinhibitory model is even stronger since the vast majority of SST neurons increase their activity with locomotion (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B(iii)</a>). Consequently, the results obtained during visual stimulation (present study and <a href=\"#bib35\">Polack et al., 2013</a>) are incompatible with a model in which VIP neurons disinhibit excitatory neurons by inhibiting SST neurons. Additionally, while the vast majority of VIP neurons are context-independent with regard to their locomotion response, excitatory neurons show significantly increased locomotion responses during visual stimulation compared to darkness conditions. Therefore, the context-dependent responses of excitatory neurons do not result from a disinhibitory circuit initiated by VIP neurons."

Therefore, functional properties of inhibitory neurons should not be generalized from one context to the next, and caution should be taken when inferring connectivity from functional recordings obtained in a specific behavioral context."

                                "text": "Our results indicate that, in addition to the activation of VIP neurons during locomotion, other pathways are involved in linking locomotion and visual responses in V1. We suggest that neuromodulatory inputs triggered by locomotion would not only activate VIP neurons through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as previously shown (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alitto and Dan, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arroyo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fu et al., 2014</a>), but would also directly activate PV, SST, and excitatory neurons. Previous work has demonstrated cholinergic facilitation of cortical inhibitory neurons (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kawaguchi, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Xiang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arroyo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alitto and Dan, 2012</a>), including SST neurons (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kawaguchi, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fanselow et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Xu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). Similarly, in vitro studies have shown that norepinephrine can depolarize both excitatory (<a href=\"#bib27\">McCormick et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kirkwood et al., 1999</a>) and inhibitory\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">Kawaguchi and Shindou, 1998</a>) cortical neurons. Finally, in vivo studies have shown that neuromodulatory inputs, cholinergic and noradrenergic, can control the gain and signal-to-noise ratio of V1 excitatory neurons during locomotion (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pinto et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Polack et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bennett et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). We suggest that in darkness, the effect of neuromodulatory inputs remains subthreshold in SST neurons. During visual stimulation, SST neurons are strongly activated and the effect of neuromodulatory inputs becomes suprathreshold. In agreement with the known intra-cortical connectivity in mouse V1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pfeffer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jiang et al., 2015</a>), our findings support this neuromodulatory hypothesis. In darkness, VIP and PV neurons are activated by locomotion and inhibit SST and excitatory neurons, preventing their activation by locomotion-dependent inputs. During visual stimulation, SST and excitatory neurons are activated: they overcome the intra-cortical inhibition by VIP and PV neurons and become responsive to direct locomotion-dependent inputs. Since SST neurons provide the main intra-cortical input to VIP neurons (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pfeffer et al., 2013</a>) and are strongly visually-responsive, they likely inhibit VIP neurons (or a subpopulation of VIP neurons) during visual stimulation. This is consistent with the decrease in activity of a portion of VIP neurons that was observed during visual stimulation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fu et al., 2014</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B(ii</a>)."

Indeed, recent studies have shown that projections from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (<a href=\"#bib10\">Erisken et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Roth et al., 2016</a>) and from the thalamic latero-posterior nucleus (<a href=\"#bib37\">Roth et al., 2016</a>) to V1 both convey locomotion signals."

Regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to neuronal cell bodies were selected manually by inspecting down-sampled frames (2\u2009Hz), as well as the maximum intensity projection of each imaging stack (60\u2009s trial). The\u00a0pixel intensity within each ROI was averaged to create a raw fluorescence time series F(t). Baseline fluorescence F<sub>0</sub> was computed for each neuron by taking the fifth percentile of the smoothed F(t) (1\u00a0Hz lowpass, zero-phase, 60th-order FIR filter) over each trial (F<sub>0</sub>(t)), averaged across all trials. As a consequence, the same baseline F<sub>0</sub> was used for computing the changes in fluorescence in darkness and during visual stimulation. The change in fluorescence relative to baseline, \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> was computed by taking the difference between F and F<sub>0</sub>(t) and dividing by F<sub>0</sub>. In order to remove neuropil contamination, we used nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), which is a low rank matrix decomposition method used for demixing spatially overlapping signal sources (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kim and Park, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Langville et al., 2014</a>), as implemented in NIMFA 1.2.1 (<a href=\"#bib43\">\u017ditnik and Zupan, 2012</a>).

To define stationary and locomotion periods we used the following criteria. Stationary corresponded to periods where the\u00a0instantaneous speed (as measured at the 40\u2009Hz sampling rate) was less than 0.1 cm/s. Locomotion corresponded to periods meeting three criteria: instantaneous speed \u2265 0.1 cm/s, 0.25\u00a0Hz lowpass filtered speed \u2265 0.1\u00a0cm/s, and an average speed \u2265\u00a00.1\u00a0cm/s over a 2 s window centered at this point in time. Any inter-locomotion interval shorter than 500 ms was also labelled as locomotion. Stationary periods less than 3\u2009s after or 0.2\u2009s before a period of locomotion were removed from the analysis. The locomotion modulation index (LMI) was defined as the difference between the mean \u2206F/F<sub>0</sub> during locomotion (R<sub>L</sub>) and stationary (R<sub>s</sub>) periods, normalized by the sum of both values: LMI = (R<sub>L</sub> \u2013 R<sub>s</sub>)/(R<sub>L</sub> + R<sub>s</sub>)."

We binned the signal into 1\u2009s bins, each of which had only one visual stimulus and one behavioral activity (locomotion or stationary) throughout its duration. For each 1\u2009s bin, we took the mean \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> and regarded this value as a single sample. For periods of time which had a single stimulus and behavioral activity persisted for longer than 1\u2009s, additional samples were drawn with intervals of no less than 2\u2009s. This interval duration was selected based on the autocorrelation of the calcium fluorescence signal, which took approximately 2\u2009s to fall to 0.5. The average correlation between consecutive samples of the same stimulus and activity condition was computed as a weighted average over all conditions, and was found to be R = 0.35. We then randomly selected samples of \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> with replacement from our original set of samples. The number of samples selected in each bootstrap resample (65% = 1-R) was reduced from the total number of samples available to reflect the fact that our samples were not completely independent. This process was repeated 10000 times to obtain 95% confidence intervals for significance tests for each neuron individually. A neuron was considered significantly locomotion responsive if its 95% confidence interval was significantly different from an LMI of 0 and its value exceeded an LMI of 0.2 (at least 50% change in \u2206F/F<sub>0</sub> between locomotion and stationary)."

To monitor activity the authors use calcium indicators conditionally expressed in distinct neuron types in layer 2/3 and 4. During visual stimulation all cell types (VIP, SST, PV and Excitatory neurons) showed increased activity during locomotion. In darkness the response to locomotion was essentially restricted to VIP and PV cells. These interesting results challenge the generality of some recent publication and are discussed in the context of state dependent neuromodulation. The mechanisms by which visual processing is affected by locomotion has captured the curiosity of many labs. Clearly, determining how distinct types of cortical inhibitory neurons are modulated by locomotion is an important step towards this goal. The observations challenge the notion that all running-based modulations can be accounted for by a disinhibitory circuit involving VIP \u2013 SOM \u2013 pyramidal cells."

To my knowledge, they only show that activity of SOM interneurons is very low during anaesthesia, and much higher during running (2) Reimer et al., 2014 observed more hyperpolarized Vm of SOM interneurons during running with a blank screen (which is possibly a gray screen condition), but again this is not treated in the manuscript. (3) Contrary to the citation in l. 226, to my knowledge neither Ayaz et al. 2013 nor Saleem et al. 2013 performed targeted electrophysiological recordings of SOM interneurons.

Transgene expression is typically weaker and sparser in layer 4 than in layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal cells. Given the sparse expression in layer 4, it is more than likely that the expression system preferentially targets a specific subtype of layer 4 pyramidal cell. Thus it is hard to extrapolate to layer 4 in general. Note, this is not something the authors should address experimentally, but it is a caveat that should probably be discussed. b) Layer 4 could of course receives input from all other layers, thus it becomes a chicken and egg problem as to where the locomotion modulation in layer 4 comes from. The authors' data may therefore not support the conclusion of a \"prominent role of subcortical inputs in both layers for the modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion\" (Results section, subsection \u201cLayer 4 excitatory and inhibitory responses to locomotion are similar to layer 2/3\u201d).

During the consultation session, the reviewers thought that the Discussion needs a little more detail about how the disinhibitory circuit model fails. Specifically, compared to the previous version, there is the impression that the data became even more complicated. Specifically, based on the LMI, you concluded that the VIP modulation by locomotion is context-independent (i.e. probably consistent with the disinhibitory scheme), while the SST modulation during visual stimulation is probably breaking the scheme. The addition of the cross-correlation analysis, however, suggests that part of the observations look more in line with the disinhibitory model: in darkness, where VIP have higher cross-correlation peaks, SST have lower ones; during visual stimulation, where VIP have lower cross-correlation peaks, SST have higher ones. A similar trend is visible for the LMI but not significant."

For the same neuronal populations (layer 2/3 Excitatory, SST and PV neurons and layer 4 Excitatory neurons) and visual stimulation condition (drifting gratings), both data sets show the same relative increase of activity during locomotion compared to stationary periods (corresponding to an approximate doubling of activity during locomotion for all three cell types).

Importantly, spiking activity of SOM neurons is not described in this article that only presents changes in membrane potential (Vm). It is thus not clear how the (mild) hyperpolarization of Type 1 neurons during locomotion relates to the spiking activity. These results were obtained during the presentation of a blank screen.

Transgene expression is typically weaker and sparser in layer 4 than in layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal cells. Given the sparse expression in layer 4, it is more than likely that the expression system preferentially targets a specific subtype of layer 4 pyramidal cell. Thus it is hard to extrapolate to layer 4 in general. Note, this is not something the authors should address experimentally, but it is a caveat that should probably be discussed. b) Layer 4 could of course receives input from all other layers, thus it becomes a chicken and egg problem as to where the locomotion modulation in layer 4 comes from. The authors' data may therefore not support the conclusion of a \"prominent role of subcortical inputs in both layers for the modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion\" (Results section, subsection \u201cLayer 4 excitatory and inhibitory responses to locomotion are similar to layer 2/3\u201d).

The LMI and cross-correlation analyses both show similar results regarding the relative changes of VIP and SST responses to locomotion in darkness and visual stimulation. The only difference in the previous submission was in the level of statistical significance. The cross-correlation analysis was initially included following the suggestion of the reviewers to provide a direct comparison between our data and those published previously (Fu et al. 2014). With this aim, we used the same statistical approach (pooling all neurons together) as in the Fu et al., 2014 article and the difference between dark and visual stimulation became significant for VIP neurons (whereas it is not the case in the LMI analysis in which statistics are performed across animals). We agree that this was confusing and we have now applied the same statistical approach for our cross-correlation data as for the rest of the article. As we discussed in our answer to point 20 in our first revision, we think that using the number of animals as our sample size is more suitable. Comparing measures across neurons, rather than across animals, would incorrectly inflate the degrees of freedom with the risk of false positive results for detecting significant differences. The justification of this statistical approach is clearly described in the Materials and methods section (Materials and methods section, subsection 'Statistics')."
