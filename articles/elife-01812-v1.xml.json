They are built around a central cartwheel assembly that is organized through homo-oligomerization of the centriolar protein SAS-6, but whether SAS-6 self-assembly can dictate cartwheel and thereby centriole symmetry is unclear. Here we show that <i>Leishmania major</i> SAS-6 crystallizes as a 9-fold symmetric cartwheel and provide the X-ray structure of this assembly at a resolution of 3.5 \u00c5. We furthermore demonstrate that oligomerization of <i>Leishmania</i> SAS-6 can be inhibited by a small molecule in vitro and provide indications for its binding site. Our results firmly establish that SAS-6 can impose cartwheel symmetry on its own and indicate how this process might occur mechanistically in vivo. Importantly, our data also provide a proof-of-principle that inhibition of SAS-6 oligomerization by small molecules is feasible."

They are built around a central cartwheel assembly that is organized through homo-oligomerization of the centriolar protein SAS-6, but whether SAS-6 self-assembly can dictate cartwheel and thereby centriole symmetry is unclear. Here we show that <i>Leishmania major</i> SAS-6 crystallizes as a 9-fold symmetric cartwheel and provide the X-ray structure of this assembly at a resolution of 3.5 \u00c5. We furthermore demonstrate that oligomerization of <i>Leishmania</i> SAS-6 can be inhibited by a small molecule in vitro and provide indications for its binding site. Our results firmly establish that SAS-6 can impose cartwheel symmetry on its own and indicate how this process might occur mechanistically in vivo. Importantly, our data also provide a proof-of-principle that inhibition of SAS-6 oligomerization by small molecules is feasible."

Some cilia also beat to move fluids across the cell surface\u2014for example, to move mucus out of the lungs\u2014or act as flagella that undergo rapid whip-like movements to propel cells along. Cilia are formed when a small cylindrical structure in the cell called a centriole docks against the cell membrane and subsequently grows out. However, many of the details of this process are poorly understood."

This cartwheel acts as a scaffold onto which the rest of the centriole is then added. It has been proposed that a protein called SAS-6 can build this cartwheel just by interacting with itself. However, this has so far not been shown clearly. Now, using a technique called X-ray crystallography, van Breugel et al. directly confirm this hypothesis. This is significant because it demonstrates that the simple self interaction of a protein could lie at the heart of building a complex structure like a centriole."

If SAS-6 cannot assemble into the cartwheel structure, flagella cannot form correctly, potentially stopping the parasites. By screening a library of small molecules, van Breugel et al. found one that partially disrupted the interactions of SAS-6 with itself in the test tube. This small molecule interacted only very weakly with SAS-6 and was not specific for SAS-6 from the disease-causing organism. These unfavourable properties therefore make this compound of no immediate use. However, this result nevertheless shows that small molecules can impair SAS-6 function at least in the test tube and that the development of a more efficient inhibitor might therefore be possible."

Their formation strictly requires the presence of centrioles, cylindrical organelles with a radially ninefold symmetric, peripheral microtubule array (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bettencourt-Dias and Glover, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Azimzadeh and Marshall, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gonczy, 2012</a>). During ciliogenesis/flagellogenesis, centrioles (then referred to as basal bodies) dock to the cell membrane via their distal ends and nucleate the flagellar/ciliar axoneme from their microtubule array (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sherwin and Gull, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dawe et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Avasthi and Marshall, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chemes, 2012</a>). The symmetry and diameter of centrioles (and thereby of flagella/cilia) is, to a large extent, established through scaffolding by the centriolar cartwheel, a structure with a central ring-like hub and nine radially projecting spokes that contact the peripheral centriolar microtubules (<a href=\"#bib4\">Azimzadeh and Marshall, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brito et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gonczy, 2012</a>)."

High-resolution crystal structures of zebrafish and <i>C. reinhardtii</i> SAS-6 fragments together with biochemical and biophysical characterizations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>) demonstrated that two dimerization interfaces in SAS-6 mediate this oligomerization: a coiled-coil domain that forms a rod-like parallel dimer; and a globular N-terminal domain that forms a curved head-to-head dimer. Modeling these two dimer interactions together in silico resulted in ring assemblies that were compatible with the symmetry and dimension of cartwheels observed in vivo. In these models, the N-terminal head domains constitute the cartwheel hubs from which the coiled-coil rods project to form the cartwheel spokes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>). However, so far, no high-resolution structure of the SAS-6 cartwheel is available. Although rotary shadowing EM studies suggested that SAS-6 might be able to form cartwheels, the available resolution was insufficient to determine the symmetry of the observed assemblies directly (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>). Another, higher resolution, EM study with recombinant SAS-6 revealed cartwheel-like assemblies with an eightfold, not a ninefold symmetry (<a href=\"#bib54\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>), while a third EM study showed the presence of SAS-6 tetramers (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, the available biochemical and biophysical data do not provide evidence for efficient cartwheel formation by SAS-6 in solution (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>), raising the question of whether SAS-6 alone is sufficient to organize ninefold symmetric cartwheels and, if so, under what conditions."

Inhibiting SAS-6 self-assembly by point mutations in vivo abolishes the formation of centrioles (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lettman et al., 2013</a>) and thereby flagella (<a href=\"#bib54\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>). Thus, targeting SAS-6 oligomerization by inhibitors could be a strategy to disable flagellogenesis in organisms that cause human disease and rely on flagella for their pathogenicity. The Trypanosomatids are of special interest in this respect. They consist of parasitic, eukaryotic protozoa with a single flagellum and comprise members that cause major human diseases, such as sleeping sickness (<i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>), Chagas disease (<i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>), and Leishmaniasis (<i>Leishmania spec.</i>) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Simpson et al., 2006</a>). These organisms display complex life cycles in which they shuttle between an insect vector and human or animal hosts. Their flagellum provides key roles in this life cycle through its multiple functions in essential cellular processes such as motility, signalling, sensing, and attachment (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vaughan and Gull, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ralston et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gluenz et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, the flagellar pocket, a membrane invagination from which the flagellum emerges, is the exclusive site of vesicular membrane traffic in these organisms (<a href=\"#bib44\">Overath et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Landfear and Ignatushchenko, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Field and Carrington, 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Overath and Engstler, 2004</a>). It is therefore not surprising that flagella have been demonstrated or are proposed to be key factors in the pathogenicity of these organisms (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vaughan and Gull, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ralston et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gluenz et al., 2010</a>)."

The asymmetric unit (ASU) of the crystal contained three molecules that were virtually identical to each other (139 \u00b1 2 selected pairs superpose with an rmsd of 0.70 \u00b1 0.13 \u00c5 in secondary structure matching). Our structure demonstrates a high similarity of <i>L. major</i> SAS-6 to previously solved SAS-6 structures (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>) (secondary structure matching to the <i>D. rerio</i> SAS-6 head domain results in an rmsd of 1.59 \u00b1 0.09 \u00c5 with 133 \u00b1 2 selected pairs). Like these, the N-terminal domain of <i>L. major</i> SAS-6 consists of a 7-stranded \u03b2-barrel, capped by a helix-turn-helix motif, that forms a curved cross-handshake homo-dimer within the crystal through a highly conserved interaction interface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). In this dimer, the \u03b2-hairpins formed by \u03b2-strands \u03b26 and \u03b27 pack antiparallelly against each other. Phenylalanine 257 at the tip of this hairpin is inserted into a conserved hydrophobic pocket that is constituted by the helix-turn-helix motif and the base of this hairpin in the B-C homo-dimer (formed by chain B and chain C in the crystal, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Dimerization is also observed in solution, as judged by equilibrium ultracentrifugation, and then depends on the presence of F257 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The measured K<sub>D</sub> of this dimerization is \u223c600 \u03bcM and therefore approximately 5- to 10-fold weaker than seen for other SAS-6 homologues (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>)."

In the Lm SAS-6<sup>97\u2013274</sup> crystal, the A\u2013A homo-dimer (formed by chain A and symmetry-related chain A) shares the features of the B\u2013C homo-dimer described above. However, in the A\u2013A homo-dimer, the Y215 sidechain is flipped into its own hydrophobic pocket resulting in the displacement from this pocket of residue F257 of its homo-dimer partner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) probably weakening the interaction. Intriguingly, we found a similar arrangement in the Lm SAS-6<sup>97\u2013320</sup> F257E crystal. The F257E mutation abolishes head-to-head dimerization in solution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), yet, in the crystal, due to the high protein and precipitant concentrations, some of the SAS-6 molecules present are found nevertheless in head-to-head dimers and form a curved octamer. In this octamer residues Y215 are also swung into their own hydrophobic pockets, while E257 point away from them (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data suggest that the closed Y215 conformation corresponds to a low-affinity dimerization state of the head domains and might therefore constitute a potential regulatory mechanism of SAS-6 oligomerization. In solution, the presence of a dimerization-impaired state could also explain the relatively low affinity of head-to-head dimerization of wild-type <i>L. major</i> SAS-6 apparent in analytical ultracentrifugation (\u223c600 \u03bcM compared to 50\u2013100 \u03bcM observed for other species) since other SAS-6 homologues do not have aromatic residues at the equivalent position of Y215 that could play such a role."

Subsequently, we subjected the purified protein to analytical ultracentrifugation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The measured K<sub>D</sub> of head-to-head dimerization of the Y215K mutant was \u223c200 \u03bcM and therefore approximately threefold lower than for the corresponding wild-type protein. We conclude that Y215 acts to partially inhibit head-to-head dimerization of <i>L. major</i> SAS-6."

The low affinity of head-to-head dimerization together with the concomitant sample heterogeneity makes EM studies of the resulting assemblies technically challenging. To overcome these limitations we tried to crystallize <i>L. major</i> SAS-6 constructs with both dimerization interfaces intact. Obtaining crystals that diffracted well enough to solve their structure proved difficult. However, with the wild-type construct of Lm SAS-6<sup>97\u2013320</sup>, we finally succeeded to find a crystal form of the space-group H3 that diffracted to a resolution of \u223c3.5 \u00c5 along the l-axis with anisotropy limiting the resolution along the h-k plane to \u223c4.2 \u00c5. Using the structure of the Lm SAS-6<sup>97\u2013274</sup> B\u2013C homo-dimer as a search model, a molecular replacement solution could be found that allowed the subsequent placement of the coiled-coil part present in the construct (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The unit cell of the Lm SAS-6<sup>97\u2013320</sup> crystal form contained three 9-fold symmetric SAS-6 rings with three SAS-6 dimers constituting the ASU. These three dimers were highly similar to each other and overlayed with an rmsd of 0.88 \u00b1 0.29 \u00c5 in secondary structure matching with 357 \u00b1 14 selected pairs. No electron density was seen inside the SAS-6 rings. The inner diameters of the SAS-6 rings are \u223c19 nm and correspond well to the diameters of cartwheel hubs observed in vivo (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lacomble et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Guichard et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2012</a>). In the crystal, SAS-6 rings are stacked onto each other. Neighbouring rings interact through inter-digitation of their coiled-coil domains in an antiparallel way (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We confirmed our structural model by calculating a phased anomalous map using the refined phases based on our model and the amplitudes of an isomorphic dataset collected from crystals of the selenomethionine derivative (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Peaks in this map correlated with the positions of methionines in our model. Thus, under appropriate conditions, <i>L. major</i> SAS-6 can adopt ninefold symmetric rings that are highly similar to cartwheels observed in vivo."

First, pools of compounds were screened for their ability to bind to and thereby cause a shift perturbation in the {<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N}-HSQC NMR spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N labelled Lm SAS-6. To avoid ambiguities in the interpretation of shift perturbations that could stem from the partial presence of oligomers, we used the Lm SAS-6<sup>97\u2013274</sup> F257E mutant for these binding studies that is monomeric in solution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). One dimensional spin-echo experiments provided a crude estimate of 18 ms for the backbone amide <sup>1</sup>H <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> relaxation time constants, consistent with the molecular mass of the construct (\u223c20 kDa) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anglister et al., 1993</a>)."

Strong perturbations in chemical shifts are most consistent with compound PK9119 ((5-bromo-7-ethyl-1<i>H</i>-indol-3-ylmethyl)-dimethyl-amine, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) binding adjacent to the head-to-head dimerization interface of Lm SAS-6<sup>97\u2013274</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Smaller, but significant shift changes indicate that binding may alter this interface by affecting the conformation of the helix-turn-helix motif that constitutes a part of it. We also examined aromatic side chain <sup>1</sup>H resonances of the Phe and Tyr residues using C\u03b2\u2013H\u03b4 correlation maps, which enabled us to identify two side-chains (F199, F212) that are perturbed on binding of PK9119 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These two side-chains cluster together around the helix-turn-helix motif. HSQC chemical shift titration experiments with PK9119 and <i>L. major</i> SAS-6<sup>97\u2013274</sup> F257E suggest a millimolar binding affinity; the low solubility of PK9119 in aqueous solutions and lack of a reference compound for competition binding assays makes more accurate K<sub>D</sub> determinations technically challenging."

Since we were unable to make full length <i>L. major</i> SAS-6 recombinantly, we used a <i>L. major</i> SAS-6 construct that contained the N-terminal domain and approximately half of its coiled-coil domain (Lm SAS-6<sup>97\u2013424</sup>) for this assay. Similar to the previous findings (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>), we did not find evidence for a stable ring-fraction of SAS-6 in solution, but found a complex equilibrium of SAS-6 oligomers (ranging up to approximately SAS-6 hexamers) for the wild-type construct in the absence of PK9119, while the F257E mutant was a stable dimer under these conditions, in agreement with stable dimer formation through its coiled-coil domain. When the runs were repeated in the presence of PK9119, we saw a clear shift in the elution volume for the wild-type but not the F257E SAS-6 construct towards smaller molecular weights and a decrease in the analysed mass from MALS, demonstrating that PK9119 partially affects head-to-head dimerization. We also repeated this experiment with the equivalent constructs of zebrafish SAS-6 (Dr SAS-6<sup>1\u2013326</sup>, wild-type and F131D) under similar conditions. The results showed that zebrafish SAS-6 oligomerization was also affected by the presence of PK9119, although to a lesser extent than <i>L. major</i> SAS-6 oligomerization (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, PK9119 appears to be a general inhibitor of SAS-6 oligomerization in vitro with some preference for the <i>L. major</i> variant, and represents a starting point for further screening of chemical analogs or fragment evolution."

However, we demonstrate that under high protein and precipitant concentrations, a <i>L. major</i> SAS-6 construct crystallized as ninefold symmetric rings with a diameter very similar to cartwheel hubs in vivo; this provides the first unambiguous experimental evidence that SAS-6 is able to form ninefold symmetric cartwheels on its own. Our results suggest that SAS-6 needs to be highly concentrated locally in order to be able to form cartwheels. Intriguingly, in vivo, SAS-6 is indeed highly enriched at the site of centriole formation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Strnad et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dammermann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blachon et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sonnen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lettman et al., 2013</a>). However, in vivo, SAS-6 assembly occurs in the context of other essential centriole duplication factors, some of which can be found in a complex with SAS-6 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Stevens et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lin et al., 2013</a>). It is therefore likely that additional centriole proteins assist SAS-6 assembly, especially in light of the fact that several studies (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>), and our study presented here, have been unable to demonstrate efficient cartwheel assembly by SAS-6 in solution."

The interaction interfaces that are critical for ring formation (i.e., the head-to-head dimer interface and the head-domain\u2013coiled-coil interface) are both relatively small (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kitagawa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>). In solution, SAS-6 oligomers are therefore likely to show some \u2018wobble\u2019 that would make ring closure inefficient and assembled rings unstable. However, in our ring structure, both of these critical interfaces are similar in their orientations to those observed in the crystals of the Lm SAS-6<sup>97\u2013320</sup> F257E and the Lm SAS-6<sup>97\u2013274</sup> constructs that did not crystallize as rings (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, although clearly not occurring efficiently in solution, our data suggest that ninefold symmetric ring formation might correspond to a weakly favored SAS-6 conformation that needs to be stabilized. In our crystal structure, rings are stabilized by crystal packing interactions and, in vivo, probably by SAS-6 interacting proteins. This model could explain why SAS-6 is required for the faithful establishment of centriole symmetry, while not being the sole determinant of their ninefold symmetry in vivo (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nakazawa et al., 2007</a>)."

Furthermore, although a comparable packing was previously observed in a crystal of the N-terminal head domain of zebrafish SAS-6 (<a href=\"#bib54\">van Breugel et al., 2011</a>), the underlying packing interactions are based on a non-conserved interface and are therefore unlikely to be of relevance in vivo. Recent EM tomograms of basal bodies from Trichonympha (<a href=\"#bib26\">Guichard et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2013</a>) rather suggest that ring stacking in vivo is based on parallel interactions between the SAS-6 coiled-coil stalks and vertical interactions of SAS-6 associated components at the periphery of centriolar cartwheels."

In this state, residue Y215 blocks the hydrophobic pocket into which F257 from its homo-dimer partner binds. Mutating Y215 to lysine resulted in an apparent threefold increase in dimerization affinity as measured by analytical ultracentrifugation. If open and closed Y215 conformations are in equilibrium with each other, the dimerization affinity of the closed Y215 state in solution would be even lower than the measured value, since, in this case, ultracentrifugation analyses the association of a mixture of open and closed states. We speculate that a release of this closed SAS-6 state through either a regulatory protein or a direct phosphorylation of Y215 could provide a simple mechanism to trigger SAS-6 assembly locally by increasing the concentration of assembly efficient SAS-6. Should this mechanism indeed be used in vivo (which is currently unknown), it would probably be confined to the Trypanosomatids as other SAS-6 homologues appear not to have tyrosine/aromatic residues in the position equivalent to Y215 that could play an equivalent role."

The evolutionary conservation of the hydrophobic pocket involved in dimerization together with PK9119\u2019s relatively broad activity in inhibiting both <i>L. major</i> and (to a lesser extent) <i>D. rerio</i> SAS-6 could suggest that PK9119 targets this pocket. However, our NMR binding studies are most consistent with PK9119 binding adjacent to the head-to-head dimerization interface and thereby altering its structure subtly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Confirming this notion, when we modeled the SAS-6\u2013PK9119 complex with the HADDOCK software package (available at <a href=\"http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK/haddock.php)\">http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK/haddock.php)</a> (<a href=\"#bib15\">de Vries et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wassenaar et al., 2012</a>), using high ambiguity restraints derived from the observed chemical shift perturbations in HSQC spectra (6 restraints &gt;0.2 ppm), we found that of the 200 docked structures 98% occupied a single cluster in which PK9119 was bound to helix \u03b11, but not on the side lining the hydrophobic pocket, but on its opposite side, facing away from this pocket (data not shown). Clearly, an elucidation of a high-resolution structure of PK9119 bound to its target would be important to understand how exactly PK9119 functions in inhibiting <i>L. major</i> SAS-6. The binding affinity of our compound is currently low (in the mM range) and it does not show strong species specificity. To establish whether PK9119 has any potential to be improved in these critical aspects, it will be essential to systematically explore chemical modifications of its central indole scaffold. Regardless of these limitations, our demonstration that SAS-6 can be inhibited in vitro is a first, small step towards the goal of developing SAS-6 inhibitors that also could be used in vivo, for example as a cell-biological tool."

Sample volumes of 110 \u00b5l with protein concentrations of 100, 200, and 400 \u03bcM were loaded in 12 mm 6-sector cells and centrifuged at 11300, 17000, and 21200 rpm until equilibrium was reached at 4\u00b0C. At each speed, comparison of several scans was used to judge whether or not equilibrium had been reached. Buffer conditions were 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0.

Detector 12 in the Heleos instrument was replaced with Wyatt\u2019s QELS detector for dynamic light scattering measurement. Protein samples (100 \u03bcl) were resolved on a Superdex S-200 10/300 analytical gel filtration column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) running at 0.5 ml/min in 50 mM bisTris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.0 buffer, containing 0.126% (vol/vol) DMSO and \u00b11 mM chemical compound PK9119 ((5-bromo-7-ethyl-1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-dimethyl-amine, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) before passing through the light scattering and refractive index detectors in a standard SEC-MALS format. Buffers were filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter before usage to remove any PK9119 precipitates. Protein concentration was determined from the excess differential refractive index based on 0.186 RI increment for 1 g/ml protein solution. The concentration and the observed scattered intensity at each point in the chromatograms were used to calculate the absolute molecular mass from the intercept of the Debye plot using Zimm\u2019s model as implemented in Wyatt\u2019s ASTRA software (commercially available from Wyatt technology, Santa Barbara, California, details at: <a href=\"http://www.wyatt.com/products/software/astra.html\">http://www.wyatt.com/products/software/astra.html</a>)."

Most importantly, the authors were also able to solve the structure of the wild-type 97-320 construct, and made the important observation that this fragment crystallizes in a nine-fold symmetry, creating a ring with a diameter very similar to cartwheel hubs observed in centrioles in vivo. Thus, the authors' data show that SAS-6 is sufficient to form a ring with nine-fold symmetry and that other components are not required."

The additional structures add to the strength of the story. The identification of a potential small molecule inhibitor is nice and makes it a sound story for publication. The auto-inhibitory discussion may be a little overdone with little experimental support, but it seems reasonable to present the idea that Y215 may play a direct role in SAS-6 assembly regulation. Thus, the paper should be published in <i>eLife</i> once the authors have addressed the following minor comments, using their own judgement as to how best to respond to each of these points. The revised paper will receive a very rapid final decision by the editor without further review, and so a clear discussion of how these points are addressed will be helpful."

It is also clear that it isn't stable in any in vitro context outside the crystal. Since it is difficult to argue about free energy or energy from crystal structures, particularly due to the confounding effects of local concentration, the authors may wish to just exclude these arguments (the structure speaks for itself). Specifically, in the section entitled \u2018<i>Leishmania major</i> SAS-6 crystallizes as 9-fold symmetric rings that are highly similar to centriolar cartwheels in vivo\u2019: the authors argue that because each of the dimers in the asymmetric unit in the 97-320 structure has a similar conformation, this conformation represents a low energy state of SAS-6. The logic of this argument and the rationale for making it are unclear. Any conformation that crystallizes (including tetrameric and octameric SAS-6) is likely to be a low energy conformation. The observation that under the 97-320 crystallization conditions SAS-6 forms a nine-membered ring is not sufficient evidence to claim the head-to-head dimer conformation in the nine-fold symmetrical ring is more stable in general than the dimer interfaces previously observed in octameric or tetrameric structures."

We also further expanded our discussion of how ring stacking might be mediated in vivo in light of the recent EM tomographic reconstructions of basal bodies. Concerning the Hilbert et al., (PNAS 2013) publication reporting that <i>C. elegans</i> SAS-6 might form 9-fold symmetric spirals we preferred not to expand the Discussion (which is already long) further.

So far, SAS-6 spirals have not been demonstrated in <i>C. elegans</i> in vivo and we therefore believe that tying in their findings in our discussion would not be straightforward and would run the risk of distracting from the \u201ccanonical\u201d SAS-6 homologues with well-established cartwheel geometries."

We show now with a supplementary figure (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2</a>) that the head-to-head orientation and the relative orientation of head-domains to coiled coil stalks in the nine-membered ring are similar to those observed in the two other crystal structures presented in our manuscript that do not crystallize as rings (97-320 FE construct and WT 97-274 construct). Furthermore, in previous studies, in silico modeling of 9-fold symmetric rings required only small changes of the crystal structures of zebrafish and <i>Chlamydomonas</i> SAS-6 fragments (van Breugel M et al. Science. 2011; 331(6021):1196-9, Kitagawa et al. Cell. 2011; 144(3):364-375). To our mind these data suggest that despite some \u201cwobble\u201d, due to the small interaction interfaces involved, the observed orientations in our ring structure might very well be weakly favored. Efficient ring-formation is clearly not observed in solution, probably due to this flexibility and also due to the low affinities involved. Under our assay conditions (SEC-MALS) it would be difficult to observe a small fraction of nine-fold symmetric rings present in solution. We argue that SAS-6 rings need to be stabilized, either by crystal packing interactions (as in our structure in vitro) or by additional SAS-6 interacting proteins (in vivo). We believe that this model could explain why SAS-6 is essential for faithful establishment of the centriolar symmetry, while not being the sole determinant of it.
