Using deep-etch electron microscopy, we find that endogenous ESCRT-III filaments stabilized by depleting cells of Vps4 create uniform membrane-deforming conical spirals which are assemblies of specific ESCRT-III heteropolymers. To explore functional roles for ESCRT-III filaments, we examine HIV-1 Gag-mediated budding of virus-like particles and find that depleting Vps4 traps ESCRT-III filaments around nascent Gag assemblies. Interpolating between the observed structures suggests a new role for Vps4 in separating ESCRT-III from Gag or other cargo to allow centripetal growth of a neck constricting ESCRT-III spiral."

ESCRT-III filaments also accumulated as rings around the molecules destined for incorporation into a vesicle or virus. This indicated a new role for Vps4: it separates ESCRT-III from the contents of the vesicle, leaving it free to form a spiral that drives release of the vesicle or virus from the cell."

How cytoplasmic proteins cooperate to form vesicles that mediate transport between organelles is well defined. Less well understood is how cytoplasmic proteins drive the topologically reverse process of creating intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) in multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Studies over the past decade have shown that a set of over 30 proteins are responsible for ILV formation and are also required for the topologically similar processes of viral budding and cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hurley, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hanson and Cashikar, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sundquist and Krausslich, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Henne et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">McCullough et al., 2013</a>). Most are components of ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) complexes. The multisubunit ESCRT-0, -I, and -II complexes are thought to recognize cargo and initiate vesicle formation, while ESCRT-III proteins and the AAA+ ATPase Vps4 that acts on them promote membrane remodeling and scission both on MVBs and the plasma membrane. A subject of much current interest is how, exactly, ESCRT-III and Vps4 drive these events."

We find that ESCRT-III heteropolymers stabilized by depleting Vps4A & B are membrane-attached filaments that frequently spiral to delineate and fill circular domains \u223c110 nm in diameter. Many of these spirals induce conical deformations directed away from the cytoplasm. Filaments built from transfected proteins show that coassembly of two ESCRT-III proteins (in this case Snf7/CHMP4A and CHMP2A) is required to create membrane deforming ESCRT-III spirals. To define the relationship between ESCRT-III filaments and cargo, we studied HIV-1 Gag-driven virus-like-particle (VLP) assembly. Notably, in cells depleted of Vps4, we find that Gag assemblies are often encircled by ESCRT-III filaments. This suggests a previously unappreciated role for Vps4 in remodeling ESCRT-III around cargo-containing membrane domains in addition to its more canonical role in recycling ESCRT-III subunits."

Because these filaments resemble previously described ESCRT-III polymers, we used antibodies recognizing several ESCRT-III proteins and found that gold particles marking each of the proteins examined (CHMP6, CHMP2B, and CHMP1B) bound on or near filaments and filament spirals but not elsewhere on membranes from cells depleted of Vps4A &amp; B (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) or on membranes from control HeLa cells (not shown). Fortuitous immunodecoration inside broken but not fully unroofed Vps4-depleted cells showed that eversions containing ESCRT-III were also present along the cell's top surface (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1)</a>. The apparent distribution of different ESCRT-III proteins on the filament spirals was similar (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and not shown), although generally predominant labeling near the perimeter may reflect limited epitope accessibility toward the center of the spirals.

Other patterns including partial or complete rings and meandering filaments were also seen but were less common. The overall diameter of the spiral assemblies was 108 \u00b1 30 nm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), with an average of four 360\u00b0 turns in each spiral. The shape of the spirals on the membrane varied, ranging from clearly conical to flat. The total length of the filament in each spiral was 660 \u00b1 350 nm. While Vps4-driven remodeling may normally keep filaments from reaching this length (<a href=\"#bib62\">Teis et al., 2008</a>), these images set an upper limit on the size and shape of endogenous ESCRT-III polymer that is smaller and more uniform than that of the extensive polymers seen in vitro (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lata et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bajorek et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Henne et al., 2012</a>) or in cells overexpressing specific components of ESCRT-III (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hanson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bodon et al., 2011</a>). ESCRT-III assembly must therefore be controlled by something other than the availability of subunits. One possibility is that centripetal growth of a membrane-attached filament determines the diameter of the final assembly. Interestingly, ESCRT-III spirals surround and cover an area of membrane that corresponds well with that needed to generate a vesicle \u223c50 nm in diameter\u2014the typical size of ILVs in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Murk et al., 2003</a>)\u2014suggesting that an initial ESCRT-III circle might define the content of an incipient vesicle."

Filament width varied from 4 to as much as 15 nm in both conical and flat spirals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), excluding differences in accessibility to platinum deposition as a primary cause of the differences. Instead, differences in platinum decoration are likely to reveal variations in molecular structure (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bachmann et al., 1985</a>). Wider filaments\u2014sometimes with a split down their middle suggesting the presence of parallel substrands\u2014were most prevalent at the perimeter while thin filaments occurred throughout but were almost always present near the spirals' center. Filaments sometimes abruptly changed width (see examples highlighted in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) further supporting the presence of subfilaments within wider structures. Given the functional requirement for two ESCRT-III nucleating sites in ESCRT-II (<a href=\"#bib63\">Teis et al., 2010</a>) or Alix (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pires et al., 2009</a>), one possibility is that parallel filaments create the outer turns of a spiral but give way to single filaments with the potential for tighter curvature near the spiral's center. The ability of specific ESCRT-III proteins to cap filament assembly (<a href=\"#bib62\">Teis et al., 2008</a>) could promote transition from wide to narrow filaments by ending one of two (or more) parallel filaments. Understanding the functional significance and control of differences in filament content and shape will be an important question for the future."

While deep-etch EM does not have the resolution to define the arrangement of individual subunits, it allows us to compare filament shape and organization to that of filaments assembled in transfected cells. We previously found that overexpressed FLAG-tagged CHMP4 proteins create extensive networks of interconnected curved but flat filaments (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hanson et al., 2008</a>) and others have seen that CHMP4B and yeast Snf7 behave similarly in vitro (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pires et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Henne et al., 2012</a>). To rule out any effects of the acidic FLAG-tag at the N-terminus of CHMP4A in our earlier study (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hanson et al., 2008</a>), we examined filaments formed by untagged CHMP4A (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This was important because the FLAG-tag might specifically interfere with a recently described N-terminal membrane insertion motif in CHMP4-family proteins (<a href=\"#bib12\">Buchkovich et al., 2013</a>). As before, CHMP4A filaments circle and spiral along the membrane to form an anastomosing network but do not couple this to changes in membrane shape (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). CHMP4A filaments also remain flat when built from a constitutively \u2018open\u2019 CHMP4(\u03b11\u2013\u03b15) truncation mutant (<a href=\"#bib58\">Shim et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) or a K52E mutant that enhances Snf7 assembly in yeast (<a href=\"#bib31\">Henne et al., 2012</a>) (not shown). These consistently flat networks indicate that interface(s) needed to deform the membrane are either not present or not exposed in CHMP4 homopolymers even when intramolecular autoinhibitory contacts are released."

To test this idea, we examined the effect of coexpressing CHMP4A with CHMP2A based on the fact that the ESCRT-III function in a wide variety of pathways and organisms requires members of both the CHMP4 and CHMP2 subfamilies of proteins (<a href=\"#bib3\">Babst et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Morita et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib46\">2011</a>). Previous biochemical analyses showed that full-length CHMP4A and CHMP2A do not efficiently coassemble while heteropolymers form readily when either protein is activated by deleting its autoinhibitory domain (<a href=\"#bib58\">Shim et al., 2007</a>). Strikingly, membranes from cells co-expressing \u2018open\u2019 CHMP4A(\u03b11\u2013\u03b15) and full-length CHMP2A were studded with eversions lined by spiraling filaments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Corresponding eversions were apparent protruding from the tops of whole cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>); underlying filaments were revealed by delipidating fixed samples with detergent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Similar membrane-deforming filaments developed when we coexpressed full-length CHMP4A with \u2018open\u2019 CHMP2A(\u03b11\u2013\u03b15) (not shown), demonstrating that the shape changes do not depend on C-terminal autoinhibitory sequences in either protein. The fact that ESCRT-III heteropolymers differ from the sum of their parts supports a model in which subunits such as CHMP2A coassemble with CHMP4 to change the structure of the filament and its effects on membrane shape. Similar changes in filament morphology were previously seen with purified proteins in vitro (<a href=\"#bib31\">Henne et al., 2012</a>) suggesting that distinctive heteropolymer shape may be a general feature of ESCRT-III biology. An important question for the future will be to define how recruitment and assembly of appropriate ESCRT-III subunits is regulated to create the requisite polymer shape."

If spirals represent \u2018scars\u2019 left behind after vesicle budding, they have separated from the vesicles they helped to create. An alternative possibility is that spirals represent the preferred arrangement of ESCRT-III when it assembles spontaneously as a \u2018blank\u2019 in the absence of cargo (and Vps4). Efforts to see ESCRT-III spirals on the surface of endosomes where their function in vesicle biogenesis is better defined were complicated by poor retention and accessibility of these organelles to deep-etch EM as well as the development of stacked class E compartments similar to those seen in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nickerson et al., 2006</a>, and not shown). We therefore turned to the best-characterized ESCRT-dependent event at the plasma membrane, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) budding. HIV-1 assembly is driven by polymerization of the virally encoded Gag polyprotein, which recruits cellular ESCRT proteins to facilitate virion release from the plasma membrane and can be expressed alone to produce virus-like particles (VLPs) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gheysen et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Karacostas et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sundquist and Krausslich, 2012</a>). Current thinking based on electron tomography of immature virions (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wright et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Carlson et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Briggs et al., 2009</a>) and bud sites (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carlson et al., 2008</a>) is that ESCRTs and especially ESCRT-III play important roles both in completing the viral sphere (that is only 2/3 covered by polymerized Gag) and in severing its connection to the cell. ESCRT-III and Vps4 are transiently recruited to Gag assemblies to mediate release (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jouvenet et al., 2011</a>). This machinery is typically thought to act on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane to constrict the vesicle neck and release a viral particle (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sundquist and Krausslich, 2012</a>), although a recent study using fluorescently labeled proteins and superresolution imaging raised the possibility of similar constriction from within the viral particle (<a href=\"#bib20\">Van Engelenburg et al., 2014</a>). Using deep-etch EM allows us to capture snapshots of this process while assessing the relationship between ESCRT-III and HIV-1 Gag as a readily recognizable cargo."

Release of VLPs was corroborated by fluorescence microscopy of cells expressing Gag-GFP (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and by isolation and immunoblotting of VLPs (not shown). Unroofed plasma membranes display unique circular and semi-spherical protein assemblies ranging in size up to the diameter of VLPs that appear to be nascent Gag assemblies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In order to ascertain that these in fact contain Gag, we immunodecorated unroofed cells with an antibody specific to the membrane-proximal matrix (MA) domain of Gag (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013H</a>). Gold particles were numerous around putative Gag assemblies on unroofed plasma membranes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,E\u2032</a>) and around VLPs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,F\u2032</a>) when samples were delipidated by detergent extraction after fixation. When membranes were intact, immunodecoration of Gag assemblies was limited to their perimeter (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,G\u2032</a>) and was abolished in released VLPs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>) as expected. By deep-etch EM, Gag-GFP assemblies were less uniform in size and shape than those containing Gag (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), consistent with the irregular distribution of Gag-GFP seen by thin section EM (<a href=\"#bib54\">Pornillos et al., 2003</a>) and with the decreased Gag content of VLPs containing Gag fused to similarly sized fluorescent proteins (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gunzenhauser et al., 2012</a>). Notably there was no evidence by direct viewing or immunolabeling (not shown) to indicate the presence of ESCRT-III on or near any of these Gag assemblies.

As expected, expressing a dominant negative mutant of Vps4A (Vps4A E228Q) or silencing Vps4 as above increased the amount of Gag-GFP (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) or Gag (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) on the plasma membrane and decreased release of VLPs as detected by particle analysis methods (data not shown). Strikingly, in cells lacking Vps4 Gag assemblies on the plasma membrane were now often surrounded by a single filament not seen in control cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The encircling filaments appeared similar to the ESCRT-III filaments examined above, each ranging from 4.5\u201312.8 nm (average 8.6 \u00b1 1.6 nm, n = 96) in width with the majority wide enough to contain more than one \u223c4 nm substrand. Immunolabeling confirmed that ESCRT-III proteins localized to the perimeter of Gag assemblies coincident with the filaments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Interestingly, the encircling filaments surrounded Gag assemblies of various sizes ranging from \u223c60\u2013150 nm suggesting that the threshold amount of Gag needed to activate ESCRT-III assembly may be decreased in the setting of reduced Vps4 leading to premature nucleation of the ESCRT-III ring. Alternatively, these smaller Gag assemblies may indicate a role for ESCRT-III filaments in confining Gag (or other cargo proteins) in a domain that normally expands upon remodeling by Vps4. More deeply invaginated Gag assemblies were sometimes surrounded by what appeared to be tightly spiraled ESCRT-III filaments, and immunolabeling confirmed that ESCRT-III was present on the cytoplasmic rim and surrounding surface of these invaginating VLPs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, right panel and not shown). These spirals may correspond to the darkly stained ring previously noted in thin section EM analysis of HIV-1 budding from cells depleted of CHMP2A (and therefore unable to engage Vps4) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Morita et al., 2011</a>) and seem likely to represent trapped intermediates in the biogenesis of VLPs."

We noticed that ESCRT-III filaments (in cells depleted of Vps4) were frequently connected to the central Gag assembly by perpendicular \u2018struts\u2019 \u223c14 nm long (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, see green highlighting in inset). These struts resemble previous negative stain images of purified Alix bound perpendicularly to Snf7 filaments (<a href=\"#bib53\">Pires et al., 2009</a>) although based on size they could also correspond to ESCRT-I (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boura et al., 2011</a>), an ESCRT-I-ESCRT-II supercomplex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boura et al., 2012</a>), or something else altogether. The C-terminal p6 domain of Gag contains a PTAP motif (essential for interaction with the ESCRT-I protein Tsg101 [<a href=\"#bib24\">Garrus et al., 2001</a>]) and a LYPX<sub>n</sub>L motif (involved in interaction with ALIX [<a href=\"#bib60\">Strack et al., 2003</a>]) and has been shown to be essential for budding of Gag VLPs as well as HIV-1. To determine whether these motifs are required for ESCRT-III recruitment, we deleted the p6 domain from Gag (referred to as Gag\u0394p6). In cells expressing Gag\u0394p6, very few VLPs were released and instead large numbers of arrested Gag-containing buds accumulated on the surface (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and not shown). Importantly, this was true regardless of whether Vps4 was present or not, confirming that the p6 domain is required for VLP release. On unroofed plasma membranes Gag assemblies similar to those formed by full-length Gag were observed but were not surrounded by ESCRT-III rings (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), demonstrating that p6 sequences are required to recruit ESCRT-III. Furthermore, no struts were apparent, consistent with the hypothesis that these correspond to ESCRT-I and/or Alix. We were, however, unable to confirm the identity of the struts because available antibodies were unsuitable. Detailed mutagenesis coupled with antibodies appropriate for immunodecoration on these samples will be needed to conclusively identify these structures."

Earlier studies of various ESCRT-III polymers in vitro and in transfected cells inspired thinking about how different filamentous and tubular structures might function in vesicle biogenesis and membrane scission. Ideas ranged from purse-string like constriction of a ring (<a href=\"#bib55\">Saksena et al., 2009</a>) to polymer-driven membrane buckling (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lenz et al., 2009</a>) to the more prevalent dome-based membrane scission model (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fabrikant et al., 2009</a>) and its variants (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boura et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Elia et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Henne et al., 2012</a>). We propose a modified model that builds on many of these previous ideas, interpolating between the rings of ESCRT-III we see around HIV-1 Gag assemblies and the completed conical spirals that accumulate on the membrane (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). In this model, a first role for ESCRT-III is to encircle and thereby delineate cargo and membrane destined for inclusion in a vesicle or VLP (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The encircling filament develops when nucleating factors activated by cargo form struts around a central domain and in turn recruit ESCRT-III. Either because of intrinsic filament curvature or because of multiple contacts with cargo, ESCRT-III filaments grow to surround the cargo (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Because encircled Gag assemblies uniquely accumulate when Vps4 is missing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), we propose that an important and previously unappreciated role for Vps4 is to release connection(s) between the ESCRT-III filament and cargo, perhaps displacing the struts while also opening the ring. The ESCRT-III filament can then grow to adopt its preferred shape as a conical spiral (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) potentially driving neck constriction and vesicle release as shown (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Finally (and not shown), Vps4 is also responsible for disassembling ESCRT-III filaments to recycle their subunits during or after vesicle release."

Interestingly, there are similarities between the different forms of ESCRT-III seen here and structures previously described by EM of purified yeast proteins (<a href=\"#bib31\">Henne et al., 2012</a>). Specifically, Henne et al. found that combining ESCRT-II as a nucleating factor with ESCRT-III proteins (Vps20 and Snf7 or a combination of four core ESCRT-III proteins) generated rings of ESCRT-III \u223c50\u201370 nm in diameter, appropriate for surrounding a domain needed to create 25\u201335 nm ILVs characteristic of yeast MVBs. In our images, the \u223c110 nm average outer diameter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) of ESCRT-III spirals would in an analogous manner support formation of the \u223c50 nm vesicles typical of mammalian ILVs and extracellular vesicles. Henne et al. also found that combining ESCRT-III proteins with each other in the absence of ESCRT-II created spring-like three-dimensional coils. Not clear was whether (and how) rings might convert into spiraling filaments. We suggest that Vps4 may have a general role in converting a cargo confining ring to a vesicle-generating spiral, likely by separating ESCRT-III from nucleating factors seen as struts in our model. The idea that Vps4 plays specific and essential roles both before and after membrane scission is supported by a number of observations. Fluorescently tagged Vps4 is recruited to growing viral particles before they are released (<a href=\"#bib7\">Baumgartel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jouvenet et al., 2011</a>), Vps4 appears at two stages prior to cellular abscission (<a href=\"#bib18\">Elia et al., 2011</a>), ESCRT-III and Vps4 are recruited simultaneously to the centroid of dividing <i>Crenarchaea</i> (<a href=\"#bib56\">Samson et al., 2011</a>), and perturbing Vps4 function and/or regulation changes ILV size and/or release in yeast (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nickerson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wemmer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adell et al., 2014</a>)."

Defining the detailed temporal relationship between Vps4 activity and ESCRT-III assembly during virus or vesicle formation will be particularly important. Additionally, while we have taken advantage of the fact that ESCRT polymers are present on the plasma membrane to facilitate deep-etch EM imaging, future studies of their function at the plasma membrane are clearly warranted. Overall, the work described here establishes that endogenous ESCRT-III takes the form of filaments that form circles and conical spirals on the membrane. We propose that these rings and spirals, while longer-lived than normal, represent functional states of a general ESCRT-III membrane scission machine."

VPS4A/B-depleted cells are used to prevent rapid ESCRT-III filament disassembly and to arrest VLP budding. The study makes four important claims: 1) Conical spiraling filaments of ESCRT-III proteins can be observed at the plasma membranes of cells lacking Vps4 proteins. 2) Spiraling ESCRT filaments assemble at the necks of nascent VLPs. This observation supports the dominant model that ESCRT-III filaments mediate membrane scission at the bud neck, but is the first compelling visualization of those filaments. 3) The ESCRT filaments act from the cytosolic face of the bud. This configuration has been assumed in other models, but there has been little direct evidence for this topology and the idea is not universally accepted. This is therefore also an important observation. Indeed, the authors probably understate the importance of this observation and it should be discussed more thoroughly and in light of the recent Science paper from the Lippincott-Schwartz lab). 4) Co-overexpression of activated CHMP4A and CHMP2A proteins induces the extrusion of membrane tubes on the plasma membrane, implying that CHMP2A provides extrusion activity to CHMP4A. All of these observations appear to be consistent with the dome model for membrane constriction and fission, at least in general terms. Although this is already the leading model in the field, there has been little direct experimental evidence to support or refute it and the contributions are therefore important and warrant publication in <i>eLife</i>. As detailed below, however, there are still a series of key scientific and presentation issues that need to be address prior to publication."

B) The authors should image the assemblies formed by Gag proteins that lack the TSG101 (PTAP) and YPXL (ALIX) binding sites. This experiment is expected to produce Gag assemblies lacking ESCRT rings and would greatly strengthen the claim that the encircling rings are indeed ESCRT assemblies.

An alternative explanation is that the structures seen here represent overgrowths due to unchecked ESCRT-III polymerization in the absence of Vps4 activity. We therefore recommend discussing this issue and removing the term \u201cfunctional\u201d throughout and replacing it with a more nuanced discussion placing these structures in context with others. A related issue is that the authors should consider whether Vps4 functions might include: A) detaching ESCRT components from \u201ccargo\u201d (as suggested, although strictly speaking, is \u201ccargo\u201d is the right term for Gag?), and B) preventing the formation of the overgrown structures that are being imaged here."

We have added a sentence describing the range of diameters that we observe for Gag assemblies, but do not think that quantifying their relative frequency makes sense because cell-to-cell variability in Gag expression is significant in transiently transfected cells and may affect the concentration and distribution of the resulting Gag assemblies. We cannot directly quantify this relationship using unroofed plasma membranes because we do not know how much Gag was present in the intact cell. To circumvent this problem, we attempted to make tetracycline-inducible stable Gag-expressing cell lines so that every cell would express approximately the same amount. Three separate attempts to generate these were unsuccessful, apparently because the amount of Gag expressed did not reach the threshold needed to assemble VLPs."
