                    "text": "Human lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) contain mutations in <i>EGFR</i> in \u223c15% of cases and in <i>KRAS</i> in \u223c30%, yet no individual adenocarcinoma appears to carry activating mutations in both genes, a finding we have confirmed by re-analysis of data from over 600 LUAD. Here we provide evidence that co-occurrence of mutations in these two genes is deleterious. In transgenic mice programmed to express both mutant oncogenes in the lung epithelium, the resulting tumors express only one oncogene. We also show that forced expression of a second oncogene in human cancer cell lines with an endogenous mutated oncogene is deleterious. The most prominent features accompanying loss of cell viability were vacuolization, other changes in cell morphology, and increased macropinocytosis. Activation of ERK, p38 and JNK in the dying cells suggests that an overly active MAPK signaling pathway may mediate the phenotype. Together, our findings indicate that mutual exclusivity of oncogenic mutations may reveal unexpected vulnerabilities and therapeutic possibilities."

Here we provide evidence that co-occurrence of mutations in these two genes is deleterious. In transgenic mice programmed to express both mutant oncogenes in the lung epithelium, the resulting tumors express only one oncogene. We also show that forced expression of a second oncogene in human cancer cell lines with an endogenous mutated oncogene is deleterious. The most prominent features accompanying loss of cell viability were vacuolization, other changes in cell morphology, and increased macropinocytosis. Activation of ERK, p38 and JNK in the dying cells suggests that an overly active MAPK signaling pathway may mediate the phenotype. Together, our findings indicate that mutual exclusivity of oncogenic mutations may reveal unexpected vulnerabilities and therapeutic possibilities."

This finding is especially provocative because of the frequencies of mutant alleles of <i>KRAS</i> and <i>EGFR</i> occurring separately in LUAD: \u223c30% for <i>KRAS</i> mutations and \u223c15% for <i>EGFR</i> mutations (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</a>). The explanation generally provided for the mutual exclusivity is that the products of these two loci operate in the same or overlapping signaling pathways and hence are functionally redundant. However, this idea has not been experimentally tested, and there is reason to question its validity. For example, since they are differently positioned in a signaling network (EGFR senses and transmits external signals from the cell membrane; RAS serves as a cytosolic node), the consequences of the mutations would not be expected to be identical. Hence mutations in both genes might be expected to offer a selective advantage over a mutation in just one of them. Furthermore, and tellingly, KRAS mutations are rarely, if ever, encountered in mutant EGFR-driven tumors that become resistant to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), when a \u2018downstream\u2019 mutation in <i>KRAS</i> would be expected to provide a strong selective advantage (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yu et al., 2013</a>)."

In this study, we aimed to determine whether an inhibitory phenotype can account for the mutual exclusivity of <i>KRAS</i> and <i>EGFR</i> mutations in LUAD and to characterize the specific cellular effects that result from co-expression of both mutant alleles in lung cancer cells. Through analysis of available sequences of human tumor samples, generation of transgenic mouse models that express mutant KRAS and EGFR in the lung epithelium, and functional tests of these mutant genes in cultured tumor cells, we conclude that synthetic lethality is responsible for the mutually exclusive nature of activating mutations in these genes. We propose that this type of gene interaction may reveal vulnerabilities in lung and other cancers that suggest novel therapeutic strategies."

Since these two genes are in the same pathway and activate similar downstream targets, it is generally assumed that there is no selective pressure to favor cells with both mutations over cells with a mutation in one of them. If complete functional redundancy explains the mutual exclusivity of these mutations, assessing a large panel of samples might reveal tumors with both genes mutated. To this end, we reviewed published somatic mutation data for <i>EGFR</i> and <i>KRAS</i> from 662 LUAD that were profiled as part of four separate studies (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ding et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Imielinski et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Seo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014</a>).

In total, 186 (28.2%) and 110 (16.6%) tumors had somatic mutations that changed the amino acid sequences (non-silent mutations) of KRAS and EGFR proteins, respectively\u2014frequencies similar to those previously reported (<a href=\"#bib20\">Heist and Engelman, 2012</a>).

These factors make predictions complex. In the simplest terms, if we define mutations in these genes as independent events with similar selective advantage that occur at a specific frequency across the population of tumors\u2014and assume that they are not influenced by the factors stated above\u2014the expected co-incidence of the mutations can be derived from a simple calculation (used in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, panel A). On these terms, we would anticipate that that approximately 31 tumors in the cohort presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> would contain mutations in both genes. However, we observed only a single tumor in which this was the case; moreover, the EGFR mutation (R574L) in this tumor (which also harbored a KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> mutation) has not been previously identified as oncogenic, lies outside the kinase domain and hence is unlikely to be activating (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). A left-tailed 2X2 Fisher's Exact Test indicates a significant negative association between the mutations (p = 8.62e<sup>\u221217</sup>), confirming the mutually exclusive nature of these mutant alleles. Furthermore, even when analyzing tumors from smokers and never-smokers separately\u2014which are known to have different frequencies of mutations in <i>KRAS</i> and <i>EGFR</i>\u2014a statistically significant negative association between the co-occurrence of mutations in these genes was still observed (p = 4.43e<sup>\u221210</sup> and p = 0.002, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Our failure to identify any tumors with co-existing oncogenic mutations of these two genes in this combined data set strengthened the possibility that the observed mutual exclusivity might imply more than functional redundancy\u2014for example, a toxic effect of co-existing oncogenic mutations."

To do this, we devised a method that explores whole-exome DNA sequencing data on a global scale.

However, if selective pressures are involved, so that dual mutation enhances or restricts cell growth or survival, the value for a given gene will fall either above or below this line. If the additive effect confers a selective advantage, and a mutation of the second gene occurs more frequently in combination with the mutant proto-oncogene than expected, the result is displayed as a red dot (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; see legend for details).

However, the confidence in any selective effect, reflected by a low p-value, should not be confused with the strength of the effect, since the number of mutations will influence the p-value. Therefore, since the numbers of mutations for the great majority of genes are relatively small in our data sets, we can place only a modest degree of confidence on the selective effects. However, in some cases, for example, TP53 plus KRAS mutations, there may be a highly significant but still relatively minor deviation from expected rates of co-occurrence. The deviations of greatest interest are therefore caused by those combinations of mutations, such as KRAS plus EGFR, that produce a major deviation from expectation at a high level of confidence because both genes are frequently mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>; discussed further in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

However, our laboratory has previously demonstrated in a mouse model of breast cancer that two oncogenic transgenes, <i>TetO-Kras</i><sup><i>G12D</i></sup> and <i>TetO-Myc,</i> can be co-expressed in mammary tumors at levels similar to those observed in tumors from transgenic animals containing only one of the transgenes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Podsypanina et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, in other tri-transgenic mice carrying the same <i>CCSP-rtTA</i> transgene, most if not all tumors expressing the oncogenic <i>TetO-EGFR</i><sup><i>L858R</i></sup> transgene also expressed a <i>TetO-Cre</i> transgene, as judged by elimination of a floxed <i>Erbb3</i> allele (<a href=\"#bib47\">Song et al., 2015</a>).

Expanding the use of the qRT-PCR assay to examine over 90 tumor nodules from 14 mice, 8 of which were tri-transgenics, confirmed that tumors from tri-transgenic mice almost always contained RNA from a single transgenic oncogene, either <i>EGFR</i> or <i>Kras</i>, and the amounts of RNA were similar to those found in tumors from the bi-transgenic animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In some tri-transgenic mice (e.g., mouse number 687), all nodules contained only <i>EGFR</i> transgenic RNA while nodules from some others expressed only <i>Kras</i> transgenic RNA (e.g., mouse number 685). Furthermore, there were animals in which a different transgene, <i>Kras</i> or <i>EGFR,</i> was expressed in individual tumor nodules (e.g., mouse number 798), implying that tumors from mice carrying oncogenic alleles of both <i>Kras</i> and <i>EGFR</i> have evolved by selecting against cells that express both mutant transgenes, further suggesting that expression of both these genes is detrimental."

To address the latter possibility, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to ask whether <i>EGFR</i> and <i>Kras</i> transgenes are expressed in the same cells by assessing levels of human EGFR and by measuring phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) as readout of MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling. This analysis, however, cannot definitely address co-expression as the intensity of p-ERK signaling may be enhanced by induction of either transgene alone. Tumors from bi-transgenic animals with the <i>EGFR</i> transgene scored positive for both human EGFR and p-ERK (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), while tumors from bi-transgenic <i>Kras</i> animals scored positive only for p-ERK (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

This general concept could have important implications for the design of therapeutic strategies, as well as tumor evolution. Recent efforts to design new treatments have focused on mutant genes that, when inhibited, decrease the viability of cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sawyers, 2009</a>).

No other mutated pairs of genes demonstrated a similarly negative association in lung adenocarcinoma, further arguing that the mutual exclusivity of <i>KRAS</i> and <i>EGFR</i> mutations is due to negative selection.

However, we note that this analysis was confined to alleles with altered sequences in coding domains and did not include gene rearrangements and amplifications. Thus we cannot draw conclusions about whether certain kinds of combinations, such as amplification of one proto-oncogene and sequence mutation of another, create synthetic lethalities. Moreover, the data sets we examined were derived by profiling cancers from patients who had not received medical treatment; hence the relationship of drugs or drug resistance to synthetic lethality has not been examined, and we would not have detected the recently reported amplification of wild type <i>KRAS</i> in a COAD with a mutant <i>BRAF</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahronian et al., 2015</a>)."

We found that the expression of both oncogenes caused the death of lung cancer cells within a week, mostly in a non-canonical manner. While we observed some markers of classical apoptosis and autophagy and small changes in cell cycle distribution in one line, the dominant features were cell enlargement and vacuolization, activation of stress-associated protein kinases (as judged by phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK), and increased macropinocytosis, with a subsequent loss of cell viability."

Expression of H-Ras<sup>G12V</sup> in glioblastoma and gastric cancer cell lines generates vacuoles associated with increased cell death (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chi et al., 1999</a>), a phenomenon dubbed \u2018methuosis\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Maltese and Overmeyer, 2014</a>). These findings were subsequently linked to induction of uncontrolled macropinocytosis though activation of the Rac1 GTP-binding protein (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bhanot et al., 2010</a>). More recently, a small molecule screen for inhibitors of glioblastoma cell lines identified a quinine derivative (vacquinol-1) that induced cell vacuoles, membrane ruffling, and increased macropinocytosis, similar to the effects of RAS activation alone (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kitambi et al., 2014</a>). This process was found to be dependent on MKK4, part of the MAP2K family, that can phosphorylate both p38 and JNK (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kitambi et al., 2014</a>). As Rac1 is known to activate both p38 and JNK kinase pathways (<a href=\"#bib13\">Coso et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Minden et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Olson et al., 1995</a>) these findings imply the existence of a common mechanism whereby RAS-mediated activation of Rac1 stimulates p38 and JNK, prompting uncontrolled macropinocytosis, vacuolization, and subsequent cell death. Despite these supportive studies, however, the findings that implicate JNK and p38 pathways in the mechanism of synthetic lethality induced by mutant KRAS and EGFR co-expression are only correlative at this point. Additional studies will be needed to determine whether activation of one or both of these pathways is required for cell death and whether it causes or results from macropinocytosis and vacuolization."

In the context of active EGFR and KRAS, it is possible that both mutant alleles together increase RAS-MAPK-mediated signaling beyond a tolerable threshold, resulting in increased activation of Rac1 and subsequent stimulation of p38 and JNK, kinases that are not typically activated to high levels by mutant KRAS or EGFR alone. Indeed, our data demonstrate increased activation of KRAS signaling and activation of stress kinases p38 and JNK upon co-induction of mutant KRAS and EGFR. Furthermore, these signaling events may be accompanied by, uncontrolled macropinocytosis, resulting in the accumulation of macropinosomes in the cytosol that overwhelm the capacity of the cells to adapt to the presence of large vacuoles. Thus, unlike a situation in which macropinocytosis favors cell survival, this would result in cell death. Future work will be required to determine the biochemical details of this process, such as the role of Rac1, and to test whether the observed mutual exclusivity of other combinations of mutant genes in other tumor types are attributable to such mechanisms."

Tumor cells acquire resistance to these compounds through multiple mechanisms, including a second-site mutation (T790M) in <i>EGFR</i>, amplification of <i>MET</i> or <i>ERBB2,</i> and conversion to a small cell lung cancer phenotype (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yu et al., 2013</a>). Our findings and those from other groups (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sharifnia et al., 2014</a>) demonstrate that mutant <i>KRAS</i> can also confer resistance to TKIs in <i>EGFR</i> mutant cell lines. Yet mutations in <i>KRAS</i> have not been found to explain acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in patients (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ohashi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yu et al., 2013</a>). Synthetic lethality could explain this observation. Acquired resistance is generally caused by the selection of a minor clone initially present in a heterogenous tumor, in which the resistance mutation exists in a subset of cells prior to TKI treatment. However, if expression of both mutant <i>EGFR</i> and mutant <i>KRAS</i> is detrimental, co-mutated cells are unlikely to survive during tumor evolution; therefore, they are unlikely to explain TKI resistance in an <i>EGFR</i>-mutant tumor."

These findings may have major implications for the future development of new agonistic treatment strategies for a substantial fraction of lung cancers driven by mutant KRAS or EGFR."

All studies assessed the entire coding region of these genes in tumors and in matched normal specimens, and they provide information regarding the somatic mutation status (single nucleotide changes, small insertions and deletions) for 662 LUAD in total.

Redundant samples were removed to yield data for 520 unique tumor samples. All variants not mapping to coding regions were removed, and the resulting data files were parsed to stratify samples according to non-silent mutation (insertions/deletions, non-synonymous nucleotide variants) status of a given proto-oncogene. The silent (synonymous nucleotide variant) and non-silent mutation status for all other genes was then determined separately on a sample by sample basis and compared to those samples with non-silent mutations to determine the number of times the gene is mutated in a tumor with or without the mutated proto-oncogene. The resulting values for each gene (the number of samples with mutations in a gene and the proto-oncogene, number of samples with mutation in the gene and not the proto-oncogene, number of samples without mutations in the gene and with mutation in proto-oncogene, and number of samples without mutation in either) were then compared using the Fisher's Exact Test function in R (<a href=\"http://www.r-project.org/\">http://www.r-project.org/</a>).

Cells were gradually dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions (35%, 50%, 75%, 95%, and 100%). Cells were washed in a pure epoxy resin three times after 100% ethanol, and then embedded in the resin. The resin was cured in an oven (55\u00b0C) for 48 hr. The cured resin blocks were separated from the plate by submerging in liquid nitrogen. The cells were examined under an inverted microscope and areas selected for preparing 80 to 90 nm sections, which were then mounted on 200 copper mesh grids and counter-stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The grids were carbon coated in a vacuum evaporator. The grids were examined and imaged in the electron microscope operated at 80 kv and digital images were captured by a CCD camera."

Sample quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and subsequent sample preparation, array hybridization, and data acquisition was performed by the National Human Genome Research Institute's Microarray Core facility. GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were used according to the manufacture's protocols. Raw data (Affymetrix CEL files) were normalized by robust multiarray analysis (<a href=\"#bib23\">Irizarry et al., 2003</a>) and subsequently analyzed to detect genes differentially expressed between dox-treated and untreated cultures, using the ANOVA function in Partek Genomics Suite software (Partek, St. Louis, MO); a Benjamini\u2013Hochberg corrected p value of &lt;0.01 was considered significant. Overlap between differentially expressed genes among the cell lines was determined using VENNY software (<a href=\"#bib36\">Oliveros, 2007</a>) and those significantly deregulated upon the addition of dox in both H358-TetO-EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> and PC9-TetO-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells and not their respective TetO-GFP controls were selected for further analyses. DNA probes that detected significant differences were mapped to genes using Partek Genomics Suite; those not mapping to annotated genes were removed. An average fold-change for dox treated vs untreated H358-TetO-EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> and PC9-TetO-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cells was calculated and these values, along with the corresponding probe IDs, were uploaded to IPA software (Ingenuity Systems, Qiagen) and analyzed using the Canonical Pathways function. Canonical pathways with a z-score \u22650.25 and a p value \u22640.05 were considered activated, whereas those with a z-score \u2264 \u22120.25 and a p value \u22640.05 were considered inactivated. GSEA (<a href=\"#bib48\">Subramanian et al., 2005</a>) was also performed on the same gene list using the pre-ranked GSEA function and the transcription factor targets gene sets within the C6: Oncogenic Signatures Collection from the Molecular Signature Database (<a href=\"#bib48\">Subramanian et al., 2005</a>). Genes were ranked according to their average fold change for the dox treated TetO-Oncogene cells (described above) and GSEA was run with default settings except \u2018Min size: exclude smaller set = 10\u2019."

Importantly, they were unable to find similar associations between other commonly occurring mutations in this tumor type suggesting that their co-existence is detrimental. Further the authors demonstrate using transgenic mouse models that simultaneous induction of these mutated oncogenes resulted overwhelmingly with tumors that carry either mutated genes but not both. This exclusivity was further documented in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, in which co-expression of these oncogenes resulted in loss of viability, vacuolization, and evidence of macropinocytosis and autophagy. These intriguing results, however, were not further pursued at the mechanistic level, which was explicitly stated to be beyond the scope of the current work. Nonetheless, molecular signatures of cells co-expressing these oncogenes revealed activation of MAPK/JNK pathways. Whether co-expression of these oncogenes resulted in profound metabolic stress would be of great interest in future studies. In particular, whether autophagy is a survival or a death mechanism in this model remains to be established. The reported findings have significance regarding the evolution of human tumors and potential have implications for the application of targeted therapies. The work is high quality and would be of interest to <i>eLife</i> readers."

First, it should be noted that our study looked only at sequence level mutation and not copy number status, an important consideration in the context of the work by Corcoran and colleagues. Thus, we would not record the co-incidence of oncogenic mutation of BRAF with amplification of KRAS in colorectal cancers or similar relationships between oncogenes in other cancer types. However, it should be noted that mutation and amplification, while both \u201cactivating\u201d in their effect on oncogenes, work through different mechanisms and are likely to have different effects on signaling. For example, unlike lung adenocarcinomas with sequence-altering mutations of EGFR, tumors with amplifications of EGFR do not acutely respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This finding and others suggest that mutations in EGFR potentiate signaling to a greater degree than amplification of wild-type EGFR. Therefore, in the context of synthetic lethality, when signaling intensity may need to exceed thresholds to induce toxicity, a combination of mutation of one oncogene and amplification of another may not create mutual exclusivity even though other mutational combinations might do so. Thus, as described in the paper by Corcoran and colleagues, a pre-existing population of cells within a tumor may carry both a BRAF mutation and KRAS amplification and those cells would have a selective advantage that upon treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Likewise, since our study examined tumors before treatment, it is possible that oncogenic alleles that appear to be excluded by the presence of certain mutations in the cancer types we examined may occur and be tolerated upon treatment with targeted therapies. Since we tested directly only the lethality of EGFR and KRAS mutations, we cannot exclude these and other possibilities. We pointed out in our original manuscript the need for such direct tests of the mechanism of observed mutual exclusivities."

To determine if inhibition of JNK and p38 can rescue the lethality observed upon co-expression of mutant EGFR and KRAS, we performed several experiments with siRNAs and small molecule inhibitors directed at these kinases in cells, using the inducible cell lines previously deployed in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> of our original manuscript. While we observed some amelioration of the lethal effects of induction of a second oncogene, there were confounding issues with these experiments that precluded adding them to the manuscript. First, while described as specific inhibitors for JNK and p38, the compounds used, like other small molecules, are known to affect the activity of other proteins (kinases) as well. Thus, it is difficult to attribute the effects observed solely to inhibition of the targeted kinases and not additional off-target effects. Second, as both JNK and p38 have multiple family members (i.e. JNK1-3 and p38 alpha, beta, gamma and delta) that mediate their signaling cascades, we could not reliably silence all family members concurrently with siRNAs."

To summarize, we believe that the increased signaling induced by co-expression of both mutant oncogenes promotes macropinocytosis to levels or durations greater than those seen with expression of KRAS alone, resulting in profound cell defects such as vacuolization (Discussion)."
