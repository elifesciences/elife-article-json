                        "text": "The diverse gene expression programs that allow for differentiation and response to environmental stimuli result from the regulated binding of transcription factors to DNA. The prevalent technique used in chromatin biology for mapping protein\u2013DNA interactions is chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), but little has changed since it was first described 27 years ago (<a href=\"#bib15\">Solomon et al., 1988</a>). Despite recent advances in read-out technologies for ChIP, such as high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), the basic chromatin preparation protocol remains the same and has a number of limitations. For example, sonication is typically used to fragment the chromatin. This however, has been shown to be non-random, with heterochromatic regions showing increased resistance to fragmentation leading to bias in the experiment (<a href=\"#bib17\">Teytelman et al., 2009</a>). In addition, sonication typically produces chromatin fragments between 200 and 500 bp, whereas the footprint of a typical chromatin-associated protein is \u223c10-fold smaller, indicating a lack of resolution currently obtained by ChIP-seq. Even extensive sonication only yields fragments with an average length of 200 bp, suggesting that sonication is of limited use in generating high-resolution maps of genome-wide protein binding (<a href=\"#bib2\">Fan et al., 2008</a>). In a previous study, we were interested in how RNA Polymerase II transcribes through nucleosomes at the promoter (<a href=\"#bib14\">Skene et al., 2014</a>). Answering this question required the precise mapping of PolII with respect to the position of nucleosomes, but conventional ChIP-seq that uses sonication to fragment the chromatin, yields fragments approximately twice the size of a nucleosome. Additionally, it has been shown that PolII can crosslink to nearby nucleosomes and therefore mapping the immunoprecipitated DNA fragments from these composite PolII:nucleosome:DNA complexes fails to precisely map the position of PolII on the DNA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Koerber et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Skene et al., 2014</a>). By using micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to digest unprotected DNA, we were able to achieve high resolution in a ChIP experiment, mapping the precise location of PolII and chromatin remodelers on the DNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; a detailed protocol is provided as a <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Skene et al., 2014</a>). Optimization of this simple protocol for the high-resolution mapping of protein\u2013DNA interactions has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of genome-wide protein binding. High resolution is especially a requirement at closely spaced transcription factor binding sites, such as locus control regions and super-enhancers, which have been shown to be vital to cell fate decisions and human diseases (<a href=\"#bib5\">Hnisz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Pott and Lieb, 2014</a>)."

The non-uniform distribution indicates a bias with the distinct peak at the TSS arising from non-random chromatin fragmentation, with a high probability of having a right end just downstream of the TSS. The input data set from modENCODE ID#3953 (GSE47229) was used. Due to the sonication bias, it is clear that the sonicated fragments do not represent the minimally protected DNA footprint, and as such the length of the recovered DNA fragments provides no information."

Initially, we focused on mapping PolII at the transcriptional start site (TSS) in <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells, where there are existing data sets at both low and high resolution. We performed high-resolution X-ChIP-seq using the same antibody against total PolII (Rpb3 subunit) as previously used by a conventional sonication ChIP experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Core et al., 2012</a>). Using this cell line also allowed a comparison with the single base-pair resolution technique that maps the last ribonucleotide incorporated into the nascent RNA chain (3\u2032NT), thereby mapping the exact position of the PolII active site (<a href=\"#bib18\">Weber et al., 2014</a>). By using paired-end sequencing, we can selectively study specific lengths of immunoprecipitated fragments. Analyzing sequenced fragments with lengths 20\u201370 bp, which more closely represent the footprint of PolII (<a href=\"#bib13\">Samkurashvili and Luse, 1996</a>), avoids the complication of mapping fragments consisting of PolII crosslinked to adjacent nucleosomes. Using this technique, we find that the maximal peak of PolII signal coincides with the position of the polymerase's active site at \u223c+35 bp, as measured by 3\u2032NT. This is consistent with evidence suggesting that the vast majority of <i>Drosophila</i> genes have a productively engaged PolII enzyme stalled just downstream of the promoter rather than PolII stably bound at the pre-initiation complex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Core et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, PolII distribution as measured by conventional ChIP with the chromatin fragmented by sonication, shows a distinct distribution at the promoter with a broader peak centered at the TSS with maximal density at \u22125 bp. This discrepancy likely comes from biases in the probability of sonication breaking the DNA at the nucleosome-depleted region of the promoter, as accessible regions such as DNase I sites and promoters of active genes have been shown to be sonicated at higher probability than inactive genomic regions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Teytelman et al., 2009</a>). Analysis of a published sonicated input chromatin sample indicates a strong sonication bias at the promoter region (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, by predominantly fragmenting the chromatin with MNase, it is possible to generate footprints corresponding to nucleosomes and other DNA-bound factors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Henikoff et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Skene et al., 2014</a>). Overall, this shows that using a high-resolution ChIP technique to map the protected footprint of PolII achieves comparable resolution to the single base-pair resolution achieved by mapping the position of the active site of PolII via nascent chain mapping. In comparison to conventional ChIP-seq, using high-resolution X-ChIP-seq achieves both higher resolution, as indicated by the width of the ChIP peak and higher accuracy by avoiding sonication bias, as shown by high similarity to 3\u2032NT. Moreover, the depth of sequencing indicates the cost-effectiveness of this high-resolution ChIP approach, with the 3\u2032NT profile based on 150 million reads (<a href=\"#bib18\">Weber et al., 2014</a>), whereas our method required only 7 million paired-end reads with a fragment length of 20\u201370 bp. For comparison, the PolII profile generated by conventional ChIP was based on 13 million mapped reads (<a href=\"#bib1\">Core et al., 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "A limitation of high-resolution X-ChIP-seq is that a minority of the immunoprecipitated fragments represent the footprint of PolII on DNA, likely as a consequence of formaldehyde readily forming protein\u2013protein crosslinks generating complexes such as PolII crosslinked to nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Koerber et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Skene et al., 2014</a>). In our previous study, mapping murine PolII, only 10% of the fragments were 20\u201370 bp in length and less than 3% were under 50 bp (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Skene et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, to improve the cost-effectiveness of this technique and make it more applicable to transcription factors, which typically have a &lt;50-bp footprint, we have further optimized the method to enrich for short fragments prior to sequencing. Previously, Agencourt AMpure beads have been used to select for short fragments prior to linker ligation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Orsi et al., 2015</a>). In agreement, initial attempts indicated that Agencourt AMpure beads could enrich for DNA fragments below 100 bp from a complex mixture, but were unable to selectively purify fragments of \u223c50 bp. However, by adjusting the volumetric ratio of beads to DNA, we could reproducibly control the selection within the 100\u2013200 bp range with a ratio of 1.1\u00d7, leaving fragments of \u223c170 bp in the unbound fraction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Given that the ligation of the Illumina adapters to the immunoprecipitated DNA adds \u223c125 bp, by using this ratio of AMpure beads, we could selectively enrich for ligated products containing short inserts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Using this approach on input DNA from a MNase ChIP experiment, where the vast majority of the DNA fragments are from mono-nucleosomes, we find a 25-fold enrichment of fragments below 50 bp (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Therefore, combining this modification to the existing library preparation protocol with the MNase X-ChIP approach yields cost-effective high-resolution data."

To avoid the complexities of peak-calling algorithms that might be biased for differing data types, we used an unbiased approach of centering the data on CTCF motifs that were found within DNase I sites and therefore most likely bound by CTCF. High-resolution X-ChIP-seq of CTCF yielded a more focused distribution of reads centered over the CTCF motif. To quantify this, we measured the width of the ChIP peak at its half-height for each individual CTCF site (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). A conventional ChIP approach using sonication gave a half-height width of 200 bp. In contrast, analysis of 20\u201350 bp fragments from MNase ChIP gave much higher resolution, with a half-height width of only 50 bp, suggesting that genome-wide MNase is chewing back to a minimal footprint of CTCF bound to the DNA.

In ChIP-exo, sequential ligation reactions allow the demarcation of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends and bioinformatic analysis is used to identify \u2018peak pairs\u2019 that flank the transcription factor binding site. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> shows profiles based on ENCODE X-ChIP-seq data as processed by the ENCODE uniform processing pipelines and downloaded as \u2018raw signal\u2019, our high-resolution X-ChIP-seq stacked read data, and raw ChIP-exo data around a representative CTCF motif. Due to the low amounts of noise, high-resolution X-ChIP-seq is amenable to a very simple thresholding algorithm to identify peaks (<a href=\"#bib6\">Kasinathan et al., 2014</a>), requiring only 13 million paired-end reads to obtain a crisp peak feature. This is in contrast to ChIP-exo, where more complex analysis is required, including dedicated software (<a href=\"#bib12\">Rhee and Pugh, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Starick et al., 2015</a>). Based on 82 million reads, the ChIP-exo raw data show significant signal at a distance from the CTCF motif. This might be a consequence of immunoprecipitating sonicated 200\u2013300 bp chromatin fragments containing more than one protein, which would block the subsequent exonuclease cleavage. However, by using MNase to fragment the chromatin, which has both endo- and exo-nuclease activity, high-resolution X-ChIP-seq should be able to discriminate between nearby proteins. An additional limitation of ChIP-exo is that the input chromatin is not subjected to the same exonuclease treatment and therefore subsequent analyses cannot be normalized to input. With high-resolution X-ChIP-seq, however, all the steps in chromatin fragmentation are prepared prior to immunoprecipitation, thereby allowing input normalization. Moreover, high-resolution X-ChIP-seq requires only minimal alteration to the existing conventional ChIP workflow and library preparation, whereas other techniques require more extensive changes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Starick et al., 2015</a>). To more directly compare to ChIP-exo, we plotted the end positions of each of our 20\u201350 bp paired-end reads (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We find two predominant sharp peaks on either side of the 19-bp CTCF motif that are separated by 19 bp, indicating that on average for each of our immunoprecipitated fragments, MNase has chewed back to one side of the minimal sequence motif. In contrast, the signal for ChIP-exo is relatively diffuse when centered around the CTCF motif, with an average distance of 52 bp between peak pairs for the peak-called sites (<a href=\"#bib12\">Rhee and Pugh, 2011</a>). DNase I footprinting is often used to generate maps of global transcription factor binding at nucleotide resolution, with the drawback that the technique is not targeted to a specific transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib4\">Hesselberth et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Neph et al., 2012</a>). By comparing the ends of the DNA fragments released by DNase I footprinting and that of high-resolution X-ChIP-seq, we find that both techniques identify protected fragments with ends separated by 19 bp at the 19 bp consensus CTCF motifs (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This therefore suggests that high-resolution X-ChIP-seq can achieve single nucleotide resolution, and by using immunoprecipitation, has the advantage that it can be used to interrogate individual transcription factors."

Libraries were prepared from the isolated DNA and following cluster generation, 25 rounds of paired-end sequencing was performed by the FHCRC Genomics Shared Resource on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (<a href=\"#bib3\">Henikoff et al., 2011</a>). Details of the library protocol have previously been published (<a href=\"#bib9\">Orsi et al., 2015</a>). After processing and base-calling by Illumina software, paired-end sequencing data were aligned to the hg19 or dmel_r5_51 genome build using Bowtie or Novoalign, respectively. Counts per base pair were normalized as previously described with the fraction of mapped reads spanning each base-pair position multiplied by the genome size (<a href=\"#bib6\">Kasinathan et al., 2014</a>). To analyze reads by length, we divided paired-end fragments into distinct size classes, as indicated in the figure legends. V-plot construction has been previously described (<a href=\"#bib3\">Henikoff et al., 2011</a>). Half-height width for each individual site was calculated as follows: the half height was calculated by dividing the maximum ChIP signal within \u00b11000 bp of each 19 bp CTCF motif by the background signal, which was defined as the median ChIP signal between \u22121000 to \u2212900 and +900 to +1000 bp relative to the motif. The half-height width for each motif was calculated by counting the number of contiguous base pairs that had ChIP signal greater than or equal to the half-height."

Here we show a comparison of the half-height widths for high-resolution X-ChIP-seq and conventional ChIP-seq. As discussed above, it is not possible to further separate conventional ChIP-seq by fragment sizes, as single end sequencing was used by the ENCODE project, which is appropriate as sonication yields 200-500 bp fragments, and because of the bias introduced by sonication the length of a fragment does not reflect its DNA footprint of protein binding."
