Using closed-loop stimulation, we triggered inhibition of dorsal CA1 at specific phases of the endogenous theta rhythm in freely behaving mice. This intervention enhanced performance on a spatial navigation task that requires the encoding and retrieval of information related to reward location on every trial. In agreement with prior models of hippocampal function, the behavioral effects depended on both the phase of theta and the task segment at which we stimulated. Stimulation in the encoding segment enhanced performance when inhibition was triggered by the peak of theta. Conversely, stimulation in the retrieval segment enhanced performance when inhibition was triggered by the trough of theta. These results suggest that processes related to the encoding and retrieval of task-relevant information are preferentially active at distinct phases of theta."

This finding was consistent with previous studies from rats, which showed that anatomical changes occur in the hippocampus after animals learn to navigate through various mazes.

However, it also contains cells that suppress the activity of the pyramidal neurons, using an inhibitory molecule called GABA. When electrodes are used to record the combined electrical activity of many cells in the hippocampus\u2014including both excitatory and inhibitory cells\u2014the resulting pattern resembles a wave with peaks and troughs that repeat roughly eight times per second.

This meant that it was possible to reduce the overall level of activity in the hippocampus by shining light on certain neurons."

Theta is a distributed oscillation, which is broadly coherent between the left and right hippocampi, the entorhinal cortex, the medial septum, and various other cortical and subcortical recipients of hippocampal projections (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 2002</a>). Neural activity is highly structured within each cycle of theta, with the firing rates of genetically defined cell types peaking at different phases (<a href=\"#bib24\">Klausberger et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2005</a>).

Input from the entorhinal cortex (EC), the major source of cortical projections to the hippocampus, is highest at the trough of theta waves recorded at the hippocampal fissure (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brankack et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kamondi et al., 1998</a>). Because it conveys information about the outside world, this input is likely associated with encoding of the current state of the environment (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hasselmo, 2005</a>). At this same phase, the hippocampus is more susceptible to long-term potentiation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hyman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kwag and Paulsen, 2009</a>), consistent with the idea that this phase is optimized for encoding new information. At the 180\u00b0 phase offset (the peak of fissure theta), CA1 cells receive greater input from upstream cells in CA3 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hasselmo, 2005</a>). At this phase, stimulation of Schaffer collateral or temporoammonic inputs induces long-term depression (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hyman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kwag and Paulsen, 2009</a>), which could suppress information storage during memory retrieval. As a result of these phase-specific physiological changes, hippocampal networks can regulate the behavioral impact of different types of information as a function of task context."

Furthermore, these oscillations occur at different phases of theta, and typically on different cycles (<a href=\"#bib9\">Colgin et al., 2009</a>). Taken together, these results indicate that the balance between the relative influence of the outside world (via EC) and internal states (via CA3) on hippocampal outputs is strongly modulated as a function of theta phase. Other studies have observed task-dependent modulation of hippocampal firing that is consistent with encoding of novel stimuli and retrieval of stored memories being biased to different phases (<a href=\"#bib30\">Manns et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lever et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Douchamps et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Newman et al., 2013</a>).

We directly activated parvalbumin-positive interneurons, which deliver fast and powerful inhibition to the cell bodies of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bartos et al., 2007</a>), at either the falling phase or rising phase of theta recorded in the local field potential (LFP).

Our stimulation occurred relative to the phase of locally recorded theta on the trigger electrodes, rather than the phase at the hippocampal fissure, to which much of the previous literature uses as a landmark (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brankack et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kamondi et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hasselmo et al., 2002</a>).

In 3/4 mice, we measured stimulation times relative to the peak of high gamma for both the trigger electrode and a neighboring electrode that was passively recording signals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Although post-mortem analysis of electrolytic lesions revealed different locations for each electrode, all electrodes indicated that peak-triggered stimulation occurred just after the trough of high gamma, whereas trough-triggered stimulation occurred around or after the high gamma peak. In one mouse, we could not measure absolute stimulation phase, due to the trigger electrode's location in L5/6 of cortex overlying hippocampus. This electrode expressed high theta power, presumably volume-conducted from hippocampus, which was used to trigger stimulation. However, it lacked associated high gamma power, which occurs more locally."

(2002)</a>, illustrates the mechanism by which this could occur. On average, the influence of CA3 and entorhinal cortex inputs to CA1 changes as a function of theta phase (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hasselmo et al., 2002</a>). Under baseline conditions, the relative influence of CA3 and EC is \u2018balanced\u2019. With the addition of closed-loop optogenetic feedback, excess inhibition reduces spike activity either during EC-dominant or CA3-dominant periods of the theta cycle. Although the parvalbumin-positive interneurons recruited by this manipulation are typically active during the CA3-dominant phases of theta (<a href=\"#bib28\">Laszt\u00f3czi and Klausberger, 2014</a>), causal control allows us to activate them synchronously at arbitrary times during the theta cycle. Under the proposed mechanism, inhibiting CA1 during EC-dominant cycles in the retrieval segment improves task performance by increasing the relative influence of CA3. Conversely, inhibiting CA1 during CA3-dominant cycles in the encoding segment improves task performance by increasing the relative influence of EC or by suppressing retrieval of interfering cross-trial information.

At the top, a sine wave indicates the phase of theta. Below, the purple and green histograms show the fluctuating influence of CA3 and EC on CA1 on each cycle. Levels represent averages; on individual cycles, one or the other may dominate (<a href=\"#bib9\">Colgin et al., 2009</a>). When optogenetic inhibition is triggered on the trough of theta (T), it tends to reduce firing rates in CA1 during periods of high EC influence. This tips the balance in favor of CA3, thereby improving performance during periods of retrieval (R). When optogenetic inhibition is triggered on the peak of theta (P), it tends to reduce firing rates in CA1 during period of high CA3 influence. This tips the balance in favor of EC, thereby improving performance during periods of encoding (E). On the whole, our closed-loop manipulation may improve performance by reducing the influence task-irrelevant inputs as a function of both theta phase and maze region."

This suggests a simple, CA1-specific mechanism could be sufficient to explain our behavioral results. According to our proposed mechanism, suppression of inputs carrying information about the current state of the world improves performance in the retrieval segment, whereas suppression of inputs carrying information about past states improves performance in the encoding segment."

The navigation task used in this study must engage a wide network of brain regions, including those that receive monosynaptic projections from CA1. Besides projections back to the entorhinal cortex, the major cortical output of dorsal CA1 is retrosplenial cortex (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007</a>). Retrosplenial cortex is known to be important for spatial working memory (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vann and Aggleton, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Keene and Bucci, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vann et al., 2009</a>), and changes in coupling between hippocampus and this region could affect performance on the present task. There is also a projection from CA1 to prefrontal cortex, although this originates primarily from the ventral regions (<a href=\"#bib50\">Swanson, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007</a>). It is possible that our optogenetic manipulation is affecting prefrontal-dependent decision-making via ventral CA1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Colgin, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schmidt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">O'Neill et al., 2013</a>), subicular projections (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jay and Witter, 1991</a>), or multisynaptic pathways. Our manipulation could also be exerting long-range effects through the actions of projecting interneurons, a small fraction of which are parvalbumin-positive (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jinno, 2009</a>)."

However, if a change in inter-regional coupling strength is at play, we might expect the impact of our optogenetic manipulation to be most pronounced during the retrieval segment, when cortical regions involved in behavioral guidance are likely to access the hippocampal representation of space. In this case, it is not clear that phase-specific stimulation of the hippocampus in the encoding segment should also affect performance. Although our observation of a double-dissociation suggests that the main mechanism is local to the hippocampus, disruption of CA1\u2013mPFC coupling during the encoding segment could minimize cross-trial interference, also leading to enhanced performance."

It is possible that inhibiting the hippocampus biases the mouse toward an egocentric strategy, which happens to improve performance. If this were the case, again, we would not expect to see such a striking double-dissociation effect in our results. We would instead predict that the same phase of stimulation would enhance performance in both the encoding and retrieval segments. Further evidence against a \u2018strategy switching\u2019 mechanism could come from an experiment in which inhibition was activated at the optimal phase for <i>both</i> the encoding and retrieval segments on individual trials. If stimulation is merely invoking a change in strategy, we would not expect to see additive effects; that is, stimulation in the encoding phase would be sufficient to reach peak performance. However, if combined encoding and retrieval stimulation improved performance more than one or the other in isolation, it would suggest that specific effects on encoding and retrieval operations are at play."

They are not necessarily confined to the \u2018encoding\u2019 and \u2018retrieval\u2019 segments specific to this task. The mice are actually performing at least two tasks concurrently, one which involves entry into the cued reward arm (the trained task) and one which involves acting based on the outcome of the previous trial (an untrained task). Could optogenetic stimulation merely serve to \u2018reset\u2019 the system, reducing interference between trials? We consider this possibility unlikely, due to the fact that the effects of stimulation at different phases depended on the track segment in which it occurred. This double-dissociation indicates that stimulation at the appropriate phase allowed mice to more accurately update and retrieve knowledge of the upcoming reward location, rather than simply suppress the influence of the previous trial. In addition, optogenetic stimulation did not impair performance for \u2018easy\u2019 trials, in which the cued reward location was consistent with animals' tendency toward a \u2018win\u2013stay, lose\u2013switch\u2019 strategy (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). If stimulation brought mice back to a na\u00efve \u2018baseline\u2019 state, we would expect them to make more errors when inhibition is recruited on these trials.

Our initial hypothesis was that the effects of stimulation would depend on both the task segment and phase, but we were unsure if they would be beneficial or punitive. Given that we are recruiting inhibition, and thereby suppressing CA1 output, one might expect the behavioral impact on a hippocampal-dependent task to be negative. Recruiting inhibition during the \u2018retrieval\u2019 phase should impair performance in the retrieval segment, whereas recruiting inhibition during the \u2018encoding\u2019 phase should impair performance during the encoding segment. The fact that we instead observed only enhanced performance (rather than enhancement for one phase of stimulation and impairment for the other) may be explained by a floor effect. Baseline performance was modest at the start of testing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), which makes it unlikely that we could observe a significant impairment, even if it did exist. Mice were strongly influenced by the outcome of the previous trial (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), which explains why their accuracy on the trained task is only slightly (but significantly) above chance. Our phase-specific optogenetic intervention helps them overcome this bias, especially in the case of trials in which they are required to switch arms after receiving reward (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). However, even for trials in which the reward location was consistent with animals' intrinsic biases, stimulation did not interfere with performance. It is possible that higher light intensities, alternate fiber placements, or a different target phase could have created the conditions necessary to negatively impact behavior."

We advance this line of investigation through the use of a closed-loop optogenetic intervention that allowed us to interact with the hippocampus at specific phases of theta on a trial-by-trial basis. As the tools for closed-loop control become more accessible, experiments that couple precise stimulation to internal state variables have the potential to enhance our understanding of a wide range of topics related to the study of neural systems."

Expression spread \u223c2 mm along the length of the dorsal hippocampus, primarily in CA1, but also in the lateral portion of CA3. Labeling was strongest in the hippocampal cell layer, where parvalbumin-positive cells have the densest projections. There was also expression in overlying cortex. No expression was observed in the dentate gyrus. In all animals, the lesion corresponding to the electrode used to trigger stimulation was identified."

The activation of PV neurons causes highly temporally specific spiking in the PV cells and a period of about 25 msec of inhibition of spiking in pyramidal cells. The behavior was tested in an end to end T maze where rats had to match the start location A vs. B (described as the encoding segment) with a response to A or B arm after running along a shared stem (described as the retrieval segment). Effects of different stimulation on the peak or trough of theta were evaluated when a rat was in the encoding or retrieval portion of the task. Behavioral performance was enhanced when peak-triggered stimulation was delivered in the encoding segment (falling on the falling slope of theta and presumably reducing CA3 influence during encoding, thereby reducing interference from retrieval during encoding). Behavioral performance was also improved when stimulation was trough triggered in the retrieval segment (falling on the rising slope of theta and presumably reducing EC influence, thereby reducing distraction from external input during retrieval). This double dissociation is very striking and theoretically significant and highly deserving of publication in a high impact journal. The experiment is very technically sophisticated and has addressed important questions of behavioral controls (determining whether behavior changed during stimulation) and questions about neurophysiological changes during stimulation (primarily there was a strong reduction in pyramidal cell spiking activity during the optogenetic activity). The specificity of their effect on behavior depends not on the degree of activity in CA1, but the content of the activity, as they note in the Discussion."

First, there is a bit of a disconnect between the author's review of the literature, which emphasizes differences between the peak and the trough of theta oscillations as recorded in the hippocampal fissure, and the author's stimulation protocol, which targeted stimulation at either the falling or rising phase of theta at sites other than the hippocampal fissure. The authors should more explicitly link their protocol to the literature and provide the rationale for why their stimulation protocol differed from what they led the reader to expect. Second, the anatomical position of the electrode that the authors used to record theta differed across the four mice (one each in: stratum radiatum at the CA1/CA3 border, stratum pyramidale in CA1, unspecified layer of dentate gyrus, and unspecified area and layer of cortex above CA1). As a result, the phase of theta at which the authors delivered light stimulation would differ across mice. For example, the \u201cpeak\u201d of theta would be similar between the cortex above CA1 and CA1 pyramidal layer, but these peaks would not align with the peaks of theta from the electrode in stratum radiatum. None of these peaks would align with the peaks of theta recorded in dentate gyrus. The authors discuss this issue to some extent in the discussion, but they give the impression that only one mouse would differ from the other three. Instead, across the four mice, the authors effectively used three different definitions of theta phase. Indeed, given this variability, the relative consistency of the effects of stimulation on behavior are puzzling.

After substantial training, they perform barely above 60% correct, hardly compelling evidence that mice really learn this task. On the other hand, this is a good baseline for improvement by stimulation, as observed. Also, the authors should consider that the poor performance is likely because of the high degree of interference between the many repeated left- and right-turn trials, consistent with the favored interpretation that stimulation at the right time may reduce interference of competing memories, which could be viewed as the principal variable in controlling performance."

Because absolute theta phase was not captured by our previous descriptions and analysis, we think readers will find the current presentation much more informative. In addition, the similarity of stimulation times relative to the high gamma peak (except in one animal, in which we were unable to measure this variable) supports the hypothesis that our consistent behavioral results are due to the precision of our phase-specific intervention."

As far as we can tell, this does not imply that stimulation induces a change in the resonant properties of the local circuit.

Based on the shape of the evoked response to each optogenetic stimulus, it appears that these effects are due to the frequency content of the average waveform, rather than non-phase-aligned induced power in different frequency bands (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). Aligning the local field potential to the start of each light pulse revealed a large deflection, 200-400 \u00b5V in amplitude.
