In this study, we report that while they have lost DNA repair activity, Cry1/2 adapted to protect genomic integrity by responding to DNA damage through posttranslational modification and coordinating the downstream transcriptional response. We demonstrate that genotoxic stress stimulates Cry1 phosphorylation and its deubiquitination by Herpes virus associated ubiquitin-specific protease (Hausp, a.k.a Usp7), stabilizing Cry1 and shifting circadian clock time. DNA damage also increases Cry2 interaction with Fbxl3, destabilizing Cry2. Thus, genotoxic stress increases the Cry1/Cry2 ratio, suggesting distinct functions for Cry1 and Cry2 following DNA damage. Indeed, the transcriptional response to genotoxic stress is enhanced in <i>Cry1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> and blunted in <i>Cry2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells. Furthermore, <i>Cry2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells accumulate damaged DNA. These results suggest that Cry1 and Cry2, which evolved from DNA repair enzymes, protect genomic integrity via coordinated transcriptional regulation."

In this study, we report that while they have lost DNA repair activity, Cry1/2 adapted to protect genomic integrity by responding to DNA damage through posttranslational modification and coordinating the downstream transcriptional response. We demonstrate that genotoxic stress stimulates Cry1 phosphorylation and its deubiquitination by Herpes virus associated ubiquitin-specific protease (Hausp, a.k.a Usp7), stabilizing Cry1 and shifting circadian clock time. DNA damage also increases Cry2 interaction with Fbxl3, destabilizing Cry2. Thus, genotoxic stress increases the Cry1/Cry2 ratio, suggesting distinct functions for Cry1 and Cry2 following DNA damage. Indeed, the transcriptional response to genotoxic stress is enhanced in <i>Cry1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> and blunted in <i>Cry2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells. Furthermore, <i>Cry2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells accumulate damaged DNA. These results suggest that Cry1 and Cry2, which evolved from DNA repair enzymes, protect genomic integrity via coordinated transcriptional regulation."

Papp, Huber et al. show that DNA damage triggers cryptochrome 1 to bind to a protein called Hausp, which stabilizes the cryptochrome and prevents it from being broken down. By contrast, DNA damage triggers cryptochrome 2 to bind to a protein called Fbxl3, which has a destabilizing effect on the cryptochrome and promotes its degradation. Since the cryptochromes regulate the activity of BMAL1 and CLOCK, the proteins associated with the two master clock genes, these changes can have a significant effect on the circadian clock of an organism."

Genetic disruption of both Cry1 and Cry2 also alters the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (<a href=\"#bib49\">Narasimamurthy et al., 2012</a>), the severity of arthritis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hashiramoto et al., 2010</a>), and salt-induced blood pressure elevation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Doi et al., 2010</a>). Genetic inactivation of Cry1 and/or Cry2 has also been reported to alter rates of tumor formation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ozturk et al., 2009</a>), though the reported effects have varied (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fu and Kettner, 2013</a>). In addition, Cry-deficient mice are resistant to genotoxic stress in the context of cyclophosphamide treatment (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gorbacheva et al., 2005</a>). Consistent with the idea that Cry1/2 may be promiscuous transcriptional repressors involved in a wide variety of physiological pathways, a recent study found that Cry1 and Cry2 each bound thousands of chromatin sites independently of other clock transcription factors in mouse liver (<a href=\"#bib35\">Koike et al., 2012</a>)."

Cry1 and Cry2 evolved from prokaryotic light-activated DNA repair enzymes, known as photolyases. While they seem to have lost the [6-4]photolyase catalytic activity characteristic of their ancestral homologs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ozturk et al., 2007</a>), they retain the ability to bind preferentially to UV-damaged DNA containing a [6-4]photoproduct (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ozgur and Sancar, 2003</a>). The three-dimensional structures of Cry1 and Cry2 resemble those of photolyases, including the DNA binding surfaces (<a href=\"#bib46\">Maul et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Czarna et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Xing et al., 2013</a>). Together, these properties suggest that Cry1 and Cry2 could retain a residual role in sensing or responding to damaged DNA. Such conservation of function by divergent molecular mechanisms has been seen previously between cryptochromes derived from different species (<a href=\"#bib75\">Yuan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lamia et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2014</a>)."

Herpes virus associated ubiquitin-specific protease (Hausp; a.k.a. Usp7) was first identified as the cellular partner of the herpes virus protein Vmw110 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Everett et al., 1997</a>). Hausp modulates proliferation by catalyzing the removal of polyubiquitin chains from the tumor suppressor p53 and from the p53-destabilizing E3 ligases Mdm2 and MdmX (<a href=\"#bib43\">Li et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2004</a>). The affinity of Hausp for p53 is increased and for Mdm2/MdmX is decreased in response to DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib32\">Khoronenkova et al., 2012</a>), contributing to stabilization of p53. Knockout of Hausp in mice is lethal (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kon et al., 2010</a>), probably due to disrupted cell proliferation. A growing list of Hausp substrates has been identified recently, including several components of DNA damage response and DNA repair pathways (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nicholson and Suresh Kumar, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Schwertman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jacq et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Eletr and Wilkinson, 2014</a>).

Nonetheless, if Hausp stabilizes Cry1 by removing ubiquitin chains, reducing Hausp expression or activity is expected to alter circadian rhythms. In immortalized fibroblasts expressing a Per2-Luciferase fusion from the endogenous Per2 locus (<i>Per2::Luc</i> [<a href=\"#bib74\">Yoo et al., 2004</a>]), shRNA-mediated depletion of Hausp increased circadian period (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). We also observed period lengthening in immortalized <i>Per2::Luc</i> MEFs when Hausp activity was inhibited pharmacologically (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). Because our data suggest that Hausp inhibition and AMPK activation each destabilizes nuclear Cry1, we examined whether they could synergistically increase circadian period. Using cells stably expressing luciferase under a circadian promoter (<i>U2OS-B6</i> [<a href=\"#bib70\">Vollmers et al., 2008</a>]), we observed that activation of AMPK increased the circadian period as expected (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lamia et al., 2009</a>), inhibition of Hausp also increased period, and combined activation of AMPK and inhibition of Hausp led to a dramatic increase in period, perhaps reflecting synergistic destabilization of nuclear Cry1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>)."

Because Hausp catalyzes the removal of polyubiquitin chains from Cry1 thereby decreasing its proteasomal degradation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), increased Cry1\u2013Hausp association in response to genotoxic stress leads to a prediction that DNA damage should increase Cry1 protein levels. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that exposure to DNA damage transiently stabilized endogenous Cry1 in primary MEFs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). Intriguingly, Cry2 was destabilized following exposure to DNA damage, demonstrating that the increase in Cry1 does not merely reflect a change or synchronization of the circadian rhythm and suggesting differential regulation of these highly homologous family members, consistent with our observation that Hausp preferentially interacts with Cry1. Because Cry1 and Cry2 each can repress the other's expression, Cry2 protein could decrease in response to damage secondary to stabilization of Cry1. However, Cry2 protein decreases and Cry1 protein increases in response to DNA damage in MEFs expressing only a single Cry paralog (i.e., Cry2 in <i>Cry1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> MEFs and vice versa; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

Note that the weaker interactions that we observed between Hausp and Cry2 or hybrid constructs containing the C-terminus of Cry2 compared to those containing the Cry1 C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) are likely artefacts of overexpression in 293T cells since we did not observe destabilization of Cry2 upon Hausp depletion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

This hypothesis is supported by the non-random distribution of cell division within circadian cycles (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nagoshi et al., 2004</a>). Theoretically, in order for clocks to enable such a separation, their timing must be responsive to genotoxic stress, analogous to entrainment by metabolic signals, which enables clocks to optimally coordinate cellular metabolism with externally fluctuating metabolic demands (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ramsey and Bass, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jordan and Lamia, 2013</a>).

It appears that DNA damage initiates a complex cascade of signal transduction that alters circadian clock dynamics in a complicated manner. The large number of phosphorylation events in Cry1, Cry2, and Hausp induced by genotoxic stress supports an important role for these proteins in sensing or responding to such stress.

In the first part of the manuscript, the authors detail their discovery of a DNA damage-regulated interaction of Cry1 with the deubiquitinase, Hausp. They show that this interaction is specific for Cry1, mediated by its unique C-terminus, and that DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of SQ/TQ sites in the Cry1 C-terminus play a role in assembling the complex. Stabilization of Cry1 after deubiquitination by Hausp occurs only in the nucleus. Importantly, they demonstrate a reciprocal relationship between the damage-induced interaction with Hausp (stabilizing) and interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Fbxl3 (destabilizing). In the absence of stabilizing Hausp-interactions with Cry2, the authors show that Cry2 undergoes a net destabilization after DNA damage. The authors present data that Hausp is required for DNA damage-dependent phase shifting of the clock, presumably through regulation of Cry1 protein levels. These data are consistent with findings from Oklejewicz et al. that DNA damage induces circadian phase advances through a transcription-independent mechanism. Together, these data provide one of the first molecular descriptions of how DNA damage impacts the stability of circadian proteins."

Here, the data for Cry1/2 regulation is less convincingly direct. Some genes, like p21, show striking Cry1 or Cry2-dependent changes from WT of opposite magnitude, while others show only a Cry1-dependent change in magnitude or kinetics of induction (Mdm2, <i>Puma</i>). It is unclear whether statistical significance should be determined by comparing damage-dependent transcription to the zero point (i.e. without damage) or between genotypes, if we are to assess the role of Cry1/2 in the responses. Moreover, it is not clear from the data presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> how direct the role of Cry1 or Cry2 is in transcriptional regulation of these genes. The authors are admittedly careful not to attribute changes in mRNA to direct regulation by Cry1/2, although it feels as though they imply this direct regulation by citing the Koike et al. findings that Cry1/2 are recruited to sites throughout chromatin. It is unclear what 'Cry1/2-coordinated responses' means in this context and should be better clarified."

Indeed, the mechanism by which Cry1/2 expression or stability is altered influences the ultimate effects on circadian period length. There are several examples in which a change in the average level of Cry1 or Cry2 protein expression can either increase or decrease circadian period depending on the details, some of which are cited by the reviewers. For example, KL001 increases period even in <i>Cry1</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hirota, Science, 2012</a>) showing that stabilization of Cry2 leads to long period length even though knockout or knockdown of Cry2 also increases circadian period. Mathematical modeling spurred the authors of that study to hypothesize that Cry1 and Cry2 have similar roles in period determination and that nuclear stabilization of either isoform leads to period lengthening. We find that destabilization of nuclear Cry1 by shRNA-mediated knockdown of Hausp or pharmacological inhibition of Hausp increases period, which is consistent with the long period in cells treated with AMPK activators that also destabilize nuclear Cry1 but in contrast to short periods observed in <i>Cry1</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells and long periods in KL001-treated cells in which nuclear Cry1 is stabilized. This discrepancy could be attributed to temporal segregation of the actions of Fbxl3 and Hausp, perhaps one of them is more important during the phase of Cry1/2 accumulation and the other critical during the destruction phase. Alternatively, while the inhibition of Fbxl3 binding and ubiquitylation of Cry1 by KL001 and the acceleration of Cry1 ubiquitylation by Hausp knockdown or inhibition have opposing effects on nuclear Cry1 stability, their similar effects on circadian period length could reflect actions of different subsets of Cry1 (e.g. Cry1 with different posttranslational modifications or in different subnuclear locations) or differential effects on Cry2: for example, in <i>Cry1</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells and in KL001-treated cells, Cry2 is stabilized while in Hausp-depleted cells, Cry2 is unaffected. Updating mathematical models to incorporate new clock protein partners, posttranslational modifications and the effects on period upon interference with them may help to predict the relative importance of new pathways in various phases of circadian negative feedback (St. John, PNAS, 2014). We have updated the text to accommodate these uncertainties about the relationship between Cry1/2 stability and circadian period determination."

For example: if Cry2 has a slightly higher affinity than does Cry1 for transcription factor X, in quiescent wildtype cells, X is repressed by Cry2 and poised for activation upon Cry2 degradation following DNA damage. Accumulation of Cry1 after DNA damage would allow Cry1 to replace the degraded Cry2 and return expression of the target genes of X to basal levels resulting in transient activation in wildtype cells while expression of those genes would be sustained in <i>Cry1</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells as we observed. The activation of those genes would be blunted in <i>Cry2</i><sup>-/-</sup> cells due to Cry1 being bound to X in the absence of Cry2 since Cry1 would not be degraded in response to the damage stimulus (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).
