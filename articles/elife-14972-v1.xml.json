Can this altered belief about the body also affect physiological mechanisms involved in body-ownership, such as motor control? Here we ask whether the excitability of the motor pathways to the real (disembodied) hand are affected by the illusion. Our results show that the amplitude of the motor-evoked potentials recorded from the real hand is significantly reduced, with respect to baseline, when subjects in the synchronous (but not in the asynchronous) condition experience the fake hand as their own. This finding contributes to the theoretical understanding of the relationship between body-ownership and motor system, and provides the first physiological evidence that a significant drop in motor excitability in M1 hand circuits accompanies the disembodiment of the real hand during the RHI experience."

Can this altered belief about the body also affect physiological mechanisms involved in body-ownership, such as motor control? Here we ask whether the excitability of the motor pathways to the real (disembodied) hand are affected by the illusion. Our results show that the amplitude of the motor-evoked potentials recorded from the real hand is significantly reduced, with respect to baseline, when subjects in the synchronous (but not in the asynchronous) condition experience the fake hand as their own. This finding contributes to the theoretical understanding of the relationship between body-ownership and motor system, and provides the first physiological evidence that a significant drop in motor excitability in M1 hand circuits accompanies the disembodiment of the real hand during the RHI experience."

Even in healthy people, the \u2018rubber hand illusion\u2019 can temporarily produce a similar phenomenon. Individuals watch a lifelike rubber hand being touched while their own hand \u2013 which is hidden from view \u2013 is touched at the same time.

Apparently, in normal conditions, the feeling of body ownership does not need any particular explanation; it is immediate and even obvious. However, both pathological cases after brain damage (somatoparaphrenia [<a href=\"#bib30\">Romano et al., 2014</a>] and pathological embodiment [<a href=\"#bib27\">Pia et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fossataro et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Garbarini et al., 2013</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib13\">2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Pia et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Garbarini and Pia, 2013</a>]) and experimental manipulations in healthy subjects (e.g. the rubber hand illusion \u2013 RHI [<a href=\"#bib4\">Botvinick and Cohen, 1998</a>]) suggest that body ownership, as we normally experience it, is the product of many different and complex operations. It has been suggested that the feeling that our body belongs to us presumably depends on multisensory integration processes arising within a fronto-parietal network, where sensory inputs coming from different modalities are realigned in a unique reference frame (<a href=\"#bib2\">Blanke et al., 2015</a>). Within this network, the ventral premotor cortex seems to play a crucial role, thus establishing, both in monkeys (<a href=\"#bib18\">Graziano, 1999</a>) and in humans (<a href=\"#bib24\">Makin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Ehrsson et al., 2004</a>), an anatomical link between the sense of body ownership and the motor system. Furthermore, it has been proposed that voluntary motor activity of body parts contributes critically to the subjective experience of body ownership (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tsakiris et al., 2010</a>). Within this context, we asked whether the subjective and sometimes illusory sense of body ownership influences objective measures of the sensory-motor system. We took advantage of the RHI paradigm in order to provide a physiological counterpart of the interaction between body awareness and motor control, investigating the relationship between body ownership alterations, such\u00a0as those occurring during the RHI, and modulation of primary motor cortex excitability."

                        "text": "During the RHI, the subject\u2019s real hand is out of view, while a realistic rubber hand (RH) is positioned in its place. When the experimenter synchronously strokes the index finger of both the real and the fake hand, most subjects, after a few seconds of viewing the fake hand\u2019s finger being touched, attribute their tactile sensation to the RH hand, which they start to perceive as their own. During the illusion, the subject\u2019s hand-centered reference frame shifts towards the RH, and\u00a0so\u00a0it has been proposed that, as a consequence, the real hand is subject to a sort of disembodiment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ehrsson et al., 2004</a>). Accordingly, a feeling of disownership of one\u2019s own hand has been reported as an important behavioural component of the RHI (<a href=\"#bib22\">Longo et al., 2008</a>), while a decrease in the temperature of the real (disembodied) hand has been observed as a neurophysiological correlate of the RHI (<a href=\"#bib25\">Moseley et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that cooling the subject\u2019s hand increases the strength of the RHI, whereas warming the hand decreases it (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kammers et al., 2011</a>). However, another study found that hand-cooling can be present in both the\u00a0experimental (synchronous) and the\u00a0control (asynchronous) condition, thus suggesting that it is not a reliable correlate of the subjective feeling of hand disownership in the RHI (<a href=\"#bib29\">Rohde et al., 2013</a>). A further study proposed that somatosensory changes observed in the participants' hand while experiencing the RHI can be explained by cross-modal mismatch between the seen and felt position of the hand, and are not necessarily a signature of disownership (<a href=\"#bib9\">Folegatti et al., 2009</a>)."

Moreover, during the main physiological experiment, we studied the excitability modulation of motor circuits to the real (stimulated) hand during RHI. While subjects received visual-tactile stimulations, either synchronous (to induce the illusion) or asynchronous (control condition), motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were elicited by a single-pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left primary motor cortex (M1) and recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI).

Thus, a decrease of FDI MEP amplitude compared to the baseline, specific to the real (disembodied) hand, was expected in the synchronous condition (where the subjects experienced the RHI) and not in the asynchronous (control) condition. Furthermore, according to behavioral studies reporting an increased illusory experience over time (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lewis and Lloyd, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Valenzuela Moguillansky et al., 2013</a>), this inhibitory motor response was expected to increase during exposure to the illusion.

Recently, using a moving version of the RHI, it has been shown that voluntary (but not passive) movement of the real hand decreases the perceptual shift towards the rubber hand, suggesting that the subjective sense of agency strongly contributes to a coherent sense of body ownership\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib37\">Tsakiris et al., 2010</a>). On the other hand, patients with schizophrenia, who show a specific deficit in predicting the consequences of their voluntary actions (<a href=\"#bib39\">Voss et al., 2010</a>), as well as an altered sense of agency (<a href=\"#bib15\">Garbarini et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Daprati et al., 1997</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib23\">Maeda et al., 2012</a>), are more susceptible to the RHI (<a href=\"#bib26\">Peled et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Asai et al., 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib34\">Thakkar et al., 2011</a>). Other studies on clinical populations with movement disorders suggest that patients with focal hand dystonia (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fiorio et al., 2011</a>) or partial or complete paralysis because of spinal cord injury (<a href=\"#bib32\">Scandola et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib35\">Tidoni et al., 2014</a>) seem to have some impairment of body ownership, according to their susceptibility to the RHI paradigm. A recent study (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burin et al., 2015</a>), investigating the RHI in movement disorder after brain-damage, shows that hemiplegic patients display a weaker/more flexible sense of body ownership for the affected (paralyzed) hand (where the strength of the RHI is increased)\u00a0when compared to controls, but an enhanced/more rigid sense of body ownership for the healthy hand (where the strength of the RHI is decreased). In other words, the prolonged absence of movement makes the paralyzed limb more readily disowned, while the healthy limb seems to be more strongly owned. Furthermore, other studies (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kilteni et al., 2016</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib33\">Sch\u00fctz-Bosbach et al., 2006</a>) have investigated the modulation of corticospinal excitability during different experimental manipulations related to the sense of body ownership, though none with the specific hypothesis of linking a decrease in subjective ownership with a decrease in motor excitability. <a href=\"#bib20\">Kilteni and colleagues (2016)</a> found that healthy people can experience a pseudo-amputation illusion during a virtual reality procedure, suggesting that this experimental manipulation causes corticospinal excitability changes in muscles associated with the virtually amputated body-part. <a href=\"#bib33\">Sch\u00fctz-Bosbach and colleagues (2006)</a> studied how an action observation task can induce different changes in corticospinal excitability, depending on the level of ownership experienced with respect to the observed moving hand. Ownership was previously manipulated using the RHI procedure: after asynchronous stimulation, observing others\u2019 actions facilitated the motor system, whereas after synchronous stimulation, identical observed actions, now illusorily attributed to the subject's own body, evoked smaller MEPs. In light of our findings, the absence of facilitatory effect during observation following synchronous stimulation can be interpreted as resulting from the decreased corticospinal excitability induced by the illusion."

In the present study, we found that the excitability of motor pathways in response to stimulation of the real (disembodied) hand is significantly decreased (i.e., MEP amplitude was significantly reduced) when subjects experience the artificial hand as their own. This suggests that an experimental manipulation of the sense of body ownership is accompanied by a coherent modulation of the motor system. However, as the experimental design was not suited to investigate correlations (see details in Material and methods), the present data do not allow us to address the question of whether subjects who experience a larger subjective illusion also show a larger decrease in MEPs. The presence\u00a0or\u00a0absence of linear correlations between MEP amplitude and behavioral measures, including both embodiment of the rubber hand and disembodiment of the real hand, will be investigated in future studies, in which physiological parameters of responder and non-responder subjects can be also compared."

Asynchronous stroking of a participant own hand and the\u00a0rubber hand was utilized as a control condition, in which strokes were delivered spatially and temporally out of phase between the two hands. Participants sat with their forearms resting on a table, with their right hand inserted, palm down, in one of two identical compartments of a wooden box (59\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a033\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a015\u00a0cm); the rubber hand was placed in the left compartment, in egocentric position and aligned with the participant\u2019s shoulder. The upper lid of the box could be lifted or lowered to either reveal or occlude the participant\u2019s view of the rubber hand in the left compartment, while his/her right hand was always out of view. The participant was able to see only the rubber hand being stroked by the experimenter\u2019s right hand, while the\u00a0subject's right hand and the experimenter\u2019s left hand were always out of subject's view. The distance between the index finger of the rubber hand and the participant\u2019s own right index finger was 20 cm. A cloth was placed so as to hide both the participant\u2019s shoulder and the proximal end of the rubber hand. The behavioral RHI effect was measured in two ways: (1) by asking participants to localize the position of their unseen hand along the horizontal plan in front of them, and thus obtaining a measure of the proprioceptive drift towards the rubber hand, (2) with a questionnaire investigating their feeling of ownership of the rubber hand as a consequence of the experimental manipulation. Moreover, in the control experiment, we also measured the disembodiment experience of the stimulated hand with a questionnaire investigating the feeling of loss of own hand (<a href=\"#bib22\">Longo et al., 2008</a>). The physiological effect was measured by recording motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), utilized to evaluate the excitability modulation of cortical and spinal motor neurons during the RHI. In the main experiment, MEPs were recorded from the real stimulated (right) hand, while in the control experiment, MEPs were recorded from the contralateral non-stimulated (left) hand."

In the main experiment, MEPs were elicited by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the hand area in the left M1 and recorded by self-adhesive bipolar surface electrodes that were placed over the belly of the right first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). Electromyographic (EMG) signals were amplified, filtered (10\u2009Hz to 1 kHz), digitally converted (sampling rate 5 kHz) and stored in a computer for offline analysis. The head of each subject was restrained by a comfortable pillow wrapping around the neck and supported by a fixed head rest. A mechanical arm held a figure-of-eight-shaped coil connected to a magnetic stimulator (Magstim 200; Magstim Co. Ltd, Whitland, UK; maximal power 2.2\u2009T). The coil was positioned and fixed on the left primary motor cortex with the handle pointing backwards at 45% from the midline so as to activate the selected muscle, and the stimulator output was set at about 110% of each subject\u2019s motor threshold (defined as the intensity giving three MEP responses out of six stimuli) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rossini et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Borroni et al., 2008</a>).

Normal distribution of the residuals was checked using the\u00a0Shapiro-Wilk test (p&gt;0.05), and the appropriate non-parametric tests were applied when one or more of the corresponding data sets failed to meet the criteria for normal distribution. In both experiments, for each subject, we\u00a0used MEPs recorded in each experimental condition (baseline, asynchronous and synchronous trials, a total of 60 trials), to\u00a0obtain\u00a0a grand-mean and a grand-standard-deviation. Then, each single trial was transformed in z-scores, according to the following formula: (<i>x \u2013 grand-mean)/(grand-standard-deviation)</i>, where <i>x</i> indicates a single trial value. The obtained values were averaged for each subject and entered into two separate (for the\u00a0main and control experiments) three-level (baseline, asynchronous, synchronous) one-way ANOVAs. In this analysis, for the main experiment, the distribution of residuals in the synchronous condition was not normal (respectively: p=0.70962, p=0.08347, p=0.00604). Thus, we performed Friedman non-parametric ANOVA in order to detect significant differences across the three conditions (baseline, asynchronous, synchronous); therefore, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for pairwise comparisons. Finally, for each pairwise comparison (N\u00a0=\u00a03), a Bonferroni correction was applied (a value/n of comparisons: 0.05/3\u00a0=\u00a00.017). In the control experiment, residuals of the three conditions were normally distributed (respectively: p=0.60988, p=0.44773, p=0.66546) and the ANOVA normality assumption was satisfied. Furthermore, we investigated the time course of MEP change in the synchronous condition of both experiments\u00a0in order to describe, for each subject, a MEP amplitude time-profile during the illusion. MEP z-scores for all participants were divided into four blocks of five MEPs each. The obtained values were averaged starting from 0 to 5 (TIME 1), from 6 to 10\u00a0(TIME 2), from 11 to 15\u00a0(TIME 3) and from 16 to 20\u00a0(TIME 4), and entered in a four-level one way ANOVA (TIME: one, two, three, four). Residuals for the main experiment were not normally distributed, so Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for within comparisons of the four-level time variable; for each pairwise comparison (N\u00a0=\u00a04), Bonferroni correction was applied (a value / n of comparisons: 0.05/4\u00a0=\u00a00.0125). Finally, in order to compare MEP modulation in the two experiments, we avoided classical ANOVA because residuals in the main experiment were not normally distributed. So, we calculated a delta on raw MEP amplitude between synchronous minus asynchronous for all subjects in each experiment; then the obtained values were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U-test.

Indeed, we could not obtain the behavioural responses during the registration of each MEP recording (due to time constraints during MEP acquisition) and, therefore, we could not have a point-by-point matching between those data. Furthermore, only responder subjects were admitted to the physiological experiment, i.e. we use only subjects who gave ratings higher than zero in the synchronous condition in the embodiment questionnaire administered during the behavioural experiment. Thus, in the present sample, which\u00a0only includes responder subjects, correlations between physiological parameters and the presence/absence of the illusion cannot be investigated. However, to investigate whether responder subjects who experience a larger subjective illusion also show a larger decrease in MEP amplitude, we computed correlations, using either ratings of the questionnaire or proprioceptive drift values. In both cases, we used two different approaches: a) we normalized MEP values, ratings and drift values by\u00a0using z-scores to compute independent correlations for synchronous and asynchronous conditions: significant correlations with MEPs were not found, neither for questionnaire ratings nor for proprioceptive drift; b) for MEP values, ratings and drift values, we computed a delta (synchronous minus asynchronous) value\u00a0and performed correlations on these\u00a0values: again,\u00a0no\u00a0significant correlations with MEPs were found\u00a0for questionnaire ratings or for proprioceptive drift."

They report that the illusion results in decreased corticospinal excitability as measured with motor-evoked potentials. The approach demonstrates a new neural correlate of the illusion that provides insight into its effects on the motor system. Specifically, the findings show that the disembodiment of one's own hand is reflected in the motor system (whereas earlier behavioral work has focused on aspects of embodiment rather than disembodiment). As such, the results suggest that we \"lose control\" of our own hands if we don't feel that they are fully \"ours\"."

Nevertheless, they raised substantive concerns that would require a new experiment to address. <i>eLife</i> typically tries to avoid requesting new experimental data (and in such cases, the usual outcome is a rejection). However, during post-review discussion, the consensus was that as the paper was sufficiently promising and that the new experiment was likely (though not guaranteed) to work and yield a manuscript that would be publishable in <i>eLife</i>. Thus we encourage you to collect the recommended data and resubmit the manuscript, in which case we will solicit input from the same reviewers.

However, this doesn't tell us any more than a simple comparison of MEPs between synch and asynch (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). If you take a continuous measure of illusion strength for each subject (difference in continuous Q ratings for synch \u2013 asynch or difference in proprioceptive drift for synch \u2013 asynch) and do a scatterplot against difference in MEPs for each subject, is there a correlation? This would address the question of whether subjects who show a larger effect of the illusion also show a larger decrease in MEPs. This analysis should examine continuous variables, difference scores between synch and asynch, and try it with all the dependent behavioral variables (questionnaire scores and proprioceptive drift)."

It was important to do this between the second and third series of recordings, when subjects had undergone either the asynchronous or, especially, the synchronous stimulation, which could have long-term effects on MEP amplitude (although having the subject take a 5 min resting pause resulted sufficient to prevent this possibility). MEP amplitude is intrinsically rather variable and a precise measure would have indeed required recording a full 20-MEP series and comparing averages and variability; we decided that inserting an additional 20-MEP series would have excessively prolonged the overall experiment at the expenses of data collection in the experimental conditions of interest. Having worked with TMS on M1 for over a decade, we confided in our solid experience in evaluating the quality of the recorded signal."

MEPs smaller than 50\u00b5V are not considered true motor responses, either because they can be lost in noisy recordings or because at both extremes (very small or very large) MEP amplitude loses it linear relation with stimulus intensity."

In the previous study we used as dependent variable of the MEP analysis only the synchronous and the asynchronous conditions and we plotted the baseline value as a graphical indication on the modulation direction (inhibition) in the synchronous condition. In that sample, we acquired 5 baseline trials at the beginning of the experiment and we used the mean value to plot the baseline in the graph. However, in the last 8 subjects we also acquired a true baseline condition with 20 trials (as in the synchronous and asynchronous conditions). We did this because, while running the experiment, we realized that a statistical comparison with the baseline could be useful. Then, when we decided that we needed to increase the sample size, we always included a baseline condition with 20 trials (as in the last 8 subjects of our previous study). Thus, in the present sample we included those 8 subjects from the previous data set and 16 new subjects: all performed the same experiment, including the baseline condition with 20 trials. Note that, 18 new subject were recruited for the behavioural experiment (thus, adding the previous 8 subjects, we had a sample of 26 subjects) but 2 out of 18 subjects were not admitted to the physiological experiment because they did not experience the illusion in the synchronous condition (see the above mentioned inclusion criterion to be admitted to the physiological experiment)."
