The probability of resistance should be controlled by the rate of generation of resistance mutations. If many adaptive mutations arise simultaneously, then adaptation proceeds by soft selective sweeps in which multiple adaptive mutations spread concomitantly, but if adaptive mutations occur rarely in the population, then a single adaptive mutation should spread alone in a hard selective sweep. Here, we use 6717 HIV-1 consensus sequences from patients treated with first-line therapies between 1989 and 2013 to confirm that the transition from fast to slow evolution of drug resistance was indeed accompanied with the expected transition from soft to hard selective sweeps. This suggests more generally that evolution proceeds via hard sweeps if resistance is unlikely and via soft sweeps if it is likely."

The probability of resistance should be controlled by the rate of generation of resistance mutations. If many adaptive mutations arise simultaneously, then adaptation proceeds by soft selective sweeps in which multiple adaptive mutations spread concomitantly, but if adaptive mutations occur rarely in the population, then a single adaptive mutation should spread alone in a hard selective sweep. Here, we use 6717 HIV-1 consensus sequences from patients treated with first-line therapies between 1989 and 2013 to confirm that the transition from fast to slow evolution of drug resistance was indeed accompanied with the expected transition from soft to hard selective sweeps. This suggests more generally that evolution proceeds via hard sweeps if resistance is unlikely and via soft sweeps if it is likely."

This may be because there are fewer virus particles in these patients, or because the specific combinations of mutations that provide resistance occur less often. Feder et al.\u2019s findings are a step towards understanding why modern HIV treatments work so well, which will ultimately help us find better treatments for other infectious diseases."

Nowadays, HIV treatments are more clinically effective and the evolution of drug resistance has become much slower and often does not occur for years if at all. The rate at which evolution occurs has been the subject of considerable recent interest in the evolutionary biology community. Although traditionally evolution was thought to be slow (<a href=\"#bib6\">Darwin, 1859</a>), there are a growing number of examples of fast evolution to selective pressures such as pesticides (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lopes et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Daborn et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Karasov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Palumbi, 2001</a>), industrialization (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cook et al., 2012</a>), or antibiotics (<a href=\"#bib19\">Laehnemann et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Nair et al., 2007</a>).

In a large population with a high mutation rate, mutations may be available as standing genetic variation (pre-existing variation) or be generated anew every generation, allowing the population to adapt to its environment rapidly. If adaptive mutations are rare, because the population is small, the mutation rate is low, or only few specific mutations (or combinations of mutations) can help a population adapt, the population will likely adapt to its environment much more slowly."

This results in a hard selective sweep, in which the single adaptive mutation and the nearby linked mutations becomes fixed in the population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

Since resistance only occurs on a single genetic background (background mutations in grey), all sequences with resistance will be similar (<b>B</b>) and diversity following this type of selective sweep will be reduced (<b>C</b>). We can use the reduction of diversity to determine that a selective sweep is hard. In patients treated with less effective treatments (bottom), we predict HIV populations should have a higher probability of acquiring resistance per generation, so resistance will be acquired more quickly and selective sweeps of drug resistance mutations will be soft (<b>D</b>). We can detect these soft selective sweeps, because diversity remains high when resistance mutations on different genetic backgrounds rise in frequency simultaneously (<b>E,F</b>)."

Although clinically effective drugs have decreased the rate of emergence of drug resistance, it is not clear what effect that they have had on the evolutionary dynamics of within-patient HIV populations. Specifically, population genetic theory predicts that populations should evolve primarily by soft sweeps when resistance is likely and by hard sweeps when resistance is rare. In essence, soft sweeps should mark cases of resistance that arise deterministically through many origins while hard sweeps mark cases of rare, 'unlucky' resistance."

Genetic diversity may result in ambiguous calls (also referred to as mixtures) in the reported sequence, so that a signal of within-patient genetic diversity is retained even though this sequencing approach generates only a single sequence per patient. We use the ambiguous calls to quantify within-patient genetic diversity (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B, E</a>, grey box), following several other studies (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kouyos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Poon et al., 2007</a>).

We find that, across all sequences, the presence of drug resistance mutations is associated with lower within-patient genetic diversity, marking the occurrence of selective sweeps. Second, we find that the extent of diversity reduction associated with drug resistance mutations varies with the clinical effectiveness of the treatment - effective drug treatments with low rates of virologic failure (such as NNRTI-based and boosted PI-based regimens) show strong reductions in diversity associated with each additional resistance mutation, a pattern more consistent with hard selective sweeps, whereas treatments that fail more often (such as regimens based only on NRTIs) show no reduction in diversity, a pattern consistent with soft selective sweeps. Although our results do not explain mechanistically how effective treatments lead to harder sweeps of drug resistance mutations, they suggest a more general principle: a lower rate of the production of adaptive mutations should be accompanied by harder sweeps."

Although the effectiveness value for these treatments is high by our metric, it has been observed that very high compliance rates are necessary for virologic suppression through unboosted PIs relative to NNRTIs and boosted PIs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Shuter, 2008</a>). This is likely because the half-life of most unboosted PIs is sufficiently short that missed doses create conditions in which the virus is not suppressed. It is therefore possible that resistance is primarily found in patients with poor adherence, and in these patients, resistance could arise deterministically via soft sweeps. In addition, we may underestimate the number of DRMs for PIs, as some DRMs are likely to be outside of the sequenced regions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Juno et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rabi et al., 2013</a>).

Whereas early antiretroviral treatments were associated with fast evolution of drug resistance and high rates of treatment failure, there are currently many combinations of drugs that are successful at keeping HIV-1 at low or undetectable levels for many years, preventing the evolution of resistance and the progression to AIDS. Indeed, the evolution of drug resistance has become fairly uncommon (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). In this paper, we\u00a0have shown that this shift from fast to slow evolution of drug resistance has been accompanied by a corresponding shift from soft selective sweeps (in which the same DRM occurs on multiple genetic backgrounds) to hard selective sweeps (in which a DRM occurs only a single time). This suggests that modern treatments have brought HIV into a regime where the viral population must wait until the correct mutation or combination of mutations is generated. This also means that for any given patient the acquisition of drug resistance has become at least partly an unlucky occurrence, in sharp contrast to the early days of HIV treatment in which all patients predictably failed treatment. Harder sweeps within well-treated patients are also consistent with the overall decrease in the rate of resistance."

Because it would be unethical to give subpar treatment to HIV infected patients, we can only investigate this question using historical data. The only type of data that is available for a wide range of treatments and time points is Sanger sequencing data, due to its importance in HIV research and diagnostic testing. Although we often have only one sequence per patient, it is important to note that there is still information present in these sequences about genetic diversity and selective sweeps. First, we used ambiguous nucleotide calls as a proxy for genetic diversity. Although we are not the first study to do so (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kouyos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Poon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>), as far as we are aware, we are the first to use clonal sequences to validate its accuracy as a measure. Second, we can use the number of fixed drug resistance mutations to determine how much adaptation to treatment has taken place. We used a fairly conservative list of DRMs that are very unlikely to fix in the absence of the drug (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mespl\u00e8de et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gonzalez et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cong et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, DRMs must have fixed as a result of strong positive selective pressure imposed by the drug, and are indicative of recent selective sweeps. We can then look at the correlation between the number of drug resistance mutations and genetic diversity and see if that relationship has changed across treatments and time. Because this approach relies only on widely-available Sanger sequences, we were able to compare 29 different treatments, from AZT monotherapy to treatments based on boosted PIs, sampled across more than two decades (1989\u20132013)."

In addition, we find that having more DRMs is associated with a greater reduction in diversity. This pattern could be generated by successive selective sweeps, in which DRMs are fixed one by one and each selective sweep lowers the diversity further. Alternatively, multiple DRMs may have fixed simultaneously in a single selective sweep."

For example, among patients given treatments with 50% effectiveness, sequences with 3 DRMs are predicted to have approximately the same number of ambiguous calls as those with 0 DRMs. In contrast, among those patients given treatments with 80% effectiveness, sequences with 3 DRMs are predicted to have over 50% fewer ambiguous calls than those with 0 DRMs, a substantial decrease in genetic diversity. Thus, the higher the treatment effectiveness, the more DRMs are associated with low genetic diversity. This is consistent with drug resistance evolution dominated by soft selective sweeps when failure rates were high, transitioning over time to evolution dominated by hard selective sweeps as treatments improved and failure rates became much lower. Clinically effective treatments are thus characterized by a more frequent occurrence of hard selective sweeps."

Sequences in that study came from patients who were mostly treated with EFV + IDV, a combination that never became common and is not represented here, but which has an estimated effectiveness of 75% (<a href=\"#bib42\">Staszewski et al., 1999</a>). The study examined selective sweeps in those patients by looking at the fixation of a particular DRM, at amino acid 103 in RT, which changes from Lysine (K, wild type) to Asparagine (N, resistant). K103N is special because it can be caused by two different mutations, as the wild type codon AAA can mutate to AAT or AAC, both of which encode Asparagine. When focusing on patients whose virus acquired the K103N mutation, the study found that in some patients, both the AAT and AAC codons were found (which is clear evidence that a soft sweep has happened, see\u00a0Figure\u00a01 in the original paper), whereas in other cases only one of the two was there (which suggests that a hard sweep may have happened, see\u00a0Figure\u00a02 in the original paper). Because of the detailed data available for these patients, it was shown that both soft and hard sweeps were occurring almost equally often. Placing the 75% effectiveness of EFV+IDV in the context of our above results, this is also what we would have predicted. Now we know that this result (hard and soft selective sweeps occur) is not necessarily something that will be generally true for HIV, but rather it is a function of the effectiveness of the treatment. Had Pennings et al. had data from a much worse or much better treatment, they might have concluded that hard sweeps or soft sweeps were the rule in HIV."

The incremental changes in effectiveness and the evolutionary dynamics are worth noting because a simplified narrative sometimes suggests that solving the drug resistance problem in HIV was achieved simply by using three drugs instead of two (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stearns and Koella, 2007</a>). According to this narrative, HIV can always easily evolve resistance when treatment is with one or two drugs, but it is virtually impossible for the virus to become resistant to three drugs. In truth, only some specific combinations seem to lead to more favorable evolutionary dynamics for patients (as seen in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>)."

Better drugs may allow for a faster collapse of population size, decreasing the probability that one or more \u2018escape\u2019 DRMs occurs ([<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 2014</a>], although see [<a href=\"#bib28\">Moreno-Gamez et al., 2015</a>]). Alternatively, suppressed HIV populations may continue replicating at small numbers, and better drugs may cause this replicating population to be smaller than among patients given inferior drugs. Similarly, a treated patient may retain a reservoir of HIV unreachable by the treatment, and better drugs may make this reservoir smaller. If newer drugs have fewer side effects and therefore improve adherence among patients, this too could result in a smaller within-patient population size among patients treated with better drugs, and contribute to the decreased production of resistant genotypes. The effect could also be driven by standing genetic variation, if worse drugs would allow pre-existing mutations to establish, whereas better drugs make this less likely, for example, if a pre-existing mutation could only establish if it occurred in a small and specific compartment (<a href=\"#bib28\">Moreno-Gamez et al., 2015</a>). Finally, more effective drug combinations may simply require more mutations on the same background (i.e., a higher genetic barrier to resistance [<a href=\"#bib44\">Tang and Shafer, 2012</a>]), so the effective mutation rate to a fully resistant genotype is lower. Our data do not give us sufficient resolution to distinguish between these hypotheses, and the true dynamics may be a combination of all of these factors. However, all these potential mechanisms work to reduce the rate of production of resistant genotypes and the principle is more general: if the probability of acquiring resistance is low, rare resistance should be generated by hard selective sweeps."

We have sequences from only one or two genes, and so it is possible that there are DRMs or other selected mutations driving population dynamics outside of the sequenced regions (particularly among patients treated with protease inhibitors). The DRMs that are observed may be associated with variable selection coefficients and may therefore differ in their rate of expansion in the population and thus the associated signature of the selective sweep. Additionally, DRMs occurring later in the course of an infection may have smaller beneficial effects as compared to early DRMs. Different patients may have varying profiles of diversity at the time of diagnosis, which could also effect whether sweeps will be hard or soft. All of these items could serve to obscure the relationship between DRM fixation and changes in diversity, but our results appear robust despite the substantial noise."

Improved disease monitoring may mean that modern patients have a shorter time between the appearance of a DRM and its sequencing and discovery.

However, Pennings et al. estimate that sweep signatures require a substantial amount of time to erode (on the order of months) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pennings et al., 2014</a>), so we do not believe that this effect alone can explain the pattern. Alternatively, if DRMs acquired in response to earlier treatments have lower selection coefficients than treatments given more recently, early selective sweeps would take longer. Recombination could move DRMs to multiple genetic backgrounds before the mutation fixes in the population. This would also also result in muted changes in diversity among early treatments that could not be readily distinguished from the signatures of soft sweeps.

Among patients receiving PIs, only patients with both protease and reverse transcriptase sequences were included. All sequence information in the HIV database is recorded as aligned consensus nucleotide sequences. The data are taken across many studies, each with their own procedures and cutoffs for calling positions ambiguous. No electropherogram data were available and the ambiguous calls reported were taken as submitted to the database. The sequences from these patients were labeled the direct PCR (D-PCR) dataset."

For a portion of the analysis, we rely on examining many HIV-1 sequences from patients being treated with the same drug regimen. Because we measure the association between the number of DRMs and genetic diversity by examining a slope (<math id=\"inf63\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>R</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow></msub></math>), our signal could be heavily influenced by single patients if the distribution of patients with a certain number of DRMs within a given treatment is narrow (e.g., a treatment has almost only patients with 0 DRMs). To ensure that that our observed signal is not driven by these cases, we exclude treatments if among the sequences from a treatment we do not have at least three sequences within three of the DRM categories (0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 DRMs). This restriction yielded a dataset with 5848 sequences from 29 treatments and was termed the abundant treatment dataset.

Our literature review was mostly based on the papers reviewed in Lee et al (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 2014</a>).

While all samples were Sanger sequenced, we do find that the number of recorded ambiguous calls increased over time (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), possibly because the cut-off of calling a read as ambiguous became lower. This effect, taken on aggregate across all sequences was not significant (p=0.09, linear regression with year predicting the number of ambiguous calls). However, when examining only sequences with 0 DRMs, a strong positive correlation emerges, with each year associated with 0.56 more ambiguous calls per sequence (p=4.9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>). That the difference in effect can be seen in the zero DRM class but not among sequences with any number of DRMs underscores the strong interaction between low diversity and multiple DRMs among modern treatments."

In this model, length, the number of DRMs and an intercept term are fit as fixed effects, and the number of DRMs by treatment is fit as a random effect.

It is also shown that more effective HIV treatments (according to several related definitions) lead to an increased anticorrelation between diversity and the number of drug resistance mutations (DRMs). This is interpreted as evidence that more efficacious drugs lead to harder selective sweeps and hence greater reductions in diversity per DRM. Overall this is an interesting manuscript that does its best to use data collected for another purpose to study an interesting issue in evolutionary dynamics."

While much of the information concerning caution about our analysis was present in the original draft, we have consolidated the information into an expanded set of paragraphs in the Discussion. We have further grouped these caveats into separate categories: 1) data-specific noise factors that should obscure the signal, 2) properties of the data that might contribute to our observed signal that we control for within the analysis and 3) properties of the data that might contribute to our observed signal that are not possible to control. For each of these potential biases, we discuss why we do not believe that they generate the patterns seen in our data. The particular issue related to treatment monitoring described by the reviewers is included in this third category.

Therefore, better treatments (from later years) have a higher 0 DRM category than worse treatments (from earlier years). We controlled for the effect of year in the model, but the particular way in which that graph was plotted did not (and cannot) properly display the effect of year across the different treatments (as each treatment is comprised of patients from across multiple years).

This new figure shows how the intercepts within the model are set to have the same 0 DRM diversity. This can now be done because the diversity for treatment types from different years are rescaled to be comparable before the model is fit."
