Following collision with a RFB, replication proteins can dissociate from the stalled fork (fork collapse) rendering it incapable of further DNA synthesis unless recombination intervenes to restart replication. We use time-lapse microscopy and genetic assays to show that recombination is initiated within \u223c10 min of replication fork blockage at a site-specific barrier in fission yeast, leading to a restarted fork within \u223c60 min, which is only prevented/curtailed by the arrival of the opposing replication fork. The restarted fork is susceptible to further collapse causing hyper-recombination downstream of the barrier. Surprisingly, in our system fork restart is unnecessary for maintaining cell viability. Seemingly, the risk of failing to complete replication prior to mitosis is sufficient to warrant the induction of recombination even though it can cause deleterious genetic change."

Following collision with a RFB, replication proteins can dissociate from the stalled fork (fork collapse) rendering it incapable of further DNA synthesis unless recombination intervenes to restart replication. We use time-lapse microscopy and genetic assays to show that recombination is initiated within \u223c10 min of replication fork blockage at a site-specific barrier in fission yeast, leading to a restarted fork within \u223c60 min, which is only prevented/curtailed by the arrival of the opposing replication fork. The restarted fork is susceptible to further collapse causing hyper-recombination downstream of the barrier. Surprisingly, in our system fork restart is unnecessary for maintaining cell viability. Seemingly, the risk of failing to complete replication prior to mitosis is sufficient to warrant the induction of recombination even though it can cause deleterious genetic change."

This genetic material is made up of two single strands of DNA that are paired to form a double-stranded helix. Certain groups of proteins separate these two DNA strands to form a two-pronged structure known as a \u2018replication fork\u2019. This occurs at different points along the length of the DNA double helix. Groups of proteins then travel down the DNA strands, separating them as they go, and using them as templates for making copies of the DNA."

Nguyen et al. found that a protein called Rad52 arrives at this specific site within 10 minutes of a replication fork being blocked. This protein enables recovery of the replication fork within an hour via a process known as \u2018DNA recombination\u2019."

It is known from previous work that the mechanisms that repair broken DNA and rescue replication forks can also introduce errors into the DNA. This implies that if fork collapse occurs frequently, it can lead to the introduction of numerous errors that can be detrimental to cells. Thus, the rescue of fork collapse is like a double-edged sword; it is required for replication to proceed, but can lead to genetic changes inside cells. The failure to faithfully replicate genetic material drives the development of diseases such as cancer. Therefore, insights gained from Nguyen et al.'s findings may provide an improved understanding of how genetic alterations occur in both normal and cancerous cells."

In many cases, these cause only a transient stalling of replication during which the replication proteins (replisome) remain engaged with the DNA by a fork protection mechanism mediated by the intra-S-phase checkpoint (<a href=\"#bib15\">Errico and Costanzo, 2012</a>). However, the replisome can sometimes dissociate to produce a collapsed fork, which may also be associated with breakage of the DNA, and this is especially prevalent following oncogene activation in human cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Halazonetis et al., 2008</a>). Homologous recombination (HR) can restore fork integrity and restart replication, via a process termed break-induced replication (BIR) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anand et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Costantino et al., 2014</a>). BIR has mainly been studied in the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> away from the context of DNA replication, using systems that generate a site-specific DNA double-strand break (DSB) that is repaired by recombination with a donor DNA molecule containing sequence homology to only one side of the break (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anand et al., 2013</a>). It is, therefore, unclear to what extent these studies reflect how recombination acts to repair stalled and broken replication forks during S-phase."

Rad52 mediates the subsequent loading of Rad51, which catalyses the key steps of homologous DNA pairing and strand invasion to form a displacement (D) loop. The 3' end of the invading DNA strand primes DNA synthesis by polymerase \u03b4, and replication then proceeds in a conservative manner involving migration of the D-loop, dependent on the Pif1 DNA helicase (<a href=\"#bib49\">Saini et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wilson et al., 2013</a>). Similar to other modes of DSB repair by HR, the initial steps of BIR from DSB resection to strand invasion occur within \u223c30 min of DSB formation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jain et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hicks et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, the transition from strand invasion to DNA replication is delayed for several hours by a checkpoint that senses whether both ends of the DSB can engage with the same donor DNA sequence in a manner that is productive for completing repair (<a href=\"#bib35\">Malkova et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jain et al., 2009</a>). However, once initiated DNA synthesis proceeds at a rate of 3\u20134 kb/min, which is comparable with normal DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib35\">Malkova et al., 2005</a>)."

This feature of BIR is thought to reflect an inherent drive to repair the DSB by synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Smith et al., 2007</a>). However, beyond 10 kb the D-loop appears to be stabilized, and BIR proceeds without the continual interruption of D-loop dissociation."

Similar to BIR, <i>RTS1</i>-induced RDR is error-prone, at least within the first 2.4 kb downstream of the barrier (<a href=\"#bib22\">Iraqui et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mizuno et al., 2013</a>). However, it is unknown whether it suffers the same tendency for D-loop dissociation as BIR. It also remains unclear whether recombination is a default response to replication fork blockage at <i>RTS1</i>, how quickly it initiates, and whether it only plays a role in restart at the blocked fork, or is also needed to promote fork merging."

We show that Rad52 is recruited to <i>RTS1</i> in the majority of cells within minutes of fork blockage and seemingly gives rise to RDR without the long delay in progressing from strand invasion to DNA synthesis that is characteristic of BIR. However, like BIR the restarted fork is prone to multiple rounds of strand disengagement and reengagement, implying that even at a blocked replication fork during S-phase the default response is to attempt SDSA. Unlike BIR, this continues for more than 10 kb downstream of the barrier with little sign of abating, giving rise to a dramatic increase in recombination in this region. We also find that fork convergence, rather than inducing recombination, acts to prevent or curtail it. Surprisingly, despite the high frequency of the recombination response and contrary to previous reports, we find no evidence that it is required for cell viability. Seemingly, the risk of failing to complete DNA replication in a timely fashion is sufficient to warrant the initiation of RDR as a default response to replication fork collapse, even though in many cases it may be unnecessary and even cause deleterious genetic change."

Replication of the <i>ade6</i> locus is essentially unidirectional due to the relative position of replication origins that flank it (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Consequently, only one orientation of <i>RTS1</i> causes replication fork blockage at this site, which we will refer to as the active orientation (AO). The opposite orientation, which does not block replication, will be referred to as the inactive orientation (IO). Native two dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis analysis of replication intermediates in an EcoNI fragment containing <i>RTS1</i> confirms that <i>RTS1-AO</i> strongly blocks replication forks, whereas <i>RTS1-IO</i> does not (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). It also shows that a proportion of forks remain blocked at <i>RTS1-AO</i> long enough for replication to be completed by the opposing fork resulting in fork merging at <i>RTS1</i> as indicated by the appearance of double Y-shaped molecules (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>).

However, in previous work from our laboratory, we failed to detect such an increase at <i>RTS1-AO</i> suggesting that RDR does not occur at appreciable levels in our experimental system (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lorenz et al., 2009</a>). The method of DNA extraction for 2D gel analysis can have a significant effect on the ability to detect different types of replication intermediates (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liberi et al., 2006</a>). Our standard protocol is based on mechanical cell disruption to extract nuclei, DNA purification by caesium chloride density gradient centrifugation, and enrichment for replication intermediates on benzoylated napthoylated DEAE (BND) cellulose columns (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lorenz et al., 2009</a>). In contrast, <a href=\"#bib26\">Lambert et al. (2010)</a> enzymatically lyse cells embedded in agarose plugs prior to enrichment of replication intermediates on BND cellulose. To determine whether these differences could account for our failure to detect an increase in converging forks, we compared replication intermediates in the EcoNI fragment containing <i>RTS1-AO</i> from wild-type and a <i>rad51\u2206 rad52\u2206</i> double mutant using the same protocol of DNA extraction as <a href=\"#bib26\">Lambert et al. (2010)</a>. A <i>rad51\u2206 rad52\u2206</i> double mutant was used instead of a <i>rad52\u2206</i> single mutant because of the latter's susceptibility to acquire suppressor mutations that enable Rad51 to catalyse HR in the absence of Rad52 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Osman et al., 2005</a>). Unlike <a href=\"#bib26\">Lambert et al. (2010)</a>, we did not observe an increase in double Y-shaped molecules, in fact they decreased by \u223ctwofold in the <i>rad51\u2206 rad52\u2206</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). However, the reduction in large Ys was even greater (\u223csixfold) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), such that their ratio to double Ys decreased more than threefold (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These data indicate that Rad52 plays an important role in promoting replication past <i>RTS1-AO</i>. We suspect that a <i>rad51\u2206 rad52</i>\u2206 mutant fails to manifest an increase in double Y-shaped molecules because the effect of an increased frequency of fork convergence at <i>RTS1-AO</i> is offset by a faster rate of fork merging, due to the absence of recombination proteins that could impede this process."

Mindful that the <i>lacO</i>-LacI interaction can act as a RFB (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sofueva et al., 2011</a>), we determined imaging parameters under which the amount of LacI, whilst sufficient to detect the location of the <i>lacO</i> array through several hours of live cell imaging, was insufficient to perturb replication forks as judged by native 2D gel analysis (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) or induce a recombinational response (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Having established suitable conditions, we imaged asynchronously growing cells containing either <i>RTS1-IO</i> or <i>RTS1-AO</i> and Rad52 fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), which forms foci in response to DNA damage similar to its homologue in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lisby et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Meister et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Time-lapse movies of cells, with images taken at 5-min intervals, were staged relative to anaphase, and the presence of Rad52 foci and their co-localization with <i>lacO</i>-LacI foci recorded over a 90-min period (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The majority (\u226579%) of cells exhibited a single Rad52 focus at varying time points mainly between 20 and 90 min post-anaphase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This is true even for cells without <i>RTS1</i> and reflects the fact that HR is routinely needed to process perturbed replication forks and DNA damage that occurs during S-phase (data not shown). Consistent with replication fork blockage at <i>RTS1</i> inducing HR, a higher percentage of cells with <i>RTS1-AO</i> exhibited a Rad52 focus than those with <i>RTS1-IO</i> (89% vs 79%), and on average, these foci were detected over a greater number of time points (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). Imaging of <i>RTS-AO</i> and <i>RTS-IO</i> cells without <i>lacO</i>-LacI revealed no difference in the occurrence and timing of Rad52 foci confirming that <i>lacO</i>-LacI acts as an inert marker for the location of <i>RTS1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>)."

CFP-PCNA forms patterns of foci that are characteristic for the different stages of S-phase (<a href=\"#bib38\">Meister et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and under our experimental conditions these foci first appear between 10 and 15 min post-anaphase, marking the start of S-phase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In cells containing <i>RTS1-AO</i>, Rad52 foci co-localizing with <i>lacO</i>-LacI first appear between 20 and 25 min post-anaphase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3C and 5B</a>). This lag between the start of S-phase and appearance of Rad52 foci at the RFB is also observed when both CFP-PCNA and Rad52-YFP are imaged concurrently in the same cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). As the nearest replication origin to <i>RTS1-AO</i> is \u223c7.7 kb away (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), the earliest a fork can reach the barrier is \u223c2.6 min after the start of S-phase, based on an average fork velocity of \u223c3 kb/min (<a href=\"#bib19\">Heichinger et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, Rad52 can be recruited to <i>RTS1-AO</i> as early as 7.4\u201312.4 min after replication fork blockage. The later appearance of Rad52 foci at <i>RTS1-AO</i> that is observed in many cells (ranging mainly from 30 to 55 min post-anaphase) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), likely reflects the later blockage of forks that emanate from more distal origins (i.e., <i>ori-1338</i>, <i>ori-1342</i>, and <i>ori-1371</i>), which would arrive at the barrier from 7.7 to 18.5 min after the start of S-phase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). In a few cells (\u223c5%), we observed Rad52 foci first co-localizing with <i>lacO</i>-LacI at 60\u201380 min post-anaphase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). These very late appearing co-localizing foci may represent cells in which one or both forks converging on <i>RTS1</i> have been delayed by other RFBs or possibly a recombinational response to occasional problems that might occur during fork convergence."

If one considers only the longest track of consecutive time points with a co-localization in each cell, then the duration of any single-event ranges from 1 to 9 time points (average = 3.4 time points), which equates to &gt;0 to &lt;45 min (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). However, as these estimates are based on images taken every 5 min, we cannot be certain that Rad52 does not dissociate and then re-associate with the site in between points of image acquisition. The percentage of cells with PCNA foci begins to decline approximately 40\u201345 min after anaphase (i.e., 30\u201335 min after the start of S-phase) and by 70 min they are detectable in less than 20% of all cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). S-phase in <i>S. pombe</i> has been calculated to take \u223c20 min (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mitchison and Creanor, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Heichinger et al., 2006</a>); however, the persistence of PCNA foci suggests that the completion of DNA replication can take a lot longer and will often span into what is considered to be G2-phase. By comparing the timings of when Rad52 co-localizes with <i>lacO</i>-LacI with those when PCNA foci are detectable (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), we conclude that in most cells Rad52's association with <i>RTS1-AO</i> ends before the disappearance of PCNA foci, that is, during S-phase or early G2-phase. Indeed, when Rad52-YFP and CFP-PCNA are imaged simultaneously, the co-localization of Rad52 with <i>lacO</i>-LacI terminates before the disappearance of PCNA foci in \u223c71% of cells with <i>RTS1-AO</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The remaining \u223c29%, which exhibit a <i>lacO</i>-LacI co-localizing Rad52 focus beyond the point at which PCNA foci are no longer detectable, may represent cells with ongoing RDR in G2-phase or where fork convergence at <i>RTS1</i> has been problematic and therefore caused a recombinational response."

Although the significance of this remains uncertain, it does suggest that replication fork blockage by <i>RTS1</i> can give rise to distinct and temporally separable problems in the vicinity of the <i>lacO</i> array that in each case provoke recombination."

Based on these data, the known location of the origins and a fork velocity of 3 kb/min, we can conclude that the time between replication fork blockage and convergence at <i>RTS1</i> will vary from cell-to-cell, and we have made an estimate for what these times will be (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In some cells, fork convergence will occur within 10 min of the first fork arriving at <i>RTS1-AO</i>, providing insufficient time for Rad52 recruitment before replication of the region is completed.

If forks emanating from this origin prevent and curtail HR at <i>RTS1-AO</i>, then there should be an increase in both the frequency and duration of Rad52 foci co-localizing with <i>lacO</i>-LacI. Indeed, this is exactly what we observed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The percentage of <i>RTS1-AO</i>-containing cells exhibiting a Rad52 focus co-localizing with <i>lacO</i>-LacI increased from \u223c60 to \u223c80%, and the average duration of these foci increased from 3.4 time points (12 to &lt;17 min) to 5.8 (24 to &lt;29 min) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Together, these data indicate that recombination operates in the interval between fork blockage and convergence, and if this is too short there will be insufficient time for recombination proteins to act. Moreover, we can conclude that fork convergence is capable of terminating ongoing recombination and does not itself normally induce HR."

Therefore, our data indicate that the restarted fork must suffer disengagement of the elongating nascent strands to facilitate HR. This is reminiscent of BIR, which is prone to template switching within the first 10 kb from the DSB (<a href=\"#bib51\">Smith et al., 2007</a>)."

Template switching associated with restarted replication has been shown to decrease with distance from the point of initiation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Smith et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mizuno et al., 2013</a>), and therefore, it seemed likely that the decline in recombination frequency from site A to site B was a consequence of the maturation of the restarted fork as it progressed from the <i>RTS1</i> barrier site. However, it was also possible that replication fork convergence was preventing some restarted forks from progressing as far as site B. To investigate this, we measured the recombinant frequency at site B in strains in which <i>ori-1253</i> was deleted (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Surprisingly, with <i>RTS1-AO</i>, the frequency of gene conversions increased by 54-fold and deletions by 225-fold compared to <i>RTS1-IO</i> levels, which also represents an overall \u223c1.5-fold increase in recombinants compared to site A.

There are many examples of weaker RFBs, which cause fork stalling without inducing HR either because the block is quickly removed by an accessory helicase or the intra-S-phase checkpoint is activated to stabilize the replisome and thereby prevent fork collapse (<a href=\"#bib3\">Azvolinsky et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Errico and Costanzo, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sabouri et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Steinacher et al., 2012</a>). However, in the case of <i>RTS1</i>, the accessory helicase Pfh1 fails to dislodge the barrier (<a href=\"#bib54\">Steinacher et al., 2012</a>), and the intra-S-phase checkpoint seemingly remains inactive resulting in fork collapse (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lambert et al., 2005</a>). Importantly, in wild-type cells breakage of forks blocked at <i>RTS1</i> is not a frequent event and therefore cannot account for the recruitment of Rad52 in the majority of cells (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahn et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mizuno et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lambert et al., 2010</a>). Additional evidence that fork breakage is an uncommon event at <i>RTS1</i> comes from unpublished data showing that replication fork breakage induced by a site-specific single-strand break, placed at the same position as <i>RTS1</i>, causes a quite different frequency of recombinants in a <i>rad51\u2206</i> mutant than <i>RTS1-AO</i>. In the case of <i>RTS1-AO rad51\u2206</i> causes approximately a 50% reduction in deletions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahn et al., 2005</a>), whereas with a site-specific single-strand break it causes a 10-fold increase (unpublished data). We suspect that the residual deletions that form in <i>rad51\u2206 RTS1-AO</i> cells stem from Rad52-mediated 'strand invasion' (similar to Rad51-independent BIR in budding yeast [<a href=\"#bib2\">Anand et al., 2013</a>]) and/or DSB-independent single-strand annealing that could occur during fork convergence."

This is broadly in line with the kinetics of Rad52 focus formation following exposure of cells to \u03b3-irradiation, which occurs within 30 min of break formation (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barlow and Rothstein, 2009</a>). However, it takes a further 40 min for DNA synthesis to start, which suggests that the assembly of the replication machinery is quite slow (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hicks et al., 2011</a>). In the case of BIR, DNA synthesis is delayed even longer (a further 2\u20134 hr) by a recombination execution checkpoint (<a href=\"#bib35\">Malkova et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jain et al., 2009</a>). We estimate that Rad52-YFP focus formation can occur as early as 7.4\u201312.4 min after replication fork blockage at <i>RTS1</i>, which is comparable with the kinetics of DSB repair in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, bearing in mind that Rad52 precedes Rad51 in loading onto RPA-coated ssDNA.

Our observation that deleting <i>ori-1253</i> dramatically increases recombinant frequency at site B indicates that progression of the restarted fork is constrained by fork convergence. Therefore, the fact that we detect recombination at sites A and B means that some restarted forks reach these sites before the opposing fork emanating from one of the four centromere proximal origins (assuming that at least one of these origins fires in every cell cycle) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The most distant of these origins (<i>ori-1141</i>) lies \u223c186 kb away from site A and \u223c174 kb away from site B, which means that RDR would have up to \u223c60 min from the point of fork blockage at <i>RTS1</i> to reach these sites, assuming a normal replication fork velocity of 3 kb/min and similar firing times for the origins that flank the RFB. Based on these estimates, it would appear that the overall temporal kinetics of RFB-induced RDR in <i>S. pombe</i> are either similar or faster than those of DSB-induced HR at the mating-type locus in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, and much faster than BIR, presumably due to the absence of a recombination execution checkpoint."

                                "text": "We have previously proposed that reversal of the collapsed replication fork together with strand resection would generate a ssDNA tail onto which RPA, Rad52, and Rad51 would sequentially load (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sun et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Strand invasion would follow, creating a D-loop onto which replication proteins assemble and commence DNA synthesis. As discussed above, we estimate that this whole process would take between \u223c10 and 60 min. Previous studies have shown that RFB-induced RDR is prone to template slippage/switching (<a href=\"#bib22\">Iraqui et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mizuno et al., 2013</a>), and based on our work we can conclude that a major part of this infidelity must derive from an instability of the restarted fork, which enables the frequent engagement of HR proteins such as Rad51 that can then catalyse ectopic recombination. We suspect that this is because mechanistically RFB-induced RDR is similar to BIR involving a migrating bubble or D-loop at which conservative replication occurs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Saini et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wilson et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). One key difference, however, is that the invading DNA strand may remain connected to the reversed fork structure from where it originated. Lagging strand synthesis would convert the reversed fork into a fully ligated four-way DNA/Holliday junction, which could branch migrate behind the D-loop. This might be advantageous during convergence with a normal replication fork, which could drive dissociation of the D-loop through the action of the replisome's accessory DNA helicase Pfh1 translocating on the lagging template strand, thereby converting the restarted 'fork' back into a reversed fork at which fork merging could occur (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). In contrast, early resolution of the Holliday junction could result in a one-ended DSB during fork convergence and even a failure of fork termination leading to over-replication (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>)."

For example, any impedance of the D-loop's migration might result in the Holliday junction \u2018catching up\u2019 with it, driving its dissociation and thereby reforming a reversed fork. This would allow the reloading of HR proteins, which could then catalyse ectopic recombination at sites distant from the original RFB (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). The high frequency of ectopic recombination downstream of the RFB (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) suggests that dissociation of the putative migrating D-loop within <i>ade6-M375</i> frequently gives rise to strand invasion of <i>ade6-L469</i>. The high proportion of deletions suggests that the newly established D-loop tends to migrate beyond <i>ade6-L469</i> rather than dissociating a second time to trigger the possibility of re-invasion into <i>ade6-M375</i> and the formation of a <i>ade6</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> gene conversion. The extended tracks of Rad52 focus co-localization with <i>lacO</i>-LacI, which are especially prevalent in <i>ori-1253\u2206</i> cells and can last for more than 60 min (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), might be representative of multiple rounds of recombination caused by the frequent collapse of the restarted 'fork' as it moves away from <i>RTS1</i>. However, it is also possible that Rad52 remains associated with the restarted 'fork', enabling more rapid recovery of any subsequent collapse."

                                "text": "From an evolutionary standpoint, the rapid induction of HR following replication fork collapse may make sense if no checkpoint response is induced, as it would ensure that RDR commenced without unnecessary delay thereby maximizing the chance that genome duplication is completed in a timely manner. This would be especially important given that the initiation of RDR appears to have some kinetically slow steps. A failure to complete DNA replication prior to mitosis would result in DNA breakage and chromosome missegregation, and may account for pathologies such as micronuclei formation and chromothripsis that can drive cancer development in human cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Crasta et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Beuzer et al., 2014</a>). Presumably in our experimental system, RDR is unnecessary for maintaining cell viability because passive replication from one of the centromere proximal origins is sufficient to complete replication on time. However, the same may not be true at the <i>ura4</i> locus in <i>S. pombe</i> where replication fork blockage by <i>RTS1</i> imposes a definite requirement for HR to maintain cell viability (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lambert et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2010</a>). Although it should be noted that, unlike in our study, Lambert et al. made use of an inducible promoter to drive the overexpression of the fork barrier protein Rtf1, which might alter the nature of the RFB and the requirement for recombination proteins. One example where RDR most likely is needed to ensure that DNA replication is completed on time is at common fragile site loci in human cells, which replicate late in S-phase and with greater distances between active origins (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ozeri-Galai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mankouri et al., 2013</a>). This creates a scenario where the irreversible stalling of two converging replication forks would result in mitosis proceeding with a region of unreplicated DNA (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mankouri et al., 2013</a>). As discussed by others, the consequences of this may be far worse than the risks associated with RDR."

The fragments were amplified using primers oMW1625 + oMW1626 and oMW1627 + oMW1628 and cloned into the HindIII-SalI and SacI-SpeI sites in pAG32, respectively. pMJ20 and pMJ21 contain DNA fragments from the genomic region 3\u2032 of <i>ade6</i> to facilitate targeted integration of <i>RTS1-IO</i>-<i>hphMX4</i> (pMJ20) and <i>RTS1-IO</i>-<i>hphMX4</i> (pMJ21) \u223c0.2 kb 3\u2032 of the stop codon in <i>ade6</i>.

To integrate the <i>ade6</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> direct repeat recombination reporter \u223c12.4 kb away from the normal <i>ade6</i> locus, we first constructed a derivative of pFA6-KanMX6 (<a href=\"#bib4\">B\u00e4hler et al., 1998</a>) (pMW923) containing <i>ade6-M375</i>-<i>kanMX6</i> flanked by DNA fragments amplified from genomic DNA using primers oMW1617 + oMW1618 and oMW1619 + oMW1620.

Targeted replacement of <i>rad51</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> with <i>ECFP-rad51</i><sup><i>+</i></sup><i>-kanMX6</i> was achieved using a derivative of pFA6a-KanMX6, pMW624. A cassette containing <i>ECFP-rad51</i><sup><i>+</i></sup><i>-kanMX6</i> was amplified from this plasmid using primers oMW627 + oMW628 to incorporate <i>rad51</i> 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR sequences to facilitate gene targeting by homologous recombination. The <i>kanMX6</i> was later replaced with <i>arg3</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> by marker swapping. Strains in which <i>rad51</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> is replaced with <i>ECFP-rad51</i><sup><i>+</i></sup><i>-kanMX6</i> exhibit genotoxin sensitivity at a level that is intermediate between wild-type and a <i>rad51\u2206</i> mutant (unpublished data). To overcome this, we inserted a copy of <i>rad51</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> at the <i>ura4</i> locus by gene targeting using a EcoRV-DraIII fragment from pMW875. pMW875 was made by amplifying <i>rad51</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>, together with its 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs, from genomic DNA using primers oMW1257 + oMW1258 and cloning this into a StuI site in <i>ura4</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> in pREP42 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Basi et al., 1993</a>).

For the spot assay, the suspension was serially diluted in fivefold steps to 1 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> cells per millilitre, and a 10 \u00b5l aliquot of each suspension was spotted onto a EMMG plate. The plate was photographed after 4 days at 30\u00b0C. For the viability assay, suspensions were recounted to confirm cell densities, and then serial dilutions plated on EMMG in triplicate. Colonies were counted on the appropriate dilution plates after 5\u20136 days growth at 30\u00b0C. The assay was repeated three times to obtain mean values for the percentage of colony forming cells."

In brief, the authors show by live single cell analysis that the Rad52 recombination mediator is recruited to an <i>RTS1</i> blocked fork in almost every S-phase cell. However, many of the conclusions of the study are based on the assumption that Rad52 foci reflect ongoing recombination. While this may be true for repair of a DSB, it may not be the case for a transiently stalled/blocked replication fork. Therefore, it remains crucial to evaluate to what extent the observed Rad52 foci reflect ongoing recombinational restart of replication."

Contrary to expectation we observed no significant change in the timing or frequency of Rad52 co-localization with <i>lacO</i>-LacI when <i>rad51</i> was deleted. However, a caveat to this experiment is that the overall frequency and number of non-co-localizing Rad52 foci increases markedly in a <i>rad51\u2206</i> mutant, which could result in less protein being available for recruitment to the <i>RTS1-AO</i> site. Consequently we have not included these data in our revised manuscript. Instead we have focused on: 1) analyzing replication intermediates surrounding <i>RTS1-AO</i> in a <i>rad51\u2206 rad52\u2206</i> double mutant by 2D gel analysis (in line with the second experiment proposed by the reviewers); and 2) further imaging experiments to determine whether other recombination proteins in addition to Rad52 are recruited to the barrier. The new 2D gel analysis is presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and described in a new Results section entitled \u201cRad52 is required for replication past <i>RTS1-AO</i>\u201d. Consistent with Rad51 and/or Rad52 being required for RDR at <i>RTS1</i> we observe a loss of large Y-shaped DNA molecules past the barrier in a <i>rad51\u2206 rad52\u2206</i> double mutant. In the new imaging experiments (presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and described in a new Results section entitled \u201cBoth Rad51 and Rad54 are recruited to <i>RTS1-AO</i>\u201d we observe that both Rad51 and Rad54 co-localize with the <i>lacO</i>-LacI array adjacent to <i>RTS1-AO</i> at similar frequencies as Rad52. Importantly more than 90% of Rad52 foci that co-localize with <i>lacO</i>-LacI in <i>RTS1-AO</i> cells also co-localize with a Rad51 focus (indicating that Rad52 remains associated with the site after Rad51 has loaded, which could explain why we don\u2019t see an increase in Rad52 foci at the barrier in a <i>rad51\u2206</i> mutant).
