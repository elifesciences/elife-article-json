Here we report that IPs\u2019 neuron production is enhanced by abrogating filamin function, leading to the generation of periventricular neurons independent of normal neocortical neurogenesis and neuronal migration. Loss of Flna in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) led RGs to undergo changes resembling epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) along with exuberant angiogenesis that together changed the microenvironment and increased neurogenesis of IPs. We show that by collaborating with \u03b2-arrestin, Flna maintains the homeostatic signaling between the vasculature and NPCs, and loss of this function results in escalated Vegfa and Igf2 signaling, which exacerbates both EMT and angiogenesis to further potentiate IPs\u2019 neurogenesis. These results suggest that the neurogenic potential of IPs may be boosted in vivo by manipulating Flna-mediated neurovascular communication."

Here we report that IPs\u2019 neuron production is enhanced by abrogating filamin function, leading to the generation of periventricular neurons independent of normal neocortical neurogenesis and neuronal migration. Loss of Flna in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) led RGs to undergo changes resembling epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) along with exuberant angiogenesis that together changed the microenvironment and increased neurogenesis of IPs. We show that by collaborating with \u03b2-arrestin, Flna maintains the homeostatic signaling between the vasculature and NPCs, and loss of this function results in escalated Vegfa and Igf2 signaling, which exacerbates both EMT and angiogenesis to further potentiate IPs\u2019 neurogenesis. These results suggest that the neurogenic potential of IPs may be boosted in vivo by manipulating Flna-mediated neurovascular communication."

Derived from the apical-basally polarized epithelial-like multipotent neuroepithelial (NE) or radial glial (RG) progenitors of the ventricular zone (VZ), IPs constitute a heterogeneous cell population, undergo substantial evolutionary expansion, and contribute significantly to both increased number and function of cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hansen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kriegstein et al., 2006</a>). However, IPs are believed to have limited proliferation potential and can only divide once or twice before generating excitatory neurons that migrate radially to the cortical plate (CP) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Noctor et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Taverna et al., 2014</a>).

In the developing cerebral cortex, vascular circulation provides key factors to support NPC growth and differentiation. Conversely, VEGF-A produced by NPCs is indispensable for angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ogunshola et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wittko-Schneider et al., 2014</a>). The extensive communication between the vasculature and NPCs thereby permits the orchestration of angiogenesis with neurogenesis (<a href=\"#bib45\">Vasudevan et al., 2008</a>). However, the molecular control responsible for NPC-blood vessel congruency is yet to be defined; it is also unclear whether the neurogenic potential of IPs may be boosted by angiogenic manipulation."

Females who lose a copy of <i>FLNA</i> present Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia (PH or PVH), a disorder that manifests as grossly normal-appearing cerebral cortex but ectopically placed nodular gray matter along the lateral ventricles (<a href=\"#bib2\">Eksioglu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Fox et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Parrini et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sheen et al., 2001</a>), while males carrying germline <i>FLNA</i> mutations often die prenatally of severe hemorrhage and cardiovascular defects (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bernstein et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Eksioglu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Reinstein et al., 2013</a>). As <i>FLNA</i> encodes the 280\u2009kDa filamin A (FLNA) that together with FLNB and FLNC constitutes a family of large actin binding proteins, PH associated with <i>FLNA</i> loss-of-function mutations has been thought to be caused by an X-chromosome inactivation-mediated mosaic neuronal migration arrest, which assumed cortical neurons that inherited the mutant <i>FLNA</i> allele lacked actin promoted cell motility. However, radiological and pathological findings in both females and a rare case of a male infant with inherited <i>FLNA</i> mutations showed unremarkable neocortical size and structural aberration, (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ferland and Guerrini, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Guerrini et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Parrini et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Poussaint et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Reinstein et al., 2012</a>), implying more complex mechanisms than the actin based mechanical failure.

Similar to <i>FLNA</i> loss-of-function in males, mice with an engineered null mutation of <i>Flna</i> die embryonically of widespread hemorrhage that was accompanied by aberrant cardiovascular morphogenesis and cerebral cortical angiogenesis but not by neuronal migration defects (<a href=\"#bib3\">Feng et al., 2006</a>)."

Our data show that Flna acts synergistically with \u03b2-arrestin and serves as a cytoplasmic break to regulate the homeostatic communication between NPCs and the cerebral vasculature, and loss of this function results in failed dampening of growth signals between NPCs and blood vessels, leading to excessive angiogenesis and sustained epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like changes in RGs, which altogether alter IPs\u2019 microenvironment and increase their proliferation and neurogenesis. These findings reveal the dependence of FLNA in coordinated cerebral neurogenesis and vascularization and demonstrate the vascular impact on IPs\u2019 neurogenic plasticity."

As <i>Flna</i> conditional mutants (<i>Flna</i><sup>flox/y:Cre+</sup> , referred to as Flna<sup>cKO</sup>) only showed mild phenotype in neuroependyma defects (data not shown),we considered the co-expression and possible redundant function of Flna and filamin B (Flnb) in NPCs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib40\">Sheen et al., 2002</a>), generated compound mutants of Flna<sup>cKO</sup> and <i>Flnb</i>, and found the\u00a0abnormal presence of nodular neurons near lateral ventricles in the brain of these mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013F</a>). All Flna<sup>cKO</sup>; <i>Flnb</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice and approximately 20% of Flna<sup>cKO</sup>; <i>Flnb</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice (referred to collectively as Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> hereafter unless noted specifically) showed this phenotype. The periventricular neuronal nodules (referred to as PH hereafter) were variable in size, number, and distribution but presented exclusively in both cerebral hemispheres with mixed neurons and glia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We detected PH at birth (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>) and found that the occurrence of PH was spatially associated with disruption of the neuroependymal lining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Most neurons in the PH expressed <i>Cux1</i>, which defines late-born excitatory neurons in upper cortical layers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>), whereas very few PH neurons expressed <i>Foxp2</i>, which marks early-born neurons in the deep cortical layer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1I,J</a>). Despite the presence of a large number of periventricular neurons, the neocortex of Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> mice was well laminated and showed no change in either thickness or the number of cortical neurons relative to that of <i>Flna</i><sup>flox/y:Cre-</sup>; <i>Flnb</i><sup>+/-</sup> littermate controls (referred to as Ctrl hereafter unless noted specifically) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H\u2013J</a>). These findings are all consistent with radiological and pathological reports of PH patients with <i>FLNA</i> mutations, and they suggest that PH caused by filamin loss is a unique condition in which additional neurons were generated at no expense of neocortical structure."

We found significantly more neurons were born at both E14.5 and E16.5 in PH-associated columns (total number of BrdU+ neurons in the entire depth of cortical wall normalized to the length of the\u00a0ventricles), whereas BrdU+ cells in cortical columns lacking PH of the same mutant brain were not different from those in controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

While none of the compound\u00a0mutants showed a\u00a0discernible phenotype in NPC number and proliferation rate or structural organization of the VZ, SVZ, and CP at E12.5 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>), we started to observe disrupted adherence junctions (AJ) in a small number of RGs in Flna<sup>cKO-NPC</sup>; <i>Flnb</i><sup>-/-</sup> embryos at E13.5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The AJ defect in Flna<sup>cKO-NPC</sup>; <i>Flnb</i><sup>-/-</sup> embryos was an isolated event but very frequently coincided with the mislocalization of neighboring IPs (marked by Tbr2) to the apical side of the VZ (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, arrow). As development proceeded to mid-late stages of cortical neurogenesis, these phenotypes became more pronounced and were seen in both Flna<sup>cKO-NPC</sup>;<i>Flnb</i><sup>-/-</sup> and Flna<sup>cKO-NPC</sup>; <i>Flnb<sup>+/-</sup></i> mutants (also referred to as PH hereafter). However, the apical mislocalization of IPs was exclusively associated with the disassembly of AJs and remained sporadic without affecting the nearby cortical tissue (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>).

In contrast, Pax6 positively labeled RGs in the affected regions became scarce and showed decreased mitotic activities (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2E\u2013G</a>). Despite the severe disorganization of VZ and SVZ, the bulk of neurons destined for the neocortex and the structure of cortical plate were not interfered with (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013I</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D,H</a>). This finding was consistent with the lack of neocortical defect in PH brains and suggested that mislocalization of IPs to the periventricular space rendered them a more stimulative microenvironment, which expanded the IP pool and increased their neuronal production without affecting those IPs that were already fate-committed to generate neocortical neurons."

Furthermore, we found the sporadic RG junctional defect involved deconstruction of multiple epithelial junctional complexes beyond AJs. Loss of tight junction (TJ) protein ZO-1 and apical junction protein Pals1 in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> mutants was observed along with AJ disruption (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>, arrows). The broad disassembly of cell-cell junction complexes led to the dissolution of the apical F-actin belt yet remained confined and made no detectable impairment in neighboring cortical regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>, arrows). The profound defect of mutant RGs disrupted their apical-basally polarity as revealed by disorganized basal bodies and radial glial fibers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013K</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The RGs in the affected regions appeared to lose the apical constriction that maintains the integrity of their counterparts in the adjacent unaffected regions. Such imbalance in in apical constriction led to the invagination of regions where RGs were intact and sometimes result in the formation of rosette-like structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013K</a>, arrows and asterisks). As the VZ invagination occurred in the unaffected RGs, it suggested that it was a secondary effect caused by altered structure of those adjacent defective RGs as well as the increased proliferation and neurogenesis of neighboring IPs. These results suggest that filamin is primarily essential in RGs through which it maintains the VZ-SVZ compartmentalization by assuring RGs\u2019 polarity and apical adhesion. Loss of filamin thereby results in the mislocalization of IPs from the normal SVZ to VZ."

Despite the severe disruption of RGs in apical domains, basal radial glial fibers in the affected regions were largely intact (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore, the phenotype of loss of filamin only involves selected RGs and is confined in the apical domain. This is fundamentally different from previously reported cortical defects resulting from loss of structural maintenance by mutations of epithelial junctional molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, or RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42. Our data argue against a simple role of filamin in actin-dependent structural maintenance, and they instead suggest that the sporadic but comprehensive loss of epithelial-like characteristics as well as <i>Pax6</i> expression in selected mutant RGs represents a transition in their identity."

To test if the RG defects in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> VZ were associated with abnormal EMT, we first examined EMT promoting transcription factors Snail and Twist by in situ hybridization (ISH). After detecting <i>Snail1</i> and <i>Twist1</i> mRNAs in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> embryos and their control littermates, we overlaid ISH images with IH images of \u03b2-Catenin, Cadherin, Tbr2 or Tuj1 to identify the relationship between cells with high <i>Snail</i> or <i>Twist</i> and those with aberrant adhesion or ectopic localization. At E13.5 to E14, a small number of cells in the VZ of the Flna<sup>cKO;</sup><i>Flnb<sup>-/-</sup></i> cortex was found to express a higher level of <i>Snail1</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>). We showed that cells with elevated <i>Snail</i> were precisely those that lost AJs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>) and these <i>Snail</i><sup>high</sup> cells were also the nearest neighbors of the ectopic IPs and neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Similarly, increased expression of <i>Twist1</i> was also found to correlate with periventricular IP mislocalization and ectopic neuron generation in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The enhanced EMT-like change in the mutant RGs was further demonstrated by increased mesenchymal phenotypes indicated by an excess amount of Fibronectin (FN) in regions with weakened RG adhesion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Moreover, increased hyaluronic acid (HA), a mesenchymal extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein associated with rapid tissue remodeling, was shown by the mutant and coincided with disassembled AJs and ectopic neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Collectively, the concurrent loss of adhesion with gained mesenchymal ECM and EMT promoting transcription factors confirmed an EMT-like change in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> RGs, which can lead to profound alteration of gene expression and local ECM composition and create a brand new microenvironment to potentiate the transient amplification of the local IPs as well as their capacity in generating neurons."

                                "text": "To test the direct participation of FLNA in EMT, we studied the effect of mutant forms of filamin A (FLNA) on EMT induced by TGF\u03b2 in MDCK cells. Both filamin A and filamin B are composed of an N terminal actin binding domain (ABD) followed by 24 Ig-like repeats, the last of which mediates their homo and hetero-dimerization. The C-terminal domain of filamins is also unique in mediating numerous molecular interactions with cell signaling molecules (<a href=\"#bib4\">Feng and Walsh, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhou et al., 2010</a>). Thus, retroviruses producing an actin binding domain deleted FLNA (FLNA-\u0394ABD) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kainulainen et al., 2002</a>) and the FLNA C-terminal molecular interaction domain (FLNA-C, encompassing amino acids 2168\u20132647) were used to interrupt FLNA\u2019s role in actin remodeling and cell signaling, respectively. We found the EMT phenotypes of these two mutant lines were remarkably different from vector infected controls. While the FLNA-\u0394ABD line showed an\u00a0enhanced response to TGF\u03b2 in losing epithelial morphology, reducing junctional \u03b2-catenin, and transforming into fibroblast-like cells that produce higher levels of Fibronectin (FN) and HA, the FLNA-C cells showed impeded EMT with persistent epithelial morphology and decreased FN production (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). These results not only indicate that FLNA is an EMT regulator and likely plays a role in integrating EMT inducing signals with actin remodeling but also suggest that <i>FLNA</i> mutations could lead to aberrant EMT in epithelial cells of multiple tissues."

This suggested the essential contribution of a non-cell autonomous factor to sustain EMT promoting changes in the mutant RGs. We therefore looked for other phenotypes in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices and found that the sporadic RG and IP defects coincided with altered angiogenesis. During cortical development, blood vessels and NPCs develop congruently and vasculogenesis not only occurs in parallel to neurogenesis but also is tightly associated with the proliferative activity of IPs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Javaherian and Kriegstein, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Stubbs et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Vasudevan and Bhide, 2008</a>). Additional to previous reports, we found angiogenesis sprouting from pial arteries to ventricles preceded IP generation and proliferation. While blood vessels penetrated to the VZ by E12.5, they remained largely segregated from the IPs. By E13.5 to E14.5 both blood vessels and IPs showed a\u00a0substantial increase in abundance, and IPs started to intermingle with blood vessels and divide more robustly (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). At this stage blood vessels in the cortical VZ of Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> embryos were shown to be irregular in terms of abundance, distribution and structure compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013E</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Quantitative analysis of vessel density indicated an overall increase in the vascular bed of Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Although vascular endothelium cells (ECs) were intact and pericyte coverage was detectable, nascent vessels in the mutant were grossly coarse with larger caliber (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). While blood vessels in control cortices form a plexus in the CP and SVZ, many vessels in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices sprouted deeply to the periventricular space where they coincided with destructed RG adhesions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A, B, H</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A,C</a>). Remarkably, we found that the defective RGs as well as ectopic IPs and neurons in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices inevitably commingled with aberrant vessels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>). Cerebral hemorrhage and enlarged blood vessels were also seen in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> postnatal brains and found inside and/or adjacent to periventricular heterotopic neuronal nodules (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). These findings suggested strongly that the sporadic phenotype in selected RGs and IPs of Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices was associated with altered vascular structure and function."

In contrast, using a GFAP-Cre driver (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zhuo et al., 2001</a>) that conditionally ablated Flna from RGs after E13.5 recapitulated the PH-like phenotype of mice with Flna pan-NPC conditional knockout from early development (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). While these findings supported the primary requirement of Flna in RGs, they also demonstrated NPCs\u2019 or RGs\u2019 influence to cerebral angiogenesis. To ascertain that deleting Flna from NPCs resulted in vascular abnormality, we showed elevated production of several Vegfa isoforms in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortical tissue (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), which were in line with increased angiogenesis in these mutants. More interestingly, elevated <i>Vegfa</i> mRNA was spatially coincided with not only the enrichment of periventricular blood vessels but also the RG aberrance (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

Therefore, the higher Igf2 signals in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices can further increase the vascular permeability via elevated Vegfa, forming a positive feedback loop that escalates Igf2 release and its constitutive signaling (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>).

Out of numerous FLNA interacting proteins reported previously, \u03b2-arrestin plays an important role in both desensitizing IGF1R and controlling ERK activation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Girnita et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kovacs et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Scott et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>). \u03b2-arrestin is highly enriched in the developing cerebral cortex. To determine whether failed attenuation of mitogenic signals in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> RGs was due to an impaired \u03b2-arrestin function, we examined the Flna-\u03b2-arrestin interaction in embryonic cortical tissue by co-immunoprecipitation. Not only was \u03b2-arrestin detected in Flna immunoprecipitates, we also showed that Flna was specifically co-precipitated with immunoprecipitated \u03b2-arrestin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>), indicating Flna is a partner of \u03b2-arrestin in cortical NPCs. Therefore, our data together suggest that the interaction and corroboration of filamin and \u03b2-arrestin play an essential role in dampening the excessive Igf2 signals and maintaining a homeostatic communication between NPCs and blood vessels in the developing cerebral cortex. Loss of filamin impairs \u03b2-arrestin\u2019s role in down-regulating Igf2-Igfr signaling, which augments both vascular and NPC growth and activities."

Factors contributing non-cell-autonomously to the net gain of ectopic neurons produced by IPs include ECM changes from an EMT-like event as well as increased local angiogenesis and vascular activity. Our data indicate that the essential requirement of Flna in cerebral cortical development is to assure the homeostatic interaction among RGs, IPs, and nascent vasculature. By interacting with \u03b2-arrestin, Flna blocks the excessive communication between blood vessels and NPCs through attenuating growth signals. Therefore, loss of Flna results in constitutive activation of Igf1R to Erk signaling and increased production of Vegfa, which exacerbate both NPC and angiogenic responses in an escalating manner and cumulate to sustained EMT of RGs. These together resulted in altered niche of IPs and boosted their neurogenesis at locations where RG and vascular changes were irreversible."

The lack of impairment of neocortical neurons with the presence of PH is in line with a recent finding from a fate mapping study which suggests that NPCs destined to generate neurons in upper cortical layers become fate restricted in early corticogenesis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Franco et al., 2012</a>). It is also likely that RGs stop making cortical neurons directly after E13.5 so that the integrity of the apical compartment of the cortical VZ and the apical RG-RG junctions become dispensable for the generation and migration of neocortical neurons, and the bulk of neurons that migrate into the CP after E13.5 were from basally localized IPs. Overall, our findings support the notion that the neurogenic potential of NPCs can be manipulated and enhanced in vivo and there is likely a surplus of IP population that remains sensitive to microenvironmental inputs and is responsible for generating periventricular neurons in filamin mutants. It is especially appealing that the surplus NPCs and their neurogenic plasticity in the cerebrum of Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> mice occur at the level of IPs, since IPs are neuronal fate-restricted progenitors that only give rise to cortical neurons. The size and diversity of the IP pool increase with the neocortical evolution. IPs are believed to be responsible for the generation of the majority of the cortical projection/excitatory neurons and play an ongoing role in postnatal neurogenesis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hodge et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kowalczyk et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, factors that may alter the plasticity of IPs would specifically and directly boost neuron production. Identifying these factors may open a portal for inducing the specific generation of neurons in cerebral tissue without affecting cells of the other lineages. This could potentially increase the likelihood of neural stem/progenitor cell mediated therapeutic intervention."

Increased crosstalk among vascular ECs, RGs and IPs appears essential for a positive reinforcement that creates a favorable microenvironment for IPs\u2019 transient amplification and neurogenesis. One of the ways to establish such a microenvironment may be through blocking FLNA and its associated molecules\u2019 specific function in dampening the growth signaling in NPCs and their neighboring cells, since this could both augment the impact of growth factors from the blood circulation and potentiate EMT-like changes to alter the local ECM and cytomechanical properties. As a fundamental and multistep process for tissue morphogenesis, EMT involves the synergistic action of a hierarchical molecular network and is estimated to alter the expression of over a thousand genes. The ECM molecules produced by the resulting mesenchymal-like cells can create a brand-new microenvironment for both NPCs and ECs. Although PH represents an abnormal condition of increased IP neurogenesis, further defining the molecular signature of the periventricular niche responsible for increased neurogenesis in the FLNA mutant brain may provide key insights into the cell molecular tools required for boosting the neurogenic potential of IPs in cerebral tissue."

During cortical development, FLNA ensures proper neurovascular congruency by regulating bi-directional signaling and intercellular interaction between NPCs and vascular cells. Through collaborating with \u03b2-arrestin, FLNA serves as a cytoplasmic molecular break to attenuate the excessive growth signals and maintain the homeostasis at both cell and tissue levels. While our study reveals escalated Vegfa and Igf2 activities, imbalances in many other molecules and pathways could also be involved in promoting the NPC and vascular phenotypes in filamin deficient cortices. Besides Igf1R, \u03b2-arrestin can mediate the turnover and desensitization of many plasma membrane receptors through clathrin mediated endocytosis or by recruiting ubiquitin ligases (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lin et al., 2008</a>). FLNA has also been reported to interact with numerous membrane receptors and cell signaling adaptors\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Feng and Walsh, 2004</a>). The extraordinarily diverse array of molecular dynamics governed by neurovascular communication and EMT-like change of filamin mutant RGs, in fact, suggest that loss of filamin results in a complex alteration in the interplay of multiple cell types and molecules, which would be extremely interesting to elucidate in future studies."

Therefore, the ectopic neurons were unlikely produced by the defective RGs, and the BrdU labeling and cell cycle exit activities in PH<sup>+</sup> regions were largely from aplicalized IPs.

                    "text": "Our data suggest that the rosette-like structure in filamin mutants was due to EMT-like defects instead of a simple loss of cell adhesion, morphology or scaffold function of the mutant RGs. These RGs were no longer Pax6+ but instead provided altered ECM, changed vascular cues, and promoted extra local IP proliferation and neuron production, which may together physically push the adjacent unaffected RGs and lead to their invagination or rosette formation. Therefore, the formation of rosette is the by-product but not the prerequisite for PH, it did not interfere with neocortical neuronal migration and thus was different from the neuronal migration arrest that results in SBH. In theory, the formation of epithelial rosette is largely driven by increased acto- myosin-dependent apical constriction and changes in epithelial morphology in normal morphogenesis. But here we face a situation in which the rosettes formed around relatively normal RGs due to defects in their neighboring cells that lost apical constriction. We agree that it was somewhat speculative to talk about the tissue stiffness since we did not measure it. To address this extremely helpful critique, we made text revision to present more clear and objective conclusions."
