Sporozoites are formed within oocysts at the mosquito midgut wall and are released into the hemolymph, from where they invade the salivary glands and are subsequently transmitted to the vertebrate host. We found that a thrombospondin-repeat containing sporozoite-specific protein named thrombospondin-releated protein 1 (TRP1) is important for oocyst egress and salivary gland invasion, and hence for the transmission of malaria. We imaged the release of sporozoites from oocysts in situ, which was preceded by active motility.

The parasite lives in different organs within its vertebrate animal and insect hosts and to cope with these different environments it has a complex life cycle with several highly specialized life stages. To move from an infected mosquito into vertebrates the parasite produces spore-like cells called sporozoites that are able to enter different tissues and move very fast. These cells develop inside parasite-made structures called oocysts, which form at the stomach wall of the mosquito. After emerging from the oocyst, sporozoites float through the mosquito\u2019s circulatory system and eventually enter the salivary glands where they can be transmitted to vertebrates when the mosquito bites."

These host switches are often accompanied by population bottlenecks where just a few parasites are sufficient for infection.

A single <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite that\u00a0establishes itself in the mosquito gut is enough to form an extracellular oocyst, in which hundreds of sporozoites can develop to colonize the salivary gland and be injected back into the vertebrate host. In <i>Plasmodium</i> species that\u00a0infect mammals, a single sporozoite that\u00a0successfully enters a hepatocyte is enough to produce thousands of progeny red-blood-cell-invading merozoites that then cause a full infection. In order to progress to the next developmental stage, the fully formed parasites need to escape their respective host cell or the oocyst."

There is evidence from all three stages to\u00a0show\u00a0that the\u00a0release of parasites is dependent on a common set of specific proteins encoded by the parasite, including different proteases especially of the SERA family (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arisue et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Roiko and Carruthers, 2009</a>) but also other factors with no or unknown enzymatic activity (<a href=\"#bib56\">Roiko and Carruthers, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Wirth and Pradel, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Talman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ponzi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">de Koning-Ward et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ishino et al., 2009</a>). Egress from blood cells and hepatocytes has been filmed in spectacular detail (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abkarian et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sturm et al., 2006</a>), and exflagellation of microgametes has been studied extensively by light and electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sinden et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Deligianni et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wirth et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wilson et al., 2013</a>). These movies show, for example, the rapid rupture of the red blood\u00a0cell membrane upon release of merozoites (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abkarian et al., 2011</a>), as well as the perforation of the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) and the erythrocyte membrane to enable exflagellation of activated male gametocytes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sinden et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Deligianni et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wirth et al., 2014</a>). Finally, intravital microscopy in mice revealed the formation of merozoite-containing vesicles, termed merosomes, that bud from the infected hepatocyte (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sturm et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Baer et al., 2007</a>). By\u00a0contrast, we have no live visual information about sporozoite egress from oocysts. Indeed, despite the adaptation of new dynamic imaging approaches in parasite biology (<a href=\"#bib25\">Frischknecht, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">De Niz\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Amino and Suzuki, 2014</a>), the only evidence to\u00a0show how sporozoites egress from oocysts are images from electron microscopy. These show that sporozoites can appear in holes within the oocyst wall and the\u00a0basal lamina that surrounds the oocysts (<a href=\"#bib61\">Strome and Beaudoin, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Meis et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sinden and Strong, 1978</a>), but also suggest that oocysts could rupture to release many parasites simultaneoulsly (<a href=\"#bib45\">Meis et al., 1992</a>). Different species might use or prefer different ways to egress (<a href=\"#bib50\">Orfano et al., 2016</a>)."

                        "text": "A number of proteins have been identified as essential for sporozoite egress\u00a0from\u00a0oocysts of\u00a0the human malaria parasite <i>P. falciparum</i> and of\u00a0the rodent model malaria parasite <i>P. berghei</i> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Some of the parasite lines that\u00a0lack these proteins cannot exit the oocysts but can still migrate when mechanically released from oocysts whereas others cannot. Curiously,\u00a0parasites lacking the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) also fail to undergo productive motility and salivary gland invasion, yet they have no defect in egress from oocysts (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sultan et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">M\u00fcnter et al., 2009</a>). Nevertheless, sporozoites that\u00a0lack TRAP are still able to perform forms of unproductive movement, during\u00a0which\u00a0the parasite is attached at one focal spot to the substrate (<a href=\"#bib49\">M\u00fcnter et al., 2009</a>), which might be sufficient to force egress from oocysts. However, the number of non-related proteins that\u00a0function in egress, and the lack of any clear interaction between these proteins,\u00a0suggests that even more proteins are\u00a0involved in the\u00a0egress of\u00a0sporozoites\u00a0from oocysts. It was recently shown that the TRAP-family member MTRAP, previously thought to be important for red blood cell invasion by merozoites, is crucial for the egress of gametocytes from host cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kehrer et al., 2016a</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bargieri et al., 2016</a>). We rationalized that similar proteins might also play a role in oocyst egress and searched for distantly related TRAP-like proteins. This revealed an\u00a0as yet uncharacterized protein that\u00a0carries a single thrombospondin repeat, one of the two adhesive domains found in TRAP-family members. This thrombospondin-related protein 1, TRP1, also shared a transmembrane domain and a similar cytoplasmic tail with TRAP-family proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The\u00a0generation of TRP1-deficient parasites revealed a function for TRP1 in sporozoite egress from oocysts. Upon\u00a0filming sporozoite egress from oocysts\u00a0in isolated midguts, we found that motility precedes egress and that sporozoites that\u00a0lack TRP1 are not motile within oocysts. Intriguingly, isolated <i>trp1(-)</i> sporozoites can undergo motility, suggesting that TRP1 might play a role in activating sporozoite motility in vivo prior to egress from oocysts."

                                "text": "Within the mosquito, <i>Plasmodium</i> sporozoites display a repertoire of proteins that are important for egress from oocysts (SERA5, CSP, GAMA, SIAP-1, PCRMP3 and 4, and\u00a0CCp2 and 3), motility (e.g. TRAP, MAEBL\u00a0and S6) and salivary gland entry (e.g. TRAP\u00a0and MAEBL). CSP in particular is interesting as it is essential for sporozoite formation (<a href=\"#bib48\">M\u00e9nard et al., 1997</a>), as well as for\u00a0efficient egress from oocysts once sporozoites have formed (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Coppi et al., 2011</a>) and also for\u00a0sporozoite invasion of the salivary glands (<a href=\"#bib13\">Coppi et al., 2011</a>). While the structure of CSP's N-terminus is unknown, the \u03b1-thrombospondin repeat (\u03b1TSR) at the C-terminal end as well as the repeat region between the\u00a0N- and the\u00a0C-terminus have\u00a0been solved by x-ray crystallography and NMR (<a href=\"#bib21\">Doud et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Plassmeyer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ghasparian et al., 2006</a>). The \u03b1TSR is especially\u00a0interesting because this domain is believed to be involved in protein-protein interactions, as shown for the\u00a0TSRs of thrombospondin-1 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Iruela-Arispe et al., 1999</a>). Proteins containing TSRs are widespread among animals and protozoans and\u00a0are mostly extracellular or secreted proteins (<a href=\"#bib69\">Tucker, 2004</a>). Also, at least one TSR is contained within all proteins of the TRAP-family, including MTRAP, which was recently found to be important for gametocyte egress from red blood cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kehrer et al., 2016a</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bargieri et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Morahan et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In a search for uncharacterized TRAP-family-like TSR-containing proteins, we found a protein with unknown function in the rodent model parasite <i>P. berghei</i> (PBANKA_0707900). Because of the presence of a single TSR as a sole detectable domain, we will refer to this protein as thrombospondin-related protein 1 (TRP1)."

                            {

                                "text": "The general domain composition of TRP1 shows many similarities to that\u00a0of\u00a0the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sultan et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Morahan et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The <i>TRP1</i> gene is intron-less, resides on chromosome 7 and encodes 896 amino acids. It can be found in all <i>Plasmodium</i> species and has a highly conserved core region that\u00a0includes\u00a0the TSR and the TMD (Figure 5A, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Both TRP1 and TRAP contain a signal peptide (SP), a TSR, a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However, TRP1 lacks the penultimate tryptophan (W) that has\u00a0been shown to be important for TRAP function (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kappe et al., 1999</a>) as well as the von Willebrandt factor like A-domain that is present at the N-terminus of TRAP and important for invasion (<a href=\"#bib44\">Matuschewski et al., 2002</a>). Nevertheless, not all of the TRAP-family proteins \u2014\u00a0CTRP, S6/TREP/UOS3, TLP and MTRAP \u2014\u00a0possess an A-domain, but they\u00a0are unified by the conserved C-terminal tryptophan residue (<a href=\"#bib47\">Morahan et al., 2009</a>). In comparison to that\u00a0of\u00a0TRAP, the N-terminal domain of TRP1 is less conserved and varies widely in length between different <i>Plasmodium</i> species (332 aa in <i>P. vivax</i>; 651\u00a0aa in <i>P. falciparum</i>) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). A similar observation was made for the CTD. Whereas\u00a0the\u00a0CTD domain of\u00a0TRP1\u00a0contains 19 amino acids in <i>P. falciparum</i>, it has a length of 97 amino acids in <i>P. knowlesi</i>. By contrast, the TSR of TRP1 is well conserved but has an unusual long insertion of 10 amino acids when\u00a0compared to TSRs from other apicomplexan proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Clusters of acidic amino acids at the C-terminus have\u00a0been shown to be important for TRAP function (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kappe et al., 1999</a>). However, the calculated isoelectric point\u00a0(pI) of the CTD of TRP1 varied widely between homologues from different <i>Plasmodium</i> species and indicated no enrichment for acidic amino acids (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Due to the overall similarity to TRAP-family proteins, we grouped TRP1 together with TRAMP (<a href=\"#bib68\">Thompson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Siddiqui et al., 2013</a>), TRSP (<a href=\"#bib41\">Labaied et al., 2007</a>) and SSP3 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Harupa et al., 2014</a>) in the family of TRAP-related proteins that have a potential cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) but lack the conserved tryptophan (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Homologues of TRP1 can be found in all <i>Plasmodium</i> species, but\u00a0we could not identify homologues in other apicomplexans. However, homology predictions are difficult because TRP1 lacks a unique feature that allows unambiguous identification of protein homologues. As many TSR-containing proteins in other apicomplexan parasites are still uncharacterized, we cannot exclude the\u00a0possibility\u00a0that functional homologues exist outside of\u00a0the genus <i>Plasmodium</i>."

Expression of mCherry in <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> parasites was only observed in budding and completely sporulated oocysts up to hemolymph sporozoites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To see if the lack of <i>trp1</i> affects the\u00a0development of oocysts, we counted the number of oocysts at different time points after infection of mosquitoes by <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> or the fluorescent control line <i>fluo</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Klug et al., 2016</a>), which expresses mCherry under control of the <i>CSP</i> promoter and GFP under control of the <i>ef1\u03b1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Oocyst numbers for the control decreased\u00a0between day 12 and day 22,\u00a0whereas\u00a0the number of oocysts in infected\u00a0<i>trp1(-)mCh</i>\u00a0mosquitoes remained stable. To screen for morphological differences between <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> and the control line, oocysts at day 12 and day 22 were also imaged and classified into oocysts containing mature or budding sporozoites (sporulated) and oocysts that didn\u2019t contain any sporozoite structures (unsporulated) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This imaging\u00a0showed that the percentage of <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> oocysts that had undergone or started sporogony (sporulated) was higher than the number of pre-mature (unsporulated) oocysts at both day 12 and day 22. While there was only a slight difference in this ratio between control and knockout on day 12, over 80% of the <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> oocysts were sporulated on day 22 compared with just\u00a045% in the control line. As no morphological difference between sporulated knockout and control oocysts could be observed (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>),\u00a0we assumed that <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> sporozoites are fully developed but not able to egress. To study the infectivity of sporozoites lacking TRP1, we performed transmission experiments using\u00a0either\u00a0bites by infected mosquitoes or intravenous injections of 400,000\u2013500,000 midgut sporozoites (Table 3, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2). These\u00a0experiments showed that mosquitoes infected with both knockout lines could not transmit the parasites to mice. However, we observed no difference in prepatencies between wild-type and <i>trp1(-)</i> parasites if midgut sporozoites were injected intravenously."

By contrast, mosquitoes\u00a0that\u00a0are infected with <i>trp1(-)</i> or <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> consistently showed high numbers of midgut sporozoites until 22 days post infection, while we observed only few sporozoites in the hemolymph and none in salivary glands (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To visualize this effect more clearly, we calculated the ratio of hemolymph sporozoites (HLS) to midgut sporozoites (MGS) and salivary gland sporozoites (SGS) to MGS. The ratio for SGS to MGS was zero for both <i>trp1(-)</i> lines, while the ratio for HLS to MGS was either zero (<i>trp1(-)</i>) or very low (<i>trp1(-)mCh</i>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). We also generated two <i>sera5(-)</i> strains (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) that were used as control for a non-egressing strain (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aly and Matuschewski, 2005</a>). Ratios of SGS to MGS and HLS to MGS for both strains gave similar results as for <i>trp1(-)</i> and <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). To investigate the cause of failure to egress, we performed motility assays of wild-type\u00a0and\u00a0<i>trp1(-)mCh</i> midgut and hemolymph sporozoites. Both wild-type and <i>trp1(-)</i> sporozoites derived from midguts were able to perform the typical circular gliding motility of sporozoites (<a href=\"#bib71\">Vanderberg, 1974</a>) but at very low rates (ca. 0.5\u20131% of the population) on day 15 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This fraction increased in hemolymph sporozoites to 10\u201320% of the population, and again,\u00a0no significant difference between <i>trp1(-)</i> and wild-type sporozoites was observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Interestingly the fraction of motile midgut sporozoites increased in the <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> line over time and reached a\u00a0level comparable to that of wild-type hemolymph sporozoites at day 22 post infection (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). By contrast, we observed\u00a0no difference in the percentage of moving midgut wild-type\u00a0sporozoites between day 15 and day 25\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure\u00a03D</a>).\u00a0"

This made it possible to recycle the selection marker in <i>trp1(-)</i> parasites to generate the marker-free line <i>trp1(-)rec</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We used this line for complementation approaches with full-length as well as N- and C-terminally truncated <i>trp1</i> mutants to further investigate the defects\u00a0in\u00a0oocyst egress and potential salivary gland invasion. The construct designed for complementation (<i>gfp-trp1comp</i>) contained the full-length <i>trp1</i> gene, whereas in the N-terminal deletion mutant (<i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i>), the sequence after the signal peptide until the start of the TSR (549 aa)\u00a0was removed. On the other hand, the C-terminal deletion mutant (<i>gfp-trp1\u2206C</i>) lacked the last 41 amino acids of the open reading frame, corresponding to the CTD (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). All generated constructs contained an N-terminal GFP placed in-between the signal sequence and the remaining ORF that allowed the visualization of the expression and localization of the fusion proteins. Transfections into <i>trp1(-)rec</i> gave rise to the three parasite lines <i>gfp-trp1comp</i>, <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> and <i>gfp-trp1\u2206C</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The full-length construct was additionally transfected into <i>wt</i> to generate the line <i>gfp-trp1</i>.

Despite similar numbers\u00a0of hemolymph sporozoites in <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> and <i>gfp-trp1\u2206C</i>, the ratio of HLS to MGS for <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> was more comparable to that\u00a0for\u00a0wild-type parasites,\u00a0while the ratio in <i>gfp-trp1\u2206C</i> was similar to that\u00a0in\u00a0<i>trp1(-)mCh</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). This suggests that <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> sporozoites are more capable of egressing from oocysts than <i>gfp-trp1\u2206C</i> sporozoites. By contrast, the ratio of SGS to MGS was zero for both <i>gfp-trp1\u2206C</i> and <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i>, indicating that the knockout phenotype is only partially restored in <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> parasites. The infectivity of <i>gfp-trp1comp</i>, <i>gfp-trp1</i>, <i>gfp-trp1\u2206C</i> and <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> was also tested by natural transmission experiments involving mosquito bites (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

These results matched the data for sporozoite numbers in the salivary glands that were zero for both mutants (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

We further constructed a parasite line in\u00a0which GFP was C-terminally fused to TRP1, termed <i>trp1-gfp</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This line showed no defect in sporozoite egress from oocysts but salivary glands contained consistently less sporozoites compared to wild-type (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Interestingly, we could only detect strong GFP fluorescence in the <i>trp1-gfp</i> line and weak GFP fluorescence in <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> parasites, while all other lines were non-fluorescent (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In contrast to <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> parasites, which express mCherry early during oocyst formation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), GFP expression in <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> parasites was only observed in oocysts with already matured sporozoites. This indicates that, beside the transcriptional regulation, TRP1 expression might also be post-transcriptionally regulated by the native 3\u2019UTR, which is not present in <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> parasites. To test whether\u00a0these lines transcribe the <i>gfp</i> and <i>trp1</i> genes as one transcript, we first performed RT-PCRs with cDNA generated from midgut sporozoites.\u00a0We were able to amplify a <i>gfp:trp1</i> transcript in <i>gfp-trp1comp</i>, <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> and <i>gfp-trp1\u2206C</i> sporozoites while no transcript could be detected in <i>wt</i>. In\u00a0addition, we performed two RT-PCRs for <i>trp1</i> transcripts, amplifying sequences encoding the TSR and the N-terminus. While the PCR amplifying the TSR sequence gave a product in all lines including <i>wt</i>, a product for the N-terminal PCR was only observed in <i>gfp-trp1comp,\u00a0gfp-trp1\u2206C</i> and <i>wt</i> parasites but, as expected, not in <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> parasites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Finally, we performed Western blotting, which revealed only\u00a0a short GFP-fusion protein as well as GFP for the C-terminally tagged full-length TRP1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). We could not detect full-length GFP-TRP1, suggesting that the protein is cleaved, and also failed to detect protein for the weakly GFP-expressing N-terminal deletion parasites."

By contrast, the GFP-fusion protein of the N-terminally deleted TRP1 did not show this localization and appeared to accumulate only within the sporozoites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Investigation of single sporozoites showed that the C-terminally tagged TRP1 localized at the periphery towards the rear end of the sporozoite, as well as within the sporozoite at the apical end (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). By contrast, the GFP signal in the <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> sporozoites localized to membranes within the parasite, presumably the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER)\u00a0as indicated by accumulations around the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A parasite line expressing cytoplasmic GFP was used as a control (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). By using anti-GFP antibodies in fixed sporozoites, we were not able to detect GFP-TRP1\u2206N on the sporozoite surface (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Comparison of the localizations of TRP1-GFP and GFP-TRAP (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kehrer et al., 2016b</a>) showed that the two proteins were localized differently (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). While GFP-TRAP appears mostly localized to micronemes at the front end of the sporozoite, TRP1-GFP appears to localize in what might be a subset of micronemes or a different organelle that does not extend all the way to the front. These data together indicate that TRP1 is transported through the ER, is post-translationally processed and can accumulate at the periphery of the parasite on its rear end."

                                "text": "Even if a low number of hemolymph sporozoites could be detected in the\u00a0<i>trp1(-)</i> and <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> knockout lines, the presented results indicate that the initial function of TRP1 lies in oocyst egress. To probe this in more detail, we established two new assays to image sporozoite egress from oocysts. These assays imaged extracted midguts placed either on microscope slides and pushed down by a coverslip or in a non-compacted setting in glass-bottom Petri-dishes (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>). Individual midguts were placed in insect medium (Grace\u2019s medium, GibcoTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and imaged either at high or low magnification for up to one hour. As expected, the frequency of egress events was low for both setups (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>). However, we were able to observe dozens of egress events. In one type of egress, mostly observed in the slide-coverslip setup, sporozoites were seen to be moving actively inside oocysts followed by egress from oocysts in a manner resembling the merosomes formed by late liver stages (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sturm et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Baer et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). We thus termed these vesicle-like deformations of the cyst wall sporosomes. From a total of over 800 imaged oocysts, we observed active sporozoite motility in 5\u20136% and egress-like events in about 3% of the wild-type oocysts. The same type of events with similar frequencies were also observed at the 2015 and 2016 <i>Biology of Parasitism</i> courses at Woods Hole using mosquitoes from two different insectaries. All egress-like events were preceded by sporozoite motility. By contrast, we observed no egress-like events in the <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> line and also no actively moving sporozoites within oocysts (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Although no egress could be observed in the knockout line, we were concerned\u00a0that\u00a0the pressure on the midguts induced by the overlaying cover slip might\u00a0force sporozoite egress. Therefore, we performed the same assay in glass-bottom Petri-dishes, in\u00a0which midguts were simply placed in medium with no lid. To this end, we used a fluorescent line (<i>fluo</i>) because imaging was performed with low magnification (10x) and egress events were only visible with fluorescence detection. In these experiments, we were able to observe motile sporozoites and their egress in the control at rates similar to those seen in the previous assay.\u00a0Furthermore,\u00a0we did not detect motility or egress in the TRP1 knockout (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media6\">6</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). In this assay,\u00a0we observed a variety of events like rapid bursting of oocysts, sporozoites budding from oocysts and sporozoites moving inside oocysts or their surrounding tissue (<a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media6\">6</a>). In parasites lacking the protease SERA5, we confirmed sporozoite motility within oocysts as described previously (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aly and Matuschewski, 2005</a>) and did also not witness any egress (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#media7\">Videos 7</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">8</a>). Intriguingly, <i>sera5(-)</i> parasites showed about four and eight times more oocysts with motile sporozoites than wild-type oocysts in both assays (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>), respectively. Considering that <i>sera5(-)</i> sporozoites do not exit oocysts, this further suggests that motility precedes egress."

The most striking was the apparent bursting of sporozoites and the apparent budding of sporozoites within vesicle-like deformations of the cyst wall that\u00a0we termed sporosomes (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">7</a>). We\u00a0imaged\u00a0547\u00a0control oocysts over a total of\u00a016 hr and observed egress events in about 3% of these oocysts, suggesting a rate of 0.5\u20131 egress events per hour. At this rate, 50% of oocysts in a medium infected midgut (~100 oocysts) would be emptied in 2\u20133 days. These numbers suggest that the observed events might well reflect those occurring in vivo. Naturally, in vivo observations would be desirable but intravital imaging in mosquitoes is challenging due to the opaque nature of the chitinous exoskeleton. This can be partially overcome by blood feeding mosquitoes just before imaging; this causes the abdomen to\u00a0inflate to such a degree that individual oocysts can be imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Yet, it is unclear whether a recent blood meal would influence egress. The application of fiber optic imaging could overcome this challenge (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sum and Ward, 2009</a>). In this methodology, a thin fiber is introduced into the mosquito and individual oocysts should be visible to the patient observer. However, the low rates of egress events would make imaging egress events in vivo a formidable challenge."

                                "text": "The observation of sporozoite budding into what appears to be membrane-delimited vesicles was both unexpected and curious, as the origin of the surrounding \u2018membrane\u2019 is not obvious. The plasma membrane of the ookinete develops into the plasma membrane of the developing oocyst,\u00a0which in turn forms the plasma membrane of the sporozoites (<a href=\"#bib70\">Vanderberg and Rhodin, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Thathy et al., 2002</a>). Hence, sporozoites differ\u00a0from\u00a0intracellular growing stages that are surrounded by a parasitophorous vacuole and a host cell plasma membrane: there should be no membrane around the formed sporozoites since they are only surrounded by the oocyst wall. Yet, the appearance of these sporosomes suggests that some form of delimiting \u2018membrane\u2019 is present. Earlier scanning EM images of infected midguts suggested that oocysts can bud off smaller cysts that were called satellites (<a href=\"#bib61\">Strome and Beaudoin, 1974</a>). It is not clear how satellite formation can occur or how it is initiated, but these observations suggest that the oocyst wall might be not completely rigid and could show some level of elasticity. Hence part of the delimiting \u2018membrane\u2019 of the sporosomes could be derived simply from the oocyst wall and thus not be a lipid membrane but a thin sheet of oocyst wall material, similar to that\u00a0which might surround sporozoites within satellites. As we only observed sporosome formation at midguts infected with wild-type parasites, it might well be that the oocyst wall is thinned by a succession of parasite-initiated proteolytic events, which\u00a0are not initiated in <i>trp1(-)</i> or <i>sera5(-)</i> parasites. These events likely destabilize the wall in a way that enables sporozoites to egress via rupture or budding. Yet, EM imaging of sporulated <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> and wild-type oocysts showed no differences in the appearance of the oocyst wall. Even 24 days post infection, <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> oocysts showed little difference in morphology and no difference in oocyst wall thickness when\u00a0compared to wild-type oocysts 12 days post infection (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These observations could suggest that proteolytic degradation of the oocyst wall is not affected in oocysts lacking TRP1. Alternatively, proteolytic degradation might happen only shortly before or during egress and is therefore hard to observe by electron microscopy\u00a0in wild-type oocysts. Clearly, in vivo imaging will be needed to confirm whether the different types of egress also\u00a0occur in living mosquitoes. Nevertheless, our assays will allow a more quantitative description of sporozoite egress from oocysts as already shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> with the comparison between <i>wt</i>, <i>trp1(-)</i> and <i>sera5(-)</i> parasites."

                                "text": "What role could TRP1 play during sporozoite egress from oocysts? Many TSR-containing proteins in <i>Plasmodium</i> have been studied and shown to have functions in gliding motility. The best example is TRAP, which is believed to interact with actin filaments below the plasma membrane to guide motility possibly by direct force transduction to the substrate. TRAP function is crucial as\u00a0sporozoites that\u00a0lack TRAP are not able to perform productive motility (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sultan et al., 1997</a>) and are probably, as a consequence, also unable to invade the salivary glands and infect the mammalian host. Other proteins of the TRAP-family were shown to have similar functions. CTRP, for example, fulfills the same role as TRAP but in ookinetes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dessens et al., 1999</a>), and S6/TREP-deficient sporozoites have\u00a0been shown to be less capable\u00a0of\u00a0gliding motility and invasion\u00a0of salivary glands (<a href=\"#bib60\">Steinbuechel and Matuschewski, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Combe et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, TRAP-related proteins that lack the penultimate tryptophan in the cytoplasmic tail domain were also\u00a0shown to support motility. The protein SSP3 is, for example, important for continuous movement of sporozoites (<a href=\"#bib29\">Harupa et al., 2014</a>). To accomplish these functions, TRAP-family proteins are localized at the plasma membrane. Therefore, it is likely that TRP1 is also\u00a0at least partially secreted to the parasite surface, where it could initiate signaling from the outside as has been speculated recently to be the case for sporozoite surface proteins (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kappe et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Quadt et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bane et al., 2016</a>). Indeed surface proteomics of sporozoites (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lindner et al., 2013</a>) showed that TRP1, even if just at low amounts, can be detected on the outside of the sporozoite plasma membrane. Once on the surface, TRP1 could lead, for example, to\u00a0sustained microneme secretion that would maintain or initiate gliding motility. Alternatively, it might play a role in motility by contributing to the disconnection of TRAP from actin filaments at the rear end, where the actin filament binding protein coronin was recently also\u00a0shown to be localized (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bane et al., 2016</a>). Although these functions remain highly speculative, in the absence of TRP1, there is no motility within oocysts and possibly reduced secretion. A\u00a0scenario involving TRP1 in signal transduction is not at odds with the observation that isolated <i>trp1(-)</i> sporozoites can glide, as other surface proteins can probably also transduce or modulate signals. Also it appears that many diverse ligands can activate sporozoites (<a href=\"#bib51\">Perschmann et al., 2011</a>). Beside the direct interaction with ligands that make contact with the sporozoite surface, TRP1 could also\u00a0assist in the correct trafficking and secretion of other proteins, as shown for MIC2 and the MIC2-associated protein (<a href=\"#bib32\">Huynh et al., 2003</a>)."

                                "text": "Clearly, the processes and factors that lead to parasite egress from host cells in general and egress of sporozoites from oocysts in particular are still poorly understood. The factors that are known to\u00a0date are the serine repeat antigen 5, SERA5 (previously named egress cysteine protease 1; ECP1), the GPI-anchored circumsporozoite protein, CSP (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aly and Matuschewski, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tewari et al., 2002</a>), the <i>Plasmodium</i> cysteine repeat modular proteins PCRMP3 and PCRMP4 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Douradinha et al., 2011</a>) and the LCCL-domain-containing proteins PfCCp2 and PfCCp3 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Pradel et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Sporozoites lacking SERA5, PCRMP3, PCRMP4, PfCCp2 and PfCCp3 fail to egress from oocysts (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aly and Matuschewski, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Douradinha et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pradel et al., 2004</a>), whereas\u00a0parasites lacking CSP do not complete sporozoite formation (<a href=\"#bib48\">M\u00e9nard et al., 1997</a>). The change of four basic amino acids into alanines within region II+ of CSP allowed normal sporozoite development but blocked egress from oocysts (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2005</a>). All six mutant parasites lines retained their capacity to migrate actively\u00a0once sporozoites were mechanically released from oocysts (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Another protein, the sporozoite invasion associated protein-1 (SIAP-1), possesses no recognizable structural or functional domains but has been identified as\u00a0having\u00a0a partial role in sporozoite egress. Parasites that\u00a0lack SIAP-1 have a strongly reduced rate of sporozoites egressing from oocysts but are still able to enter into salivary glands in low numbers (<a href=\"#bib24\">Engelmann et al., 2009</a>). In contrast to parasite lines that\u00a0lack the previously mentioned proteins (SERA5, PCRMP 3 and 4, PfCCp 2 and 3) or parasite lines that contain specific mutations within CSP, SIAP-1 knockout sporozoites also fail to undergo efficient gliding motility (<a href=\"#bib24\">Engelmann et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, the GPI-anchored micronemal antigen GAMA (previously named PSOP9) has been shown to be essential for egress from oocysts. Sporozoites that\u00a0lack GAMA are also not able to perform gliding motility in vitro and within oocysts ex vivo (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ecker et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, GAMA is expressed in all <i>Plasmodium</i> stages that contain micronemes and has\u00a0been discussed as a potential vaccine candidate against blood stages (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hinds et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Arumugam et al., 2011</a>). This ubiquitous expression profile makes it unlikely that GAMA has a specific function in sporozoite egress from oocysts but suggests that it is important for egress and invasion in general. Therefore the egress defect of <i>gama(-)</i> sporozoites presumably causes a defect within the micronemes that has more or less impact dependent on the observed parasite stage. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that <i>gama(-)</i> ookinetes produce 78% fewer oocysts than wild-type ookinetes,\u00a0indicating that the loss of GAMA has\u00a0an effect prior to oocyst development."

The intracellular pathway might require quorum sensing between the sporozoites of an oocyst that reponds to the presence or absence of a specific factor once sporulation is completed. This signal might be followed by secretion of micronemal and possibly exonemal proteins (e.g.\u00a0SERA5)\u00a0that induce both\u00a0sporozoite motility and\u00a0degradation of the oocyst wall. While continuous motility as well as inflow of extracellular factors might further enhance protein secretion, the oocyst envelope might become more and more fragile, leading eventually to sporozoite egress. The extracellular pathway might be initiated by the permeabilization of the oocyst wall, either by intracellular factors that are secreted after sporulation or by the breakdown of the oocyst wall that is not longer maintained once sporulation is completed. The inflow of extracellular factors might initiate the secretion process, which leads, as described for the intracellular pathway, to increased motility as well as breakdown of the oocyst wall and finally sporozoite egress. Independent of the pathway that triggers sporozoite egress, degradation of the oocyst wall is probably an interplay of multiple factors that do not lead to a uniform breakdown of the oocyst envelope but create focal weakenings that enable local release of sporozoites or budding of sporosomes (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>)."

Hence parasites that\u00a0lack proteins involved in both egress and motility are also impaired in salivary gland invasion and thus these proteins are essential for life cycle progression at two subsequent steps. In this context, TRP1 plays a unique role as it mediates egress but appears to have no role in gliding. Therefore, we assumed that sporozoites that\u00a0lack a functional TRP1 would enter into salivary glands. Interestingly, we could detect hemolymph sporozoites in low numbers, especially at later time points in mosquitoes highly infected with <i>trp1(-)mCh</i> parasites. We assume that in these mosquitoes, some of the oocysts released sporozoites, probably due to mechanical stress or oocyst wall degradation due to an arrest in oocyst wall formation. The numbers of hemolymph sporozoites were with a few hundred to a few thousand sporozoites, high enough to expect at least a few hundred sporozoites in the salivary glands. However, this was never observed."

These deficiencies can be explained differentially. The <i>gfp-trp1\u2206C</i> mutant lacks both the cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) and the putative micronemal targeting signal F/Y/WXX\u03a6 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Di Cristina et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bhanot et al., 2003</a>), which consists of an aromatic amino acid on position one and an hydrophobic amino acid (\u03a6) on position four. Micronemal proteins that lack this signal are directly targeted to the plasma membrane and secreted (<a href=\"#bib20\">Di Cristina et al., 2000</a>). However, we are not able to distinguish if this is also true for <i>gfp-trp1\u2206C</i> parasites because we could not observe any GFP expression in this line. Moreover, we cannot exclude the\u00a0possibility\u00a0that interactions with other proteins at the CTD are needed for TRP1 to be functional. Curiously, parasites\u00a0carrying\u00a0the full-length C-terminally tagged TRP1, albeit processed, showed no defect in their capacity to exit the oocysts, thus suggesting that an C-terminal GFP does not impair this TRP1 function. However, it did not completely complement salivary gland invasion (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). This suggests that the C-terminus might function differently in oocyst exit and salivary gland entry."

Although\u00a0<i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> sporozoites could not be detected in the salivary glands and were not transmitted by the\u00a0bites of infected mosquitoes, this line showed an egress rate that was only slightly decreased compared to wild-type. This suggests that the C-terminal part of the protein is required for sporozoite egress from oocysts, whereas both C- and N-terminus\u00a0are needed for salivary gland invasion. Interestingly, <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> was the only N-terminally tagged parasite line that was fluorescent, and the GFP-TRP1\u2206N fusion protein could be visualized in oocysts and free sporozoites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>). The tagged protein localized to membranes within the parasites, especially around the nucleus, which we believe is the location of the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). This indicates that TRP1 has a signal peptide and enters the secretory pathway similar to micronemal proteins. However, a distinct GFP signal could be observed\u00a0only in <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> parasites but not\u00a0in <i>gfp-trp1\u2206C</i>, <i>gfp-trp1comp</i> or <i>gfp-trp1</i> parasites. Interestingly, all of\u00a0these lines transcribe a <i>gfp:trp1</i> fusion transcript (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), indicating that transcription takes place as predicted. This\u00a0evidence,\u00a0together with the observation that the N-terminus of TRP1 clearly varies\u00a0in size and is less conserved between different <i>Plasmodium</i> species (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) and the\u00a0fact\u00a0that we observed only\u00a0a very small TRP1-GFP fusion protein by western blotting (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), suggests\u00a0that post-translational processing of TRP1 takes place at the N-terminal end, as shown for MIC5 and M2AP (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brydges et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Harper et al., 2006</a>), and probably also closer to the transmembrane domain. Therefore GFP might be cleaved off and rapidly degraded in <i>gfp-trp1\u2206C</i>, <i>gfp-trp1</i> and <i>gfp-trp1comp</i> parasites but not in <i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> parasites. Further mutants could be generated to investigate these possibilities and to\u00a0investigate putative cleavage site(s). The low band detected by western blotting might also suggest that the TSR domain is lost. Whether this loss is functionally required would also constitute an interesting avenue of future research."

In a second step, the 3' UTR (1,040 bp) was amplified with the primers P608 and P609 and cloned in the Pb262-PBANKA0707900-int vector downstream of the selection cassette to enable double crossover homologous recombination via both introduced sequences (5' and 3' UTR) and therefore exchange of the <i>trp1</i> open reading frame (ORF) with the selection cassette. The final vector Pb262-PBANKA0707900-KO was digested (<i>SalI</i> and <i>XhoI</i>), purified (High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit, Roche) and transfected into the <i>P. berghei</i> strain ANKA using standard protocols (<a href=\"#bib35\">Janse et al., 2006</a>). Subsequently, parasites that integrated the desired DNA fragment were selected by administration of pyrimethamine (0.07 mg/mL) in the drinking water. <i>trp1(-)</i> parasites were then cloned to generate isogenic populations and negatively selected using 5-fluorocytosine (1 mg/mL) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lin, 2011</a>) to give rise to <i>trp1(-)rec</i> parasites that lost the selection cassette (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). <i>trp1(-)rec</i> parasites were cloned and used for complementation approaches with <i>gfp-</i>tagged full-length (<i>gfp-trp1comp</i>) and N- and C-terminally (<i>gfp-trp1\u2206N</i> and <i>gfp-trp1\u2206C</i>) truncated <i>trp1</i> constructs ( <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The <i>gfp</i>-tagged full-length <i>trp1</i> construct was also transfected into the <i>P. berghei</i> ANKA strain to generate the parasite line <i>gfp-trp1</i>, which is genetically identical to <i>gfp-trp1comp</i>. In addition to <i>trp1(-)</i>,\u00a0a second knockout line was generated to track promoter activity of <i>trp1</i> in vivo as follows. To generate the promoter-reporter construct, the 5'UTR of <i>trp1</i> was amplified with the primers P606 and P887 (858 bp). The construct is based on the Pb262 vector that used the same selection cassette as before but which\u00a0also\u00a0contained the <i>mCherry</i> gene followed by a <i>dhfs</i> terminator. The generated 5' UTR was cloned via <i>SalI</i> and <i>NdeI</i> directly in front of the <i>mCherry</i> gene to enable transcription in vivo upon <i>trp1</i> promoter activation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The 3'UTR was amplified and cloned as described above to enable double crossover homologous recombination. The final vector was transfected into the <i>P. berghei</i> ANKA strain as described above. Note that the distance between the <i>trp1</i> ORF and its neighboring downstream\u00a0gene (PBANKA_0708000; SEC23)\u00a0amounts to just 291 bp. To avoid an influence in transcription of PBANKA_0708000 but ensure efficient recombination, we decided to leave a part of the <i>trp1</i> coding sequence attached to the 3' UTR. Therefore, all generated knockout lines described in this study still contain 609 bp of the <i>trp1</i> ORF but will be referred to as <i>trp1</i> knockout."

We used the Pb238 vector (<a href=\"#bib17\">Deligianni et al., 2011</a>) as template for all three complementation constructs. The vector contains the positive selection marker human <i>dhfr</i> controlled by the <i>ef1\u03b1</i> promoter and a <i>dhfr</i> terminator from <i>P. berghei</i>, as well as a <i>gfp</i> upstream of the selection cassette. The 5'UTR, which\u00a0included the sequence encoding the signal peptide of <i>trp1</i> (989 bp), was amplified with the primers P610 and P611 and fused (by\u00a0<i>SacII</i> and <i>PshAI</i>) with the <i>gfp</i> gene to tag <i>trp1</i> N-terminally. In a next step, the 3'UTR of <i>trp1</i> was amplified with the primers P608/P609 and cloned downstream of the selection cassette to enable integration by double crossover homologous recombination. This vector was named Pb238-PBANKA0707900-int. To generate the vector for complementation with full-length <i>trp1</i>, the coding sequence beginning after the signal peptide and the 3'UTR of <i>trp1</i> (3,643 bp) were amplified with the primers P612 and P616. The PCR product was subcloned in the pGEM-T-Easy vector (pGEM-TRP1complete) and fully sequenced. Afterwards, the sequence was cloned (using\u00a0<i>KasI</i> and <i>BamHI</i>) in the Pb238-PBANKA0707900-int vector downstream of the <i>gfp</i> gene to generate the final construct for complementation. To create truncated mutants, the N- and C-terminus in the pGEM-TRP1complete vector was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis with the primers P694/P695 (C-terminus) and P698/P699 (N-terminus). The PCR products were cloned into the Pb238-PBANKA0707900-int vector as described before. To tag TRP1 C-terminally with GFP, the C-terminal end (1,030 bp) of the <i>trp1</i> gene was amplified with the primers P1562 and P1597. The Pb238-PBANKA0707900-int vector was digested with <i>SacII</i> and <i>NdeI</i> to ligate the previously amplified PCR product in front of the <i>gfp</i> and to\u00a0generate a fusion between both genes. All N-terminally tagged constructs were digested (by\u00a0<i>SacII</i> and <i>XhoI</i>), purified (High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit, Roche) and transfected into <i>trp1(-)rec</i> parasites using standard protocols. The C-terminally tagged construct was digested and purified in the same way but was transfected into <i>wt</i> parasites. Subsequently, parasites that integrated the desired DNA fragment were selected via pyrimethamine as described above."

Membranes were subsequently blocked (PBS containing 0.05% Tween20 and 5% milk powder) and incubated for 1 hr with antibodies directed against GFP (mouse monoclonal antibody, clones 7.1 and 13.1, Roche, 1:1,000 diluted) or CSP (anti-CSP mAb 3D11 (<a href=\"#bib77\">Yoshida et al., 1980</a>), cell culture supernatant 1:50 diluted). Membranes were washed three times (PBS with 0.05% Tween20) and secondary anti-mouse antibodies (NXA931, GE Healthcare) conjugated to horse peroxidase were applied subsequently for 1 hr (1:10,000 dilution). Prior to incubation with antibodies against CSP,\u00a0which\u00a0was used as a\u00a0loading control, blots were treated with mild stripping buffer according to abcam protocols. Signals were detected using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate or SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Themo Fisher Scientific)."

The results are based on the analysis of two different knockouts lines along with extensive characterization of sporozoite development, motility, ability to reach salivary glands, and mouse infectivity. The findings suggest that Trp1 is required for motility within oocysts as a prelude to egress and that sporozoites egress from oocysts by several different styles, including release of free sporozoites from a defined point(s) or release of encased sporozoites as a group. Although for the most part the work is thorough and the experiments well executed, there are substantial concerns expressed by the reviewers and these include additional data, expansion of the Discussion as well as some degree of toning down the importance of some aspects of the findings."

We changed \u201cstructures\u201d into \u201cvesicle-like deformations of the cyst wall\u201d (subsection \u201cSynchronous activation of mature sporozoites is crucial for effective egress from oocysts\u201d and subsection \u201cVisualizing sporozoite egress: Bursting and budding within vesicle-like structures\u201d, first paragraph), which is indeed a clearer message. In order to investigate the localization of TRP1 more precisely (and also to understand the processing of the protein better \u2013 see below) we generated a new parasite line that expresses a C-terminally GFP-tagged TRP1. Although this did not allow us to investigate directly the surface (the GFP-tag is presumably on the insight of the plasma membrane), we could reveal an intriguing polarized localization to the periphery (likely surface). TRP1 is localized mostly at the rear end of the parasite. Interestingly, another protein with such a clear polarized localization to the rear is the actin filament binding protein coronin (recently published by us in Plos Pathogens). Sporozoites lacking coronin have a problem with gliding motility and salivary gland invasion. As <i>trp1(-)</i> sporozoites also fail to enter into salivary glands, these proteins might somehow act in a similar way. We added the new data for TRP1-GFP into <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig8\">8</a> and the accompanying text in the Results (subsection \u201cTRP1 is post-translationally processed\u201d) and Discussion (subsection \u201cTRP1 is likely trafficked through the ER\u201d, second and third paragraphs). As to immuno EM we don\u2019t hold the technique to high in esteem for sporozoites for various reasons, mostly because in our view it only has produced nice results for highly expressed proteins (e.g. CSP and TRAP), but TRP1 is clearly not among them. Nevertheless, we tried already early on to raise antibodies against TRP1 but failed in two attempts to get an antibody that was specific enough in Western blotting to be used in either immunofluorescence or EM analysis (see <a href=\"#fig11\">Author response image 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig12\">Author response image 2</a>). As the N-terminally tagged GFP is cleaved from the protein, we could not use an anti-GFP antibody to probe surface location as we initially hoped. The questions on where TRP1 is cleaved and by which enzyme clearly requires future research. Our also added data on <i>sera5(-)</i> parasites suggest that it is not this protease that processes TRP1 (see below)."

In sporozoites TRP1-GFP localized in a polarized fashion at the periphery, probably to the plasma membrane.

Nevertheless, we think that the new data, together with recently published proteomics data (Lindner et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 2013) are a strong hint that TRP1 is a surface protein that could be involved in signaling processes. We also compared TRP1-GFP localization with that of GFP-TRAP, which revealed a distinct localization, although the signals partly overlap in the apical part, suggesting that TRP1 might be localized in a subset of micronemes or a different set of secretory vesicles."

This revealed a distinct localization, although the signals partly overlap in the apical part, suggesting that TRP1 might be localized in a subset of micronemes or a different set of vesicles. Subsets of micronemes have indeed been found in <i>T. gondii</i> tachyzoites, which are much larger and hence amenable to super-resolution imaging (Kremer et al., Plos Path 2013). We also applied two different super-resolution imaging techniques on sporozoites with both Prof. Christoph Cremer (GSDM) and Prof. Stefan Hell (STED), but both did not allow us to distinguish between two neighboring micronemes. We currently aim at establishing proximity biotinylation methods for sporozoites, which will ultimately be helpful of biochemically distinguishing such populations. However, currently we only had success with gametocystes (Kehrer et al., Mol Cell Proteom 2016) and ookinetes (unpublished) but with sporozoites we still struggle with the amount of collected protein needed for analysis by mass spectrometry."

Ex. Med. 2005). Importantly we quantified this effect and found about 4-8 times as many oocysts that show intra-oocyst motility compared with <i>wt</i> parasites, depending on the assay used (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). This striking finding suggests strongly that movement precedes motility as now stated at the end of the Results section."

Expanding this part would in our view distract from the main flow of the Discussion and decrease readability. We hope that the reviewers will recognize that our paper includes several different transgenic lines and establishes new assay systems that allow (with the inclusion of the <i>sera5(-)</i> parasites) a quantitative comparison of sporozoite egress from oocysts for the first time. This leads for the first time to a suggestion of a cascade of events that might mediate sporozoite egress.
