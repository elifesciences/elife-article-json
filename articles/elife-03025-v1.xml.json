It remains unknown how pheromone information interacts to trigger innate behaviors. In this study, we identify vomeronasal receptors responsible for detecting female pheromones. A sub-group of V1re clade members recognizes gender-identifying cues in female urine. Multiple members of the V1rj clade are cognate receptors for urinary estrus signals, as well as for sulfated estrogen (SE) compounds. In both cases, the same cue activates multiple homologous receptors, suggesting redundancy in encoding female pheromone cues. Neither gender-specific cues nor SEs alone are sufficient to promote courtship behavior in male mice, whereas robust courtship behavior can be induced when the two cues are applied together. Thus, integrated action of different female cues is required in pheromone-triggered mating behavior. These results suggest a gating mechanism in the vomeronasal circuit in promoting specific innate behavior."

It remains unknown how pheromone information interacts to trigger innate behaviors. In this study, we identify vomeronasal receptors responsible for detecting female pheromones. A sub-group of V1re clade members recognizes gender-identifying cues in female urine. Multiple members of the V1rj clade are cognate receptors for urinary estrus signals, as well as for sulfated estrogen (SE) compounds. In both cases, the same cue activates multiple homologous receptors, suggesting redundancy in encoding female pheromone cues. Neither gender-specific cues nor SEs alone are sufficient to promote courtship behavior in male mice, whereas robust courtship behavior can be induced when the two cues are applied together. Thus, integrated action of different female cues is required in pheromone-triggered mating behavior. These results suggest a gating mechanism in the vomeronasal circuit in promoting specific innate behavior."

Two previously unknown pheromone-receptor pairs were found. One helps male mice detect when a female is present, while the other lets him know if she is ready to mate. Together these two chemicals alert a male mouse to a potential mate and cause him to mount her in order to mate. However, neither chemical is able to trigger this male courtship behavior on its own."

Sexually mature animals respond to pheromone signals from potential mates with endocrine changes and ritualistic action patterns (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wyatt, 2003</a>). In spite of their innate nature, reproductive behaviors are not simple reflexes. They are complex neural processes that are modulated not only by the reproductive status of the animal (e.g., hormonal states, social ranks and past experiences), but also the status of potential mates and environmental factors such as the presence of predators (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tinbergen, 1951</a>).

The vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) encode information about gender, reproductive status, genetic background and individual differences of animals of the same species, as well as that of heterospecifics (<a href=\"#bib16\">Halem et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Holy et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Boschat et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wyatt, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kimoto et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chamero et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kimoto et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Haga et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Papes et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Isogai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tolokh et al., 2013</a>). The multitude of cues potentially provides snapshots of other animals and surrounding environments to influence reproductive behaviors. To date, our understanding of the neural logic that controls these innate behaviors remains limited. It has been shown that individual pheromones can directly trigger distinct innate behaviors. For example, the male-specific exocrine peptide ESP1 induces lordosis in female mice, a stereotypic gesture characterized by the arching of the back with raised rear, to signal receptivity to potential mates (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kimoto et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Haga et al., 2010</a>). ESP1 induces lordosis through its receptor V2Rp5 (Vmn2r116), a member of the V2r family (<a href=\"#bib15\">Haga et al., 2010</a>). In this case, the circuit that connects receptor-expressing neurons to brain centers appears to be a labeled line\u2014the activation of a single receptor and its downstream neurons is sufficient to trigger lordosis, and removing the V2Rp5 receptor abolishes both the ESP1-evoked neural activation in the brain and the behavioral output of ESP1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Haga et al., 2010</a>)."

In contrast to the myriad sensory cues that induce behavioral responses and the large number of putative receptors, there is a limited repertoire of highly stereotyped behavioral outputs resulting from VNO activation. In genetic and surgical disruptions of VNO function that lead to the alterations of innate behaviors, it is often observed that the onset and frequency of specific behaviors, but not the behavioral patterns per se, are altered. This revelation indicates that the signals processed by distinct VR circuits are likely integrated in brain networks to induce a behavior selected from a fixed set of behavioral patterns. Thus, the neural circuits that process pheromone information must have an intrinsic logic in integrating external and internal signals to produce coordinated behaviors in order to maximize reproductive fitness. This logic has not been clearly illustrated. Given that only a few receptors among the more than 300 members of the vomeronasal receptor families have been paired with ligands and assigned with functions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Boschat et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shi and Zhang, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Young and Trask, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Haga et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Liberles, 2014</a>), identification of receptors responding to specific pheromone signals should provide us with insights into the logic of information processing in the vomeronasal system."

In particular, the receptors conveying sex information remain elusive. We seek to identify VRs that convey information about sex and reproductive status of the female mice. In a previous study, we developed transgenic mice expressing the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor GCaMP2 in the VNO neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2008</a>). By profiling the calcium response of individual VNO neurons in slice preparations, we were able to identify neurons that respond to gender- or estrus-specific urinary stimuli (<a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2008</a>). These cells likely convey information regarding gender identity and reproductive status of the emitter. In this study, we combine this approach with single-cell degenerate reverse transcription-PCR to clone receptor genes from neurons with specific response profiles. This novel approach allows us to identify vomeronasal receptors that detect specific signals whether or not the ligands are known. The identification of the receptors facilitated the purification of a urinary fraction that activates those receptors. The urinary signals act synergistically to induce robust mounting behavior in male mice. Our study suggests two distinct operating principles in pheromone-triggered mating behaviors."

In a previous study, we identified two populations of vomeronasal sensory neurons that respond to gender and estrus status cues from female mouse urine, respectively (<a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2008</a>). To examine whether these cues communicate sexual receptivity to males, we painted ovariectomized females, which are not influenced by endogenous hormonal and pheromonal fluctuations, with female mouse urine collected during the estrus phase (estrus urine, or EU; \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) or non-estrus phase (non-estrus urine, or NEU), and exposed them to sexually na\u00efve males.

In contrast, cues that activate the female urine specific cells (FUSCs) are present regardless of genetic background or estrus status of the donors (<a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2008</a>). Activation of FUSCs may convey female specific gender-identifying information. To identify VRs expressed in FUSCs, we profiled VSN response to multiple urine samples from either sex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), and isolated 10 candidates for degenerate RT-PCR analysis. 7 out of the 10 FUSCs were found to express receptors belonging to the V1re clade (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

Despite their sequence similarity, none of V1re members located on Chr.17 was found in the FUSCs, whereas 5 out of 7 V1re-Chr.7 receptors were cloned from these cells.

When urine samples from males and females of several strains were applied to slices prepared from mice carrying all four alleles, tdTomato-expressing cells were activated by all of the female but not the male samples (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Importantly, tdTomato-expressing cells were activated by the urine of females regardless of their estrous conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Urine from ovariectomized females can also activate V1re9 and V1re12-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). However, urine from ovariectomized females was less potent in activating these neurons, especially the V1re9-expressing cells. These observations suggested that the expression of female-specific gender cue(s) was likely regulated by the ovaries. Taken together, these results demonstrate that V1re-Chr.7 receptors are activated by gender-specific cues from females."

The amount of putative pheromones in urine is likely to be very small, making it difficult to identify them. Taking advantage of the VNOs ectopically expressing V1re9 and V1re12, we performed imaging experiments to screen for urinary fractions that activate these receptors. We first identified urine fractions that retained VNO-stimulating activities (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and subsequently screened high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractions separated using a C18 column with methanol gradient (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). One of the fractions, T16 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), strongly activated the V1re9 and V1re12 cells but not the V1rj2 or V1rj3 neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>), suggesting that T16 contains the female gender-specific cue(s)."

Interestingly, however, supplementing NEU with SEs induced more robust mounting (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that additional cues besides the SEs were needed to elicit mounting behavior in males. The additional cue is likely female-specific and is present in both NEU and EU, making T16 fraction a good candidate for such a cue. Indeed, mixing T16 fraction with SEs induced mounting activities as robust as that induced by EU (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), whereas painting T16 fraction alone did not elicit increased mounting by males (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>).

Consequently, the majority of the vomeronasal receptors have not been characterized, nor have they been assigned with specific functions. In insect species, pheromones have traditionally been first identified through behavioral assays (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wyatt, 2003</a>). The identification of specific receptors for the pheromones usually follows. The pairing of pheromones and their cognate receptors then leads to the characterization of the specific neural circuits involved in pheromone communication (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dahanukar and Ray, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gomez-Diaz and Benton, 2013</a>). In mammals, chemical purification studies have revealed a number of urinary chemicals as putative pheromones (<a href=\"#bib38\">Novotny et al., 1985</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jemiolo et al., 1989</a>). However, few compounds are able to elicit behavioral or physiological responses by themselves. Moreover, some recent studies have raised doubts about the effects of some of these compounds as pheromones (<a href=\"#bib12\">Flanagan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Brechbuhl et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Osada et al., 2013</a>).

Adopting a transgenic approach not only eliminates the difficulty in establishing a robust heterologous assay system for each receptor, but also allows the analysis of receptor function in their native environment (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zhao et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Nguyen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Haga et al., 2010</a>). By taking advantage of the tetracycline-inducible system in transgenic mice, we ectopically expressed the identified V1r genes in the VNO to characterize their response properties. Moreover, the transgenic mice expressing the V1rs also enabled us to fractionate and partially purify their natural ligands. The physiological importance of these semi-purified ligands was confirmed by subsequent behavioral assays."

A similar approach has recently been established by using immediate early genes (IEGs) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Isogai et al., 2011</a>). Double staining of IEGs and receptor genes by in situ hybridization allowed the categorization of receptor groups based on their putative functions. However, conventional in situ hybridization techniques do not provide a clear distinction among highly homologous genes such as members of a given receptor clade. Moreover, in situ IEG staining is less sensitive than calcium imaging for measuring neuronal activation. These limitations can be overcome by using our current methodology."

Consistent with this, we found that the sulfated estrogen compounds activate the VSNs at sub-nanomolar concentrations: neurons can be activated by 100 pM concentrations of E1103 or E1050. Importantly, the same sensitivity was recapitulated by the ectopically expressed V1rj2 and V1rj3 receptors. The V1rj receptors are not only sensitive to sulfated steroids, but they are also highly selective. Except one sulfated androgen, none of the sulfated steroids other than estrogens activated the V1rj2 and V1rj3 receptors. On the other hand, although the V1rj2 and V1rj3 receptors are specifically activated by the sulfated estrogens, they tolerate some structural variation of the sulfated estrogens. The bisulfated estrogen, E1050, and the monosulfated estrogen, E1103, activated the V1rj receptors with comparable efficacy. These observations indicate that V1r receptors can discriminate distinct structural classes of steroids, while accepting minor structural variations within the class."

This suggests that receptors that recognize a given female cue are closely related family members belonging to the same clade of the V1r family. Moreover, the members of each receptor group are clustered in the same chromosomal loci. The V1rj members are located in close proximity to each other on Chr.7 in a stretch of \u223c150 kb DNA. The receptors identified from FUSCs are V1re clade members also clustered on Chr.7. The V1re clade members located on Chr.17 were not identified from any of the FUSCs, despite their sequence similarity to those located on Chr.7. Although it is not clear whether the V1re-Chr.17 receptors also respond to female-specific gender cues, the evidence so far suggests a tight association between the chromosomal location of the receptor genes and their ligand recognition specificity. Thus, it is likely that the pools of receptor genes have been expanded locally in the genome to enable the redundant recognition of estrus or gender specific signals. This expansion may also diversify the response properties of the receptor pools. V1rj3 appears to be narrowly tuned to sulfated estrogens and is more sensitive to E1103. V1rj2, on the other hand, is more sensitive to E1050. In addition, it can be activated by additional sulfated steroid compounds. These diversified response properties may allow the fine tuning of behavioral response."

Building a redundancy in pheromone recognition would enable robust detection of important cues. Both the estrus and the female-specific gender cues are recognized by multiple receptors, and both are required to trigger male mounting behaviors. Since male mounting behavior is an essential component of male reproductive behavior, redundant coding of these signals may be advantageous to reproductive success. In addition, activation of multiple receptors by a given ligand may offer an advantage in detecting a broader range of ligand concentrations. Indeed, in the present study, the SEs showed different threshold concentrations in activating V1rj2 and V1rj3. Such diversity should enable the VNO to detect the threshold concentration of the ligand with the most sensitive receptor, as well as to accommodate high concentrations of the ligand that can fully activate several receptors. In this scenario, redundancy offers an advantage in expanding the dynamic range of pheromone detection and providing quantitative information of a given pheromone ligand."

Individual pheromones can directly trigger distinct innate behaviors, but complex interactions of pheromones in eliciting behaviors are observed in vertebrate species (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wyatt, 2003</a>). Our observations suggest a model of neural circuitry that processes complex pheromone cues. In this model, activation of both the V1rj and V1re-Chr.7 receptor circuits promotes mating behavior in male mice. This requirement of two sets of pheromone cues suggests an \u2018AND\u2019 gate in circuit logic, which can provide safeguard against spurious signals. The gender cue is not sufficient to induce mounting behavior unless the estrus signal is also present. This mechanism may enhance reproductive success by inducing males to mate preferentially with estrous females. Likewise, the activation of the V1rj receptors alone is not sufficient to induce mounting behaviors. Estrogen metabolites, including sulfated estrogens, may be excreted by animals of other species. Responding to these compounds alone may induce an inappropriate behavioral response to false targets. It is conceivable that only when both estrus signals and gender specific signals from their own species are present, the mating circuit is activated. On the other hand, the observation that several receptors recognize the same set of female pheromone cues suggests that the receptors may serve a redundant function in encoding pheromone information, which resembles an \u2018OR\u2019 gate in circuit logic.

One potential site is the connection between the VSN axon terminals and dendrites of mitral cells within the glomeruli in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), the primary relay center in the vomeronasal system. It has been shown that VSN axons expressing homologous receptors intermingle within spatially conserved domains of the AOB (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wagner et al., 2006</a>), providing a potential integration site for \u2018OR\u2019 gated signals. The AOB secondary neurons, mitral cells, arborize multiple dendrites onto different glomeruli (<a href=\"#bib48\">Takami and Graziadei, 1991</a>), providing an anatomical structure for a potential integration site of \u2018AND\u2019 gated signals. This scenario fits to the hierarchical integration model (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), where the female or estrus signals received by multiple members of V1re or V1rj receptors reach the \u2018OR\u2019 gates for each receptor group, and then the signals passing through the gates are integrated again at the \u2018AND\u2019 gate. Alternatively, it is also possible that the female signals received by any of V1re receptors are integrated with the estrus signals received by any of V1rj receptors at the multiple nodes of the \u2018AND\u2019 gates. The signals that passed through each \u2018AND\u2019 gate are integrated again at the \u2018OR\u2019 gate (multiple node integration model, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>).

By again using V1 (dT)<sub>24</sub> and V3 (dT)<sub>24</sub> primers, the double-stranded cDNAs were then amplified by 20-cycle-PCR. V1r or V2r genes were amplified by 17 V1r and 7 V2r degenerate PCR primers (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Each primer pair was examined for the coverage of members of each receptor group by performing RT-PCR analysis by using either pooled VNO mRNA samples or single cell samples (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T vector followed by sequence analysis. The sequence annotation was conducted by using the custom-made program with the custom-made receptor database containing all identified VRs."

The females were painted with one of the following stimuli: vehicle (PBS), estrus or non-estrus urine, 10 \u03bcM sulfated estrogens (E1050, E1103) in vehicle or in none-estrus urine, HPLC fraction in vehicle or with 10 \u03bcM sulfated estrogens. The stimuli were painted on the anogenital area and dried for 10 min before the females were introduced to male home cages. All assays were conducted in the dark cycle of the animals and video-taped. To minimize the influence of behavioral differences of the recipient females, each female was randomly assigned to each of the stimuli and used multiple times with at least 2 weeks of interval. For aggression assay, individual males were singly housed for 2\u20133 weeks. During the test, a group-housed CBA male was introduced to the home cage of the resident male."

Using a technically difficult combination of slice calcium imaging and single-cell RT-PCR, the authors identified two subtypes of VRs, V1rjs that respond to sulfated estrogen products (found only in urine from females in estrous) and V1res that respond to a specific fraction of female urine (T16). Using transgenic ectopic overexpression the authors demonstrate that ectopic expression of these receptors confers responsiveness to VNO neurons that normally do not express these receptors, supporting their hypothesis that these are the cognate receptors for these ligands."

Have the authors checked if any of the V1R overexpressing males show normal mounting behavior? It would be interesting to see how the transgenic mice that express V1rj and V1re in most cells of the VNO respond behaviorally to total female urine or SE and T16.

That said, in odorant receptor M71 overexpressing mice, the mice show impaired detection of the M71 ligand acetophenone. Have the authors checked if any of the V1R overexpressing males show normal mounting behavior? It would be interesting to see how the transgenic mice that express V1rj and V1re in most cells of the VNO respond behaviorally to total female urine or SE and T16. Given that these receptors are now expressed in VNO neurons involved in other functions (for example aggression) one would expect that these mice might show some other behavioral alterations</i>."

The interpretation of this result, however, is complicated by many factors. The expression of ectopic receptor may displace the endogenous receptor genes to effect a general reduction of VNO function. Alternatively, it is possible that suppressed expression of VRs responding the male cues selectively reduces male aggression. Further complicating the interpretation is that the main olfactory system may be compromised as well. Similar to the ectopic expression of M71 receptor in the monoclonal nose mice, our transgenes are also driven by OMP, which allows the expression of VRs in the main olfactory epithelium. A systematic investigation of different lines will be required to address the questions being raised."
