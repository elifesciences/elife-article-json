Yet, how circuits in these parallel pathways are composed to maintain or even enhance the encoding of specific stimulus features is poorly understood. Here, we have investigated the parallel pathways formed by mitral and tufted cells of the olfactory system in mice and characterized the emergence of feature selectivity in these cell types via distinct lateral inhibitory circuits. We find differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition between mitral and tufted cells that likely reflect newly described differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations show that these circuit-level differences allow mitral and tufted cells to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways."

Yet, how circuits in these parallel pathways are composed to maintain or even enhance the encoding of specific stimulus features is poorly understood. Here, we have investigated the parallel pathways formed by mitral and tufted cells of the olfactory system in mice and characterized the emergence of feature selectivity in these cell types via distinct lateral inhibitory circuits. We find differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition between mitral and tufted cells that likely reflect newly described differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations show that these circuit-level differences allow mitral and tufted cells to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways."

For example, when seeing an object, information about colour and movement are processed by separate types of neurons in the eye. These neurons in turn relay information to different sets of brain areas, all of which are active at the same time. Such parallel processing was originally not thought to apply to information about smell. This was because in mammals, the two types of neurons in the brain area that processes smell seemed to play the same role. However, more recent work suggests that there are in fact differences in the responses of these two neuron types (called mitral cells and tufted cells) to odors, suggesting that the brain might use parallel processing for information about smells too."

This is important for enhancing contrast; in terms of the sense of smell, lateral inhibition is thought to help distinguish between similar odors."

This revealed that lateral inhibition affects mitral cells only when they are spiking at intermediate firing rates, whereas tufted cells are only affected by lateral inhibition when spiking at low firing rates. Using computer simulations, Geramita et al. show that these different responses mean that mitral cells are best at distinguishing similar smells when they are present at high concentrations, while tufted cells are best at distinguishing similar smells that are present at low concentrations. These differences also mean that, by working together, mitral and tufted cells can distinguish between smells much better than either type of neuron on its own."

While MCs are affected by lateral inhibition at intermediate firing rates (~50\u2009Hz), TCs are affected when firing at low firing rates (&lt;25Hz). This difference arises, in part, due to differential recruitment of morphologically distinct classes of GCs by MCs and TCs. Finally, we use simulations to explore how these circuit-level differences between MCs and TCs influence odor discrimination. Specifically, the combination of activity-dependent lateral inhibition at both low and intermediate rates enables TCs and MCs to collectively encode odors better than either population alone and supports novel computations that are unlikely to occur with a single neuron type."

To examine early and late components of the inhibitory responses onto MCs and TCs, we separated early (&lt;250 ms after stimulation) and late (&gt;250 ms after photostimulation) components of the inhibitory currents. The peak amplitude of early inhibition was larger in MCs than in TCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>), while the charge transferred of early phase inhibition was not significantly different (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>).

Our finding that inhibition is largely unaffected by apical dendrite truncation suggests that differences in ADLI between MCs and TCs most likely involves inhibitory circuitry within the external plexiform layer (EPL). Consistent with MCs and TCs engaging distinct lateral inhibitory circuits within the EPL, classical morphological studies suggest that GCs are subdivided into superficial GCs (sGCs), which innervate the superficial EPL, and deep GCs (dGCs), which innervate the deep EPL\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib46\">Mori et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Orona et al., 1983</a>). This putative morphological subdivision of GCs suggests that sGCs inhibit TC lateral dendrites in the superficial EPL while dGCs inhibit MC lateral dendrites in the deep EPL\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib46\">Mori et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Orona et al., 1984</a>). Therefore, functional differences between sGCs and dGCs may mechanistically underlie the difference in ADLI observed between MCs and TCs. In particular, given our prior results demonstrating that low firing rates in MCs are unaffected by lateral inhibition because many GCs require cooperative inputs from multiple glomeruli in order to be activated\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Arevian et al., 2008</a>), we hypothesized that low firing rates in TCs are affected by lateral inhibition because sGCs are more strongly recruited than dGCs following activation of a single glomerulus."

Specifically, GCs located in the MCL and upper GCL tend to exhibit sGC morphologies and suprathreshold odor responses while GCs located in the lower GCL tend to exhibit dGC morphologies and subthreshold odor responses (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mori et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Orona et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wellis and Scott, 1990</a>). Whether these differences in odor-evoked activity in vivo\u00a0reflect functional differences between GC subtypes and M/TC connectivity remains unclear, however, as: 1) odors activate multiple glomeruli in distinct spatiotemporal patterns, which can evoke a complex array of convergent excitation and inhibition onto individual GCs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Burton and Urban, 2015</a>), and 2) GC activity in vivo\u00a0is strongly influenced by centrifugal input (<a href=\"#bib6\">Balu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Boyd et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Markopoulos et al., 2012</a>) and anesthesia (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kato et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cazakoff et al., 2014</a>)."

Indeed, reconstruction and visual classification of a large subset of recorded GCs and analysis of the spatial distribution of gemmules \u2013 the site of reciprocal dendrodendritic synapse formation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib57\">Rall et al., 1966</a>) \u2013 confirmed that sGCs preferentially innervate the superficial EPL while dGCs preferentially innervate the deep EPL (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g</a>). Moreover, somatic depth significantly \u2013 but incompletely \u2013 predicted GC subtype (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a,d</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>, Table 1), as previously observed\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib46\">Mori et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Orona et al., 1983</a>). To determine whether the observed morphological differences reflect subtypes of GCs rather than a continuum, we additionally performed unbiased clustering of GCs. Specifically, clustering of GCs by the Euclidean distances among their normalized gemmule distributions (using Ward\u2019s method) and application of the gap statistic method yielded 3 distinct clusters: dGCs, sGCs, and a small group of sGCs with prominent innervation of the deep glomerular layer (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>).

                        "text": "In agreement with our hypothesis, a strikingly higher percentage of sGCs than dGCs fired in response to activation of a single glomerulus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b,e,h</a>) due, at least partially, to stronger excitatory synaptic input to sGCs than dGCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4i</a>). As a caveat, we note that the greater recruitment of sGCs following glomerular activation may arise as an artifact of our acute slice preparation. Specifically, as TC circuitry is closer to any given glomerulus than MC circuitry, TC-mediated input to GCs (likely sGCs) may be better preserved than MC-mediated input to GCs (likely dGCs) in the acute slice, leading to stronger sGC excitation and recruitment following glomerular activation. However, despite the fact that these observations were made in vitro, three lines of evidence support greater feedforward recruitment of sGCs as a physiological feature of the olfactory bulb circuit. First, our in vitro\u00a0observation of greater sGC firing following glomerular activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b,e,h</a>) corresponds well with the previous in vivo\u00a0observation of stronger odor-evoked activity in putative sGCs (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wellis and Scott, 1990</a>). Second, examination of GC biophysical properties revealed several intrinsic differences supporting greater recruitment of sGCs than dGCs, including a more hyperpolarized action potential threshold in sGCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4l</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>,\u00a0Table\u00a02) and greater intrinsic excitability in sGCs in response to somatic step current injections (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4j,k</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>,\u00a0Table\u00a03), despite equivalent somatodendritic sizes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>,\u00a0Table\u00a01) and passive membrane properties (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>,\u00a0Table\u00a04) between sGCs and dGCs. Third, analysis of spontaneous synaptic activity revealed no difference in event frequency or amplitude between sGCs and dGCs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>\u00a0Table\u00a05). Critically, recordings of spontaneous synaptic activity were performed in the absence of TTX and thus contain some degree of action potential-dependent input, which likely originates from intact presynaptic cells. Therefore, equal spontaneous event frequencies between sGCs and dGCs suggests that their respective presynaptic circuits are comparably intact. Moreover, equal spontaneous event amplitudes suggest a comparable contribution of larger action potential-dependent and smaller action potential-independent events between sGCs and dGCs, again consistent with comparably intact presynaptic circuits. In total, our results thus support the hypothesis sGCs are more strongly recruited than dGCs following activation of a single glomerulus due to stronger excitatory input and greater intrinsic excitability, although we cannot rule out an important role for other mechanisms, especially in the intact system in vivo."

At this concentration, DHPG selectively enhances the excitability of GCs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Heinbockel et al., 2004</a>) but not MCs (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The effective activity range of lateral inhibition in MCs (n=6) fell from 31 (\u00b1 9)\u201373 (\u00b1 10) Hz to 16 (\u00b1 12)\u201349 (\u00b1 23) Hz after adding DHPG (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013d</a>), and the lower and upper bounds of the effective activity range of lateral inhibition were significantly reduced after the addition of DHPG (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>). Additionally, these effects did not depend on whether apical dendrites were intact (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>), and therefore does not reflect effects of DHPG on glomerular layer circuitry. Despite these observations, however, we note that increased GC excitability may not be the sole mechanism responsible for these DHPG-induced shifts in the effective range of lateral inhibition. For instance, DHPG-induced increases in the excitability of external tufted\u00a0cells\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Dong and Ennis, 2014</a>) may, in turn, increase the activity in M72-MCs, the activity in GCs and GC-mediated inhibition onto the recorded MC. These data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>) provide two indirect lines of evidence that suggest that differences in GC populations provide one mechanism for differences in the effective activity range of lateral inhibition onto MCs and TCs."

When the odor panel consisted of only 8 odors, both MC and TC populations discriminated between odors with an accuracy that did not differ from the control population that lacked inhibition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6f</a>).

Therefore, we next asked how well these differences between MCs and TCs affect odor discrimination. Differences in the strength of OSN input and intrinsic excitability were modeled by altering sigmoid functions that relate the intensity of glomerular inputs to M/TC outputs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6h</a>). These differences in MC vs. TC excitability and OSN input strength also allow TCs and MCs to discriminate odors best at low and high concentrations respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6i</a>). Finally we simulated how all three differences between MCs and TCs \u2013 ADLI, intrinsic excitability and glomerular input \u2013\u00a0affected odor concentration. Intriguingly, TCs were best at discriminating between low concentration odors when all three differences were included in the model (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6j</a>).

First, we asked whether models containing a combination of MCs and TCs discriminate odors better than models that have only MCs or TCs. We used a variant of the models presented above: here, each glomerulus provided input to 2 neurons instead of 1. We compared three different output neuron configurations: 2 MCs per glomerulus, 2 TCs per glomerulus, and 1 MC and 1 TC per glomerulus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6k</a>, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Similar to the data presented in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6g</a>, TC models discriminated between 32 odors best at low concentrations and MC models were best at high concentrations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6l</a>). However, MC-TC models significantly outperformed other models at intervening odor concentrations. Interestingly, MC-TC models also exhibited the second best performance at high and low concentrations, and after averaging discrimination accuracy across all concentrations tested, we found that models containing a combination of MCs and TCs performed significantly better than models composed of only MCs or only TCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6m</a>). Second, new features might arise in any brain area that implements ADLI and splits information into parallel channels. Using an image processing analogy, we show that if an image is split into parallel channels and then recombined by a downstream population, new information about the image (i.e. higher contrast), absent in either single channel, emerges (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Therefore systems that split sensory information into multiple pathways can not only outperform single pathway systems at comparable tasks, but are also capable of performing novel computations unlikely to occur in single pathway systems."

Yet how local\u00a0circuit activity creates stimulus selectivity in parallel pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we have identified a novel circuit mechanism for generating differential responses across two parallel pathways (formed by MCs and TCs) in the olfactory system and examined the emergence of feature selectivity. We find that differences in ADLI selectively reduce intermediate firing rates in MCs and low firing rates in TCs. We provide evidence that these effects could be caused, in part, by differences in the excitability of subclasses of GCs that preferentially inhibit TCs vs. MCs. Moreover, using simulations, we show that differences in the effective activity range of lateral inhibition, along with other intrinsic and circuit-level differences between MCs and TCs, work cooperatively to enable MCs and TCs to best discriminate between similar odors in separate concentration ranges. Finally, we show that the combination of MCs and TCs facilitates odor discrimination across a wide range of odor concentrations."

Our prior work has shown that increasing the firing rate of presynaptic MCs (the M72 MCs in this case) shifts the range of MC firing rates influenced by lateral inhibition\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Arevian et al., 2008</a>). Given that TCs fire at higher rates than MCs following glomerular activation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Burton and Urban, 2014</a>), M72 TCs will fire at higher rates than M72 MCs following M72 photoactivation and, in part, contribute to the decreased lower bound of the effective activity range of lateral inhibition in postsynaptic TCs.

Additionally, we provide indirect evidence that differences in the recruitability of sGCs and dGCs may be one potential mechanism underlying the differences in ADLI between MCs and TCs. Our data suggests that sGCs spike with a higher probability than dGCs following the activation of a single glomerulus. Consequently, postsynaptic TCs can effectively recruit lateral inhibition when firing at low rates. dGCs are less excitable and therefore require more input to be activated. Therefore M72 photostimulation alone causes relatively weak activation of dGCs. However, when the postsynaptic MC fires at intermediate rates, additional dGCs will become activated and mediate lateral inhibition. In support of this mechanism, we show that increasing the excitability of GCs by activating mGluRs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib19\">Dong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Heinbockel et al., 2007</a>) shifts the effective activity range of lateral inhibition in MCs to lower firing rates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Additionally, these differences between sGCs and dGCs can explain why the upper bound on the effective activity range of lateral inhibition differs between MCs and TCs. Cells firing above this upper bound recruit the maximum amount of recurrent inhibition such that additional inputs to GCs cannot trigger additional GABA release\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib66\">Urban and Arevian, 2009</a>). Because sGCs are more excitable than dGCs, maximal GABA release, and consequently the upper bound on the effective activity range of lateral inhibition, occurs at lower rates in TCs than in MCs (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

However, it is unlikely that EPL-INs predominantly drive the difference in MC vs. TC ADLI given that EPL-INs mediate linear (divisive) but not activity-dependent inhibition of MC/TC outputs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Kato et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Uchida et al., 2013</a>).

Therefore, distinct GC populations that differ in excitability are the most parsimonious explanation for the observed differences in ADLI."

In particular, the slicing procedure may introduce artifacts that could confound our conclusions. Importantly, however, our findings that MCs receive stronger lateral inhibitory currents and are affected at different ranges of firing rates than TCs are unlikely to reflect slicing artifacts. Due to slicing, some MCs and TCs that project to the M72 glomerulus will be truncated, and cells that reside farther from the M72 glomerulus have a higher probability of being truncated. However, our findings do not depend on the cell\u2019s distance from the M72 glomerulus (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, the lateral dendrites of MCs and TCs innervate distinct strata of the EPL and these differences could result in differences in the fraction of original connections left intact following slicing. However, the effect of ADLI on MCs that are observed here following activation of an entire glomerulus closely mirrors the effects that were observed when activating a single presynaptic MC in our previous work\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Arevian et al., 2008</a>). That is, only the probability of finding connections and the absolute magnitude of the effect are increased by activating all of the cells associated with a glomerulus (compared to the prior study when only a single presynaptic cell was activated). This suggests that the critical feature of the effect (maximal lateral inhibition at intermediate firing rates) is a property of single connections rather than one that depends on having a full repertoire of connections intact. Moreover, the close correspondence of our GC data to previous in vivo\u00a0recordings of odor-evoked GC activity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib68\">Wellis and Scott, 1990</a>), as well as the equivalent spontaneous synaptic activity \u2013 a proxy for circuit intactness \u2013 observed between sGCs and dGCs suggests that slicing artifacts cannot explain the differences in excitatory input or intrinsic excitability observed between sGCs and dGCs."

In other sensory systems, different pathways may arise from functional differences at the initial stages of stimulus detection, which are then maintained through selective feedforward connectivity. In the olfactory system there is no evidence that MCs and TCs are targeted by distinct subsets of OSNs. Rather, we show that differences in bulbar circuitry are sufficient to generate important differences in response properties. Here we show that MCs and TCs perform odor discriminations best at separate concentration ranges and that a combination of MCs and TCs discriminates similar odors better than either population alone. These results suggests that parallel processing may offer similar benefits in other sensory systems in which stimulus intensities can vary over many orders of magnitude. For instance, rods and cones in the retina function best at different ranges of light intensity. Other similarities between the olfactory and visual systems suggest that the mechanisms behind parallel processing may be shared across sensory systems. In the retina, feature selectivity in each ganglion cell type emerges due to its connectivity to specific bipolar and amacrine cell types\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib41\">Masland, 2012</a>). Similarly, differences in odor-evoked responses in MCs and TCs emerge due to differences in connectivity to OSNs, external tufted cells\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib49\">Najac et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gire et al., 2012</a>) and GCs. Therefore, in these systems, feature selectivity is not inherited but emerges via differential connectivity with distinct neuron types. Similarly, recombining the specific features encoded in individual channels allows new features to emerge. For instance, if populations of neurons in higher order sensory areas integrate inputs from parallel sensory channels, such as the anterior piriform cortex\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib47\">Nagayama et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Igarashi et al., 2012</a>), and perform simple computations, such as averaging, new features may emerge (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). More complex integration mechanisms may allow the calculation of other complex stimulus features using the different information encoded in multiple parallel sensory channels."

The scheme for generating odor panels and individual odor trials is depicted in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Each odor is represented by the spatial pattern of a 15 \u00d7\u00a010 array of pixels (i.e. glomeruli). For each odor presented at a particular concentration (I<sub>presentation</sub>), we first made Odor 1. To do this, we randomly sampled 1/3 of pixels to represent non-activatable (NA) pixels that are not responsive to odors, regardless of concentration. Next a concentration threshold (T<sub>i</sub>) was sampled from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1000 for each activatable pixel (T<sub>i</sub> = U([0,1000]). Activatable pixels were then divided into ON and OFF pixels. ON pixels were defined as having T<sub>i</sub> &lt; I<sub>presentation</sub>,\u00a0while OFF pixels are ones where T<sub>i</sub> &gt; I<sub>presentation</sub>. Each ON pixel then got a mean activation intensity sampled from a normal distribution (I<sub>base</sub> = N(I<sub>presentation</sub>,\u00a050))."

Each neuron received a leak current, an inhibitory current and an excitatory current input from 1 pixel (<a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>). The excitatory current was calculated by passing the pixel activation strength through a sigmoid. Two differences between MCs and TCs, higher excitability and increased excitatory input are reflected by increased slope (0.007 for MCs and 0.01 for TCs) and reduced midpoint (500 for MCs and 350 for TCs) of the TC sigmoid. MCs/TCs were randomly connected to 75/60% of other MC/TCs, reflecting the shorter extent of lateral dendrites in TCs compared with MCs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">Igarashi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Burton and Urban, 2014</a>). Inhibition was calculated as the product of the sum of network activity, u(t) (<a href=\"#equ5\">Equation 5</a>), and a Gaussian function that determines which range of firing rates are influenced by lateral inhibition (<a href=\"#equ3\">Equations 3,4</a>). The center and width of the MC and TC Gaussian distribution are based on differences in the range of rates influenced by lateral inhibition in our data."

The MC or TC outputs from half of the trials are used to train a na\u00efve Bayes classifier which was then used to predict which odor is being presented on the remaining half of trials. The percent correct is used as the discrimination accuracy for that odor panel. For simulations, we constructed 100 odor panels at each concentration. Concentrations in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a> are plotted as the percent of maximum concentration. The maximum concentration was defined as the concentration that evokes maximum firing rates in MCs and TCs, which in our models is set at 100\u2009Hz \u2013 a rate often observed in vivo.\u00a0A sigmoidal transfer function was used to translate glomerular inputs into MC/TC outputs so that odor concentrations could be defined in terms of MC/TC firing rates while not make any explicit comparisons to actual odor concentrations. Significance in discrimination accuracy between output neuron configurations was determined in 2 steps. First, we conducted one-way ANOVA tests (corrected for multiple comparisons \u2013 i.e. the number of odor concentrations tested) on the discrimination accuracy of the three output neuron configurations at each odor concentration. At concentrations with significant ANOVA tests, we performed post-hoc t-tests to determine whether one particular output neuron configuration was significantly better than the other two. The results of the post-hoc t-tests determine the highlighted areas of <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>."

Evidence is provided based on slice recordings that MCs and TCs differ in the kinetics of lateral inhibition, the spike frequency range over which ADLI is observed, as well was the relative effect of ADLI on spiking. Also, recordings from granule cells (GCs) suggest that differences in ADLI in MCs versus TCs could reflect differences in excitation of two sub-classes of GCs. Finally, computational modeling is used to make the case that differences in ADLI between MCs and TCs can confer differences in the concentration ranges over which the two neuron types best discriminate odors and may also expand the concentration ranges over which odors can be effectively discriminated by the bulb."

Much of the study also employs a powerful experimental paradigm involving optogenetic stimulation of a single, molecularly-defined glomerulus (M72) as a means to drive lateral inhibition. This strategy should eliminate ambiguities about whether only one glomerulus is being stimulated and, also, should reduce variabilities across experiments. Some of the results are also basically convincing, for example that MCs and TCs have different kinetics for lateral inhibition and also differ in the frequency range over which ADLI occurs. However, I have a number of concerns with both the experimental and modeling sections of the paper."

Because ADLI in TCs occurred at low spike frequencies, it seems quite possible that many of the trials in which small effects were actually occurring may have been missed by a per-trial statistical analysis (due to a low total number of spikes). Exclusion of such trials in TCs would have resulted in an artificially large value for the percent change in spike rate due to ADLI, as they calculated it.

The argument is based on the parallel observations that TCs display ADLI at lower spike frequencies than MCs and also that sGCs (which may preferentially contact TCs) are more responsive to glomerular stimulation. However, the authors need to exclude better the possibility that the greater spike probability and evoked currents in sGCs is not a slicing artifact. sGCs, which are closer to glomeruli, may naturally be expected to have more of their input circuitry intact in slices. The fact that sGCs appear to have greater intrinsic excitability helps their argument, but it is not sufficient. Comparing ADLI and the responsiveness of GCs is also complicated by the fact that the experiments assaying these two features appear to have been conducted in differing magnesium concentrations (0.2 mM versus 1 mM)."

DHPG appears not alter MC spiking due to direct current injection (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), yet other circuit effects of DHPG need to be better controlled. For example, DHPG could enhance stimulus-evoked lateral inhibition by altering glomerular layer neurons.

This shows that TCs perform better discrimination at lower odor concentration than MCs. However, it is unclear how much differences in ADLI between MCs versus TCs are contributing to these discrimination curves. The fact that TCs discriminate better at lower concentrations may mainly reflect their greater responsiveness to low concentrations of odor.

The authors show through a combination of patch-clamp recordings, current injections and optogenetic stimulation of genetically labeled glomeruli that activity dependent lateral inhibition (ADLI) occurs at low firing rate regimes in tufted cells and intermediate firing rates in mitral cells. They further propose as underlying substrate at play for the different ADLI regimes two distinct populations of superficial and deep granule cells (sGCs, dGCs). Anatomical reconstructions and clustering suggest that sGCs and dGCs contact differentially the lateral dendrites of TC and respectively MCs. Further functional analysis reveals differences in intrinsic excitability and threshold for action potential firing between sGCs and dGCs consistent with their proposed roles. In my opinion, the manuscript adds important novel understanding by documenting that functional differences between mitral and tufted cells emerge not only due to differences in intrinsic excitability, but also in their local connectivity with inhibitory interneurons. These findings bring timely mechanistic insight that parsimoniously explains recently published differences in TCs and MCs responses to odors, across concentrations, and to modulation of cortical feedback. Therefore, I consider the manuscript fit for publication in <i>eLife</i> should the authors address several concerns listed below."

While the authors argue \u2013 rightly so \u2013 that they perform an in depth mechanistic analysis (which is difficult in vivo) I have to say I tend to agree in that the relevance / role of the differential inhibition for odor processing is still unclear. If indeed \u2013 as stated in the response to prior reviewer 1 \u2013 the variability / signal-to-noise will mask the effect in vivo one might question how dominant it could be in a behaving context.

This differs from responses evoked by stimulation of a single glomerulus, which requires intact cell bodies so that action potentials can pass to the lateral dendrites. That the experiments were conducted in the absence of TTX is not very supportive of there being intact cell bodies, since no evidence is provided to suggest that a major portion of the sEPSCs are being driven by action potentials. They could be mEPSCs (and, notably, the mean amplitudes of the sEPSCs are quite small). In addition, it cannot be excluded that there are spontaneous action potentials in pieces of lateral dendrites that are dissociated from cell bodies. Full-sized action potentials can propagate down mitral cell lateral dendrites, suggesting the presence of sodium channels in these dendrites. To use the spontaneous events as an argument against slice artifacts, the authors would need to perform additional controls (e.g., recordings of miniature events in TTX)."

I previously raised the issue that the DHPG-induced shifts in the effective range of lateral inhibition could reflect drug-effects on glomerular layer neurons rather than GCs. In response, the authors point out that 2 MCs with cut apical dendrites (that do not receive inputs from glomerular layer cells) show similar DHPG-induced shifts in the effective frequency range for ADLI as those MCs with intact apical dendrites. However, these data do not exclude the following plausible network effect involving DHPG-induced excitation of external tufted cells in the glomerular layer (Dong and Ennis, 2014): DHPG-induced excitation of eTCs causes greater feedforward excitation of a population of MCs at a glomerulus; this in turn leads to greater excitation of GCs and GC-mediated inhibition. Such an effect, involving GC inputs onto MC lateral dendrites, would not depend on a test MC having intact apical dendrites."

Therefore, we are likely to lose more M72 MCs than M72 TCs with the slicing procedure. Additionally, prior work (Mori, et al., J Comp Neurol,1983; Scott, et al., J Comp Neurol, 1983) shows that lateral dendrites of MCs and TCs project radially in all directions. Therefore, the lateral dendrites of the remaining MCs and TCs still connecting to the M72 glomerulus are likely to be affected approximately equally by the slicing procedure. Consequently, we would expect that slicing would be more likely to reduce M72-mediated lateral inhibition onto MCs than TCs. However, in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, we find that MCs have stronger lateral inhibition than TCs. Therefore, the differences in lateral inhibition that we report are likely an underestimation of the actual differences between MCs and TCs.

However, the effect of lateral inhibition on MCs that are observed here following activation of an entire glomerulus closely mirrors the effects that were observed when activating a single presynaptic MC in our previous work (Arevian et al., Nat Neuro, 2008). That is, only the probability of finding connections and the absolute magnitude of the effect are increased by activating all of the cells associated with a glomerulus (compared to the prior study when only a single presynaptic cell was activated). This suggests that the critical feature of the effect (maximal lateral inhibition at intermediate firing rates) is a property of single connections rather than one that depends on having a full repertoire of connections intact."

The fact that sGCs appear to have greater intrinsic excitability helps their argument, but it is not sufficient.

The authors show through a combination of patch-clamp recordings, current injections and optogenetic stimulation of genetically labeled glomeruli that activity dependent lateral inhibition (ADLI) occurs at low firing rate regimes in tufted cells and intermediate firing rates in mitral cells. They further propose as underlying substrate at play for the different ADLI regimes two distinct populations of superficial and deep granule cells (sGCs, dGCs). Anatomical reconstructions and clustering suggest that sGCs and dGCs contact differentially the lateral dendrites of TC and respectively MCs. Further functional analysis reveals differences in intrinsic excitability and threshold for action potential firing between sGCs and dGCs consistent with their proposed roles. In my opinion, the manuscript adds important novel understanding by documenting that functional differences between mitral and tufted cells emerge not only due to differences in intrinsic excitability, but also in their local connectivity with inhibitory interneurons. These findings bring timely mechanistic insight that parsimoniously explains recently published differences in TCs and MCs responses to odors, across concentrations, and to modulation of cortical feedback. Therefore, I consider the manuscript fit for publication in eLife should the authors address several concerns listed below.</i>"

I previously raised the issue that the DHPG-induced shifts in the effective range of lateral inhibition could reflect drug-effects on glomerular layer neurons rather than GCs. In response, the authors point out that 2 MCs with cut apical dendrites (that do not receive inputs from glomerular layer cells) show similar DHPG-induced shifts in the effective frequency range for ADLI as those MCs with intact apical dendrites. However, these data do not exclude the following plausible network effect involving DHPG-induced excitation of external tufted cells in the glomerular layer (Dong and Ennis, 2014): DHPG-induced excitation of eTCs causes greater feedforward excitation of a population of MCs at a glomerulus; this in turn leads to greater excitation of GCs and GC-mediated inhibition. Such an effect, involving GC inputs onto MC lateral dendrites, would not depend on a test MC having intact apical dendrites.</i>"
