We have devised a simple biophysical model of a 300 kb-long nucleosome chain, the size of a budding yeast chromosome, constrained by interactions between binding sites of the chromosomal condensin complex, a key component of interphase and mitotic chromosomes. Comparisons of computational and experimental (4C) interaction maps, and other biophysical features, allow us to predict a mode of condensin action. Stochastic condensin-mediated pairwise interactions along the nucleosome chain generate native-like chromosome features and recapitulate chromosome compaction and individualization during mitotic condensation. Higher order interactions between condensin binding sites explain the data less well. Our results suggest that basic assumptions about chromatin behavior go a long way to explain chromosome architecture and are able to generate a molecular model of what the inside of a chromosome is likely to look like."

We have devised a simple biophysical model of a 300 kb-long nucleosome chain, the size of a budding yeast chromosome, constrained by interactions between binding sites of the chromosomal condensin complex, a key component of interphase and mitotic chromosomes. Comparisons of computational and experimental (4C) interaction maps, and other biophysical features, allow us to predict a mode of condensin action. Stochastic condensin-mediated pairwise interactions along the nucleosome chain generate native-like chromosome features and recapitulate chromosome compaction and individualization during mitotic condensation. Higher order interactions between condensin binding sites explain the data less well. Our results suggest that basic assumptions about chromatin behavior go a long way to explain chromosome architecture and are able to generate a molecular model of what the inside of a chromosome is likely to look like."

In mitosis, centimeters of DNA are compacted into micrometer-sized, rod-shaped chromosomes. This allows genetic material to be packed small enough to be faithfully segregated to opposite cell halves, and compact enough to withstand the forces generated during this process. Over the past two decades, accumulating lines of evidence have indicated that the chromosomal condensin complex is a principal mediator of chromosome condensation. Condensin promotes interactions between its chromosomal binding sites (<a href=\"#bib23\">Haeusler et al., 2008</a>), its depletion or genetic mutation in organisms from yeast to vertebrates leads to defective chromosome condensation, reduced mechanical chromosome stability, and consequent chromosome segregation errors (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hirano and Mitchison, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Saka et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Strunnikov et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hagstrom et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hudson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hirota et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Oliveira et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Thadani et al., 2012</a>). Condensin is a member of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family of large ring-shaped multisubunit protein complexes. These are thought to bind to DNA by topological embrace (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nasmyth and Haering, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cuylen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</a>)."

In the more traditional view, condensin forms higher order assemblies within chromosomes, thought of as part of a chromosome scaffold, to which loops of DNA are attached. This view is supported by cytological observations of condensin localization and early biochemical analyses, but also by recent simulations of chromatin interactions within human chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Maeshima and Laemmli, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Swedlow and Hirano, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Naumova et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Maeshima et al., 2014</a>). In a contrasting model, condensin has been proposed to act by providing DNA interactions between its chromosomal binding sites in a more stochastic manner, without the need to engage into higher order assemblies. This idea is supported by measurements of the biophysical properties of chromosomes and high resolution electron tomographic imaging of chromosomes in their close to native state (<a href=\"#bib46\">Poirier and Marko, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">K\u00f6nig et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Thadani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Maeshima et al., 2014</a>).

We then introduce condensin to provide intrachromosomal interactions. These interactions are modeled to be (i) stochastic pairwise interactions between two chromosomal binding sites (Type I model), or (ii) stochastic but able to engage in higher order assemblies where more than two condensin binding sites meet (Type II model). We compare the predictions from these simulations with experimental chromatin proximity data obtained by 4C analysis on budding yeast chromosome 5 and with other measured biophysical chromosome properties. This analysis shows that stochastic pairwise interactions of a chromatin chain, mediated by condensin, provide a close fit to observed chromosome behavior in budding yeast."

This is longer than the two smallest budding yeast chromosomes, and similar for example, to the length of the long arm of budding yeast chromosome 5. We applied a \u2018bead-spring\u2019 model in which the chromatin chain is represented as a series of nucleosome beads, joined by DNA linkers whose dynamic behavior is approximated as springs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The nucleosome string thus behaves as a chain, where the DNA linkers regulate the movement of joined nucleosomes according to Hooke's law. The movement of each nucleosome bead follows a Brownian dynamic trajectory, approximating the solution state in the nucleus. Nucleosomes exclude each other in space though, during our simulations, the linker DNA can cross itself with a small probability, which, under in vivo conditions would be achieved by the enzyme topoisomerase II. A weak force corrects the angle at which DNA emerges from the nucleosome surface (<a href=\"#bib33\">Luger et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bednar et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Engelhardt, 2007</a>) (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details of the model)."

This was guided by the experimentally visualized condensin distribution along budding yeast chromosomes using chromatin immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">D'Ambrosio et al., 2008</a>), which revealed condensin-enriched peaks with an average distance of approximately 10 kb (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We therefore assigned a condensin binding site approximately every 10 kb along the chromatin chain. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> shows a relaxed conformation of the resultant chromatin chain at the beginning of our simulations. If, on their stochastic trajectories, two condensin binding sites come within 40 nm of each other, an interaction is established between them. While we are as yet na\u00efve about how condensin bridges two binding sites, this assumption lies at the heart of the majority of models for condensin action. The attraction radius of 40 nm is based on condensin's molecular architecture (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson et al., 2002</a>), the ability of chromosomes to compact was insensitive to its exact value. Once established, the interactions dissolve with a model-specific dissociation probability, equivalent to an off-rate of the dynamically chromosome-bound condensin complex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gerlich et al., 2006</a>)."

In our Type I model, each condensin binding site can interact with exactly one other site at a time, thus leading to stochastic pairwise interactions between chromatin segments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In the Type II model, each condensin binding site can interact with up to two others, thereby allowing the formation of higher order condensin binding site assemblies. This model provides a means to interrogate chromosome behavior based on first principles."

To do so, we used a budding yeast strain in which two loci on the chromosome 5 long arm, at 144 kb distance from each other, were fluorescently marked in distinct colors using the TetO/TetR-YFP and LacO/LacI-CFP systems, respectively (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rohner et al., 2008</a>). This allowed us to measure their in vivo 3D distance with great precision, yielding interphase distances consistent with previous measurements using loci marked with the same fluorophore (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guacci et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bystricky et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">D'Ambrosio et al., 2008</a>). In G1-arrested cells, the mean distance between the loci was 670 nm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), which was similar to the distance of similarly spaced loci in the relaxed starting configuration of our model (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This striking correspondence suggests that interphase chromatin in vivo adopts a configuration of similar dimensions as compared to the dimensions of an unconstrained nucleosome fiber."

In case of Type I interactions, the marker distance fluctuated around 600\u2013700 nm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Allowing Type II interactions resulted in a slightly more compacted chromosome and marker distances between 500\u2014600 nm.

The compaction ratio was slightly less than reported in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib22\">Guacci et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Strunnikov et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Vas et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">D'Ambrosio et al., 2008</a>). A likely reason is our use of two colors to distinguish the two loci. This allows us to assign a discrete distance even to close foci in mitosis that would have been considered to be at zero distance due to the resolution limit in single color observations. We note that a twofold volume compaction during budding yeast chromosome condensation is similar to what is observed for example, when comparing human interphase and mitotic chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mora-Berm\u00fadez et al., 2006</a>). When we reduced condensin's dissociation probability in our simulations, akin to the stabilization of condensin binding to chromosomes that has been observed as human cells enter mitosis (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gerlich et al., 2006</a>), chromosomes began to compact. A 10-fold reduction of dissociation probability in the Type I model resulted in a 25% length compaction, comparable to what we observed in vivo (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Further reduction of the dissociation probability led to further gradual compaction. In the Type II model, a 10-fold reduction of the dissociation probability caused a length compaction of over 40%, more than what is observed in vivo (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). A smaller reduction of the dissociation probability by only twofold, to 5 \u00d7 10 <sup>\u22124</sup>, led to a bistable behavior of the chromosome, its compaction fluctuating between open and closed equilibrium states of similar dimensions as those obtained at 1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup> and 1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These observations suggest that the half-life of condensin-mediated interactions along a chromatin fiber has the potential to determine the chromosome condensation status. Type I interactions allow compaction to be tuned within a physiological range. In contrast, Type II interactions result in a more stepwise compaction, the degree of which exceeds what we observed in vivo."

Intrachromosomal interactions markedly increased in mitotic cells, both in the vicinity of the view point as well as longer range interactions beyond 100 kb. This increase depended on the condensin complex and was largely reduced when condensin was depleted from nuclei using the <i>brn1-aa</i> allele (<a href=\"#bib7\">Charbin et al., 2014</a>).

In both models, L<sub>p</sub> increases with greater genomic distances, as expected from loop polymers (<a href=\"#bib55\">Strobl, 1997</a>). At smaller genomic distances, up to \u223c150 kb, the two models show comparable persistence lengths, with values in agreement with experimental L<sub>p</sub> estimates in budding yeast of 58\u2013134 nm, based on physical distance and 3C interaction frequency measurements in this distance range (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dekker, 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

At distances greater than 150 kb, the persistence lengths of Type I and II chromosomes becomes significantly distinct. To our knowledge, there is currently no experimental estimate for L<sub>p</sub> at these distances, which may be in part due to the difficulty of constraining L<sub>p</sub> values by fitting experimental data to analytical functions at these distances.

If chromosome condensation indeed occurs by stochastic pairwise interactions between condensin binding sites, how does condensin discriminate intrachromosomal interactions that condense a chromosome from interchromosomal interactions that lead to unproductive chromosome crosslinks? To explore this, we simulated chromosome condensation of two 300 kb long chromatin chains lying adjacent to each other (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3, 4</a>). As expected, we observed condensin-mediated interactions both within and between chromosomes. In the Type I model, intrachromosomal interactions became dominant over time and the two chromosomes formed individual entities, while maintaining occasional dynamic contact between their surfaces. Starting from the same chromosome positions, the Type II model also displayed a tendency for chromosomes to individualize. However, the more stable nature of rosette-like interaction hubs that formed both within and between chromosomes often maintained the two chromosomes in an entangled state and prevented their complete separation. These results show that condensin-mediated interactions individualize chromosomes, as condensin is more likely to encounter binding sites along the same nucleosome string compared to binding sites on two independently moving chains. Dynamic pairwise interactions between condensin binding sites are better able to prevent persistent cross-linking of chromosomes than rosette-like interaction hubs."

We compare the emergent model behavior to a panel of existing and new in vivo measurements. Previous models have studied the behavior of short chromatin pieces, including details about nucleosome structure (<a href=\"#bib65\">Woodcock et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Grigoryev et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schlick and Perisi\u0107, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Diesinger and Heermann, 2010</a>).

A defining feature of our coarse-grained nucleosome polymer model is that it allows higher order chromosome structure to arise from first principles, the physics of a solvated polymer chain driven by non-specific entropic forces that generate Brownian motion. The model uses a simulated 10 nm nucleosome chain, to which we add two different scenarios of how the chromosomal condensin complex might act. The emergent chromosome architecture is strikingly in line with numerous features that we and others have measured in vivo, offering quasi-molecular insight into what the inside of a chromosome might look like."

The reason for this surprise is that a nucleosome chain is often portrayed as beads on a straight line. However, a straight line presents a highly ordered state and entropic forces work to fold this into a much more irregular configuration. The angle at which DNA emanates from a nucleosome further promotes generation of a more rugged path of the nucleosome chain. These results suggest that interphase chromatin exists in a relatively relaxed state inside a budding yeast nucleus and that there may be no need to invoke major forces, scaffolds or other organizing principles to explain its packing. The modeled chromatin packing density, when scaled up to the entirety of the budding yeast genome, allows its comfortable fit within the budding yeast nucleus (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

Our 4C results suggest that condensin binding sites are hubs of intrachromosomal interactions, and that these interactions are promoted by the condensin complex. We do not yet know how condensin promotes intrachromosomal interactions. One condensin ring might sequentially topologically entrap DNA at two of its binding sites, or two condensin complexes at their respective binding sites might interact with each other. In addition, condensin might engage in interactions with chromatin or nucleosomes at places distinct from its primary binding sites, and such additional contacts might display similar or different characteristics from topological DNA interactions. While the molecular biology underlying condensin's binding mechanism is important to explore, our simulations are oblivious to the molecular details that underlie the interactions. Instead, we found that the half-life and topology of interactions that each condensin binding site can engage in profoundly affects chromosome behavior."

The latter mode allows the seeding and propagation of higher order assemblies of condensin binding sites, in a way that is often portrayed in models of condensin action. Having compared the two models in our simulations, we conclude that Type I interactions fare better at generating a wide spectrum of chromosomal features that match in vivo observations, including genomic to physical distance distributions and intrachromosomal interaction maps in both interphase and mitosis. The Type I interactions also perform better in individualizing neighboring chromosomes during their mitotic condensation. It has been suggested, on theoretical grounds, that a \u2018weak chromatin glue\u2019 is required to allow chromosome individualization during condensation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Marko and Siggia, 1997</a>). In our Type I model, this weakness is achieved by ongoing dynamic reorganization of the chromatin web, compared to the more stable rosette structures formed by Type II interactions. From a physical point of view, a dynamic web structure allows the small advantage of intrachromosomal interactions, arising from the physical continuity of the chromatin chain, to separate chromosomes over time. In other words, it provides a safeguard to reduce the degree of entanglement, should it occur. We cannot exclude that both Type I and II interaction modes occur simultaneously on chromosomes. Indeed, rosette-like interaction hubs transiently form during simulations based on Type I interactions. It remains possible that modifications to condensin, for example due to different levels of phosphorylation, could alter the balance between the Type I and II mechanisms. In any event, our simulations suggest that maintaining a dynamic aspect of chromatin interactions confers advantages during the chromosome condensation process."

On the one hand, a web-like chromosome architecture is consistent with biophysical and microscopic analyses also of higher eukaryotic chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Poirier and Marko, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">K\u00f6nig et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nishino et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Thadani et al., 2012</a>). On the other hand, our model is doubtless an oversimplification. Condensin is only one of at least three SMC family complexes in eukaryotes, all of which are likely to act as chromatin crosslinkers by promoting DNA interactions. In addition, many organisms contain more than one type of condensin complex, whose chromosomal distributions appear to be distinct. Condensin might also interact with histones and histones in turn engage with each other, while both types of contact are regulated by posttranslational modifications. Linker histones, in organisms that encode them, alter the flexibility of the nucleosome chain. We expect that a plethora of inputs have the potential to modulate or add parameters in our model. What our study shows is that simple assumptions based on first principles go a long way towards explaining chromosome behavior. It will be fascinating to extend similar simulations to much longer nucleosome chains. Will topologically associating domains, that are seen in large chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dixon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mizuguchi et al., 2014</a>), emerge from subtle inhomogeneities in the condensin distribution? Which additional principles will have to be incorporated into the model to make an iconic metazoan X-shaped mitotic chromosome gain shape?"

An important feature of our Type I and II model is the probabilistic nature of the cross-linking mechanism, which allows the organization of the chromatin fibre to be dynamic, rather than being a fixed structure. Another important feature of the Type I and II models is the application of physical forces at the nucleosome level. The trajectory of the fiber backbone is regulated by forces, as described below, based on first principle physics. The balance of all forces is calibrated based on experimental measurements of nucleosome movements and the angles between neighboring nucleosome linkers. Without arbitrary parameters to pre-define the conformation of the chromosome chain (i.e., no conformation parameters), the models allow a direct examination of how chromosome conformations emerge from different modes of condensin interactions (i.e., stochastic pairwise interactions and higher order condensing assemblies for the Type I and II models, respectively)."

In our model, using the parameter set given below, the displacement distribution is of comparable shape to the experimental observation, with a mean and standard deviation of 30.9 \u00b1 13.4 nm/30 ms (Type I model) or 30.8 \u00b1 13.3 nm/30 ms (Type II model), compared to a mean of 51.2 nm/30 ms in the experiment (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The force fine-tunes the distribution of the \u03b1 angle between three consecutive beads and does not serve as a driving factor for any pre-defined local structures: the \u03b1 angle distribution for our simulated chromosomes has a bell shape curve, which peaks at around 70\u00b0 (benchmarked with experimental measurements of the \u03b1 angle of 75\u00b0, based on the nucleosome crystal structure [<a href=\"#bib33\">Luger et al., 1997</a>]) and tails off at around 20\u00b0 and 180\u00b0, consistent with the relative flexibility that is thought to characterize the \u03b1 angle (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bednar et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Engelhardt, 2007</a>). This means that the model does not exclude the possibility of forming small fragments of locally compact structures that resemble the 20\u201330 nm fibers widely speculated in other models (the \u03b1 angle of a 30 nm fiber is centered at 36\u00b0 or 108\u00b0).

Simulations with these new parameter values using the Type I model resulted in similar chromosome dimensions and native-like condensation, while the Type II model again showed a tendency to overly compact chromosomes. The fraction of long-range interactions beyond 100 kB was somewhat lower but compatible with the experimental data in the Type I model. They markedly exceeded the observed range in the Type II model. We conclude that the main features and differences between the Type I and Type II models are insensitive to variations in the K<sub>s</sub> and <math id=\"inf50\"><mrow><msubsup><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>F</mi><mo stretchy=\"true\">\u2192</mo></mover></mrow><mi>i</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"italic\">entropic</mi></mrow></msubsup></mrow></math> values. We note that the inter-nucleosome tension with either parameter pair is insufficient to disrupt the histone/DNA interaction, though forces in the low pN range may in some cases, depending on the DNA sequence, lead to elastic DNA breathing on the nucleosome surface (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ngo et al., 2015</a>)."

Firstly, we defined a space big enough to enclose the chromosome then we partitioned the space into joined 3D grids. We counted the number of grid cells occupied by at least one nucleosome. The volume of the chromosome was the sum of the volumes of the occupied grid cells. The accuracy of this approach depends on the grid size used to partition the space. Small grids underestimate the chromosome volume by omitting internal spaces that are surrounded by the chromosome and that are hence not reachable by other chromosomes. Large grids tend to overestimate the volume by including an excess of external surrounding space that could be available to neighboring chromosomes. Here, we use a grid of 50 nm cubes, corresponding to the observed persistence length at small distances in our simulated structures. As the chromosome volume is determined by the curvature of the chromatin chain, closely related to its persistence length, this is aimed to reduce the effect of both over- or underestimating chromosome volume."

By scaling both numbers by a factor of 40 we project the volume of our 300 kb chromosome to the volume of the 12 Mb budding yeast genome. This yields approximately 2 \u00b1 0.07 \u03bcm<sup>3</sup> for chromosomes that behave according to the Type I model. This accounts for half the volume of the yeast nucleus, assuming a diameter of 2 \u03bcm and corresponding volume of approximately 4 \u03bcm<sup>3</sup> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gasser, 2002</a>).

Using the simplifying assumption of a bead spring model for nucleosomes and various ways to represent condensin (bridging two sites or more sites, Type I and Type II) they go a remarkable long way toward capturing the major experimental measurement in the literature as well as their new data. Known sites of condensin binding are assumed to coalesce into one complex temporarily if they come within 40 nm of each other, the capture radius consistent with the physical dimension of condensin. The lifetime of the complex is used as a parameter that can be used to tune the dynamic nature of such interaction and is the sole parameter varied between interphase and mitotic chromatin. In Type II model, more than two condensin binding sites are allowed to coalesce. Remarkably, simulations can explain the main features of the experimental data with Type I model performing significantly better. What's attractive about this work is that a simple physical model can get us quite far in explaining the chromosome behavior at a quantitative level, and that the model is general enough that straightforward extensions to include other effects may be possible in the future. In general this is a nice manuscript and clearly explained."

My understanding was that the persistence length was dictated by the physical properties of the chain, independent of where you are on the chain. Again, there is no question that the chain explores more space in the middle (Increased Rc, see Verdaasdonk, ibid.) and less at the ends, but this is not due to change in Lp, rather at least for a chromosome is a result from tethering. The authors need to justify their statement that Lp increases with increased genomic distance.</cos\u03b8(s)>"

This results in a weakening of the tension between consecutive nucleosomes to \u223c2.2 pN (compared to \u223c4.7pN using the original parameters). Of note, tension in either range should not lead to substantial DNA unwrapping from the nucleosomes which occurs when tension approaches 20 pN (Bennik et al. 2001). The analysis of the resulting simulations showed that the main features and differences between the Type I and Type II are similar to what is observed with the original parameters and therefore that the model is robust."

However, the use of this equation does not yield a good fit to our data. The reason is that in a loop-based model, unlike in a worm-like model, the movement of the chromatin fibre is constrained by the loops, such that Lp increases with greater genomic distances. This becomes apparent when analyzing our chromosome structures using equation (Naumove, 2013), but also when comparing persistence length measurements in budding yeast that were performed at different length scales (e.g. compare <a href=\"#bib11\">Dekker 2008</a> and <a href=\"#bib25\">Hajjoul et al. 2013</a>_).
