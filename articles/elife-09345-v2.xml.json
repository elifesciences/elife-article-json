MMP14 is a potent pericellular collagenase that can cleave type I collagen in vitro. In this study, we show that tendon development is arrested in <i>Scleraxis-Cre::Mmp14</i> lox/lox mice that are unable to release collagen fibrils from plasma membrane fibripositors. In contrast to its role in collagen turnover in adult tissue, MMP14 promotes embryonic tissue formation by releasing collagen fibrils from the cell surface. Notably, the tendons grow to normal size and collagen fibril release from fibripositors occurs in <i>Col-r/r</i> mice that have a mutated collagen-I that is uncleavable by MMPs. Furthermore, fibronectin (not collagen-I) accumulates in the tendons of <i>Mmp14</i>-null mice. We propose a model for cell-regulated collagen fibril assembly during tendon development in which MMP14 cleaves a molecular bridge tethering collagen fibrils to the plasma membrane of fibripositors."

All animals were sacrificed by a Schedule 1 procedure by trained personnel. MMP14 KO mice were as described previously (Zhou et al., 2000). To generate mice in which MMP14 is ablated in tendon-lineage cells, we crossed mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of Scleraxis (ScxCre; C57BL/6) (Blitz et al., 2013) with mice carrying the floxed exons (exons 2 to 4) of the MMP14 gene (MMP14-floxed; C57BL/6) (Zigrino et al., 2012). MMP13 KO embryos were a generous gift from Zena Werb (Stickens et al., 2004). MMP2 heterozygous mice were imported from RIKEN BioResource Center (GelAKO/RBRC00398; C57) (Itoh et al., 1997) and bred to homozygosity. Col-r/r mice were imported from Jackson Laboratory (B6;129S4-Col1a1tm1Jae/J) (Liu et al., 1995). X-ray analyses were performed as described previously (Yeung et al., 2014)."

MMP14 is a potent pericellular collagenase that can cleave type I collagen in vitro. In this study, we show that tendon development is arrested in <i>Scleraxis-Cre::Mmp14</i> lox/lox mice that are unable to release collagen fibrils from plasma membrane fibripositors. In contrast to its role in collagen turnover in adult tissue, MMP14 promotes embryonic tissue formation by releasing collagen fibrils from the cell surface. Notably, the tendons grow to normal size and collagen fibril release from fibripositors occurs in <i>Col-r/r</i> mice that have a mutated collagen-I that is uncleavable by MMPs. Furthermore, fibronectin (not collagen-I) accumulates in the tendons of <i>Mmp14</i>-null mice. We propose a model for cell-regulated collagen fibril assembly during tendon development in which MMP14 cleaves a molecular bridge tethering collagen fibrils to the plasma membrane of fibripositors."

All animals were sacrificed by a Schedule 1 procedure by trained personnel. MMP14 KO mice were as described previously (Zhou et al., 2000). To generate mice in which MMP14 is ablated in tendon-lineage cells, we crossed mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of Scleraxis (ScxCre; C57BL/6) (Blitz et al., 2013) with mice carrying the floxed exons (exons 2 to 4) of the MMP14 gene (MMP14-floxed; C57BL/6) (Zigrino et al., 2012). MMP13 KO embryos were a generous gift from Zena Werb (Stickens et al., 2004). MMP2 heterozygous mice were imported from RIKEN BioResource Center (GelAKO/RBRC00398; C57) (Itoh et al., 1997) and bred to homozygosity. Col-r/r mice were imported from Jackson Laboratory (B6;129S4-Col1a1tm1Jae/J) (Liu et al., 1995). X-ray analyses were performed as described previously (Yeung et al., 2014)."

TEM analysis showed E15.5 WT tendons contained collagen fibrils in the ECM and a small number of collagen fibrils in fibripositors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, <i>Mmp14</i> KO tendons contained conspicuous electron-lucent invaginations characteristic of recessed fibripositors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). There were \u223c8 times the number of fibripositor cross-sections per nucleus in KO tenocytes (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Tracing of fibrils in 3D reconstructions from SBF-SEM and electron tomography (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>) showed the presence of deep recessed fibripositors in <i>Mmp14</i> KO cells (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1, 2</a>, respectively) with looped collagen fibrils. <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> shows a diagrammatic representation of a typical recessed fibripositor containing looped collagen fibrils."

WT tendon contained numerous fibril tips and short fibrils (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In contrast, fibril tips were less frequent in KO tendon (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We then calculated the mean length of fibrils based on the relative frequency of tips-to-shaft numbers. The average fibril length in E15.5 WT tendon was 16 \u00b1 3 \u03bcm whereas that in an age-matched and anatomical-site-matched <i>Mmp14</i> KO tendon was 38 \u00b1 6 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). At E15.5, the tendon cross-sectional area and the FVF in WT and KO samples were not significantly different (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Therefore, given the same transverse area occupied by collagen fibrils in WT and KO tissue, the difference in collagen mean fibril length equates to a \u223c2.5-fold reduction in fibril number in KO tendon. Analysis at E16.5 confirmed that fibrils were, on average, shorter in WT tendon than KO tendon (mean length 50 \u00b1 9 \u03bcm) compared with 111 \u00b1 26 \u03bcm (n = 668 WT fibrils, 683 KO fibrils, respectively, each tracked over 10 \u03bcm)."

Smaller tendon (tail and Achilles) size and weaker bones were also observed in 7-week-old <i>Scx-Cre::Mmp14 lox/lox</i> mice. The mice became distressed from 7 weeks therefore analyses were performed no later than 7 weeks postnatal. Morphometric analysis of x-rays confirmed that <i>Scx-Cre::Mmp14 lox/lox</i> mice had significantly shorter cranium length and stunted skeletal growth (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

Care was taken to minimize muscle contamination and to remove as much associated loose connective tissue as possible. Although not quantitative, the analysis identified specific macromolecules that appear to be more abundant in <i>Scx-Cre::Mmp14 lox/lox</i> and global <i>Mmp14</i> KO tendons than in WT (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Peptides from FN were consistently more abundant in <i>Mmp14</i>-deficient samples. We identified a unique peptide from FN that was found in WT tendon in vivo and which contained an additional alanine residue at its N-terminus in <i>Mmp14</i>-deficient tendons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), suggesting that MMP14 is responsible for cleaving FN between Ala(1078) and Thr(1079). This was confirmed by LS/MS\u2013MS analysis of recombinant human FN treated with recombinant human MMP14 prior to digestion with trypsin (data not shown). Immunofluorescence analysis at E15.5 showed accumulation of FN in <i>Scx-Cre::Mmp14 lox/lox</i> tendons compared to WT tendons and the levels of FN appeared to progressively accumulate in KO tendons at P0 and P10 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The LS-MS/MS analyses also identified periostin and integrins including \u03b111\u03b21 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Analysis of periostin in tendons showed similar intensities at E15.5 and P0 but was increased in the tendon epithelium at P10 <i>Scx-Cre::Mmp14 lox/lox</i> mice compared to WT mice (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Subsequent western blot analysis of P7 mice confirmed that levels of FN were higher in <i>Scx-Cre::Mmp14 lox/lox</i> tendons compared to WT littermates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). We stripped and re-probed the blot for periostin detection and confirmed that it was not accumulated to the extent FN was in <i>Scx-Cre::Mmp14 lox/lox</i> tendons (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

In WT mouse tendons, fibripositors disappear and collagen fibrils are released to the ECM soon after birth (marking the end of stage 1), and the fibrils grow in diameter and length (marking the start of stage 2) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kalson et al., 2015</a>). In the absence of MMP14, the fibrils are retained within fibripositors and the number of collagen fibrils formed during stage 1 is reduced. As a result, tendons in <i>Mmp14</i>-deficient mice are thinner compared to WT. Although MMP14 is capable of cleaving type I collagen at the \u00be-\u00bc helical site, we show that cleavage at this site is not required for tendon development. Interestingly, FN accumulates in <i>Mmp14</i>-deficient tendons. Thus, we propose that the ability of MMP14 to cleave macromolecules other than type I collagen is essential for releasing collagen fibrils from fibripositors."

As shown previously, the lateral size of the tendon is established during embryonic development when embryonic tenocytes assemble a finite number of collagen fibrils at fibripositors (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kalson et al., 2015</a>). The fibrils are released after birth and subsequently grow in length and diameter in a process of matrix expansion. Therefore, the fewer fibrils in <i>Mmp14</i>-deficient tendons appear to be a direct result of the inability of the cells to release collagen fibrils to the ECM before a new cycle of fibril assembly can begin. In the presence of continued collagen synthesis (albeit at a reduced rate [<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>]), the existing fibrils continue to grow in length and diameter at the expense of nucleation of new fibrils.

Therefore, although type I collagen is cleaved at the \u00be-\u00bc site during embryonic development, cleavage is not essential for tendon development. While the <i>Col-r/r</i> mutation renders the triple helix resistant to cleavage by MMPs, rodent MMP13 recognizes an additional cleavage site C-terminal to the N-telopeptide crosslink (<a href=\"#bib31\">Krane et al., 1996</a>). <a href=\"#bib34\">Liu et al. (1995)</a> reported that the MMP13 cleavage site in type I collagen permits normal remodeling during development and early postnatal life, but that cleavage at the \u00be-\u00bc site is needed for subsequent remodeling and accounts for the observed progressive marked skin fibrosis in the <i>Col-r/r</i>. Our data agree with these conclusions and show that MMP13 (and MMP2) is not essential for tendon development. The fact that degradative vacuoles are rare in embryonic <i>Mmp14</i> KO tenocytes and that fibril numbers were reduced and fibril lengths are greater in <i>Mmp14</i> KO cells, suggests that the vacuoles might be part of a mechanism to regulate fibril number and/or length."

Periostin is highly expressed by epithelial cells, is bound by \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins, is upregulated in epithelial tumors to support adhesion and migration (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gillan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yuyama et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Liu and Du, 2015</a>), and is a prognostic marker for TH2-driven asthma (<a href=\"#bib46\">Parulekar et al., 2014</a>) and lung fibrosis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amara et al., 2015</a>). Additional studies have shown that periostin supports tendon formation in an ectopic mouse model of the development of tenogenic tissue (<a href=\"#bib42\">Noack et al., 2014</a>). Evidence also suggests that periostin interacts with type I collagen to regulate collagen fibrillogenesis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Noack et al., 2014</a>). It has also been reported that periostin deficiency might cause collagen fibril disorganization and affect the distribution of FN (<a href=\"#bib54\">Tabata et al., 2014</a>). We showed that periostin was increased in the tendon epithelium (<a href=\"#bib58\">Taylor et al., 2011</a>) that surrounds the body of the tendon, in P10 <i>Scx-Cre::Mmp14 lox/lox</i> mice compared to WT mice (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Periostin can be cleaved by MMP14 in vitro (<a href=\"#bib52\">Stegemann et al., 2013</a>) and therefore its accumulation in the epithelium could be a direct result of substrate accumulation.

FN is a core component of extracellular matrices (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mao and Schwarzbauer, 2005</a>) and has an important role in development (<a href=\"#bib14\">George et al., 1993</a>) and wound healing (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sakai et al., 2001</a>). Mice lacking FN are embryonic lethal with defects in mesoderm formation (<a href=\"#bib14\">George et al., 1993</a>). Furthermore, FN co-distributes with type I and III collagen (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fleischmajer and Timpl, 1984</a>). To understand if the presence of elevated levels of FN could explain the fibripositor phenotype, we incubated tendon-like constructs with exogenous FN. This resulted in a profound increase in appearance of fibripositors. Taking the EM, LC-MS/MS, and tendon-construct data together, we propose that FN forms a \u2018molecular bridge\u2019 between the cell and the collagen fibril.

In contrast, several proteins were over-represented in <i>Mmp14</i>-deficient tendons. These included filamin A, which has functions in cell\u2013ECM adhesion (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nakamura et al., 2011</a>) and mechanotransduction (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jahed et al., 2014</a>). As tendons are predominately ECM, changes in ECM composition and cell\u2013ECM interactions are likely to have profound effects on cell signaling (e.g., ECM growth factor presentation) as well as the growth and mechanical properties of tendon leading to changes in musculoskeletal development. Finally, the tendons, cartilage, muscle, and bone are peripheral circadian clocks, each with their unique circadian transcriptome (see [<a href=\"#bib60\">Yeung et al., 2014a</a>] and reviewed by <a href=\"#bib11\">Dudek and Meng (2014)</a>). Therefore, changes in the organization and mechanical properties of the tendon might affect its circadian entrainment and that of adjacent musculoskeletal tissues."

Tendon (from tail) diameters were measured from digital photographs. The diameter, d, was then used to calculate transverse area according to the formula \u03c0d<sup>2</sup>/4. This assumed a circular transverse shape as used in mechanical testing of tissue engineered ligament (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hairfield-Stein et al., 2007</a>). An average of three diameter measurements was recorded for each tendon. The original contour length of tendons was measured from a digital photograph of the mounted construct. A tare load of 10 mN was applied at the start of the tensile test to fully straighten the tendon. The length at failure was determined from the Instron test (giving change in length L\u0394). The tendons were tested to failure with a strain rate of 5 mm per minute (equivalent to approximately 1% strain per second)."

The tendons were prepared for TEM and SBF-SEM as described (<a href=\"#bib51\">Starborg et al., 2013</a>), with care being taken to maintain the length and tension during fixation. Sections (70-nm thick) were examined for TEM using an FEI Tecnai 12 instrument fitted with a 2k \u00d7 2k-cooled CCD camera (F214A, Tietz Video and Image Processing Systems, Gauting, Germany). Serial section electron tomography was completed as described using semi-thick (300 nm) serial sections were collected on formvar-coated copper slot grids. Orthogonal tilt series were then acquired on a FEI Tecnai Polara TEM operated at 300 kV (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kalson et al., 2013</a>). Tomograms were generated and contours modeled in IMOD (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kremer et al., 1996</a>). The methods used for SBF-SEM were as described (<a href=\"#bib51\">Starborg et al., 2013</a>) using a Gatan 3View microtome within an FEI Quanta 250 scanning microscope. Cell number measurements were made on 3 separate SBF-SEM samples for WT and <i>Mmp14</i> KO tail tendons at P0. The volume of the tendon tissue in each SBF-SEM 3D reconstruction was calculated and all the cells in the volume were reconstructed using IMOD. Each cell nucleus contained within the reconstruction was identified and counted. Cells per 1000 \u03bcm<sup>3</sup> of tissue were calculated to allow comparison between samples. ImmunoEM was performed as previously described using high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution into LR White resin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Canty et al., 2004</a>). A rabbit anti-Collagen-I antibody (T40777R; Meridian Life Science, Inc.) and a mouse anti-MMP14 antibody (MAB3328; Merk Millipore) were used."

The manuscript provides a detailed analysis of the MMP14 (MT1-MMP) knockout phenotype in the tendon. They show that <i>Mmp14</i>-null mice have reduced tendon cross sectional area and fewer fibrils at birth. They also observed an increase in fibril diameter and fibripositor number. This is specific to MMP14 as other MMP knockouts do not phenocopy these characteristics. The phenotype does not appear to be due to MMP cleavage of collagen as examination of a cleavage insensitive collagen knockout does not phenocopy the MMP14 results. Fibronectin amounts were increased in MMP14 deficient tendons and in vitro assays demonstrated that incubation with fibronectin caused more pronounced fibripositors. This leads to the novel conclusion that MMP14 is necessary for tendon growth by mediating the release of collagen into the ECM."

Hence, the work requires major revision as multiple findings presented in the paper appear disjointed or lack sufficient data to fully support the main conclusions. These major issues are: 1) The authors outline two stages of tendon development: in the first stage (from E14.5-) collagen fibril number is increased, and the second stage, at early postnatal stages, the fibrils are released to the ECM where they grow in length and diameter, and fibripositors disappear. They conclude that MMP14 is required for the progression from stage 1 to stage 2, affecting tissue expansion. However, their data suggest that MMP14 may act at multiple stages of tendon development. There is a lack of clarity on the phenotype and stages analyzed for the <i>Scx-Cre-Mmp14</i> tissue specific knockout compared with the null. Much of their data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1-3</a>) are on the phenotype of the <i>Mmp14</i>-null mice at embryonic and early postnatal stages (due to the early lethality limiting later analysis), yet the tendon phenotype of the CKO at corresponding stages is unclear. The stages are not specified and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> legend is missing. The data shown for the CKO appears to be a much later stage. The authors need to include earlier embryonic and postnatal analysis to demonstrate that stage 1 is normal in these mice and that stage 2 at early postnatal stages is disrupted. It would be valuable to include an analysis of fibronectin at these earlier stages. If over-accumulation of fibronectin is involved in their phenotype, there should be increased fibronectin levels preceding or coincident with the matrix changes. The complete null appears to have disruption in both stages. The authors detect fewer collagen fibrils that are looped and longer in length from embryonic (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, and some of the supplemental figures to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and P0 analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Postnatal data is given for the <i>Scx-Cre-Mmp14</i> conditional knockout, but their tendons appear more significantly affected (comparing <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> with <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The authors should clarify the function of MMP14 at both embryonic and early postnatal stages, and if their data support a direct or indirect role for MMP14 in these processes."
