Adult pluripotent stem cells drive this ability, but how injury activates and directs stem cells into the appropriate lineages is unclear. Here we describe a single-organ regeneration assay in which ejection of the planarian pharynx is selectively induced by brief exposure of animals to sodium azide. To identify genes required for pharynx regeneration, we performed an RNAi screen of 356 genes upregulated after amputation, using successful feeding as a proxy for regeneration. We found that knockdown of 20 genes caused a wide range of regeneration phenotypes and that RNAi of the forkhead transcription factor <i>FoxA</i>, which is expressed in a subpopulation of stem cells, specifically inhibited regrowth of the pharynx. Selective amputation of the pharynx therefore permits the identification of genes required for organ-specific regeneration and suggests an ancient function for FoxA-dependent transcriptional programs in driving regeneration."

Adult pluripotent stem cells drive this ability, but how injury activates and directs stem cells into the appropriate lineages is unclear. Here we describe a single-organ regeneration assay in which ejection of the planarian pharynx is selectively induced by brief exposure of animals to sodium azide. To identify genes required for pharynx regeneration, we performed an RNAi screen of 356 genes upregulated after amputation, using successful feeding as a proxy for regeneration. We found that knockdown of 20 genes caused a wide range of regeneration phenotypes and that RNAi of the forkhead transcription factor <i>FoxA</i>, which is expressed in a subpopulation of stem cells, specifically inhibited regrowth of the pharynx. Selective amputation of the pharynx therefore permits the identification of genes required for organ-specific regeneration and suggests an ancient function for FoxA-dependent transcriptional programs in driving regeneration."

To ensure that treatment with sodium azide did not alter normal regeneration processes in planaria, Adler et al. carried out manual amputation of tissue in sodium azide-treated flatworms; regeneration in these flatworms was identical to that seen in untreated planaria."

This regenerative capacity depends on a population of stem cells termed neoblasts (<a href=\"#bib61\">Reddien and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2004</a>).

Heterogeneity has been observed molecularly by gene expression-profiling of neoblasts purified via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hayashi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Shibata et al., 2012</a>). Functional evidence of such heterogeneity is supported by single-cell transplantation experiments in which some, but not all, stem cells can repopulate and rescue animals lacking stem cells (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wagner et al., 2011</a>). However, it is unclear what percentage of the stem cell population is in fact pluripotent, or if these cells produce lineage-restricted stem cells. Recent studies have also demonstrated that discrete subpopulations of neoblasts express markers of differentiated tissues (<a href=\"#bib71\">Scimone et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lapan and Reddien, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cowles et al., 2013</a>).

Taken together, this novel amputation strategy offers a defined context in which to measure and understand discrete changes in a stem cell population during regeneration."

Within several days the pharynx regenerated, as visualized either in live animals or by hybridization with a pharynx-specific riboprobe (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cebri\u00e0 et al., 2007</a>).

Histological analysis of the anatomical changes that occur during pharynx regeneration confirmed that chemical amputation causes detachment of the pharynx without affecting the intestine (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, white arrows). Within 24 hr of amputation, small, undifferentiated cells accumulate at the entry to the intestine, within the mesenchyme (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, white arrowheads). Two days after amputation, these cells begin to organize, characterized by a layer of ciliated epithelial cells, a concentration of neurons, and a subepidermal muscle layer (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Three days after amputation the lumenal connection to the intestine has been restored, radial symmetry has been re-established, and most genes expressed in the mature pharynx are present, including the secreted Frizzled-related protein <i>sFRP-1</i>, ciliary dynein heavy chain <i>DNAH-\u03b23</i>, and two members of the Nou Darake family of FGF-receptor-like proteins <i>ndk</i> and <i>ndl-3</i> (<a href=\"#bib68\">Rink et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

To test the possibility that sodium azide broadly compromised regenerative potential, we performed transverse amputations in sodium azide. After washout, wound healing occurred normally, indicating that animals recovered rapidly from sodium azide treatment. Furthermore, in these regenerating fragments, the mitotic profile triggered by amputation during the early phase of regeneration was indistinguishable from controls (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</a>).

Because chemical amputation produces an internal wound but leaves the epithelium intact, we wondered whether it would elicit similar proliferation kinetics to other types of surgically-induced wounds. We quantified the number of mitoses in the animal during pharynx regeneration by staining planarians with an antibody recognizing phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 10 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hendzel et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Newmark and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2000</a>). In the first 24 hr after amputation, we observed a sharp but transient decrease in overall mitotic activity (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), presumably due to the metabolic suppression effects of sodium azide. Overall, body-wide mitotic activity did not significantly change as regeneration progressed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). However, mitotic activity in the vicinity of the wound site appeared to increase 24 hr after amputation, although this effect diminished as regeneration proceeded. To confirm this observation, we quantified mitoses in each of two defined regions: one around the wound site and one posterior to the wound site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, example in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Indeed, we found a significant enrichment of mitotic nuclei around the pharynx wound site, indicating that the proliferative response induced by pharynx removal generates a sufficiently powerful signal to induce and maintain proliferation where regeneration is necessary."

The RNAi screen identified eight genes that exhibited phenotypes consistent with a general function in stem cells. In addition to causing a strong inhibition of feeding and pharynx regeneration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), knockdown of these eight genes severely compromised regeneration (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and decreased mitotic activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Moreover, in situ hybridization for these transcripts demonstrated that they were expressed primarily in stem cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These genes include ribonucleotide reductase (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">B\u00f6ser et al., 2013</a>), the chromatin assembly factor Rbbp4 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bonuccelli et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Wagner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zeng et al., 2013</a>), the G1/S-specific cyclin D1 (<a href=\"#bib86\">Zhu and Pearson, 2013</a>), the zinc finger-containing protein <i>zmym-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib80\">Wagner et al., 2012</a>) and the RuvB DNA helicase (<a href=\"#bib37\">Labb\u00e9 et al., 2012</a>). Three other genes in this group have not been previously implicated in stem cell function in planarians. These genes include the DNA licensing factor MCM7, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 3 (CPSF-3), and the Sumo-activating enzyme subunit 2 (SAE-2). Interestingly, SAE-2 was recently identified as a component of the stem cell proteome (<a href=\"#bib8\">B\u00f6ser et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, our screen captured phenotypes for novel stem cell genes, indicating that this strategy can successfully identify genes acting at discrete and early steps in the process of regeneration."

The inability to feed was most pronounced following knockdown of the Forkhead transcription factor <i>FoxA</i> and the heterogeneous nuclear protein <i>hnRNPK</i>. Other genes that caused strong pharynx phenotypes included the poly-A binding protein PABP-2, a component of the ubiquitin proteasome COP9 signalosome complex (COP9), two WD-repeat containing proteins (WDR3 and WDR36), the ER membrane protein jagunal, and decaprenyl diphosphate synthase subunit 2 (DDSS-2). Overall, mitotic activity of the RNAi knockdown animals in this group was comparable to controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), indicating that these genes were unlikely to affect general stem cell function. However, <i>PABP-2(RNAi)</i> animals exhibited elevated mitotic activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), a phenotype observed in <i>EGFR1(RNAi)</i> and <i>p53(RNAi)</i> animals (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fraguas et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pearson and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2010</a>) and reflecting a failure of proliferative control of the stem cell population."

To accomplish successful feeding after pharynx amputation, animals need to retain the ability to properly sense food and move towards it. Because our screening strategy relied on feeding behavior, it allowed for the discovery of genes required for motility, chemosensation, or other defects in organ function that do not accompany obvious morphological defects. Indeed, we uncovered several genes in this category, including the immediate early gene fos-1, the SMAD protein Madd4, the RNA-binding protein SART-3, and a novel protein. Following knockdown, these animals regenerated pharynges indistinguishable from controls at the morphological level, and had normal levels of mitotic activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>). None of these knockdown animals exhibited motility problems, raising the possibility that these genes may be required for sensory function or for proper integration of the newly regenerated pharynx with the rest of the animal."

Pairing selective amputation of the pharynx with expression of progenitor markers in the stem cell population allows us to begin addressing this question.

Indeed, following pharynx removal, the percentage of <i>FoxA</i><sup>+</sup><i>smedwi-1</i><sup>+</sup> cells increased significantly, with the peak occurring 3 days after pharynx removal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). This result demonstrates that a specific, <i>FoxA</i><sup>+</sup> portion of the stem cell population responded to pharynx removal. Interestingly, when small fragments lacking a pharynx initiate regeneration (i.e., from head or tail amputation), they rapidly increase <i>FoxA</i> expression in the pharynx rudiment (<a href=\"#bib36\">Koinuma et al., 2000</a>). Therefore, mesenchymal cells, even those residing in the anterior or posterior extremes of the animal, can be stimulated to express <i>FoxA</i> when regeneration of a pharynx is required."

To explore whether planarian <i>FoxA</i> is expressed throughout the regenerating pharynx, we performed double fluorescent in situ hybridization with markers for known subsets of pharyngeal cell types (muscle, neurons and epithelial cells). 3 days after amputation, when the pharynx has regenerated its cylindrical structure with regularly arrayed muscle fibers and concentrated neurons at its distal tip (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), <i>FoxA</i> was strongly expressed in the epithelial cells and only weakly in the muscle cells and neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

                    "text": "This manuscript by Adler et al. describes the results of an elegant screen for genes required for organ regeneration in planaria. The authors have developed a clever scheme to chemically amputate the planarian pharynx, thereby standardizing the organ's removal and permitting regeneration assays to be conducted on a relatively large scale. These assays have a straightforward, quantitative readout: animals that regenerate a functional pharynx are able to ingest food (dyed to monitor food intake). The authors characterize the cell biology underlying pharynx regeneration, showing that it requires the animal's stem cells, and they identify changes in gene expression that occur during the initial three days of pharynx regeneration. Targeting a subset of genes that are differentially expressed during the early stages of pharynx regeneration, the authors perform an RNA interference screen to identify genes required for this process. Of the 356 genes they screened, they find 20 in which knockdown leads to defects in pharynx regeneration, by perturbing either stem cell function, pharyngeal morphogenesis, or more specific aspects of pharyngeal function (i.e., a pharynx is formed, but it does not function properly). Focusing their efforts on a forkhead transcription factor homolog, FoxA, the authors show that this gene is required specifically for regeneration of the pharynx. In addition to its expression in the pharynx, FoxA is expressed in a subset of <i>smedwi-1+</i> neoblasts, providing additional evidence for lineage commitment within this cell population."

In the revised version, we have added several WISH experiments interrogating the cellular composition of this dorsal outgrowth. In particular, our experiments confirmed the absence of pharyngeal tissue using two specific markers (<i>laminin and npp-1</i>) in all animals examined. By H&amp;E; staining, the dorsal outgrowth lacks any apparent radial or laminar structure characteristic of the intact pharynx. Often, this outgrowth is densely populated with muscle and neuronal tissue. Furthermore, FoxA expression remains strongly inhibited at these late time points, eliminating the possibility that restoration of FoxA expression drives formation of this outgrowth. We have included this data in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1</a>."
