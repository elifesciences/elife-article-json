While their role is not fully understood, they are believed to control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by means of the nuclear retention of mRNA containing in their 3\u2019-UTR inverted repeats of Alu sequences (IRAlu). In this study, we found that, in pituitary cells, all components of paraspeckles including four major proteins and Neat1 displayed a circadian expression pattern. Furthermore the insertion of IRAlu at the 3\u2019-UTR of the EGFP cDNA led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA that was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted whereas insertion of a single antisense Alu had only a weak effect. Using real-time video-microscopy, these IRAlu were further shown to drive a circadian expression of EGFP protein. This study shows that paraspeckles, thanks to their circadian expression, control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level."

While their role is not fully understood, they are believed to control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by means of the nuclear retention of mRNA containing in their 3\u2019-UTR inverted repeats of Alu sequences (IRAlu). In this study, we found that, in pituitary cells, all components of paraspeckles including four major proteins and Neat1 displayed a circadian expression pattern. Furthermore the insertion of IRAlu at the 3\u2019-UTR of the EGFP cDNA led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA that was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted whereas insertion of a single antisense Alu had only a weak effect. Using real-time video-microscopy, these IRAlu were further shown to drive a circadian expression of EGFP protein. This study shows that paraspeckles, thanks to their circadian expression, control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level."

Genes are first copied or \u2018transcribed' into intermediate molecules called messenger RNAs (mRNAs). These mRNA molecules must then travel out of the cell\u2019s nucleus before they can be de-coded to produce proteins. This means that daily fluctuations in mRNA and protein levels could occur because the rate at which the DNA is transcribed fluctuates or because controlling the steps that occur after transcription. However it is not clear how much these post-transcriptional steps contribute to circadian rhythms inside cells."

Circadian rhythms are underpinned by daily rhythms of gene expression. The transcriptional component of these rhythms is well understood (<a href=\"#bib41\">Zhang and Kay, 2010</a>). The circadian variation in abundance of the positive (Clock and Bmal1) and the negative (Per1, Per2 and Cry1, Cry2) components of these loops drive the circadian transcription of both direct targets genome-wide and a cascade of circadian output transcription factors, which together mediate the circadian transcriptional profile of a cell type or tissue (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asher and Schibler, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Rey et al., 2011</a>). Though the core circadian system has concentrated on transcriptional control, it has been apparent that substantial regulation is achieved after transcription so that post-transcriptional controls are emerging as crucial modulators of circadian clocks (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lim and Allada, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Menet et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Koike et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hurley et al., 2014</a>). While in eukaryotes, approximately 1%-10% genes are subjected to circadian control directly or indirectly only ~1/5 of the mRNAs that display rhythmic expression are directly driven by transcription, which suggests that post-transcriptional mechanisms including RNA splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA stability, mRNA cytoplasmic export and RNAs nuclear retention are essential layers for generation of gene expression rhythmicity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Partch et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Menet et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Koike et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hurley et al., 2014</a>)."

One long noncoding RNA, nuclear-enriched abundant transcript one (Neat1), exclusively localized to paraspeckles serves as a structural component (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hutchinson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen and Carmichael, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Clemson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sasaki and Hirose, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sunwoo et al., 2009</a>).

In human cells, hundreds of genes contain inverted repeated SINEs (mainly Alu elements) in their 3\u2019-UTRs. Alu elements are unique to primates and account for almost all of the human SINEs and &gt;10% of the genome. Their abundance leads to the frequent occurrence of inverted repeat structures (inverted repeated Alu elements [IRAlus]) in gene regions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2008</a>). It has been reported previously that mRNAs containing IRAlus in their 3\u2019-UTRs like Nicolin 1 (NICN1) or Lin 28 are retained in the nucleus in paraspeckles (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen and Carmichael, 2008</a>).

We used this cell line to determine whether one of the posttranscriptional mechanisms allowing circadian gene expression in pituitary cells could involve the\u00a0circadian nuclear mRNA retention by paraspeckle bodies. To this end, we first characterized the presence of paraspeckles and we showed that these nuclear bodies were rhythmically expressed in the rat GH4C1 pituitary cell line. We then made a series of EGFP-fused IRAlu or Alu constructs and transfected them into GH4C1 cells to investigate the\u00a0EGFP expression and the fates of the egfp-IRAlu or egfp-Alu RNA. We showed that an IRAlu element in the 3\u2019-UTR of the egfp mRNA strongly repressed EGFP expression. Further, this reduction was accompanied by significant nuclear retention of the mRNAs, likely by paraspeckle bodies. We showed also that insertion of IRAlus in the 3\u2019-UTR of EGFP reporter gene allowed rhythmic nuclear egfp-IRAlu RNA retention and rhythmic EGFP protein expression. Finally, this rhythmic nuclear egfp-IRAlu RNA retention as well as the rhythmic nuclear retention of some known cycling transcripts that were shown here associated with paraspeckles was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted."

Due to the poor resolution, the size of the paraspeckles was imprecise and could not be measured under conventional fluorescence microscope (red staining). By contrast, dimensions could be precisely measured under STORM (bottom panel of the right part in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In addition to the precision in the real size of paraspeckle bodies, super-resolution analysis allowed also to show that Neat1 labeling of paraspeckle bodies was not round in shape, being merely elliptical.

The single antisense Alu, or the IRAlu elements cloned from the 3\u2019-UTR of NICN1 were inserted each between the EGFP cDNA 3\u2019-UTR region and the SV40 polyadenylation signal of the expression vector pEGFP-C1 to generate constructs that were then stably transfected into GH4C1 cells. In agreement with previous results by Chen et al (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen and Carmichael, 2008</a>), the IRAlu elements derived from NICN1 significantly reduced EGFP expression when compared with the Alu element (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>).

Given that egfp mRNA cytoplasmic localization correlates strongly with EGFP expression, we confirmed in our cell lines that after fractionating cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAs, IRAlu-containing egfp mRNA appeared to be preferentially retained in the nucleus in comparison with Alu-containing egfp mRNA. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, the IRAlu from Nicn1 caused a more than two-fold greater nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA when compared with the corresponding Alu element. On the other hand, there is no significant difference in nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of egfp-Alu mRNA compared with control (data not shown), consistent with our finding that a single Alu element in the 3\u2019-UTR does not affect EGFP gene expression. It then appears that nuclear retention of IRAlu-containing egfp mRNA correlates with silencing of EGFP protein expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>)."

To answer this question, we adapted a pull-down Neat1 technology from two published approaches (RIA (RNA-interactome analysis) and CHART (Capture Hybridization Analysis of RNA Targets) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kretz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Simon, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">West et al., 2014</a>). This technology was based on an affinity purification of Neat1 RNA together with its protein partners and mRNA targets by using oligonucleotides that are complementary to Neat1 RNA sequences. In our adapted technology, anti-sense oligonucleotides were designed in stretches of Neat1 RNA available for hybridization and not occluded by in silico predicted secondary structure (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). With this strategy, we found that two anti-sense oligonucleotides allowed a 30 to 40-fold enrichment in Neat1 RNA compared to Neat1 RNA input from cross-linked GH4C1 cellular extracts (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We performed Neat1 RNA pull-down using these two specific biotinylated complementary oligonucleotides that target Neat1 and one biotynylated irrelevant probe in cell lines stably expressing Alu-containing egfp mRNA or IRAlu-containing egfp mRNA. While one of the specific oligonucleotide (S oligo 2) is more efficient than the other (S oligo 1) to pull-down Neat1, the enrichment in Neat1 was not statistically different in the two Alu-egfp and IRAlu-egfp cell lines (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). By contrast, the amounts of egfp mRNA retrieved after Neat1 RNA pull-down by the two specific probes compared to the non-specific probe were significantly higher in IRAlu-egfp compared to Alu-egfp cell line (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). This result clearly showed that IRAlu-egfp mRNA was preferentially associated with Neat1-containing paraspeckles compared to Alu-egfp mRNA."

Neat1 has been previously shown by others to be effectively knocked down by siRNA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen and Carmichael, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Clemson et al., 2009</a>), and we indeed verified by RT-qPCR that Neat1 RNA levels were reduced in IRAlu-egfp cell line to around 60% after treatment with specific siRNA compared to negative control siRNA, a decrease that was comparable to that obtained with Neat1 ASO (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>); more importantly, whereas Neat1 rhythmic expression pattern was not affected by negative control (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), it was suppressed both by Neat1 siRNA and Neat1 ASO (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). In addition, when IRAlu-egfp cells were transfected either by Neat1 siRNA or Neat1 ASO as compared to negative control, the relative ratio of nuclear versus cytoplasmic egfp mRNA levels was significantly decreased (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Moreover, whereas the circadian egfp mRNA nuclear retention was not affected after transfection of the cells by the\u00a0negative control (not shown), it was abolished after both Neat1 siRNA and Neat1 ASO transfection (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These loss of function experiments showed that the IRAlu-egfp reporter does not cycle when paraspeckles are disrupted."

Only transcripts which exhibited values of fragment per kilobase per million of mapped reads (FPKM) higher than 1 were taken into account.

To allow comparison between gene lists generated from different species, namely rat and mouse, we used only official gene symbols (3928 genes in our 4268 gene list if we consider only official gene symbols). We first compared the mouse pituitary circadian transcriptome previously published (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hughes et al., 2007</a>) with our data set of Neat1 RNA targets. It appeared that 68 genes out of 362 from the list of pituitary circadian transcripts (18.8% ) were found to be included in our data set (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We then tried to assess whether genes known to be post-transcriptional cyclers are associated with paraspeckles. To this end, we compared the list of putative post-transcriptional cycling transcripts established by Menet et al. (<a href=\"#bib25\">Menet et al., 2012</a>) in the mouse liver with our list of Neat1 RNA targets. Although these two lists have been established in two different tissues from two different species, it appeared that 182 genes out of 675 from the list of post-transcriptional circadian genes in the liver (27%) were found to be included in our data set (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In agreement with the assumption that rhythmic circadian genes are tissue specific, we found very few genes (24 genes) common to the list of Hughes et al.

With this aim, we chose among Neat1 RNA targets, six genes that were included either in the list of Menet et al.

First we verified by qPCR the specific association of the seven selected genes with Neat1. To this end, we determined the enrichment in these seven mRNA obtained after Neat1 RNA pull-down with the two specific biotinylated complementary oligonucleotides that target Neat1 compared to the biotinylated irrelevant probe. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, the seven selected genes were significantly enriched after Neat1 RNA pull-down by the two specific probes compared to the non-specific probe. We further found that the seven selected genes displayed a rhythmic pattern of nuclear retention in IRAlu-egfp cells since values obtained for their relative mRNA ratio between nucleoplasm and cytoplasm over the time can be fitted by a sine wave curve with a R squared &gt;0.55 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 2</a>).

Four RNA-binding proteins, including three members of the Drosophila melanogaster behavior human splicing (DBHS) family proteins (NONO, PSPC1 and SFPQ) and RNA-binding motif protein 14 (RBM14) are classified as 'classical' paraspeckle protein components (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bond and Fox, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Prasanth et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fox et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Nakagawa and Hirose, 2012</a>). Both endogenous and tagged forms of these proteins are found localized within the nucleoplasm as well as paraspeckles in mammalian cells. With a confocal fluorescent study, we report in a rat pituitary cell line that all four paraspeckle protein components are distributed both in the nucleoplasm and in subnuclear foci. Among these later, we identify paraspeckle nuclear bodies by overlapping side-by-side the staining of two paraspeckle protein components. This allows not only to provide evidence for the existence of paraspeckles in rat pituitary cell nuclei but also to show that as already reported in other cell types, paraspeckles are small, irregularly sized and unevenly distributed subnuclear bodies. Using RIP experiments, we further show that all four paraspeckle protein components are associated with the specific paraspeckle localized lncRNA Neat1. This later is further detected by RNA FISH. Confirming previous reports in other cell types, when identified by a combination of Neat1 RNA FISH and confocal microscopy, paraspeckles appear as round foci in rat pituitary cells. The diameter of such round foci is in the range of that estimated in previous studies (around 360 nm). However after use of a combination of Neat1 RNA FISH and STORM analysis, paraspeckles appear more likely as oblong structures with smaller dimensions reminiscent of the interchromatin granule-associated zone (IGAZ) that had been observed under electron microscope and had been reported to correspond to paraspeckles (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cardinale et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bond and Fox, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Souquere et al., 2010</a>). Width and height measurements obtained after STORM analysis of Neat1 RNA FISH staining are smaller than the dimensions of IGAZ nuclear bodies established by an electron microscopy analysis in human and mouse cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Souquere et al., 2010</a>) suggesting that either IGAZ/paraspeckle nuclear bodies are smaller in rat than in mouse cells or alternatively and more likely, Neat1 RNA staining does not fill in all the nuclear bodies as already proposed (<a href=\"#bib34\">Souquere et al., 2010</a>)."

Furthermore, all four proteins bind rhythmically to Neat1, suggesting that the pools of proteins involved in paraspeckle composition vary with time. In addition, the lncRNA Neat1 itself displays a circadian expression pattern and we further found using a pair of primers allowing the specific detection of the long form of Neat1 RNA, Neat1-2 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>) that the expression of this form known to be sufficient for the formation of paraspeckle displays a circadian pattern (data not shown). The circadian expression pattern of Neat1 RNA is not the privilege of 'in vitro' pituitary cells since it is also found 'ex vivo' in several mouse tissues including the pituitary gland but also numerous other peripheral oscillators such as the spleen or the adrenal gland. This holds also true for the central clock, namely the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Finally, in GH4C1 cells, the circadian variations in Neat1 RNA levels are shown here to reflect rhythmic variations in paraspeckle number within the cells. It may then be assumed that the circadian expression pattern of Neat1 RNA described here in a number of mouse tissue also reflects variations in paraspeckle number although it cannot be excluded that paraspeckle size could also oscillate over the circadian period both in pituitary cells and in other oscillators."

While PSPC1 as well as NONO and SFPQ accumulate in paraspeckles, these proteins are also found elsewhere throughout the nucleoplasm and thus may have functions apart from paraspeckle retention. In contrast to paraspeckle-associated proteins that are multifunctional, NEAT1 may have only one function. We then developed a technique to characterize nuclear mRNA Neat1 targets using a Neat1 RNA pull-down approach that allowed us to show the association of IRAlu egfp mRNA with Neat1 providing a much more convincing evidence for a nuclear retention of IRAlu egfp mRNA by paraspeckles."

In keeping with this view, we showed that IRAlu elements inserted in 3\u2019-UTR of egfp reporter mRNA allow for its circadian retention within the nucleus and consequently for EGFP protein circadian expression. However, it may be noticed that egfp mRNA displayed also a circadian nuclear retention when a single antisens Alu element was inserted in its 3\u2019-UTR but in this case the variations of the ratio over the circadian period was highly reduced in contrast to the high amplitude circadian variations of the nuclear versus cytoplasmic ratio observed in IRAlu-egfp cell line. These small amplitude variations of the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA contents in Alu-egfp cell line were further accompanied by a weak number of cells expressing a circadian pattern of EGFP expression. Since antisens Alu elements within the 3\u2019-UTR of mRNAs can be the target of several RNA-binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kelley et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Zarnack et al., 2013</a>) it may be speculated that some of these RNA-binding proteins display a rhythmic expression pattern accounting for the weak EGFP circadian expression observed in Alu-egfp cell line. Among the identified RNA-binding proteins that target antisens Alu elements within the 3\u2019-UTR of mRNAs, HNRNPC was shown to display a circadian expression pattern in several tissues including the mouse pituitary (see CIRCA: <a href=\"http://circadb.hogeneschlab.org/\">http://circadb.hogeneschlab.org/</a>). This is not the case for HNRNPU and STAUFEN 1 (STAU1)-mediated messenger RNA decay we did not find to display a circadian expression pattern in GH4C1 cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Guillaumond et al., 2011</a>) and (data not shown) and are then unlikely involved in circadian EGFP expression in Alu-egfp cell line. The mechanism involved in the circadian nuclear retention of Alu-containing egfp mRNA remains anyway to be determined."

To determine whether this paraspeckle impact on rhythmic gene expression occurs 'in vivo' on a much larger scale, we characterized in our pituitary cells the list of the putative Neat1 RNA target genes and we analyzed in publicly available datasets the known cycling transcripts that are included in this Neat1 RNA target list. Whereas it is well known that rhythmic circadian genes are tissue specific and that it is unfavorable to compare datasets obtained in two different species we found a robust overlap of our gene list with circadian genes in the mouse pituitary (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hughes et al., 2007</a>) and a closer overlap with post-transcriptional circadian genes in the mouse liver (<a href=\"#bib25\">Menet et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, on a few circadian genes common to either of these lists or both, we showed a loss of rhythmic pattern when paraspeckles were disrupted assuming that paraspeckle retention plays a relevant role in circadian gene expression. It is now widely admitted that post-transcriptional circadian regulation plays a major role in determining oscillations at the mRNA level. In agreement with this view, the new mechanism described here suggests that circadian mRNA oscillations could be post-transcriptionally controlled through rhythmic nuclear retention by paraspeckle nuclear bodies."

A reference conventional fluorescence image of the cell of interest was acquired before recording storm sequence of images. For super resolution image acquisition, the sample stained with Quasar 670 dye was excited by a 647\u00a0nm imaging laser. Illumination with 405 nm light was gradually increased along recording to reactivate Quasar 670 blinking. The fluorescence emission was separated from the excitation light by adapted dichroic mirror (660 nm) and filters (692/4 nm) and collected on an IXon EMCCD camera (Andor Technology, Belfast, UK).

Additional experiments need to be done before this manuscript is acceptable for publication (see below)."

First, the paper illustrates that paraspeckles are found in pituitary GH4C1 cells and that they contain known protein components as well the long non-coding RNA Neat1. All of these components are rhythmically expressed. The authors use Neat1 FISH combined with STORM to obtain a clear view of a paraspeckle body and estimate its size. Previous studies indicated that transcripts with a IRAlu element in their 3'-UTRs are retained in paraspeckles (Chen et al. 2008). The same results were obtained here. Adding an IRAlu element to the 3'-UTR of a GFP reporter led to its retention in paraspeckles. Finally, and most importantly, retention of the GFP reporter in paraspeckles led to the oscillation of EGFP protein expression."

This is an important experiment because it directly tests whether the retention of mRNAs in paraspeckles can drive oscillating protein expression. Additional experiments need to be done before this manuscript is acceptable for publication (see comments below)."

Leveraging on the several recent papers showing that post-transcriptional events significantly contribute to rhythmic gene expression, this paper submitted by the research team of Anne-Marie Fran\u00e7ois-Bellan examines the role of paraspeckles in the regulation of circadian gene expression using mostly GH4C1 cells in vitro (a rat pituitary-derived cell line). The authors first show that the expression of the 4 major paraspeckles proteins and Neat1, as well as their interactions, are rhythmic in entrained GH4C1 cells. Based on published results showing that mRNAs containing inverted repeated Alu elements (IRAlus) are retained in paraspeckles, the authors then test if mRNAs containing these IRAlus can be subjected to paraspeckles-mediated rhythmic post-transcriptional regulation. To this end, the authors developed a strategy using egfp mRNA fused to IRAlus (or just Alus as controls), and showed that rhythmic paraspeckles expression rhythmically impacts on the nuclear retention and protein expression of egfp when fused to IRAlus."

The authors could have easily used some publicly available datasets and for example assessed in the genes \"labeled\" as post-transcriptional cyclers harbors more IRAlus in their 3'UTR.

Given the unique Neat1 RNA nuclear localization, RNA knockdown is more convenient than paraspeckle protein depletion for investigating paraspeckle function. Furthermore since there is an essentially perfect relationship between loss of paraspeckles and depletion of Neat1 RNA (Clemson et al., 2009), we addressed this issue by using Neat1 siRNA and Neat1 antisens oligonucleotides (ASO). By RT-qPCR we showed that Neat1 RNA levels were reduced in IRAlu-egfp cell line to around 60% after treatment with specific siRNA compared to negative control siRNA (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The reduction we obtained in Neat1 RNA levels using siRNA is modest but comparable to that reported in human Hela cells (Clemson et al., 2009; Gagnon et al., 2014) and since in FISH experiments we do not find evidence for Neat1 RNA in the cytoplasm, this is consistent with other findings that RNA inhibition using siRNA can effectively occur in the nucleus (Langlois et al., 2005; Robb et al., 2005; Valgardsdottir et al., 2005; Clemson et al., 2009; Gagnon et al., 2014). Furthermore, the decrease in Neat1 RNA levels was not amplified when we used Neat1 ASO to disrupt paraspeckles siRNA (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In any case, treatment with Neat1 siRNA and Neat1 ASO disrupts the circadian expression pattern of Neat1 RNA siRNA (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). More importantly, when IRAlu-egfp cells were transfected either by Neat1 siRNA or Neat1 ASO as compared to negative control, the relative ratio of nuclear versus cytoplasmic egfp mRNA levels was significantly decreased (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and the circadian egfp nuclear retention was abolished (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

As discussed by (Simon, 2015), an alternative method that controls for off-target RNA is to use two independent capture oligonucleotides that bind the target RNA. Specific signals are expected to be found with both oligonucleotides whereas signals that are found with only one oligonucleotide are interpreted as hybridization-induced artifacts. In our paper, we assessed the specificity of Neat 1 RNA pull-down by crossing the FPKM&gt;1-limited lists obtained with two specific oligonucleotides."

Thereby to convincingly show that transcripts from Neat1 RNA pull-down sequencing are specific Neat1 RNA targets, we verified by qPCR the specific association of a few of them with Neat1. To this end, we determined for the seven mRNA already selected in our paper, the enrichment obtained after Neat1 RNA pull-down with the two specific biotinylated complementary oligonucleotides that target Neat1 compared to the biotinylated irrelevant probe. As reported in the Results section and shown in a new figure supplement (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), the seven selected genes were significantly enriched after Neat1 RNA pull-down by the two specific probes compared to the non-specific probe."

The authors also show similar data for several endogenous genes (Canx, Fkbp4 and Calr; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B-D</a>; 4 other genes in supplementary data).

The reviewer is right to state that this time interval does not allow determining the precise value of the period and phase of the rhythm, but this was not the aim of the experiment. Our purpose was to test whether or not the seven selected genes exhibited a circadian nuclear retention (by definition with a period comprised between 20h and 28h), and whether the minimum value of this rhythm occurred roughly when the levels of paraspeckle protein components and Neat1 RNA were the lowest. We indeed found for the seven selected genes 1/ that the relative mRNA ratio between nucleoplasm and cytoplasm over the time can be fitted by a sine wave curve with a R squared &gt; 0.55 attesting its circadian nature and 2/ that the rhythms were approximately in phase with paraspeckle component rhythms. Furthermore, while having different effects on expression levels, we also found that both siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides were able to disrupt these rhythms attesting that paraspeckles are involved in the circadian nuclear retention of these mRNA."
