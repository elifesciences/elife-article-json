Direct damage to DNA or errors in the processes that generate messenger RNA (mRNA) from the DNA template can introduce mutations, with potentially harmful consequences. \u2018Nonsense\u2019 mutations are particularly problematic: they are associated with many genetically inherited diseases, such as the blood disorder \u03b2-thalassaemia, and are common in cancer (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bhuvanagiri et al., 2010</a>). To reduce the impact of these mutations, eukaryotic cells have evolved methods known as nonsense-mediated decay (or NMD for short) to destroy mutant mRNA molecules. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Ligang Wu and co-workers at the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences\u2014including Ya Zhao as the first author\u2014report a new mechanism of nonsense-mediated decay that is driven by microRNAs, an important family of regulatory molecules (<a href=\"#bib10\">Zhao et al., 2014</a>)."

Nonsense mutations introduce a stop codon \u2018upstream\u2019 of the correct signal so that translation is stopped early and a truncated protein is made. Truncations can interfere with normal protein function in various ways: if a regulatory region is lost, the protein may be over-active; the shortened non-functional proteins can also displace functional versions of the same protein from multi-protein complexes."

Zhao et al. used a series of elegant experiments to confirm this hypothesis, and, in doing so, identified a new method of nonsense-mediated decay that is directed by microRNAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). First, Zhao et al. inserted a microRNA binding site into the coding region of an mRNA. This had no effect on the mRNA, confirming the prevailing view that microRNA regulation does not occur efficiently in coding regions (<a href=\"#bib5\">Gu et al., 2009</a>). However, when Zhao et al. introduced a nonsense codon so that the microRNA site was now located in the 3\u2032UTR, microRNAs could bind to it, which induced mRNA decay (<a href=\"#bib10\">Zhao et al., 2014</a>)."

The <i>APC</i> gene was a particularly good choice for this study as most of its nonsense mutations occur in a hotspot within the last exon, so that they are not recognized by the exon junction complex method of nonsense-mediated decay (<a href=\"#bib8\">Miyoshi et al., 1992</a>). However, Zhao et al. found that nonsense mutations in this region expose microRNA binding sites within the newly-formed 3\u2032UTR, which leads to the decay of mRNA copied from the <i>APC</i> gene. Finally, Zhao et al. used reporter genes based on the breast cancer-associated tumour suppressor gene <i>BRCA1</i>, which is sensitive to the EJC form of nonsense-mediated decay, to show that the exon junction complex and microRNA mechanisms of nonsense-mediated decay can both work on the same mRNA (<a href=\"#bib10\">Zhao et al., 2014</a>)."

In contrast to EJC nonsense-mediated decay, microRNA regulation tends to be fairly weak (<a href=\"#bib6\">Leung and Sharp, 2010</a>). However, multiple microRNA sites function cooperatively, so the level of microRNA nonsense-mediated decay is likely to be strongly influenced by the number and the identity of the microRNA sites revealed by a nonsense mutation. In addition, microRNA expression is highly regulated during development and in certain tissues, as well as in cancers, suggesting that microRNA-mediated nonsense-mediated decay is also likely to be tightly regulated."

By regulating the proteins involved in exon junction complex nonsense-mediated decay, microRNAs can influence how the decay proceeds (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bruno et al., 2011</a>). Additionally, a new study has shown that microRNA binding can create a suitable target for EJC nonsense-mediated decay by changing how the ribosome reads a specific mRNA molecule (<i>CCR5</i>, which encodes a protein used by many forms of HIV to invade cells; <a href=\"#bib1\">Belew et al., 2014</a>). Overall, it seems that the complexity of how the cell deals with nonsense mutations and how microRNAs are involved is only beginning to be revealed."
