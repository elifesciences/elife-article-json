How this harmonization is achieved is not known. In this study, we found that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor synaptotagmin 1 orchestrates the membrane association/disassociation cycle of Rab3, which functions in activity-dependent recruitment of synaptic vesicles. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, synaptotagmin 1 binds to Rab3 GTPase activating protein (GAP) and inhibits the GTP hydrolysis of Rab3 protein. Rab3 GAP resides on synaptic vesicles, and synaptotagmin 1 is essential for the synaptic localization of Rab3 GAP. In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, synaptotagmin 1 releases Rab3 GAP and promotes membrane disassociation of Rab3. Without synaptotagmin 1, the tight coupling between vesicle exocytosis and Rab3 membrane disassociation is disrupted. We uncovered the long-sought molecular apparatus linking vesicle exocytosis to Rab3 cycling and we also revealed the important function of synaptotagmin 1 in repetitive synaptic vesicle release."

A number of the proteins in this docking complex have been identified, including two that have been referred to as the \u2018yin and yang\u2019 of vesicle fusion: synaptotagmin, which promotes fusion, and Rab3, which limits it.

Given that Rab3 (\u2018yang\u2019) requires a molecule of GTP to power its own activity, the actions of synaptotagmin ensure that Rab3 has enough energy to remain bound to other proteins within the docking complex."

As a result, vesicles fuse with the membrane and release neurotransmitter molecules into the synapse."

Fast and precise neuronal reaction requires that SVs are clustered in front of the release site, the presynaptic active zone. SVs then dock at the active zone, where they are primed to adopt a competent \u201cready-for-fusion\u201d state. An action potential induces the opening of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and the rising Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration stimulates SV-plasma membrane fusion. The basic membrane fusion reaction is mediated by evolutionarily conserved soluble NSF attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) and related proteins like Munc13 and Munc18 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Weber et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sudhof, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brunger, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lang and Jahn, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</a>). However, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing process that starts the SNARE engine is primarily carried out by the synaptotagmin family (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chapman, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</a>). Through their C2 domains, synaptotagmins bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, thus triggering membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib53\">Sudhof, 2004</a>). After exocytosis, SVs undergo endocytosis and recycling and are refilled with neurotransmitters for repeated rounds of release."

Like other Rabs, Rab3 cycles on and off its target membranes according to its GTP- or GDP-bound state. On the vesicles, the active GTP-bound form of Rab3 is complexed with effector proteins like rabphilin and RIM (Rab3-interacting molecule) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Shirataki et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Li et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2000</a>), thus facilitating the recruitment/docking of SVs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nonet et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Leenders et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tsuboi and Fukuda, 2006</a>).

The GTP-to-GDP conversion not only removes Rab3 from SVs, but also simultaneously dissociates Rab3 from its binding effectors, which disassembles the docking complex so that both Rab3 and Rab3 effectors can be recycled for the next round of release (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2000</a>). Given their unique features, Rab3 and synaptotagmin have been considered as the Yin and Yang of membrane fusion, respectively (<a href=\"#bib25\">Geppert and S\u00fcdhof, 1998</a>). However, the functional regulatory interaction between synaptotagmin 1 and Rab3 cycling has not been identified nor has the mechanism by which this interaction is coupled to fast and repetitive neurotransmitter release."

SNT-1 promotes the GTP-bound state of RAB-3 by inhibiting RAB-3 GAP. The catalytic subunit of RAB-3 GAP (RBG-1) localizes on SVs and directly binds to SNT-1. Ca<sup>2+</sup> treatment disrupts the direct association between SNT-1 and RBG-1. In addition, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding activity of SNT-1 is essential for the dissociation of RAB-3 from SVs. Thus, our study reveals the pivotal dual role of synaptotagmin 1 in coupling SV exocytosis with the Rab3 membrane association and dissociation cycle."

In the absence of UNC-104 kinesin, few SVs are transported to synaptic termini, while neuron cell bodies have a surfeit of SVs. To further address whether the diffuse RAB-3 phenotype is indeed caused by the dissociation of RAB-3 from SVs in <i>snt-1</i> mutants, we performed a serial mutant analysis utilizing both GFP::RAB-3 and SNB-1::GFP markers. Because the <i>snt-1;unc-104</i> double mutant animals are arrested during larval development, the synaptic phenotypes were examined in newly hatched L1 animals (larval stage 1). In L1 animals, among DD, VD, and AS motor neurons, only DDs are born (<a href=\"#bib54\">Sulston, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</a>), and they form pre-synapses along the ventral cord. Thus, in wild-type L1 animals labeled by P<i>unc-25</i>::SNB-1::GFP, the GFP signal could only be detected along the ventral cord (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,C\u2033</a>) but not the dorsal cord (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C'</a>). In <i>snt-1</i> mutants, the SNB-1::GFP distribution is indistinguishable from wild type (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,D', and 2D\u2033</a>). In <i>unc-104</i> single mutants, we found that SNB-1::GFP accumulated in cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,E\u2033</a>, white arrow) and little GFP signal could be detected outside of cell bodies or on the dorsal cord (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E'</a>), which is consistent with the role of UNC-104 in SV transport. In <i>snt-1;unc-104</i> double mutants, the SNB-1::GFP signal accumulated in cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,F\u2033</a>, white arrow) like in <i>unc-104</i> single mutants, suggesting that further removal of SNT-1 in <i>unc-104</i> mutant animals does not alter the dependence of SVs on UNC-104 for intracellular trafficking. Interestingly, the effect of <i>snt-1</i> or <i>snt-1 unc-104</i> mutations on RAB-3 and SNB-1 is quite different. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,J</a>, GFP::RAB-3 is still diffuse in cell bodies and axons in both <i>snt-1</i> and <i>snt-1 unc-104</i> animals, and GFP signal could be detected even in the non-synaptic dorsal cord region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H' and 2J'</a>). In contrast, in <i>unc-104</i> animals, the RAB-3 puncta are retained within cell bodies, just like SNB-1 is in <i>unc-104</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I,I\u2033</a>). These data strongly support the notion that the diffuse phenotype of RAB-3 is not caused by the dispersion of SV clusters, but rather by the specific dissociation of RAB-3 from SV membranes."

Previous studies showed that the localization of RAB-3 on SV membranes is tightly associated with its GTP-bound state (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zerial and McBride, 2001</a>). Therefore, we tested whether the loss of RAB-3 from SVs in <i>snt-1</i> mutants is caused by reduction of GTP-bound RAB-3. The active GTP-Rab3 binds to the RBD domain of its effector RIM, while the inactive GDP-Rab3 does not. Previous reports demonstrated that the RBD domain of mammalian RIM2 could bind to the worm GTP-RAB-3 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mahoney et al., 2006</a>). Thus, we performed pull-down assays to examine the GTP-RAB-3 level in vivo. In wild-type worm lysates, the active GTP-bound form of RAB-3 protein was efficiently pulled down by GST-RBD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In contrast, the amount of GTP-RAB-3 pulled down by RIM2 RBD was significantly reduced in <i>snt-1</i> lysates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). In the absence of RAB-3 GEF, the GDP-bound RAB-3 cannot be converted to the GTP-bound RAB-3. Indeed, in <i>aex-3</i> animals, the amount of RAB-3 that can be pulled down by GST-RBD is also greatly decreased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>).

One possibility is that SNT-1 may regulate the RAB-3 GTP-GDP cycle by promoting GEF activity. We performed the following experiments to test this possibility. Firstly, AEX-3 is the GEF molecule for both RAB-3 and RAB-27 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mahoney et al., 2006</a>). If <i>snt-1</i> indeed affects AEX-3 activity, we would expect that the localization of RAB-27 on SVs will be affected by the absence of SNT-1. We made a GFP::RAB-27 reporter and expressed it in motor neurons in worms. The GFP::RAB-27 protein is enriched in synaptic regions and displays a punctate expression pattern similar to RAB-3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In <i>aex-3</i> mutants, GFP::RAB-27 becomes diffuse, consistent with the role of AEX-3 as a GEF for RAB-27 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In contrast, GFP::RAB-27 still displays a punctate distribution indistinguishable from wild type in <i>snt-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), suggesting that the GEF activity of AEX-3, at least for RAB-27, is not altered by mutation of <i>snt-1</i>. Second, if SNT-1 promotes AEX-3 GEF activity, we would expect that increasing the <i>aex-3</i> expression level may rescue the diffuse RAB-3 phenotype in <i>snt-1</i> mutants. However, no such rescue was observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Lastly, we examined the expression level of AEX-3 and found that it was indistinguishable in wild-type and <i>snt-1</i> animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Together, these results suggest that it is unlikely that <i>snt-1</i> regulates the GTP-RAB-3 level by promoting RAB-3 GEF activity."

Rab3 GTPase activity is greatly facilitated by Rab3-specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Rab3 GAP is composed of the catalytic subunit Rab3GAP1 and the noncatalytic subunit Rab3GAP2. <i>rbg-1</i> and <i>rbg-2</i> encode Rab3GAP1 and Rab3GAP2, respectively in worms (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fukui et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nagano et al., 1998</a>).

Indeed, in <i>rbg-1;snt-1</i> double mutants, we found that the diffuse GFP::RAB-3 phenotype of <i>snt-1</i> single mutants is significantly suppressed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Furthermore, mutation of the <i>rbg-2</i> gene also suppressed the diffuse RAB-3 phenotype in <i>snt-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). In contrast, the diffuse GFP::RAB-3 signal caused by <i>aex-3</i> mutation could not be suppressed by <i>rbg-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>).

In contrast to the mock-transfected sample, RBG-1 was effectively co-precipitated with the cytosolic region of SNT-1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The SNT-1 cytosolic portion was also co-precipitated by RBG-1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). We next asked which domain of the SNT-1 cytosolic region is required for this binding. The cytosolic region of SNT-1 contains a C2A and a C2B motif. When the C2A domain was deleted, the remaining C2B motif retained the RBG-1 binding activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In contrast, when C2B was removed, the C2A domain alone could not bind to RBG-1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Therefore, the C2B domain is required for SNT-1 binding to RBG-1."

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the GFP::RAB-3 pattern in transgenic animals that express different mutant forms of SNT-1. The two amino acids necessary for Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding in the C2A domain of SNT-1 are D248 and D250. We created the SNT-1 mutant C2A* by replacing these two aspartic acids with alanines and found that C2A* could rescue the GFP::RAB-3 mis-localization defect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). In addition to this rescue phenomenon, we noticed that the GFP::RAB-3 puncta were enlarged and the GFP signal was more enriched in the punctate regions in comparison to wild-type animals over-expressing <i>snt-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). A similar GFP::RAB-3 enrichment effect was observed in worms expressing the C2B* mutant form of SNT-1, which contains a C2B domain that cannot bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> (D383 and D385 were replaced with alanines) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>).

Because the diffuse RAB-3::GFP signal suggests a dissociation of RAB-3 from SV membranes, the above observation implies that in the absence of SNT-1, the dissociation of RAB-3 from SVs can occur even when Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced exocytosis is blocked. As a consequence, the coupling between SV exocytosis and RAB-3 dissociation is disrupted when SNT-1 is missing. These data are consistent with the inhibition-of-inhibition role of SNT-1 on RAB-3/SV association. Together, these results suggest that SNT-1 plays a dual role in the RAB-3/SV cycle, inhibiting dissociation of RAB-3 from SVs during the resting state (no Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx) and triggering dissociation of RAB-3 from SVs upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>)."

However, Rab3 GAP, the negative regulator of Rab3, is also enriched in the synaptic fraction and is localized on SVs (this study) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Oishi et al., 1998</a>). How therefore is the active form of Rab3, and hence the proper docking complex, maintained when GAP is close by? Based upon our study, it is entirely possible that synaptotagmin 1 prevents the hydrolysis of Rab3 GTP by directly sequestering or inhibiting Rab3 GAP before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. In fact, the SV localization of Rab3GAP1/RBG-1 is particularly interesting, given the fact that the Rab3 cycle must be spatially regulated so that Rab3 is kept in close proximity to SVs for repeated neurotransmitter release. Indeed, when synaptotagmin 1/SNT-1 binds Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the inhibition on RAB-3 GAP is alleviated, so the locally enriched Rab3 GAP can freely and quickly access GTP-Rab3 and hydrolyze Rab3 GTP to GDP. Together with the functional Ca<sup>2+</sup>switch, synaptotagmin 1 can therefore efficiently coordinate the Rab3 cycle with the SV cycle. The concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> needed for exocytosis ranges from \u223c10 to 200 \u00b5M in the nerve terminals, so the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that is required to release RBG-1 from SNT-1 is relatively high (500 \u00b5M).

Therefore, it will be interesting to test whether plasma membrane-enriched lipids such as PIP2 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2010</a>) can act synergistically with Ca<sup>2+</sup> to regulate the binding of SNT-1 to RBG-1."

The interaction of synaptotagmin with membranes and SNARE proteins has well-documented consequences, including creating local positive membrane curvature and displacing the clamping factor complexin from the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib38\">Martens et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hui et al., 2009</a>). Combining these previous reports with data presented in this study, we think that synaptotagmin-Ca<sup>2+</sup> may not only give the final push for complete assembly of the SNARE complex for membrane fusion, but also play a role in terminating vesicle docking by indirectly deactivating Rab3, thus facilitating repetitive transmitter release."

Synaptotagmins have also evolved specifically to regulate secretion. Interestingly, the regulatory role of SNT-1 on RAB-3 does not extend to RAB-27, which is functionally closely related to RAB-3 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mahoney et al., 2006</a>). Simultaneous knockdown of Rab3 and Rab27 causes secretion defects more severe than single knockdown in worms and PC12 cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mahoney et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tsuboi and Fukuda, 2006</a>). Both Rab27 and Rab3 are localized on SVs and can bind to RIM, thereby docking the vesicles (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fukuda, 2003</a>). Rab3 and Rab27 share the same GEF, which is AEX-3 in worms and DENN/MADD in mammals (<a href=\"#bib35\">Levivier et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Coppola et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mahoney et al., 2006</a>). In contrast, Rab3 GAP serves as a specific GAP for Rab3 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fukui et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nagano et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Itoh and Fukuda, 2006</a>). Here, SNT-1 apparently only affects the RAB-3 cycle and this action is mediated by inhibition of the Rab3-specific GAP. Therefore, although Rab3 and Rab27 play redundant roles in SV exocytosis, they can be differentially controlled through their specific regulators. We would like to point out that humans and worms have multiple synaptotagmins, and it remains to be determined whether any of the other synaptotagmins play a similar regulatory role on Rab27."

Rab3GAP1 and Rab3GAP2 form a complex in vitro and co-immunoprecipitate in vivo (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nagano et al., 1998</a>). Although Rab3GAP2 does not affect the in vitro GAP activity of Rab GAP1, it may act to stabilize, regulate, or localize Rab3GAP1 correctly in cells. The functional characteristics are consistent with their close biochemical interactions. Loss-of-function mutations in Rab3GAP1 and Rab3GAP2 produce clinically almost indistinguishable conditions, Warburg Micro syndrome and Martsolf syndrome, characterized by brain, eye, and endocrine abnormalities (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aligianis et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2006</a>). We have now revealed that both Rab3GAP1/<i>rbg-1</i> and Rab3GAP1/<i>rbg-2</i> mutations can suppress the RAB-3 mis-localization phenotype in <i>snt-1</i> mutants, implying that Rab3GAP does indeed function as a complex to participate in the SNT-1-mediated regulation of the RAB-3 cycle. However, we noticed that loss of function of <i>rbg-2</i> alone leads to additional synaptic or axonal defects (data not shown) compared to loss of <i>rab-3</i> or <i>rbg-1</i>. This suggests that RBG-2 may play roles in nervous system development other than forming the Rab3GAP complex with RBG-1 during SV exocytosis."

In contrast with Rab effectors that function in secretory vesicle trafficking, relatively little is known about the specific Rab GEFs and GAPs and how they are regulated during vesicle secretion. Evidence that the sub-cellular localization and activity of RAB-3 GAP can be regulated by synaptotagmin/SNT-1 strongly hints that regulators of Rabs could be subjects for active manipulation during various types of intracellular membrane trafficking. A recent intriguing study is in agreement with our notion. In the amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, vacuolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> release activates the Rab GAP CnrF, thus subsequently down-regulating Rab11a (<a href=\"#bib15\">Donato et al., 2013</a>). Taken together, current data suggest a vital role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the functional switch for regulated secretion processes. Because the key principles and regulatory components of different intracellular vesicle trafficking events are broadly conserved, the mechanism that we have uncovered is likely to represent a conserved mode of action."

Synaptotagmins act as the primary Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensors in most forms of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced exocytosis, as exemplified by synaptic transmission. Our studies have proposed the elegant molecular machinery by which Rab GAP can be temporally and spatially regulated in response to acute cellular signals, so that correctly activated Rabs can perform their appropriate functions and allow vesicle fusion to occur in an orderly fashion."

Therefore, we used two approaches to obtain the <i>snt-1 rab-3</i> double mutant. Firstly, we tried to use CRISPR-Cas9 to mutate the <i>snt-1</i> gene in the <i>rab-3(js49)</i> background. After guidance RNA sequence design, cloning and injection, we obtained 4 heritable transgenic lines. However, PCR and sequence analysis showed that none of the transgenic lines was carrying the corresponding <i>snt-1</i> mutation. Second, we tried to get the <i>snt-1 rab-3</i> recombinant directly. After crossing <i>rab-3(js49)</i> males to <i>snt-1(md290)</i>, from the heterozygote progenies, we obtained a total of 300 <i>snt-1(md290)</i> homozygotes. Among the 300 animals, three were <i>rab-3(js49)</i> heterozygotes. We singled out 72 animals from these three plates. However, PCR and sequencing analysis could not identify any <i>rab-3(js49)</i> homozygote animals, suggesting that the <i>snt-1 rab-3</i> double animals are probably lethal. Indeed, after monitoring the progeny from a single <i>snt-1 rab-3/snt-1 +</i> animal, we found that a quarter of the progeny were arrested at the later larval stage. Thus, the lethality of <i>snt-1 rab-3</i> doubles prevents us from doing the aldicarb assay."
