During motor assembly, \ufb02agellins are transported unfolded through the central channel in the \ufb02agellum to the growing tip. Here, we applied in vivo \ufb02uorescent imaging to monitor in real time the <i>Vibrio alginolyticus</i> polar \ufb02agella growth. The \ufb02agellar growth rate is found to be highly length-dependent. Initially, the \ufb02agellum grows at a constant rate (50 nm/min) when shorter than 1500 nm. The growth rate decays sharply when the \ufb02agellum grows longer, which decreases to ~9 nm/min at 7500 nm. We modeled \ufb02agellin transport inside the channel as a one-dimensional diffusive process with an injection force at its base. When the \ufb02agellum is short, its growth rate is determined by the loading speed at the base. Only when the \ufb02agellum grows longer does diffusion of \ufb02agellin become the rate-limiting step, dramatically reducing the growth rate. Our results shed new light on the dynamic building process of this complex extracellular structure."

During motor assembly, \ufb02agellins are transported unfolded through the central channel in the \ufb02agellum to the growing tip. Here, we applied in vivo \ufb02uorescent imaging to monitor in real time the <i>Vibrio alginolyticus</i> polar \ufb02agella growth. The \ufb02agellar growth rate is found to be highly length-dependent. Initially, the \ufb02agellum grows at a constant rate (50 nm/min) when shorter than 1500 nm. The growth rate decays sharply when the \ufb02agellum grows longer, which decreases to ~9 nm/min at 7500 nm. We modeled \ufb02agellin transport inside the channel as a one-dimensional diffusive process with an injection force at its base. When the \ufb02agellum is short, its growth rate is determined by the loading speed at the base. Only when the \ufb02agellum grows longer does diffusion of \ufb02agellin become the rate-limiting step, dramatically reducing the growth rate. Our results shed new light on the dynamic building process of this complex extracellular structure."

Scale Bars, 500 nm (and 200 nm in the magnified area). For the control group, images showed that there was no visual difference along whole flagellum including the tip, suggesting the sheath always tightly wrapping the inner flagellum. For the NanoOrange group, flagella stained with NanoOrange were morphologically identical to that in the control group, indicating that NanoOrange labeling does not affect flagellar growth nor sheath growth. For the fixation group, we saw the sheath detached from the inner flagellum due to fixation, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib13\">Glauert et al., 1963</a>). Only after formalin fixation do flagella lose their sheath, which helps us to recognize the two-layered structure of sheath and the core flagellar filament. Consistent with the previous study (<a href=\"#bib13\">Glauert et al., 1963</a>), the sheathed flagellum has an over-all diameter of about 300 \u00c5 and the inner flagellum is only\u00a0~120 \u00c5 in diameter. By these experiments, we confirmed the flagella of <i>Vibrio alginolyticus</i> are wrapped by sheath and the growth of flagella and sheath are tightly synchronized. Therefore, labeling flagellar sheath by NanoOrange is a robust method to quickly visualize the flagellar growth in <i>V. alginolyticus.</i>."

In 1974, Iino (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iino, 1974</a>) used electron microscopy to observe the lengths of <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> flagella in different growth phases and reported that the flagellar growth rate decays exponentially with its length. Later, <a href=\"#bib1\">Aizawa and Kubori (1998)</a> used dark-field microscopy to measure the bacterial flagellar length distribution at different time points and confirmed the same result. In contrast, more recently, (<a href=\"#bib39\">Turner et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2012</a>) labeled <i>Escherichia coli</i>'s pre-existing and newly grown flagellar segments with fluorescent dyes of two different colors and found that the average flagellar growth rate is a constant value independent of the flagellar length. There currently exist different theoretical predictions on the relationship between growth rate and length (<a href=\"#bib19\">Keener, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Schmitt and Stark, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Tanner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Stern and Berg, 2013</a>). Despite this controversy, nearly all existing experimental investigations have been based on population measurements of flagellar length at two different time points at long intervals. For a better understanding of flagellar growth dynamics, a comprehensive, accurate and in vivo real-time measurement of single flagellar growth is required."

Initially, the flagellum grows at a constant rate when its length is below 1500 nm. While it continues to grow, the growth rate decreases sharply. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo real-time recording of single filament growth, covering the full range of filament lengths.

Observation of flagella on a living cell can be achieved by dark-field microscopy, but its spatial resolution is very poor and only flagella longer than 4\u20135 \u03bcm can be resolved (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aizawa and Kubori, 1998</a>) due to the strong light scattering from the cell body. Electron microscopy (EM) offers high enough resolution, but with that technology live cell imaging is not possible. Thus, we have to rely on fluorescent imaging to measure flagellar growth; (2) labeling must be quick to allow subsequent staining of newly grown flagellar filament. Also, to enable real-time measurement, the staining reagent has to be present in the bacterial growth medium. Therefore, the label must be non- or weakly fluorescent when not binding to its target, otherwise the background will be too high to resolve the growing filament; (3) most bacteria species possess multiple extracellular flagella, all of which are swinging and can be entangled, making accurate measurement of single flagellar growth difficult."

Previous research (<a href=\"#bib26\">McCarter, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allen and Baumann, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Glauert et al., 1963</a>) and our TEM studies revealed the synchronized growth of sheath and flagellum, with the sheath always tightly wrapping the inner flagellum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>) and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1</a>;\u00a0(3). The rich lipids constituent in the\u00a0sheath can\u00a0be easily\u00a0labeled by a hydrophobic domain targeting fluorescent dye, NanoOrange (<a href=\"#bib14\">Grossart et al., 2000</a>). NanoOrange is virtually non-fluorescent before binding and increases its fluorescence dramatically after binding to the sheath (<a href=\"#bib14\">Grossart et al., 2000</a>). Therefore, high-resolution fluorescence images of flagella with good contrast can be obtained without washing away the labeling reagent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>), which allows subsequent staining of newly grown segments; (4) The labeling speed of NanoOrange is very fast (&lt;1 min) and does not influence flagellar growth (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), ensuring immediate visualization of newly grown flagellum, which is necessary to measure flagellar growth in real time; 5) Along with the cell body, the sheathed flagellum is prone to attach to the poly-L-lysine coated coverslip surface.

For the real-time observation of flagellar growth, cells attached to the coverslip were imaged under an automatic fluorescence microscope equipped with perfect focus system (Materials and methods). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a> shows representative time-lapse images of the fluorescent flagellum of the same cell at time T and T+\u0394T, with the lengths L and L+\u0394L, respectively.

To record the flagellar growth with high-temporal resolution, \u0394T needs to be short. However, it cannot be too short because flagellar growth \u0394L within \u0394T has to be resolvable by the optical resolution of our imaging system, which is one pixel corresponding to 65 nm physical distance."

After preliminary experimental tests, <i>V. alginolyticus</i> after 1.5 hr culturing in VPG broth (Materials and methods), representing cells with short flagella, were imaged to investigate the flagellar growth rate. A time interval of 5 min was adopted in the time-lapse imaging since flagellar growth rate in this regime is relatively fast.

The instantaneous flagellar growth rates vs. flagellar length were then plotted in red dots in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>. The growth rate decreases rapidly as the flagellar length increases from\u00a0~1500 nm to\u00a0~7500 nm. Overall, the growth rate starts in the range of\u00a0~50 nm/min and drops sharply afterwards and decreases to\u00a0~9 nm/min at 7500 nm. Our flagellar growth rate measurement is not sensitive to the chosen time interval since there is a region (between 1000 and 3000 nm) where both our 5 min and 20 min data overlap and agree. This provides assurance that the observed decay in flagellar growth rate is not an artifact caused by different measuring intervals and culturing time."

We can only analyze very limited cells in which accurate flagellar length measurement is possible. <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a</a> displays some representative examples. Using the same definition we introduced earlier, the instantaneous flagellar growth rate can be calculated (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>, black dots).

In this experiment, <i>V. alginolyticus</i> cells were imaged every 5 min. Owing to the high temporal and spatial resolution offered by our experiment, we were able to follow the\u00a0in\u00a0vivo flagellar growth dynamically. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a> shows representative continuous time-lapse recording of a single bacterial cell and its growing flagellum. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, the corresponding flagellar length vs. time curve is presented as the red line. The instantaneous flagellar growth rate is then calculated as the length difference between two\u00a0adjacent images divided by 5 min, as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>, on top of the population measurement data from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>. In contrast to previous reports of a constant growth rate in <i>E. coli</i> or a monotonically decreasing rate in <i>S. typhimurium</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iino, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aizawa and Kubori, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Turner et al., 2012</a>), we found that in <i>V. alginolyticus</i> the flagellar length increases linearly with time when its length is short (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>), which indicates a constant growth rate. When the flagellum grows longer than 1500 nm, the relationship between flagellar length and time deviates from linearity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, the red line), showing a decrease in growth rate. Therefore, we reproduced in single cells the length-dependent flagellar growth seen in population studies, although we were not able to follow continuous growth of flagella longer beyond 4000 nm due to the photobleaching of NanoOrange. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report of in vivo real-time recording of <i>V. alginolyticus</i> single flagellar growth."

By extrapolation, this maximum growth rate is estimated as 50 nm/min that corresponds to transporting 1.7 flagellins per second. The maximum growth rate also reveals the number of working cycles of the T3FSS. Therefore, S<sub>load</sub> was experimentally determined as 1.7 Hz.

Although we have experimental evidence to prove the synchronized growth between sheath and flagella, the exact mechanism driving sheath growth remains a mystery. From the TEM images, we see that sheath forms very compact and organized structure, always wrapping the inner flagellum. This raises another interesting question: how does the sheath self-assemble? It may be that sheath components are secreted through the central channel of the filament following a similar mechanism as the flagellar assembly. The sheath may also have been formed along the exterior of the flagellum, driven by the high motility of lipids. The exact mechanism of sheath assembly, and the relative kinetic comparisons to flagellar growth have not yet been elucidated, and we hope to pursue this in a subsequent study."

Recently, to explain the constant flagellar growth rate of <i>E. coli</i>, two models have been proposed, the single-file diffusion model (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stern and Berg, 2013</a>) and the chain model (<a href=\"#bib9\">Evans et al., 2013</a>). First, the single-file diffusion model without invoking an injection pushing mechanism is a special case of our model when <i>LS</i>\u00a0=\u00a00. As demonstrated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>, to produce a constant flagellar growth rate, the diffusion constant <i>D</i> must be very large to make the loading speed the rate-limiting step. In comparison to our length-dependent flagellar growth data with both a plateau regime and a fast-decay regime, varying <i>D</i> alone is not sufficient to fit the whole curve, as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>. Therefore, a single-file diffusion model without invoking a push mechanism cannot explain our data. Secondly, the chain mechanism was proposed to explain the constant rate of flagellum growth. In this model, flagellin monomers are connected to each other through a head-to-tail linkage, forming a continuous chain in the channel and the entropic force generated from crystallization of flagellin monomer at the growing tip pulls the flagellin chain through the channel. Although this model offers a simple physical mechanism for the constant growth rate, it seems difficult to explain the sharp decay in growth rate of <i>V. alginolyticus</i> when its flagellum grows longer. Moreover, in the case where the multi-subunit chain breaks, the chain of distal subunits is pulled to the growing tip, leaving the chain of basal subunits to diffuse in the channel. Flagellum growth resumes only when the chain of basal subunits reaches the growing tip and crystallizes. During this period, the growth rate decays to zero. One direct prediction from this mechanism is that flagellar growth is not continuous and that pauses in flagellar growth will be observed at different flagellar lengths. In our experiments, we observed neither a constant growth rate nor pauses in flagellar growth. Therefore, our data is not explained by the chain model. Alternately, we have proposed here an injection-diffusion model with injection force that explains our experimental results."

                        "text": "One critical component of the injection-diffusion model is that we have to allow the export apparatus to be able to force the flagellin movement within <i>LS</i> distance. Due to this effect, when flagella are short, they can move fast toward the growing tip even when <i>D</i> is not extra large, leading to a constant growth rate up to 1500 nm. At this stage, the flagellar growth rate is limited by the flagellin loading rate from the secretion system. As this effect vanishes when flagella grow longer, the growth rate drops sharply, as a result of futile diffusion steps of flagellin monomers in the channel. Meanwhile, some flagellins begin to jam in the channel. Such blockage impedes the loading of new flagellins at the base, further reducing the growth rate. Finally, when the flagella are long enough, slow diffusion leads to a high occupancy of flagellins in the channel, whereupon the flagellar growth rate relies again on the secretion force of the export apparatus, but at a much decreased export frequency, therefore converging to a discounted loading speed."

From the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation, the viscous drag coefficient of a single flagellin in the channel is <i>\u03b6=kT/D</i>. The work required to push <i>n</i> flagella <i>s</i> distance at velocity <i>v</i> is <i>W=n\u03b6vs=nkTvs/D</i>. To estimate to maximum energy required for pushing, we consider the condition as follows. In the condition where <i>n\u00a0=\u00a012</i> flagellins are close-packed occupied in the beginning of channel, the secretion machine must push the new-coming flagellin 56 nm forward into the channel, as well as the 12 flagellins ahead of it. Using the best-fit parameter set (<i>LS</i>\u00a0=\u00a012, <i>D</i>\u00a0=\u00a05000 nm<sup>2</sup>/s), we can calculate the free energy required for this insertion. If we assume this insertion can be finished within 0.1 s, that gives v\u00a0=\u00a056 nm/0.1\u00a0s\u00a0=\u00a0560 nm/s and W\u00a0=\u00a075.3kT\u00a0=\u00a03.77 ATP. If we assume this, insertion takes the entire cycling time of the secretion apparatus, which is 0.6 s, that gives v\u00a0=\u00a056 nm/0.6s\u00a0=\u00a093 nm/s and W\u00a0=\u00a012.5kT\u00a0=\u00a00.62 ATP. Previous research suggests that the FliI ATPase at the core of the T3FSS shares similar molecular structure with the F1 ATPase (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ibuki et al., 2011</a>) that can rotate the central shaft for one revolution by hydrolyzing 3 ATP molecules. Although the details of force generation and energy transduction in the T3FSS remain unresolved, from our estimation we see that the hypothesized secretion force applied by the apparatus is reasonable and consistent with our current knowledge about the system."

We see that a simple one-dimensional diffusion with a pushing base and an absorbing tip can support flagellar growth and explain its length-dependent features. From the plateau in growth rate when the flagellum is short, we deduce the loading speed of 1.7 flagellin per second of the <i>V. alginolyticus</i> T3FSS. Compared to the results from Turner et al.\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib40\">Turner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Stern and Berg, 2013</a>), in which the loading of 0.5 flagellin per second was estimated in <i>E. coli</i>, our result is more than three times faster. This difference is possibly due to the difference between bacterial species. More experimental investigations are needed to characterize the length-dependence in flagellar growth in <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. typhimurium</i>, to look for rate-change features. The previously reported constant growth rate in <i>E. coli</i> and exponential decay rate in <i>S.\u00a0typhimurium</i> may be unique to that bacterial species, or may correspond to different regimes of a universal length-dependent growth curve, similar to the one we reported here. The details of the injection mechanism and diffusion process can be further elucidated through mutagenesis or energetic control of cells in the future."

The tunnel containing stained cells was set in a humidity chamber with a temperature-control system to allow flagellar growth at 30\u00b0C. During our imaging, NanoOrange was kept in the imaging medium (1/100 v/v) to ensure timely labeling of newly grown flagellar segments. Because the sheathed flagella readily attach to the poly-L-lysine coated surface, both the cell body and its flagellum are well immobilized on the microscope tunnel slides, enabling several hours of observation to track the flagellar growth. Time-lapse fluorescent images were captured at 5/20 min intervals depending on the flagellar growth rate."

The predicted structure is similar to FliC in the flagellar channel core region (D0 and D1) but less dense on the outer region (D2 and D3), due to its shorter sequence. Hence, the height and width of folded FlaE is the same as FliC. When a flagellin reaches the tip of the growing flagellum, it crystallizes immediately and this flagellin becomes the new extension of the flagellum.

Thus, they can monitor changes in length without manipulating cells (e.g., washing and staining). This is a notable improvement. They show that the sheath is closely opposed to the filament. Presumably the sheath grows at its base where it is contiguous with the cell's outer membrane, but this is not known."

First, the single-file diffusion model without invoking the injection pushing mechanism is a special case of our model when <i>LS</i>=0. As demonstrated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4(B</a>), for <i>D</i>&lt;3x10<sup>4</sup> nm<sup>2</sup>/s, it is hard to reproduce the plateau phase in the growth rate when flagellum is shorter than 1500 nm. To achieve the plateau shown in our experimental data, it requires <i>D</i>\u22484x10<sup>4</sup> nm<sup>2</sup>/s, a value which seems unrealistic for flagellin diffusion in the channel. Additionally, a large <i>D</i> would result in slow decay in the growth rate when flagellum grows longer, which conflicts with our experimental observation. Therefore, we conclude that the single-file diffusion model without an additional injection pushing mechanism does not explain our data. Secondly, the chain mechanism was proposed to explain the constant rate of flagellum growth, in which the entropic force derived from flagellin crystallization automatically adjusts with the length of the multi-subunit chain to support a constant rate of subunit transit that is independent of channel length. However, in the case where the multi-subunit chain breaks, the chain of distal subunits is pulled to the growing tip, leaving the chain of basal subunits to diffuse in the channel. Flagellum growth resumes only when the chain of basal subunits reaches the growing tip and crystallizes. During this period, the growth rate decays to zero. One direct prediction from this mechanism is that flagellar growth is not continuous and that pauses in flagellar growth will be observed at different flagellar lengths. In our experiments we observed neither a constant growth rate nor pauses in flagellar growth. Therefore, our data is not explained by the chain model. Extra detail has been added to the comparison and discussion of these models in the third paragraph of the Discussion."

However, in the case where the multi-subunit chain breaks, the distal subunits chain is pulled to the growing tip, leaving the basal subunits chain diffusing in the channel. The flagellum growth can resume only when the basal subunits chain reaches the growing tip and crystallizes. During this period, the growth rate decays to zero. A direct prediction from this mechanism is that flagellar growth is not continuous and paused flagellar growth would be observed at different flagellar lengths. We assume that longer the flagellum is, the more easily it breaks, at more locations. This reduces the growth rate of longer flagellum, which is caused by many long pausing events in subunit transit.
