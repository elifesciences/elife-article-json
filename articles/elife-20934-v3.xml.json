We probed the effects on mRNA recruitment of a library of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> eIF3 functional variants spanning its 5 essential subunits using an in vitro-reconstituted system. Mutations throughout eIF3 disrupt its interaction with the PIC and diminish its ability to accelerate recruitment to a native yeast mRNA. Alterations to the eIF3a CTD and eIF3b/i/g significantly slow mRNA recruitment, and mutations within eIF3b/i/g destabilize eIF2\u2022GTP\u2022Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> binding to the PIC. Using model mRNAs lacking contacts with the 40S entry or exit channels, we uncovered a critical role for eIF3 requiring the eIF3a NTD, in stabilizing mRNA interactions at the exit channel, and an ancillary role at the entry channel requiring residues of the eIF3a CTD. These functions are redundant: defects at each channel can be rescued by filling the other channel with mRNA."

We probed the effects on mRNA recruitment of a library of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> eIF3 functional variants spanning its 5 essential subunits using an in vitro-reconstituted system. Mutations throughout eIF3 disrupt its interaction with the PIC and diminish its ability to accelerate recruitment to a native yeast mRNA. Alterations to the eIF3a CTD and eIF3b/i/g significantly slow mRNA recruitment, and mutations within eIF3b/i/g destabilize eIF2\u2022GTP\u2022Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> binding to the PIC. Using model mRNAs lacking contacts with the 40S entry or exit channels, we uncovered a critical role for eIF3 requiring the eIF3a NTD, in stabilizing mRNA interactions at the exit channel, and an ancillary role at the entry channel requiring residues of the eIF3a CTD. These functions are redundant: defects at each channel can be rescued by filling the other channel with mRNA."

                        "text": "The goal of translation initiation is to assemble the ribosome at the start (AUG) codon of an mRNA in a state ready to begin reading the message and synthesizing the corresponding protein. This represents one of the most important readings of the genetic code because initiation at the wrong site results in extended, truncated or out of frame translation products. To ensure faithful identification of the start codon, translation initiation in eukaryotes follows a complex, multi-step pathway which requires the participation of 12 initiation factors (eIFs) (reviewed in: (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aitken and Lorsch, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hinnebusch, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Val\u00e1sek, 2012</a>). The process begins with the formation of a 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC), in which the initiator methionyl tRNA (Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>) is initially positioned as a tRNA<sub>i</sub>\u2022eIF2\u2022GTP ternary complex (TC) on the small (40S) ribosomal subunit. The 43S PIC further contains eIF1 and eIF1A bound, respectively, near the 40S P and A sites, as well as eIF5 and eIF3. GTP hydrolysis by eIF2 can proceed within the PIC, but the release of inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) is blocked by the presence of eIF1. With the collaboration of eIF4B and the eIF4F complex composed of eIF4A, eIF4G, and eIF4E, the PIC is then loaded onto the 5\u2019 end of the mRNA, from which it scans in the 3\u2019 direction to locate the AUG codon, thus generating the 48S PIC. Both loading onto the mRNA and subsequent scanning are facilitated by an open conformation of the PIC enforced by the binding of eIF1. Recognition of the AUG codon triggers eviction of eIF1, gating P<sub>i</sub> release by eIF2 and provoking a transition from the open PIC conformation to a closed conformation that arrests scanning. Joining of a 60S ribosomal subunit completes assembly of the 80S initiation complex, which can then proceed to the elongation cycle."

Subsequent studies in the presence of the helicase DHX29 refined this placement, identifying two main points of contact near the 40S platform, as well as potential peripheral domains of eIF3 near the 40S head above the platform and below DHX29 nearer the mRNA entry channel (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hashem et al., 2013</a>)."

In these structures, eIF3 (shown in blues and reds from py48S-closed structure) is found bound primarily to the 40S (light grey) solvent face, via two main points of contact. First, the eIF3a (dark blue) NTD and eIF3c (light blue) CTD PCI (<b>P</b>roteasome/<b>C</b>op9/e<b>I</b>F3) domains form a heterodimer that binds below the platform, near the mRNA exit channel pore (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). A second contact is formed closer to the mRNA entry-channel side of the PIC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), in the vicinity of helix 16 (h16) and helix 18 (h18) of the 40S rRNA. This contact is made by the eIF3b (light blue) \u03b2-propeller domain, consistent with its described interaction with uS4 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2014</a>), and is likely connected to the first contact via a previously identified interaction between the eIF3b RRM and the eIF3a CTD (<a href=\"#bib63\">Valasek et al., 2001b</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Val\u00e1\u0161ek et al., 2002</a>), which likely spans the solvent face (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In both the mammalian structure and the yeast eIF3\u202240S\u2022eIF1\u2022eIF1A structure, the eIF3i and eIF3g subunits are found above the eIF3b subunit, near the solvent-face opening of the mRNA entry channel; with the exception of the non-essential eIF3j subunit, no density for eIF3 was observed on the intersubunit face of the 40S in these structures. In the partial 48S structure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), the eIF3c (light blue) NTD extends from the eIF3a/eIF3c PCI heterodimer near the exit channel towards the intersubunit face, projecting near the P-site, where it appears to interact with eIF1 (pink). Near the entry channel, the eIF3a CTD extends away from eIF3b (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), wrapping around the 40S, spanning the intersubunit face, and nearly meeting the eIF3c NTD near the P-site, effectively encircling the 43S PIC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In this structure, the eIF3i (maroon) and eIF3g (red) subunits are located together with the eIF3b C-terminal region on the intersubunit face near the A site and below the intersubunit-face opening of the mRNA entry channel, where eIF3i interacts with the eIF2\u03b3 portion of the TC (green and charcoal). In a recent structure of mammalian eIF3 bound to an apparently late-stage initiation complex, eIF3i was found at a distinct location on the intersubunit face of the PIC, leading to the suggestion that the density observed near TC in the yeast py48S-closed structure is in fact the \u03b2-propeller of eIF3b and not eIF3i (<a href=\"#bib55\">Simonetti et al., 2016</a>)."

Based on their apparent locations near either the solvent-face or intersubunit-face openings of the mRNA entry channel, eIF3i, eIF3g, the C-terminal region of eIF3b, and the eIF3a CTD together compose the entry-channel arm. The exit-channel arm comprises the eIF3a NTD and eIF3c CTD PCI heterodimer located below the platform at the solvent-face opening of the mRNA exit channel. The presence of eIF3 subunits at both mRNA channels, near the P site, and encircling the PIC does not, however, clarify the mechanistic nature of their involvement during steps of the initiation pathway. These regions of eIF3 might participate actively in these events, interacting and collaborating with the 40S, mRNA, and initiation factors to stimulate mRNA recruitment, scanning, and start-codon recognition. eIF3 might also alter the conformation of the PIC to indirectly enhance the efficiency of these steps or serve as a scaffold upon which other factors can bind."

Our results demonstrate that regions throughout the eIF3 complex contribute to its interaction with the PIC and its role in mRNA recruitment. In particular, the mRNA entry-channel arm of eIF3 and eIF3b appear to play a role in stabilizing TC binding to the PIC and accelerating mRNA recruitment. In contrast, the mRNA exit channel arm of eIF3 is required to stabilize the binding of mRNA within the PIC, and this function can be attributed to the extreme N-terminal region of the eIF3a subunit."

This interpretation is corroborated by structural studies that identify points of contact between the 43S PIC and eIF3, as described above. To directly interrogate the contributions of the eIF3 subunits to the 43S:eIF3 interaction, we first examined the ability of each eIF3 variant to bind 43S complexes in vitro. To this end, we assembled 43S complexes using purified 40S subunits, saturating levels of eIF1 and eIF1A, and a limiting concentration of TC containing initiator tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> charged with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine, and incubated them with increasing concentrations of each variant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Native gel electrophoresis of the reactions enables separation of free tRNA<sub>i</sub> from TC bound to both 43S and 43S\u2022eIF3 complexes. In the absence of AUG-containing mRNA, and at the low concentrations of 40S subunits required to measure the affinity of eIF3 for the 43S complex, there is a significant population of free 40S subunits that can compete for eIF3 and complicate the measurement of 43S\u2022eIF3 complex formation. However, because all TC-containing species are resolved by this method, the amount of free eIF3 (as opposed to total eIF3) can be calculated from measured dissociation constants, enabling us to determine the affinity of eIF3 for the 43S complex under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

This behavior may reflect the requirement for stable interaction between the five subunits of the complex prior to binding the PIC. We modeled binding data using both a standard Langmuir binding isotherm and the cooperative Hill curve, and obtained similar results with both methods (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

As with our 43S PIC binding experiments, these experiments produced apparently cooperative binding behavior. WT eIF3 binds 48S PICs tightly (K<sub>D</sub>\u00a0\u2264\u00a038 nM), similar to what we observed for 43S PICs lacking mRNA. The absence of the i and g subunits in the a/b/c sub-complex weakens the apparent eIF3:48S interaction by nearly three-fold, as do the <i>prt1-1</i> and <i>rnp1</i> mutations in eIF3b, by nearly three-fold and more than four-fold, respectively. We also observe\u00a0~2 fold reductions in apparent eIF3 affinity for 48S complexes with mutations in the exit channel arm of eIF3 (<i>\u22068</i> and <i>Box37</i>) and the <i>Box12-SPW</i> mutation in the N-terminal region of eIF3c. In fact, the apparent affinity of most of the eIF3 variants for 48S PICs is similar to that observed for 43S PICs lacking mRNA, perhaps because their apparent 43S PIC affinity, even in the absence of mRNA, is tighter than the resolution of our assay. An alternative explanation is that stabilizing contacts with the mRNA are offset by changes in the complex that weaken other interactions with eIF3. In contrast, both the <i>H725P</i> and <i>R731I</i> substitutions within the eIF3a CTD display higher apparent affinities in the presence of mRNA than in its absence, perhaps because mRNA contributes interactions with eIF3 that can supplement those disrupted by these mutations. It is also possible that both variants, which appear to affect the transition between open and closed conformations of the PIC in vivo (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chiu et al., 2010</a>), bind more readily to the closed conformation of the PIC stabilized by AUG-containing mRNA. Presumably, the contribution of these effects to the affinity of WT eIF3 for 48S complexes is masked by its already tight interaction with the 43S PIC lacking mRNA."

These experiments employed the assay described above, only each eIF3 variant was included at saturating levels relative to its measured affinity for the 43S PIC and the concentration of 40S subunits was varied. We have previously reported the thermodynamic coupling between TC binding to the 43S complex and the presence of mRNA with an AUG codon in the 40S P site. In the presence of AUG-containing model mRNA, the affinity of TC for the 43S PIC is\u00a0~10 pM (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kolitz et al., 2009</a>); in the absence of mRNA this affinity is reduced by 4 orders of magnitude to 104\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015 nM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, left panel). WT eIF3 stabilizes TC binding to the 43S PIC by\u00a0~7 fold, resulting in an affinity of 15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 nM in the absence of mRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, left panel). For most eIF3 variants, this affinity is not significantly altered. However, the a/b/c sub-complex lacking the i and g subunits weakens the 43S:TC interaction\u00a0~\u00a03 fold, as does the <i>prt1-1</i> mutation in the eIF3b \u03b2-propeller domain. The eIF3b RRM mutation <i>rnp1</i> has a slightly smaller effect on 43S:TC affinity, weakening it\u00a0~\u00a02 fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, left panel)."

In these experiments, 43S complexes were formed in the presence of saturating concentrations of TC, eIF1, eIF1A, eIF5, eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4E\u2022eIF4G, and eIF3; the concentrations of eIF3 and TC were chosen such that they would saturate binding for all variants.

In the presence of WT eIF3, mRNA recruitment occurs with an apparent rate constant of 0.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.023 min<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, light blue circles; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Mutations throughout eIF3 slow this process. The most dramatic effect occurs in the presence of the a/b/c sub-complex, which slows recruitment more than 10-fold and reduces its endpoint nearly five-fold (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, orange circles; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In contrast, the <i>Q258R</i> mutation in eIF3i and the <i>KLF</i> mutation in eIF3g have little effect on the kinetics of <i>RPL41A</i> mRNA recruitment, indicating that they do not alter regions of these subunits that are critical for rapid loading of mRNA onto the PIC. These mutations confer in vivo phenotypes consistent with defects in either the rate of scanning, as in the case of <i>Q258R</i>, or in the processivity of scanning through stable secondary structures, in the case of <i>KLF</i>. It is possible that these defects are not rate-limiting for recruitment of the <i>RPL41A</i> mRNA, which possesses a relatively short (22 nt) 5\u2019 UTR lacking highly-structured elements. These defects may become rate-limiting in the recruitment of mRNAs with longer, more-structured 5\u2019 UTRs. Nonetheless, the fact that both the extent and rate of recruitment of <i>RPL41A</i> mRNA are severely compromised when eIF3 is replaced with the a/b/c sub-complex, together with the previous observation that the loss of eIF3i and eIF3g from the eIF3 complex in vivo critically compromises scanning arrest (<a href=\"#bib28\">Herrmannov\u00e1 et al., 2012</a>), is consistent with our interpretation that this assay is sensitive to scanning defects."

The eIF3b mutations <i>prt1-1</i> and <i>rnp1</i> also slow recruitment, by approximately 4- to 5-fold. Aside from the loss of the i and g subunits, these are the strongest effects we observe on the kinetics of recruitment, suggesting that eIF3b also contributes significantly to rapid mRNA recruitment, perhaps by anchoring the entry-channel arm of eIF3 to the solvent face. The eIF3c NTD mutations <i>GAP<sup>85</sup></i>and <i>Box12-SPW</i>, thought to be located on the opposite side of the PIC near the P site, also slow mRNA recruitment by\u00a0~2 fold. Mutations within the eIF3 exit channel arm, either in the eIF3a NTD (<i>\u03948</i> and <i>Box37</i>) or the eIF3c CTD (<i>\u039460</i>) PCI domains, only slightly reduce the rate of mRNA recruitment; nonetheless, <i>Box37</i> significantly slows recruitment at 37\u02daC (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), consistent with its temperature-sensitive phenotype in vivo\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib37\">Khoshnevis et al., 2014</a>).

The eIF4 factors \u2013 eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4E, and eIF4G \u2013 have previously been shown to play critical roles during mRNA recruitment both in vivo and in vitro\u00a0(reviewed in: <a href=\"#bib30\">Hinnebusch, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jackson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</a>). Our system recapitulates the requirement for these factors in the recruitment of capped natural mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mitchell et al., 2010</a>) and was previously employed to demonstrate that the absence of eIF4B increases the concentration of eIF4A required for efficient mRNA recruitment (<a href=\"#bib67\">Walker et al., 2013</a>), consistent with the genetic interaction between these two factors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coppolecchia et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">de\u00a0la Cruz et al., 1997</a>). However, varying the concentration of either eIF4A, eIF4B, or eIF4E\u2022eIF4G in mRNA recruitment reactions confirmed that these factors were still saturating for each eIF3 variant under the conditions of our experiments (data not shown). These results suggest that the mRNA recruitment defects we observe do not arise from diminished interaction of the eIF4 factors with the PIC caused by the mutations in eIF3. Moreover, because TC was included at a concentration that saturates its binding in the presence of all variants, we can rule out the possibility that the observed defects are downstream effects of TC binding defects. These in turn imply that eIF3 acts directly to coordinate events during mRNA recruitment, rather than simply helping to recruit TC or the eIF4 factors."

Because complexes formed on 3\u20195-AUG mRNA contain almost no mRNA in the entry channel, they would be expected to be hypersensitive to loss of mRNA interactions in or around the exit channel.

To probe the positions of interactions in the exit channel we measured the extent of recruitment of a model mRNA in which the AUG codon is 11 nucleotides from the 5\u2019-end (5\u201911-AUG), resulting in a complex with the exit channel mostly occupied, and compared it to the recruitment observed on the 5\u20195-AUG mRNA, which leaves the exit channel mostly empty and is sensitive to certain entry-channel arm mutations in eIF3. The addition of the six extra nucleotides in the 5\u201911-AUG mRNA relative to 5\u20195-AUG mRNA fully or partially rescues the recruitment defects for all of the three eIF3 variants affected by mutations in the eIF3a CTD, leading to recruitment extents nearly as high as those observed with the mid-AUG mRNA that fills the exit channel and extends beyond it (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

The 3\u201911-AUG mRNA, which programs a recruited complex with 11 nucleotides in the entry channel, partially rescues recruitment in the presence of the <i>\u22068</i> variant, to an endpoint of 28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% of total mRNA recruited, but is not sufficient to restore recruitment to the levels observed on the mid-AUG mRNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Increasing the length of mRNA in the entry channel to 14 and 17 nucleotides progressively rescues the defect, resulting in endpoints of approximately 85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% and 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3%, respectively\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).\u00a0These extents of recruitment approach those observed in the presence of the <i>\u22068</i> variant for both the 5'5-AUG and mid-AUG mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>), which both result in a fully-occupied entry channel, suggesting that between 14 and 17 nucleotides of mRNA is sufficient to restore interactions there. The rescue of recruitment we observe with <i>\u22068</i> and the 5\u201914-AUG mRNA is not markedly affected by the absence of any eIF4 factor, or eIF5 (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>), suggesting that the interactions restored upon filling the entry channel with 14 nucleotides are with either the PIC itself or eIF3. While mRNA is not visible in the entry channel of recent structures of the 48S PIC containing eIF3, a previous structure of a partial 48S complex lacking eIF3 shows the mRNA up to position\u00a0+12, where it threads past the 40S latch and projects towards a constriction between uS5, uS3, and eS30, and near h16 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hussain et al., 2014</a>).

Because the cell likely contains no mRNAs resembling the 3\u20195-AUG mRNA, in which the AUG codon is followed by only 5 nucleotides, we instead reasoned that the <i>\u22068</i> eIF3 mutant, which is insensitive to the absence of mRNA in the exit channel, might confer a relatively weaker recruitment defect relative to WT cells on mRNAs with extremely short 5'-UTRs, because the majority of mRNA recruitment and scanning on these mRNAs will occur while the exit channel remains empty. In this case, both WT and mutant cells will have the same lack of contacts between mRNA and the PIC in the exit channel. In contrast, the recruitment of mRNAs with longer 5'-UTRs would produce a greater defect for the mutant, as the majority of the scanning process occurs with the exit channel occupied, giving WT PICs an advantage because they are able to make contacts with mRNA in this channel whereas <i>\u22068\u00a0</i>mutant cells are not. To investigate this, we quantified the amount of mRNA associated with native 43S complexes in vivo, stabilized by formaldehyde cross-linking of living yeast cells, for several mRNAs with different 5\u2019 UTR lengths, in strains expressing either WT or the <i>\u22068</i> variant of eIF3a. Consistent with our prediction, the <i>\u22068</i> mutation reduces the amount of mRNA associated with native 43S PICs for all the mRNAs we tested, but has a greater defect relative to WT cells on mRNAs with longer 5\u2019UTRs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>)."

Nonetheless, eIF3 has emerged as a pivotal player in the events that bring the PIC to the mRNA, and ultimately to the start codon. Structural models revealing eIF3 at the 40S solvent face but projecting arms near both the mRNA entry and exit channels, as well as genetic and biochemical evidence consistent with eIF3 operating in these regions, suggest the compelling possibility that eIF3 mediates events such as mRNA recruitment and scanning via these appendages. Our data indicate that while regions throughout eIF3 collaborate to stabilize its binding to the 43S PIC and directly promote mRNA recruitment, the mRNA entry- and exit-channel arms of eIF3 play distinct roles within the PIC. The eIF3 exit-channel arm \u2014 and in particular the eIF3a NTD \u2014 is required to stabilize the binding of mRNA at the exit channel within the 48S PIC (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

The entry-channel arm and its attachment to the solvent face via eIF3b (unresolved regions appear as dashed blue line) is also important for stabilizing TC binding to the PIC and promoting steps that control the kinetics of mRNA recruitment, perhaps as a function of modulating the 40S latch."

In a structure of yeast eIF3 bound to the 40S\u2022eIF1\u2022eIF1A complex (<a href=\"#bib7\">Aylett et al., 2015</a>), eIF3i and eIF3g are found distant from TC on the solvent-face side of the PIC above the eIF3b \u03b2-propeller domain, and appear to interact with eIF3b but not with the 40S subunit.

In the yeast py48S-closed PIC (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ll\u00e1cer et al., 2015</a>), however, these subunits are found at the intersubunit face below the A site, together with the C-terminus of eIF3b; both eIF3i and eIF3g appear to interact with the 40S and eIF3i appears to contact the eIF2\u0263 subunit of TC, consistent with our observation that the absence of eIF3i and eIF3g weakens the binding of both TC and eIF3 to the PIC. Further evidence of a role for eIF3i and eIF3g in contributing to PIC binding by eIF3 is provided by the in vivo effects of the eIF3i <i>DDKK</i> mutation, which results in the dissociation of both of these subunits from the eIF3 complex and reduces the amount of a/b/c sub-complex bound to PICs in vivo\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Herrmannov\u00e1 et al., 2012</a>)."

This stands in contrast to a previous study where the affinity-purified a/b/c sub-complex rescued mRNA recruitment in heat-treated extracts from <i>prt1-1</i> cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">Phan et al., 2001</a>). However, these extracts were not deprived of WT eIF3, perhaps enabling reconstitution of the complex with WT eIF3i and g subunits. In fact, the simultaneous loss of eIF3i and eIF3g from the eIF3 complex in <i>DDKK</i> cells produces phenotypes consistent with significant defects in scanning and start-codon recognition (<a href=\"#bib28\">Herrmannov\u00e1 et al., 2012</a>). Because mRNA recruitment in our assay depends on the presence of an AUG codon, the kinetics we observe may report not only on initial mRNA attachment, but also on the subsequent events of scanning and start-codon recognition, suggesting an inability to efficiently scan and recognize the AUG codon in the absence of eIF3i and g prevents efficient <i>RPL41A</i> recruitment. In light of the severe mRNA recruitment defects we observe in the simultaneous absence of eIF3i and eIF3g, it is notable that neither the <i>Q258R</i> eIF3i mutation nor the <i>KLF</i> eIF3g mutation confer significant defects in mRNA recruitment. One possible explanation for these apparently opposed observations is that these mutations, which appear to affect either the rate or processivity of scanning, confer defects that are not rate limiting on the <i>RPL41A</i> mRNA employed in our assays, whose 5\u2019 UTR is relatively short. It will be interesting to see the effects of these and other mutations that affect the efficiency of scanning by the PIC on the in vitro recruitment of natural mRNAs with longer, more structured 5\u2019 UTRs."

Consistent with these results, both mutations produce in vivo\u00a0phenotypes suggesting significant defects in scanning and start-codon recognition (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nielsen et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2006</a>) and both have also been shown to reduce the amount of eIF3 associated with PICs either in cells or, in the case of <i>prt1-1</i>, in extracts. In several structures of eIF3 bound to the PIC, the eIF3b \u03b2-propeller domain is seen interacting with the 40S solvent face, below h16 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Aylett et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Georges, des et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ll\u00e1cer et al., 2015</a>), consistent with its known interaction with uS4 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). The eIF3b C-terminus, which appears together with eIF3i and eIF3g at the intersubunit face in the yeast py48S-closed structure, has been shown to mediate interactions with eIF3i (<a href=\"#bib5\">Asano et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Herrmannov\u00e1 et al., 2012</a>). Together with the our results and the previous observation that the eIF3b RRM interacts with the eIF3a CTD (<a href=\"#bib63\">Valasek et al., 2001b</a>), these raise the possibility that eIF3b contributes to the working of the eIF3 entry-channel arm by anchoring it to the 40S solvent face and, via its RRM and C-terminal regions, organizing its constituent components. The <i>prt1-1</i> and <i>rnp1</i> mutations might disrupt this mechanistic nexus, explaining the diverse set of defects they confer."

While this model would not explain the TC binding defects we observe in the absence of eIF3i and eIF3g, it would nonetheless still be consistent with the defects in TC affinity that we observe in the presence of eIF3b mutants and with a role for the eIF3 entry channel arm in stabilizing TC binding to the PIC."

These experiments reveal that, while eIF3 is dispensable for stabilizing the binding of mRNA when both the entry and exit channels are occupied, it is essential for doing so when the entry channel is empty and the complex thus depends on interactions with mRNA in the exit channel. Previous work demonstrated that mammalian eIF3 can be cross-linked to mRNA at positions \u22128 thru \u221217 (relative to the AUG at\u00a0+1 to +3), indicating its proximity to mRNA nucleotides just inside the entry channel (\u22128 to \u221210) and protruding from the entry channel pore (\u221211 to \u221217) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Pisarev et al., 2008</a>).

This is consistent with the observation that the <i>\u22068\u00a0</i>truncation impairs reinitiation on <i>GCN4</i> mRNA following translation of uORF1 and uORF2, an effect attributable to the loss of interaction between the eIF3a NTD and nucleotides 5\u2019 of each uORF\u00a0stop codon that otherwise stabilize post-termination 40S subunits and allow them to resume scanning in the presence of WT eIF3 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Guni\u0161ov\u00e1 et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Munzarov\u00e1 et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Szamecz et al., 2008</a>). This role of the eIF3a NTD is also consistent with its placement immediately adjacent to the exit-channel pore in several structures of eIF3 bound to the 40S, in both yeast and mammals (<a href=\"#bib7\">Aylett et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Georges, des et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ll\u00e1cer et al., 2015</a>). In the cryo-EM structure of a yeast 48S PIC containing eIF3, the \u221210 nucleotide of the mRNA is visible as it begins to emerge from the exit channel at the solvent face (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>); we showed that the presence of 11 nucleotides within the exit channel is sufficient to rescue the destabilization caused by mutations affecting the entry channel arm of eIF3 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This effect suggests that the eIF3a NTD might serve to extend the mRNA exit channel behind the 40S platform, interacting directly with mRNA as it emanates from the exit-channel pore. Another possibility is that the eIF3a NTD influences the conformation of the exit channel, promoting stable interaction between the mRNA and components of the 40S within the channel. Thus, the established stimulatory effects on translation initiation conferred by a minimum 5\u2019UTR length and favorable sequence context just upstream of the start codon might also depend on proper interactions of 5\u2019UTR nucleotides with the 40S exit channel, and hence, could be influenced by the eIF3a-NTD."

And yet, the absence of eIF3, or the presence of eIF3 variants with eIF3a-CTD mutations <i>H725P, R731I,</i> or <i>Box6</i>, all reduce binding of a model mRNA in which the exit channel is empty but the entry channel is filled (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>); these binding defects are largely rescued by increasing the amount of mRNA upstream of the AUG codon to fill the exit channel completely (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). These results implicate the eIF3a CTD in stabilizing mRNA interactions at the entry channel of the PIC in a manner that is redundant with mRNA interactions at the entry channel involving the eIF3a NTD. Consistent with this, the presence of increasing amounts of mRNA in the entry channel progressively rescues the destabilization of mRNA binding to the PIC conferred by the <i>\u22068</i> variant, which is defective for interactions at the exit channel (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). These observations might reflect the importance of a constriction of the mRNA entry channel formed by a movement of the 40S head that appears to be triggered by start codon recognition (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ll\u00e1cer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). This head movement also closes the latch on the entry channel, a feature composed of interactions between 18S rRNA helices 18 and 34 and ribosomal proteins uS3/uS5, which might contribute to scanning arrest upon start-codon recognition (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ll\u00e1cer et al., 2015</a>). One explanation for our finding that full rescue of the <i>\u22068\u00a0</i>exit channel defect requires filling the entry channel with\u00a0~14\u201317 nucleotides is that this represents the minimum length of mRNA required to fully engage the 40S components of the entry channel in its restricted conformation within the closed PIC and to also pass through the constriction created by the closed latch and interact with elements beyond it, which could include the eIF3a CTD. In fact, the structure of a partial yeast 48S complex lacking eIF3 (py48S) shows that 9 nt 3\u2019 of the AUG codon (nucleotide\u00a0+\u00a012) is long enough to pass beyond h18/h34, but not past uS3/uS5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hussain et al., 2014</a>). It is notable that, with the exception of h34, every 40S component of the latch has been implicated in interactions with eIF3 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chiu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Val\u00e1\u0161ek et al., 2003</a>)."

This might occur as a result of disruptions to the proposed rearrangement of the entry-channel arm upon mRNA binding to the PIC. In the end, the role of the eIF3 entry channel arm appears distinct from its counterpart at the exit channel (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Whereas it contributes more subtly to stabilizing mRNA binding to the PIC, it contributes indirectly to mRNA recruitment by stabilizing TC binding and, as evidenced by its importance in the recruitment of natural mRNA, participates in events that control the rate of mRNA recruitment or scanning, perhaps by responding to the presence of mRNA within the PIC and by modulating the conformation of the 40S latch."

Future work is required to better understand the molecular details of these contributions, particularly in the entry channel, where eIF3 appears to play a more subtle mechanistic role, perhaps collaborating with the 40S itself to mediate interaction with the mRNA. It will also be interesting to determine how, if at all, yeast eIF3 collaborates with the other mRNA recruitment factors to drive this event."

Reactions were initiated by the simultaneous addition of ATP\u2022Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the appropriate [<sup>32</sup>P]-capped mRNA to final concentrations of 2 mM and 15 nM, respectively. For kinetic measurements, 4 \u00b5L aliquots were removed at appropriate time points, added to 1 \u00b5l of loading buffer and quenched by loading on a 4% native THEM gel running at 200 V. Gels were exposed and quantified as above, with the fraction of mRNA recruitment quantified as the fraction of signal in the band representing 48S PICs per lane. Data were fit with single-exponential rate equations to obtain the observed rate constant of mRNA recruitment. To measure the maximal extent of recruitment at completion, reactions were similarly resolved on a 4% native THEM gel upon incubation for 2 hr at 26\u02daC, at which point all reactions had proceeded to completion as judged by prior kinetic experiments. For experiments containing <i>RPL41A</i> mRNA, gels were run for 1 hr at 200 V. For experiments containing 50 nt model mRNAs, gels were run 45 min at 200 V."

Total RNA was isolated from 500 \u00b5L of each of 13 gradient fractions by hot-phenol extraction, and resuspended in 26 \u00b5L of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H<sub>2</sub>O. Prior to RNA isolation, 3 \u00b5L of TATAA Universal RNA Spike I (Tataa Biocenter) was added to each fraction as a normalization control. 3 \u00b5L of total RNA were subjected to reverse transcription using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Aliquots of cDNA were diluted six-fold, and qPCR amplifications were performed on 2 \u00b5L of diluted cDNA in 10 \u00b5L reaction mixtures prepared with the 5x HOT FIREPol EvaGreen qPCR Supermix (Solis Biodyne) and primers for RPL41A (0.3 \u00b5M), 18S rRNA, PMP3, SME1, COX14, RPS28A and spike (0.4 \u00b5M) using the CFX384 Real-Time System (Biorad)."

In yeast, eIF3 is composed of 5 core subunits that have been studied genetically and biochemically, primarily by the authors and their collaborators, yielding a number of important insights into translation initiation. The reconstituted system used here allows the authors to more rigorously explore eIF3 function as compared to earlier efforts. The authors purify a series of mutant forms of eIF3 that had been studied before (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2) to identify biochemically the specific defects in 43S preinitiation complex (43S PIC) and 48S PIC assembly. They uncover a requirement for eIF3a NTD in stabilizing mRNA interactions at the exit channel. Their results also indicate that the eIF3 entry channel arm and eIF3b stabilize TC binding to the pre-initiation complex and is important for mRNA recruitment."

The authors do see evidence for some cooperativity in eIF3 binding (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). From their results, the authors also suggest that some of the modulation could be due to shifts in the equilibrium between an \"open\" and \"closed\" form of the PIC seen in prior biochemical and structural work."

Together with the previous observation that the <i>DDKK</i> eIF3i mutation (which evicts eIF3i and eIF3g from the eIF3 complex) confers a phenotype consistent with a severe scanning arrest defect in vivo, we believe this is consistent with the interpretation that our assay (which depends on the presence of an AUG codon in the mRNA) reports on events up to and including start codon recognition, and is thus potentially sensitive to scanning defects as well. It is possible that the recruitment of <i>RPL41A</i> mRNA (whose 5\u2019 UTR is relatively short, at 22 nt, and lacks highly-structured elements) is not rate-limited by the scanning defects of the <i>Q258R</i> eIF3i and <i>KLF</i> eIF3g mutations, whose in vivo phenotypes suggest defects in rate or processivity of scanning through secondary structures, respectively. These defects might become rate-limiting for the recruitment of natural mRNAs whose 5\u2019-UTRs are longer or more highly structured."

Because we did not make any claims in the Abstract regarding the effects of eIF3 mutations on scanning, and because it remains entirely possible that our in vitro assay does in fact report on scanning defects (for the reasons given above), we chose not to exclude this possibility in the Abstract. Even if it were true, it would not change any of the essential conclusions described in the Abstract."
