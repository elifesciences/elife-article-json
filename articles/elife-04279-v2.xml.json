If newly-acquired genes burden the host, their utility will depend on further evolutionary refinement of the recombinant strain. We used laboratory evolution to recapitulate this process of transfer and refinement, demonstrating that effective use of an introduced dichloromethane degradation pathway required one of several mutations to the bacterial host that are predicted to increase chloride efflux. We then used this knowledge to identify parallel, beneficial mutations that independently evolved in two natural dichloromethane-degrading strains. Finally, we constructed a synthetic mobile genetic element carrying both the degradation pathway and a chloride exporter, which preempted the adaptive process and directly enabled effective dichloromethane degradation across diverse <i>Methylobacterium</i> environmental isolates. Our results demonstrate the importance of post\u2013transfer refinement in horizontal gene transfer, with potential applications in bioremediation and synthetic biology."

If newly-acquired genes burden the host, their utility will depend on further evolutionary refinement of the recombinant strain. We used laboratory evolution to recapitulate this process of transfer and refinement, demonstrating that effective use of an introduced dichloromethane degradation pathway required one of several mutations to the bacterial host that are predicted to increase chloride efflux. We then used this knowledge to identify parallel, beneficial mutations that independently evolved in two natural dichloromethane-degrading strains. Finally, we constructed a synthetic mobile genetic element carrying both the degradation pathway and a chloride exporter, which preempted the adaptive process and directly enabled effective dichloromethane degradation across diverse <i>Methylobacterium</i> environmental isolates. Our results demonstrate the importance of post\u2013transfer refinement in horizontal gene transfer, with potential applications in bioremediation and synthetic biology."

The ability of bacteria to acquire genes by horizontal gene transfer is thought to be the main reason for the rapid evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as MRSA."

Examining the DNA sequences of these bacteria showed several mutations that both improved the ability of the bacteria to survive on DCM and helped the bacteria to more efficiently remove chloride ions from their systems. Chloride ions accumulate as DCM is broken down; therefore, Michener et al. suggest that being exposed to too much chloride prevented the bacteria in previous experiments from growing well. This idea is further supported by mutations found in previously isolated bacteria that live on DCM. These mutations increase the bacteria's ability to excrete chloride ions from their cells, and when Michener et al. removed these mutations, the bacteria no longer grew well on DCM."

These horizontally-transferred genes and pathways play important roles in processes ranging from the spread of antibiotic resistance to ecological differentiation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Forsberg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Shapiro et al., 2012</a>). When, for example, a new environmental niche opens up through the introduction of a xenobiotic compound, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can speed the assembly and dissemination of a corresponding catabolic pathway (<a href=\"#bib51\">Springael and Top, 2004</a>). However, newly-acquired abilities may be costly for the host until they are carefully integrated into existing metabolic and regulatory networks (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kim and Copley, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yadid et al., 2013</a>). The challenges associated with such adaptations are highlighted by many examples from metabolic engineering, where productively transferring genes and pathways into new hosts often requires significant post\u2013transfer refinement (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Michener et al., 2012</a>)."

Laboratory evolution has been used extensively to study natural evolutionary processes. Recent experiments have highlighted the mechanisms by which evolution can optimize existing traits (<a href=\"#bib13\">Elena and Lenski, 2003</a>), select for the emergence of a novel ability (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blount et al., 2012</a>), and refine a rudimentary pathway (<a href=\"#bib43\">Quandt et al., 2014</a>). Laboratory studies focusing on genetic exchanges between microbes have described the recombination of mutations within an evolving population (<a href=\"#bib60\">Winkler and Kao, 2012</a>) or the replacement of an endogenous metabolic pathway with an alternative route (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chou et al., 2011</a>). Meanwhile, metabolic engineers have used adaptive evolution as an engineering tool, including the evolution of highly modified strains, but under conditions that do not reproduce HGT (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Trinh and Srienc, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lee and Palsson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). In this work, we combined these approaches to study how microbes evolve following the acquisition through horizontal gene transfer of a novel metabolic ability by deliberately transferring a mobile metabolic pathway into a new host and then using experimental evolution to select for its efficient use."

Most notably, <i>Methylobacterium extorquens</i> DM4, a methylotrophic Alphaproteobacterium, has served as a reference model to elucidate the details of bacterial growth with DCM (<a href=\"#bib19\">G\u00e4lli and Leisinger, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Muller et al., 2011a</a>). <i>M. extorquens</i> DM4 expresses a dehalogenase, DcmA, whose gene shows clear signs of horizontal transfer (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schmid-Appert et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Vuilleumier et al., 2009</a>) and whose product, formaldehyde, feeds directly into central methylotrophic metabolism (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chistoserdova, 2011</a>)."

We complemented these efforts using a synthetic approach involving conjugal transfer of the <i>dcmA</i> gene into several na\u00efve <i>Methylobacterium</i> strains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kayser et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Michener et al., 2014</a>). These <i>dcmA</i> transconjugants showed DCM dehalogenase activity but grew poorly on DCM, and we previously investigated factors that might explain their limited growth (<a href=\"#bib38\">Michener et al., 2014</a>). Growing on DCM using the <i>dcmA</i> catabolic pathway is very challenging for the host, as its products and intermediates include formaldehyde, hydrochloric acid, and the alkylating agent <i>S</i>-chloromethylglutathione (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kayser et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kayser and Vuilleumier, 2001</a>). As DCM dehalogenase activity was generally high in transconjugant strains (<a href=\"#bib38\">Michener et al., 2014</a>), we hypothesized that one or more of these stresses was limiting growth in the transconjugants and thus required post\u2013transfer evolutionary refinement of the host to produce highly active DCM-degrading strains."

We sequenced the genomes of these evolved strains to identify the mutations that increased fitness on DCM and then reconstructed these mutations in isogenic backgrounds to measure their effect on fitness (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Based on these mutations, we could infer both the primary limiting stress that the pathway placed on its host as well as the biochemical mechanisms that the cells used to overcome this stress. Finally, we used this knowledge to uncover naturally-occurring refining mutations in two DCM-degrading environmental isolates and to design an improved gene cassette that enhances DCM bioremediation by preempting the need for post\u2013transfer refinement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

Working backward from these mutations allowed us to determine that chloride accumulation appears to be the most critical factor limiting growth, and to identify multiple mechanisms that alleviate this stress. We found parallel responses at both the genetic and physiological level, indicating that the different strains faced similar challenges when forced to use their new metabolic capability and overcame these challenges in similar ways. Horizontal transfer of <i>dcmA</i> is not sufficient for efficient growth on DCM and, in both the laboratory and the environment, microbes must also acquire refining mutations to optimize the newly-acquired pathway."

First, the observed mutations in <i>secY</i> are predicted to turn the protein translocase into a leaky chloride channel, as demonstrated previously in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dalal and Duong, 2009</a>). Our growth rate measurements confirm that <i>secY</i> mutants are more sensitive to extracellular chloride, as we would expect if the mutant SecY facilitates chloride diffusion across the cell membrane. Second, mutations to the promoter of <i>clcA</i> increase <i>clcA</i> expression. The in vivo pH measurements upon DCM addition establish that ClcA imports protons, with a necessary concomitant export of chloride, and that increased ClcA expression leads to increased proton import and chloride export. Similarly, the <i>E. coli</i> response to extreme acid stress uses ClcA to export chloride, with other mechanisms used for proton export (<a href=\"#bib1\">Accardi and Miller, 2004</a>). Third, BesA is predicted to be a chloride channel (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sun et al., 2002</a>) and while we cannot yet explain the mechanism by which the identified mutation would affect its function, we hypothesize that the mutation may also allow increased chloride export. Finally, we observed that double mutants are no more fit than the best single mutant, suggesting that all the mutations we detected are addressing the same physiological limitation. Previous experiments found that mutations affecting the same pathway were less beneficial when combined (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chou et al., 2011</a>), in some cases to the point of being collectively deleterious (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kvitek and Sherlock, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rokyta et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chou et al., 2014</a>).

Indeed, our previous efforts to find a single physiological difference that explained the varied fitness of the ancestral <i>dcmA</i> transconjugants on DCM did not identify chloride sensitivity as a predictive phenotype for fitness during growth on DCM (<a href=\"#bib38\">Michener et al., 2014</a>). There was no reason to expect that chloride was more toxic than protons, but using ClcA to export the chloride, even at the cost of importing yet more protons, was highly beneficial. It appears that excess intracellular chloride is either more toxic or less effectively managed than excess intracellular protons."

Our approach of deliberate horizontal transfer in the laboratory followed by experimental evolution offers an opportunity to identify both the limiting stresses and the mutations that can overcome these stresses. As screens and selections for complex microbial phenotypes are further developed, we expect that this approach will find many applications, both in the analysis of natural microbial isolates and in the optimization of genetically engineered microbes and mobile genetic elements."
