Every day for two weeks, one quarter of the mice were fed water through a tube, a quarter were tube-fed a cocktail of antibiotics, a quarter were injected with saline and a quarter were injected with the cocktail of antibiotics (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

Genes involved in producing the myelin sheath \u2013 which coats nerve fibers and is vital for their activity \u2013 were less active in these mice.

However, it is known that toxic metabolites from the gut can affect the activity of the central nervous system (<a href=\"#bib7\">Shaw, 2010</a>)."

The exact mechanism behind this effect still needs to be pinned down. Given the shortage of effective treatments for mental health disorders, exploring how mood-related behavior might be improved via non-traditional means is certainly worthy of further investigation."
