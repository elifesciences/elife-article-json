In <i>Drosophila</i>, neurons producing the homologous neuropeptide hugin regulate feeding and locomotion in a similar manner. Here, we use EM-based reconstruction to generate the entire connectome of hugin-producing neurons in the <i>Drosophila</i> larval CNS. We demonstrate that hugin neurons use synaptic transmission in addition to peptidergic neuromodulation and identify acetylcholine as a key transmitter. Hugin neuropeptide and acetylcholine are both necessary for the regulatory effect on feeding. We further show that subtypes of hugin neurons connect chemosensory to endocrine system by combinations of synaptic and peptide-receptor connections. Targets include endocrine neurons producing DH44, a CRH-like peptide, and insulin-like peptides. Homologs of these peptides are likewise downstream of neuromedinU, revealing striking parallels in flies and mammals. We propose that hugin neurons are part of an ancient physiological control system that has been conserved at functional and molecular level."

In <i>Drosophila</i>, neurons producing the homologous neuropeptide hugin regulate feeding and locomotion in a similar manner. Here, we use EM-based reconstruction to generate the entire connectome of hugin-producing neurons in the <i>Drosophila</i> larval CNS. We demonstrate that hugin neurons use synaptic transmission in addition to peptidergic neuromodulation and identify acetylcholine as a key transmitter. Hugin neuropeptide and acetylcholine are both necessary for the regulatory effect on feeding. We further show that subtypes of hugin neurons connect chemosensory to endocrine system by combinations of synaptic and peptide-receptor connections. Targets include endocrine neurons producing DH44, a CRH-like peptide, and insulin-like peptides. Homologs of these peptides are likewise downstream of neuromedinU, revealing striking parallels in flies and mammals. We propose that hugin neurons are part of an ancient physiological control system that has been conserved at functional and molecular level."

In addition to these predominantly peripherally released peptides, there is a range of neuropeptides that are employed within the central nervous systems (CNS) of vertebrates and have homologs in invertebrates, e.g. neuropeptide Y (NPY), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) or oxytocin/vasopressin (<a href=\"#bib69\">N\u00e4ssel and Winther, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">N\u00e4ssel and Wegener, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Grimmelikhuijzen and Hauser, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">J\u00e9kely, 2013</a>)."

Hugin is a member of the pyrokinin/PBAN (pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide) peptide family and a <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of NMU that has recently gained traction due to similar effects on behavior in the fly: increased hugin signaling inhibits food intake and promotes locomotion (<a href=\"#bib56\">Melcher\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Schoofs et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bader et al., 2007b</a>). In mammals, distribution of the NMU peptide, NMU-expressing cells and NMU-positive fibers is wide and complex. High levels of NMU have been reported in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, the pituitary, the medulla oblongata of the brain stem, and the spinal cord (<a href=\"#bib21\">Domin et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Ballesta et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Howard et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ivanov et al., 2004</a>). The number of neurons involved and their morphology is unknown. In <i>Drosophila</i>, the distribution of hugin is less complex, yet similar: the peptide is produced by neurons in the subesophageal zone that have hugin-positive projections into the ring gland, the pars intercerebralis and ventral nerve cord (<a href=\"#bib57\">Melcher and Pankratz 2005</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). While comparisons across large evolutionary distances are generally difficult, these regions of the fly brain were suggested to correspond to aforementioned regions of NMU occurrence based on morphological, genetic and functional similarities (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ghysen, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hartenstein, 2006</a>). Consequently, NMU/hugin has previously been referred to as a clear example of evolutionary constancy of peptide function (<a href=\"#bib94\">Taghert and Nitabach, 2012</a>)."

While large-scale connectomic analyses in vertebrates remain challenging, generation of high-resolution connectomes has recently become feasible in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib70\">Ohyama et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Berck et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fushiki et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</a>). We took advantage of this and performed an integrated analysis of synaptic and G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated connectivity of hugin neurons in the CNS of <i>Drosophila</i>. Our data demonstrates that hugin neurons employ small molecule transmitters in addition to the neuropeptide. We identify acetylcholine as a transmitter that is employed by hugin neurons and find that it is required for their effect on feeding behavior. Next, we show that hugin neurons form distinct units, and demonstrate that clusters of neurons employing the same neuropeptide are remarkably different in their synaptic connectivity. One unit of hugin neurons is presynaptic to subsets of median neurosecretory cells (mNSCs) in the protocerebrum. In parallel to the synaptic connectivity, mNSCs also express the G-protein-coupled receptor PK2-R1, a hugin receptor, rendering them likely targets of both fast synaptic transmission and neuromodulatory effects from hugin neurons. These mNSCs produce diuretic hormone 44 (DH44, a CRH-like peptide) and <i>Drosophila</i> insulin-like peptides, both of which have mammalian homologs that are likewise downstream of NMU (<a href=\"#bib114\">Wren et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Malendowicz et al., 2012</a>). Endocrine function is essential to ensure homeostasis of the organism and coordinate fundamental behaviors, such as feeding, mating and reproduction, and acts as integrator of external and internal sensory cues (<a href=\"#bib92\">Swanson, 2000</a>). Consequently, connections between sensory and endocrine systems are found across species (<a href=\"#bib119\">Yoon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Tessmar-Raible et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Strausfeld 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abitua et al., 2015</a>). We show that hugin neurons receive chemosensory input in the subesophageal zone (SEZ), thereby linking chemosensory and neuroendocrine systems."

This population comprises interneurons, which are confined within the CNS, as well as efferent neurons, which leave the CNS. The interneuron type can be subdivided into those projecting to the protocerebrum (hugin-PC, eight neurons) or the ventral nerve cord (hugin-VNC, four neurons). The efferent type can be subdivided into those projecting to the ring gland (hugin-RG, four neurons) or the pharynx (hugin-PH, four neurons) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bader et al., 2007a)</a>. Based on these morphological features, we first reconstructed all hugin neurons in an ssTEM volume covering an entire larval CNS and the major neuroendocrine organ, the ring gland (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; see Materials and methods for details). We then localized synaptic sites, which could be readily identified as optically dense structures (<a href=\"#bib77\">Prokop and Meinertzhagen, 2006</a>). Comparing neurons of the same class, we found the number as well as the distribution of pre- and postsynaptic sites to be very similar among hugin neurons of the same class (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Presynaptic sites are generally defined as having small clear core vesicles (SCVs) containing classic small molecule transmitter for fast synaptic transmission close to the active zone (<a href=\"#bib77\">Prokop and Meinertzhagen, 2006</a>). Efferent hugin neurons (hugin-RG and hugin-PH) showed essentially no presynaptic sites (&lt;1 average/neuron) within the CNS and we did not observe any SCVs. For hugin-RG neurons, membrane specializations resembling presynaptic sites were evident at their projection target, the ring gland. These sites did contain close-by DCVs but no SCVs and had in many cases no corresponding postsynaptic sites in adjacent neurons. Instead they bordered haemal space indicating neuroendocrine release (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The configuration of hugin-PH terminals is unknown as their peripheral target was outside of the ssTEM volume. For the interneuron classes (hugin-PC and hugin-VNC), we found SCVs at larger presynaptic sites, indicating that they employ classic neurotransmitter in addition to the hugin peptide (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Hugin-PC and hugin-VNC neurons\u2019 projections represent mixed synaptic input-output compartments as they both showed pre- as well as postsynaptic sites along their neurites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>)."

To address this, we checked for one of the most abundantly expressed neurotransmitter in the <i>Drosophila</i> nervous system: acetylcholine (ACh) (<a href=\"#bib118\">Yasuyama and Salvaterra, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Salvaterra and Kitamoto, 2001</a>). In the past, immunohistochemical and promoter expression analyses of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the biosynthetic enzyme for ACh, were successfully used to demonstrate cholinergic transmission (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barnstedt et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Miyamoto, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib117\">Yapici et al., 2016</a>). We used both, anti-ChAT antibody as well as a ChAT promoter analysis, and investigated co-localization with hugin neurons. In the EM data, we found hugin neurons to have comparatively few SCVs, suggesting only low amounts of small transmitters. In addition, ChAT is preferentially localized in the neuropil and less so in the somas (<a href=\"#bib93\">S\u00e1mano et al., 2006</a>). Consistent with this, we found that ChAT immunoreactivity in hugin cell bodies was relatively low and varied strongly between samples. Therefore, we quantified the anti-ChAT signal to show that while ChAT levels were in some cases indiscernible from the background, overall highest levels of ChAT were found in hugin-PC and hugin-VNC/PH neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Note that while hugin-PC and hugin-RG neurons were easily identifiable based on position and morphology, hugin-PH and hugin-VNC neurons usually clustered too tightly to be unambiguously discriminated and were thus treated as a single mixed group. Similar to the immunohistochemical analysis, the ChAT promoter (ChAT-GAL4) drove expression of a fluorescent reporter in all hugin-PC neurons plus a subset of hugin-VNC/PH neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Hugin-RG showed weak ChAT signal with either method, consistent with these neurons lacking SCVs in the EM data."

ChAT immunoreactivity was variable but strongest signals were found in hugin-PC and hugin-VNC/PH neurons. Similarly, ChAT-GAL4 consistently drove expression in hugin-PC and subsets of hugin-VNC/PH. Shown are exemplary scans and quantification of ChAT co-localization in the different hugin classes. Note that while hugin-PC and hugin-RG neurons are easily identifiable, hugin-PH and hugin-VNC neurons were usually too close to be unambiguously discriminated and were thus treated as a single mixed group. Each data point in the dot plots represents a single hugin neuron. Horizontal lines mark median. (<b>C</b>,<b>D</b>) ACh is necessary for the effect of hugin neurons\u2019 activation on food intake (<b>C</b>) and pharyngeal pumping (<b>D</b>). Food intake was measured in intact larvae. Pharyngeal pumping was monitored by extracellular recordings of the antennal nerve (AN) and analyzed with respect to the cycle frequency of the motor patterns. Activation of hugin neurons using the thermosensitive cation channel dTrpA1 (HugS3-GAL4 x UAS-dTrpA1) led to a decrease in food intake and pharyngeal pump activity compared to the control (OrgR, OrgR x UAS-dTrpA1). Knockdown of either the hugin neuropeptide or ChAT but not LacZ control (UAS-dTrpA1;HugS3-GAL4 x UAS-RNAi) rescued the effect of hugin neuron activation on food intake as well as on pharyngeal pumping.

Here, we present the knockdown of ChAT using an established UAS-ChAT-RNAi line (<a href=\"#bib76\">Pla\u00e7ais et al., 2013</a>; see Materials and methods). Under unimpeded conditions (i.e., without ChAT knockdown), activation of hugin neurons leads to severe decrease of food intake in intact larvae. This decrease in food intake was rescued by knockdown of ChAT in hugin neurons to a similar degree as the knockdown of the hugin neuropeptide itself (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

As for the food intake, knockdown of ChAT in hugin neurons also rescued the suppressive effect of hugin neuron activation on pharyngeal pumping (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

To this end, we reconstructed 177 pre- and postsynaptic partners of hugin neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, see Materials and methods for details). First, we found that neurons of the same hugin class were connected to the same pre- and postsynaptic partners. Furthermore, most synaptic partners were connected exclusively to neurons of a single hugin class (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Second, pre- and postsynaptic partners of each hugin class resided in different parts of the CNS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). For hugin-RG and hugin-PH, the vast majority of synapses were made with interneurons, 93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04% and 97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03%, respectively.

In addition, subsets of hugin neurons were recently shown to be responsive to gustatory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib35\">H\u00fcckesfeld et al., 2016</a>). We therefore searched for sensory inputs to hugin neurons and found a total of 68 afferent neurons that made synaptic contacts onto hugin neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Two major groups emerged: a larger, morphologically heterogeneous group consisting of afferent neurons projecting through one of the pharyngeal nerves (the antennal nerve) and, unexpectedly, a second, more homogeneous group entering the CNS through abdominal (but not thoracic) nerves. We observed that the reconstructed afferent presynaptic partners of hugin neurons covered different parts of the SEZ. Thus, we sought to cluster these afferent neurons by computing the similarity in spatial distribution of their synaptic sites, termed synapse similarity score."

To address the issue of the origin of identified sensory inputs, we compared our data with previous descriptions of larval sensory neurons. It is well established that abdominal nerves innervate internal and external sensory organs of the peripheral nervous system. This includes proprioceptive (chordotonal), tactile, nociceptive (multi dendritic neurons) and a range of sensory neurons whose function is still unknown (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hwang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ghysen et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bodmer and Jan, 1987</a>). To our knowledge, no abdominal sensory neurons with projections into the SEZ such as the one observed presynaptic to hugin have been described. However, the majority of afferent neurons synapsing onto hugin neurons stems from the antennal nerve. This pharyngeal nerve carries the axons of gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) from internal pharyngeal sensilla as well as those of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and other GRNs from the external sensory organs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Colomb et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</a>).

We thus compared our clustered groups with previously defined light microscopy-based gustatory compartments of the SEZ (<a href=\"#bib19\">Colomb, 2007</a>). Groups 2 and 6, which cover the anterior-medial SEZ, likely correspond to two areas described as the target of GRNs from internal pharyngeal sensilla only (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The remaining groups were either not previously described or difficult to unambiguously align with known areas. Our division into groups is also reflected at the level of their connectivity to hugin neurons: sensory neurons of group 1 have synaptic connections to both hugin-PC and hugin-VNC neurons. Groups 2\u20135, encompassing the previously described pharyngeal sensilla, are almost exclusively connected to hugin-PC neurons. Group 6 sensory neurons make few synapses onto hugin-RG neurons.

In contrast, the interneuron type hugin neurons, hugin-PC and hugin-VNC, receive a significant fraction of their individual incoming synaptic connections (up to 39%) from sensory neurons. Summarizing, we found two out of four types of hugin neurons to receive synaptic input from a large heterogeneous but separable population of sensory neurons, many of which are GRNs from external and internal sensory organs. Hugin-PC neurons were recently shown to be activated by bitter gustatory stimuli but not salt, fructose or yeast (<a href=\"#bib35\">H\u00fcckesfeld et al., 2016</a>). Our data strongly suggests that this activation is at least partially based on monosynaptic connections to GRNs. Moreover, the heterogeneity among the population of sensory neurons suggests that hugin-PC neurons do not merely function as simple relay station but rather fulfill an integrative function, for example between multiple yet-to-be-identified modalities or various external and internal sensory organs."

Among the mNSCs, IPCs have been best studied: they have ipsilateral descending arborizations into the SEZ and project contralaterally into the ring gland (<a href=\"#bib81\">Rulifson et al., 2002</a>). In contrast, morphology of DH44- or DMS-producing mNSCs has been described in less detail. Our reconstruction showed that all reconstructed mNSCs have the exact same features, rendering them morphologically indistinguishable (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). To assign identities to the reconstructed mNSCs, we hypothesized that similar to hugin neurons, the three types of mNSCs would differ in their choice of synaptic partners. We therefore reconstructed all presynaptic partners and calculated the connectivity similarity score between the mNSCs. Clustering with this similarity in connectivity resulted in three groups comprising 3, 2, and 7 neurons, coinciding with the number of neurons of the known types of mNSCs. We thus suggest that the group of three represents DH44-producing cells, the group of two represents DMS-producing cells and the group of seven represents the IPCs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>)."

Overall, synapses between hugin-PC neurons onto mNSCs constitute a large fraction of their respective synaptic connections (hugin-PC: up to 35%; mNSCs: up to 17%). In support of a tight interconnection between hugin neurons and these neuroendocrine neurons, we found that most of hugin-PC neurons\u2019 presynaptic partners are also presynaptic to mNSCs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). These findings demonstrate that the neuroendocrine system is a major target of hugin neurons."

                                "text": "Unlike the small molecule messengers used for fast synaptic transmission, neuropeptides \u2013 such as hugin \u2013 are thought to be released independent of synaptic membrane specializations and are able to diffuse a considerable distance before binding their respective receptors. However, it has been proposed that neuropeptides released from most neurons act locally on cells that are either synaptically connected or immediately adjacent (<a href=\"#bib100\">van den Pol 2012</a>). We therefore asked whether the synaptic connections between hugin-PC neurons and mNSCs would have a matching peptide-receptor connection. The <i>hugin</i> gene encodes a prepropeptide that is post-translationally processed to produce an eight-amino-acid neuropeptide, termed pyrokinin-2 (hug-PK2) or hugin neuropeptide (<a href=\"#bib58\">Meng et al., 2002</a>). This hugin neuropeptide has been shown to activate the <i>Drosophila</i> G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) CG8784/PK2-R1 in mammalian cell systems, but the identities of the target neurons expressing the receptor remain unknown (<a href=\"#bib80\">Rosenkilde et al., 2003</a>). To address this, we used two independent methods to generate transgenic fly lines, <i>CG8784-GAL4::p65</i> and <i>CG8784-6kb-GAL4</i>, driving expression under control of putative <i>CG8784</i> regulatory sequences (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Both <i>CG8784-GAL4</i> lines drive expression of a GFP reporter in a prominent cluster of cells in the pars intercerebralis. Double stainings show that this expression co-localizes with the peptides produced by the three types of mNSCs: Dilp2, DH44, and DMS (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013D</a>; <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To support the receptor expression data, we performed calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) imaging of the mNSCs upon treatment with hug-PK2 (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Indeed, calcium activity of the mNSCs increased significantly after treatment with concentrations of 1 \u00b5M hug-PK2 or higher. These findings support the hypothesis that hugin-PC neurons employ both classical synaptic transmission and peptidergic signaling to target neurons of the neuroendocrine center."

This enabled us to identify and reconstruct a set of 20 peptidergic neurons in an ssTEM volume spanning an entire larval CNS (<a href=\"#bib70\">Ohyama et al., 2015</a>). These neurons produce the neuropeptide hugin and have previously been grouped into four classes based on their projection targets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bader</a>\u00a0<a href=\"#bib3\">\u00a0et al., 2007a</a>). We found that neurons of the same morphological class (a) were very similar with respect to the distribution of synaptic sites, (b) shared a large fraction of their pre- and postsynaptic partners and (c) in case of the interneuron classes (hugin-PC and hugin-VNC), neurons were reciprocally connected along their axons with other neurons of the same class. This raises the question why the CNS sustains multiple copies of morphologically very similar neurons. Comparable features have been described for a population of neurons which produce crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib43\">Karsai et al., 2013</a>). The reciprocal connections as well as the overlap in synaptic partners suggest that the activity of neurons within each interneuron class is likely coordinately regulated and could help sustain persistent activity within the population. In the mammalian pyramidal network of the medial prefrontal cortex, reciprocal connectivity between neurons is thought to contribute to the network\u2019s robustness by synchronizing activity within subpopulations and to support persistent activity (<a href=\"#bib109\">Wang et al., 2006</a>). Similar interconnectivity and shared synaptic inputs have also been demonstrated for peptidergic neurons producing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and oxytocin in the hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib14\">Campbell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Theodosis, 2002</a>).

For hugin-RG or hugin-PH such specific functional effects have not yet been described (for summary see <b><a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)</b>. One conceivable scenario would be that each hugin class mediates specific aspects of an overarching 'hugin phenotype'. This would require that under physiological conditions all hugin classes are coordinately active. However, we did not find any evidence of such coordination on the level of synaptic connectivity. Instead, each hugin class forms an independent microcircuit with its own unique set of pre- and postsynaptic partners. We thus predict that each class of hugin-producing neurons has a distinct context and function in which it is relevant for the organism."

While hugin-PC neurons are known to play a role in gustatory processing, there is no detailed study of this aspect for hugin-VNC or hugin-RG neurons (<a href=\"#bib35\">H\u00fcckesfeld et al., 2016</a>). Sensory inputs to hugin neurons are very heterogeneous, which suggests that they have an integrative/processing rather than a simple relay function."

For hugin-PC, we have demonstrated that this effect is mediated by both synaptic and hugin peptide transmissions. For hugin-VNC, this effect is independent of the hugin neuropeptide, suggesting synaptic transmission to play a key role (<a href=\"#bib86\">Schoofs et al., 2014</a>). Suprisingly, we did not find any direct synaptic connections to the relevant motor neurons. However, the kinetics of the effects of hugin neurons on motor systems have not yet been studied at a high enough temporal resolution (i.e. by intracellular recordings) to assume monosynaptic connections. It is thus well conceivable that connections to the respective motor systems are polysynaptic and occur further downstream. Alternatively, this may involve an additional non-synaptic (peptidergic) step. A strong candidate for this is the neuroendocrine system which we identify as the major downstream target of hugin-PC neurons. Among the endocrine targets of hugin, the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) have long been known to centrally regulate feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib22\">Erion and Sehgal, 2013</a>). It is not known if insulin-signaling directly affects motor patterns in <i>Drosophila</i>. Nevertheless, increased insulin signaling has strong inhibitory effects on food-related sensory processing and feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib116\">Wu et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib115\">Wu et al., 2005b</a>). Whether the neuroendocrine system is a mediator of the suppressive effects of hugin-PC neurons on food intake remains to be determined."

One of the main reasons for this is the smaller behavioral repertoire of the larva: the lack of all but the most fundamental behaviors makes it well suited to address basic questions. Nevertheless, it stands to reason that elementary circuits should be conserved between larval and adult flies. To date, there is no systematic comparison of hugin across the life cycle of <i>Drosophila</i>. However, there is indication that hugin neurons retain their functionality from larva to the adult fly. First, morphology of hugin neurons remains virtually the same between larva and adults (<a href=\"#bib57\">Melcher and Pankratz, 2005</a>). Second, hugin neurons seem to serve similar purposes in both stages: they acts as a brake on feeding behavior \u2013 likely as response to aversive sensory cues (<a href=\"#bib35\">H\u00fcckesfeld et al., 2016</a>). In larvae, artificial activation of this brake shuts down feeding (<a href=\"#bib86\">Schoofs et al., 2014</a>). In adults, removal of this break by silencing of hugin neurons leads to a facilitation (earlier onset) of feeding (<a href=\"#bib57\">Melcher and Pankratz, 2005</a>). Such conservation of neuropeptidergic function between larval and adult <i>Drosophila</i> has been observed only in a few cases. Prominent examples are short (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lee\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2008</a>) and long neuropeptide F (<a href=\"#bib9\">Beshel and Zhong, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Wang et al., 2013</a>), both of which show strong similarities with mammalian NPY. The lack of additional examples is not necessarily due to actual divergence of peptide function but rather due to the lack of data across both larva and adult. Given the wealth of existing data on hugin in larvae, it would be of great interest to investigate whether and to what extent the known features (connectivity, function, etc.) of this system are maintained throughout <i>Drosophila</i>\u2019s life history."

On one hand, this connectivity is based on anatomical connections formed between members of the network, namely synapses and gap junctions. On the other hand, there are non-anatomical connections that do not require physical contact due to the signaling molecules, such as neuropeptides/-hormones, being able to travel considerable distances before binding their receptors (<a href=\"#bib100\">van den Pol, 2012</a>). Our current integrated analysis of the operational framework for a set of neurons genetically defined by the expression of a common neuropeptide, positions hugin-producing neurons as a novel component in the regulation of neuroendocrine activity and the integration of sensory inputs. We show that most hugin neurons receive chemosensory input in the subesophageal zone, the brainstem analog of <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ghysen, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Schoofs et al., 2014</a>). Of these, one class is embedded into a network whose downstream targets are median neurosecretory cells (mNSCs) of the pars intercerebralis, a region homologous to the mammalian hypothalamus (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hartenstein, 2006</a>). We found that hugin neurons target mNSCs by two mechanisms. First, by classic synaptic transmission as our data strongly suggest that acetylcholine (ACh) acts as transmitter at these synapses. Accordingly, subsets of mNSCs have been shown to express a muscarinic ACh receptor (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cao et al., 2014</a>). Whether additional ACh receptors are expressed is unknown. Second, by non-anatomical, neuromodulatory transmission using a peptide-receptor connection, as demonstrated by the expression of hugin G-protein-coupled receptor PK2-R1 (<i>CG8784</i>) in mNSCs. Strikingly, while PK2-R1 is expressed in all mNSCs, the hugin neurons have many synaptic contacts onto insulin-producing cells but few to DMS and DH44 neurons. This mismatch in synaptic vs. peptide targets among the mNSCs suggests an intricate influence of hugin-producing neurons on this neuroendocrine center. In favor of a complex regulation is that those mNSCs that are synaptically connected to hugin neurons additionally express a pyrokinin-1 receptor (PK1-R, <i>CG9918</i>) which, like PK2-R1, is related to mammalian neuromedinU receptors (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alfa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cazzamali et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Park et al., 2002</a>). There is some evidence that PK1-R might also be activated by the hugin neuropeptide, which would add another regulatory layer (<a href=\"#bib17\">Cazzamali, 2005</a>)."

For example, cholinergic transmission plays an important role in mediating the effect of NMU in mammals. This has been demonstrated in the context of anxiety but not yet for feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib97\">Telegdy and Adamik, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Tanaka and Telegdy, 2014</a>). There are, however, only few examples of simultaneous employment of neuromodulation and fast synaptic transmission in which specific targets of both messengers have been investigated at single-cell level. In many cases, targets and effects of classic and peptide co-transmitters seem to diverge (e.g. (<a href=\"#bib91\">Sun\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Li and van den Pol, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Stein et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, AgRP neurons in the mammalian hypothalamus employ neuropeptide Y, the eponymous agouty-related protein (AgRP) and the small molecule transmitter GABA to target pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in order to control energy homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cansell et al., 2012</a>). Also, reminiscent of our observations is the situation in the frog sympathetic ganglia, where preganglionic neurons use both ACh and a neuropeptide to target so-called C cells but only the neuropeptide additionally targets B cells. In both targets, the neuropeptide elicits late, slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Jan and Jan, 1983</a>). It is conceivable that hugin-producing neurons act in a similar manner by exerting a slow, lasting neuromodulatory effect on all mNSCs and a fast, transient effect exclusively on synaptically connected mNSCs. Alternatively, the hugin neuropeptide could facilitate the postsynaptic effect of acetylcholine. Such is the case in <i>Aplysia</i> where a command-like neuron for feeding employs acetylcholine and two neuropeptides, feeding circuit activating peptide (FCAP) and cerebral peptide 2 (CP2). Both peptides work cooperatively on a postsynaptically connected motor neuron to enhance EPSPs in response to cholinergic transmission (<a href=\"#bib45\">Koh et al., 2003</a>)."

It is commonly thought that low-frequency neuronal activity is sufficient to trigger fast transmission using small molecule transmitters, whereas slow transmission employing neuropeptides requires higher frequency activity (<a href=\"#bib67\">Nusbaum et al., 2001</a>). Hugin-producing neurons could employ peptidergic transmission only as a result of strong excitatory (e.g. sensory) input. There are, however, cases in which base activity of neurons is already sufficient for graded neuropeptide release: <i>Aplysia</i> ARC motor neurons employ ACh as well as neuropeptides and ACh is generally released at lower firing rates than the neuropeptide. This allows the motor neuron to function as purely cholinergic when firing slowly and as cholinergic/peptidergic when firing rapidly (<a href=\"#bib113\">Whim and Lloyd, 1989</a>). However, peptide release already occurs at the lower end of the physiological activity of those neurons (<a href=\"#bib112\">Weiss et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Vilim et al., 1996</a>). It remains to be seen how synaptic and peptidergic transmission in hugin neurons relate to each other."

Its two receptors, NMUR1 and NMUR2, show differential expression. NMUR2 is abundant in the brain and the spinal cord, whereas NMUR1 is expressed in peripheral tissues, in particular in the gastrointestinal tract (<a href=\"#bib61\">Mitchell et al., 2009</a>). Both receptors mediate different effects of NMU. The peripheral NMUR1 is expressed in pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells in humans and allows NMU to potently suppress glucose-induced insulin secretion (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alfa et al., 2015</a>). The same study also showed that Limostatin (Lst) is a functional homolog of this peripheral NMU in <i>Drosophila</i>: Lst is expressed by glucose-sensing, gut-associated endocrine cells and suppresses the secretion of insulin-like peptides. The second, centrally expressed NMU receptor, NMUR2, is necessary for the effect of NMU on food intake and physical activity (<a href=\"#bib120\">Zeng et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Peier et al., 2009</a>). In this context, NMU is well established as a factor in regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis (<a href=\"#bib114\">Wren et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Malendowicz et al., 2012</a>) and has a range of effects in the hypothalamus, the most important being the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hanada et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2003</a>). We show that a subset of hugin-producing neurons targets the pars intercerebralis, the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of the hypothalamus, in a similar fashion: neuroendocrine target cells in the pars intercerebralis produce a range of peptides, including diuretic hormone 44 which belongs to the insect CRH-like peptide family (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cabrero et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Given these similarities, we propose that hugin is homologous to central NMU just as Lst is a homologous to peripheral NMU. Demonstration that central NMU and hugin circuits share similar features beyond targeting neuroendocrine centers, e.g. the integration of chemosensory inputs, will require further studies on NMU regulation and connectivity."

                                "text": "Reconstructions were based on an ssTEM (serial section transmission electron microscope) data set comprising an entire central nervous system and the ring gland of a first-instar <i>Drosophila</i> larva. Generation of this data set was described previously (<a href=\"#bib70\">Ohyama et al., 2015</a>). Neurons\u2019 skeletons were manually reconstructed using a modified version of CATMAID (<a href=\"http://www.catmaid.org\">http://www.catmaid.org</a>) (<a href=\"#bib82\">Saalfeld et al., 2009</a>). Hugin-PH (pharynx) neurons were first identified by reconstructing all axons in the prothoracic accessory nerve, through which these neurons exit the CNS toward the pharynx. Similarly, hugin-RG (ring gland) neurons were identified by reconstructing all neurosecretory cells that target the ring gland. To find the remaining hugin neurons, neighbors of already identified hugin neurons were reconstructed. Among those, the remaining hugin neurons were unambiguously identified based on previously described morphological properties such as projection targets, dendritic arborizations, relative position to each other and prominent landmarks like antennal lobes or nerves (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bader\u00a0et al., 2007a</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">Bader et al., 2007b</a>). The mapped synaptic connections represent fast, chemical synapses matching previously described typical criteria: thick black active zones, pre- (e.g. T-bar, vesicles) and postsynaptic membrane specializations (<a href=\"#bib77\">Prokop and Meinertzhagen, 2006</a>). Hugin inputs and outputs were traced by following the pre- and postsynaptically connected neurites to the respective neurons\u2019 somata or nerve entry sites in sensory axons. Subsequently, all sensory and endocrine neurons synaptically connected to hugin neurons were fully reconstructed. Interneurons were fully reconstructed if (a) homologous neurons were found in both hemispheres/-segments (did not apply to medially unpaired neurons) and (b) at least one of the paired neurons was connected by a minimum of three synapses to/from hugin neurons. Neurons that did not fit either criterion were not fully reconstructed and thus excluded from statistical analysis. This resulted in the reconstruction 177 synaptic partners that together covered 90%/96% of hugin neurons' above threshold pre-/postsynaptic sites (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The same parameters were applied to the reconstruction of synaptic partners of median neurosecretory cells (mNSCs). Morphological plots and example synapse's volume reconstruction were generated using custom python scripts or scripts for Blender 3D (<a href=\"http://www.blender.org\">www.blender.org</a>). The script for a CATMAID-Blender interface is on Github (<a href=\"https://github.com/schlegelp/CATMAID-to-Blender\">https://github.com/schlegelp/CATMAID-to-Blender</a>). See supplemental neuron atlas (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary files 1</a>,<a href=\"#SD2-data\">2</a>) of all reconstructed neurons and their connectivity with hugin neurons."

The neuron reconstructions and the analysis of connectivity are an impressive body of work. The authors combined it with the detailed analysis of the chemical connectivity of one class of hugin-producing neurons and their targets expressing the GPCR for hugin. The possibility of directly correlating individual neurons in light microscopy samples to the EM volume allowed the analysis of such molecular connectivity in the circuit at a cellular resolution. The 20 hugin neurons make up 4 distinct microcircuits: the activity of each of these is likely to underlie distinct features of feeding behavior."

These project to the VNC, PC and RG, but there are no hugin+ somata in these regions. The authors compare the projections of the hugin neurons to the distinct sets of NMU+ neurons in vertebrates.

For example, the extent to which the influence of the hugin neurons, and particularly that of any one of the 4 modules, mimics the previously documented behavioral consequences of genetically manipulating the presence of the hugin peptide remains to be determined. Also, the proposed target neurons of neuronally released hugin peptide are the likely but not necessarily actual target neurons, despite the presynaptic presence of hugin peptide and postsynaptic presence of hugin receptors. This is because 1) the peptide release sites are not known, other than that they are not released into a synaptic cleft, 2) peptide access to receptors is unknowable from anatomy alone, 3) there might be additional, not yet identified hugin receptors, and 4) the presence of receptors alone does not prove a functional relationship because those receptors might be present to bind instead with different members of that peptide family released from other neurons. Concisely, anatomical results suggest but cannot prove functional consequences of peptidergic transmission.

To claim circuit homology without even knowing the circuitry in a vertebrate is even more problematic.

Hugin-PC neurons project to the pars intercerebralis and synapse on neurosecretory cells. These connections are analyzed in detail in the paper. The pars intercerebralis cells express a hugin receptor and are activated by pharmacologically applied hugin. However, it is not clear if these connections are involved in the regulation of feeding or not. The authors show that hugin-PCs also have outputs in the SEZ (unknown interneurons), a center that houses the basic neuronal circuits generating feeding behavior. This suggests that the physiological role of the connection between hugin-PCs and the pars intercerebralis neurons is unknown. The authors should at least speculate about the role of these neurosecretory neurons in the context of feeding/locomotion.

For example, the extent to which the influence of the hugin neurons, and particularly that of any one of the 4 modules, mimics the previously documented behavioral consequences of genetically manipulating the presence of the hugin peptide remains to be determined. Also, the proposed target neurons of neuronally released hugin peptide are the likely but not necessarily actual target neurons, despite the presynaptic presence of hugin peptide and postsynaptic presence of hugin receptors. This is because 1) the peptide release sites are not known, other than that they are not released into a synaptic cleft, 2) peptide access to receptors is unknowable from anatomy alone, 3) there might be additional, not yet identified hugin receptors, and 4) the presence of receptors alone does not prove a functional relationship because those receptors might be present to bind instead with different members of that peptide family released from other neurons.

Similarly, other issues of this type would benefit from a slight change in the precision of the wording.</i>"

Are there truly axo-axonic connections (as this type of connection is classical defined in the literature) onto hugin neurons? This type of synapse commonly refers to synaptic sites located close to specific transmitter release sites at axon terminals/boutons, where the axo-axonic synapse selectively influences only that transmitter release site and possibly nearby sites. These types of synapses are also electrotonically distant/isolated from the population of synaptic inputs which collectively determine whether or not the target neuron will fire an action potential, so they are not part of the synaptic integration mechanism that determines neuronal activity. There appears to be no explicit segregation in the text regarding axonal membrane vs. \"synaptic integration membrane\" or what would be called dendritic membrane in a vertebrate. However, as is common in invertebrate nervous systems, the hugin neurons do have neuropilar membrane on which there is an intermingling of inputs and outputs, as indicated in the second paragraph of the Results section.</i>"
