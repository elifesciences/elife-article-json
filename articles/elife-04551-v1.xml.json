Inputs to proximal dendrites usually produce large somatic EPSPs that efficiently trigger action potential (AP) output whereas inputs to distal dendrites are greatly attenuated and may largely modulate AP output. In contrast to most other cortical and hippocampal neurons, hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons show unusually strong excitation by their distal dendritic inputs from entorhinal cortex (EC). Here we demonstrate that the ability of these EC inputs to drive CA2 AP output requires the firing of local dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes. Furthermore we find that CA2 dendritic geometry contributes to the efficient coupling of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> spikes to AP output. These results provide a striking example of how dendritic spikes enable direct cortical inputs to overcome unfavorable distal synaptic locale to trigger axonal AP output, and thereby enable efficient cortico-hippocampal information flow."
