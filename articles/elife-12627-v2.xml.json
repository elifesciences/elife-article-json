Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), an emerging pathogen of this order of viruses (<i>Mononegavirales</i>) is one of the main causes of respiratory tract illness in children. To help elucidate the assembly mechanism of the nucleocapsid (the viral RNA genome packaged by the nucleoprotein N) we present crystallographic structures of HMPV N in its assembled RNA-bound state and in a monomeric state, bound to the polymerase cofactor P. Our structures reveal molecular details of how P inhibits the self-assembly of N and how N transitions between the RNA-free and RNA-bound conformational state. Notably, we observe a role for the C-terminal extension of N in directly preventing premature uptake of RNA by folding into the RNA-binding cleft. Our structures suggest a common mechanism of how the growth of the nucleocapsid is orchestrated, and highlight an interaction site representing an important target for antivirals."

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), an emerging pathogen of this order of viruses (<i>Mononegavirales</i>) is one of the main causes of respiratory tract illness in children. To help elucidate the assembly mechanism of the nucleocapsid (the viral RNA genome packaged by the nucleoprotein N) we present crystallographic structures of HMPV N in its assembled RNA-bound state and in a monomeric state, bound to the polymerase cofactor P. Our structures reveal molecular details of how P inhibits the self-assembly of N and how N transitions between the RNA-free and RNA-bound conformational state. Notably, we observe a role for the C-terminal extension of N in directly preventing premature uptake of RNA by folding into the RNA-binding cleft. Our structures suggest a common mechanism of how the growth of the nucleocapsid is orchestrated, and highlight an interaction site representing an important target for antivirals."

As for all viruses, HMPV cannot survive on its own. Instead, it must invade and hijack cells in order to replicate its own genetic material and form new viruses. In HMPV, this genetic information is in the form of a strand of RNA, and is protected by a shell-like structure called a nucleocapsid. Drugs that disrupt the nucleocapsid may therefore help to kill the viruses and treat the illnesses that they cause."

However, viral nucleocapsids can only be built from nucleoproteins that are bound to viral RNA. Potentially, nucleoproteins could instead bind to RNA belonging to the cells that HMPV infects and they would then be trapped in a dead-end state. To prevent this type of unproductive binding, before the nucleocapsid is formed the nucleoprotein is kept unassembled with the help of another protein called the polymerase cofactor. However, it was not clear exactly how the polymerase cofactor helps to maintain this unassembled state."

Comparing these structures revealed that RNA normally binds to a specific cleft in the nucleoprotein. However, when nucleoprotein is bound to the polymerase cofactor a portion of the nucleoprotein folds into this cleft instead, blocking the insertion of RNA. This prevents the nucleoprotein from associating with the wrong RNA, allowing the nucleoprotein to remain in an unassembled state until it is needed for the virus."

Notable members belonging to this group of viruses (<i>Mononegavirales</i>) include measles, rabies, Ebola, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Human metapneumovirus (HMPV). HMPV (<i>Paramyxoviridae</i>, subfamily <i>Pneumovirinae</i>) is a leading cause of serious respiratory tract infections in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boivin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Osterhaus and Fouchier, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">van den Hoogen et al., 2001</a>). In all members of the <i>Mononegavirales</i>, the RNA genome is packaged in the form of a nucleocapsid, a ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of polymerized viral nucleoproteins (N) and RNA (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ruigrok et al., 2011</a>). Besides protecting the viral genome from host nucleases, the nucleocapsid serves as the template for transcription by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L. Nucleocapsid assembly necessitates a pool of monomeric, RNA-free N, termed N<sup>0</sup>, which is kept in an unassembled state through an interaction with an N-terminal portion of the polymerase cofactor P, until delivered to the sites of viral RNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ruigrok et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Curran et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Mavrakis et al., 2006</a>). The P protein is a multifunctional, modular protein containing large intrinsically disordered regions and is found to be tetrameric in HMPV (<a href=\"#bib19\">Leyrat et al., 2013</a>). In addition, P binds to the nucleocapsid via its C\u2013terminus, and mediates the attachment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L. Furthermore in pneumoviruses, P recruits the processivity factor M2-1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Leyrat et al., 2014</a>). A great deal of effort has been spent on understanding the functions of P and recent crystal structures of P bound to N proteins (N<sup>0</sup>-P) from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and measles virus have highlighted its role in preventing assembly of N by blocking the C-terminal and N-terminal extensions of N (CTD-arm and NTD-arm) which facilitate N oligomerization (<a href=\"#bib21\">Leyrat et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Guryanov et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Leung et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Yabukarski et al., 2014</a>). However, there is still paucity in our understanding of the molecular details behind the proposed mechanisms, specifically regarding how P-bound N is released, attaches to the nucleocapsid and is loaded with RNA. To address these questions in the mechanism of N-chaperoning by P and nucleocapsid assembly we performed a structural analysis of assembled and unassembled N from HMPV. Our structure of N<sup>0</sup>-P reveals a conformational change, in which the negatively charged CTD-arm of N occupies the positively charged RNA binding site via specific and conserved interactions. Together with our RNA-bound structure of N these data imply a mechanism of how the growth of nucleocapsid filaments is coordinated in HMPV and related viruses."

                        "text": "Biochemical studies of the nucleocapsid building block N are complicated by the fact that N proteins have a strong tendency to irreversibly oligomerize and bind host nucleic acids immediately upon recombinant expression (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gutsche et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Tawar et al., 2009</a>). One technique to mitigate this problem is to truncate regions of N that facilitate oligomerization (<a href=\"#bib36\">Yabukarski et al., 2014</a>). To stabilize monomeric full-length N<sup>0</sup> we fused the N-terminal domain of P to N, a strategy that has seen success with nucleoproteins from other viruses (<a href=\"#bib13\">Guryanov et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kirchdoerfer et al., 2015</a>). We obtained crystals of RNA-free HMPV N in a monomeric state and bound to a P peptide at 1.9\u2009\u00c5 resolution by adding trace amounts of trypsin (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dong et al., 2007</a>) to prune flexible loops and promote crystallization (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In the structure, the P peptide is firmly nestled into a hydrophobic surface of the C-terminal domain of N (CTD) primarily composed of \u03b1-helices \u03b1C1 and \u03b1C2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Ile9, Leu10 and Phe11 of P occupy key positions and insert into this hydrophobic groove (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Unlike the N<sup>0</sup>-P structure recently reported for measles (<a href=\"#bib13\">Guryanov et al., 2015</a>), we find that the linker connecting N and P in our chimeric construct has been cleaved prior to crystal growth. The P peptide wraps around the CTD and residues 12\u201328 form an alpha helix that lies atop N (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This helix is initiated at Gly12 and pinned to the CTD through an aromatic side-to-face interaction of Phe23 with Tyr354 of N, both residues belonging to the so-called mir motif which is conserved within <i>Pneumovirinae</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Karlin and Belshaw, 2012</a>). This result is consistent with an earlier study, in which alanine mutations of the corresponding residues in respiratory syncytial virus resulted in a drop of polymerase activity by more than 75% in a minireplicon system (<a href=\"#bib11\">Galloux et al., 2015</a>)."

To this end, we purified and crystallized assembled HMPV N in the form of a decameric N-RNA ring (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). By exploiting the ten-fold non-crystallographic symmetry in the rings, we were able to obtain excellent electron density maps at 4.2-\u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>) and build a reliable model (<a href=\"#bib16\">Karplus and Diederichs, 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Assembled HMPV decameric N-RNA rings are ~0.5 MDa in molecular mass and 160\u2009\u00c5 in diameter and 70\u2009\u00c5 in height (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The observed RNA binding mode is similar to that seen in the related RSV N-RNA structure (<a href=\"#bib31\">Tawar et al., 2009</a>). The RNA wraps around the N ring and wedges tightly in the cleft between the NTD and CTD of N, which is lined by positively charged residues (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In members of the <i>Paramyxovirinae</i>, the number of nucleotides in the viral genome is required to be a multiple of six (<a href=\"#bib5\">Calain and Roux, 1993</a>) and the structural basis for this so-called rule of six has been elucidated recently (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gutsche et al., 2015</a>). In members of the <i>Pneumovirinae</i>, however, this rule is not observed (<a href=\"#bib31\">Tawar et al., 2009</a>). Our structure further highlights this difference; with each N subunit contacting seven RNA nucleotides (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>)."

Comparison of these two states for HMPV reveals a rigid body movement of the NTD relative to the CTD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The conformational change rotates the NTD towards the CTD by 10\u00b0, the interface between the two domains acting as a hinge. At the interface, hinge residues Thr257 and Ala254 play a particularly crucial role. In the open, RNA-free state the hinge is maintained in a helical conformation by stabilization of Ala254 through the side chain of Thr257 and an additional backbone interaction with Thr175 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Upon RNA binding, Thr257 contacts the backbone of a nucleotide instead of stabilizing Ala254 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). In addition, the loop containing Thr157 retracts to sterically accommodate the RNA chain. Having lost the stabilizing contacts of Thr257 and Thr157, the helical hinge region around Ala254 unravels and becomes flexible (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, indicated by white arrow), allowing the relative domain motions of NTD and CTD. Furthermore, we propose that Tyr252 is important in facilitating the hinge motion. Tyr252 is positioned just before the pivot point and packs tightly against \u03b1C3 (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). An aromatic residue at this position is found packing against the same helix in most known structures of N (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B\u2013G</a>). Transition from the RNA-free to RNA-bound state induces a rotation of \u03b1C3, exerting upwards pressure on Tyr252 that is conferred onto the NTD (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). Intriguingly, in structures of <i>Paramyxovirinae</i> N, which obey the rule-of-six, this aromatic is flipped in the opposite direction (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4H,I</a>) and contacts RNA (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gutsche et al., 2015</a>), suggesting a similar coupling of RNA-binding and hinge-motion in these viruses."

                        "text": "The most profound changes between assembled and unassembled states, however, involve the CTD-arm of N, a region that has been little characterized in pneumoviruses. In the polymeric, RNA-bound state of N (N-RNA) the CTD-arm flips upwards and latches onto the next protomer, whilst in the monomeric state (N<sup>0</sup>) it packs down against the core of N (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The downward, monomeric conformation is stabilized by specific salt-bridges linking the CTD-arm with the core of N (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In this position the negatively charged CTD-arm\u00a0folds\u00a0into the positively charged RNA binding cleft, occupying it and directly blocking the binding of RNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). It is interesting to note, that whilst the CTD-arm blocks the RNA site in HMPV, it is the P peptide that inserts itself there in VSV (<a href=\"#bib21\">Leyrat et al., 2011</a>). Because this is not observed in paramyxoviral N<sup>0</sup>-P complexes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Guryanov et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Yabukarski et al., 2014</a>) we hypothesize that, in <i>Rhabdoviridae</i>, a different strategy has evolved to block off the RNA binding cleft. The question arises how the interactions that hold the downwards-positioned CTD-arm in place are broken when assembly of N-RNA necessitates it flipping into the upwards position. In the RNA-free state, Arg260 and Trp261 contact Glu375, while Arg186 forms a salt-bridge with Asp373 of the CTD-arm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In the assembled, RNA-bound state these interactions are broken, with Arg186 and Trp261 now positioning RNA nucleotides in the cleft, whilst Arg260 instead fastens onto the NTD-arm of the neighbouring N<sub>i+1</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The shift from initial stabilization of the inhibitory (downwards) CTD-arm conformation to stabilization of bound RNA and neighbouring N subunit implies that attachment of a new N protomer and insertion of nascent RNA occur concomitantly. This makes sense in the context of viral replication sites, where tetrameric P proteins act as molecular chaperones attaching to the nucleocapsid template, polymerase and free N<sup>0</sup>, leading to high local concentrations of nucleoprotein and RNA."

In our model, this is driven by the formation of new interactions to the NTD- and CTD arms and, importantly, the concerted insertion of nascent RNA into the RNA binding cleft of N<sub>i</sub>, with the CTD-arm switching into the upward conformation. In this model the growth of the filament is reminiscent of a zipper closing up with one row of teeth corresponding to nascent viral RNA and the other to newly delivered N subunits which interdigitate in a fluid, concerted motion. The notion that concerted RNA insertion is required for the hand-over of N subunits from P lends additional specificity to the nucleocapsid polymerization reaction."

The resulting hybrid construct was cloned into POPINE as described above and verified by sequencing. Protein expression was carried out as described for N, above. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20\u2009mM Tris, pH 7, 1M NaCl, lysed by sonication and the lysate was subsequently centrifuged (4\u00b0C, 45\u2009min, 50000 x g). The supernatant was purified using a column containing pre-equilibrated Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA agarose and elution was carried out using 20\u2009mM Tris, pH 7, 1M NaCl, 300\u2009mM imidazole. The protein was then buffer exchanged into 20\u2009mM Tris, pH 7, 100\u00a0mM NaCl and loaded onto a HiTrap Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare) for further purification using a stepwise NaCl gradient. Finally, the N0-P hybrid was gel-filtrated using a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20\u2009mM Tris, pH 7, 100\u2009mM NaCl, and concentrated to ~7 mg/mL for crystallization."

The method (reviewed in Sivaraman et al., 2013) is well-established and has been successfully used on a variety of systems, including MHC-receptors and, indeed, viral nucleoproteins (e.g. Kirchdoerfer et al., 2015). Due to the inherent propensity to form oligomeric assemblies such tricks are absolutely necessary for the study of N. The referees categorically denote the method as being artificial but offer no specific criticisms to the structure at hand. Similarly, the use of limited proteolytic digestion is a very common technique in crystallography to facilitate the pruning of flexible loops and thus promote crystallization (Dong et al., 2007). It seems that the major criticism of the referees was that we utilized two common and established techniques which happen to be unfamiliar to them. Indeed, we can bring forward several points that confirm our N0-P structure is correctly folded, even though this should not be necessary: ( (1)) the binding site of P is in line with previous functional studies (Galloux et al., 2015), as mentioned in the manuscript, ( (2)) the P-site is also in line with structures of related viruses, ( (3)) the linker between N and P is cleaved by the in-situ proteolysis yielding non-covalently bound P which should completely negate this point of contention, ( (4)) the overall fold of N follows other N proteins. We therefore cannot understand why our structure is deemed artificial and would like to challenge the referees to bring forward specific criticisms. We addressed the criticisms in our manuscript and explain the rationale of using a chimeric protein and proteolytic digestion. We have also addressed the criticism of data/model quality for our N-RNA structure by including CC*, CCwork and CCfree statistics by resolution shell (Karplus and Diederichs, 2012)."

At the point of review, to our best knowledge, there was no instance where an assembled N-RNA and monomeric N0 -P structure was available for the same virus. The only instance where this might be contended is for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). However, in this case both structures form oligomeric, assembled rings that are conformationally identical (Leyrat et al., 2011). We could thus, for the first time, analyse the structural transition without having to resort to qualitative comparisons with phylogenetically distant homologues. Similar to major comment #1 the referees unfairly dismissed our claims without specific criticism. We would like to challenge them to show us for which virus they think monomeric N0 -P and assembled N-RNA was available during review. However, during to the lengthy review process, the measles virus N0 -P was published (Guryanov et al., 2015, published online on December 30), meaning that we cannot make the contended claim anymore. To quote the manuscript by Guryanov et al: \"Here, for the first time in Paramyxovirus research, our data allow direct comparison of the structure of the nucleoprotein from the same virus in two functional states: a P-bound naive state, and an RNA-bound helical assembly.\" Consequently, although they were true during the review stage, we have now removed these claims of precedence."
