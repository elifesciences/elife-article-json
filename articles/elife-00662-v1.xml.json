Infections are typically treated with azole inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis often leading to drug resistance. Studies in clinical isolates have implicated multiple mechanisms in resistance, but have focused on large-scale aberrations or candidate genes, and do not comprehensively chart the genetic basis of adaptation. Here, we leveraged next-generation sequencing to analyze 43 isolates from 11 oral candidiasis patients. We detected newly selected mutations, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy-number variations and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events. LOH events were commonly associated with acquired resistance, and SNPs in 240 genes may be related to host adaptation. Conversely, most aneuploidies were transient and did not correlate with drug resistance. Our analysis also shows that isolates also varied in adherence, filamentation, and virulence. Our work reveals new molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of drug resistance and host adaptation."

Infections are typically treated with azole inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis often leading to drug resistance. Studies in clinical isolates have implicated multiple mechanisms in resistance, but have focused on large-scale aberrations or candidate genes, and do not comprehensively chart the genetic basis of adaptation. Here, we leveraged next-generation sequencing to analyze 43 isolates from 11 oral candidiasis patients. We detected newly selected mutations, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy-number variations and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events. LOH events were commonly associated with acquired resistance, and SNPs in 240 genes may be related to host adaptation. Conversely, most aneuploidies were transient and did not correlate with drug resistance. Our analysis also shows that isolates also varied in adherence, filamentation, and virulence. Our work reveals new molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of drug resistance and host adaptation."

However, resistance to the azoles arises within the commensal population of the treated individual, primarily because azoles are fungistatic (inhibit growth but do not kill) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cowen et al., 2002</a>). Epidemiological data suggest that the intensity of fluconazole use is driving the appearance of resistant isolates (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pfaller et al., 1998</a>). Studies of clinical isolates of <i>C. albicans</i> suggest that drug resistance can increase during an infection through the acquisition of aneuploidies (<a href=\"#bib75\">Selmecki et al., 2009</a>) due to genomic plasticity and rapid evolutionary selection during infection."

First, increased activity or level of the enzymes of the ergosterol pathway (e.g., <i>ERG11</i>) reduces direct impact of the drug on its target (<a href=\"#bib3\">Asai et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Oliver et al., 2007</a>). Second, increased efflux of the drug from cells by ABC transporters (encoded by <i>CDR1</i> and <i>CDR2</i>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Coste et al., 2006</a>) or by the major facilitator superfamily efflux pump (encoded by <i>MDR1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dunkel et al., 2008</a>) reduces the effective intracellular drug concentration. In both cases, such alterations can result from point mutations in genes encoding these proteins (<a href=\"#bib50\">Marichal et al., 1999</a>), in transcription factors that regulate mRNA expression levels (<a href=\"#bib48\">MacPherson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Coste et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dunkel et al., 2008</a>), or from increased copy number of the relevant genes, via genome rearrangements such as whole chromosome and segmental aneuploidies (<a href=\"#bib72\">Selmecki et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">2009</a>). Indeed, the genomes of drug-resistant strains isolated following clinical treatment often exhibit large-scale changes, such as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Coste et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dunkel and Morschhauser, 2011</a>), copy-number variation (CNV), including short segmental CNV, and whole chromosome aneuploidy (<a href=\"#bib73\">Selmecki et al., 2010</a>) accompanied by point mutations."

It is challenging to use forward genetic approaches in <i>C. albicans</i> due to its diploid genome and lack of a complete sexual cycle. Although <i>C. albicans</i> has conserved the genomic elements needed for mating, mating occurs instead through rare mating-competent haploids (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hickman et al., 2013</a>) or via a parasexual cycle consisting of mating of diploid strains to form tetraploids followed by chromosome loss to regenerate diploids (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bennett and Johnson, 2005</a>). An alternative approach is to use isolates sampled consecutively from the same patient to study the changes in the frequency of variants in natural populations under selection for drug resistance. Studies in evolved isolates have implicated multiple mechanisms in drug resistance, but have focused on large-scale aberrations such as aneuploidies and LOH (<a href=\"#bib74\">Selmecki et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">2009</a>) or candidate genes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Perea et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">White et al., 2002</a>), and do not comprehensively chart the genetic basis of adaptation."

Most isolates from each individual patient were highly related, suggesting a clonal population structure and facilitating the identification of variation. Because each clinical sample was purified from a single colony, we cannot assess the population structure at any single time point. Instead, we have measured the occurrence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), CNV, and LOH events in each isolate and then compared them between isolates from the same patient and across patients' series. Consistent with previous studies, we found that LOH events were recurrent across patients' series and were associated with increased drug resistance. To identify SNPs with likely functional impact in the context of substantial genetic diversity, we focused on those events that were both persistent across isolates within a patient and were recurrent in the same gene across multiple patient series. We found 240 genes that recurrently contain persistent SNPs, many of which may be related not only to antifungal exposure but also to the complex process of adaptation to the host and antifungal exposure. In contrast, aneuploidies were prevalent in the isolates, yet they were more likely to be transient, and aneuploidy, per se, did not correlate with changes in drug resistance. Our work uses comparative analysis of a fungal pathogen to reveal new molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance and host adaptation and provides a general model for such studies in other eukaryotic pathogens."

Shown is a schematic illustration of the genomes of isolates (gray bars) from two patient time courses (Patient A and B, left and right panels, respectively), ordered from the first isolate (progenitor, top) to the last (evolved, bottom). Background mutations (purple) exist in the all isolates; persistent mutations (yellow) are not in the progenitor, but found in all subsequent isolates after their first occurrence; transient mutations (pink) are not in the progenitor and only in some later isolates; recurrently polymorphic genes contain persistent mutations that occur in the same gene in more than one patient (black box). LOH events were also evaluated for persistence (light teal bar). Driver mutations, where a new persistent homozygous allele appears (e.g., G/T &gt; A/A), are annotated in association with persistent LOH events (dark teal) and independent of these events (not shown). Each of these can be associated with a change in phenotype, such as drug resistance (boxes, right). (<b>B</b>) Sampling in the context of de novo mutation and selection bottlenecks. Each strain is a single clone (circle) isolated from an evolving population (represented by a phylogenetic tree). The population evolves and undergoes selective sweeps (dashed lines), with phenotypic changes occurring during the course of infection and treatment (i.e., drug resistance, black: high, white: low; gray scale at bottom). Persistent mutations (yellow lightning bolt) have likely swept through the population, whereas transient mutations (pink lightning bolt) have not. (<b>C</b>) Sampling in the context of selection on existing variation. Selection acts to vary the frequency of different pre-existing genotypes in the population. Persistent mutations (yellow lightning bolt) have risen in the population to a frequency that they are repeatedly sampled (large circles) whereas transient mutations (pink lightning bolt) have not (small circle)."

These data are consistent with two different evolutionary scenarios: accumulation of de novo mutations followed by selection (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), or selection acting on pre-existing variation to vary the frequency of different genotypes in the population (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The large number of SNPs detected suggests that isolates from later time points in a series are not simply direct descendants of the earlier isolate; however, since mutation and mitotic recombination rates can be elevated under stressful conditions (e.g., drug treatment <a href=\"#bib26\">Galhardo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Forche et al., 2011</a>), we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the variation may be due to de novo events occurring between time points. Formally distinguishing between these two models is not possible with the samples and data at hand. However, the role of pre-existing diversity is supported by the observation that different isolates collected on the same day from the same patient (patient 14 [2440 and 2501] and patient 16 [3107 and 3119]) differed by 9668 and 18,291 SNPs, respectively (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>) and had very different fluconazole MIC levels (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and different fitness phenotypes (see below), although in each case the strains were clearly genetically related (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus, we conclude that a population of related but divergent genotypes of the same lineage exists within a given patient. We next sought to identify potentially adaptive genetic changes by focusing on large-scale events (LOH and aneuploidies) as well as single-nucleotide polymorphisms."

Next, we defined alterations as <i>persistent</i> if present within the same patient at all subsequent time points after the \u2018non-progenitor\u2019 isolate in which they are first identified. We reasoned that such persistent changes will include those variants that were driven to sufficiently high frequency by selection to ensure repeated sampling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, yellow lightning bolt), whereas non-persistent (transient) ones do not (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, pink lightning bolt). We consider the special case of a genetic change detected only in the endpoint isolate as \u2018persistent\u2019 as well, since several of the time courses consist of only two or three isolates.

In the first strategy, to identify potential <i>drivers</i> of adaptation, we focused on non-synonymous SNPs that were homozygous for a genotype not found in the progenitor strain that persisted in the subsequent isolates (e.g., G/T &gt; A/A) consistent with positive selection. In the second strategy, we analyzed genes that were <i>recurrently</i> polymorphic across patients, such that persistent, non-synonymous polymorphisms appeared within the same open reading frame (ORF) in different patient series (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1A</a>). For recurrence, we considered only those that were not included in LOH regions, as these regions artificially inflate the estimates of persistence and recurrence. Recurrence allows us to better handle polymorphisms from the endpoint isolate in a series for which \u2018persistence\u2019 does not provide a meaningful filter. Thus, we further considered polymorphisms occurring only in the terminal isolate in one patient if polymorphisms also recurred in the same ORF in a series from two other patients. For example, filtering for both persistence and recurrence across at least three series reduced the number of polymorphisms for patient 1 from 13,562 polymorphisms in 5022 genes to 23 recurrent genes (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1A</a>)."

For example, three of four LOH events in Patient 1 were persistent and associated with an increase in MIC and both of these events were recurrent, such that LOH events in these genomic regions coincided with increases in MIC in other patients. Highly recurrent LOH events occurred on the right arm of chromosome 3 (in Patients 1, 9, 14, 16, 42, and 59; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B,D,F,H</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>) and on the left arm of chromosome 5 (in Patients 1, 14, 15, and 43; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C,G</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>).

Some of the SNPs were in genes that encode proteins with key known roles in drug resistance and were associated with large LOH events.

Several reasons may account for this difference. First, fluconazole, the antifungal drug used to treat the patients in our series, is fungistatic, such that many cells exposed to the drug arrest their growth but do not die. Thus, the range of diversity in the initial population is not entirely lost. In contrast, the <i>C. glabrata</i> study involved exposure to caspofungin, an echinocandin fungicidal drug. Therefore, most cells likely died upon drug exposure and only the rare survivors went on to seed the remaining population. Accordingly, the <i>C. glabrata</i> isolates may have been subjected to selection that would have removed much of the initial diversity in the population, whereas in the <i>C. albicans</i> series diversity persisted and selection acted mostly to change the relative proportions of different genotypes. Second, <i>C. albicans</i> is a highly heterozygous diploid whereas <i>C. glabrata</i> is haploid. Mutations can be more readily assimilated in a diploid than in a haploid organism, since deleterious mutations are potentially buffered by a functional version (<a href=\"#bib81\">Thompson et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, because <i>C. albicans</i> genomes are initially much more diverse (with tens of thousands of heterozygous SNPs in a given isolate), LOH is a high frequency mechanism available to reveal mutations more readily. Third, <i>C. albicans</i> lab isolates likely undergo a stress-induced elevation of mutation and mitotic recombination rates (<a href=\"#bib62\">Ponder et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Forche et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Rosenberg, 2011</a>), and exposure to a mammalian host results in elevated frequencies of LOH and aneuploidy (<a href=\"#bib23\">Forche et al. 2009</a>). Thus, it is possible that <i>C. albicans</i> isolates within the human host also undergo elevated levels of LOH and of point mutations to generate a wider range of diversity. Thus, <i>C. albicans</i> like <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gresham et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pavelka et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Yona et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chang et al., 2013</a>) generates large scale genetic variation as a means of adaptation. This adds another level of variation to the genome and protein diversity (<a href=\"#bib69\">Santos et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Selmecki et al., 2010</a>) that <i>C. albicans</i> is able to tolerate."

In the ten patients studied here, LOH was commonly observed and was associated with changes in MIC. As we detected LOH of mutations in <i>ERG11</i> in three patients, it would be of interest to know if the LOH in these known genes was sufficient to increase MIC, or if other genes within the homozygous region make important contributions."

Unlike LOH events, aneuploidies were often transient and not consistently correlated to increases in drug resistance. Perhaps these aneuploidies provide a mechanism akin to genetic assimilation (\u2018phenotype precedes genotype\u2019), in which cells are provided with a phenotypic mechanism that facilitates survival until a more stable and/or less costly mechanism is attained. In this case, the \u2018phenotypic\u2019 mechanism would be genetic but unstable\u2014the acquisition of one or more extra chromosomes. Nevertheless, aneuploidies may cause increased frequencies of LOH events through whole chromosome loss, as well as by increasing the likelihood of recombination events. A transient role for aneuploidy is consistent with recent findings from in vitro evolution studies in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib89\">Yona et al., 2012</a>) in which a transient aneuploidy was responsible for fitness at elevated temperature, but was eventually replaced by a more stable mutation."

The genes in several of these families (e.g., <i>ALS1</i>-<i>4</i>,<i>7</i>,<i>9</i> and <i>HYR</i>/<i>IFF</i> genes) frequently contain intragenic tandem repeats. Variation in intragenic repeat number modulates phenotypic diversity in adhesion and biofilm formation (<a href=\"#bib84\">Verstrepen et al., 2005</a>).

Indeed, several recent studies have shown a similar spectrum of genetic alterations to those observed here during the somatic evolution of cancers in patients undergoing chemotherapy (<a href=\"#bib61\">Podlaha et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Landau et al., 2013</a>) or treated with specific inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ding et al., 2012</a>) to those observed here."

It will be especially interesting to analyze the similarities and differences in additional <i>C. albicans</i> genome sequences that are likely to become available in the near future. Our results suggest there may be complex population dynamics during the transition from commensal to pathogen and across the course of treatment. As sequencing capacity continues to grow, it will be especially interesting to more fully sample this population-level diversity during longitudinal collection to better understand these dynamics. In particular, it will be interesting to determine the degree to which specific mutations recur in different isolates prior to and after the acquisition of drug resistance."

If two 500+ windows were within 7 KB of each, the region was assessed to determine if the event was actually one event and merged if the heterozygous sites in the inter-window space had homozygosed. If two isolates had LOHs that overlapped but did not have precisely identical boundaries, the LOH regions were combined such that the LOH interval for both isolates was the same.

This strain was chosen since it was a euploid strain with the highest MIC. There were two strains from patient 42 (3731 and 3733) with a higher MIC but these strains are aneuploid and thus the potential loss of additional chromosomes during the course of the competition could alter fitness and confound our results. The addition of the YFP marker reduced the fitness of the strain relative to the unaltered one and slightly reduced the fluconazole MIC as measured by the E-strip test. Fitness assays were performed as described above competition experiments except they were performed in RPMI and in RPMI with one half the MIC for fluconazole (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) initiated from replicate 1:1 mixtures of the same population of cells for each isolate tested."

Briefly, <i>Escherichia coli</i> OP50 and the different <i>C. albicans</i> clinical isolates were grown overnight respectively in LB at 37\u00b0C and YPD at 30\u00b0C. <i>E. coli</i> was then centrifuged and resuspended to a final concentration of 200 mg/ml, while <i>C. albicans</i> isolates were diluted with sterile water to OD<sub>600</sub> = 3. Small petri dishes (3.5 cm) containing NGM agar were spotted with a mixture of 10 \u03bcl streptomycin (stock solution 50 mg/ml), 2.5 \u03bcl of <i>E. coli</i>, 0.5 \u03bcl of <i>C. albicans</i>, and 7 \u03bcl of sterile water. The plates were incubated overnight at 25\u00b0C and 20 young synchronized N2 <i>C. elegans</i> adults were transferred on the spotted plates. Synchronous populations of adult worms were obtained by plating eggs on NGM plates seeded with <i>E. coli</i> OP50 at 20\u00b0C for 2\u20133 days. In this time frame, the eggs hatch and the larvae reach young adulthood. The survival assay was carried at 20\u00b0C, and worms were scored daily by gentle prodding with a platinum wire; dead worms were discarded while live ones were transferred to seeded plates grown overnight at 25\u00b0C. Worms accidentally killed while transferring or found dead on the edges of the plates were censored. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software; survival curves were obtained using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and p-values by using the log-rank test."

The reviewer raised the possibility of a sample switching. We first ruled out the possibility of a sample switch by repeating our genotyping from newly isolated DNA, but many of the discrepancies remained. We then examined the discordant calls and found that those were typically related with lower sequence coverage. Although our initial analysis used best practices at the time of original data collection, in some regions of lower sequencing coverage our GATK pipeline defaulted to the genotype of the provided reference genome, resulting in erroneous SNP calls when comparing between strains. Because our strains are also a resource used widely by the community, we decided to re-sequence all the strains to high coverage (53-283X, an average of 103X); this was not feasible when our data was initially collected, but major increases in sequencing yields made it readily possible now. The new sequencing data resolved the discrepancies, such that concordance between Sequenom iPlex and Illumina data reached 94% across all patients (see also the response to the issue 3 below; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1A</a> in blue).

This view is based on: (i) the very considerable genetic diversity (thousands of SNP differences) between isolates of the same strain within the same host, sampled less than a few months apart, in one case on the same day; (ii) the implausible mutation rate that would be needed to explain this variation as newly arising by mutation; and, (iii) the lack of analysis demonstrating that the data shows any signal of \u201cmeasurable evolution\u201d.</i>"

We have revised the text throughout the manuscript to clarify this point (especially in the Introduction and Results sections). Nevertheless, there is also ample evidence that mutation rates are increased under stressful conditions (e.g., drug treatment) in many systems, including yeasts, akin to what occurs in cancer (<a href=\"#bib26\">Galhardo et al., 2007</a>). Mitotic recombination events that give rise to LOH occur at a much higher rate (3 x 10<sup>-5</sup>) than single-nucleotide mutation rates and are also increased by stress. Specifically relevant here, LOH rates are elevated in <i>C. albicans</i> treated with fluconazole (<a href=\"#bib20\">Forche et al., 2011</a>). Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that some genetic changes, including LOH events, occurred de novo during the treatment and sampling window. We discuss this point in the revised manuscript, in the Discussion."

However, even if, as the reviewers suggest, <i>\u201call \u2018persistent mutations\u2019 are those pre-existing variants driven to sufficiently high frequency by selection to ensure repeated sampling, whereas transiently observed variants are not\u201d,</i> this scenario is still an evolutionary process, involving heritable variation and selection, and can still inform our functional understanding of host-pathogen interactions."

While the majority of our patient series represent only a few sequentially isolated clonal samples, Patient 1\u2019s series consists of 16 clonal, sequential isolates sampled over a period of nearly two years, and thus these samples can be analyzed for evidence of measurable evolution. We have used a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo approach (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees, BEAST; Drummond et al., 2012) to assess the rate of mutation in these populations and the likely time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA)."

Because there are no estimates of the per-basepair, per-generation mutation rate in <i>C. albicans</i>, we began with the assumption that <i>C. albicans</i> mutates at a rate similar to the per-base pair, per-generation rate of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (Lynch et al., 2008). We then adjusted this rate to a per-day rate based on the generation time observed for C<i>. albicans</i> in a mouse model (1.56 generations per day, <a href=\"#bib23\">Forche et al, 2009</a>), and determined the TMRCA for the isolates from Patient 1. Based on these assumptions, the TMRCA for these 16 isolates is \u223c 235 years (Author response image 2A). Indeed, using these parameters, many of the nodes separating two isolates are dated to be \u223c150 years in the past. While little is known of the genetic diversity present <i>in C. albicans</i> populations at the time of colonization, it seems unlikely that the most recent common ancestor for the clonal population seen in Patient 1 evolved 235 years prior to isolation: if colonization occurs primarily during birth, it would mean that much of the diversity present in this patient actually evolved in the patient\u2019s grandmother, or great grandmother."

To determine which of these three models best fit the data, we performed a pairwise calculation of Bayes factors (Author response image 2D), and we find that model (C), with an estimated substitution rate of 8.48 x 10<sup>-8</sup> best approximates our data. These results are consistent with the reviewer\u2019s comment that considerable variation developed before the onset of treatment and sampling; however, they also suggest that a substantial portion of the observed variation occurred during the treatment period in Patient 1. Importantly, they also suggest that an elevated mutation rate likely explains some of the diversity we observe, consistent with previous observations of in vivo hypermutability during infection and treatment (Oliver et al, Science 2000, <a href=\"#bib26\">Galhardo et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">Forche et al., 2011</a>)."
