Although the functional roles of the respective signaling pathways have been extensively studied, the control of insulin production and release is only partially understood. Herein, we show that in <i>Drosophila</i> expression of insulin-like peptides is regulated by neprilysin activity. Concomitant phenotypes of altered neprilysin expression included impaired food intake, reduced body size, and characteristic changes in the metabolite composition. Ectopic expression of a catalytically inactive mutant did not elicit any of the phenotypes, which confirms abnormal peptide hydrolysis as a causative factor. A screen for corresponding substrates of the neprilysin identified distinct peptides that regulate insulin-like peptide expression, feeding behavior, or both. The high functional conservation of neprilysins and their substrates renders the characterized principles applicable to numerous species, including higher eukaryotes and humans."

Although the functional roles of the respective signaling pathways have been extensively studied, the control of insulin production and release is only partially understood. Herein, we show that in <i>Drosophila</i> expression of insulin-like peptides is regulated by neprilysin activity. Concomitant phenotypes of altered neprilysin expression included impaired food intake, reduced body size, and characteristic changes in the metabolite composition. Ectopic expression of a catalytically inactive mutant did not elicit any of the phenotypes, which confirms abnormal peptide hydrolysis as a causative factor. A screen for corresponding substrates of the neprilysin identified distinct peptides that regulate insulin-like peptide expression, feeding behavior, or both. The high functional conservation of neprilysins and their substrates renders the characterized principles applicable to numerous species, including higher eukaryotes and humans."

Members of the neprilysin family generally consist of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a membrane spanning region, and a large extracellular domain with two highly conserved sequence motifs (HExxH; ExxA/GD) critical for zinc coordination, catalysis, and substrate or inhibitor binding (<a href=\"#bib27\">Matthews, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Oefner et al., 2000</a>). Because of these characteristics, neprilysins are classified as M13 zinc metallopeptidases. For human Neprilysin (NEP), the most well-characterized family member, identified substrates include endothelins, angiotensins I and II, enkephalins, bradykinin, atrial natriuretic peptide, substance P, and the amyloid-beta peptide (<a href=\"#bib52\">Turner et al., 2001</a>). Because of this high\u00a0substrate variability, NEP activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension (<a href=\"#bib31\">Molinaro et al., 2002</a>), analgesia (<a href=\"#bib57\">Whitworth, 2003</a>), cancer (<a href=\"#bib52\">Turner et al., 2001</a>), and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib22\">Iwata et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Belyaev et al., 2009</a>). Recent clinical trials have demonstrated significant efficacy of Neprilysin inhibitors in the treatment of certain indications (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jessup, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">McMurray et al., 2014</a>). However, despite the clinical relevance of the neprilysins, the physiological function and <i>in vivo</i> substrates of most family members are unknown."

With respect to Nep4, a critical function of the enzyme's non-catalytic intracellular N-terminus has been demonstrated: when present in excess, the domain induces severe muscle degeneration concomitant with lethality during late larval development. Because the intracellular domain interacts with a carbohydrate kinase, impaired energy metabolism has been proposed as the underlying cause of the phenotype (<a href=\"#bib35\">Panz et al., 2012</a>). In addition, Nep2 has been implicated in the regulation of locomotion and geotactic behavior (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bland et al., 2009</a>), and neprilysin activity in general appears to be critical to the formation of middle- and long-term memory (<a href=\"#bib53\">Turrel et al., 2016</a>), as well as to the regulation of pigment dispersing factor (PDF) signaling within circadian neural circuits (<a href=\"#bib21\">Isaac et al., 2007</a>). However, despite these experiments and recent findings that suggest a critical role of neprilysins in reproduction (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sitnik et al., 2014</a>), the physiological functionality of these enzymes is still far from being understood.

In the present study, we found that an increase in Nep4A in muscle cells (<i>mef2</i>-Gal4 driver) also induced biphasic lethality. An early phase occurred throughout embryonic and early larval development, and a late phase was evident by the end of larval development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Significantly, early lethality was observed only upon overexpression of the active enzyme; expression of catalytically inactive Nep4A, carrying a glutamine instead of an essential glutamate (E873Q) within the zinc-binding motif, did not affect viability at this point of development. By contrast, overexpression of catalytically active or inactive Nep4A constructs induced late larval lethality. These distinct effects demonstrate that lethality during early development is caused exclusively by a detrimental increase in catalytic activity, whereas late larval lethality appears to be a consequence of multiple physiological impairments. Comparable overexpression levels of the wild-type enzyme and the mutated construct were demonstrated previously (<a href=\"#bib35\">Panz et al., 2012</a>). Muscle-specific knockdown of <i>nep4</i> slightly increased embryonic mortality, but the majority of the respective animals died during metamorphosis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To confirm RNAi specificity, we also analyzed flies expressing both the respective RNAi construct as well as the Nep4A overexpression construct. Simultaneous overexpression of Nep4A completely rescued the RNAi phenotypes (embryonic/pupal lethality), thus confirming specificity of the knockdown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The result that respective animals exhibited a marginally, yet significantly increased lethality rate during third instar larval stage indicates that overexpression of Nep4A is somewhat more effective than knockdown, eventually resulting in slightly increased expression levels of the peptidase, which, as depicted above, result in elevated larval lethality."

                                "text": "To understand the physiological basis of this function in more detail, we analyzed the metabolite composition in animals with increased or reduced <i>nep4</i> levels and compared the respective compositions to those in control specimens. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, increasing or decreasing the expression of <i>nep4</i> in muscle tissue affected metabolite concentrations in transgenic third instar larvae. Of note, the depicted PCA scores plot is purely based on the amplitude of correlated between-sample variations, implicating that the strongest variations in metabolite composition are those separating the three genotypes. Further analysis of the respective data revealed that profound changes are related to the energy metabolism. Knockdown of <i>nep4</i> increased the levels of fructose and a purine and decreased the levels of NAD, a purine nucleotide, and glutamine\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Nep4A overexpression increased the signals of histidine, glutamine, and the same purine. In addition, a significant increase was observed in the spectral regions specific to glucose and fructose, indicating elevated levels of the two monosaccharides. Of note, only the glucose and fructose signals with contributions from both sugars (depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) were significantly affected, implying that there is a more stable response in the sum of the two than in either of them. However, evaluation of the corresponding individual spectra clearly suggested that both sugars are increased (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). On the other hand, lactate, NAD, trehalose, and tyrosine concentrations were reduced in Nep4A-overexpressing animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Of note, increased formation of lactate and NAD is a hallmark of aerobic glycolysis, a specific metabolic program that starts approximately 12 hr before the end of embryogenesis. Aerobic glycolysis enables hatched 1st instar larvae to efficiently convert dietary carbohydrates into biomass, thereby supporting the considerable increase in body mass that occurs during larval development (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tennessen et al., 2014</a>). Inhibition of aerobic glycolysis in the course of this growth phase prevents the animals from metabolizing sufficient quantities of sugar, resulting in larval lethality (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tennessen et al., 2011</a>). The fact that animals overexpressing Nep4A die primarily during the embryonic-larval transition and during larval development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and exhibit considerably reduced lactate and NAD levels indicates that an excess of Nep4A may interfere with this distinct metabolic program. OPLS-DA loading plots summarizing the respective NMR spectral changes are depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>."

We focused on <i>dilps 1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>3</i>, and <i>5</i> because they encode the major insulin-like peptides expressed by larval insulin-producing cells (IPCs) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rulifson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brogiolo et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cao and Brown, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ikeya et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">N\u00e4ssel et al., 2013</a>). IPCs are located within the median neurosecretory cell cluster of the central brain and apparently function like pancreatic \u03b2-cells, since IPC ablation in <i>Drosophila</i> results in elevated levels of circulating glucose. In addition, animals with ablated IPCs are smaller than wild-type specimens, and they weigh less (<a href=\"#bib10\">Broughton et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rulifson et al., 2002</a>). Significantly, these characteristic effects of IPC ablation were phenocopied by muscle-specific Nep4A overexpression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). Furthermore, the respective transgenic animals exhibited considerably reduced expression of the selected <i>dilps</i>. In Nep4A-overexpressing animals, <i>dilp1</i> expression decreased by 59%, <i>dilp2</i> by 83%, <i>dilp3</i> expression by 88%, and <i>dilp5</i> expression by 84%, relative to expression in controls. On the other hand, muscle-specific <i>nep4</i> knockdown had no effect on the expression of <i>dilps 1, 3,</i> and <i>5</i>, although expression of <i>dilp2</i> increased by 82%, relative to expression in controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The rather mild effect of <i>nep4</i> knockdown on <i>dilp</i> expression, when compared to the effects of Nep4A overexpression, suggests that other, yet unknown peptidases can compensate for reduced Nep4 activity. In line with the results from the feeding assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), <i>dilp</i> expression is only affected by the wild type enzyme, while overexpression of catalytically inactive Nep4A did not significantly alter expression of the selected <i>dilps</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

Although these effects were minor compared to the effects of modulating the expression of muscle-bound Nep4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), they demonstrate that proper regulation of <i>dilp</i> expression also requires adequate Nep4 levels within the CNS."

As depicted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, in body wall muscles Nep4 exhibits a dual localization: in addition to localizing to membranes continuous with the nuclear membrane (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, arrowheads), which we previously identified as related to the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (<a href=\"#bib35\">Panz et al., 2012</a>), the peptidase accumulates at the surface of the muscles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, arrows). The latter localization is consistent with ectoenzymatic activity and indicative of a function in regulating the homeostasis of hemolymph circulating peptides. To confirm the specificity of the signal, we also stained the muscles of transgenic animals expressing <i>nep4</i>-specific RNAi (<i>mef2</i>-Gal4 driver). In these transgenic animals, no signal above background was observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In addition, staining wild-type muscles with secondary antibodies alone did not result in a distinct signal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Of note, the proteins expressed from the two overexpression constructs (wild-type Nep4A and catalytically inactive Nep4A) exhibited subcellular localizations identical to that of the endogenous protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,D,F</a>), confirming that the observed overexpression phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>) were not impaired by mislocalization of the respective constructs. In order to distinguish the ectopic proteins from the endogenous protein, the ectopic constructs were fused to a C-terminal HA-tag and labeled with corresponding antibodies. Antibody specificity was confirmed by the lack of staining in animals expressing only the Gal4 transgene but not the UAS-construct (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,G</a>)."

This indication is corroborated by the localization of Nep4 to the surface of body wall muscles and IPCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>), with the latter constituting the major site of Dilp synthesis in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rulifson et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brogiolo et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ikeya et al., 2002</a>).

The only additional prerequisite for consideration as a potential substrate was a size of less than 5 kDa, which for steric reasons represents the maximum mass of a neprilysin substrate (<a href=\"#bib34\">Oefner et al., 2000</a>). As depicted in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, we found 23 peptides matching these criteria. Among these candidates, 16 were hydrolyzed at distinct positions by purified Nep4, while the remaining seven peptides were not significantly cleaved.

                        "text": "While the functional roles of insulin-like peptides (ILPs) and the corresponding insulin- and IGF-signaling have been intensively studied, the control of ILP production and release is not well understood. This study demonstrates that modulating the expression of a <i>Drosophila</i> neprilysin interferes with the expression of insulin-like peptides, thus establishing a correlation between neprilysin activity and the regulation of insulin signaling. A high physiological relevance is confirmed by the fact that altering <i>nep4</i> expression phenocopies characteristic effects of IPC ablation, including reduced size and weight of corresponding animals, as well as increased levels of carbohydrates such as glucose and fructose (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). The result that the levels of these sugars are increased, although food intake rates are reduced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) presumably reflects the physiological impact of the diminished <i>ilp</i> expression that is also obvious in corresponding animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In this respect, the impaired insulin signaling likely results in inefficient metabolization and thus accumulation of the sugars, which overcompensates the diametrical effects of reduced food intake. By identifying 16 novel peptide substrates of Nep4, the majority of which are involved in regulating <i>dilp</i> expression or feeding behavior (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), and by localizing the peptidase to the surface of body wall muscles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and IPCs within the larval CNS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), we provide initial evidence that neprilysin-mediated hydrolysis of hemolymph circulating as well as CNS intrinsic peptides is the physiological basis of the described phenotypes. The finding that only the catalytically active enzyme affected <i>dilp</i> expression whereas the inactive construct did not (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), substantiates this evidence because it confirms aberrant enzymatic activity and thus abnormal peptide hydrolysis as a causative parameter. Interestingly, we observed the strongest effects on size and <i>dilp</i> expression with muscle-specific overexpression of Nep4; overexpression of the peptidase in the CNS was less detrimental (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results indicate that hemolymph circulating peptides accessible to muscle-bound Nep4 are mainly responsible for the observed effects, while CNS intrinsic peptide signaling is less relevant. The fact that all peptides cleaved by Nep4 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) could be released into the hemolymph, either from enteroendocrine cells or from neurohormonal release sites (<a href=\"#bib33\">N\u00e4ssel and Winther, 2010</a>), substantiates this indication. Since the <i>Drosophila</i> midgut is the source of several neuropeptides (<a href=\"#bib54\">Veenstra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Reiher et al., 2011</a>), it is conceivable that a main reason for the observed phenotypes is aberrant cleavage of certain gut-derived peptides that are required for proper midgut-IPC communication. Allatostatin A, neuropeptide F, diuretic hormone 31, and some tachykinins are produced by endocrine cells of the gut (<a href=\"#bib54\">Veenstra et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Reiher et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lenz et al., 2001</a>). Interestingly, all have been implicated in regulating <i>dilp</i> expression and/or feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib32\">N\u00e4ssel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pool and Scott, 2014</a>), and most of them, namely allatostatin A1-4, diuretic hormone 31, and tachykinin 1, 2, 4, and 5, were cleaved by Nep4 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), indicating enzyme-substrate relationships. Thus, these results suggest that Nep4 activity at the surface of muscle cells is necessary to maintain homeostasis of distinct hemolymph circulating signaling peptides, probably gut-derived, thereby ensuring proper midgut-IPC communication. On the other hand, fat body-IPC feedback may be affected as well. However, the only factors known to mediate this process, Unpaired 2 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</a>), DILP6 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bai et al., 2012</a>), and Stunted (<a href=\"#bib16\">Delanoue et al., 2016</a>\ufeff) have molecular masses of more than 5 kDa, and thus exceed the maximum mass of a putative neprilysin substrate (<a href=\"#bib34\">Oefner et al., 2000</a>). Consequently, a direct regulatory influence of Nep4 on Unpaired 2, DILP6,\u00a0or\u00a0Stunted activity appears unlikely."

This result suggests that CNS intrinsic Nep4 activity affects different neuropeptide regulatory systems than the corresponding muscle-bound activity. Considering the rather broad expression in glial cells, it is furthermore likely that the CNS regulation affects more than one system. However, localization at the IPC surface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) clearly supports a direct function in the regulation of <i>dilp</i> expression. In this context, spatial proximity of the peptidase may be necessary to ensure low ligand concentrations and thus tight regulation of specific neuropeptide receptors present at the surface of IPCs. Such receptors include an allatostatin A receptor (Dar-2) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hentze et al., 2015</a>), a tachykinin receptor (DTKR) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Birse et al., 2011</a>), and the short neuropeptide F receptor (sNPFR) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2008</a>). All are essential to proper <i>dilp</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hentze et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Birse et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, with respect to sNPFR, corresponding ligands (sNPF1<sub>1\u201311</sub>, sNPF1<sub>4\u201311</sub>, and sNPF2<sub>12\u201319</sub>) exhibit very high-binding affinities, with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the low nanomolar range (<a href=\"#bib17\">Garczynski et al., 2006</a>), a finding that further emphasizes the need for effective ligand clearance mechanisms in order to prevent inadvertent receptor activation. Localization of Nep4 to the surface of IPCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and confirmation of Dar-2, DTKR, and sNPFR ligands as substrates of the peptidase (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) strongly indicate that Nep4 participates in such clearance mechanisms."

The dual localization is interesting because both compartments are accessible to Nep4, either to the CNS resident or to the muscle-bound enzyme. Significantly, sNPF is a potent regulator of <i>dilp</i> expression. Increased sNPF levels result in upregulation of <i>dilp</i> expression, and decreased sNPF levels have the opposite effect (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2008</a>). The fact that these results inversely correlate with the effects of modulating <i>nep4</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) suggests a functional relationship between sNPF and the neprilysin. Nep4-mediated cleavage of distinct sNPF species (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) represents further evidence for this relationship."

This regulatory activity on peptides with opposing physiological functions indicates that Nep4 affects multiple aspects of feeding control, rather than promoting or inhibiting food intake in a mutually exclusive manner. Our finding that both, <i>nep4</i> knockdown and overexpression larvae exhibit reduced food intake (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) supports this indication since it suggests that regular Nep4 activity adjusts the general peptide homeostasis in a manner that promotes optimal food intake, with deviations in either direction being deteriorative. The result that <i>nep4</i> knockdown animals exhibit reduced food intake for only up to 20 min of feeding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) may reflect this complex regulation since it indicates that at the onset of feeding reduced cleavage of peptides inhibiting food intake (e.g. allatostatin A, drosulfakinins) is a dominant factor. With ongoing feeding, accumulation of peptides promoting food intake (e.g. corazonin) may become decisive, thus restoring intake rates."

This finding indicates that the Nep4-mediated regulation of <i>dilp</i> expression and sugar homeostasis can also not be attributed to a single substrate or cleavage event. Rather, it is a result of the concerted hydrolysis of several critical peptides, including both, hemolymph circulating and CNS intrinsic factors. Taking into account that overexpression and knockdown of <i>nep4</i> have discrete effects on <i>dilp</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), but comparable effects on feeding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), it furthermore appears likely that dysregulation of the Nep4-mediated peptide homeostasis affects both processes somewhat independently of each other.

Interestingly, a critical function of murine Neprilysin in determining body mass has already been reported. The regulation depended primarily on the catalytic activity of peripheral NEP, while the CNS-bound enzyme was less important (<a href=\"#bib3\">Becker et al., 2010</a>). However, until now, the underlying physiology has been obscure, essentially because no causative hydrolysis event had been identified. Our finding that also in <i>Drosophila</i> mainly peripheral (muscle-bound) Nep4 activity affected body mass, while CNS-specific modulations had only minor effects on size or weight (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), indicates that the neprilysin-mediated regulation of food intake, body size and insulin expression involves similar physiological pathways in both species. Furthermore, the fact that altered catalytic activity and thus abnormal peptide hydrolysis is a critical factor in mice (<a href=\"#bib3\">Becker et al., 2010</a>) and in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>) emphasizes the need to generate comprehensive, enzyme-specific lists of neprilysin <i>in vivo</i> substrates.

The trap column was switched inline with a separation column (Acclaim PepMap C18 2 \u00b5m, 0.075\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150 mm, Thermo Scientific). Subsequently, bound substances were eluted by changing the mixture of buffer A (99% water, 1% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 20% water and 0.1% formic acid) from 100:0 to 20:80 within 45 min. The flow rate was kept constant at 0.3 \u00b5l/min. Successively eluted compounds were analyzed with an ESI-ion trap (Amazon ETD Speed with a captive spray ionization unit, Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) by measuring the masses of the intact molecules as well as the masses of the fragments, which were generated by collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the corresponding parent ion."

Finally, samples were washed as described above and mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, USA). For staining of body wall muscles, male third instar larvae were dissected on Sylgard plates (Sylgard 184 Elastomer Base and Curing Agent, Dow Corning, Michigan, USA), fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 1 hr, rinsed three times in PBS, and transferred into 1.5 ml reaction cups. Subsequently, tissues were permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 for 1 hr, blocked in Roti-Block (45 min), and incubated with primary antibodies (overnight).

Confocal images were captured with an LSM5 Pascal confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To exclude a possible bleed-through of the signals, sequential channel acquisition was performed starting with Cy3 channel by using single excitation at 543 nm and a long pass emission filter LP560, followed by Cy2 channel acquisition with single excitation at 488 nm and a single bandpass filter BP 505\u2013530 nm. There was no bleed-through of the Cy2 signal to the Cy3 channel because Cy2 is not excited by the 543 nm laser line. Using a narrow bandpass filter between 505\u00a0nm\u00a0and\u00a0530 nm guaranteed that cross talk of Cy3 excitation by the 488 laser line is not detected during Cy2 channel acquisition. Z-stacks are displayed as maximum projections if not stated otherwise."

They show that overexpression and knock down of Nep4 in muscle tissue cause stage specific lethality and size/mass difference in the 3rd instar larvae. Manipulation of Nep4 also potently impacts development and the metabolome. The authors also assessed the endogenous expression of Nep4 in larval tissue and find that Nep4 is expressed in the muscle as well as in the central nervous system, including in the neuroendocrine cells that produce insulin like peptides. Given the role of neprilysins in regulation of neuropeptide signaling and the novelty of these phenotypes, these findings are interesting and could be of interest to a broad audience. However, currently the data presented is somewhat preliminary and several issues need to be addressed. In particular, the authors need to clarify how Nep4 is regulating metabolism, through muscle or through other cell types including neurons."
