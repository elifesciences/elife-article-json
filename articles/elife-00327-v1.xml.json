The HIV-1 Tat protein selectively recruits P-TEFb as part of a super elongation complex (SEC) organized on a flexible AFF1 or AFF4 scaffold. To understand this specificity and determine if scaffold binding alters P-TEFb conformation, we determined the structure of a tripartite complex containing the recognition regions of P-TEFb and AFF4. AFF4 meanders over the surface of the P-TEFb cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunit but makes no stable contacts with the CDK9 kinase subunit. Interface mutations reduced CycT1 binding and AFF4-dependent transcription. AFF4 is positioned to make unexpected direct contacts with HIV Tat, and Tat enhances P-TEFb affinity for AFF4. These studies define the mechanism of scaffold recognition by P-TEFb and reveal an unanticipated intersubunit pocket on the AFF4 SEC that potentially represents a target for therapeutic intervention against HIV/AIDS."

The HIV-1 Tat protein selectively recruits P-TEFb as part of a super elongation complex (SEC) organized on a flexible AFF1 or AFF4 scaffold. To understand this specificity and determine if scaffold binding alters P-TEFb conformation, we determined the structure of a tripartite complex containing the recognition regions of P-TEFb and AFF4. AFF4 meanders over the surface of the P-TEFb cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunit but makes no stable contacts with the CDK9 kinase subunit. Interface mutations reduced CycT1 binding and AFF4-dependent transcription. AFF4 is positioned to make unexpected direct contacts with HIV Tat, and Tat enhances P-TEFb affinity for AFF4. These studies define the mechanism of scaffold recognition by P-TEFb and reveal an unanticipated intersubunit pocket on the AFF4 SEC that potentially represents a target for therapeutic intervention against HIV/AIDS."

P-TEFb and other elongation factors therefore have an important role in gene expression."

To do this, the virus produces a protein called Tat that recruits P-TEFb as part of a multi-protein machine called the super elongation complex. This ensures that the process of transcriptional elongation, and hence the overall replication process, is highly efficient. There are gaps, however, in our knowledge of the architecture of the super elongation complex, which is known to be organized on a flexible scaffold. In turn, the molecular basis for the interaction between HIV-1 Tat and P-TEFb within the super elongation complex is not well understood."

In addition to assisting with the expression of hundreds of human genes, super elongation complexes containing P-TEFb-AFF4 are hijacked in various forms of cancer and viral infections, including HIV/AIDS. Schulze-Gahmen et al. show that AFF4 can directly contact HIV-1 Tat, which binds to the P-TEFb-AFF4 complex much more strongly than it binds to P-TEFb alone. This suggests that HIV-1 Tat evolved to work within the super elongation complex. Moreover, Schulze-Gahmen et al. reveal that HIV-1 Tat binds to a cleft between the P-TEFb enzyme and the AFF4 protein, which raises the possibility that this cleft could be used as a target for anti-HIV/AIDS drugs."

These paused polymerases are poised for rapid, synchronous efficient transcription. For these genes, escape of the paused polymerase from the promoter-proximal region and elongation of the mRNA are rate-limiting regulated processes. Promoter escape requires positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), a heterodimeric protein kinase composed of CDK9 and cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunits. P-TEFb triggers promoter escape by directly or indirectly stimulating phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain and the associated factors, NELF (negative elongation factor) and DSIF (DRB sensitivity inducing factor). Consequently, recruitment of active P-TEFb to the paused polymerase complex serves as an important checkpoint for gene expression (<a href=\"#bib14\">Levine, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Luo et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>)."

The SECs act at many normal human genes to stimulate mRNA elongation not only by triggering promoter escape but also by limiting proteolytic degradation of transcription elongation factors and increasing the processivity of RNAP II (<a href=\"#bib9\">He et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Lin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Biswas et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). The SECs also couple to the PAF complex, which stimulates efficient transcript elongation (<a href=\"#bib8\">He et al., 2011</a>). In addition to P-TEFb, the SECs contain subunits in the AF4, ELL, and ENL/AF9 protein families. Despite the major roles of SECs in metazoan gene expression and human disease, little is known about the architecture of these complexes."

Here, we report the structural and functional analysis of P-TEFb in complex with the cognate binding site on the SEC scaffold protein, AFF4. These studies reveal that AFF4 recognizes P-TEFb by binding the CycT1 subunit on the side opposite from CDK9. AFF4 is positioned to make direct contacts with HIV-1 Tat. Tat increases the affinity of P-TEFb for AFF4 by over an order of magnitude in vitro and rescues P-TEFb binding of AFF4 interface mutants in vivo. These results suggest that the SEC scaffold is an unanticipated direct partner of HIV-1 Tat, and an intersubunit Tat-binding pocket in the AFF4-P-TEFb complex may afford an unexpected site to target with selective inhibitors of HIV transcription."

We focus on the shared features of the three independent complexes. Consistent with the coupling of folding to binding, AFF4 lacks intramolecular tertiary contacts as it snakes across the CycT1 surface. An extended segment in AFF4 tracks antiparallel to the H3\u2032-H4\u2032 loop in CycT1, and two short AFF4 helices fit into shallow grooves in CycT1 between H3\u2032 and H5\u2032 and the surface formed by H2\u2032 and H3\u2032 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

Consistent with the structure, mutations of AFF4 residues that contact P-TEFb reduced Tat-independent transcriptional stimulation. Three of the most deleterious variations\u2014alanine substitutions at Pro33/Leu34, Phe35 (Ala36 was maintained), and Met55/Leu56\u2014shorten hydrophobic side chains that are buried in the interface. Tandem alanine substitutions (Glu45/Asp46 and Gly57/Asn58) that remove side chains that cap and stabilize the AFF4 helices also reduced luciferase expression. In contrast, residues such as Glu61/Met62 and Ile71/Pro72, which are more tolerant of di-alanine substitutions, are more solvent exposed or flexible. Tandem alanine replacements in residues 3\u201332, which flank the ordered CycT1 contacts in the crystal structure, showed significant but generally smaller effects on AFF4 transcriptional stimulation activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

The discovery that Tat recruits P-TEFb as part of a larger SEC (<a href=\"#bib9\">He et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Sobhian et al., 2010</a>) raised the question of how Tat distinguishes the SEC from free P-TEFb, particularly since Tat binds P-TEFb in isolation. Moreover, Tat shows specificity for SECs containing AFF4 and AFF1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">He et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Sobhian et al., 2010</a>). What accounts for this specificity? The AFF4-P-TEFb crystal structure provides a simple and unsuspected explanation\u2014Tat binds in a position to make direct contacts with the scaffold (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Superposition of the CycT1 subunits of the structures of Tat-P-TEFb (<a href=\"#bib24\">Tahirov et al., 2010</a>) and AFF4-P-TEFb shows that Tat is positioned to pack against helix 2 of AFF4. Tat Met1, Lys28 (which is reversibly acetylated in vivo; <a href=\"#bib11\">Kiernan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ott et al., 2011</a>) and Phe32, in particular, are predicted to interact with AFF4 Glu61, Met62, Phe65, and Ile66. The disordered C-terminus of the AFF4 peptide also neighbors Glu2 and His13-Gly15 of Tat. These seven residues of Tat are crucial for transcriptional activation, even though they are exposed to solvent in the Tat-P-TEFb complex (<a href=\"#bib31\">D'Orso et al., 2012</a>)."

Direct measurements of Tat affinity are problematic, however, because Tat is unstable in vitro in the absence of partners and difficult to maintain in an active form. To overcome this problem, we took advantage of a thermodynamic cycle that illustrates that AFF4 and Tat mutually influence the P-TEFb affinity of each other by the same amount (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In quantitative in vitro assays (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), the purified AFF4<sub>2\u201373</sub> peptide bound Tat-P-TEFb (K<sub>d</sub> = 0.85 \u00b1 0.15 nM) \u223c11 times more tightly than P-TEFb (K<sub>d</sub> = 10 \u00b1 1 nM).

These defects were rescued by overexpressing a stably integrated gene for Tat, which strengthened the AFF4-P-TEFb association. In contrast, tandem alanine substitutions for AFF4 Glu61/Met62, which are more exposed in the P-TEFb interface and predicted to contact Tat, caused a small reduction (\u223c30%) in the binding of P-TEFb that was not rescued by overexpressing Tat (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

These contacts are largely conserved in AF4 family members and can be perturbed physically and functionally by mutations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Consistent with these results, tandem alanine substitutions of Pro33/Leu34, Val41/Thr42, Arg51/Ile52, and Met55/Leu56 in the CycT1 binding site (but not Arg3/Glu4 or Glu25/Asp26 in the preceding segment) also reduce P-TEFb binding in vivo (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chou et al., 2012</a>). The impacts of alanine substitutions on transcriptional stimulation by AFF4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) show that residues in the P-TEFb interface, as well as helix stabilizing residues, play crucial roles. The additional sensitivity of transcriptional stimulation to alanine substitutions of disordered residues flanking the CycT1 binding site suggests that the flexibility and potential interactions with other ligands are important for function."

The AFF4 Glu61/Met62 double alanine substitution in the proposed Tat interface blocks this rescue. These results suggest that direct contacts between Tat and the AFF4 scaffold in complex with P-TEFb mediate the selective recruitment of the SEC to the HIV promoter. The functional AFF4-Tat interface, including the acetylated Lys28 in Tat as a potential regulator of affinity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kiernan et al., 1999</a>), supports the idea that Tat evolved to function within the SEC. In the crystal structure of the (low-affinity) Tat-P-TEFb subcomplex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Tahirov et al., 2010</a>), Tat binds to a relatively open groove. In the context of the AFF4-P-TEFb structure, however, AFF4 creates an unanticipated pocket for Tat (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This pocket may ultimately provide a suitable therapeutic target for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of Tat binding that selectively block HIV transcription."

The beads were eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl pH 3.5, and the neutralized eluate was analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies."

For assays with 0.05 mM ATP, 0.15 \u03bcCi [<sup>32</sup>P]-\u03b3-ATP was used, and for reactions with 0.5 mM ATP, 1.5 \u03bcCi [<sup>32</sup>P]-\u03b3-ATP was used. Reactions in conventional tubes gave distinct less reproducible results. Purified recombinant P-TEFb or P-TEFb-Tat was pre-incubated with 500 ng purified recombinant GST-CTD (52 C-terminal domain repeats from human RNA polymerase) in the absence or presence of 0.3 \u00b5M purified AFF4<sub>2\u201373</sub> for 15 min at 20\u00b0C. After addition of ATP, the kinase reactions were stopped at different times by addition of 5 \u03bcl of 5\u00d7 SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by measurement of the radioactive protein bands on a Typhoon phosphorimager (GE Healthcare)."

The structure is at relatively low resolution (2.9 \u00c5), but the crystallography appears technically strong and the overall similarity of the three complexes in the asymmetric unit also lends confidence. The structure reveals how P-TEFb binds the aff4 scaffold, and the observed Cyclin T1-AFF4 interactions are strongly supported by extensive binding studies using mutant Cyclin T1 proteins and transcription activation data using mutant aff4 proteins. A very interesting point is that the bound aff4 peptide approaches the Tat binding site, suggesting that aff4 may contact Tat directly. This hypothesis is nicely supported by the demonstration that aff4 binds 11-fold more tightly to the P-TEFb:Tat complex than to P-TEFb alone. Supporting IP data also show that Tat expression can \u201crescue\u201d the effects of aff4 mutations that would otherwise inhibit Cyclin T1 binding, although these studies do not unambiguously identify aff4 residues that contact Tat (Glu61/Met62 are presented as attractive candidates, but the binding/rescue effects are small). The discovery that Tat probably contacts aff4 directly is significant, and adds aff4 as an important component to the previously characterized pTEFb/Tat/TAR complex."

This contact is only seen in one of the complexes in the asymmetric unit, but multiple binding experiments suggest that interactions the N-terminal region of aff4 and the CDK9 subunit probably increase the affinity of the AFF4:P-TEFb complex by about four-fold (e.g., the data in Table 2), and mutations in this region of aff4 can have significant (albeit not overwhelming) effects on transcriptional activation (Figure 3B). Testing one or two structure-based aff4 point mutants would address whether or not this (admittedly weak) contact actually occurs in solution. Both types of requested aff4 mutants could be analyzed in the FP competition experiments (as reported for other aff4 constructs in Table 2)."

Moreover, K28 of Tat, which is engaged in the aff4 interaction in our model but exposed to solvent in the Tat-P-TEFb complex, is acetylated in vivo and this modification regulates Tat functions."
