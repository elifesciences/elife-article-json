This association, referred to as a holoenzyme, tethers the pol to DNA, substantially increasing the extent of continuous replication (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hedglin et al., 2013a</a>). However, the stringent replicative pols cannot accommodate distortions to the native DNA sequence such as such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), the major DNA lesions resulting from ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Upon encountering these lesions, DNA synthesis on the afflicted template abruptly stops but the replication fork progresses onward, exposing the damaged template. Fork progression eventually stalls and replication protein A (RPA) coats the exposed ssDNA, protecting it from cellular nucleases (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hedglin and Benkovic, 2015</a>)."

With a more open pol active site and the lack of proofreading activity, TLS pols are able to support stable, yet potentially erroneous, nucleotide incorporation opposite damaged templates allowing DNA synthesis by the replicative pol to resume (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lange et al., 2011</a>). In humans, TLS involves the conjugation of single ubiquitin moieties (that\u00a0is monoubiquitination) to PCNA clamps encircling blocked primer/template (P/T) junctions and at least seven TLS pols with varying fidelities. However, remarkably low error rates are observed in vivo\u00a0after exposure to various DNA-damaging agents, indicating a highly efficient process (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hedglin and Benkovic, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lange et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yoon et al., 2012</a>).

The signal for this post-translational modification (PTM) is the buildup and persistence of RPA-coated ssDNA during S-phase. Such structures recruit the Rad6/Rad18 complex to the exposed DNA template where it catalyzes monoubiquitination of lysine residue(s) K164 of the PCNA ring encircling the blocked P/T junction upstream. Hence, this PTM is a generic response that may be elicited by any agent that uncouples DNA synthesis by the replicative pols from replication fork progression, even those that do not modify the DNA at all (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hedglin and Benkovic, 2015</a>). Most studies on the role of monoubiquitinated PCNA during TLS have focused on members of the Y-family of TLS pols, pol \u03b7 in particular. In human cells, pol \u03b7 is responsible for the error-free replication of CPDs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yoon et al., 2009</a>). The magnitude of this feat is underscored by xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV), a human autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which the <i>xpv</i> gene encoding pol\u03b7 is either mutated or deleted, leading to extreme UV sensitivity and skin cancer predisposition (<a href=\"#bib28\">Masutani et al., 1999</a>). Following UV irradiation, PCNA encircling damaged DNA is monoubiquitinated during S-phase and pol \u03b7 co-localizes with PCNA in replication factories (foci) on damaged DNA. Both activities are imperative for TLS following UV irradiation. All Y-family pols contain one or more PCNA-binding domains and at least one ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sale et al., 2012</a>). The seminal in vivo studies suggested the widely-accepted \u2018recruitment/displacement\u2019 model that the ubiquitin moieties attached to PCNA serve to directly recruit pol \u03b7 (via its UBD) to sites of DNA damage where it may also displace a blocked replicative pol (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bienko et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kannouche et al., 2004</a>). However, one cannot extrapolate these findings to conclude unequivocally that a direct interaction between pol \u03b7 and a ubiquitin conjugated to PCNA is required or even occurs during human TLS (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sabbioneda et al., 2009</a>). In fact, the collective in vivo\u00a0evidence suggests otherwise. Firstly, pol \u03b7 co-localizes with PCNA in replication foci during unperturbed S-phase in human cells and this activity requires the UBD of pol \u03b7 even though PCNA monoubiquitination is absent (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bienko et al., 2005</a>). Secondly, pol \u03b7 accumulates into replication foci after UV irradiation independently of PCNA monoubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib13\">G\u00f6hler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sabbioneda et al., 2008</a>) and does not require the UBD of pol \u03b7 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Despras et al., 2012</a>). Rather, monoubiquitinated PCNA and the UBD of pol \u03b7 independently retain pol \u03b7 within replication foci, increasing the residence time of localized pol \u03b7. Other reports arrived at the same conclusion but challenged the requirement of the UBD of pol \u03b7 for TLS following UV irradiation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acharya et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">2010</a>). Thirdly, in vivo\u00a0studies on various eukaryotes irradiated with UV suggest that the requirement for PCNA monoubiquitination depends on the location of TLS relative to the replication fork; TLS at/near a stalled replication fork is independent of PCNA monoubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib11\">Edmunds et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Temviriyanukul et al., 2012</a>) while TLS behind a re-started and progressing replication fork requires PCNA monoubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib6\">Daigaku et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Karras and Jentsch, 2010</a>). How then does polymerase switching and TLS occur and what is the role of PCNA monoubiquitination in this process?"

In this report, we performed extensive quantitative studies on human pols \u03b4 and \u03b7 to delineate TLS on the lagging strand. The results clearly demonstrate that the binding of pol \u03b7 to PCNA and DNA synthesis by a pol \u03b7 holoenzyme are both independent of PCNA monoubiquitination, refuting the recruitment/displacement model for human TLS. Furthermore, these studies reveal that the unique properties of pols \u03b7 and \u03b4 are attuned to promote a passive and efficient exchange of pols that is independent of PCNA monoubiquitination. Altogether, these studies reveal a novel mechanism for human TLS and direct future studies on the role of PCNA monoubiquitination."

We utilized FRET to characterize the interaction between pol \u03b7 and PCNA. FRET between Cy3-pol \u03b7 and Cy5-PCNA is only observed in the presence of both proteins (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and this signal was utilized to determine the affinity of the pol \u03b7\u2022PCNA interaction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, left panel).

To directly compare the binding affinities of pol \u03b7 for PCNA and monoubiquitinated PCNA, we carried out a FRET-based competition experiment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right panel) by titrating a pre-assembled Cy3-Pol \u03b7\u2022Cy5-PCNA complex with an unlabeled PCNA competitor. As observed in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, the fraction of Cy3-Pol \u03b7\u2022Cy5-PCNA complex decreased with PCNA concentration, indicating that PCNA competes with Cy5-PCNA for binding to Cy3-Pol \u03b7 (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0308\u00a0\u00b1 19.8 nM). A <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> of 111\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.78 nM is calculated from the IC<sub>50</sub> for PCNA.

These <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> values are identical and both in excellent agreement with the <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> for the Cy5-PCNA\u2022Cy3-Pol \u03b7 interaction (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Together, this validates the experimental approach. Monoubiquitinated PCNA (referred to herein as (Ub)<sub>3</sub>-PCNA) contains a single ubiquitin moiety on K164 of each monomer within a homotrimeric clamp ring (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). When (Ub)<sub>3</sub>-PCNA was utilized as the unlabeled competitor, a <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> of 119\u00a0\u00b1 10.5 nM was obtained, in excellent agreement with the <i>K<sub>i</sub></i> measured for PCNA (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

Pol \u03b7 was N-terminally labeled with Cy3 (Cy3-Pol \u03b7). Compared to the unlabeled protein, Cy3-Pol \u03b7 bound to PCNA with similar affinity (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and retained more than 80% of the DNA synthesis activity (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), demonstrating that Cy3 does not compromise pol \u03b7 activities. Human PCNA was site-specifically labeled with Cy5 (Cy5-PCNA) at amino acid residue 107, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hedglin et al., 2013b</a>). This amino acid residue is located on the \u2018back\u2019 face of the PCNA homotrimer, opposite that which interacts with pol \u03b7. Interaction between the Cy3-pol \u03b7 and the Cy5-PCNA was assessed by exciting the Cy3-Pol \u03b7 with a 514 nm light source and monitoring the fluorescence emission intensities at 570 nm (Cy3 donor fluorescence emission max, I<sub>570</sub>) and 670 nm (Cy5 acceptor fluorescence emission max, I<sub>670</sub>). Cy5-PCNA can be excited through FRET from Cy3-Pol \u03b7 only when the two dyes are in close proximity (&lt;\u223c10 nm). This is indicated by an increase in I<sub>670</sub> (<b>B</b>) Fluorescence emission spectra (540\u2013750 nm) recorded after exciting with a 514 nm light source. The intensities at 670 nm (I<sub>670</sub>) and 570 nm (I<sub>570</sub>) are indicated. In the presence of both proteins (200 nM Cy3-pol \u03b7, 20 nM Cy5-PCNA), a dramatic enhancement of I<sub>670</sub> was observed compared to Cy5-PCNA alone (20 nM). Furthermore, a concomitant decrease in I<sub>570</sub> was observed compared to Cy3-pol \u03b7 alone (200 nM). Such behavior is diagnostic of a FRET signal and indicates a protein-protein interaction between Cy3-pol \u03b7 and Cy5-PCNA."

In order to maintain physiological ionic strength (200 mM), higher concentrations of pol \u03b4 could not be added and, hence, a complete binding curve could not be obtained.

These findings suggest that pol exchange during TLS may be driven by the P/T DNA binding affinity of pol \u03b7. To gauge this possibility, we first analyzed formation of the pol \u03b7\u2022PCNA\u2022P/T DNA complex (that\u00a0is a holoenzyme) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Pol \u03b7 holoenzyme formation increased with pol \u03b7 concentration (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and displayed hyperbolic behavior with a K<sub>D</sub> (28.0\u00a0\u00b1 5.38 nM) identical to that measured for pol \u03b7 binding to P/T DNA (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This suggests that pol \u03b7 holoenzyme assembly is governed by the affinity of pol \u03b7 for the P/T DNA, in stark contrast to that observed previously for pol \u03b4 under similar conditions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hedglin et al., 2013b</a>). Pol \u03b4 binds to P/T DNA with dramatically low affinity (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) yet holoenzyme formation increased linearly, plateaued when the concentrations of pol \u03b4 and PCNA were equivalent, and flat-lined thereafter (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Thus, pol \u03b4 binds much tighter to PCNA encircling a P/T junction than to P/T DNA alone (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Altogether, these studies indicate that assembly of a pol \u03b4 holoenzyme is governed by the tighter affinity of pol \u03b4 for PCNA while pol \u03b7 holoenzyme assembly is dictated by the tighter affinity of pol \u03b7 for P/T DNA. Thus, pol exchange during TLS may entail a competition between pol \u03b7 binding to the blocked P/T junction and pol \u03b4 binding to the PCNA encircling the blocked P/T junction.

(<b>A</b>) Schematic representation of the experiment depicted in <b>B</b> to monitor FRET under equilibrium conditions. A forked P/T DNA substrate (forked Cy3-P/T DNA) in agreement with the minimal requirements for assembly of human RFC and PCNA onto DNA was labeled with an internal Cy3 dye. This substrate also carries a 3\u2032-biotin label. Together with the flap, the 3\u2032-biotin label in complex with Neutravidin prevents loaded clamp from sliding off the DNA. Forked Cy3-P/T DNA (100 nM) was pre-incubated with Cy5-PCNA (100 nM), RFC (100 nM), and ATP (1 mM). Under these stoichiometric conditions, RFC loads all Cy5-PCNA onto Cy3-DNA and, in the absence of polymerase, dissociates back into solution taking all loaded PCNA with it. After the initial loading event, the clamp loading-unloading pathway reaches equilibrium where the rate constants for PCNA loading and unloading are equal and a net change in the FRET signal is no longer observed. At equilibrium, PCNA loading is highly-favored due to a much faster rate constant for PCNA loading compared to PCNA unloading (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hedglin et al., 2013b</a>). During holoenzyme formation, an incoming polymerase captures loaded PCNA from DNA-bound RFC, stabilizing the sliding clamp on DNA and increasing the fraction of bound forked Cy3-P/T DNA\u2022Cy5-PCNA. (<b>B</b>) The fractional saturation increased with free Pol \u03b7 concentration and displayed a hyperbolic behavior indicative of an equilibrium binding curve.

The line plateaued when the concentrations of total pol \u03b4, PCNA, and RFC were equivalent (100 nM of each), and flat-lined thereafter (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hedglin et al., 2013b</a>).

                                "text": "We utilized the TT P/T DNA substrate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) to monitor primer extension during a single DNA-binding event (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), as previously described (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hedglin et al., 2016</a>). The first two nucleotides of the template (directly abutting the P/T junction) are both thymine (T) and primer extension is indicated by insertion of a dNTP across from the 3\u2019 T of the template. Pol \u03b7 alone has substantial affinity for P/T DNA (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and will extend the primer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, panels <b>C</b> and <b>D</b>). However, extension beyond the 3\u2019 T is severely limited such that pol \u03b7 did not extend the primer more than 6 dNTPs. Thus, pol \u03b7 alone is inefficient at continuous DNA synthesis. In the presence of PCNA, primer extension is stimulated 2.02\u00a0\u00b1 0.173 fold (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Identical results were obtained with (Ub)<sub>3</sub>-PCNA, indicating that the binding of pol \u03b7 to a PCNA encircling a native P/T junction is independent of PCNA monoubiquitination. Furthermore, primer extension beyond the 3\u2019 T is more prominent in the presence of a PCNA such that pol \u03b7 extends the primer up to 10 dNTPs. Under the conditions of the assay, this behavior can be quantitatively analyzed at single nucleotide resolution (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hedglin et al., 2016</a>). The probability of insertion, <i>P<sub>i</sub></i>, can be directly measured for each dNTP insertion step, <i>i</i>, beyond <i>i</i>\u00a0=\u00a01. For pol \u03b7 alone, <i>P<sub>i</sub> </i>values are quite low (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Notably, <i>P<sub>2</sub> </i>is only 0.215\u00a0\u00b1 0.0333, indicating that the population of pol \u03b7 that inserts a dNTP across from the 5\u2019 T (<i>i</i>\u00a0=\u00a02) prior to dissociation is scarce. This population, <i>P</i><sub>2</sub>, is referred to herein as the pol \u03b7 TLS complex. In the presence of a PCNA, <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> values up to <i>i\u00a0=\u00a06</i> are increased compared to pol \u03b7 alone and the observed stimulations are equivalent for PCNA and (Ub)<sub>3</sub>-PCNA. Notably, the abundance of the pol \u03b7 TLS complex is increased 2.53\u00a0\u00b1 0.425 and 2.75\u00a0\u00b1 0.368 fold in the presence of PCNA and (Ub)<sub>3</sub>-PCNA, respectively. Insertion of dNTPs beyond <i>i</i>\u00a0=\u00a06 is only observed in the presence of a PCNA and the measured <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> values are equivalent in the presence of PCNA and (Ub)<sub>3</sub>-PCNA. Thus, binding to PCNA increases the <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> for pol \u03b7 independently of PCNA monoubiquitination but the effect is transient such that the extent of continuous DNA synthesis is only marginally enhanced. The latter behavior is in stark contrast to that observed for pol \u03b4 on the same substrate. Pol \u03b4 alone binds to P/T DNA with dramatically low affinity (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and will not extend the primer in the absence of PCNA (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), in agreement with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hedglin et al., 2016</a>). In the presence of PCNA, <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> is stimulated, plateaus at\u00a0~1.0 soon after DNA synthesis initiates, and remains constant until the pol \u03b4 holoenzyme approaches the end of the DNA template (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, anchoring to PCNA dramatically enhances the <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> for pol \u03b4 from 0.00 to\u00a0~1.0 and the effect is perpetual such that the extent of continuous DNA synthesis is substantially increased. Based on the <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> value within the plateau, a pol \u03b4 holoenzyme that initiates DNA synthesis from a P/T junction can extend the primer up to 4600 dNTPs prior to dissociation (0.999<sup>4600</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.010), in agreement with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hedglin et al., 2016</a>)."

Kinetically, <i>P<sub>i</sub> = k<sub>pol</sub></i>/(<i>k<sub>pol</sub></i> + <i>k<sub>off</sub></i>) where <i>k</i><sub>off</sub> and <i>k</i><sub>pol</sub> are the rate constants for dissociation of a pol into solution and dNTP insertion, respectively. Pol \u03b4, a replicative B-family pol, inserts complementary dNTPs very fast (<i>k</i><sub>pol</sub>\u00a0~\u00a0100 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) and maintains very high fidelity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hedglin et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Schmitt et al., 2009</a>). However, pol \u03b4 alone has very low affinity for P/T DNA and must anchor to PCNA to efficiently replicate DNA (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hedglin et al., 2016</a>). Pol \u03b4 binds much tighter to PCNA encircling DNA (<i>K<sub>D</sub></i>\u00a0&lt;10 nM, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) than to DNA alone (~537 nM, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and effectively captures a PCNA ring encircling a nascent P/T junction to initiate DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hedglin et al., 2013b</a>). Thus, anchoring to PCNA dramatically decreases <i>k<sub>off</sub></i> such that the <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> of pol \u03b4 increases from 0.0 to\u00a0~1.0 and the extent continuous dNTP insertion increases by kilobases (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Such behavior is befitting as pol \u03b4 is responsible for replicating the lagging strand during S-phase. On the other hand, Pol \u03b7, a Y-family TLS pol, also inserts dNTPs very fast (67 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) but has a compromised fidelity, inserting incorrect dNTPs up to 10<sup>3</sup>-fold more frequently than pol \u03b4 does on undamaged DNA (<a href=\"#bib29\">Matsuda et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Washington et al., 2003</a>). Hence, DNA synthesis by pol \u03b7 must be restricted to limit replication errors. Pol \u03b7 has significant binding affinity for P/T DNA (29.7 nM, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) such that it can replicate DNA in the absence of PCNA, albeit with distributive behavior (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In contrast to pol \u03b4, pol \u03b7 binds tighter to P/T DNA (29.7 nM, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) that to PCNA (111 nM, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Thus, anchoring to PCNA marginally decreases <i>k<sub>off\u00a0</sub></i>for pol \u03b7 such that the <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> increases only\u00a0~\u00a01.4\u20132.5-fold and the extent of continuous dNTP insertion increases by 4 nucleotides (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>).

In human cells, pol \u03b7 is also responsible for the error-free replication of CPDs during TLS (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yoon et al., 2009</a>). Next, we characterized the activity of pol \u03b7 on a P/T DNA substrate containing a thymine-thymine CPD (TT-CPD) directly abutting the P/T junction (T&lt;&gt;T P/T, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

Thus, a pol \u03b7 holoenzyme replicates a TT-CPD lesion and a native TT sequence with the same efficiency. Furthermore, <i>P</i><sub>3</sub> values measured in the presence of a PCNA are approximately the same for each substrate, indicating that a pol \u03b7 holoenzyme has the same probability of extending a primer one dNTP beyond the 5\u2019 T of a TT-CPD lesion as it does for the native TT sequence. Thus, binding of pol \u03b7 to a PCNA encircling a P/T junction generically increases the efficiency of DNA synthesis across an adjacent di-pyrimidine sequence. However, a clear divergence in the behavior of pol \u03b7 on the damaged and undamaged substrates is evident in the presence of a PCNA. <i>P<sub>i</sub> </i>for both substrates peaks at <i>i</i>\u00a0=\u00a04 and then decreases. On the undamaged substrate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), <i>P<sub>4</sub></i> is higher and <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> decreases such that\u00a0&gt;12.5% of the pol \u03b7 TLS complex extends the primer an additional 6 dNTPs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

This disparity is not observed in the absence of a PCNA. Thus, a pol \u03b7 holoenzyme is far less efficient at continuously extending a primer beyond a CPD lesion. In other words, replication of a CPD by a pol \u03b7 holoenzyme selectively promotes dissociation of pol \u03b7 downstream of the di-pyrimidine sequence.

In human cells irradiated with UV at the G<sub>1</sub>/S border, RPA foci rapidly built up, persisted through S-phase, and then disappeared primarily in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase when the bulk of chromosomal replication had been completed (<a href=\"#bib8\">Diamant et al., 2012</a>). An earlier study observed a similar trajectory for monoubiquitinated PCNA (<a href=\"#bib34\">Niimi et al., 2008</a>), which only resides on DNA in vivo (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hedglin and Benkovic, 2015</a>). Thus, the role(s) of monoubiquitinated PCNA during TLS may be initiated at the onset of S-phase and persist into G<sub>2</sub>/M. Given the large size of ssDNA stretches (100\u2019s to 1000\u2019s of nucleotides) and the remarkably low error rates observed in vivo\u00a0after UV exposure, this argues strongly against monoubiquitinated PCNA selectively and directly promoting error-prone DNA synthesis by TLS pols (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hedglin and Benkovic, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lange et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yoon et al., 2012</a>). This study demonstrates that the binding of pol \u03b7 to PCNA and the ensuing TLS across a UV-induced CPD are both independent of PCNA monoubiquitination. Furthermore, pol \u03b6, a B-family TLS pol implicated in TLS following UV exposure (see above), does not contain a ubiquitin-binding domain yet assembly of pol \u03b6 into replication foci at UV-induced lesions requires monoubiquitination of PCNA by Rad6/Rad18 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Makarova and Burgers, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yoon et al., 2015</a>). Together, this suggests that the role(s) of PCNA monoubiquitination in human TLS across and past a UV-induced DNA lesion is indirect. A recent study from our lab demonstrated that assembly/disassembly of a pol \u03b4 holoenzyme and continuous DNA synthesis by a pol \u03b4 holoenzyme are both independent of PCNA monoubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hedglin et al., 2016</a>). The ubiquitin moieties attached to PCNA do not alter the conformation of the sliding clamp ring (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dieckman et al., 2012</a>) nor do they shelter the region of PCNA that interacts with DNA pols (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tsutakawa et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2015</a>). Hence, monoubiquitination of PCNA is not envisioned to have any effect on DNA synthesis by a pol \u03b5 holoenzyme on a leading strand template. Collectively, this argues against PCNA monoubiquitination indirectly promoting TLS by destabilizing the replicative pol holoenzymes. In addition, this suggests the ubiquitin moieties attached to PCNA do not need to be removed immediately after TLS so that DNA synthesis by the replicative pols can resume. Indeed, de-ubiquitination of PCNA in human cells irradiated with UV does not occur until after the bulk of DNA synthesis (that\u00a0is S-phase) has been completed (<a href=\"#bib34\">Niimi et al., 2008</a>). We propose that the ubiquitin moieties conjugated to PCNA indirectly promote DNA synthesis in general at sites of DNA damage. One possibility is that monoubiquitinated PCNA alters the local chromatin structure encompassing a DNA lesion to promote DNA synthesis past and beyond the offending damage. In a recent study on human cells, pol \u03b7 was transiently immobilized within replication foci after treatment with DRAQ5, a DNA intercalating agent that temporarily disrupts chromatin structure without eliciting PCNA monoubiquitination or a DNA damage response (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sabbioneda et al., 2008</a>). This suggests that transient opening of chromatin promotes access of pol \u03b7 to DNA. In the same study, accumulation of pol \u03b7 into replication foci following UV irradiation was independent of PCNA monoubiquitination but monoubiquitinated PCNA increased the residence time of pol \u03b7 within the foci, similar to DRAQ5 treatment. Thus, it is possible that the ubiquitin moieties conjugated to PCNA facilitate the exposure of DNA at blocked P/T junctions. In humans, chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) deposits histones H3/H4 on nascent DNA immediately after passage of the replication fork, initiating nucleosome assembly. This process is mediated by a direct interaction between CAF-1 and PCNA left behind on the DNA (<a href=\"#bib42\">Shibahara and Stillman, 1999</a>). In cell-free extracts, CAF-1 efficiently triggers a progressing wave of nucleosome assembly on a gapped DNA substrate in the absence of DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib32\">Moggs et al., 2000</a>). Such activity may impede TLS in vivo by limiting the access of DNA pols to sites of DNA damage. The amino acid residues within a PCNA ring that are required for CAF-1 mediated histone deposition are far removed from the region of PCNA that interacts with replication proteins, including pols \u03b4 and \u03b7 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zhang et al., 2000</a>). Results from computational studies suggest that the ubiquitin moieties conjugated to PCNA at lysine residue(s) K164 could selectively block the CAF-1 binding sites on PCNA (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tsutakawa et al., 2015</a>). This may preclude the binding of CAF-1 to PCNA encircling a blocked P/T junction, inhibiting histone deposition until the offending DNA lesion is replicated. Further studies will test this hypothesis."

These amino acid residues are necessary for catalytic activity. In vivo, this full-length, human pol \u03b7 mutant retains all biological functions except DNA synthesis activity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bergoglio et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Durando et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rey et al., 2009</a>). Wild-type and catalytically-inactive pol \u03b7 was purified from the pET21A-hPol \u03b7 expression vector by slight modifications of a published protocol (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2013</a>). The protein concentration was determined from the calculated extinction coefficient (64010 M<sup>\u22121</sup>cm<sup>\u22121</sup>) and verified by Bradford assay using BSA as a protein standard. For N-terminally labeling pol \u03b7 with Cy3 NHS ester (GE healthcare UK Limited, Buckinghamshire, UK), Pol \u03b7 was exchanged into labeling buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 6.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol), mixed with a five-fold excess of Cy5 NHS ester, incubated for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C, and then loaded onto a G25 size exclusion column (GE healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) that had been pre-equilibrated with Pol \u03b7 storage buffer (25 mM tris pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 5 mM \u03b2-Mercaptoethanol). The column was developed with Pol \u03b7 storage buffer and the labeled protein fraction was collected and concentrated. The labeling efficiency (1.6 Cy3 dyes/pol \u03b7 protein on average) was calculated according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The concentration of active pol \u03b7 was determined by active site titration according to a published protocol (<a href=\"#bib46\">Washington et al., 2003</a>). Wild-type and Cy3-labeled retained more than 95 and 80% activity, respectively. All concentrations of pol \u03b7 indicated throughout the text refer to the final concentration of active protein.

The fluorescence emission intensity maxima for the Cy3 donor (I<sub>570</sub>) and the Cy5 acceptor (I<sub>670</sub>) occur at 570 nm and 670 nm, respectively. In the presence of both Cy3-pol \u03b7 and Cy5-PCNA, a FRET is indicated by an increase in I<sub>670</sub> and a concomitant decrease in I<sub>570</sub>. This can be quantified by monitoring the I<sub>670</sub>/I<sub>570</sub> ratio. For the experiments depicted in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, Cy5-PCNA (20 nM) and Cy3-Pol \u03b7 (200 nM) were pre-incubated, excited at 514 nm, and the fluorescence emission intensity was recorded from 540 to 750 nm. For the direct titration experiments depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure\u00a01A</a> and 20 nM Cy3-Pol \u03b7 was pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of Cy5-PCNA, excited at 514 nm, and the fluorescence emission intensity at 570 nm (Cy3 donor fluorescence emission maximum, I<sub>570</sub>) was measured. In order to account for the signal generated from Cy5-PCNA, each value was corrected for by the corresponding I<sub>570</sub> value obtained in the absence of pol \u03b7. The donor fluorescence quenching efficiency (E<sub>dq</sub>) was then calculated at each Cy5-PCNA concentration by the equation E<sub>dq</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01-I<sub>DA/</sub>I<sub>D</sub>, where I<sub>DA</sub> and I<sub>A</sub> are the I<sub>570</sub> values obtained in the presence and absence of Cy5-PCNA, respectively. The data was analyzed as described below for an equilibrium binding assay. For the competitive titration experiments depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, the Cy3-Pol \u03b7\u2022Cy5-PCNA complex (200 nM Cy3-Pol \u03b7, 20 nM Cy5-PCNA) was pre-assembled, an unlabeled PCNA was added (either PCNA or (Ub)<sub>3</sub>-PCNA, 0\u20135 \u03bcM), and then the I<sub>670</sub>/I<sub>670</sub> ratio was measured. As a control to demonstrate that Cy3 does not affect the interaction between pol \u03b7 and PCNA, these assays were repeated with pol \u03b7 (0\u20135 \u03bcM) as the unlabeled competitor (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The data was analyzed as described below for competitive inhibition assays. For holoenzyme assembly depicted in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, RFC (100 nM), Cy5-PCNA (100 nM) and Cy3-P/T DNA (100 nM) were pre-incubated in the presence of 1 mM ATP. Increasing concentrations of unlabeled Pol \u03b7 were then added and the I<sub>670</sub>/I<sub>570</sub> ratio was measured. The data was analyzed as described below for equilibrium binding assays. For the FRET-based competition assays (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), the competitive primer extension assays (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) were repeated using a TT P/T DNA substrate containing a 5\u2019 Cy3-label on the primer (Cy3-TT P/T, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and Cy5-PCNA. Under these conditions, pol \u03b4 (50 nM) stabilizes Cy5-PCNA (50 nM) on the Cy3-TT P/T DNA substrate (10 nM), maximizing the FRET signal. After a 5 min incubation with various concentrations of \u2018dead\u2019 pol \u03b7 (0\u20131 \u03bcM), the FRET signal (I<sub>670</sub>/I<sub>570</sub>) was measured.
