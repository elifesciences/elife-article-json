We investigated this question by recording from the supplementary eye field (SEF) of monkeys during a gambling task that allowed us to distinguish chosen good from chosen action signals. Analysis of the individual neuron activity, as well as of the population state-space dynamic, showed that SEF encodes first the chosen gamble option (the desired economic good) and only ~100 ms later the saccade that will obtain it (the chosen action). The action selection is likely driven by inhibitory interactions between different SEF neurons. Our results suggest that during value-based decisions, the selection of economic goods precedes and guides the selection of actions. The two selection steps serve different functions and can therefore not compensate for each other, even when information guiding both processes is given simultaneously."

Currently it is still unclear how the brain compares value signals and uses them to select an action (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cisek, 2012</a>). The goods-based model of decision-making (<a href=\"#bib28\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</a>) suggests that the brain computes the subjective value of each offer, selects one of these option value signals, and then prepares the appropriate action plan (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Support for this model comes from recording studies in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during an economic choice task (<a href=\"#bib27\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2012</a>). In contrast, the action-based model of decision\u00a0making (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tosoni et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Christopoulos et al., 2015a</a>) suggests that all potential actions are represented in the brain in parallel and compete with each other (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This competition is influenced by a variety of factors including the value of each actions\u2019 outcome. According to this model, option value signals should not predict the chosen option, since these signals only serve as input into the decision process, which is determined by the competition among the potential actions. Support for this model comes primarily from recording studies in parietal and premotor cortex (<a href=\"#bib29\">Platt and Glimcher, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sugrue et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Shadlen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Christopoulos et al., 2015b</a> )."

The monkeys indicated their choice by making a saccade to the cue indicating the desired gamble option. Across different trials, the visual cues were presented in different locations and required saccades in different directions to be chosen. This allowed us to distinguish the selection of gamble options or economic goods from the selection of actions. We found that the activity of SEF neurons predicted the monkey\u2019s choice. Importantly, this decision process unfolded sequentially. First, the chosen gamble option was selected and only then the chosen action. The saccade selection process seemed to be driven by competition between directionally tuned SEF neurons. Our findings are not in agreement with any of the previously suggested models (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). Instead, they support a new sequential decision model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). According to this model, at the beginning of the decision two selection processes start independently on the goods and action level. Our data indicate that the SEF activity is part of the action selection process. The action selection process receives input from the goods selection. However, due to the absence of recurrent feedback, the goods selection process does not receive input from the action selection process. Once the competition on the goods level is resolved, the value signals for the chosen gamble option increase in strength and the ones for the non-chosen one decrease in strength. This activity difference cascades downward to the action level and determines the outcome of the action selection."

The maximum and minimum reward amounts were indicated by the color of the target. The portion of a color within the target corresponded to the probability of receiving the reward amount (see experimental procedures). We estimated the subjective value for each target based on the choice preference of the monkeys for all combinations of options (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Maloney and Yang, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kingdom and Prins, 2010</a>). The subjective value estimate (referred to in the rest of the paper as \u2018value\u2019) is measured on a relative scale, with 0 and 1 being the least and most preferred option in our set. Consistent with earlier findings (<a href=\"#bib37\">So and Stuphorn, 2010</a>), the mean saccade reaction times during no-choice trials were significantly negatively correlated with the value of the target (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, monkey B: t(5)\u00a0=\u00a08.40, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03; monkey I: t(5)\u00a0=\u00a027.35, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). On choice trials, the mean reaction times were significantly correlated with the signed value difference between chosen and non-chosen targets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, monkey A: t(40)\u00a0=\u00a0159.23, p&lt;10\u00a0<sup>\u201314</sup>; monkey I: t(38)\u00a0=\u00a016.18, p&lt;10<sup>\u20134</sup>). Please note that there were a small number of trials with very negative value differences indicating that during these trials the monkey chose a normally non-preferred option. The unusually short reaction time in these trials suggests that the choices were not driven by the normal value-based decision process. These other mechanisms may include history effects, spatial selection bias, express saccades, lapse of attention to the task, and other factors. For this reason, these trials were excluded from the analysis and are marked by a separate color."

To confirm this finding, we employed an independent information theoretic analysis to study how SEF activity encoded the chosen and non-chosen gamble option, as well as the chosen and non-chosen direction throughout the decision process (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We used 106 neurons which were tested with at least 8 out of 12 possible target position combinations. We assumed that the onset of significantly more information about the chosen than the non-chosen variable in the neural firing rate indicated the moment at which the selection process had finished and the choice could be predicted. This moment was reached 66 ms earlier for gamble option information (113 ms before saccade onset; permutation test adjusted for multiple comparison, p\u22640.05) than for saccade direction information (47 ms before saccade onset; permutation test adjusted for multiple comparisons, p\u22640.05). Thus, the onset and timing of the information representation in SEF is consistent with the results of the classification analysis and also indicates a sequential decision process."

(<b>B</b>) The neural activity in those choice trials, in which the chosen target had the highest possible value (7 units). We chose this reference point, instead of a medium value (as in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), because it allowed us to a comparison with the widest possible range of non-chosen target values (indicated by the color of the spike density histograms: high value\u00a0=\u00a05\u20136 units; medium value =\u00a03\u20134 units; low value\u00a0=\u00a01\u20132 units). (<b>C</b>) The neural activity in those choice trials, in which the non-chosen target had the lowest possible value (1 unit). Again, this reference point allowed for the widest possible range of chosen target values (indicated by the color of the spike density histograms: high value\u00a0=\u00a06\u20137 units; medium value =\u00a04\u20135 units; low value\u00a0=\u00a02\u20133 units).

This is true, whether the PD or the NPD target is chosen. However, the value of the chosen target has a stronger influence than the non-chosen one, and in the extreme case, when the PD target has the highest possible value and is chosen, the NPD value has no longer a significant effect on the neural activity (<b>B</b>: right panel)."

First, there are signals that represent the value of the alternative actions irrespective of the choice. These signals represent the decision variables on which the decision process is based and are commonly referred to as \u2018action value\u2019 signals. Second, there are signals that encode the central step in the decision process, namely the comparison between the values of the alternative actions.

However, the value of NPD targets clearly modulated the response of the SEF neurons to the PD targets in choice trials (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). To isolate the effect that targets in the two directions have on the neural activity, we first held the value of the NPD target constant at a medium amount and compared the SEF population activity across trials with PD targets of varying value (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The neural activity clearly increased with the value of the PD target (regression coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.119, t(5)\u00a0=\u00a010.629, p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Next, we held the value of the PD target constant at a medium value and compared the population activity across trials with NPD targets of varying value (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The neural activity clearly decreased with the value of the NPD target (regression coefficient=-0.058, t(5)=-4.345, p=0.007; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Thus, the SEF neurons represented a relative action value signal. The value of the PD target influences the SEF activity about twice as large as the value of the NPD target. This means that the SEF neurons do not encode the exact value difference. Nevertheless, the opposing influence of the targets indicates that SEF represents the essential step in decision-making, namely a comparison of the relative value of the available actions. All these effects were present well before saccade onset (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and did not depend on the chosen saccade direction (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Similar activity pattern can also be observed if pooling together all task related neurons (N=353, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In contrast, the neurons were not significantly influenced by the relative spatial location of each target (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

In modeling the neural activity in choice trials, we used each neurons\u2019 activity in no-choice trials as a predictor of its response in choice trials. Specifically, we modeled the neural activity as a weighted sum of the activity in no-choice trials for saccades to targets with the same gamble option or direction as the chosen and non-chosen targets in the choice trials. The strength of the coefficients is a measure of the relative influence that each target has on the neural activity in a particular time period during the decision process. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> shows the time course of the coefficient strength for the chosen and non-chosen target when we sorted trials either by gamble option or saccade direction. In both cases, the correlation coefficients for the two targets were initially of equal value, indicating that the SEF neurons reflected each target equally during this time period. However, 110 ms before saccade onset (permutation test adjusted for multiple comparisons, p\u22640.05) the strength of the chosen gamble option coefficient started to rise, while the non-chosen gamble coefficient strength stayed the same. Later in the trial, 60 ms before saccade onset (permutation test adjusted for multiple comparisons, p\u22640.05) the coefficient strength for the chosen saccade direction increased. Simultaneously, the coefficient strength for the non-chosen saccade direction decreased. The results of the regression analysis allow a number of conclusions about the mechanism underlying decision-making and the role of SEF in it. First, the results confirm the findings of the decoding and encoding analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and indicate that the decision process involves a sequence of two different selection processes. Second, the opposing pattern of influence on neural activity in the case of saccade direction suggests that the latter action selection step could involve at least partially the SEF. The mechanism underlying this selection involves competition between the action value signals associated with the two saccade targets. Thus, the increasing influence of one target leads simultaneously to a decreasing influence of the other target. However, the neural activity associated with the earlier gamble option selection step does not show such a pattern of competing influences. Instead, the influence of the chosen option just increases. That indicates that the choice of an economic good does not involve competitive interactions between SEF neurons. Instead, only the output of the gamble option selection is represented in SEF. This signal could reflect input from other brain regions."

Together these neurons form a map encoding the relative value of all possible saccades during the decision process. Our analysis of the activity pattern in individual neurons suggested that the action selection relied on competition between different relative action value signals. In that case, the relative action value map in SEF should contain different groups of neurons that represent the competing relative action values of the two saccade choices. If the activities of these two groups of neurons indeed reflect inhibitory competition, the selection of a particular action should lead to increased activity of the neurons representing the chosen and decreased activity in the neurons representing the non-chosen saccade. Furthermore, the inhibition that the winning neurons can exert on the losing neurons should depend on their relative strength. We should therefore see differences in the dynamic of the neural activity within the relative action value map if we compare trials with small or large value differences."

We divided therefore the choice trials into two groups with small (value difference smaller than 0.4) and large value differences (value difference larger or equal to 0.4), while controlling that the mean chosen value in both conditions was the same (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). As predicted, the neural activity associated with the non-chosen target was stronger and lasted longer, when the value differences were small (onset of significant activity difference for chosen target and non-chosen target was 68 ms before saccade onset for small value difference trial and 42 ms before saccade onset for large value difference trials; permutation test adjusted for multiple comparisons, <math id=\"inf5\"><mtext>p</mtext><mo>\u2264</mo><mn>0.05</mn></math>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>).

However, during the initial rise in activity the SEF population does not indicate the value of the target in its PD. At the time, when the neurons start to differentiate their activity according to the value of the target in the preferred direction they also reflect the value of the target in the NPD. This can be seen very clearly in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> showing the activity of SEF neurons for PD targets of medium value. Depending on the value of the NPD target, the activity starts to change ~110\u2013120 ms after target onset. However, it took this much time for the SEF neurons to indicate value even during no-choice trials, when there was no competing target. It seems therefore that the SEF neurons always indicate relative action value. There is no time period in which two populations of SEF neurons represent the absolute action value of a target independent of the value of any competing target. Nevertheless, there is clear evidence of a succession of an initial undifferentiated state to a more and more differentiated state in which the influence of the chosen action value on the neuronal activity increases and the influence of the non-chosen one decreases (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>).

As the previous analyses show, the activity pattern of individual SEF neurons during the decision process is not completely independent from each other, but follows particular pattern. The movement of SEF activity state trajectories in a lower-dimensional sub-space captured therefore most of the relationship between the SEF activity state and the behaviorally relevant task variables (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We estimated this task-related subspace by using linear regression to define three orthogonal axis: chosen saccade direction along the horizontal and vertical dimension, and value of the chosen option (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mante et al., 2013</a>)."

If no-choice trials simply represent a situation that is similar to the choice trials, but in which the non-chosen value is simply zero, the trajectories for no-choice trial should be similar to the ones on choice trials with small non-chosen value. However, that is not the case. Instead, the trajectories for no-choice trials always reach an end point that is less extended along both the value and direction axis than the respective trajectories for choice trials. Thus, the neural population responds differently on choice and no-choice trials.\u00a0SEF, supplementary eye field."

In addition, the trajectories for different chosen value are also separate from each other along the value axis (as indicated by different line style).

As a result, the trajectories reach different positions in 3-D task space at the moment of saccade initiation, and their distance is significantly correlated with the difference in chosen value for all four different saccade directions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Our previous analysis suggests that the neurons encoding the relative action value of saccades in different direction compete through mutual inhibition. This mutual inhibition should change the direction and endpoint of the different trajectories, so that they should not only depend on the saccade direction and subjective value of the chosen target, but also on the value of the non-chosen target. To test this, for a fixed direction and chosen value, we computed the distance between the trajectory with the largest non-chosen value and all other trajectories with decreasing non-chosen values. The regression analysis shows that, when saccade direction and chosen value is fixed, the distance between trajectories is significantly modulated by non-chosen value (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). The larger the non-chosen value difference is the further apart the trajectories are when the saccade is initiated. This can also be observed by comparing population activity trajectories in the state space (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, the trajectories in state space reflect both the chosen and the non-chosen target values. In this context, no-choice trials could be considered as choice trials with zero non-chosen value. In this case, one would expect the trajectory to be similar to the trials with large chosen and small unchosen value. However, this is not the case (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although trajectories for no-choice trials are also modulated by both value and direction, they always reach a point along both the value and direction axis that is less extended than during choice trials."

Consistent with this observation and the single neuron analysis, the variance explained by value axis increased earlier than the variance explained by saccade direction axis (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

During value-based decisions, the SEF population first encodes the chosen gamble option and only later the chosen direction. Our data suggest that neural activity in SEF reflects the action selection, the second step in the decision process. This selection process occurs likely through a process of competitive inhibition between groups of neurons carrying relative action value signals for different saccades. This inhibition could occur locally between SEF neurons, either through mutual inhibition between different SEF neurons within the relative action value map, or through a global pool of inhibitory neurons that receive input from excitatory neurons in SEF (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schlag et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wang, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Nassi et al., 2015</a>). Alternatively, the neural activity in SEF and the competitive process manifested by it could reflect shared signals within the more distributed action selection network that SEF is part of. Similar action value signals have been reported in lateral prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib25\">Matsumoto et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wallis and Miller, 2003</a>), anterior cingulate cortex (<a href=\"#bib25\">Matsumoto et al., 2003</a>), and basal ganglia (<a href=\"#bib30\">Samejima et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lau and Glimcher, 2008</a>). Of course, it is also possible that the action selection involves both interactions between neurons in a larger network and local inhibitory interactions. Future perturbation experiments will be required to test whether SEF plays a causal role in decision making and also if the relative action value encoding is at least partly the result of local inhibitory mechanism or whether it reflects only input from connected brain regions. Independent of these considerations, our results allow us to draw some conclusions about the basic functional architecture of decision making in the brain. Specifically, they invalidate a number of previously suggested decision models and instead support a new sequential model of decision\u00a0making."

Our gamble experiment design allows us to test these models by dissociating the value selection process from the action selection process. Due to the uncertainty of reward for each individual gamble, the large number of the gamble option pairs, and the fact that each gamble option pairing could be presented in multiple spatial configurations, the task design prevent the subjects from making direct associations between the visual representation of the gamble options and action choice. Therefore, the task required on each trial a good-based, as well as an action-based selection."

                        "text": "Our findings support none of the previously suggested models. First, the pure good-based model of decision\u00a0making would predict that action-related representations are downstream of the decision stage and should therefore only represent the decision outcome (i.e. the chosen action; see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, we found evidence for competition between relative action value-encoding neurons in SEF that is spatially organized, that\u00a0is, in an action-based frame of reference (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This fact, together with the fact that we find activity corresponding to both response options (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) clearly rules out the pure good-based model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Second, the pure action-selection model B would predict that the competition would only happen in the action value space. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, this is indicated by the absence of inhibitory connections between the nodes representing the reward options (or goods). This model therefore predicts that information about chosen saccade direction should appear simultaneously with or even slightly earlier than information about chosen reward option, since the selected action value signal contains both direction and value information. However, this prediction is contradicted by our observation that the chosen value information is present earlier than the chosen action information (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Thus, there is a moment during the decision-making process (100\u201350 ms before saccade onset), when the SEF neurons encode which option is chosen, but not yet, what saccade will be chosen. This could clearly never happen in an action-selection model of decision-making. Lastly, the distributed consensus model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) suggests strong recurrent connections from the action selection level back to the option selection level. The reciprocal interaction should lead to a synchronization of the selection process in both stages and the chosen gamble option and chosen action should be selected simultaneously. This prediction is clearly not supported by our findings, given the robust 100\u00a0ms time difference in the onset of chosen option and direction information."

This is the sequential model of decision\u00a0making (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). According to this model, value-based decisions require two different selection processes within two different representational spaces. First, a preferred option has to be chosen within an offer or goods space by comparing their value representations (<a href=\"#bib28\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</a>). Second, within an action space the response has to be chosen that most likely will bring about the preferred option. A similar sequence has been found, when initially only information relevant for the selection of an economic good is provided, and information relevant for the selection of an action is only given after a delay (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014</a>). Here, we show that this sequence is obligatory, since it even occurs, when information guiding the selection of goods and actions is given simultaneously. This suggests that these two selection steps are related, but functionally independent from each other and involve different brain circuits. This explains why evidence for decision-related neural activity has been found at both selection stages (<a href=\"#bib35\">Shadlen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wunderlich et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cisek, 2012</a>). A similar separation between stimulus categorization and action selection has been also found in other decision processes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Schall, 2013</a>). The competition between subjective value representations takes most likely place in OFC (<a href=\"#bib27\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</a>) and vmPFC (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wunderlich et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lim et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Strait et al., 2014</a>), while the competition between action value representations takes place in SEF and DLPFC (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wallis and Miller, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kim et al., 2008</a>). The selection of action value signals in turn can influence the neural activity in primarily motor-related areas, such as FEF and SC that encode the final commitment to a particular course of action (<a href=\"#bib31\">Schall et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Brown et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Thura and Cisek, 2014</a>)."

In contrast, our sequential decision model predicts that decisions are always made using the same decision architecture: an initial goods-based selection, followed by action-based selection, because both stages are necessary and not functionally interchangeable. Nevertheless, the relative importance of each selection stages likely depends on the behavioral context. To understand strictly economic behavior (such as savings behavior or consumption of goods) the goods selection is the more important step. Preferred options can be selected without knowledge about the action necessary to indicate the chosen option (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gold and Shadlen, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bennur and Gold, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Grabenhorst et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014</a>). In such situations, there is no evidence of ongoing competition between potential actions (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2014</a>). Obtaining a desired good is typically considered to be a trivial act in a well-functioning market (<a href=\"#bib28\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</a>). On the other hand during perceptual or rule-based decision making, the action selection is the most important step in the decision process, because only one type of good can be achieved by engaging in the task. An example are competitive games such as chess, were the goal (checkmate) is clear and implicitly chosen when a player starts a game, but were the player still has to find the most appropriate actions to achieve this goal. This implies that within different behavioral contexts, different elements of the decision circuit become critical. Altogether, we think that actual behavior under a wide range of different conditions is best understood by a model that respects that behavioral choices are the result of two independent and functionally different selection mechanisms."

At the same time, it pulled the plunger of the other syringe outward and sucked fluid into the syringe from the fluid container. The position of the piston was controlled by a stepper motor. In this way, the size of the piston movement controlled the amount of fluid that was ejected out of one of the syringes.

Often, the influence of expected value on neuronal activity is described using a linear function. However, SEF neurons are better described using a sigmoid function. The reasons for this are twofold: 1) Many SEF neurons actually had a \u2018curved\u2019 relationship with increasing value (<a href=\"#bib37\">So and Stuphorn, 2010</a>). 2) The more important reason is that a substantial number of value-related SEF neurons showed floor or ceiling effects, that is, they showed no modulation for value increases in a certain range, but started to indicate value above or below a certain threshold. In addition, the sigmoid function is flexible enough to easily approximate a linear value coding. In <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>, by setting t=0.5, b1&gt;1, the relatively linear part of the sigmoid function can be used for value coding. Thus, the sigmoid function is flexible enough to fit the behavior of a large number of neurons with monotonically increasing or decreasing activity for varying value (including linearly related ones)."

For each neuron, we generated the mean firing rate separately for all 16 combinations of choices and target configurations (choice trials: 12; no-choice trials: 4). The neuron\u2019s firing rate was normalized by setting the baseline activity (mean activity between 50 to 0 before target onset across 16 conditions) to 0 and the maximum activity across all 16 conditions to 1. Each cell's preferred direction was defined by the circular Gaussian term in the best fitting model in the BIC analysis. Population data were displayed as a 2D color plot, in which the spike density functions of each neuron were sorted along the vertical axis according to their preferred direction with respect to the location of the selected target. This resulted in a matrix in which the PD distribution within the relative action value map was unevenly sampled. The sorted matrix was therefore smoothed by linear interpolation at an angle of 7.2\u00b0. The horizontal axis showed the development of the population activity across time aligned to either target or movement onset. For all population maps, the same baseline activity and maximum activity were used for each neuron."

We then used the classifier to predict either the direction or the value of the chosen target for each trial. When predicting the chosen direction, for example, there are two target locations in a choice trial. We used the neural activity in all choice trials when the monkey chose either one of the target locations to train the classifier, and then used the optimized classifier to predict the chosen saccade direction based on the observed neural activity in a particular trial. The overall classification accuracy was calculated by averaging across all trials for each neuron.

There is also general agreement that subjective values are computed in the OFC/vmPFC, with the possible participation of other areas such as the amygdala. However, there is no general consensus of where and how exactly subjective values are compared to make a decision. Several models have been put forth in the past few years, as described in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> of this manuscript. These models are not necessarily mutually exclusive \u2013 for example, Paul Cisek who proposed the \"distributed consensus\" model, also pointed out that economic decisions can be made in a good-based representation (Cisek, 2012). However, even if one accepts the idea that each model has some domain of applicability, data shedding light on the relative extent of these domains are very valuable. In this study Chen and Stuphorn use a clever task design, in which monkeys choose between different gambles. Across trials, the expected values of the chosen and non-chosen gambles vary in ways that allow several insightful analyses. The animals revealed their choices through eye movements and the authors recorded and analyzed the activity of neurons in the supplementary eye fields (SEF). Contrary to most neurophysiology studies, here the trial structure did not impose a delay between the offer and the saccade targets, which provided a measure of the RTs as a function of the decision difficulty. The lack of a delay imposed particular care in the analysis of neuronal data, but the senior author is an expert of this sort of analyses and the approach(es) taken here are adequate. The main results of the study are (1) both information about value options and saccade directions are present in the SEF, (2) the decision between values is resolved significantly earlier than that between actions, and (3) in SEF there is evidence of mutual inhibition between the signals associated to different possible saccades (but this effect is not present in signals associated to different possible values). The authors conclusions are (A) in this task design decisions are made sequentially, first in goods space (selection of one value/option) and then in actions space (selection of a suitable action) and (B) SEF participates in the process of action selection, but not in the process of value/option selection. For the reasons outlined above, (A) is particularly notable because the task design did not impose or even invite monkeys to make the primary choice in goods space. In other words, this would have been a perfect situation for an action-based decision, but even in this situation the evidence is against that model. The authors thus propose a new \"sequential decision\" model, which differs from the good-based model in that both possible actions are computed and selected between. My view of the study is positive overall, although I have several reservations. The experiment was well designed, the data analysis is for the most part credible, and the discussion of the results is mostly appropriate. My main concerns are due to the fact that in a number of circumstances the authors do not provide sufficient information and/or their description is unclear \u2013 specific instances are indicated below. I'd like to see a revision of the paper, but if the authors can address these issues adequately, I would consider the study worth of publication."

It appears that 353 cells were task-related, but only about one third of them made it into the analysis. Was this because the remaining 2/3 did not have a response field? I thought that the majority of neurons in SEF are selective for saccades in some direction. Also, the authors established the \"influence\" of value using the function in <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>. I am not sure where this function came from, but there are many cases in the literature in which value was encoded in a linear way, which is at odds with the present assumption. The authors should elaborate on their criteria and also test alternative forms of value encoding."

However, the authors repeatedly state that neurons encode the <i>difference</i> in action values. This is a much more stringent statement and there is no evidence to support it. For example, the influence of NPD could be through mechanisms of divisive normalization akin to those observed in area LIP (Louie et al.). If the value modulation was really according to the value difference, one would expect the two regression coefficients shown in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> to be similar in absolute value. In contrast, the absolute value of the regression coefficient for PD is roughly twice that for NPD. Incidentally, the authors should provide a confidence interval for these coefficients."

But it is not clear that this is the most appropriate way to think about the data. In many studies, non-choice trials are considered forced choices in which simply one of the two values is zero, and all trials are pooled. This is relevant to the issue discussed in the previous point because if the value modulations was according to the value difference, forced choices in the PD should present the highest activity, and forced choices in the NPD should present the lowest activity (all for given chosen value). I don't see evidence of this in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, comparing panes A and B, although I am not sure how exactly the activity was normalized for these plots (please describe). Also, it would be good to see the equivalent of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> for no-choice, NPD trials."

For example, context effects of the sort described here are relatively minor in area MT, even though neurons in MT clearly participate in, or are upstream of, the decision. Similarly, \"offer value\" cells in OFC, which are thought to provide the input for value-based decisions, don't show such effects of mutual inhibition. So this is a tricky argument, even though I agree that neurons in SEF are likely downstream of the decision between values while they participate in the decision between actions."

They examined neural activity in the SEF while monkeys carried out the task and found that the representation of the chosen option occurred about 120 ms before saccade onset and then decreased before the representation of the chosen direction about 40 ms before saccade onset. They further found that the response to reward magnitude did not scale responses in the unchosen direction; the response in the chosen direction did depend on the target that was not chosen. Further, there was an increase in activity for neurons that represented both the chosen and unchosen options before the activity diverged and began to represent almost only the chosen option.

This is illustrated in the revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, which shows the activity of the SEF neurons during no-choice trials, i.e. when only one target appears on the screen. While the SEF neurons are strongly active for saccades into the preferred direction and show value-related modulations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), they are not active for saccades into the non-preferred direction, even when this leads to large reward amounts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We agree with the reviewer that the definition of \u2018preferred direction\u2019 (PD) is important and should be in a prominent place. In the revised manuscript, we added an explanation in the Results section, when we first refer to PD (subsection \u201cSEF neurons reflect the value of both choice options in an opposing way\u201d). In addition, we explain how PD is estimated in more detail in the Method part of our manuscript. We used a nonlinear regression to estimate value modulation and direction modulation simultaneously for each neuron. Therefore, the estimation of preferred direction is based on the residual neuronal activity variation, after the influence of reward was taken into account. In addition, in our experiment design, all the directions were assigned with all possible reward. Thus, the reward amount and direction was dissociated from each other (across different trials)."

They could simply reflect activity in SEF that is correlated with the decision process that takes place in other brain areas, or they could reflect inhibitory processes within SEF. Likewise, local inhibitory processes could take the form of specific mutual inhibition between SEF neurons with different PD, or global inhibition, or a mixture of both. Accordingly, we followed the suggestion of the editor and shifted text describing the interpretation of the result to the Discussion section. We left some references to inhibitory interactions in the Results section to motivate particular analyses. Without it, we felt the paper would be harder to follow."

It is indeed true that earlier recording studies in SEF have reported that large majorities of SEF neurons showed saccade direction-related selectivity (Schlag and Schlag-Rey, 1987; Schall, 1991; Schlag et al., 1992; Chen and Wise, 1995a, b; Hanes et al., 1995; Olson and Gettner, 1995; Russo and Bruce, 1996, 2000; Isoda and Tanji, 2002; Moorman and Olson, 2007; Stuphorn et al., 2010). However, most of these studies were performed with only one electrode at a time, and often with the capability to record only the action potentials of one neuron at a time (this was simply the technical standard in the 80-90ies of the last century). This required the use of strong selection criteria for recording neurons. Typically, a researcher would search for some time within a population of neurons for cells, whose activity patterns are of interest. Clearly, such a recording scheme introduces a strong recording bias. Therefore, the numbers concerning the frequency of neurons with particular functional criteria in older papers has to be taken cautiously. In contrast, in our study we used multiple electrodes (2-4) and we were able to identify an unlimited number of individual spike waveforms, since we recorded the analog voltage recording at each electrode (the current technical standard). We also started to record only after we had found at least one \u2018interesting\u2019 neuron on an electrode, but nevertheless we recorded a much larger number of surrounding SEF neurons. Accordingly, our sample of recorded SEF neurons includes a much larger number of \u2018randomly\u2019 sampled neurons. It is therefore maybe not too much of a surprise that we found a large number of neurons that did not seem to be engaged in the task."

We were interested in neurons with saccade-direction modulation and selected neurons according to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as described in the Methods (subsection \u201cTask-related neurons\u201c). The BIC is a very strict criterion, and therefore a large number of neurons with weak direction or value modulation were not included in the analysis.

The reason we used a sigmoid instead of a linear function is because it resulted in a better fit and in a larger number of neurons in which we could describe the relationship with value. The reasons for this are two-fold: 1) Many SEF neurons actually had a \u2018curved\u2019 relationship with increasing value. An example of this is shown in Figure 9 from So and Stuphorn (2010). 2) The more important reason is that a substantial number of value-related SEF neurons showed floor or ceiling effects, that is, they showed no modulation for value increases in a certain range, but started to indicate value above or below a certain threshold. In general, we agree with the reviewer that many neurons encode value in a relative linear way. However, the sigmoid function is flexible enough to easily approximate a linear value coding. For example, in <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>, by setting t=0.5, b1&gt;1, the relatively linear part of the sigmoid function then can be used for value coding. Thus, the sigmoid function is flexible enough to fit the behavior of a large number of neurons with monotonically increasing or decreasing activity for varying value (including linearly related ones). The main concern of the reviewer, namely that we might have missed such neurons seems therefore unwarranted. Of course, it might be argued that the additional parameters of the sigmoid function are not necessary to capture the main trend and that there might be a danger of over-fitting. However, this seems unlikely, given the fact that the BIC criterion was rather selective (see #1 above). In any case, we used the multiple regression analysis only for classification purposes. None of the main analysis depends on using the sigmoid function."

Our reference to the \u2018difference in action value\u2019 was meant as a description of the fact that the SEF neurons represent the action value strength of saccades in the preferred direction relative to the strength of saccades in the non-preferred direction. Thus, they signal a relative, not absolute, action value signal. The reviewer is of course quite right in pointing out that our terminology is misleading. Clearly, the effect of the negative modulation by alternative targets is not as strong as the effect of the positive modulation by the preferred target. This is in fact an interesting finding and we now note it in the revised manuscript (subsection \u201cSEF neurons reflect the value of both choice options in an opposing way\u201d). Nevertheless, despite the fact that the effect of PD and NPD is not exactly equal at the level of SEF neurons, the neural activity pattern implies that somewhere in the neural circuit leading from the target detection and evaluation to the SEF activity we record there is at least one (possible multiple) steps in which the neurons representing the competing targets exert an inhibitory effect on each other, which embodies a competitive interaction. Of course, based on the existing data we cannot say if this step occurs: 1) upstream of the SEF, 2) locally within the SEF, or 3) whether it occurs at multiple levels within the decision network. The demonstration of direct local inhibition between SEF neurons would require experiments such as the ones performed by the Schlag\u2019s in FEF and SC (Schlag-Rey et al., 1992; Schlag et al., 1998) in which they recorded activity in some oculomotor neuron and demonstrated that activation of a different part of FEF or SC led to decreased activity in the neuron, or optogenetic stimulation experiments (Nassi et al., 2015). However, given the knowledge that inhibition plays an important role in many other cortical areas, including FEF and LIP (Schlag et al., 1998; Falkner et al., 2010), we think the suggestion that this might also be the case in SEF is not far-fetched and certainly would fit with our results."

The inhibition could operate directly between SEF neurons with different PDs (some form of lateral inhibition). Alternatively, a global inhibitory network could be involved as in standard neuronal decision models (Wang, 2002), or as in divisive normalization (Nassi et al., 2015)). The exact mechanism (or mechanisms) must be of course worked out in future experiments. Nevertheless, it seems important to note that all of these mechanisms have the same functional consequence: they generate a situation, in which the incentive to choose one course of action is suppressed by the simultaneously existing incentive to choose alternative actions. Thus, the various action value signals have to compete with each other, which constitutes the essential step in decision-making."

We agree with the reviewer that the mutual inhibition is not a necessary condition for neural signals to participate in the decision process. Our argument is slightly different. The decision process consists of: 1) a representation of the alternatives (e.g. options, actions, or perceptual states), 2) a comparison of the alternatives, and 3) a representation of the chosen alternative. All 3 types of variables are necessary, but they indicate different stages of the decision process. We observe in SEF neuronal signals that match the last stage of the economic goods selection, i.e., a chosen option signal. This is evident in the asymmetric effect of chosen option in the regression analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), but also in the fact that there is almost no increase in mutual information about the non-chosen option (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This is in contrast to action-related signals, which imply that SEF represent the comparison stage and the chosen alternative stage in the case of action selection. Altogether, we would argue this suggests that SEF receives the output of the option selection process that takes place upstream of SEF, but participates in the action selection process. It seems that this interpretation is not too far off the reviewer\u2019s ideas. We agree that our line of reasoning is not completely decisive. In the revised paper, we therefore clarified our reasoning and made sure to indicate clearly that this is only our interpretation of the data (subsection \u201cSEF neurons reflect the value of both choice options in an opposing way\u201d)."

On the other hand, the fact that SEF is part of a larger network and is influenced by the ongoing activity in this network does not preclude an active role of SEF in shaping the dynamic and outcome of this process. Separating and identifying the specific role of all the different nodes in this network is a complex process and will require a number of additional future experiments, but this is true for practically all neurophysiological recordings at the present time."

This is graphically indicated by the absence of inhibitory connections between the nodes representing the reward options (or goods). In this model B, we would expect the chosen direction information to appear simultaneously with or even slightly earlier than the chosen reward option information, since the selected action value signal contains both direction and value information. However, this prediction is contradicted by our observation that the chosen value information is present earlier than the chosen action information (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Thus, there is a moment during the decision-making process (100-50 ms before saccade onset), when the SEF neurons encode which option is chosen, but not yet, what saccade will be chosen. This could clearly never happen in an action selection model of decision-making. On the other hand, we found also evidence for competition between action value-encoding neurons in SEF that is spatially organized, i.e., in an action-based frame of reference (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This fact, together with the fact that we find activity corresponding to both response option (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) clearly rules out the pure good-based model A. The time difference in the onset of chosen option and direction information also argues against strong recurrent connections from the action selection level back to the option selection level, as suggested by the distributed consensus model C. Thus, our data are most consistent with a model that predicts selection both on the option and the action representation level, but with asymmetric connections between them, so that the option selection level influences the action selection level, but not vice versa.

(At least, that is how we understand the question of the reviewer.) We thank the reviewer for bringing up this question, because it forced us to be clearer in the revised manuscript about this aspect of the decision process (subsection \u201cAction value map in SEF reflects competition between available saccade choices\u201d). On choice trials, there is a simultaneous onset of activity in the two areas of the action value map that correspond with the location of the two target options (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Throughout the task, there is a robust representation of both options maintained in SEF, even after the divergence of activity that indicates the chosen option and action (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C, D</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B, C</a>). However, during the initial rise in activity the SEF population does not indicate the value of the target in its PD. At the time, when the neurons start to differentiate their activity according to PD value they also reflect the value of the NPD value. This can be seen very clearly in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> showing the activity of SEF neurons for PD targets of medium value. Depending on the value of the NPD target, the activity starts to change ~110-120 ms after target onset. The activity in this figure is not sorted by saccade choice, but it can be presumed that the monkey chose the PD target, when the NPD target was smaller in value (yellow line) and chose the NPD target, when it was larger in value (red line). However, it took this much time for the SEF neurons to indicate value even during no-choice trials, when there was no competing target. It seems therefore that the SEF neurons always indicate relative action value. There is therefore no time period in which two populations of SEF neurons represent the absolute action value of a target independent of the value of any competing target. Nevertheless, there is clear evidence of a succession of an initial undifferentiated state to a more and more differentiated state in which the chosen action value representation increases in activity and the non-chosen one decreases (again see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Thus, there is clear evidence for a dynamic process as would be expected by a decision mechanism driven by competition via inhibitory interactions."

To avoid confusion in the community, please accept the only valid definition of action value, which comes out of machine learning: the value of an action that is independent of the action being chosen (a decision input variable). To me it looks like you did not find coding of action value of your type 1. Please rephrase your description of the type of value being coded.</i> The reviewer is correct that \u2018action value\u2019 is a term that is often used in the literature with slightly varying meaning and that a consistent use of nomenclature is important for the field. We modified therefore our description of the different types of signals that represent the value associated with particular actions."

We added a new figure (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and some discussion in the paper (subsection \u201cInstantaneous changes in SEF activity state space reflect decision process\u201d) to explain why we did not pooled forced choice trial with other trials. We agree that in many studies, no-choice trials can be considered forced choices in which simply one of the two values is zero and all trials can be pooled. This is a reasonable strategy if neuronal activity in no-choice trials is indeed similar to the one in choice trial. However, there are examples in the literature, where there is an obvious difference. In a human psychophysical experiments that we conducted recently, the reaction time distribution for choice trials with zero alternative value (that is two targets, one of which is associated with no reward) are different from those for no-choice trials (Chen, Mihalas, Niebur and Stuphorn, 2013). Alexandre Pastor-Bernier and Paul Cisek (2011) reported activity differences in the premotor cortex between choice and no-choice trials. In our initial analysis, we therefore separated the choice trials from no-choice trials to avoid overlooking some useful information by combining the two conditions together. It turned out that we did find neuronal activity differences between no-choice and choice trials. In contrast to premotor cortex neurons (Alexandre Pastor-Bernier and Paul Cisek, 2011), SEF neurons did show value tuning in no-choice trial similar to what was shown in choice trials. However, SEF neurons showed higher activity in choice trials than in no-choice trials when the targets in the receptive field (RF) were chosen, and lower activity in choice trials than in no-choice trials when the targets in RF were not chosen (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). Therefore, we could not treat no-choice trials as equivalent to a choice trial in which one of the two values is zero. It is worth pointing out that this is different from the activity pattern observed in LIP (Louie and Glimcher, 2012) that indicate a process of divisive normalization. We will address the difference between no-choice trial and choice trials in detail in a following up manuscript with some descriptive models."

The trajectories show the population neuronal activity when the down-left targets were chosen (the black trajectories in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A, B</a> in the main manuscript). The trajectories are grouped according to both chosen and non-chosen values. The red, orange and blue colors indicate the large (L), medium (M) and small (S) chosen values in choice trials. Solid, dash and dotted lines indicate the small, medium and large non-chosen values. Please note that there are fewer trajectories when the target was less valuable, because it was chosen less often. In comparison, purple, black and green colors indicate the large, medium and small chosen value in no-choice trials. The trajectories for choice trials were influenced by both chosen and non-chosen values. Specifically, given a chosen value (indicating by color), the trajectories were slightly lower along the value axis if the non-chosen value was larger (indicating by line patterns). Accordingly, if no-choice trials simply represent a situation, in which the non-chosen value is 0, the trajectories for no-choice trial should be similar to the ones on choice trials with small non-chosen value. Instead, the trajectories for no-choice trials are very different and reach always a smaller point along both the value and direction axis."
