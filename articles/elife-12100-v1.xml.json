Translocons are generally thought of as channels that allow proteins to cross cell membranes. In eukaryotes, it is thought that newly-formed secreted proteins pass through the Sec61 translocon as they emerge from the ribosome. New membrane proteins are thought to follow a similar path, except that the hydrophobic transmembrane helices in these proteins are diverted sideways so that they become embedded in the cell membrane. This \u2018sequential-insertion\u2019 scheme seems logical in the context of what we know about the structure of translocons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Rapoport et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Cymer et al., 2015</a>), but is it correct?"

The alternative is to simulate the process. However, a newly-formed protein chain elongates at a rate of about one residue every 50\u2013100 milliseconds, which is orders of magnitude faster than can be modeled using standard molecular dynamics simulation methods. Now, in eLife, Reid van Lehn, Bin Zhang and Thomas Miller of the California Institute of Technology report a simplified approach that allows insertion and folding to be simulated on biological time scales (<a href=\"#bib8\">Van Lehn et al., 2015</a>). Their results suggest that the membrane protein insertion/folding process is more complicated than commonly depicted in the sequential-insertion scheme."

The interhelical loops in red represent the loops that flip most slowly, and thereby have a major influence on the kinetics of folding. EmrE can take on two different, antiparallel topologies; each row in the figure shows how one of these topologies may develop. (<b>B</b>) Van Lehn et al. used a coarse-grained model to simulate the insertion and folding of the EmrE dual-topology membrane protein (<a href=\"#bib11\">Zhang and Miller, 2012</a>). Coarse-grained beads are assigned approximate hydrophobicity values (indicated by the shadings of the beads). The ribosome (brown) and translocon (green) are also represented as coarse-grained beads. The translocon is negatively charged on the cytoplasmic end and positively charged at the periplasmic end to represent the known charge distribution of the Sec 61 translocon (<a href=\"#bib3\">Goder et al., 2004</a>). The simulation proceeds by adding a bead at the C-terminus of the nascent chain every 125 milliseconds; the panel on the right shows the chain on the left at a later point in time.

This rule suggests that if the connecting loops that join the transmembrane regions of the protein are rich in lysine and arginine residues, then these loops tend to orient inward, toward the cytoplasm of the cell. This is known as the K+R bias. EmrE, which is encoded in a single gene, has a weak K+R bias, and this means that the monomers can be inserted into the membrane in one of two opposite orientations (<a href=\"#bib5\">Rapp et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2007</a>)."

Given the positive-inside rule and the sequential-insertion scheme, one would expect positive charges in the C-terminal region of a membrane protein to have a smaller influence on topology than charges in the N-terminal region.

The simulations now performed by Van Lehn et al. divulge the missing ingredients of membrane protein folding: stochastic insertion and post-insertion annealing. By stochastic insertion, I mean that protein chains can have various topologies after they have been made, creating what Van Lehn et al. refer to as an \u2018end-of-translation ensemble\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). After being inserted into the membrane, the members of the ensemble that are not initially in their lowest thermodynamic free energy state subsequently relax to their preferred topology through a process called annealing. In the case of EmrE, antiparallel dimers can form because there are two final topologies that have similar free energies."

Four beads were used to represent the transmembrane helices and five beads were to used represent the loops that connect these helices. Certain properties of the amino acid residues that are known to affect the topology of a protein were also incorporated into the simulation: for example, hydrophobicities were assigned to the beads using an experimentally-determined hydrophobicity scale (<a href=\"#bib10\">Wimley et al., 1996</a>). Particularly important was the assignment of positive charges in the connecting loops between the transmembrane helices to mimic the mutation experiments of <a href=\"#bib7\">Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al<i>.</i> (2010)</a>. The ribosome and translocon were also represented by simple two-dimensional structures composed of coarse-grained beads (<a href=\"#bib11\">Zhang and Miller, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).
