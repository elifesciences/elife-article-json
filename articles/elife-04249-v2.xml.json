The canonical function of connexins is to form gap junctions in which two hexameric connexons, or hemichannels, in closely apposed membranes dock together to form an intercellular channel. However connexins can also function as hemichannels, thereby providing large conductance channels, which allow passage of small molecules such as ATP into the extracellular space (<a href=\"#bib19\">Stout et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). We have recently shown that Cx26 hemichannels are directly sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Huckstepp et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Meigh et al., 2013</a>). When CO<sub>2</sub> binds to Cx26, it carbamylates K125, forms a salt bridge to R104 and opens the hemichannel (<a href=\"#bib15\">Meigh et al., 2013</a>). Cx26 hemichannels are thus a source of CO<sub>2</sub>-gated ATP release (<a href=\"#bib9\">Huckstepp et al., 2010a</a>)."

Some of these mutations cause loss of functional protein, while other mutations result in gap junctions and hemichannels with altered properties. However the effect of these mutations on the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx26 has never been examined. Some missense mutations of Cx26 cause serious pathologies in humans, such as the very rare ectodermal disorder, Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness (KID) syndrome. KID syndrome involves a combination of deafness, visual impairment, and dermatological abnormalities (<a href=\"#bib2\">Caceres-Rios et al., 1996</a>). About 100 cases have been reported in the literature, and of these around 70% are caused by de novo mutations in Cx26, with the remainder being inherited in an autosomal dominant manner or via germ line mosaicism (<a href=\"#bib18\">Sbidian et al., 2010</a>). To date there are nine missense mutations that can cause KID syndrome (<a href=\"#bib22\">Xu and Nicholson, 2013</a>). The severity of the symptoms of KID syndrome depends on the particular mutation in Cx26 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Janecke et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Jonard et al., 2008</a>)."

In one of the original reports linking Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> to KID syndrome, the patient required mechanical ventilation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Koppelhus et al., 2010</a>), suggesting a possible effect of the mutation on the neural control of breathing. In KID syndrome caused by a different missense mutation (G45E), which is fatal within the first year of life, there are also reports of breathing problems. One patient required mechanical ventilation immediately after birth (<a href=\"#bib11\">Janecke et al., 2005</a>) and a second died from breathing failure (<a href=\"#bib18\">Sbidian et al., 2010</a>). Nevertheless, without detailed recordings of cardiorespiratory activity, it is not possible to know whether these patients experienced inadequate central respiratory drive. For other mutations linked to KID syndrome there are no reports of abnormal breathing in the literature."

Expression of Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> in HeLa cells gives rise to enhanced hemichannel-mediated currents (compared to wild type Cx26, Cx26<sup>WT</sup>) at positive transmembrane potentials and in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, leading to the suggestion that this mutation represents a gain of function (<a href=\"#bib16\">Mhaske et al., 2013</a>). The G45E mutation, also causes enhanced hemichannel activity in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and increased permeability to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gerido et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Sanchez et al., 2010</a>). A gain of function has therefore been suggested as underlying the actions of this mutation too. Although the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> opens connexin hemichannels, this condition is unlikely to occur in physiological systems. Thus the consequences of the A88V and G45E mutations on physiologically relevant gating of Cx26 remain unclear."

This respiratory pattern is abnormal for the age of the infant and is suggestive of blunted chemosensory control of breathing.

We transfected HeLa cells that stably expressed Cx26<sup>WT</sup> with the Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> subunit and documented their sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> following transfection. 4 days after transfection with Cx26<sup>A88V</sup>, the HeLa cells still exhibited sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), but this was reduced compared to the Cx26<sup>WT</sup> HeLa cells that had not been transfected with Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). 5 and 6 days after transfection, the HeLa cells showed no sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Nevertheless functional hemichannels were still present as the removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> caused dye loading (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The loss of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity was not simply a consequence of days in culture, as Cx26<sup>WT</sup> HeLa cells that had not been transfected with Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> retained their sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> over the whole period examined (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We therefore conclude that Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> subunits are able to act in a dominant negative manner to cause loss of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity from wild type Cx26 hemichannels."

In the closely related \u03b2 connexin, connexin30 (Cx30), the mutation A88V connected to Clouston's Syndrome (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bosen et al., 2014</a>), may result in constitutively open Cx30 hemichannels (<a href=\"#bib6\">Essenfelder et al., 2004</a>).

However under physiological conditions of normal extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and in the presence of physiological CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> buffering, we suggest that A88V should be considered as a loss-of-function mutation that effectively removes the capacity for CO<sub>2</sub>-evoked ATP release via Cx26 hemichannels."

Although we do not know if the loss of CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity in Cx26 contributed to the aberrant respiratory drive exhibited by this patient, these results are consistent with this possibility, and represent the first evidence to suggest that Cx26 hemichannels are a requisite component of the drive to breathe in humans. Overall the ability of physiological levels of PCO<sub>2</sub> to permit ATP release via Cx26 hemichannels may be important in the epidermis, cochlea and brain. Investigation of whether the absence of this mechanism of ATP release in patients with Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> contributes to the serious pathological abnormalities that they suffer would seem to be warranted."

Using ImageJ, the extent of dye loading was measured by drawing a region of interest (ROI) around individual cells and calculating the mean pixel intensity for the ROI. The mean pixel intensity of the background fluorescence was also measured in a representative ROI, and this value was subtracted from the measures obtained from the cells. All of the images displayed in the figures reflect this procedure in that the mean intensity of the pixels in a representative background ROI has been subtracted from every pixel of the image. The analysis of the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of Cx26<sup>A88V</sup> was performed as five independent repetitions in which at least 40 cells were measured in each condition, and the mean pixel intensities plotted as cumulative probability distributions."

This is a complex area as different mutations in Cx26 give forms of the syndrome that differ in their severity. The mutation A88V causes a highly severe form that is fatal in early childhood. In the first report linking A88V to KID syndrome, a requirement for mechanical ventilation was noted; a second report on A88V did not note any respiratory problems. A different mutation, G45E, also caused a severe form of KID syndrome, which was fatal in the first year of life. There are two reports of abnormal breathing in these patients. However no detailed cardiorespiratory recordings were presented in these prior descriptions of KID syndrome, and thus we cannot assess whether the abnormalities in breathing resulted from a loss of central respiratory drive."
