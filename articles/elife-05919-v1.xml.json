These compounds have also been found in marine fish, where their accumulation is thought to be of dietary or symbiont origin. In this study, we report the unexpected discovery that fish can synthesize gadusol de novo and that the analogous pathways are also present in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that engineered yeast containing the fish genes can produce and secrete gadusol. The discovery of the gadusol pathway in vertebrates provides a platform for understanding its role in these animals, and the possibility of engineering yeast to efficiently produce a natural sunscreen and antioxidant presents an avenue for its large-scale production for possible use in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics."

These compounds have also been found in marine fish, where their accumulation is thought to be of dietary or symbiont origin. In this study, we report the unexpected discovery that fish can synthesize gadusol de novo and that the analogous pathways are also present in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that engineered yeast containing the fish genes can produce and secrete gadusol. The discovery of the gadusol pathway in vertebrates provides a platform for understanding its role in these animals, and the possibility of engineering yeast to efficiently produce a natural sunscreen and antioxidant presents an avenue for its large-scale production for possible use in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics."

This opens up a new area of study, because besides providing UV protection, no one yet knows what other roles the molecule may have in these animals. Furthermore, introducing the complete pathway into yeast enabled these cells to produce the sunscreen. In the future, engineering a yeast population to produce large quantities of the natural sunscreen could lead to large-scale production of the UV-protective compound so it can be used in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics."

Although their formation had long been proposed to originate from the shikimate pathway, more recent bioinformatic and biochemical studies revealed that in cyanobacteria, MAAs are synthesized by desmethyl-4-deoxygadusol synthase (DDGS), a dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS) homolog (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Balskus and Walsh, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Singh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Asamizu et al., 2012</a>).

DDGS converts sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (SH7P) to desmethyl-4-deoxygadusol via a unique sequence of dephosphorylation, aldol condensation, enolization, dehydration, reduction, and tautomerization reactions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Balskus and Walsh, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Asamizu et al., 2012</a>).

Whereas humans and other mammals also have FRMD4B, MitF, MDFIC, and FoxP1 homologs, they lack the EEVS-like and the MT-Ox genes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Therefore, the presence of the EEVS-like gene, previously only found in bacteria, in the genomes of fish, and other egg-laying vertebrates is puzzling and evolutionarily intriguing. Here, we report bioinformatics and functional studies of zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) EEVS-like and MT-Ox genes and the expression of this two-enzyme pathway in yeast, and discuss the evolutionary origin of this pathway in fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds."

Incubation of the recombinant protein with SH7P gave a product, which was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and GC-MS to be EEV (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 3, 4</a>), identifying the protein as an EEVS. The best-characterized bacterial EEVS is ValA from the validamycin pathway in <i>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</i> subsp. <i>jinggangensis</i> 5008 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bai et al., 2006</a>), and the crystal structure of ValA (Protein Data Bank [PDB] entry 4P53) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kean et al., 2014</a>), allowed identification of a fingerprint set of 14 active-site residues with characteristic variations that could differentiate the various SH7P cyclases. Further supporting the assignment of the LOC100003999-encoded protein as an EEVS, sequence comparisons show that all animal EEVS-like proteins are highly similar (60\u201372% identity) and also match the sequence of ValA at all 14 fingerprint sites (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 5, 6</a>). This firmly establishes the presence of EEVS activity in animals."

                        "text": "The second gene, MT-Ox (zgc:113054), is predicted to encode a protein that contains two domains: the <i>N</i>-terminal domain is similar to <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine (SAM)\u2013dependent methyltransferases, and the <i>C</i>-terminal domain is similar to NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent oxidoreductases. Although its function in zebrafish is unknown, the transcription of this gene in larvae is upregulated by light, leading to a prediction of its involvement in circadian clock regulation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Weger et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, we hypothesized that this bifunctional protein is involved in modifying EEV to yield an oxidized and methylated product (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To test this hypothesis, recombinant MT-Ox protein encoded by zgc:113054 was incubated with EEV in the presence of SAM and NAD<sup>+</sup>. Following incubation, a product with \u03bbmax of 294 nm (pH 7) and 270 (pH 2.5) was detected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013B</a>). Further analysis of the product by (\u2212)-ESI-MS (<i>m/z</i> 203 [M-H]<sup>\u2212</sup>) and <sup>1</sup>H NMR confirmed its identity as gadusol (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). We postulate that the conversion of EEV to gadusol by MT-Ox takes place via oxidation of the C-2 or C-3 OH, followed by enolization and methylation of the resulting C-2 OH (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This new pathway to the UV-absorbing vinylogous acid functional group shared by gadusol and 4-deoxygadusol is distinct from that used in the biosynthesis of the MAAs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Balskus and Walsh, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Spence et al., 2012</a>), and the existence of multiple pathways for generating this scaffold is intriguing and may indicate that this is a privileged chemical scaffold in living organisms."

To demonstrate de novo synthesis of gadusol in zebrafish, the embryos were collected at 72 hpf, lyophilized and extracted with methanol, and the extract was analyzed by HPLC and ESI-MS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Our finding of gadusol in the extract unambiguously confirms the ability of zebrafish to synthesize gadusol and amends the current perception that gadusol found in fish and other vertebrates is necessarily of dietary or symbiont origin. However, as MAAs are synthesized via a different pathway and there is no evidence that fish have those biosynthetic enzymes, the accumulation of MAAs in fish would still appear to be of dietary origin (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mason et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Zamzow, 2004</a>)."

Yeast possesses a robust pentose\u2013phosphate pathway (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), and by removing the transaldolase enzyme, which normally metabolizes SH7P, and adding EEVS and MT-Ox, we expected to facilitate an effective shunt pathway from SH7P to gadusol.

We suggest that the vertebrate EEVS and MT-Ox genes were most plausibly acquired via horizontal gene transfer. Interestingly, searches identify the stramenopile <i>Aureococcus anophagefferens</i> and the microalgae <i>Coccomyxa subellipsoidea</i>, as the only non-vertebrate organisms in current databases that harbor a similar bifunctional MT-Ox gene, and both organisms have a predicted EEVS gene adjacent to that of MT-Ox. As algae are known to be active horizontal gene transfer agents (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ni et al., 2012</a>), algae such as these become a plausible place both for the development of this alternate pathway for gadusol production and as a source of the genes found in vertebrates. Further supporting such a relationship, the <i>A. anophagefferens</i> EEVS protein is substantially more similar to the vertebrate EEVSs than it is to bacterial EEVSs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, denoted by the blue star)."

While the EEVS and MT-Ox genes are retained in modern ray-finned fish (with the exception of puffer fish), as well as in amphibians, reptiles, and birds, they were lost in mammals, including the egg-laying mammal platypus, indicating the lack of a direct link between gadusol and the mode of reproduction. The West African coelacanth genome (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amemiya et al., 2013</a>) also appears to lack the EEVS and MT-Ox genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This rare ovoviviparous fish lives in caves 100\u2013500 meters deep and feeds at night, and its lack of gadusol production ability may be directly related to its limited exposure to UV light and/or oxidative stress. Other than the well-documented presence of gadusol in fish eggs, where it can serve to protect the roe from UV damage (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arbeloa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Colleter et al., 2014</a>), nothing is known of its role(s) in fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds. Exploring its function in these organisms will increase our understanding of their physiology and ecology."

They also show that the two genes are expressed in zebrafish and that gadusol can be isolated from zebrafish embryos. The authors introduced both genes into an engineered strain of yeast that accumulates the EEVS substrate sedoheptulose-7-phosphate and demonstrate the production of gadusol. Finally, they show that extracts from gadusol-producing yeast protect both wild-type and mutant yeast strains from UV-B radiation. Collectively, these data provide strong support that vertebrates can make these compounds and that they need not be produced by symbionts or obtained in diet. Overall, the biochemical data is very convincing, with some questions raised by the reviewers. The bioinformatics/evolution data was considered less robust and needs strengthening. Results from the phylogenetic analyses suggest a series of repeated transfers between bacterial and eukaryotic homologs that appear to be an interesting part of the story. Yet, the methods listed are not sufficient to make this claim. Below are several ways to validate/improve these phylogenetic results. The reviewers agree that the requested revisions should be doable."

As suggested, Bayesian analysis was performed by MrBayes (version 3.2.3), using a random starting tree, running eight chains for 4,000,000 generations, sampling every 250 trees. The first 5,000 trees were discarded as the burnin, with the remaining trees used to calculate posterior probability. RAxML and MrBayes were run on the CIPRES science gateway. The Bayesian phylogenetic tree is presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, whereas the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree is presented in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2</a>. The results are fully consistent with the previous ones, and even place both algal EEVS sequences closer to the vertebrate sequences, further strengthening our horizontal gene transfer proposal."
