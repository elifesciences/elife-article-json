We uncovered cellular features exhibiting signature changes at thermal limits in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> embryos. These included changes in embryo size and shape, which were also observed in <i>Caenorhabditis briggsae</i>, indicating evolutionary conservation. We hypothesized that such changes could reflect restricted aerobic capacity at thermal limits. Accordingly, we uncovered that relative respiration in <i>C. elegans</i> embryos decreases at the thermal limits as compared to within the thermal range. Furthermore, by compromising components of the respiratory chain, we demonstrated that the reliance on aerobic metabolism is reduced at thermal limits. Moreover, embryos thus compromised exhibited signature changes in size and shape already within the thermal range. We conclude that restricted aerobic metabolism at the thermal limits contributes to setting the thermal range in a metazoan organism."

For example, the embryos were larger than normal when grown at the lower end of their temperature ranges, but were smaller when grown at temperatures close to their upper limit. Shape changes were also seen: the embryos of both species were longer when grown at higher temperatures, a change that increases their surface area relative to their volume and may improve their ability to take up oxygen. Further experiments showed that disrupting respiration in the worms could lead to similar size and shape changes within the thermal range."

This hypothesis, referred to as the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT), derives in part from the observation that oxygen partial pressure in aquatic organisms is constant within a given thermal range and decreases both below the lower thermal limit and above the upper thermal limit (<a href=\"#bib27\">P\u00f6rtner, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">P\u00f6rtner et al., 2006</a>). In agreement with this hypothesis, the metabolic status of some aquatic organisms has been shown to peak at a given temperature and to decrease both below and above that (<a href=\"#bib25\">Melzner et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Wittmann et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly too, tolerance to high temperatures is increased in an amphibian crab when the animal is in the air compared to when it is in water, reflecting the reduced cost of oxygen supply in air (<a href=\"#bib19\">Giomi et al., 2014</a>), again supporting the OCLTT hypothesis. Overall, these data suggest that thermal limits in complex organisms are characterized by a mismatch in oxygen supply and demand, which would result in reduced energy production and thus limit reproduction and growth (<a href=\"#bib27\">P\u00f6rtner, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">P\u00f6rtner et al., 2006</a>)."

One possible solution is suggested by the observation that body size decreases with augmented temperature in the vast majority of ectotherms (\u2018temperature-size rule\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Atkinson, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Forster et al., 2012</a>), thereby increasing surface to volume ratio and thus potentially oxygen availability. In support of this, the slope of this \u2018temperature-size rule\u2019 is steeper for aquatic organisms than terrestrial organisms, in agreement with the lower availability of oxygen in water compared to air (<a href=\"#bib17\">Forster et al., 2012</a>). This has led to the suggestion that alterations in cell size in response to changes in temperature within the thermal range are adaptive responses to preserve aerobic capacity, which has been dubbed the MASROS hypothesis (<span class=\"underline\">M</span>aintain <span class=\"underline\">A</span>erobic <span class=\"underline\">S</span>cope\u2014<span class=\"underline\">R</span>egulate <span class=\"underline\">O</span>xygen <span class=\"underline\">S</span>upply) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Atkinson et al., 2006</a>). What happens beyond the thermal limits within this conceptual framework? One might expect that thermal limits could be characterized by further changes in cell size and potentially also cell shape, in an attempt to increase the available surface area and thus maximize oxygen availability. Furthermore, the MASROS hypothesis predicts that aerobic metabolism, measured as respiration, should decrease beyond both the lower and the upper thermal limit as compared to within the thermal range, once the organism can no longer compensate for the insufficient oxygen availability. To our knowledge, these central predictions of the MASROS hypothesis have not been challenged experimentally in an integrative fashion. Therefore, the extent to which restricted aerobic metabolism is a general principle characterizing thermal limits remains unclear."

Using temperature-controlled time-lapse DIC (Differential Interference Contrast) microscopy and semi-automated quantifications of the resulting movies with in-house scripts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013J</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Source code 1</a>), we measured 35 cellular features that describe the main events of the first cell cycle of <i>C. elegans</i> embryos (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013F</a>). In brief, after fertilization, the female pronucleus migrates towards the male pronucleus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). After their meeting, the pronuclei move to the embryo center whilst undergoing a 90\u00b0C rotation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The nuclear envelopes then break down, followed by assembly of the mitotic spindle, which moves slightly to the posterior during the remainder of mitosis whilst oscillating perpendicular to the anterior\u2013posterior axis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This results in the asymmetric division of the one-cell stage embryo into a larger anterior cell and a smaller posterior one (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Our analysis established that the vast majority of the monitored features were temperature-dependent within the thermal range (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Interestingly, some features, including the fraction of time spent in mitosis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and cell division asymmetry (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), exhibited a temperature-independent behavior, suggesting that temperature-compensation mechanisms are also at play."

Thus, the duration of mitosis, which decreased monotonically with increasing temperatures within the thermal range, plateaued beyond both lower and upper thermal limits in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Moreover, although <i>C. briggsae</i> can develop at warmer temperatures than <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Prasad et al., 2011</a>), we found that cell cycle duration was not faster in <i>C. briggsae</i> than in <i>C. elegans</i> at any temperature (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, compare with <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

In <i>C. briggsae</i>, by contrast, the data beyond 25\u00b0C reduced the explained variance from 86% to 39%, suggesting that cell cycle duration plateaued already below the upper thermal limit in this species, underscoring the fact that mitosis duration is a limit-sensitive feature."

                                "text": "One possibility to interpret these data is that the energetic needs of the embryo are not satisfied beyond the thermal limits due to insufficient aerobic metabolism. Another possibility is that these needs are actually fulfilled to some extent despite reduced respiration, either because other metabolic routes are used to a larger relative extent or because embryos are metabolically depressed at the thermal limits and thus require less energy altogether. We reasoned that if aerobic metabolism became insufficient beyond the thermal limits, then further compromising mitochondrial activity should have more of an impact at the thermal limits than within the thermal range. By contrast, if energetic needs could be fulfilled at the least to some extent despite reduced respiration beyond the thermal limits, then further compromising mitochondrial activity should have less of an impact at the thermal limits than within the thermal range. Therefore, to distinguish between these two possibilities, we depleted three components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain using RNAi: the beta-subunit of ATP synthase ATP-2 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tsang et al., 2001</a>), a complex V component, the subunit of the mitochondrial complex I NUO-1 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tsang et al., 2001</a>), and the component of the mitochondrial complex III CYC-1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dillin et al., 2002</a>). We ascertained that embryonic respiration was reduced in <i>cyc-1(RNAi)</i> embryos, reaching on average 56% \u00b1 13% of the wild-type levels under the assay conditions (t-test p-value &lt; 10<sup>\u22123</sup>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Since ATP-2 and NUO-1 are part of complex V and I, respectively, respiration may still occur upon their depletion, even if the mitochondrial respiratory chain is compromised (<a href=\"#bib12\">Braeckman et al., 2009</a>), so that respiration measurements may not have been telling in these cases. Importantly, we found that all three RNAi conditions were embryonic lethal to some extent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>), probably owing to decreased energy production through respiration, although we cannot exclude that the observed lethality stems from changes in pH or increased reactive oxygen species. Importantly, in addition, this analysis uncovered that embryonic lethality was reduced towards the lower thermal limit as compared to within the thermal range in all three cases, as well as towards the upper thermal limit in both <i>cyc-1(RNAi)</i> and <i>nuo-1(RNAi)</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>). These results offer strong experimental support to the notion that the capacity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is restricted beyond both thermal limits, and raise the possibility that other metabolic routes are used to a larger relative extent at those temperatures in the face of reduced respiration."

We reasoned that if this were the case, then such changes should occur already within the thermal range of embryos in which components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are compromised. Interestingly, we found that whereas embryo size was not significantly affected upon RNAi-mediated depletion of <i>atp-2</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), these embryos were more elongated at both 12\u00b0C and 16\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, U-test p(12\u00b0C) = 0.0034, p(16\u00b0C) = 0.0039). In <i>nuo-1(RNAi)</i>, embryo size was significantly reduced at both temperatures (U-test p(12\u00b0C) = 0.02, U-test p(16\u00b0C) &lt; 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), whereas a similar response was observed in <i>cyc-1(RNAi)</i> embryos at 12\u00b0C (U-test p(12\u00b0C) &lt; 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). While it remains to be investigated why the cellular consequences of depleting these three components differ to some extent, remarkably, they share the net result of increasing surface to volume ratio within the thermal range, thus mimicking the situation in the wild-type beyond the thermal limits. Therefore, these results strongly support the notion that the uncovered cellular hallmarks observed at the thermal limits of wild-type embryos reflect restricted aerobic capacity."

Interestingly, we uncovered that the thermal response of select cellular features changed precisely at the limit temperatures defined by embryonic viability tests (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>). While we do not know whether these cellular hallmarks are responsible for the observed increased lethality beyond the thermal limits, we note that a mere 10% decrease in embryonic viability is associated with readily observable cellular changes during the first cell cycle. Importantly, experiments in which mitochondrial respiration is compromised revealed that aerobic metabolism plays a smaller relative role towards the thermal limits than within the thermal range, raising the possibility that other metabolic routes are favored to produce energy. Furthermore, these experiments uncover that the changes in size and shape observed beyond the thermal limits in the wild-type can be recapitulated within the thermal range by impairing aerobic metabolism, strongly supporting the view that these changes arise in response to restricted aerobic metabolism. Together, our work provides critical experimental evidence supporting the notion that restricted aerobic metabolism is a general principle characterizing thermal limits in multicellular organisms in water and on land. Other elements contribute to setting boundary conditions within which a thermal range can be envisaged. Thus, cold-induced increase in unsaturated fatty acids in cyanobacteria, <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hazel, 1995</a>) and <i>C. elegans</i> contributes to setting the lower thermal limit (<a href=\"#bib34\">Svensk et al., 2013</a>), although it only accounts for 16% of the observed difference in cold tolerance at 10\u00b0C vs 25\u00b0C in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Murray et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, warm-induced increase in post-translational glycosylation also contributes to setting the upper thermal limit in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, <i>Danio rerio</i> and <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Radermacher et al., 2014</a>). In addition, defects in synaptonemal complex assembly (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bilgir et al., 2013</a>) and in sperm (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harvey and Viney, 2007</a>) contribute to setting the upper organismal limit in <i>C. elegans</i>. The restricted aerobic metabolism experimentally uncovered here is another important piece of the puzzle that contributes to defining both thermal limits."

Embryos were dissected in 1\u00d7 M9 medium tempered at the culture temperature, mounted on slides, placed under a coverslip and imaged using time-lapse DIC microscopy. Considering the crowded compressive environment of the uterus in the intact animal, and considering furthermore that the same mounting procedure was followed for all specimens at all temperatures, we surmise that the observed alterations in thermal response of embryo size and shape at given temperatures are not due to the mounting procedure. However, we cannot totally exclude that the observed changes in embryo size and shape may result from differential resilience to pressure of the cover slip used for imaging at the various temperatures."

Note that these filters did not change the dominant frequency of the signal, but were useful to better detect the peaks and measure the amplitude of the oscillations. Since the oscillations envelope was not always well fit by a sinusoidal function, we determined the duration of the oscillations by manual inspection of the oscillations profile (after filtering)."

After 44 hr at 20\u00b0C, embryos were collected in both control and <i>cyc-1(RNAi)</i> conditions by bleaching adult worms. Respiration was measured in two chambers as follows: after calibrating the machine with 1\u00d7 M9 buffer at 20\u00b0C, 35,000 wild-type embryos were dispensed in each chamber and their respiration measured at that temperature. The chamber was then washed, and we dispensed 35,000 embryos from the <i>cyc-1(RNAi)</i> condition and likewise measured their respiration. For each chamber, we compared the respiration of <i>cyc-1(RNAi)</i> embryos over wild-type. The experiment was repeated once using 35,000 embryos in the four chambers. Note that the lethality incurred following <i>cyc-1</i>(<i>RNAi</i>) in these experiments was less pronounced than that reported in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, probably owing to the need to scale up to assess respiration in a large number of embryos, such that the reported diminution of respiration is likely an underestimate of the actual impact."

The authors examine 35 features of 1-cell zygotes in response to temperature and identify those features that behave differently at the animals' thermal limits. In particular, they find that embryos tend to increase their surface to volume ratio at the thermal limits. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that changes in aerobic capacity underlie thermal stress. Consistent with this hypothesis, the authors found that depleting key metabolic enzymes also causes an increase in surface-to-volume ratio. Based on this correlation, the authors conclude that \u201caerobic metabolism is limiting at both lower and upper thermal limits\u201d."

For example, do embryos depleted for key aerobic metabolism enzymes become hypersensitive to temperature changes? Without additional experiments that test the hypothesis directly, the data are too preliminary."

The cited papers by P\u00f6rtner and colleagues refer to what is called the concept of oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT, cf. P\u00f6rtner 2010 J. exp Biol.). The earliest limit is a loss in performance caused by a mismatch in oxygen supply capacity and associated costs as well as hypoxemia constraining performance capacity, leaving less energy for e.g. growth (P\u00f6rtner and Knust, 2007, Science). So thermal limits then lead to the onset of anaerobic metabolism. These findings have recently been set into perspective across organism domains (Storch et al., 2014, Global Change Biology), which should caution authors with respect to some of their statements on prokaryotes and get their rationale into clearer shape."

Statistical analyses for the new data appear lacking and the experimental design requires more explanation. The authors show that embryos at the thermal limit are less sensitive to depletion of mitochondrial activity by RNAi, than animals in the thermal range. At the upper limit of the thermal range, the data show that RNAi depletion of two mitochondrial enzymes (but curiously not a third one) has no effect on viability. There are no controls to show that the RNAi depletion works equally well at all temperatures and for all three genes, so it is possible that this odd behavior is due to incomplete depletion at different temperatures and/or for different genes. In addition, the logic used to interpret these experiments is not clear. It would seem that if respiration becomes limiting at the thermal limit, then embryos near the limit should become more sensitive, not less, to depletion of respiratory components. In this line of reasoning, the new data would suggest that, in fact, respiration is not the rate limiting step at the thermal limit."

At the upper limit of the thermal range, the data show that RNAi depletion of two mitochondrial enzymes (but curiously not a third one) has no effect on viability. There are no controls to show that the RNAi depletion works equally well at all temperatures and for all three genes, so it is possible that this odd behavior is due to incomplete depletion at different temperatures and/or for different genes.</i>"

As we show below (see panel A), we found that <i>air-1(RNAi)</i> was 100% embryonic lethal at 12\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C and 24\u00b0C, as anticipated from previous work (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hannak et al. 2001</a>). In order to titrate the phenotype, we performed double RNAi by mixing bacteria expressing dsRNA against <i>air-1</i> with bacteria expressing dsRNA against <i>gfp</i> in a 1:3 ratio. Importantly, we found in this case that lethality was greater at 12\u00b0C and at 24\u00b0C than at 20\u00b0C (see panel B). Hence, the RNAi phenotype is actually stronger for <i>air-1</i> towards the lower and the upper thermal limit than at 20\u00b0C, indicating that the results we uncovered when targeting mitochondrial respiratory chain components (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B-D</a> of the manuscript) are not due to a general temperature-dependent response of RNAi. These results are shown in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2</a> and reported in the Materials and methods section."
