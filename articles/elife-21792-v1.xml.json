The generalized eigendecomposition-based cross-frequency coupling framework (gedCFC) is inspired by source-separation algorithms combined with dynamics of mesoscopic neurophysiological processes. It is unaffected by factors that confound traditional CFC methods\u2014such as non-stationarities, non-sinusoidality, and non-uniform phase angle distributions\u2014attractive properties considering that brain activity is neither stationary nor perfectly sinusoidal. The gedCFC framework opens new opportunities for conceptualizing CFC as network interactions with diverse spatial/topographical distributions. Five specific methods within the gedCFC framework are detailed, these are validated in simulated data and applied in several empirical datasets. gedCFC accurately recovers physiologically plausible CFC patterns embedded in noise that causes traditional CFC methods to perform poorly. The paper also demonstrates that spike-field coherence in multichannel local field potential data can be analyzed using the gedCFC framework, which provides significant advantages over traditional spike-field coherence analyses. Null-hypothesis testing is also discussed."

A core idea that permeates CFC theories is that the phase of a slower brain rhythm coordinates a temporal sequence of faster processes that represent specific items in memory or in sensory space. There are several manifestations of CFC (<a href=\"#bib6\">Canolty and Knight, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hyafil et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jensen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jirsa and M\u00fcller, 2013</a>), and the most widely used CFC analysis methods involve the application of Euler\u2019s formula, phase synchronization, or distribution analyses, with the goal of determining whether high-frequency power values are non-uniformly distributed over low-frequency phase (<a href=\"#bib61\">Tort et al., 2010</a>)."

The non-sinusoidal waveform shape of neural oscillations may provide important insights into underlying biophysical processes, and yet, for CFC analyses, the non-sinusoidal waveform shapes are potential confounds that must be avoided or corrected. Therefore, analysis methods that do not assume sinusoidality are important 1)\u00a0for\u00a0methodological reasons\u00a0to examine CFC in a wider range of datasets\u00a0and 2)\u00a0for theoretical reasons\u00a0to facilitate discovery of CFC regardless of waveform shape (or explicitly incorporating waveform shape), which is an important step towards uncovering the neurobiological origins and functional significances of neural oscillations."

Furthermore, because volume conduction carries activity from a single neuroelectric source to multiple electrodes, incorporating weighted averages from multiple electrodes can boost signal-to-noise ratio and help in\u00a0isolating patterns of activity (<a href=\"#bib50\">Parra et al., 2005</a>), including in CFC analyses (<a href=\"#bib5\">Canolty et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Soto et al., 2016</a>). This is particularly relevant for noninvasive recordings, in which high-frequency activity can have low power and can be contaminated by muscle artifacts. Finally, multichannel recordings allow the application of advanced matrix analysis methods, including dimensionality-reduction and source separation algorithms, which can identify spatiotemporal patterns of activity that might be difficult to uncover when considering activity from a single electrode at a time (<a href=\"#bib25\">Grootswagers et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Orekhova et al., 2011</a>)."

Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that spike-field coherence in multichannel datasets can be conceptualized as a special case of CFC, permitting the application of gedCFC in this context.

Therefore, this simulation was repeated, replacing the theta sine wave with repeated Gaussians or van der Pol oscillators at theta frequency (these two waveforms are known to produce spurious phase-amplitude coupling). gedCFC was completely robust to these non-sinusoidal time series, in that (1) the simulated pattern of CFC was accurately recovered regardless of non-stationarities or a non-sinusoidal shape of the lower frequency rhythm, and (2) when gamma oscillations were not amplitude-modulated by the lower frequency rhythm, no spurious CFC was identified.

The first step was to identify an alpha component by comparing covariance matrices from data filtered in the alpha range (peak\u00a011 Hz; FWHM\u00a05 Hz; these parameters were selected on the basis of visual inspection of power spectra from posterior sensors). There were several physiologically plausible alpha components, as expected on the basis of previous work (<a href=\"#bib26\">Haegens et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">van der Meij et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Walsh, 1958</a>). The alpha component with the largest eigenvalue was selected for subsequent analyses; it is possible that additional cross-frequency coupling dynamics could emerge when examining other alpha components. A covariance matrix of broadband data was constructed around alpha peaks (only peaks corresponding to\u00a0&gt;1 standard deviation above the mean alpha peak amplitudes were included; this limits the analysis to periods of high alpha power) and compared against the broadband covariance from the entire resting period. The three gedCFC components with the largest eigenvalues were selected for analysis and visualization. Results show that, in this dataset, bursts of broadband and high-frequency activity were time-locked to alpha phase, ranging up to 150 Hz for components 2 and 3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), which appears consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib48\">Osipova et al., 2008</a>).

A brief overview is provided here and depicted in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; interested readers are directed to the 2014 paper for more details. The first step is to extract the time series of a low-frequency component, as was done in Methods 1 and 2, to be used as a bias filter. The next step is to narrowband filter the multichannel data and extract the amplitude envelope (e.g., from filter-Hilbert or from Morlet wavelet convolution). This is an important step: the goal is to identify <i>power</i> fluctuations that vary according to the lower-frequency phase; therefore, it is the high-frequency power time series, not the bandpass filtered signal, that is of primary interest. The next step is to sphere the multichannel power fluctuations, which is implemented by scaling their eigenvalues. If the channels-by-time power time series data <b>X</b> has eigenvectors and eigenvalues <b>V</b> and <b>D</b>, then the sphered data are defined as <b>Y</b>=<b>X<sup>T</sup>VD<sup>-\u00bd</sup></b>, where <b><sup>T</sup></b> indicates the matrix transpose and <b><sup>-\u00bd</sup></b> indicates the square root of the matrix inverse. Next, the bias filter is expanded into a Toeplitz matrix (<b>B</b>) that left-multiplies the data as <b>BY</b>. The eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix of <b>BY</b> provides a new set of eigenvectors <b>W</b>, which are used to rotate the original eigenspace of the data as <b>VD<sup>-\u00bd</sup>W</b>. The spatial filter with the largest eigenvalue is applied to the non-sphered narrow-band multichannel power time series data to obtain the component. This procedure is repeated over a range of higher frequencies, using the same <b>B</b> matrix for all frequencies."

For example, a first-order time-delay embedded matrix of 64 electrodes would have 128 rows; the first 64 rows are taken from the 64 electrodes and time points 1 to end-1, while the next 64 rows are taken from the same 64 electrodes and time points two to end. Importantly, because GED doesn\u2019t \u2018know\u2019 that the data come from time-delayed versions of the same electrodes, the weights assigned to time-delayed rows act as temporal weights from which a temporal filter is empirically computed (<a href=\"#bib17\">de Cheveign\u00e9, 2010</a>). For example, a filter that finds the temporal derivative would have weights of 1 and \u22121 for the original and time-delayed rows. In practice, more than one delay embedding is useful. Time-delay embedding was developed in dynamical systems analysis, and has been successfully applied to psychometric and neural data (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brunton et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">de Cheveign\u00e9 and Simon, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lainscsek and Sejnowski, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tome et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">von Oertzen and Boker, 2010</a>). After creating this time-delay embedded data matrix, Method 4 proceeds similarly as Method 1: two covariance matrices are computed, one from data surrounding troughs and one from the entire time series, and GED is applied to those two matrices. The eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue is a spatiotemporal filter of size 1 \u00d7MN, where M is the number of channels and N is the number of embeddings. To interpret this filter, its forward model can be reshaped to M\u00d7N and visualized as a time-by-channels matrix."

This occurred even without adding noise to the data, and is attributable to the non-phase-locked nature of the gamma bursts.

A theta component was obtained by comparing covariance matrices between 8 Hz and the average of 4 Hz and 12 Hz (a broadband reference was not used because it was dominated by theta).

Peri-peak covariance matrices were computed, and compared against the total covariance. The eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue identified a component with a spectral peak in the gamma band that had a similar spatial projection onto all channels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

The framework introduced here evades several of these problems. This new framework does not invalidate or antiquate existing CFC measures; traditional CFC methods are well-suited for situations in which the lower and higher frequency dynamics are sinusoidal and are produced by neural circuits that have the same spatial projections to multichannel recordings."

When extracting power, the sign of the time-domain signal is irrelevant.

The Fourier transform of the data was computed using the MATLAB function fft, and was pointwise multiplied by a frequency-domain Gaussian, defined as <i>exp(\u22120.5[x/s]<sup>2</sup>)</i>, where <i>exp</i> indicates the natural exponential, <i>x</i> is a vector of frequencies shifted such that the desired peak frequency of the filter corresponds to 0, and <i>s</i> is <i>\u03c3(2\u03c0\u22121)/(4\u03c0)</i>, where <i>\u03c3</i> is the full width at half maximum of the filter, specified in Hz. This filter is advantageous over equivalently narrow FIR or IIR filters because it contains fewer parameters and has no sharp edges in the frequency domain, and therefore does not require careful inspection of the filter kernel\u2019s temporal and spectral response profiles. The inverse Fourier transform was then applied to the tapered frequency domain signal to get back to the time domain. When power time series were required, the Hilbert transform was applied and its magnitude was taken. MATLAB code to implement this filter is provided with the online code."
