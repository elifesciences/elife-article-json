We elucidate a p110\u03b1-independent role of homodimerized p85\u03b1 in the positive regulation of PTEN stability and activity. p110\u03b1-free p85\u03b1 homodimerizes via two intermolecular interactions (SH3:proline-rich region and BH:BH) to selectively bind unphosphorylated activated PTEN. As a consequence, homodimeric but not monomeric p85\u03b1 suppresses the PI3K pathway by protecting PTEN from E3 ligase WWP2-mediated proteasomal degradation. Further, the p85\u03b1 homodimer enhances the lipid phosphatase activity and membrane association of PTEN. Strikingly, we identified cancer patient-derived oncogenic p85\u03b1 mutations that target the homodimerization or PTEN interaction surface. Collectively, our data suggest the equilibrium of p85\u03b1 monomer\u2013dimers regulates the PI3K pathway and disrupting this equilibrium could lead to disease development."

We elucidate a p110\u03b1-independent role of homodimerized p85\u03b1 in the positive regulation of PTEN stability and activity. p110\u03b1-free p85\u03b1 homodimerizes via two intermolecular interactions (SH3:proline-rich region and BH:BH) to selectively bind unphosphorylated activated PTEN. As a consequence, homodimeric but not monomeric p85\u03b1 suppresses the PI3K pathway by protecting PTEN from E3 ligase WWP2-mediated proteasomal degradation. Further, the p85\u03b1 homodimer enhances the lipid phosphatase activity and membrane association of PTEN. Strikingly, we identified cancer patient-derived oncogenic p85\u03b1 mutations that target the homodimerization or PTEN interaction surface. Collectively, our data suggest the equilibrium of p85\u03b1 monomer\u2013dimers regulates the PI3K pathway and disrupting this equilibrium could lead to disease development."

Cell proliferation and many other cell processes can be regulated through a signaling pathway that involves an enzyme called PI3K. This \u2018heterodimeric\u2019 enzyme is made up of two protein subunits, one of which is called p85\u03b1 and inhibits the other subunit of the enzyme (known as p110) to prevent uncontrolled cell proliferation. At the same time, p85\u03b1 stabilizes p110 and allows the PI3K pathway to be briefly activated when appropriate. Many cancer cells contain mutations in the gene that encodes p85\u03b1 that prevent the protein from inhibiting p110. This results in the activation of PI3K and promotes cancer formation. A protein called PTEN is a key inhibitor of the PI3K pathway. Common mutations to the <i>PTEN</i> gene in cancer cells stop the PTEN protein working efficiently, or prevent PTEN production."

Cheung et al. have now used biochemical, cell biological and computational methods to investigate the role of these p85\u03b1 homodimers. This revealed that p85\u03b1 homodimers stop PTEN being broken down by binding to it. As a consequence, there is enough PTEN in the cell to inhibit the PI3K pathway."

PTEN therefore degrades and cannot inhibit the PI3K pathway, which allows the cells to proliferate. Methods that increase p85\u03b1 homodimer formation or enhance the ability of p85\u03b1 homodimers to bind to PTEN may therefore provide new approaches for developing cancer treatments. More generally, it appears that maintaining the correct balance between the amount of p85\u03b1 in the form of p110-bound heterodimers and p110-free homodimers in a cell may be important for preventing diseases involving the PI3K pathway."

Activation of the class 1A PI3K is gated, in part, by the p85\u03b1 regulatory subunit, which contains a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, two proline-rich (PR) regions (PR1 and PR2) separated by a Rho-GAP/BCR-homology (BH) domain, and two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (nSH2, cSH2) flanking an inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain. The interaction of p85\u03b1 nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment with the p110 catalytic subunit represses p110 activity allosterically and also stabilizes p110 against degradation, creating a pool of stable but quiescent p110 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yu et al., 1998</a>). Upon receptor tyrosine kinase activation, p85\u03b1 undergoes phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events that alleviate p110 inhibition resulting in p110-mediated production of PI(3,4,5)P3 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cuevas et al., 2001</a>). Strikingly, <i>PIK3R1</i>, the gene coding for p85\u03b1, is the twelfth most frequently mutated gene across all cancers. Indeed, somatic mutations of the p85\u03b1:p110\u03b1 interface disrupt the inhibitory action of p85\u03b1 on bound p110\u03b1 leading to PI3K pathway activation in cancers (<a href=\"#bib33\">Miled et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jaiswal et al., 2009</a>). However, <i>PIK3R1</i> mutations outside the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment are relatively common in cancers, particularly endometrial cancer. The mechanisms underlying the transforming activity of these mutations remain to be elucidated and may provide novel biomarkers or therapeutic opportunities."

We and others have also shown that the BH domain binds to the tumor suppressor PTEN to promote PTEN protein stability and that at least one <i>PIK3R1</i> somatic mutation interferes with this process (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chagpar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cheung et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, intermolecular interactions between the SH3 domain and the PR region of p85\u03b1 contribute to p85\u03b1 homodimerization (<a href=\"#bib16\">Harpur et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cheung et al., 2011</a>). However, the function of p85\u03b1 homodimers remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that p110\u03b1-free p85\u03b1 homodimers positively regulate PTEN and that this regulatory mechanism is disrupted by mutations in a subset of endometrial cancers. Together, our findings suggest that the relative abundance of p110\u03b1-bound p85\u03b1 monomer and p110\u03b1-free p85\u03b1 homodimer is critical in PI3K pathway regulation."

However, how each motif contributes to homodimerization and the orientation of the homodimer remain unknown. Using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and microscale thermophoresis (MST), we demonstrated that purified recombinant full-length p85\u03b1 homodimerized with a micromolar dissociation constant <i>K</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> in absence of other proteins under reducing conditions (<i>K</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> was 7 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcM and 3.9 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM for AUC and MST, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig1s1 fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>).

These mutants were expressed in an endometrial cancer cell line KLE, which expresses low level of endogenous p85\u03b1 and does not have mutations in major members of the PI3K pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that mutations in prolines (denoted as PR1mut) or basic residues (PR1mut') in PR1 decreased p85\u03b1 homodimerization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Consistent with our hypothesis that homodimerized p85\u03b1 binds PTEN, PR1mut, and PR1mut' decreased the association of p85\u03b1 with PTEN (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Interestingly, both PR2mut (proline residues mutated) and PR2mut' (basic residues mutated) decreased binding to PTEN without affecting p85\u03b1 dimerization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), suggesting that PR2 contributes directly to PTEN binding rather than to p85\u03b1 homodimerization. Accordingly, PTEN binding was further decreased by combined mutations of PR1 and PR2 (PR1+PR2mut and PR1+PR2mut'), which however did not decrease p85\u03b1 homodimerization compared to PR1 mutations alone. These observations were replicated in p85\u03b1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>) and more importantly in PTEN knockout MEFs (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>), indicating that the p85\u03b1 homodimer is able to form in the absence of PTEN."

Mutations of E19 and E20, which situate on the SH3 RT loop and may contribute to long-range electrostatic interactions with PR1 (e.g., K88 and R90), also decreased p85\u03b1 homodimerization and PTEN binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

The spatial separation of p85\u03b1 homodimerization from p110\u03b1 interaction sites is further supported by our observations that a truncation p85\u03b1 mutant, A360*, which lacks the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment to bind p110\u03b1, displayed comparable p85\u03b1 homodimerization and PTEN binding to wild-type (WT) p85\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>).

Together, these results suggest that a canonical SH3:PR1 interaction in trans contributes to the formation of the homodimeric p85\u03b1 platform for PTEN binding, whereas PR2 contributes to binding to PTEN through an alternative mechanism and potentially by direct PTEN binding."

The crystallographic dimer is stabilized by M176 that inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed mainly by L164', I177', V181' (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The BH:BH interface in the crystal structure is highly conserved in vertebrates. As experimental support for this BH dimer, we found that a M176A mutation decreased p85\u03b1 homodimerization and PTEN binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>).

Indeed, we measured a much lower affinity for p85\u03b1 PR1-BH (AUC: 163 \u03bcM; MST: 23 \u03bcM) than for constructs containing the SH3-PR1-BH region (<a href=\"#fig1s1 fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1C and 2L</a>). Together with the decrease in p85\u03b1 homodimerization that occurred with combined mutations of PR1 and M176 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), these data support a model wherein the p85\u03b1 homodimer is stabilized by both SH3:PR1 and BH:BH interactions. The length of the SH3-BH linker is sufficient for SH3:PR1 interactions in trans within the context of the crystal-derived BH:BH dimer (<a href=\"#fig10\">Appendix figure 3</a> in <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). Collectively, our data are consistent with a molecular model for the p85\u03b1 homodimer in which the SH3 domain binds PR1 in trans through a canonical class I interaction, while simultaneously the two BH domains associate through an interface centered on M176 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). The contribution of the BH domain in the homodimerization of p85 appears to be important, because p85\u03b2, which has a completely conserved SH3 ligand-binding site, an almost identical sequence in the PR1 motif and an 80% identity in the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment, homodimerized and interacted with PTEN to a lesser degree than p85\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). Indeed, the p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2 BH domains share only 30% identity, and in particular the region that mediates BH dimerization in p85\u03b1 is not conserved in p85\u03b2, neither in sequence nor in the published crystallographic structure (p85\u03b1: PDB 1PBW and p85\u03b2: PDB 2XS6) (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>)."

WT p85\u03b1 markedly decreased PTEN ubiquitination compared with LacZ control and more importantly with each of the homodimer-disrupting mutants (R18A, E19A/E20A, D21A/W55A, and R66A in SH3; PR1mut, PR1mut\u2019 in PR1; M176A in BH) and PTEN binding-disrupting mutants (PR2mut and PR2mut') (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). Ubiquitinated PTEN in cells expressing the mutants was less than that in cells expressing LacZ because there was more PTEN-bound homodimer present in the mutant cells. PR1+PR2mut and PR1+PR2mut' increased ubiquitinated PTEN compared with single mutations, suggesting cooperativity between PR1 and PR2 in preventing PTEN ubiquitination. Further, the increased PTEN ubiquitination in the presence of these mutants was associated with decreased PTEN protein levels and hence activation of the PI3K pathway as indicated by increased AKT phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>). Conversely, p85\u03b2 failed to stabilize PTEN, as expected from the reduced dimerization and altered BH domain structure of this isoform (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5C</a>)."

Importantly, WT p85\u03b1 decreased the binding of PTEN to WWP2 without a demonstrable effect on NEDD4 binding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Mutations in PR1 or PR2 increased interactions between PTEN and WWP2, suggesting that homodimerized p85\u03b1 decreases PTEN ubiquitination by preventing WWP2 from binding PTEN. Again, siRNA and/or inhibitor-based interference with S6K, mTORC2, and AKT signaling had no effect on the interaction of PTEN with WWP2, suggesting that the increase in PTEN:WWP2 association is directly linked to the failure of the p85\u03b1 mutants to bind PTEN, and not to indirect effects on other PI3K pathway components (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Indeed, both p85\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and WWP2 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Maddika et al., 2011</a>) bound to the PTEN phosphatase domain (residues 14\u2013187), suggesting that p85\u03b1 and WWP2 may compete for PTEN binding. A competition model is supported by the observation that WWP2 dose-dependently decreased the interaction between p85\u03b1 and PTEN (Left, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) and p85\u03b1-induced PTEN stabilization (Right, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Reciprocally, p85\u03b1 inhibited binding of WWP2 to PTEN (Left, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) and reversed the decrease in PTEN levels induced by WWP2 (Right, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In contrast, p85\u03b1 PR1+PR2mut (which does not bind PTEN efficiently) failed to reverse the effect of WWP2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). As an additional support of the competition model, siRNAs that target endogenous p85\u03b1 or WWP2 decreased the interaction of PTEN with WWP2 or p85\u03b1, respectively, in an endometrial cancer cell line HEC1A that expresses high levels of p85\u03b1 and WWP2 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Together, these data indicate that p85\u03b1 homodimers compete with WWP2 for binding to an overlapping site on the PTEN phosphatase domain and thereby inhibit PTEN ubiquitination."

Given p85\u03b1 homodimerization is a key regulator of PTEN and PI3K pathway activation status, mutations that affect p85\u03b1 homodimerization or association with PTEN would be expected to increase PI3K pathway activation and tumorigenesis. We therefore searched our in-house endometrial cancer data set (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cheung et al., 2011</a>) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cerami et al., 2012</a>) for cancer patient-derived <i>PIK3R1</i> mutations that could target p85\u03b1 homodimerization. Among mutations in the BH domain, E175K (in skin cutaneous melanoma; TCGA) and I177N (in endometrial cancer (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cheung et al., 2011</a>)) localize to the BH:BH dimer interface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) and occur at sites that are highly conserved across species. I177 is a key residue of the BH:BH hydrophobic core. Substitution of the bulky hydrophobic isoleucine by a smaller and partly polar residue would be predicted to weaken homodimerization. Indeed, I177N decreased homodimer formation, decreased PTEN binding, increased ubiquitinated PTEN, and increased phosphorylated AKT consistent with PI3K pathway activation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). I177N also promoted interleukin-3 (IL3)-independent survival of the IL3-dependent BaF3 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jaiswal et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cheung et al., 2011</a>), consistent with the oncogenic potential of the mutant. These results indicate that I177N could act as an oncogenic mutation at least in part by perturbing p85\u03b1 homodimerization. Of note, I177N has biochemical phenotypes similar to E160*, which is a patient-derived p85\u03b1 mutant that disrupts p85\u03b1 homodimerization and destabilizes PTEN protein (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cheung et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, E175 localizes to the polar and charged rim of the BH:BH interface with our model predicting that the E175K mutation would only have minimal influence on the BH:BH interaction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Indeed, biochemical analysis failed to detect effects of E175K on PTEN levels, ubiquitination, p85\u03b1 binding, and pAKT as well as on proliferation of BaF3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>)."

These homodimers can form in absence of other proteins. Collectively, our results illustrate opposing functions of the p85\u03b1 monomer and homodimer. As a homodimer, p85\u03b1 competes with WWP2 for binding to the PTEN phosphatase domain and protects PTEN against WWP2-mediated degradation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The p85\u03b1 homodimer also enhances the activity and membrane association of PTEN. Thus, homodimeric p85\u03b1 indirectly downregulates PI3K signaling. Although the p85\u03b1 homodimer does not bind p110\u03b1, it remains to be ascertained whether the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment of p85\u03b1 homodimer can bind phosphotyrosines in activated cell surface molecules and thereby recruit PTEN to the activation nidus. As a monomer, p85\u03b1 binds p110\u03b1 in a 1:1 ratio (<a href=\"#bib27\">Layton et al., 1998</a>). This interaction is intrinsically inhibitory but it stabilizes p110\u03b1 and allows activation of the p85\u03b1:p110\u03b1 complex upon stimulation, promoting propagation of ligand-dependent PI3K pathway signaling. We therefore propose that the p85\u03b1 monomer\u2013dimer equilibrium is a gatekeeper for PI3K pathway activation."

Phosphorylated PTEN is in a \u2018closed\u2019 conformation in which the phosphatase domain is auto-inhibited by the C-terminal tail. In contrast, unphosphorylated PTEN is in an \u2018open\u2019 conformation with the catalytic domain exposed, leading to increased membrane association and activity. The observation that p85\u03b1 homodimers selectively target the unphosphorylated and less stable form of PTEN fits into a mechanistic model wherein in the absence of excess p85\u03b1, and thus, in the absence of p85\u03b1 homodimers, the unphosphorylated and active PTEN is destabilized, allowing PI3K pathway activation initiated by p110\u03b1-bound p85\u03b1 monomers. Further, our data showed that p85\u03b1 can bind PTEN, promote PTEN activity and membrane binding in the absence of other proteins. Therefore, the interaction between p85\u03b1 and PTEN appears to be direct and does not require the presence of other proteins, although p85\u03b1 and PTEN are part of a high-molecular weight complex containing multiple other proteins."

There are several possible scenarios in which the dynamics of p85\u03b1 homodimer formation could be altered. For example, our data in this and previous studies (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cheung et al., 2011</a>) suggested that p110\u03b1 can disrupt p85\u03b1 homodimerization by decreasing the abundance of p110\u03b1-free p85\u03b1. An increase in p110\u03b1 levels, such as through <i>PIK3CA</i> gene amplification, might therefore decrease p85\u03b1 homodimerization leading to PTEN destabilization. Secondly and intriguingly, <i>PIK3R1</i> also encodes for two functional splice variants, p55\u03b1 and p50\u03b1, which lack the domains required for homodimerization. By sequestering p110\u03b1, p55\u03b1, and p50\u03b1 could increase the amount of free p85\u03b1. Moreover, naturally occurring somatic <i>PIK3R1</i> mutations (I177N and E160*) and likely others disrupt p85\u03b1 homodimerization, including mutations at P99 in PR1, R162*, frame shifts at Q153, D168, H180, V181, and L182 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cheung et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cerami et al., 2012</a>). Further, a patient-derived p85\u03b1 mutant I133N that targets the PTEN interaction interface was identified using our speculative theoretical p85\u03b1:PTEN model. The <i>PIK3R1</i> mutations may hence be selected, at least in part, by effects on p85\u03b1 homodimer formation and PTEN destabilization. Intriguingly, the proposed p85\u03b1-binding site on PTEN also overlaps with a PTEN surface that is frequently mutated in cancers (in 30% of the missense mutations of the phosphatase domain), suggesting that some of these PTEN mutants may disrupt association with p85\u03b1 therefore decreasing PTEN protein stability and activity."

For example, the region outlined by I127/I133/E137 is close to in space to PR2 and both regions could thus together constitute a binding site for PTEN, possibly explaining the cooperativity between these residues in PTEN binding (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The model also proposes that PTEN:BH interaction renders a site of PTEN ubiquitination K13 inaccessible, suggesting a mechanism for how p85\u03b1 could protect PTEN from ubiquitination (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Moreover, the model predicts that the phosphorylated C-terminal tail of the \u2018closed\u2019 inactive PTEN competes with the p85\u03b1 PR2 for binding to the phosphatase domain of PTEN, providing a plausible explanation for why p85\u03b1 selectively binds unphosphorylated PTEN."

Instead, our theoretical model proposes that the PTEN phosphatase domain binds to the BH domain of only one p85\u03b1 protomer, opposite to the GTPase-binding site (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). To explain the requirement of a stable p85\u03b1 homodimer for PTEN binding and protection, our model suggests that (i) although the PTEN phosphatase domain only binds to one BH molecule, the flexible N-terminal 13 residues of PTEN may interact with the second BH molecule of the dimer (in our model, PTEN residue 14 is close to and its main chain orients towards the BH:BH domain interface) and/or (ii) homodimerization allosterically affects the PTEN-binding site on BH (p85\u03b1 residues I127/I133/E137 are close to the BH:BH homodimerization interface). Although our molecular model is supported by experimental data and showed strong predictive power, it remains hypothetical and we cannot exclude that other structural complexes could satisfy our constraints, or that some of the constraints are wrong. For instance, our model assumes that the PTEN:p85\u03b1(:GTPase) assembly is symmetric and homogenous. Yet, there could be other possible scenarios, for example, where only one of two p85\u03b1 homodimer\u2013bound PTEN molecules is able to reach the membrane with its catalytic site, or where only one p85\u03b1 molecule of the homodimer binds to a GTPase, allowing a PTEN molecule to bind to both p85\u03b1 molecules of the dimer's other side. Moreover, the contribution of flexible regions in protein interactions makes the structural modeling of these interactions necessarily more uncertain. Accordingly, uncertainty in our speculative PTEN:p85\u03b1 complex model arises from the lack of precise information concerning the structure and possible interactions of the flexible regions of PTEN (the first 13 residues) and p85\u03b1 (the PR2 region, and the loop between residues 123 and 130). Thus, while currently representing a useful working model for guiding and informing experimental analysis, our theoretical PTEN:p85\u03b1 structure requires confirmation by an experimental structure."

These findings lend new insight to how changes in p110 levels through amplification or <i>PIK3R1</i> mutations could lead to PI3K pathway hyperactivation and thus contribute to diseases such as cancer. By decreasing PTEN expression and activity, these non-nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 <i>PIK3R1</i> mutations may affect sensitivity to particular targeted therapeutics. Indeed, p110\u03b2 rather than p110\u03b1 has been proposed as the primary target in cells with PTEN protein loss (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jia et al., 2008</a>). Targeting p85\u03b1 homodimerization or the p85\u03b1:PTEN interaction may represent a new avenue for cancer treatment."

Briefly, protein lysates (1 mg) were subjected to IP of endogenous PTEN using anti-PTEN or anti-p85\u03b1 antibody and the bead complex was resuspended in PTEN reaction buffer before PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate was added to initiate the reaction. Reaction mixture with PIP<sub>3</sub> but not lysate was used for background correction. The reaction was stopped after 4-hr incubation at 37\u00b0C and the supernatant was separated from the beads for activity detection. The beads were used for WB to quantify immunoprecipitated PTEN. The activity was normalized to immunoprecipitated PTEN level in each sample. To assess the activity of recombinant PTEN, 1 \u03bcg of PTEN was incubated with 1 \u03bcg of recombinant p85\u03b1 in buffer containing 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (PTEN reaction buffer without DTT) at room temperature for 1 hr before being subjected to the reaction."

We found that mutations in the GTPases binding site of p85\u03b1 did not affect PTEN binding and that Cdc42 and Rab5 did not compete with PTEN for binding to p85\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A-B</a>). The interaction between p85\u03b1 and small GTPases can be modeled based on the available crystal structure of Cdc42 bound to Cdc42GAP (1GRN). Cdc42GAP is 22% identical to p85\u03b1 BH. The structure of Cdc42-bound Cdc42GAP was superimposed onto the structure of p85\u03b1 BH (rmsd: 2.48 \u00c5; <a href=\"#fig8\">Appendix figure 1</a>). Using the Cdc42:Cdc42GAP positioning from this superimposition, Cdc42 was transferred to p85\u03b1 BH to produce a BH:Cdc42 model. The BH:Cdc42 model produced no important clashes and put the BH arginine 151 into the position of the Cdc42GAP R305, an important residue for GAP function and interaction, thus confirming the positioning of the GTPase on BH, at least to a domain-resolution precision. We then used the structure of this BH:Cdc42 model to produce a BH:Rab5 model by using bound Cdc42 as a template for bound Rab5 (25% seq. identity). As an alternative approach, we superimposed the crystal structure of GTP analogue-bound Rab5 (1R2Q) onto GAP-bound Cdc42. Both Rab5 models were highly similar (rmsd = 1.12 \u00c5). All obtained models of BH:GTPase are sufficiently structurally compatible and plausible (shape complementarity without steric hindrance) to serve our purpose of delineating the approximate region on BH occupied by a biologically relevant GTPase."

To ascertain that this type of interaction is physically compatible with the crystallographic BH dimer, we used the program BUNCH (<a href=\"#bib23\">Konarev et al., 2006</a>) as a fast and convenient tool, because BUNCH produces stereochemically plausible structures, and can include symmetry and contact constraints. Because BUNCH needs a SAXS curve as input to run, we simply simulated a large array of SAXS data sets in order to run BUNCH. We used ten different simulated data sets (calculated based on models with different SH3 positions with respect to the fixed BH domain dimer) to evaluate the impact of the model used to simulate the SAXS data. For each data set, we ran BUNCH 20 times (BUNCH uses Monte Carlo and simulated annealing and hence can give different models for each run, based on the same data). We found that the impact of the model used for simulating data was small compared with the variations in models obtained using different BUNCH runs. In these models, distance constraints were imposed so that the residues of the PR1 RXXPXXP motif were positioned at the right distance with respect to the residues on SH3 with which they interact in our molecular model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Additionally, we augmented the weight of the clash penalty in BUNCH. Using these constraints, BUNCH produced stereochemically plausible solutions where the SH3 domains were positioned either close to (or in contact with) the BH domain of the same molecule (example shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) or of the other protomer; <a href=\"#fig10\">Appendix figure 3A\u2013C</a>). Moreover, the SH3 domains were either positioned towards the N-terminus (<a href=\"#fig10\">Appendix figure 3A,B</a>), or towards the C-terminus of the BH domains (<a href=\"#fig10\">Appendix figure 3C</a>). However, the C-terminal positioning of SH3 domains was incompatible with the interaction of GTPases with the BH domain, because the SH3-BH linker region necessarily crossed the GTPase-binding site on BH, and/or the SH3 domains clashed with the GTPase domains. Given that GTPases and PTEN can bind simultaneously, and given that PTEN binding requires the SH3:PR1 interaction, the C-terminal positioning of SH3 domains was not supported by our data. We therefore concluded that the SH3:PR1 interaction is possible within the BH:BH domain dimer framework and that the SH3 domain needs to be located at the N-terminal side of the BH:BH domain dimer."

Moreover, we showed that this interaction strongly depends on both PR2 and dimeric p85\u03b1. This can be explained in two ways: (1) The PTEN:p85\u03b1 interaction is not a simple peptide:domain interaction between the PR2 peptide and the PTEN phosphatase domain, but also involves direct domain:domain interactions between dimeric p85\u03b1 SH3-PR1-BH and PTEN. (2) The PTEN:p85\u03b1 interaction is only a peptide:domain interaction between PR2 and PTEN, and the requirement for dimeric p85\u03b1 is explained solely by a (flexible) cross-linking of two PTEN molecules. The combined SH3-BH-PR2:PTEN interaction from option 1 appears to be more suitable to explain all phenotypes we observe for the p85\u03b1 association (protection from WWP2-mediated ubiquitination by outcompeting WWP2, enhanced membrane anchoring, increased phosphatase activity against soluble substrates). However, at this stage, we cannot categorically rule out option 2. We therefore first investigate the more likely option 1 and then evaluate option 2."

The surface of PTEN that binds to membranes and the catalytic site that requires binding phospholipid head groups are known (<a href=\"#fig11\">Appendix figure 4A</a>). Based on this information, we oriented PTEN with respect to the membrane. We then used this PTEN:membrane interaction constraint to place p85\u03b1 with respect to PTEN. In option 1, the requirement for a p85\u03b1 dimer is justified by dimeric SH3-PR1-BH-PR2, providing a combined binding surface for PTEN. Given the symmetry of the BH domains and the distance between the PR2 regions, we expect that one PTEN binds to one p85\u03b1 molecule of the homodimer and that two PTEN molecules bound to the p85\u03b1 homodimer associate simultaneously with the membrane. Hence, the twofold symmetry axis of the BH dimer has to be perpendicular to the membrane plane. In a model where the p85\u03b1 dimer is oriented with the SH3 domains towards the membrane, the SH3 domains, even if in close contact with the BH domains, would collide with the membrane and thus block simultaneous interaction of two bound PTEN molecules with the membrane (<a href=\"#fig11\">Appendix figure 4B</a>). As a consequence, the p85\u03b1 dimer is most likely oriented with the SH3 domains pointing away from the membrane. Such an orientation would also allow simultaneous binding of GTPases and PTEN to both the p85\u03b1 dimer and the membrane."

We hypothesize that dimerization is required for either allosterically rearranging the PTEN binding site on the BH domain, or to allow stabilizing interactions between the second BH domain and the flexible 13 N-terminal residues of a PTEN molecule which binds with its phosphatase domain to the first BH domain. The PTEN:p85\u03b1 interaction also involves PTEN R14, next to K13, a major PTEN ubiquitination site. To test this PTEN:p85\u03b1 docking model, but also to test interaction option 1 (PTEN binds SH3-PR1-BH in addition to PR2) against option 2 (PTEN only binds PR2 region of p85\u03b1), we introduced the triple mutations I127A/I133A/E137A in the BH domain. The observations that this mutation on BH specifically affected PTEN binding, but not p85\u03b1 dimerization, and that this mutation is synergistic with PR2 mutations support our molecular model (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). More generally, the effect of these mutations supports interaction option 1. The observation that residues within this triple mutant affect PTEN binding eliminates the possibility that one PTEN phosphatase domain binds simultaneously to two BH domains within the dimer, because the dimensions of one PTEN phosphatase domain and the space constraints from the bound GTPase do not allow simultaneous contacts of one PTEN phosphatase domain with PR2, the three mutated residues and the two BH protomers."

In addition, we also targeted AKT activity using the specific AKT inhibitor MK2206. S6K siRNA increased AKT phosphorylation implicating the existence of negative feedback in KLE cells. In contrast to the suggested role in mediating a positive feedback at least in some cell lines, Rictor siRNA did not decrease phosphorylated AKT in the KLE cell line, although the siRNA decreased Rictor expression by 80%. Importantly, both S6K and Rictor siRNA had no effect on PTEN interactions with p85\u03b1 or WWP2. Rapamycin and MK2206, which efficiently inhibited mTOR and AKT phosphorylation, respectively, also had no effect on these PTEN interactions with p85\u03b1 or WWP. Thus, inhibition of these feedback and feedforward loops, and inhibition of different nodes of the PI3K pathway, does not affect the degree of PTEN association with p85\u03b1 or WWP2, suggesting that the PTEN interactions with p85\u03b1 or WWP2 are unlikely to be explained by mutant-triggered changes in PI3K downstream signaling or regulatory loops.

To further assess the reviewers' question, we used immunoprecipitation assays and observed that p85\u03b2 homodimerized and interacted with PTEN but the interactions were much weaker than observed for p85\u03b1. Further, in contrast to wild type p85\u03b1, p85\u03b2 did not stabilize PTEN (data are now added in <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 5A and 5C</a>)."

In contrast, p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2 share only 30% protein sequence identity between their BH domains that are critical for PTEN binding. Importantly, the BH region that mediates dimerization in p85\u03b1 is not conserved in p85\u03b2, neither in sequence nor in structure (the structure of the p85\u03b2 BH domain has been deposited in the PDB, accession number 2XS6, but no associated manuscript has been published to date). Accordingly, the BH domain dimer centered on M176 present in the p85\u03b1 crystal is not present in the crystal lattice of p85\u03b2 BH (see <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 5B</a>). Instead, the p85\u03b2 BH domain crystals contain another symmetric domain-domain interface. Therefore if the p85\u03b2 BH domain contributes to stabilizing p85\u03b2 homodimers, then it would do this using a different dimerization interface than p85\u03b1 BH. Given that the dimeric structure of p85\u03b1 BH domain is important for both PTEN binding and stabilization, these data explain our experimental observation of weak PTEN binding and lack of PTEN stabilization by p85\u03b2.
