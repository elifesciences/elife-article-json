One well-known axis in epithelial cells, such as those in the skin, divides the cell into an apical domain, which faces out, and a basal domain, which faces the underlying tissue. These cells rely on the distribution of structural components inside the cell, or within the cell membrane, to tell the difference between these two directions. Epithelial cells also possess a second type of polarity, planar cell polarity, that ensures that cells adjacent to each other in the plane parallel to the skin tissue are oriented correctly with respect to each other during development. This ensures, in turn, that hairs, scales, feathers and so on are all aligned."

As one of these proteins moves through the Golgi apparatus, its sorting signals are recognized by coat proteins, such as clathrin, that subsequently form a vesicle around it. The assembly of this vesicle is initiated by an enzyme from the Arf family, but the enzyme must first undergo a conformational change (by exchanging a molecule of GDP for one of GTP) before formation can begin. The resulting vesicle can then be sent on its way to the address indicated by its Golgi-to-cell-surface sorting signal. These sorting signals also help to establish planar cell polarity in cells by ensuring that proteins called signaling receptors are distributed asymmetrically within the cell membrane."

In an effort to understand why these proteins are localized to opposite surfaces of epithelial cells, Guo et al. used genetic techniques to reduce the expression of Golgi-localized Arf proteins in epithelial cell cultures. They found that knockdown of a protein called Arfrp1 caused Vangl2 to accumulate in the last station of the Golgi complex instead of being transported to the cell surface membrane. Then, using a technique called affinity chromatography, they demonstrated that a coat protein called the clathrin adaptor complex (AP-1) had to be present for the formation of vesicles around Vangl2. Moreover, disrupting AP-1 and Arfrp1 did not prevent Frizzled 6 being transported to the cell surface membrane. This suggests that cells use several distinct adaptor proteins and coat complexes to ensure that proteins from the Golgi apparatus go to specific locations on the cell surface and, thus, help to establish planar cell polarity."

This long range order orchestrates proper development and organ function. The establishment of PCP is regulated by a set of evolutionarily conserved signaling receptors. A key feature of these signaling receptors is that they are asymmetrically localized on the cell boundaries during PCP signaling (<a href=\"#bib28\">Klein and Mlodzik, 2005</a>). The mechanisms that mediate the asymmetric localization of PCP signaling molecules remain unclear. One hypothesis is that interactions between PCP signaling molecules across cell junctions could stabilize their polarized localization to opposing cell boundaries (<a href=\"#bib28\">Klein and Mlodzik, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2008</a>). Proteins that organize epithelial cells include the atypical cadherin Fat, Dachsous and the Golgi resident protein Four-jointed in <i>Drosophila</i> which have been proposed to provide long range patterning cues to regulate PCP asymmetry (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bayly and Axelrod, 2011</a>). Additional evidence suggests that intracellular trafficking may also contribute to the asymmetric localization of PCP signaling receptors (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shimada et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Strutt and Strutt, 2008</a>)."

Among the known vesicle coat proteins, clathrin adaptor complexes (AP) have been shown to mediate sorting of various transmembrane cargoes at the TGN by directly interacting with tyrosine- or dileucine-based sorting motifs localized within the cytosolic domain of a transmembrane cargo molecule (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rodriguez-Boulan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Burgos et al., 2010</a>).

Mammalian cells possess 6 Arf proteins and more than 20 Arf-like proteins. The intracellular roles of the majority of Arf proteins are poorly understood. A genome-wide RNA interference screen indicates that Arf1 and Arfrp1 are required for secretion of recombinant luciferase from <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wendler et al., 2010</a>).

Interestingly, TGN export of one other PCP signaling receptor, Frizzled-6, is independent of the Arfrp1/AP-1 machinery, suggesting that differential sorting machineries regulate the TGN export of Vangl2 and Frizzled 6, which may contribute to their opposing localization on the epithelial cell surface."

The screen indicated that knockdown of Arf1 or Arfrp1 caused a juxtanuclear accumulation of Vangl2 whereas knockdown of other Golgi-localized Arfs did not affect Vangl2 trafficking. Arf1, which shares a 34% sequence identity with Arfrp1, plays a general role in regulating membrane recruitment of various vesicle coat proteins and lipid modification enzymes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Donaldson and Jackson, 2011</a>). Arfrp1 is more specifically localized at the TGN and has been shown to regulate TGN-to-plasma membrane transport of E-cadherin and VSV-G (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zahn et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nishimoto-Morita et al., 2009</a>). However, what Arfrp1 does to promote traffic has not been explored. We thus focused on Arfrp1 and it\u2019s role in the transport of PCP signaling proteins. The expression of Arfrp1 was efficiently reduced after siRNA treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) and knockdown of Arfrp1 caused a juxtanuclear accumulation of Vangl2 in a majority (65%) of the cells compared to mock treated cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,D,H</a>). Transport-arrested Vangl2 colocalized with the TGN marker, Golgin 97 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013F</a>) but not the early endosomal marker EEA1, the late endosomal marker Rab7 or the recycling endosomal marker Rab11 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Quantification of colocalization indicated that Vangl2 correlated more closely with the TGN marker, Golgin 97, than with the <i>cis</i>-Golgi marker, GM130 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These results suggest that Arfrp1 regulates the export of Vangl2 from the TGN."

Consistent with this hypothesis, the C-terminal cytosolic domain of Vangl2 contains a conserved basolateral-sorting motif (YXXF) which is known to interact with the AP complexes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bonifacino and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2003</a>) (red box, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Indeed, HA-Vangl2 is localized basolaterally in MDCK cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kallay et al., 2006</a>). To test whether this motif is important for the localization of Vangl2, we generated a series of HA-Vangl2 mutant constructs and examined their localization. Strikingly, four Vangl2 mutants bearing mutations in the YXXF motif, including the single mutation (F283A), showed no detectable surface pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,H,K,Q</a>). At high levels of expression, mutant Vangl2 was retained in the ER. However, at lower levels of expression, these Vangl2 mutant proteins accumulated in the juxtanuclear area which colocalized with the TGN marker, Golgin 97 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013M,Q\u2013S</a>). A Vangl2 YXXF double mutant (Y280A, F283A) and Vangl2 looptail mutant (D255E) displayed quite distinctive localization to the TGN and ER, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A single tyrosine mutant, Vangl2 Y280A, was only partially transport defective (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3N\u2013P</a>), whereas the double mutant Y279A Y280A resulted in a more complete arrest of mutant Vangl2 at the TGN (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As a control, substituting alanine for both leucines adjacent to the YXXF motif (green box, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) had no effect on Vangl2 localization (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3T\u2013V</a>).

To test whether \u03bc1-adaptin interacts with Vangl2 via the YYXXF motif, we performed GST pull-down assays using purified GST-\u03bc1 and lysates from COS7 cells transiently transfected with HA-Vangl2 wild-type or mutant constructs. HA-Vangl2 wild type specifically bound GST-\u03bc1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The interaction between Vangl2 and GST-\u03bc1 was severely reduced when crucial residues of the YYXXF motif were mutated, whereas alanine substitutions of the adjacent dileucine amino acids had no effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Yeast two-hybrid analysis confirmed that \u03bc1-adaptin interacted with Vangl2 and mutation of the basolateral sorting motif, including the restrictive F283A substitution, inhibited this interaction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The less restrictive single tyrosine mutant, Vangl2 (Y280A), interacted weakly with \u03bc1-adaptin whereas mutating both tyrosine residues blocked interaction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). To test whether the Vangl2 cytosolic domain directly interacts with \u03bc1-adaptin, we purified GST-\u03bc1 and MBP-tagged Vangl2 C-terminal domain proteins. The MBP-Vangl2 C-terminal domain bound GST-\u03bc1 whereas mutation of the YYXXF motif blocked this interaction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), consistent with a direct and signal-dependent interaction. The interaction pattern correlated well with the Vangl2 mutant localization analysis in transfected cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013V</a>)."

We were unable to address the recruitment of Vangl2 directly because purified Vangl2 cytosolic domain bound liposomes by itself. As an alternative approach, we evaluated the influence of the Vangl2 cytosolic domain and Arfrp1-GTP\u03b3S on the membrane recruitment of AP-1. As shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>, membrane recruitment of AP-1 was enhanced approximately threefold in the presence of both Vangl2 cytosolic domain and Arfrp1-GTP\u03b3S.

Unlike Vangl2, Frizzled 6 was inefficiently transported to the cell surface in transfected HeLa cells. However, when Frizzled-6 was co-expressed with Celsr1, an atypical cadherin, both proteins co-localized at cell junctions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</a>).

Frizzled-6 and Celsr1 have no known tyrosine- or dileucine-based sorting motifs in their cytosolic domains.

Each of these cargo molecules contains a basolateral sorting motif in the C-terminal cytosolic domain. Sequence alignment of protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), another plasma-membrane localized regulator of planar cell polarity (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lu et al., 2004</a>), revealed a conserved tyrosine sorting motif (YVDL) in its predicted cytosolic domain (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We used a C-terminal Myc-His-tagged PTK7 (PTK7-Myc-His) to examine the effect of Arfrp1 depletion on traffic from the TGN. COS7 cells were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA against Arfrp1 and re-transfected after 48 hr with plasmids encoding PTK7-Myc-His. These conditions achieved an siRNA-specific depletion of Arfrp1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>). At steady state, around 50% of cells showed both surface- and Golgi-localized PTK7 in control cells and this localization pattern was not significantly changed in Arfrp1 knockdown cells. Given the high background of PTK7 delayed in the TGN in transfected COS7 cells, we adjusted the experimental conditions using a 20\u00b0C incubation followed by cycloheximide to synchronize a pool of newly-synthesized PTK7 in the TGN in control cells and Arfrp1 knockdown cells. After incubation at 20\u00b0C, a majority of cells (80%) showed strong accumulation of PTK7 at the TGN. After cells were returned to 32\u00b0C, a significantly higher percentage accumulated PTK7 at the TGN when Arfrp1 was depleted than in cells treated with control siRNA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013G</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I</a>, 12 \u00b1 8% vs 49 \u00b1 6%).

Arfrp1 is recruited to TGN membranes upon GTP binding, possibly mediated by a TGN localized GEF. Subsequently, GTP-bound Arfrp1 recruits AP-1 to TGN membranes. GTP-bound Arfrp1 also promotes an open conformation of AP-1 that directly interacts with the tyrosine motif on Vangl2 cytosolic domain, thereby enriching Vangl2 in budding vesicles. Binding of Vangl2 cytosolic domain to AP-1, in turn, stabilizes the membrane association of AP-1 to allow sufficient time for AP-1 polymerization (possibly with clathrin as a coat outer layer) and vesicle budding. This model is consistent with reports showing that tyrosine sorting motifs promote membrane recruitment of AP-1 mediated by Arf1 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Crottet et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2008</a>).

For example, Sar1 initiates COPII coat assembly at the ER (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zanetti et al., 2012</a>); Arf1 is required for COPI-mediated vesicle budding and for the recruitment of clathrin AP-1 to the TGN and endosomes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gillingham and Munro, 2007</a>); Arl6 binds the BBsome to segregate cell surface proteins into the membrane of the primary cilium (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jin et al., 2010</a>). Several of the Arfs and Arls are localized to the TGN of mammalian cells, and at least one, Arfrp1, is required for TGN to cell surface traffic of E-cadherin and VSV-G (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zahn et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nishimoto-Morita et al., 2009</a>). Here we show that knockdown of Arfrp1 arrests the traffic of Vangl2 in a compartment that colocalizes with TGN markers but not with endosomal markers, confirming that Arfrp1 regulates trafficking from the late Golgi cisternae. Arfrp1 is essential at an early stage in mouse embryonic development (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mueller et al., 2002</a>), possibly because it plays a role in the traffic of crucial cell surface proteins. However, unlike Sar1, which is required for traffic of all secretory cargo from the ER, Arfrp1 is not generally required for the transport of plasma membrane proteins from the TGN. For example, we show in this report that Frizzled 6, another PCP signaling receptor that is displayed on the distal cell surface opposite to Vangl2 on the proximal surface of epithelial cells, does not depend on Arfrp1 for its transit from the TGN."

Moreover, Arfrp1 and Arl1 appear to play different roles in trafficking between TGN and endosomes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nishimoto-Morita et al., 2009</a>). Our analysis indicates that knockdown of Arl1 does not affect the localization of Vangl2 suggesting that Arl1 and its associated GRIP-domain containing proteins are not involved in TGN sorting of Vangl2."

Neither AP-2 nor AP-3 was detected in the proteins that bound to Arfrp1-GTP. We found that the \u00b5 and \u03b3 subunits of the AP-1 complex interact with Arfrp1 and that \u00b5 and \u03b3 subunits are required for the transit of Vangl2 from the TGN. Further, we observed that the residues of the YYXXF sorting motif required for traffic of Vangl2 are also crucial for the interaction of \u03bc1-adaptin with Vangl2. The YYXXF sorting motif fits the consensus sequence of the canonical YXX\u03a6 motif which has been identified in plasma membrane proteins that traffic to the basolateral surface in polarized cells. PTK7, another regulator of planar cell polarity also contains a conserved YXX\u03a6 motif in its predicted C-terminal cytosolic domain and TGN export of PTK7 is also regulated by Arfrp1. Mutation in the canonical YXX\u03a6 motif causes mis-sorting of basolateral proteins to the apical domains (<a href=\"#bib38\">Muth and Caplan, 2003</a>). Here we show that alanine substitution of both of the tyrosine residues or alanine substitution of the phenylalanine residue completely blocks TGN export of Vangl2 to a greater extent than when Arfrp1 is depleted. The surface-localized Vangl2 may be retained during the course of the Arfrp1 knockdown whereas YXX\u03a6 mutant Vangl2 may not reach the cell surface during the course of the transfection. Alternatively, a partially redundant Arf or Arl may replace Arfrp1 to mediate inefficient traffic of Vangl2 from the TGN."

The \u03bc subunit of each adaptor complex preferentially binds distinct but overlapping sets of YXX\u03a6 motifs based on the identity of X and \u03a6 residues and the residues surrounding the tyrosine sorting motif (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ohno et al., 1998</a>). AP-1 regulates trafficking of mannose-6-P receptor from the TGN to endosomes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bonifacino and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2003</a>) and mediates TGN export of potassium channels (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ma et al., 2011</a>). Given its central role in membrane traffic, deletion of various subunits of AP-1 leads to an embryonic lethal phenotype in the mouse (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ohno, 2006</a>). In epithelial cells, some biosynthetic proteins traverse recycling endosomes en route to the basolateral membrane (<a href=\"#bib16\">F\u00f6lsch et al., 2009</a>). Correspondingly, epithelial cells possess two isoforms of AP-1, a Golgi-localized AP-1A and a recycling endosome-localized AP-1B. AP-1A is proposed to mediate TGN export, thus this isoform may participate in Vangl2 traffic. We have not explored the post-Golgi pathway Vangl2 takes en route to the cell surface, thus it remains possible that Vangl2 invokes a recycling endosome in its itinerary to the proximal surface of an epithelial cell."

We find that the sorting motif in the C-terminal domain of Vangl2 enhances AP-1 binding to Arfrp1-GTP\u03b3S on the surface of synthetic liposomes. Similarly, Arf1-GTP binding to AP-1 is promoted by a peptide containing the sorting signal on the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2008</a>) and recruitment of AP-1 to synthetic liposomes requires tyrosine sorting motifs (<a href=\"#bib10\">Crottet et al., 2002</a>).

In the case of Vangl2, we propose that Arfrp1 and the Vangl2 sorting motif favor an open conformation-exposed \u00b5 subunit of AP-1 that is not available in the complex of Arf1 and AP-1. This combination may be responsible for the capture of cargo proteins destined for transport to the proximal cell surface domain in polarized epithelial cells. In a distinct example, a YKFFE sequence recognized by AP-4 directs the traffic of amyloid precursor protein (APP) from the TGN to early endosomes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burgos et al., 2010</a>). This motif binds to a novel site on the surface of the \u03bc4 subunit opposite the canonical tyrosine-signal-binding site. Key residues in this novel binding site are conserved in the \u03bc subunits of other AP complexes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burgos et al., 2010</a>). The YYXXF motif on Vangl2 could occupy an alternative site on \u03bc1, and Arfrp1-AP-1, but not Arf1-AP-1, may promote the exposure of this site. Currently, there is no direct structural evidence for this possibility. In contrast to these examples, Frizzled, which appears to be transported independent of Arfrp1 and AP-1, may rely on another Arf and adaptor protein for traffic to the distal cell surface domain (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>)."

The yeast strain (PJ69-4A) was cotransformed with mouse \u03bc1A construct in pACT2 and Vangl2 cytosolic domain wild type or mutant constructs in pGBT9. Colonies coexpressing both constructs were selected by their ability to grow on selective medium (dropout without tryptophan and leucine). After selection for 3 days, individual colonies were inoculated in selective medium at 30\u00b0C overnight. The colonies were then resuspended in water and the cell concentration was adjusted to OD<sub>600</sub> = 1.0 and serial dilutions were generated. Equal amount of cells for each serial dilution were spotted on selective medium and pictures were taken after 3 days of growth on the selective medium."

We found that the majority of \u03b31-adaptin was dispersed from the TGN after 15min of BFA treatment, which is consistent with previous reports (Shin et al., 2005). It is possible that most of the AP-1 is bound to BFA sensitive Arfs such as Arf1, and only a small fraction is bound to Arfrp1, which is relatively BFA resistant. BFA could also cause indirect effects on structure and lipid composition of the TGN, which may affect AP-1 recruitment."

After the temperature shift/cycloheximide experiment, the percentage of control cells showing Golgi-localized PTK7 dropped to around 12%. Thus we adopted this regimen to synchronize PTK7 in the Golgi region to localize the effect of Arfrp1 knockdown specifically on exit from the Golgi. This is now described in the manuscript. We agree that the defects of PTK7 trafficking in Arfrp1 knockdown cells are likely due to a kinetic delay. Accordingly, we have modified the statement that PTK7 \u201cdepends on Arfrp1 for traffic\u201d. We analyzed the localization of Frizzle 6 in the Arfrp1 knockdown cells in a similar temperature shift/cycloheximide experiment and did not see a difference (now shown in the text and Figure 8J)."

The \u03bc subunit of each adaptor complex preferentially binds distinct but a considerable degree of overlapping sets of YXX\u00d8 motifs (Ohno et al., 1998; Ohno et al., 1996). The affinity of YXX\u00d8 motifs to different adaptor medium subunits is regulated by the identity of the X and \u00d8 residues and the residues surrounding the tyrosine sorting motif as well as the position of the motif within the cytosolic domain (Ohno et al., 1998; Ohno et al., 1996). This is now discussed in the text. Vangl2 is phosphorylated at the cell surface and the N terminal- but not C terminal-cytosolic domain is the major phosphorylation region (Gao et al., 2011). It would be interesting to test whether the tyrosine residues in the YYXXF motif on Vangl2 are phosphorylated to deactivate the interaction between AP-1 and Vangl2, but this is outside of the scope of our current study."

Alternatively, another Arf or Arl protein may engage AP-1 and the YYXXF motif at a low level of efficiency to transport Vangl2 out of the trans-Golgi. This is now discussed in the manuscript."

One can speculate on alternative explanations, but we favor the idea that AP-1 may assume several different conformations to accommodate members of the Arf/Arl GTPases and sorting motifs. The key residues in the novel cargo binding site on \u03bc4 are conserved in the \u03bc subunits of other AP complexes (Burgos et al., 2010). Thus it is possible that \u03bc1 could have multiple cargo binding sites that recognize specific tyrosine sorting motifs. We speculate that the YYXXF motif on Vangl2 could bind a novel cargo-binding site on \u03bc1; Arfrp1, but not Arf1, bound to AP-1 could promote the exposure of this novel cargo-binding site on \u03bc1-adaptin.
