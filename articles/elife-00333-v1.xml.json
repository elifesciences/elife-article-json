Structures of the initial and final states of the HA trimer define the fusion endpoints, but do not specify intermediates. We have characterized these transitions by analyzing low-pH-induced fusion kinetics of individual virions and validated the analysis by computer simulation. We detect initial engagement with the target membrane of fusion peptides from independently triggered HAs within the larger virus-target contact patch; fusion then requires engagement of three or four <i>neighboring</i> HA trimers. Effects of mutations in HA indicate that withdrawal of the fusion peptide from a pocket in the pre-fusion trimer is rate-limiting for both events, but the requirement for cooperative action of several HAs to bring the fusing membranes together leads to a long-lived intermediate state for single, extended HA trimers. This intermediate is thus a fundamental aspect of the fusion mechanism."

Structures of the initial and final states of the HA trimer define the fusion endpoints, but do not specify intermediates. We have characterized these transitions by analyzing low-pH-induced fusion kinetics of individual virions and validated the analysis by computer simulation. We detect initial engagement with the target membrane of fusion peptides from independently triggered HAs within the larger virus-target contact patch; fusion then requires engagement of three or four <i>neighboring</i> HA trimers. Effects of mutations in HA indicate that withdrawal of the fusion peptide from a pocket in the pre-fusion trimer is rate-limiting for both events, but the requirement for cooperative action of several HAs to bring the fusing membranes together leads to a long-lived intermediate state for single, extended HA trimers. This intermediate is thus a fundamental aspect of the fusion mechanism."

These viruses enter cells when two lipid bilayers\u2014one surrounding the virus, the other enclosing the cellular compartment into which the virus has been engulfed\u2014merge to form a single unified membrane. This process, known as membrane fusion, allows the RNA of the virus to gain access to the host cell's molecular machinery, which it commandeers to produce multiple copies of itself and to direct the assembly of new virus particles. The process of membrane fusion generally includes an intermediate hemifused state in which only the adjacent monolayers from each bilayer have merged. In addition to its role in virology, membrane fusion is critical for many other biological processes, including exocytosis, protein trafficking and the fertilization of eggs by sperm."

The hemagglutinin is found on the surface of the virus, and a typical influenza virus particle can have a few hundred such molecules on its surface. When an influenza virus particle binds to the surface of a cell (as a result of these hemagglutinin molecules interacting with cellular receptor molecules), the cell engulfs the virus into an internal compartment called an endosome. Acidification of the endosome, part of the cell's normal activity, triggers a sequence of conformational changes in the hemagglutinin molecules on the surface of the virus. One part of the hemagglutinin inserts itself into the endosomal membrane, and further conformational changes draw the endosomal and viral membranes together into an intermediate, hemifused state; the process then continues until fusion of the two membranes is complete."

Ivanovic et al. have now investigated the molecular details of this process and described the time course of conformational changes undergone by the hemagglutinin molecules from the moment the pH is lowered within the endosome until the time when hemifusion of the endosomal and viral membranes is complete. They find, among other things, that hemifusion proceeds rapidly only when three or four immediately adjacent hemagglutinin molecules have inserted into the endosomal membrane. Since membrane fusion is a very general cellular process, the findings of Ivanovic et al. are relevant to many areas of cell biology, in addition to having potential applications in virology."

Efficient fusion therefore requires a catalyst, a role served in living cells by a fusion protein or protein complex. The influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) has become an important paradigm of a fusion catalyst, in part because of early crystallographic and mechanistic studies and in part because of continued concern about a virus that caused tens of millions of deaths during the 20th century. HA facilitates fusion by undergoing a large-scale conformational change, coupled to the two fusing membranes (virus and target)."

HA is a homotrimer, synthesized as an inactive precursor, [HA<sub>0</sub>]<sub>3</sub>, and activated for fusion by proteolytic cleavage of each chain into HA<sub>1</sub> and HA<sub>2</sub>, yielding [HA<sub>1</sub>-HA<sub>2</sub>]<sub>3</sub>. At the N-terminus of HA<sub>2</sub> is a hydrophobic \u2018fusion peptide', which following cleavage inserts firmly into a pocket near the axis of the trimer (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 1998</a>). Exposure to low pH, which during infection occurs in an endosome, causes the HA<sub>1</sub> \u2018head' to separate from the HA<sub>2</sub> \u2018stem' and enables a set of HA<sub>2</sub> conformational transformations: (1) release of the fusion peptide from its pre-fusion pocket; (2) HA<sub>2</sub> extension; (3) insertion of the fusion peptide into the target membrane; (4) fold-back of the extended HA<sub>2</sub> intermediate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Skehel and Wiley, 2000</a>). This last step brings together the fusion peptide and the C-terminal, transmembrane segment of each HA<sub>2</sub>, anchored respectively in the viral and target membranes, which thus approach each other, either as apposed protrusions or as a single, target-membrane protrusion (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kuzmin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lee, 2010</a>). Fusion then ensues, initially as hemifusion (merger of only the proximal membrane leaflets) and then as formation of a continuous aqueous channel."

(2008)</a> devised a method to monitor in real time the fusion of individual influenza virus particles with planar bilayers. Their results led to the conclusion that fusion requires on average three HA trimers, each of which independently undergoes the same, rate-limiting rearrangement, but they left undetermined the relationship between this conclusion and the inferred intermediates in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. In the experiments reported here, we correlate HA structure with observed variations in fusion kinetics by comparing rates for appropriate HA mutants. We conclude that irreversible engagement of fusion peptides from 3\u20134 neighboring [HA<sub>1</sub>-HA<sub>2</sub>]<sub>3</sub> trimers, within a much larger virus-target-membrane interface, leads to subsequent rearrangements that rapidly and cooperatively induce membrane merger. Release of the fusion peptide from its pocket is rate-limiting for membrane engagement. A long-lived membrane-inserted extended intermediate is a fundamental aspect of the fusion mechanism."

We followed hemifusion as a spike in individual virion fluorescence resulting from R18 fluorescence dequenching upon dilution into the target membrane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We also observed a previously undetected fusion intermediate. Upon initiating the flow of buffer for pH exchange, most virions started to move under the hydrodynamic force while retaining contacts with the target bilayer. The particles arrested at various times after the pH drop, but invariably preceding hemifusion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The arrest was irreversible (<a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2 and 3</a>). A subset (approximately 20% at pH 5.5 and 5.65) of virions had already arrested at the onset of imaging or had done so before the pH drop. For lower final pH, a larger fraction had arrested by the time the pH drop was complete (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We determined lag times between pH drop and individual virion arrest (<i>t</i><sub><i>lag</i></sub><sup>(<i>pHdrop\u2013arrest</i>)</sup>) and between arrest and hemifusion (<i>t</i><sub><i>lag</i></sub><sup>(<i>arrest\u2013hemifusion</i>)</sup>) whenever both values could be extracted from the data (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), for a range of proton concentrations between 2 and 100 \u00b5M (pH 5.65\u20134) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Mean values for <i>t</i><sub><i>lag</i></sub><sup>(<i>pHdrop\u2013arrest)</i></sup> and <i>t</i><sub><i>lag</i></sub><sup>(<i>arrest\u2013hemifusion</i>)</sup> show the same pH dependence, with mean <i>t</i><sub><i>lag</i></sub><sup>(<i>pHdrop\u2013arrest</i>)</sup> being about an order of magnitude shorter throughout the tested pH range."

Bulk experiments have shown that short incubations of virions with target membranes at pH 5 and 0\u00b0C lead to insertion of a small subset of fusion peptides and stable virus anchoring not associated with membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib42\">Tsurudome et al., 1992</a>). We attribute the majority of pre-arrested events during high pH experiments (pH 5.5 and above) to imperfections in the bilayer or defective virions; the observed increase in the immobile fraction at lower pH might result from genuine triggering and membrane insertion of HA fusion peptides upon proton binding during the pH transition (see \u2018Materials and methods')."

We used a set of plasmids derived from the A/Udorn/72 H3 influenza strain. The HA of Udorn is 97% identical in amino-acid sequence to that of X-31, the virus used in previous experiments (<a href=\"#bib11\">Floyd et al., 2008</a>) and also the source of HA in otherwise Udorn genetic background in the experiments in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. Nonetheless, recombinant virions with Udorn HA had shorter hemifusion lag times in the physiologically relevant pH regime (pH &gt; 4.5) than did those with X-31 HA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1 and 4</a>). Moreover, the Udorn-HA particles did not show directed motion under flow at any observable time point\u2014that is, they had arrested by the time the low-pH transition was complete (see \u2018Materials and methods'). The Udorn hemifusion lag time (<i>t</i><sub><i>lag</i></sub><sup>(<i>pHdrop\u2013hemifusion</i>)</sup>) distribution between pH 5.65 and 4 gave a pH-independent value of <i>N</i> close to 3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), showing that differences between Udorn and X31 HAs do not affect the number of rate-limiting steps between virion arrest and hemifusion, but only their individual rate constants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

Udorn is the only strain in the database with this substitution, glycine being otherwise universally conserved (<a href=\"#bib32\">Nobusawa et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cross et al., 2009</a>). In the pre-fusion conformation of HA, Gly4<sub>HA2</sub> participates in a network of polar hydrogen-bond interactions with the carboxylate of Asp112 <sub>HA2</sub>, which is also strictly conserved (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wilson et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Weis et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Russell et al., 2004</a>). A serine substitution would weaken or interrupt this interaction, because the glycine has a backbone conformation not allowed for other residues. Previous studies have reported an elevated pH threshold of fusion for cell-surface expressed HA harboring substitutions at Gly4 or Asp112 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gething et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Steinhauer et al., 1995</a>). Gly4<sub>HA2</sub> might also favor a tight conformation of the membrane-inserted fusion-peptide helices (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lorieau et al., 2010</a>), but its conservation does not seem critical for free fusion-peptide insertion into membranes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wharton et al., 1988</a>)."

D112A<sub>HA2</sub> mutations accelerate hemifusion of both Udorn and X31-HA virions, but the effect on the latter is more pronounced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We infer from these observations that the G4S<sub>HA2</sub> mutation partly destabilizes contacts between the terminal fusion-peptide residues and Asp112<sub>HA2</sub> and that the D112A<sub>HA2</sub> change then eliminates this source of stability completely. None of the mutations change the values of <i>N</i> derived from the pH 5.5 <i>t</i><sub><i>lag</i></sub><sup>(<i>arrest\u2013hemifusion</i>)</sup> distributions (or for static virions, <i>t</i><sub><i>lag</i></sub><sup>(<i>pHdrop\u2013hemifusion</i>)</sup> distributions) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), showing that these changes do not affect the number of steps. We conclude that for these viruses, release of the fusion peptide from its pre-fusion pocket is a rate-limiting step in the transition from arrest to hemifusion. The consistent changes in fusion kinetics produced by the mutations, including the good fit obtained from a probability distribution that assumes concomitant changes in the rates of all <i>N</i> events (see \u2018Materials and methods'), further support our proposal that <i>N</i> is related to the number of HA trimers that must independently expose their fusion peptides before a hemifusion-inducing transition can follow."

Both also result from the action of several HA trimers each undergoing this rate-limiting rearrangement as indicated by the unchanged shape of their individual lag time distributions (unchanged value of <i>N</i>) under vastly different proton concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The rate constants derived from gamma distribution fitting of the <i>t</i><sub><i>lag</i></sub><sup>(<i>pHdrop\u2013arrest</i>)</sup> data are, however, about five to tenfold greater than those for <i>t</i><sub><i>lag</i></sub><sup>(<i>arrest-hemifusion</i>)</sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), suggesting that the measured outcome in each case, arrest and hemifusion, is governed by different requirement(s).

We defined a contact patch of various sizes between 50 and 300 HAs as a circular area of hexagonally arranged trimers. Our lower-limit estimate of a contact area that can accommodate up to about 50 HA trimers, shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, is based on dimensions of a spherical virion with 55 nm in membrane-to-membrane diameter (<a href=\"#bib1\">Calder et al., 2010</a>). Virions used in our current experiments are on average approximately 130 nm long and 55 nm wide (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ivanovic et al., 2012</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods'), and thus the actual contact area can on average accommodate up to about 120 HA trimers.

In the latter case, measurements of conductance and capacitance showed reversible opening and closing of flickering pores, following initial acidification and commitment to secure pore opening only after a number of seconds. Good evidence that several HAs participate in pore formation came from red-blood cell fusion experiments in which the surface concentration of HA in the expressing cells varied over a roughly thirteenfold range (<a href=\"#bib7\">Danieli et al., 1996</a>). Hill-plot treatment of the fusion times led to an estimate of 3\u20134 HAs per fusion event. A limitation of any cell\u2013cell fusion experiment is the large contact zone and hence some ambiguity concerning the number of independent, local fusion events that occur in any one observation. Single-virion fusion experiments confirmed the earlier estimate of 3\u20134 HAs and showed that lipid-mixing precedes content mixing, as expected for an obligatory hemifusion intermediate (<a href=\"#bib11\">Floyd et al., 2008</a>). In that work, the single, rate-limiting step for content mixing had a rate constant of about 0.05/s."

The pathway with the lowest energy barrier appears to be through a so-called \u2018hemifusion stalk', derived from the apposed leaflets (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kuzmin et al., 2001</a>). Some proposals for the subsequent transition to a fusion pore postulate expansion of the stalk into a \u2018hemifusion diaphragm', in which the distal leaflets form a continuous bilayer between the two membrane-bounded compartments; others suggest that a stalk can open directly into a pore. Hemifusion diaphragms can be seen by electron microscopy (e.g., <a href=\"#bib16\">Hernandez et al., 2012</a>); evidence for stalk-like structures comes from x-ray analysis of crystalline lipid phases (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yang and Huang, 2002</a>). Both calculations and observations suggest that hemifusion diaphragms are stable, long-lived intermediates and that their formation might be a dead-end side reaction. Recent work on calcium-triggered SNARE/synaptotagmin/complexin-mediated fusion of lipid vesicles on a physiological time scale shows that the reaction proceeds too quickly (&lt;100 ms) to detect even a hemifusion intermediate and that fusion from a hemifusion diaphragm is slow (tens of seconds) and inefficient (<a href=\"#bib9\">Diao et al., 2012</a>). In influenza-virus fusion, tight packing of proteins on the viral surface probably makes a transition from stalk or other point-contact intermediate to diaphragm even less likely than in SNARE-mediated fusion, in which protein coverage of the fusing membranes is sparser."

The experiments report on conformational rearrangements in the catalyst (HA); their interpretation does not depend on the details of membrane organization in the substrates (the hemifusing membranes). They provide strong evidence for a long-lived, extended HA intermediate and for a rapid and cooperative transition to lipid mixing when a critical number of these intermediates has accumulated within a contact neighborhood.

Binding to sialic-acid-containing glycans is weak, and local forces, such as flow, can displace the particle (either by \u2018rolling', with dissociation at the rear edge accompanied by new attachments at the front, or by translation across the membrane surface together with any associated lipids). The contact region between a virus particle and the target membrane is relatively large (probably 50\u2013150 HA trimers, depending on the particle morphology: see comments above and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> caption). Any fusion peptide released within this area of contact and inserted into the target membrane will contribute to resisting buffer flow; the probability of arrest is then the probability for fusion-peptide exposure and insertion from 3\u20134 trimers within the area of membrane contact. Because hemifusion requires that fusion peptides of 3\u20134 adjacent trimers insert into the target membrane, the apparent rate constant for hemifusion relates to a different probability\u2014that of inserting fusion peptides from several neighboring HAs. The data suggest that HA trimers independently undergo the first part of their low-pH-induced conformational change and pause as extended intermediates with their fusion peptides inserted into the target membrane. Capture by the target membrane restrains a trimer from collapsing to induce hemifusion until 2\u20133 neighbors help generate sufficient pull to deform the membrane. This interpretation also argues that when these conditions have been met, the final HA rearrangements are fast and cooperative."

The accumulation of <i>N</i> extended HA<sub>2</sub> neighbors, each fluctuating toward a more stable, fully collapsed conformation while pulling against the elastic restoring force of the two membranes, will lead to an abrupt and cooperative event, when the critical <i>N</i>th molecule joins the cluster (rather like the abrupt consequence of adding a new member to the team on one side of a previously balanced tug-of-war). Evidence for the rapidity of the final HA rearrangements comes from the results of our simulation and gamma distribution analysis and the sensitivity of the derived rate constant to the mutations we have introduced. Any additional steps, not directly sensitive to those mutations, must be faster than any one of the steps of fusion-peptide engagement with the target membrane."

For an intermediate to form that resembles the inner core of the ultimate, low-pH triggered structure (as drawn for the extended structure in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), the HA<sub>1</sub> heads must dissociate from their contact with an HA<sub>2</sub> loop (HA<sub>2</sub> residues 58\u201374: see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) between the short first \u03b1-helix (HA<sub>2</sub>, residues 38\u201357) and the long central \u03b1-helix (HA<sub>2</sub>, residues 75\u2013127) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Godley et al., 1992</a>), and that loop must in turn reverse direction and become itself a helix. Extension of the central trimeric coiled-coil probably drives the latter process, as the amino-acid sequence of the loop strongly favors such a conformation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Carr and Kim, 1993</a>). Further necessary structural changes, in addition to release of the fusion peptide from its pocket, are dissociation of two strands (HA<sub>2</sub>, residues 21\u201338) from the edge of the small \u03b2-sheet near the base of the HA trimer and displacement outward of this segment of HA<sub>2</sub> along with the short first helix, which could unfold and refold as it adds to the extending, central helical coiled-coil. The structure thus pictured would project the fusion peptide no more than about 25 \u00c5 beyond the palisade of un-triggered HAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A and 6</a>), even if the HA<sub>2</sub> segment that will fold back against the central core remains roughly in its pre-fusion state (again, as drawn for the extended structure in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Our results show that breaking the interactions that restrain the fusion peptide is rate-limiting both for virion arrest and for hemifusion at the pH of endosomes from which influenza virus penetrates (approximately 5 to 5.5); this interpretation is consistent with the dominance hierarchy of mutations that influence the threshold pH for fusion (<a href=\"#bib40\">Steinhauer et al., 1996</a>). Mutations that affect the pH dependence of fusion map to a number of sites distributed across the HA<sub>2</sub> trimer interface (<a href=\"#bib8\">Daniels et al., 1985</a>). Changes in the stability of this interface will influence fluctuations from the equilibrium structure and hence the \u2018window of opportunity' for the fusion peptide to withdraw productively from its pocket. Emergence of the fusion peptide can in principle precede the other events, which then must follow rapidly (or the peptide will reinsert); perhaps more frequently, extension of the central coiled-coil by residues 20\u201374 may exert a \u2018tug' to extract the fusion peptide.

Their stability is critical for viral transmission, not only in the passage from one host or cell to another, but also during entry, as fusion will be relatively unproductive if it occurs before the pH of the surrounding compartment has dropped enough to allow M2-mediated acidification of the particle interior (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ivanovic et al., 2012</a>), which induces dissociation of the eight ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) of the viral genome from the matrix protein, M1 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Martin and Helenius, 1991</a>).

Thus, a relatively long-lived extended intermediate could prove to be a clinically useful target for an influenza-virus entry inhibitor: the inherent lower limit to the stability of the pre-fusion HA combined with the requirement for the coordinated action of multiple, independently-triggered HAs to induce fusion, curbs the ability of a virus to escape such treatment by mutations that accelerate fusion-inducing rearrangements."

For HIV fusion, the results of timing-of-inhibitor-addition experiments (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gallo et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Miyauchi et al., 2009</a>), the low surface density of the HIV-envelope protein (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chertova et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zhu et al., 2003</a>), and the indication, from experiments with virions bearing mixtures of active and inactive spikes, that one HIV-envelope trimer may be sufficient to mediate fusion (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yang et al., 2005</a>), have led to the inference that a single, trimeric gp41 mediates fusion through a very slow fold-back transition. The data presented here for influenza HA show that there can be a long-lived species, analogous to the extended form of gp41, even when the fold-back transition itself is fast. We suggest that the long delay between HIV binding and membrane fusion may reflect a sequence of events similar to those in our model for influenza virus fusion. In other words, we propose that HIV fusion may require recruitment of (at least) a second envelope trimer, following attachment of the first. The delay time would then be a combination of the time needed to recruit one or more additional envelope proteins and the time needed to activate them with CD4 and a coreceptor. Extensions of the approaches taken here to HIV and other viruses will be necessary to probe the true similarities and differences among them."

In some cases, we cannot unambiguously distinguish between (1) virion arrest due to virion or bilayer defects, such as presence of virion-associated denatured HA or parts of the target bilayer that are not continuous with the rest of the membrane surface (e.g., remaining unfused liposomes), and (2) genuine HA triggering and membrane insertion that precede completion of the pH drop and might even occur with low frequency at neutral pH. One reason for this limitation is that virion movement under hydrodynamic force is somewhat retarded at neutral pH even in the context of X31-HA WT virions (<a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>); upon pH drop, X31-HA WT virions initially accelerate and then arrest (<a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). HA triggering and membrane insertion at neutral pH is probably a rare event for all virions analyzed in this study but one that might occur more frequently for Udorn WT and other virions with a destabilized HA. Indeed, we occasionally observe hemifusion at neutral pH even with X31-HA WT virions (see <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>)."

Harrison, van Oijen, and collaborators developed a single-virion fusion assay four years ago to observe the sequence of events that lead to hemifusion (lipid mixing) and complete fusion (content mixing) induced by influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) upon a controlled pH drop. In the present work they further developed the assay to also monitor the time it takes for individual virions to stably dock to a supported bilayer (referred to as \u201carrest\u201d). Furthermore, the assay was streamlined in order to test a number of strategic mutations of HA."

The single-virion fusion data suggest that the kinetics of both virion arrest and hemifusion are accelerated by the destabilizing mutations, while the apparent number of events (\u223c3 trimers) remains unchanged. This result illustrates that release of the fusion peptide from its pocket is rate-limiting for virion arrest and hemifusion, and it is consistent with a model of an extended HA intermediate that bridges membranes prior to a further conformational change that leads to hemifusion."

The steps leading to virion arrest may well be described by a gamma distribution because one starts with a large number of trimers and fusion peptide release of the first few would occur with essentially the same global rate.

We had originally included this measurement in Table 1, and we have now added a sentence in the Materials and methods further discussing these percentages. We also added a sentence about the relative efficiency of arrest, which was nearly 100% up to the highest pH analyzed (pH 5.65). At pH 5.65 we observe a small subset of virions that continue to move under hydrodynamic force well after the pH drop, but in this case also nearly 100% seem to arrest within a few minutes of pH drop. We cannot estimate the exact percentage of those virions that never arrest or that arrest very late, because we do not have a way to automatically detect and track the virions that never arrest, but careful observation of the movies in slow motion allowed us to conclude that \u223c100% of virions do arrest at all the pHs we analyzed."

We have done the simulation, added a new figure (now Figure 5), and we have added a new section to the Results (titled \u2018<i>Simulation of molecular events in the contact patch between virion and target membrane'</i>). Briefly, we have generated a computer simulation of our predicted model that virion arrest results from independent triggering and irreversible membrane insertion from several HA trimers <i>anywhere</i> at the target membrane interface, and that hemifusion is limited by the same molecular rearrangements, fusion peptide release, and membrane insertion, but requires participation of <i>neighboring</i> HA trimers, and is thus related to a different probability. This exercise not only supported our original contention but narrowed down our interpretation of results, allowing us to state that virion arrest results from 3\u20134 trimers inserting into the target membrane anywhere in the contact patch and hemifusion from 3\u20134 <i>neighboring</i> HA trimers undergoing the same molecular rearrangement.
