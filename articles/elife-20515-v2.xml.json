Recordings reveal that the frequency of these oscillations \u2013 the number of cycles of a wave per second, measured in Hertz \u2013 can vary between brain regions, and within a single region over time. Moreover, oscillations with different frequencies can co-exist and interact with one another."

Theta waves are relatively slow waves, with a frequency between 5 and 10 Hertz. Gamma waves are faster, with a frequency of up to 100 Hertz. Recent work has suggested that gamma waves and theta waves show a phenomenon called phase-phase coupling. Since gamma waves are faster than theta waves, multiple cycles of gamma can occur during a single cycle of theta. Phase-phase coupling is the idea that gamma and theta waves align themselves, such that gamma waves always begin at the same relative position within a theta wave. This was thought to help the hippocampus to encode memories."

The new results suggest that previous reports describing the phenomenon may have relied on inadequate statistical techniques. Using stringent control analyses, Scheffer-Teixeira and Tort find no evidence for prominent theta-gamma phase-phase coupling in the hippocampus. Instead, the simulations suggest that what appeared to be statistically significant coupling may in reality be an artifact of the previous analysis."

Standard phase coherence measures the constancy of the phase difference between two oscillations of the same frequency (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lachaux et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hurtado et al., 2004</a>), and has been associated with cognitive processes such as decision-making (<a href=\"#bib13\">DeCoteau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Montgomery and Buzs\u00e1ki, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">N\u00e1cher et al., 2013</a>). Similarly to coherence, cross-frequency phase\u2013phase coupling, or n:m phase-locking, also relies on assessing the constancy of the difference between two phase time series (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tass et al., 1998</a>). However, in this case the original phase time series are accelerated, so that their instantaneous frequencies can match.

To that end, we simulated a system of two Kuramoto oscillators \u2013 a \u2018theta\u2019 and a \u2018gamma\u2019 oscillator \u2013 exhibiting variability in instantaneous frequency (see Materials and methods). The mean natural frequency of the theta oscillator was set to 8 Hz, while the mean natural frequency of the gamma oscillator was set to 43 Hz (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). When coupled, the mean frequencies aligned to a 1:5 factor by changing to 8.5 Hz and 42.5 Hz, respectively (see <a href=\"#bib18\">Guevara and Glass, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Garc\u00eda-Alvarez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Canavier et al., 2009</a>). <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> depicts three versions of accelerated theta phases (m\u00a0=\u00a03, 5 and 7) along with the instantaneous gamma phase (n\u00a0=\u00a01) of the coupled oscillators (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for the uncoupled case).

The concentration (or \u2018constancy\u2019) of the phase difference distribution is used as a metric of n:m phase-locking.

We band-pass filtered white-noise signals to extract the instantaneous phase of theta (\u03b8: 4\u201312 Hz) and of multiple gamma bands (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>): slow gamma (\u03b3<sub>S</sub>: 30\u201350 Hz), middle gamma (\u03b3<sub>M</sub>: 50\u201390 Hz), and fast gamma (\u03b3<sub>F</sub>: 90\u2013150 Hz).

For instance, for dt\u00a0=\u00a01 ms (1000 Hz sampling rate), consecutive samples of white noise filtered between 4 and 12 Hz are likely to exhibit phase difference of 0.05 rad (8 Hz center frequency); likewise, signals filtered between 30 and 50 Hz are likely to exhibit phase differences of 0.25 rad (40 Hz center frequency). In turn, the \u2018sinusoidality\u2019 imposed by filtering leads to non-zero R<sub>n:m</sub> values, which peak at the ratio of the center frequencies, akin to the fact that perfect 8 Hz and 40 Hz sine waves have R<sub>n:m</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01 at n:m\u00a0=\u00a01:5. In accordance to this explanation, no R<sub>n:m</sub> bump occurs when data points of the gamma phase time series are made independent by sub-sampling with a period longer than a gamma cycle (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), or when extracting phase values from different trials (not shown).

The \u2018<i>Original</i>\u2019 R<sub>n:m</sub> value uses the same time window for extracting theta and gamma phases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, upper panel). A \u2018<i>Time Shift</i>\u2019 procedure for creating surrogate epochs has been previously employed (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belluscio et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zheng et al., 2016</a>), in which the time window for gamma phase is randomly shifted between 1 to 200 ms from the time window for theta phase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, upper middle panel). A variant of this procedure is the \u2018<i>Random Permutation</i>\u2019, in which the time window for gamma phase is randomly chosen (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, lower middle panel). Finally, in the \u2018<i>Phase Scramble</i>\u2019 procedure, the timestamps of the gamma phase time series are shuffled (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, lower panel); clearly, the latter is the least conservative. For each surrogate procedure, R<sub>n:m</sub> values were obtained by two approaches: \u2018<i>Single Run</i>\u2019 and \u2018<i>Pooled</i>\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In the first approach, each surrogate run (e.g., a time shift or a random selection of time windows) produces one R<sub>n:m</sub> value (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, top panels).

As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, R<sub>n:m</sub> computed from a pool of surrogate runs is much smaller than when computed for each individual run. This is due to the dependence of R<sub>n:m</sub> on the epoch length: pooling instantaneous phase differences across 10 runs of 1 s surrogate epochs is equivalent to analyzing a single surrogate epoch of 10 s. And the longer the analyzed epoch, the more the noise is averaged out and the lower the R<sub>n:m</sub>. Therefore, pooled surrogate epochs summing up to 10 s of total data have lower R<sub>n:m</sub> than any individual 1 s surrogate epoch."

This was true for surrogate epochs of any length, although the longer the epoch, the lower the actual and the surrogate R<sub>n:m</sub> values, as expected (compare right and left panels of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). <i>Pooled</i> R<sub>1:5</sub> distributions derived from either time-shifted (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) or randomly permutated epochs (not shown) also led to the detection of false positive \u03b8\u2212\u03b3<sub>S</sub> phase-phase coupling.

On the other hand, coupled oscillators have high R<sub>n:m</sub> because variations of their instantaneous frequencies are mutually dependent. We then proceeded to analyze simulated LFPs from a previously published model network (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kopell et al., 2010</a>).

Due to the non-sinusoidal shape of theta (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belluscio et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sheremet et al., 2016</a>), the LFP also exhibited spectral peaks at harmonic frequencies (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We constructed phase\u2013phase plots using LFP components narrowly filtered at theta and its harmonics: 14, 21, 28 and 35 Hz. Similarly to the sawtooth wave (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), the phase-phase plots exhibited diagonal stripes whose number was determined by the harmonic order (i.e., the 1<sup>st</sup> harmonic exhibited two stripes, the second harmonic three stripes, the third, four stripes and the fourth, five stripes; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7Bi\u2013iv</a>). Interestingly, when the LFP was filtered at a broad gamma band (30\u201390 Hz), we observed five diagonal stripes, the same number as when narrowly filtering at 35 Hz; moreover, both gamma and 35 Hz filtered signals exhibited the exact same phase lag (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7Biv\u2013v</a>). Therefore, these results indicate that the diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots may be influenced by theta harmonics. Under this interpretation, signals filtered at the gamma band would be likely to exhibit as many stripes as expected for the first theta harmonic falling within the filtered band. Consistent with this possibility, we found that the peak frequency of theta relates to the number of stripes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, phase-phase plots constructed from filtered white-noise signals also displayed diagonal stripes. Since white noise has no harmonics, these results show that the sinusoidality induced by the filter can by itself lead to diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots, in the same way that it leads to a bump in the R<sub>n:m</sub> curve (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To test this possibility, we next revisited the significance of phase-phase plots of actual LFPs. For epochs of up to 100 s, we found similar results as in white noise, namely, bin counts were no longer statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (Holm-Bonferroni method); this was true when using either the <i>Time Shift</i> or <i>Random Permutation</i> procedures (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Surprisingly, however, when analyzing much longer time series (10 or 20 min of concatenated periods of REM sleep), several bin counts became statistically significant when compared to randomly permutated, but not time-shifted, surrogates (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Moreover, this result reflected in the R<sub>n:m</sub> curves: the <i>Original</i> R<sub>n:m</sub> curve fell within the distribution of <i>Time Shift/Single Run</i> surrogate R<sub>n:m</sub> values for all analyzed lengths, but outside the distribution of <i>Random Permutation/Single Run</i> surrogates for the longer time series (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). We believe such a finding relates to what we observed for synthetic sawtooth waves, in which <i>Random Permutation</i> was more sensitive than <i>Time Shift</i> to detect the significance of the artifactual coupling caused by waveform asymmetry (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In this sense, the n:m phase-locking between fundamental and harmonic frequencies would persist for small time shifts (\u00b1200 ms), albeit in different phase relations, while it would not resist the much larger time shifts obtained through random permutations. However, irrespective of this explanation, it should be noted that since the n:m phase-locking metrics cannot separate artifactual from true coupling, the possibility of the latter cannot be discarded. But if this is the case, we consider unlikely that the very low coupling level (~0.03) would have any physiological significance."

Theta and gamma are well known to interact by means of phase-amplitude coupling, in which the instantaneous gamma amplitude waxes and wanes as a function of theta phase (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bragin et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Caixeta et al., 2013</a>). This particular type of cross-frequency coupling has been receiving large attention and related to functional roles (<a href=\"#bib10\">Canolty and Knight, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hyafil et al., 2015</a>). In addition to phase-amplitude coupling, theta and gamma oscillations can potentially interact in many other ways (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jensen and Colgin, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hyafil et al., 2015</a>). For example, the power of slow gamma oscillations may be inversely related to theta power (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tort et al., 2008</a>), suggesting amplitude-amplitude coupling. Recently, it has been reported that theta and gamma in hippocampal LFPs would also couple by means of n:m phase-locking (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belluscio et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zheng and Zhang, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Xu et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zheng et al., 2016</a>).

However, our results show a\u00a0lack of convincing evidence for n:m phase-locking in the two hippocampal datasets analyzed here, and further suggest that previous work may have spuriously detected phase-phase coupling due to an improper use of surrogate methods, a concern also raised for phase-amplitude coupling (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aru et al., 2015</a>)."

                                "text": "When searching for phase-phase coupling between theta and gamma, we noticed that our R<sub>n:m</sub> values differed from those reported in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belluscio et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Xu et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zheng et al., 2016</a>). We suspected that this could be due to differences in the duration of the analyzed epochs. We then investigated the dependence of R<sub>n:m</sub> on epoch length, and found a strong positive bias for shorter epochs. In addition, R<sub>n:m</sub> values exhibit greater variability across samples as epoch length decreases for both white noise and actual data (e.g., compare\u00a0in\u00a0<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> the\u00a0data dispersion in <i>Original</i> R<sub>1:5</sub> or R<sub>1:8</sub> boxplots for different epoch lengths). Since theta and gamma peak frequencies are not constant in these signals, the longer the epoch, the more the theta and gamma peak frequencies are allowed to fluctuate and the more apparent the lack of coupling. On the other hand, <math id=\"inf23\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><msub><mrow><mi>\u03c6</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math> distribution becomes less uniform for shorter epochs. The dependence of n:m phase-coupling metrics on epoch length has important implications in designing surrogate epochs for testing the statistical significance of actual R<sub>n:m</sub> values. Of note, methodological studies on 1:1 phase-synchrony have properly used single surrogate runs of the same length as the original signal (<a href=\"#bib31\">Le Van Quyen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hurtado et al., 2004</a>). As demonstrated here, spurious detection of phase-phase coupling may occur if surrogate epochs are longer than the original epoch. This is the case when one lumps together several surrogate epochs before computing R<sub>n:m</sub>. When employing proper controls, our results show that R<sub>n:m</sub> values of real data do not differ from surrogate values in theta epochs of up to 100 s. Moreover, the prominent bump in the R<sub>n:m</sub> curve disappears when subsampling data at a lower frequency than gamma for both white noise and hippocampal LFPs (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s7\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 7</a>), which suggests that it is due to the statistical dependence among contiguous data points introduced by the filter (which we referred to as \u2018filtering-induced sinusoidality\u2019)."

While constructing surrogate data renders the metric computationally more expensive, such an issue is not specific for measuring n:m phase-locking but also happens for other metrics commonly used in the analysis of neurophysiological data, such as coherence, spike-field coupling, phase-amplitude coupling, mutual information and directionality measures, among many others (<a href=\"#bib31\">Le Van Quyen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hurtado et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Pereda et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tort et al., 2010</a>)."

Two studies (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belluscio et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zheng et al., 2016</a>) statistically inferred the existence of n:m phase-locking by comparing empirical phase-phase plots with those obtained from the average of 1000 time-shifted surrogate runs. Specifically, <a href=\"#bib3\">Belluscio et al. (2012)</a> established a significance threshold for each phase-phase bin based on the mean and standard deviation of individual surrogate counts in that bin, and showed that the bin counts leading to diagonal stripes were statistically significant. Here we were able to replicate these results (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). However, we note that a phase-phase bin count is not a metric of n:m phase-locking; it does not inform coupling strength and even coupled oscillators have bins with non-significant counts. A bin count would be analogous to a phase difference vector (<math id=\"inf24\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><msub><mrow><mi>\u03c6</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow></mstyle></math>), which is also not a metric of n:m phase-locking per se, but used to compute one. That is, in the same way that the R<sub>n:m</sub> considers all phase difference vectors, n:m phase-locking can only be inferred when considering all bin counts in a phase-phase plot. In this sense, by analyzing the phase-phase plot as a whole, it was assumed that the appearance diagonal stripes was due to theta-gamma coupling; no such stripes were apparent in phase-phase plots constructed from the average over all surrogate runs (see\u00a0Figure\u00a06A in <a href=\"#bib3\">Belluscio et al., 2012</a>). However, here we showed that single time-shifted surrogate runs do exhibit diagonal stripes (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), that is, similar stripes exist at the level of a <i>Single Run</i> surrogate analysis, in the same way that <i>Single Run</i> surrogates also exhibit a bump in the R<sub>n:m</sub> curve. Averaging 1000 surrogate phase-phase plots destroys the diagonal stripes since different time shifts lead to different phase lags. Moreover, since the average is the sum divided by a scaling factor (the sample size), computing the average phase-phase plot is equivalent to computing a single phase-phase plot using the pool of all surrogate runs, which is akin to the issue of computing a single R<sub>n:m</sub> value from a pooled surrogate distribution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Note that even bin counts in phase-phase plots of white noise are considered significant under the statistical analysis introduced in <a href=\"#bib3\">Belluscio et al. (2012)</a> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Nevertheless, this was no longer the case when adapting their original framework to include a Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>)."

                                "text": "Here we showed that the presence of diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots is not sufficient to conclude the existence of phase-phase coupling. The diagonal stripes are simply a visual manifestation of a maintained phase relationship, and as such they essentially reflect what R<sub>n:m</sub> measures: that is, the \u2018clearer\u2019 the stripes, the higher the R<sub>n:m</sub>. Therefore, in addition to true coupling, the same confounding factors that influence R<sub>n:m</sub> also influence phase-phase plots, such as filtering-induced sinusoidality and frequency harmonics. Our results suggest that the former is a main factor, because white-noise signals have no harmonics but nevertheless display stripes in phase-phase plots (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). In accordance, no stripes are observed in phase-phase plots of white noise when subsampling the time series (<a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, in actual LFPs filtering is not the only influence: (1) for the same filtered gamma band (30\u201350 Hz), the number of stripes relates to theta frequency (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>); (2) for very long time series (i.e., 10\u201320 min of concatenated data), the stripes in phase-phase plots of actual data \u2013 but not of white noise \u2013 persist after correcting for multiple comparisons when employing <i>Random Permutation/Single Run</i> surrogates (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>); (3) a striped-like pattern remains in phase-phase plots of actual LFPs after subsampling the time series (<a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Consistently, R<sub>n:m</sub> values of actual LFPs are greater than those of white noise in 1200 s epochs (~0.03 vs\u00a0~0.005, compare the bottom right panels of <a href=\"#fig9\">Figures 9B</a> and <a href=\"#fig10\">10B</a>). Interestingly, <i>Original</i> R<sub>n:m</sub> values of actual LFPs are not statistically different from the distribution of <i>Time Shift/Single Run</i> surrogates even for the very long epochs (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>), which suggests that <i>Random Permutation</i> is more powerful than <i>Time Shift</i> and should therefore be preferred. Though a very weak but true coupling effect cannot be discarded, based on our analysis of sawtooth waves (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we believe these results can be explained by theta harmonics, which would remain phase-locked to the fundamental frequency under small time shifts. Sharp signal deflections have been previously recognized to generate artifactual phase-amplitude coupling (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kramer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tort et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aru et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lozano-Soldevilla et al., 2016</a>). Interestingly, <a href=\"#bib22\">Hyafil (2015)</a> recently suggested that the non-sinusoidality of alpha waves could underlie the 1:2 phase-locking between alpha and beta observed in human EEG (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nikulin and Brismar, 2006</a>; see also <a href=\"#bib44\">Palva et al., 2005</a>). To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no metric capable of automatically distinguishing true cross-frequency coupling from waveform-induced artifacts in collective signals such as LFP, EEG and MEG signals. Ideally, learning how the signal is generated from the activity of different neuronal populations would answer whether true cross-frequency coupling exists or not (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hyafil et al., 2015</a>), but unfortunately this is methodologically challenging."

We disagree with these arguments for the following reasons: (1) we could reproduce our results using a second dataset from an independent laboratory (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), and (2) we examined the same behavioral states in which n:m phase-locking was reported to occur (active waking and REM sleep). One could also argue that there exists multiple gammas, and that different gamma types are most prominent in different hippocampal layers (<a href=\"#bib11\">Colgin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tort et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Schomburg et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Laszt\u00f3czi and Klausberger, 2014</a>); therefore, prominent theta-gamma phase-phase coupling could exist in other hippocampal layers not investigated here. We also disagree with this possibility because: (1) we examined the same hippocampal layer in which theta-gamma phase-phase coupling was reported to occur (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belluscio et al., 2012</a>); moreover, (2) we found similar results in all hippocampal layers (we recorded LFPs using 16-channel silicon probes, see Materials and methods) (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) and (3) in parietal and entorhinal cortex recordings (not shown). Furthermore, similar results hold when (4) filtering LFPs within any gamma sub-band (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> to 6), (5) analyzing CSD signals (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), or (6) analyzing independent components that maximize activity within particular gamma sub-bands (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schomburg et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Finally, one could argue that gamma oscillations are not continuous but transient, and that assessing phase-phase coupling between theta and transient gamma bursts would require a different type of analysis than employed here. Regarding this argument, we once again stress that we used the exact same methodology as originally used to detect theta-gamma phase-phase coupling (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belluscio et al., 2012</a>). Nevertheless, we also ran analysis only taking into account periods in which gamma amplitude was\u00a0&gt;2 SD above the mean (\u2018gamma bursts\u2019) and found no statistically significant phase-phase coupling (<a href=\"#fig5s6\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 6</a>)."

In this sense, and to the best of our knowledge, none of previous research investigating theta-gamma phase-phase coupling has properly tested R<sub>n:m</sub> against chance. Many studies have focused on comparing changes in n:m phase-locking levels, but we believe these can be influenced by other variables such as changes in power, which affect the signal-to-noise ratio and consequently also the estimation of the phase time series. Interestingly, in their pioneer work, Tass and colleagues used filtered white noise to construct surrogate distributions and did not find significant n:m phase-locking among brain oscillations (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tass et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2003</a>). On the other hand, it is theoretically possible that n:m phase-locking exists but can only be detected by other types of metrics yet to be devised. In any case, our work shows that there is currently no convincing evidence for genuine theta-gamma phase-phase coupling using the same phase-locking metric (R<sub>n:m</sub>) as employed in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belluscio et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zheng and Zhang, 2013</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib63\">Xu et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Stujenske et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zheng et al., 2016</a>), at least when examining LFP epochs of up to 100 s of prominent theta activity. For longer epoch lengths, though, we did find that R<sub>n:m</sub> values of hippocampal LFPs may actually differ from those of randomly permuted, but not time-shifted, surrogates (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). While we tend to ascribe such result to the effect of theta harmonics, we note that the possibility of true coupling cannot be discarded. But we are particularly skeptical that the very low levels of coupling strength observed in long LFP epochs would be physiologically meaningful."

In the case of phase-amplitude coupling, the modulation of gamma amplitude within theta cycles would instruct a reader network when the string of items represented in different gamma cycles starts and terminates. On the other hand, the precise ordering of gamma cycles within theta cycles that is consistent across theta cycles would imply phase-phase coupling; indeed, n:m phase-locking is a main feature of computational models of sequence coding by theta-gamma coupling (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lisman and Idiart, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jensen and Lisman, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jensen et al., 1996</a>). In contrast to these models, however, our results show that the theta phases in which gamma cycles begin/end are not fixed across theta cycles, which is to say that gamma cycles are not precisely timed but rather drift; in other words, gamma is not a clock (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burns et al., 2011</a>)."

We believe that the\u00a0evidence in favor of n:m phase-locking in other brain regions and signals could potentially also be explained by simpler effects (e.g., filtering-induced sinusoidality, asymmetrical waveform, and improper statistical tests). While no current technique can differentiate spurious from true phase-phase coupling, previous findings should be revisited and, whenever suitable, checked against the confounding factors and the more conservative surrogate procedures outlined here."

Phase-phase plots were obtained by first binning theta and gamma phases into 120 bins and next constructing 2D histograms of phase counts, which were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel of \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a010 bins."

This distinction may be hard to make at the macroscopic level (LFP/EEG) and could rather be searched for in how this signal is generated from the activity of distinct neural subpopulations. If the same gamma oscillations that are shown to phase-lock to theta oscillations can be dissociated neurally from theta oscillations (and indeed the authors did a tremendous job in previous publications at showing that hippocampal theta and gamma rely on distinct interconnected networks), then the evidence is rather of favor of genuine n:m locking. In the converse case, if no population selectively engaged in the faster oscillation can be identified, I would say that the asymmetrical oscillation is the most plausible explanation."

By contrast, it seems that here \u2013 not quite clear in the text \u2013 surrogates for distinct time shifts were merged before counts were done in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (i.e. Pooled analysis, which of course averages the count and creates many false positives).

If this is the case, that would provide statistically sound evidence for n:m coupling (asymmetrical theta being still a possible confound).

I tend to defend the alternative option (clearly here I do not refer to the analysis of Mean Phase-Phase Plot, which the authors have convincingly showed that is flawed, but to the tests on phase counts; I also want to reassure the authors that I really do not have any personal motivation to go one way or the other). My intuition is that the presence of one single significant count in the phase-phase plot, if appropriately controlled for multiple comparisons, would provide a valid statistical measure. In essence it would not simply detect the presence of stripes (which surrogate run also feature) but measure whether their amplitude is larger than those of surrogates. This could be shown in a quite straightforward way by looking whether significant points in phase-phase plots obtained from white noise persist when a correction for multiple comparisons is applied. The authors seem to agree that they would not. (As for the type of correction, the Bonferroni method that the authors refer to looks too conservative as the bin counts clearly are non-independent; less stringent correction such as FDR or Holm-Bonferroni may be preferred). A count is not a metric for n:m coupling for sure, but it can inform of the particular concentration of the high frequency phase at one specific phase of the high frequency phase. More importantly, what matters here is not a metric of the coupling strength, but a reliable statistical test that selectively detects coupling, and my intuition is that counts in the phase-phase plot may provide one. If a simple correction can be applied to give a sound statistical test, this could allow Belluscio and colleagues to look back at their data and see whether the significant counts indeed resist correction for multiple comparisons."

So in my opinion here the effect is rather due to the temporary n:m alignment of phases, just as for white noise.

However, as established by theoretical studies of coupled oscillators, n:m coupling is not a fixed property of the network but emerges as a combination of oscillator intrinsic dynamics and the characteristics of the connectivity pattern. See for example Arnold tongue: if we assume there is just one fixed gamma, a fluctuating theta and fixed connectivity, it is perfectly normal that n:m coupling will shift from 1:5 to 1:4 if the lower oscillator accelerates and the ratio of frequency goes from around 5 to around 4."

Instead of assuming that theta would couple to a genuine 1:5 gamma (i.e., 5 gamma cycles per theta cycle) and to a genuine 1:4 gamma (4 gamma cycles per theta cycle), we believe the stripes are straightforwardly explained by the fact that theta frequency in 8A example is 7.1 Hz while in 8B theta frequency is 8.4 Hz; therefore, it takes a factor of 5 and 4, respectively, to make these theta frequencies larger than the low cutoff frequency of the gamma filter (i.e., 7.1 Hz x 5 = 35.5 Hz &gt; 30 Hz and 8.4 x 4 = 33.6 Hz &gt; 30 Hz), which would explain why we see 5 and 4 stripes, respectively. Believing in two different and genuine gamma activities \u2013 one coupled at 5 cycles per theta, the other at 4 cycles per theta \u2013 would go against the parsimonious principle."

In this sense, we don\u2019t see a single histogram count as a metric of n:m phase-locking, in the same way that we don\u2019t see a single vector of phase difference (<math id=\"inf37\"><mrow><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mi>\ufffd</mi><msub><mtext>\u03c6</mtext><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow></math>) as a metric of n:m phase-locking, simply because neither a single histogram count nor a single phase difference vector measures the level of n:m phase-locking between the time series. Rather, for each single surrogate run, a metric of n:m phase-locking is obtained by computing the length of the mean vector over all phase difference vectors (R<sub>n:m</sub>). Therefore, sticking to this analogy, the counts in phase-phase plots would correspond to the phase difference vectors used to compute the R<sub>n:m</sub>, but not to the R<sub>n:m</sub> metric itself. Again, a count is not an n:m phase-locking metric. In the case of the phase-phase plot, a Single Run surrogate would be an entire phase-phase plot constructed from a single surrogate (i.e., time-shifted) time series, because it is at this level that we infer the existence of n:m phase-locking \u2013 and not at the level of a single bin count. In other words, Belluscio et al. inferred the existence of n:m phase-locking by the visual inspection of stripes. And, as shown in <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, phase-phase plots from single surrogate runs do exhibit stripes similar to the original phase-phase plot.

I tend to defend the alternative option (clearly here I do not refer to the analysis of Mean Phase-Phase Plot, which the authors have convincingly showed that is flawed, but to the tests on phase counts; I also want to reassure the authors that I really do not have any personal motivation to go one way or the other). My intuition is that the presence of one single significant count in the phase-phase plot, if appropriately controlled for multiple comparisons, would provide a valid statistical measure. In essence it would not simply detect the presence of stripes (which surrogate run also feature) but measure whether their amplitude is larger than those of surrogates. This could be shown in a quite straightforward way by looking whether significant points in phase-phase plots obtained from white noise persist when a correction for multiple comparisons is applied. The authors seem to agree that they would not. (As for the type of correction, the Bonferroni method that the authors refer to looks too conservative as the bin counts clearly are non-independent; less stringent correction such as FDR or Holm-Bonferroni may be preferred). A count is not a metric for n:m coupling for sure, but it can inform of the particular concentration of the high frequency phase at one specific phase of the high frequency phase. More importantly, what matters here is not a metric of the coupling strength, but a reliable statistical test that selectively detects coupling, and my intuition is that counts in the phase-phase plot may provide one. If a simple correction can be applied to give a sound statistical test, this could allow Belluscio and colleagues to look back at their data and see whether the significant counts indeed resist correction for multiple comparisons.</i>"

For instance, a phase-phase plot of 120 x 120 bins (i.e., 3<sup>o</sup> bins) has 14400 bin counts. If a single bin count out of these 14400 bins is deemed statistically significant (after an appropriate correction), should we consider the time series n:m phase-coupled? We particularly did not consider that having only one bin deemed statistically significant would suffice. But then, what would be the minimal number of significant bins for assuming n:m phase-coupling? And would the appearance of striped patterns be necessary? Or would a few significant bins scattered at random locations suffice? Again, especially considering that there is a well-defined metric of n:m phase-coupling (R<sub>n:m</sub>), we had particular difficulty in considering the bin count analysis a proper one. That said, though, we do respect the opposite opinion manifested by the reviewer, and have followed the suggestion of subjecting the p-values of phase-phase bin counts to a correction for multiple comparisons. These analyses show that the statistically significant bins in phase-phase plots of white noise under the original framework of Belluscio et al. do not persist after correcting for multiple comparisons using Holm-Bonferroni (we considered the FDR correction too liberal since it led to significant bins in white noise). The results were true when building surrogate distribution using both Time Shift and Random Permutation procedures.

However, we note that bin counts are deemed statistically significant even after correction when employing randomly permutated surrogates, especially for very long epochs (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). We agree with the reviewer that n:m coupling measures cannot separate true coupling from asymmetrical waves; while we indeed tend to ascribe these results to harmonic influences, in the revised manuscript we now state our interpretation more cautiously and leave open the possibility of true theta-gamma phase coupling (subsection \u201cOn diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots\u201d, fifth paragraph, and the Conclusion)."

So in my opinion here the effect is rather due to the temporary n:m alignment of phases, just as for white noise.

Indeed, after performing new analyses on white noise and actual LFPs (which led to new <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>, <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we came to agree with the reviewer that the temporary n:m phase alignment due to the sinusoidality induced by filtering is a main factor in determining the diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots. These conclusions are backed by data shown in our new figures and explicitly stated in subsection \u201cOn diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots\u201d, last three paragraphs and subsection \u201cStatistical inference of phase-phase coupling\u201d, last paragraph. However, our new analyses now reveal that in actual LFP signals there is a second influence, which is not accounted for solely by filtering. This effect is only statistically detected when analyzing very long epoch lengths (&gt;100 s) and when contrasting original results (either phase-phase plots or Rnm curves) against randomly permutated data (please see new <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). Based on our analysis of sawtooth wave (in which random permutation was more sensitive to detect coupling than time-shifted surrogates, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and given that the effect of filtering-induced sinusoidality is controlled for in surrogate data, we particularly believe that the weak (Rnm=0.03) but significant coupling detected in very long time series is due to theta harmonics (discussed in subsection \u201cStatistical inference of phase-phase coupling\u201d, last paragraph). But in the revised manuscript we leave open the possibility of this low level of coupling as denoting true coupling (subsection \u201cOn diagonal stripes in phase-phase plots\u201d, fifth paragraph, subsection \u201cStatistical inference of phase-phase coupling\u201d, last paragraph, subsection \u201cLack of evidence vs. evidence of non-existence\u201d, last paragraph, and the Conclusion)."

However, as established by theoretical studies of coupled oscillators, n:m coupling is not a fixed property of the network but emerges as a combination of oscillator intrinsic dynamics and the characteristics of the connectivity pattern. See for example Arnold tongue: if we assume there is just one fixed gamma, a fluctuating theta and fixed connectivity, it is perfectly normal that n:m coupling will shift from 1:5 to 1:4 if the lower oscillator accelerates and the ratio of frequency goes from around 5 to around 4.</i>"

This is a comment for the authors benefit and speaks to the overall comment mentioned above. Sharp edges in LFP/EEG are not by itself an indication that we are measuring a single asymmetrical oscillation as the superposition of a slow and a fast n:m coupled oscillation can also give rise to sharp edges (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; note that this can even be obtained with just two oscillations). Thus, sharp edges is no more a selective feature of asymmetrical oscillations than n:m coherence is selective of phase-coupled oscillators.
