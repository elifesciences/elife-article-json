We showed that, during the initial stages of axon outgrowth, microtubules display mixed polarity and minus-end-out microtubules push the tip of the axon, consistent with kinesin-1 driving outgrowth by sliding antiparallel microtubules. At later stages, the microtubule orientation in the axon switches from mixed to uniform polarity with plus-end-out. Dynein knockdown prevents this rearrangement and results in microtubules of mixed orientation in axons and accumulation of microtubule minus-ends at axon tips. Microtubule reorganization requires recruitment of dynein to the actin cortex, as actin depolymerization phenocopies dynein depletion, and direct recruitment of dynein to the membrane bypasses the actin requirement. Our results show that cortical dynein slides \u2018minus-end-out\u2019 microtubules from the axon, generating uniform microtubule arrays. We speculate that differences in microtubule orientation between axons and dendrites could be dictated by differential activity of cortical dynein."

Thus, del Castillo et al.\u2019s findings reveal that these dynein motors are responsible for the polarity of microtubules in mature axons. The next challenge is to understand how dynein is attached to the actin scaffold and why it rearranges microtubules in axons, but not in dendrites."

Developing neurons grow long microtubule-based axons and dendrites. Over the last decades, the origin of the mechanical forces that drive process formation in neurons has been the subject of numerous studies (<a href=\"#bib48\">Suter and Miller, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015</a>). Recently, our lab demonstrated that kinesin-1, a major microtubule motor, slides microtubules against each other in many cell types (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jolly et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barlan et al., 2013</a>), including neurons, and this sliding plays an important role in neuronal polarization. We have shown that microtubule-microtubule sliding is required for initial axon formation and regeneration after injury (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lu et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">2015</a>). This process is likely required for neurodevelopment in many organisms besides <i>Drosophila</i>, as kinesin-driven microtubule sliding has been implicated in generating the minus-end-out microtubule pattern observed in dendrites of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> neurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yan et al., 2013</a>)."

Each kinesin-1 molecule is a heterotetramer that consists of two heavy chains (KHC) and two light chains (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kuznetsov et al., 1988</a>). Each KHC polypeptide contains two microtubule-binding domains: one ATP-dependent site in the motor domain and a second ATP-independent site at the C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hackney and Stock, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Seeger and Rice, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yan et al., 2013</a>). Kinesin-1 is thought to slide microtubules against each other with these two heavy chain domains; one microtubule is used as a track, while the other is transported as a cargo; kinesin light chains are not required for sliding (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jolly et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yan et al., 2013</a>)."

However, kinesin-1 is a plus-end motor, and therefore can only slide microtubules with their minus-ends leading and plus-ends trailing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which is inconsistent with the final orientation of microtubules in mature axons. To address this apparent contradiction, we asked two questions: First, are microtubules indeed pushed with their minus-ends out at the initial stages of axon outgrowth, as would be expected if they are pushed by kinesin-1? Second, if this is the case, how are microtubules with the \u2018wrong\u2019 orientation replaced by microtubules with normal (plus-end-out) orientation in mature axons? To address these questions, we imaged and tracked markers of microtubule plus-ends and minus-ends in cultured <i>Drosophila</i> neurons and S2 cells at different stages of process growth. Our results showed that, at the initial stages of neurite formation, microtubules have mixed polarity with minus-ends being pushed against the plasma membrane; later, cytoplasmic dynein, attached to the actin cortex, removes minus-end-out microtubules to the cell body, creating microtubule arrays with uniform plus-end-out orientation. We speculate that regulation of dynein\u2019s microtubule sorting activity could explain the differences in microtubule orientation between axons and dendrites."

Because kinesin-1 is a plus-end microtubule motor, it can only slide microtubules with their minus-ends leading and plus-ends trailing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). If this model is correct, it suggests that kinesin-1 must extend neurites by pushing microtubule minus-ends against the plasma membrane during the initial stages of neurite formation. Furthermore, because the model predicts that two microtubules have to be in antiparallel orientation to slide against each other, sliding by kinesin-1 will result in the simultaneous transport of two microtubules in opposite directions (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and the legend for the explanation).

We initially performed experiments with GFP-tagged Patronin, the single <i>Drosophila</i> member of CAMSAP family (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wang et al., 2013</a>), but its expression level in S2 cells was very low and GFP signal was not robustly found on microtubules (data no shown).

Because the microtubule network is normally too dense to identify both ends of microtubules, we induced the formation of short microtubules in cells by partial depolymerization with 25 \u00b5M Vinblastine for 1\u00a0hr. Examination of these short microtubule fragments demonstrated that only one end of each microtubule contained a GFP-CAMSAP3 patch (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In untreated S2 cells, spontaneous growth and shrinkage events associated with the dynamic instability of microtubule plus-ends were not seen in microtubule ends decorated by GFP-CAMSAP3, suggesting that GFP-CAMSAP3 labels microtubule minus-ends in <i>Drosophila</i>\u00a0cells (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Furthermore, EB1-GFP and mCherry-CAMSAP3 never colocalized when expressed in the same cell, further confirming the minus-end localization of CAMSAP3 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B and 1C</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>).

We found that a significant fraction of growing processes contained GFP-CAMSAP3 dots at their tips, and that these processes only elongated when microtubule minus-ends were present at their tips (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>).

Neurons were harvested and cultured from the brains of larvae expressing GFP-CAMSAP3 driven by the pan-neuronal promoter <i>elav-Gal4</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Egger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lu et al., 2015</a>) (see Material and methods). We visualized microtubule minus-ends in growing neurites at the initial stages of growth (4\u2009hr after plating), when neurons started to develop processes (length= 9.96 \u00b5m, s.d. \u00b1 4.5 \u00b5m, n=50 axons). We found that, like in S2 cells, the growing neurites contained GFP-CAMSAP3 dots at the tips of neurites, and localization of the dots to the tips precisely correlated with neurite outgrowth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013I</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). All together, these data show that at least a fraction of microtubules in growing neurites have the \u2018wrong\u2019 orientation (minus-end-out). Localization of microtubule minus-end(s) at the neurite tip correlates with neurite outgrowth, consistent with kinesin-1 pushing the minus-ends of microtubules against the plasma membrane driving the initial outgrowth."

To test this prediction, we imaged and tracked the direction of the plus-end microtubule marker, EB1-GFP, in the axons of cultured neurons at different time points after plating. Quantitative analysis of EB1-GFP comets using tracking software (see Material and methods) demonstrated that, shortly after plating, growing neurites contained EB1 comets moving in both anterograde and retrograde directions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). The microtubule orientation in axons remained mixed during the 1st day in culture.

We hypothesized that this sorting factor is cytoplasmic dynein because it has been reported that mutations in dynein light intermediate chain or dynein-cofactors (NudE) are required for uniform microtubule orientation in axons of <i>Drosophila</i> dendritic arborization (da) neurons (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zheng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arthur et al., 2015</a>). To characterize the role of dynein, we expressed two different shRNAs targeting dynein heavy chain (DHC) using <i>elav-Gal4</i> to specifically knock\u00a0down dynein in neurons. <i>elav&gt;DHC RNAi</i> animals developed to the third instar larval stage; however, their locomotion was severely impaired and most died before reaching the pupae stage (data not shown). In addition, none of the surviving <i>elav&gt;DHC RNAi</i> pupae eclosed into adults. We cultured neurons obtained from brains of third instar <i>elav&gt;DHC RNAi</i> larvae. Our lab has previously shown that mitochondrial movement was substantially diminished in <i>elav&gt;DHC RNAi</i> neurons, indicating that the activity of dynein is impaired in those neurons (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lu et al., 2015</a>)."

We hypothesized that organization of microtubules in axons, like their organization in the mitotic spindle, requires anchoring of dynein to the cortical network of actin filaments. To test this idea, we depolymerized actin filaments in cultured <i>Drosophila</i> neurons by treatment with LatB and quantified microtubule orientation in axons. We found that increasing concentrations of LatB gradually reduced the amount of F-actin, as judged by the intensity of rhodamine-phalloidin staining (data not shown). In parallel with F-actin depolymerization, axons displayed an increased fraction of microtubules with plus-ends facing the cell body (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). At a high concentration of LatB (10 \u00b5M), when virtually no F-actin can be detected, about half of all EB1 comets moved toward the cell body, demonstrating that depolymerization of actin induced random microtubule orientation in neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

Endogenous dynein can be recruited to the plasma membrane in S2 cells coexpressing FRB-GFP-BicD and GAP43-FKBP. In the presence of 10 \u00b5M LatB, cortical actin is depolymerized and therefore dynein remains soluble in the cytoplasm. Addition of 1 \u00b5M rapalog induces the direct recruitment of the dynein-BicD complex to the plasma membrane (see Material and methods). The sorting activity of dynein was tracked by imaging mCherry-CAMSAP3. (H) Still images from time-lapses of a S2 cell before (left panel) and after addition of rapalog (middle and right panels). Magenta and green arrowheads represent the position of the membrane and the CAMSAP3, respectively. Note that the CAMSAP3 signal moves toward the cell body when rapalog is added while there is not a substantial retraction of the processes (see <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). If the same experiment is performed in DHC RNAi cells, addition of rapalog does not induce retrograde transport of the minus-end-out microtubules from the tips of processes (see <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). Scale bars, 10 \u00b5m. (<b>I</b>) Schematic representation of the BicD-dynein recruitment assays (microtubule minus-ends are represented in magenta).

To test this prediction, we washed out LatB and tracked the localization of GFP-CAMSAP3. We observed that the LatB washout induced removal of GFP-CAMSAP3 from axon tips without affecting the length of the axon (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). It should be mentioned that LatB washout did not result in the normal scattered distribution of minus-ends along the length of the axon observed in control neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, left panels).

For these experiments, we used a dynein recruitment tool developed by the Akhmanova and Hoogenraad labs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Hoogenraad et al., 2003</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib21\">Kapitein et al., 2010</a>), which contains the dynein activator Bicaudal D (BicD) fused to a FRB domain (FRB-GFP-BicD). The FRB-BicD-dynein complex can then be recruited to any region of interest by coexpression of a targeting protein coupled to a FKBP domain. This FKBP domain chemically dimerizes with the FRB domain in the presence of rapalog (a cell-permeable small molecule analog of rapamycin) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clackson et al., 1998</a>). To confirm that the FRB-FKBP dimerization system for dynein recruitment works in <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells, we first coexpressed a GFP construct fused to FRB (FRB-GFP) and the peroxisome membrane-targeting signal peptide coupled to the red fluorescent protein (PEX3-RFP-FKBP). In the absence of rapalog, the GFP signal appeared soluble in the cytoplasm. The addition of rapalog recruited FRB-GFP to peroxisomes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We next used this system to directly recruit dynein to the plasma membrane. For membrane targeting, we fused the transmembrane domain of GAP-43 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Heim and Griesbeck, 2004</a>) with FKBP and coexpressed this construct with FRB-GFP-BicD in S2 cells. To visualize the recruitment of BicD to the membrane in these cells, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to image the GFP signal before and after addition of rapalog. Quantification showed that addition of rapalog significantly increased the intensity of the GFP fluorescence due to recruitment of cytoplasmic BicD to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

Time-lapse imaging before addition of the drug revealed that these CAMSAP3 clusters, marking positions of minus-ends, were either static or pushing against the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). However, when the BicD-dynein complex was recruited to the membrane by addition of rapalog, CAMSAP3-labeled microtubule minus-ends robustly moved away from the tip, toward the cell body (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>, top panels; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>; <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>).

At early stages of neurite formation, the minus-ends of sliding microtubules are pushed against the plasma membrane, generating the forces that drive initial neurite outgrowth. At this stage, growing neurites contain microtubule arrays of mixed orientation. However, later in development, axonal microtubule arrays are reorganized from mixed to uniform (plus-end-out) orientation, consistent with the well\u00a0established microtubule organization described in mammalian (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baas et al., 1988</a>) and <i>Drosophila</i> axons (<a href=\"#bib46\">Stone et al., 2008</a>).

The well\u00a0established function of these mitotic motors is to reorganize and stabilize the mitotic spindle to facilitate chromosome segregation. These motors accumulate in the spindle midzone where antiparallel microtubules coming from opposite poles overlap. Our work shows that developing <i>Drosophila</i> axons, like the spindle midzone, are filled with antiparallel microtubule arrays.

Therefore, neurons must activate an additional sorting mechanism that eliminates these \u2018wrong\u2019 polarity microtubules from axons. Previous studies reported that dynein and dynein-associated proteins are required for correct microtubule orientation in axons of <i>Drosophila</i> da sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zheng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Arthur et al., 2015</a>). Our results using cultured neurons are in full agreement with these studies, as dynein knockdown caused mixed microtubule polarity in axons. Interestingly, several studies have linked dynein-mediated microtubule reorganization to actin, both in interphase (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mazel et al., 2014</a>) and in mitosis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kotak et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013</a>). In this study, we showed that depolymerization of actin filaments (including cortical actin) using high concentrations of LatB causes the same defects in microtubule orientation as dynein knockdown. Recovery of cortical actin after drug washout results in efficient dynein-driven removal of minus-end-out microtubules from the tips of processes. Furthermore, the requirement for actin can be efficiently bypassed by direct recruitment of the dynein machinery directly to the plasma membrane. Therefore, we propose that microtubule sorting depends on the activity of cytoplasmic dynein attached to the cortical actin filament meshwork. However, as we did not get complete recovery of the wild\u00a0type distribution of microtubules in our LatB washout or dynein-membrane recruitment experiments, it is likely that additional proteins that link actin and microtubule pathways in the neuron are involved in microtubule organization; one good candidate is the well characterized actin-microtubule crosslinking protein Short stop (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee and Kolodziej, 2002</a>)."

A more recent study by Miller et al. has reported that dynein generates forces that push the cytoskeletal meshwork forward during axonal elongation in cultured chick sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib41\">Roossien et al., 2014</a>). In agreement with their data, we predict that cortical dynein can promote axon outgrowth after the initial stages of neurite outgrowth, when microtubules are sorted into a plus-end-out orientation. Because the direction of dynein-powered forces is dictated by the intrinsic orientation of microtubules, microtubules with minus-end-out are redirected toward the cell body, whereas plus-end-out microtubules are transported toward the tip of the axon. Therefore, dynein-driven microtubule transport can not only remove microtubules with the wrong orientation (minus-end-out) but also push microtubules of the right orientation (plus-end-out) toward the axon tip."

It has been proposed that several microtubule severing proteins are able to fragment microtubules into short pieces (<a href=\"#bib36\">McNally and Vale, 1993</a>). In this scenario, short microtubule seeds are generated which may be reoriented by diffusion forces in either direction (plus-end-in or plus-end-out) with equal probability. Indeed, active bidirectional transport of short microtubule fragments in the axons has been described in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). The authors proposed that the transport of these short microtubule fragments is driven by dynein. Our prediction is that microtubule fragments transported in the retrograde direction should be oriented with plus-ends toward the cell body while anterogradely transported fragments should have the opposite orientation."

Both motors play an important role in axon formation. However, the contribution of each motor likely differs at different developing stages (see model described in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In spherically shaped undifferentiated cells, kinesin-1 motors slide antiparallel microtubules perpendicularly to the plasma membrane with their minus-end-leading (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This sliding generates the force that breaks the symmetry of the cell and induces a deformation of the plasma membrane to initiate neurite outgrowth. During this stage, the role of cortical dynein is probably limited by steric restrictions. Cortical dynein can only slide microtubules tangential to the plasma membrane, and therefore dynein-mediated movement cannot deform the membrane and initiate outgrowth. At the next stage, nascent neurites contain antiparallel microtubule arrays (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This configuration allows kinesin-1 to continue to drive antiparallel microtubule sliding. Once the processes start to form, the new geometry will allow cortical dynein to contribute to both microtubule organization and neurite outgrowth. Cortical dynein in the neurite cortex can only slide microtubules parallel to the axis of the process. This contribution of cortical dynein likely increases as the processes grow longer (engaging more cortical dynein molecules) and thinner (allowing dynein to reach a larger fraction of microtubules in the processes)."

As a result of this continuous sorting activity of dynein, developed axons contain uniform microtubule arrays with their plus-end distal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Under this new microtubule configuration, kinesin-1 contributes little to microtubule sliding (as antiparallel microtubule arrays are needed for kinesin to engage in sliding), but instead favors its bundling activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right panel). In addition to its contribution to neurite outgrowth, cortical dynein may have an important role in axon maintenance, removing nascent microtubules of wrong orientation that may appear in the axon either due to new microtubule polymerization or due to the severing of pre-existing microtubules. Because axons and dendrites are common morphologic features observed in neurons from ancestral metazoans to mammals, we postulate that the same molecular mechanism presented here for axon formation in <i>Drosophila</i> neurons is conserved in other organisms. Of course, this \u2018microtubule-centric\u2019 model does not describe all the mechanisms involved in axon formation, and clearly leaves out the critical question of axon guidance, but it provides clear roles for multiple microtubule motors involved in axon formation and microtubule organization."

Neurons were plated onto Concanavalin A-coated coverslips in supplemented Schneider\u2019s medium (20% fetal bovine serum, 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml insulin, 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 10 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline). For actin depolymerization assays, neurons were plated in Xpress medium for 2\u2009hr before addition of LatB. <i>Drosophila</i> S2 cells were cultured as previously described (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barlan et al., 2013</a>). To induce the formation of processes in S2 cultures, cells were plated in the presence of 0.5 \u00b5M LatB. For knockdown assays in S2 cells, cultures at 1.5 x\u00a010<sup>6</sup> cells/mL were treated twice with 20 \u00b5g of dsRNA (day 1 and day 3) and cell analysis was performed on day 5. Double-stranded RNA was transcribed in vitro with T7 polymerase, and purified using LiCl extraction. Primers used to create T7 templates from fly genomic DNA were as follows. T7 promoter sequences (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) were added to the 5\u2032 end of each primer).

Images were acquired using Evolve EMCCD (Photometrics) and controlled by Nikon Elements 4.00.07 software. For EB1 and CAMSAP3 time-lapses, images were collected every 2 s for 1\u2009min (EB1 comets) and every 1\u2009min or 5\u2009min for 16\u2009min or 60\u2009min, respectively (CAMSAP3). To image the plasma membrane, CellMask Deep Red dye (1:10,000) was added in both cultured neurons and S2 cells 5\u2009min before imaging. For To\u00a0visualize\u00a0sliding, a small fraction of microtubules in cultured neurons expressing <i>tdEOS-\u03b1Tub84B</i> was\u00a0photoconverted. Photoconversion was performed by confining the illumination of a heliophore laser (405 nm) in the epifluorescence pathway using a diaphragm. Images were collected once per 30 s for 5\u2009min. To image the recruitment of BicD to the plasma membrane and the distribution of CAMSAP3 in mature neurons, TIRF images were collected using a Nikon Eclipse U2000 inverted microscope equipped with a Plan-Apo TIRF 100\u00d7/1.45 NA objective and a Hamamatsu CMOS Orca Flash 4.0 camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), controlled by MetaMorph 7.7.7.0 software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA).

EB1 comets were tracked using the plus-end tracking algorithm in u-track 2.0, developed by Gaudenz Danuser\u2019s group (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jaqaman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Matov et al., 2010</a>). The x-y positions of EB1 comets were extracted and loaded into a custom ImageJ plugin. This semi-automated plugin defined the center of cells and determined the angle of each comet\u2019s trajectory as compared with the cell center. For curved and serpentine axons, trajectories were subdivided into linear segments before ImageJ analysis to ensure that comet orientation was correctly identified. Comet trajectories with an angle &gt;290\u00b0 or &lt;70\u00b0 compared with the cell center were defined as plus-end-out. Comet trajectories with an angle &gt;110 and &lt;250 degrees were defined as plus-end-in. Only comets contained in processes were included in the analysis. To create kymographs presented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E and Figure 2A</a> the Reslice plugin developed in FIJI was used. Statistical significance for EB1 comets was determined using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test with a confidence interval of 95%. This test analysis compares the distributions of two unmatched groups."

To directly recruit endogenous dynein to the membrane, S2 cells were cotransfected with plasmids codifying GAP43-FKBP, FRB-GFP-BicD and mCherry-CAMSAP3 in the following ratio (3:1:1). Cells were plated with 10 \u00b5M LatB for 2\u00a0hr to allow the accumulation of microtubule minus-ends at process tips.

These publications have demonstrated that CAMSAPs label minus-ends of microtubules exclusively and play an important physiological role in minus-end stabilization.

This is an important question that we did not fully address in our original manuscript. To explore this possibility, we performed new experiments to test whether EB1 comets localize at the tips of growing processes in S2 cells. Briefly, in actively growing processes of S2 cells, we simultaneously imaged microtubule plus-ends with EB1-GFP and process tips outlined with a plasma membrane dye. We have shown a representative example of this experiment in the new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>. Note that during the initial outgrowth of processes, EB1 does not colocalize with process tips. Furthermore, as the reviewers requested, we quantified the colocalization of plus- or minus-end markers with the tips of growing processes seen with a membrane dye (see new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). We found that minus-ends colocalized with process tips during 94% of outgrowth events (n=55 processes). However, plus-ends only localized to the tips of processes during 33% of outgrowth events (n=51 processes). Based on this data, we believe that microtubule minus-ends play the critical role in the early stages of outgrowth, but it is possible that plus ends have some contribution to the growth, especially at the later stages (subsection \u201cMicrotubule minus-ends push neurite tips at the initial stages of process formation\u201d, fifth paragraph and subsection \u201cAdditional roles of cortical dynein for microtubule organization in axons\u201c, first paragraph)."

In fact, we see no contradiction here, as the cartoon (left) and the confocal image (right) (S2 cell/GFP-CAMSAP3) below help to explain. Accumulation of minus ends at process tips only means that the most distal microtubules have their minus-end at the tips; these microtubules are deposited to the tip by kinesin-driven sliding. However, microtubules located closer to the cell body can (and do) have mixed polarity. The location of minus ends in the shafts of the processes may not be obvious in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 2H and 3E</a> because the signal from individual GFP-CAMSAP3 minus ends within these regions is much dimmer that of the many clustered minus-ends at the tip. In fact, adjustment of contrast of the boxed area in the right panel clearly shows multiple GFP-CAMSAP3 speckles in the shaft (bottom right panel), as predicted by the cartoon on the left.

The third instar larvae (<i>elav&gt;GFP-CAMSAP3 + DHCi</i>) developed the same survival and locomotion defects than were observed in elav&gt;DHC RNAi alone, indicating that the DHC shRNA efficiently depleted DHC even when Gal4 drove GFP-CAMSAP3 and DHC shRNA simultaneously. We incorporated a new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> to show the localization of GFP-CAMSAP3 in <i>elav&gt;GFP-CAMSAP3 and elav&gt;GFP-CAMSAP3 + DHCi</i>. Note that depletion of DHC induced accumulation of GFP-CAMSAP3 in the tips of neurites, just as it did after DHC depletion in S2 cell processes, directly answering the reviewer\u2019s question."

This induced accumulation of GFP-CAMSAP3 in neurite tips (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, left panel). To activate microtubule-microtubule sorting, we washed out LatB and followed the localization of the CAMSAP3 signal and membrane tip. As we show in the new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> (right panels) LatB washout caused the removal of minus-ends from neurite tips without affecting the length of the axon. We have to point out, however, that the minus-end clusters do not get expelled all the way to the cell body, most likely because at this stage, axons contain highly bundled minus-end-out microtubules. See the new data in subsection \u201cDynein must be recruited to the actin cortex to sort microtubules\u201d, second paragraph."

The new data show a better example of dynein sorting activity after addition of rapalog and no process retraction. Furthermore, we added a new experimental condition (DHC RNAi), which demonstrates that dynein depletion prevents the removal of minus-end-out microtubules after addition of rapalog. As reviewers requested, we quantified the removal of minus-end clusters from the tips after the addition of rapalog. The quantification shows that, in control cells, minus-end clusters were removed from about 70% of tips after addition of rapalog, while in DHC RNAi-treated cells, removal was observed in only 3% (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>)."

Our results experimentally demonstrate that cortical dynein is involved in sorting microtubules of <i>Drosophila</i> processes. Our experiments place dynein activity downstream of actin in the microtubule organization pathway. However, at this moment it is unknown whether dynein interacts with actin directly or through adaptors (as, for example, has been extensively demonstrated in case of spindle orientation in dividing cells). Furthermore, as correctly pointed out by the reviewer, actin can be involved in microtubule organization via additional mechanisms (such as actin-microtubule cross-linker short stop). Therefore, we have toned down the direct interaction hypothesis in the manuscript. In addition, we mentioned in the Discussion section, the potential contribution of proteins known to link microtubules (subsection \u201cCortical dynein sorts microtubules in developing axons\u201d)."
