In this study, we employ quantitative live imaging methods to assess the function of pairs of primary and shadow enhancers in the regulation of key patterning genes-<i>knirps</i>, <i>hunchback</i>, and <i>snail</i>-in developing <i>Drosophila</i> embryos. The knirps enhancers exhibit additive, sometimes even super-additive activities, consistent with classical gene fusion studies. In contrast, the <i>hunchback</i> enhancers function sub-additively in anterior regions containing saturating levels of the Bicoid activator, but function additively in regions where there are diminishing levels of the Bicoid gradient. Strikingly sub-additive behavior is also observed for <i>snail</i>, whereby removal of the proximal enhancer causes a significant increase in gene expression. Quantitative modeling of enhancer\u2013promoter interactions suggests that weakly active enhancers function additively while strong enhancers behave sub-additively due to competition with the target promoter."

In this study, we employ quantitative live imaging methods to assess the function of pairs of primary and shadow enhancers in the regulation of key patterning genes-<i>knirps</i>, <i>hunchback</i>, and <i>snail</i>-in developing <i>Drosophila</i> embryos. The knirps enhancers exhibit additive, sometimes even super-additive activities, consistent with classical gene fusion studies. In contrast, the <i>hunchback</i> enhancers function sub-additively in anterior regions containing saturating levels of the Bicoid activator, but function additively in regions where there are diminishing levels of the Bicoid gradient. Strikingly sub-additive behavior is also observed for <i>snail</i>, whereby removal of the proximal enhancer causes a significant increase in gene expression. Quantitative modeling of enhancer\u2013promoter interactions suggests that weakly active enhancers function additively while strong enhancers behave sub-additively due to competition with the target promoter."

For example, the mouse <i>Sonic Hedgehog</i> gene is regulated by at least 20 different enhancers scattered over a distance of \u223c1 Mb (<a href=\"#bib13\">Jeong et al., 2006</a>). Individual enhancers mediate expression in a variety of different tissues, including the brain, floorplate, and limb buds. Multiple enhancers with overlapping regulatory activities are also used to control gene expression within individual cell types. For example, the transcriptional activation of the gap gene <i>hunchback (hb)</i> in the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo is mediated by both a proximal enhancer and distal \u2018shadow\u2019 enhancer that independently mediate activation in response to high levels of the Bicoid activator gradient (<a href=\"#bib3\">Buecker and Wysocka, 2012</a>). Despite overwhelming evidence for multiple enhancers regulating the same gene it is unknown whether they simultaneously interact with the same promoter in a given cell. Here, we use a combination of quantitative live imaging and theoretical modeling to investigate the function of multiple enhancers for the regulation of a common target gene within a single cell type."

An alternative view is that shadow enhancers suppress transcriptional noise and help foster uniform expression among the different cells of a population (<a href=\"#bib3\">Buecker and Wysocka, 2012</a>). To explore these and other potential mechanisms, we examined the timing and levels of gene activity using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) transgenes containing individual enhancers and combinations of primary and shadow enhancers in the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo."

In contrast, the <i>hb</i> enhancers function sub-additively in anterior regions containing saturating levels of the Bicoid activator but function additively in regions where there are diminishing levels of the Bicoid gradient. Strikingly, sub-additive behavior is also observed for sna, in that removal of the proximal enhancer causes a significant increase in gene expression. These observations suggest that the levels of enhancer activity determine the switch between additive and non-additive behaviors."

Detection depends on the binding of a maternal mRNA-binding fusion protein (MCP::GFP) expressed throughout the early embryo. In order to examine the interplay between multiple enhancers, we created a series of BAC transgenes containing complete regulatory landscapes (summarized in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

We measured the transcriptional activity of all three <i>hb</i> BAC transgenes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,F,H</a>). Contrary to simple expectations suggested by previous studies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arnold et al., 2013</a>), we find that the two <i>hb</i> enhancers do not function in an additive fashion in anterior regions (20\u201340% egg length, EL) of the embryo (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Indeed, the levels produced by the wild-type transgene fall far short of the additive levels predicted by simply summing the levels of expression produced by the transgenes containing either the shadow or primary enhancer alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Moreover, the removal of the shadow enhancer has no effect on the levels of transcription in anterior regions, which is consistent with the original conception of the shadow enhancer as a \u2018back-up\u2019 in the event of stress (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hong et al., 2008</a>)."

In this region, the wild-type transgene produces significantly higher levels of expression than either of the transgenes driven by a single enhancer. In fact, these levels correspond to the values predicted by simply adding the activities of the single-enhancer transgenes. Thus, the two enhancers transition from <i>sub-additive</i> to <i>additive</i> behavior in the region of the embryo where there are diminishing levels of the Bicoid activator gradient. We therefore suggest that the <i>hb</i> enhancers function additively only when they are operating below peak capacity (see below)."

In this regime, the enhancers will work additively, and the rate of mRNA production of enhancers A and B will simply be the sum of the production rate of A and B alone as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>. However, as the strength of promoter\u2013enhancer interactions increases, the combined activity of both enhancers is less than the sum of each individual enhancer. When we model enhancers of different strengths (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), the amount of mRNA production is reduced as the enhancer with the weaker transcriptional efficiency interacts more frequently with the promoter. This occurs because the two enhancers compete for access to the promoter, effectively inhibiting one another. Thus, weak enhancers might work additively due to infrequent interactions with the target promoter, whereas strong enhancers interfere with one another due to more frequent interactions (see below)."

We found that the removal of the proximal enhancer significantly augments expression, consistent with the occurrence of enhancer interference within the native locus. It is also conceivable that a single strong enhancer (e.g., <i>hb</i> proximal or <i>sna</i> distal) already mediates maximum binding and release of Pol II at the promoter, and additional enhancers are therefore unable to increase the levels of expression. However, the increase in the levels of <i>sna</i> expression upon removal of the primary enhancer is inconsistent with this explanation. Perhaps, the proximity of the proximal enhancer to the <i>sna</i> promoter gives it a \u2018topological advantage\u2019 in blocking access of the distal enhancer (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dunipace et al., 2011</a>). The proximal enhancer might mediate less efficient transcription than the distal enhancer and thereby reduce the overall levels of expression (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). We do not believe that this proposed difference is due to differential rates of Pol II elongation since published (<a href=\"#bib7\">Garcia et al., 2013</a>) and preliminary studies suggest that different enhancers and promoters lead to similar elongation rates (\u223c2 kb/min; T Fuyaka and M Levine, unpublished results). A nonexclusive alternative possibility is that deletion of the proximal enhancer removes associated <i>sna</i> repression elements (<a href=\"#bib22\">MacArthur et al., 2009</a>), thereby augmenting the efficiency of the distal enhancer."

For <i>hb</i>, this switch between competitive and additive behavior occurs as the levels of Bicoid activator diminish in central regions where the posterior border of the anterior Hb domain is formed. Similarly, stress might reduce the performance of the <i>sna</i> enhancers to foster additive behavior under unfavorable conditions such as increases in temperature (<a href=\"#bib25\">Perry et al., 2010</a>). Our study highlights the complexity of multiple enhancers in the regulation of gene expression.

Here, the enhancer and promoter engage and disengage with one another with characteristic rate constants k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub>, respectively (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The ratio between k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> determines the strength of the promoter-enhancer interaction. The system can be found in two states. First, the promoter can be unoccupied. We denote the occupancy of this state with [Enhancer]. Second, the promoter and enhancer can be engaged with an occupancy [Enhancer\u00b7Promoter]. Following the reaction scheme shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, the temporal evolution of the occupancy of the state where the enhancer and promoter are engaged is given by"

The expression of Snail would thus induce some sort of negative feedback, if the binding measured in that study is indeed active. In light of the findings from this manuscript, where the primary enhancer by itself is weaker, and the shadow enhancer by itself is able to drive gene expression at about wild-type levels, it appears that Snail self-inhibition may be compromising promoter activity to reduce the overall output. Previous studies of the related short-range repressor Knirps have shown that this class of repressor may induce local, heterochromatized-like chromatin status (Li and Arnosti, 2011), thus if Snail is doing the same thing, the activity of this proximal element should be considered as a mix of active \u201csilencer\u201d-like activity with \u201cenhancer\u201d-like action in the classic sense.
