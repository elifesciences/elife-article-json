Their effect on spontaneously developing autoimmune diseases has been little explored. We report that a short treatment with I-BET151, a small-molecule inhibitor of a family of bromodomain-containing transcriptional regulators, irreversibly suppressed development of type-1 diabetes in NOD mice. The inhibitor could prevent or clear insulitis, but had minimal influence on the transcriptomes of infiltrating and circulating T cells. Rather, it induced pancreatic macrophages to adopt an anti-inflammatory phenotype, impacting the NF-\u03baB pathway in particular. I-BET151 also elicited regeneration of islet \u03b2-cells, inducing proliferation and expression of genes encoding transcription factors key to \u03b2-cell differentiation/function. The effect on \u03b2 cells did not require T cell infiltration of the islets. Thus, treatment with I-BET151 achieves a 'combination therapy,' currently advocated by many diabetes investigators, operating by a novel mechanism that coincidentally dampens islet inflammation and enhances \u03b2-cell regeneration."
