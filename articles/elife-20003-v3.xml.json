Using murine myelin-reactive CD4 T cells, we demonstrate that proximal T cell signaling modulates Notch activation by a spatiotemporally constrained mechanism. The protein kinase PKC\u03b8 is a critical mediator of signaling by the T cell antigen receptor and the principal costimulatory receptor CD28. PKC\u03b8 selectively inactivates the negative regulator of F-actin generation, Coronin 1A, at the center of the T cell interface with the antigen presenting cell (APC). This allows for effective generation of the large actin-based lamellum required for recruitment of the Notch-processing membrane metalloproteinase ADAM10. Such enhancement of Notch activation is critical for efficient T cell proliferation and Th17 differentiation. We reveal a novel mechanism that, through modulation of the cytoskeleton, controls Notch activation at the T cell:APC interface thereby linking T cell receptor and Notch signaling pathways."

Using murine myelin-reactive CD4 T cells, we demonstrate that proximal T cell signaling modulates Notch activation by a spatiotemporally constrained mechanism. The protein kinase PKC\u03b8 is a critical mediator of signaling by the T cell antigen receptor and the principal costimulatory receptor CD28. PKC\u03b8 selectively inactivates the negative regulator of F-actin generation, Coronin 1A, at the center of the T cell interface with the antigen presenting cell (APC). This allows for effective generation of the large actin-based lamellum required for recruitment of the Notch-processing membrane metalloproteinase ADAM10. Such enhancement of Notch activation is critical for efficient T cell proliferation and Th17 differentiation. We reveal a novel mechanism that, through modulation of the cytoskeleton, controls Notch activation at the T cell:APC interface thereby linking T cell receptor and Notch signaling pathways."

The results show that a protein found inside the T cell, called PKC\u03b8, is a major contributor to Notch activation when T cells become activated. So how does the PKC\u03b8 protein control the activation of Notch? Britton et al. observed that PKC\u03b8 inactivates a protein that normally inhibits actin filaments from forming, and does so specifically at the center of the immunological synapse. This inhibition promotes the generation of a large actin-rich structure known as the lamellal actin network. This structure is required to recruit the Notch-cutting enzyme to the immunological synapse. Further analysis revealed that Notch gets cut and activated during the first few minutes of T cell activation leading to cell division and the development of effector T cells."

To allow physiological adaptation, the TCR signal is modulated by co-regulatory signals. Here, we address co-stimulation through Notch. Notch family proteins are large, heterodimeric transmembrane receptors. Upon Notch ligation by one of a family of Notch ligands (<a href=\"#bib28\">Osborne and Minter, 2007</a>), a plasma membrane-tethered matrix metalloproteinase, ADAM10 or ADAM17, removes the Notch extracellular domain. Subsequently, the plasma membrane-embedded \u03b3-secretase complex liberates the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The NICD constitutively translocates to the nucleus where it displaces transcriptional repressors and recruits enhancers to genomic loci characterized by binding of the transcription factor RPBJ\u03ba (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borggrefe and Oswald, 2009</a>)."

Notch1 signaling also plays a pivotal role in mature T cells. Notch1 is activated following TCR stimulation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amsen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Guy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ong et al., 2008</a>) and is required for effector cell development (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amsen et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Keerthivasan et al., 2011</a>). The degree of Notch1 activation is directly proportional to the strength of the TCR signal (<a href=\"#bib12\">Guy et al., 2013</a>). Antigen-induced Notch1 activation in T cells may be ligand independent (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adler et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ayaz and\u00a0Osborne, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Palaga et al., 2003</a>). However, the cellular mechanism coupling proximal T cell signaling to Notch activation is unresolved. Here we reveal a spatially constrained mechanism of Notch1 activation. We demonstrate that PKC\u03b8, a serine/threonine kinase integrating TCR and CD28 signals (<a href=\"#bib2\">Altman and Kong, 2016</a>), enhances T cell actin dynamics through localization and phosphorylation of the negative actin regulator Coronin1A (Coro 1A) and thus mediates actin-based recruitment of ADAM10 to the T cell:APC interface for efficient Notch activation."

NICD expression and changes thereof upon cellular activation were similar (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u00a0and\u00a0B</a>). However, Notch activation was impaired in mature T cells from Tg4<sup>KO</sup> mice. Tg4<sup>KO</sup> mice showed reduced Notch1 expression sixteen hours after in vivo T cell activation by injecting mice with 80 \u00b5g [4Y] peptide s.c. (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) even though Tg4<sup>KO</sup> mice were grossly normal with a reduced number and proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> splenocytes but unaffected Tg4 TCR expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Reduced Notch expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis 60 min after s.c. administration of [4Y] peptide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and through analysis of Notch1-dependent hes1 expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Corroborating these data in non-TCR transgenic T cells, Notch1 cleavage in na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD44<sup>\u2212</sup>, CD25<sup>\u2212</sup>) from PKC\u03b8-deficient B10.PL mice was diminished following overnight activation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Such Notch activation was CD28-dependent (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), consistent with an important role of PKC\u03b8 downstream of CD28 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Huang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kong et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yokosuka et al., 2008</a>). As biochemical signaling activity in T cell activation peaks within the first few minutes, we verified that PKC\u03b8-dependent Notch activation can also occur at this time scale. Increased nuclear Notch enrichment could be detected 5 to 20 min after in vitro T cell activation or after injecting mice with 80 \u00b5g [4Y] peptide s.c. (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G\u2013I</a>).

                                "text": "We investigated ADAM10 as a key signaling molecule potentially employed by PKC\u03b8 for Notch1 activation. We visualized ADAM10 recruitment to the interface between the T cell and the APC by virally transducing Tg4<sup>WT</sup> and Tg4<sup>KO</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with ADAM10-GFP. ADAM10-GFP<sup>+</sup> T cells were imaged as they interacted with H-2<sup>u</sup> PL8 lymphoma APC presenting the Ac1-9[4Y] antigen. Tg4<sup>KO</sup> T cells, whether transduced to express ADAM10-GFP or other sensors, formed tight cell couples upon APC contact albeit with a slightly reduced frequency compared to Tg4<sup>WT</sup> T cells (30 \u00b1 5% versus 50 \u00b1 4%, p=0.02) with comparable gross T cell morphology, as characterized in the next paragraph. Such effective cell coupling allowed an analysis of the interface recruitment of GFP-tagged signaling intermediates and the spatiotemporal patterns thereof. ADAM10-GFP was recruited rapidly and transiently to the interface of Tg4<sup>WT</sup> T cells and APC (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) consistent with previous work in AND T cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Guy et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, ADAM10-GFP was not enriched at the interface of Tg4<sup>KO</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). In Tg4<sup>WT</sup> cells, ADAM10 was enriched in the interface lamellum, an actin-based signaling structure (<a href=\"#bib35\">Roybal et al., 2015b</a>). Impairment of lamellum formation with 40 nM Jasplakinolide (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Roybal et al., 2015a</a>) prevented ADAM10 interface recruitment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and Notch cleavage following stimulation with anti-CD3/28 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The defect in lamellal ADAM10 recruitment upon PKC\u03b8-deficiency was selective since the lamellal accumulation of Themis, a protein with substantially more prominent and persistent lamellal accumulation than ADAM10, was only moderately impaired (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E</a>). Together, these data suggest that actin-dependent ADAM10 recruitment to the T cell:APC interface at the early peak of T cell signaling activity mediates efficient Notch1 activation downstream of PKC\u03b8. In AND T cells strong stimuli cause concerted accumulation of the TCR, Vav and Notch at the T cell/APC interface as related to efficient Notch activation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Guy et al., 2013</a>). Actin dynamics may thus mediate coordinated interface accumulation of both ADAM10 and Notch. It needs to be determined how PKC\u03b8 and Vav-dependent actin dynamics are related."

Coronin1A inhibits the Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib15\">Humphries et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Oku et al., 2005</a>) and regulates clearance of actin from the NK immune synapse (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mace and Orange, 2014</a>). Furthermore, Coronin is an established interactor with and substrate of PKC (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Siegmund et al., 2015</a>). Coronin1A was highly enriched at the interface of Tg4<sup>WT</sup> and Tg4<sup>KO</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Videos 5</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">6</a>). Similar to actin, Coronin1A spreading to the interface periphery was delayed in Tg4<sup>KO</sup> cells, leaving substantially more Coronin 1A in the lamellum. Given that Coronin 1A is a negative regulator of actin dynamics its enhanced enrichment in the lamellum is consistent with the concurrent, localized impairments in actin, T cell morphology and ADAM10 recruitment. As a specificity control, the spatiotemporal distribution of the dominant F-actin severing protein Cofilin (<a href=\"#bib33\">Roybal et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Singleton et al., 2011</a>) was unaffected by PKC\u03b8 deficiency (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

                                "text": "Next, we investigated phosphorylation of Coronin 1A by PKC\u03b8 in Tg4 T cells. Coronin activity is negatively regulated by serine/threonine phosphorylation, which can be induced by phorbol ester treatment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Oku et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2012</a>). To allow detection of changes in Coronin1A phosphorylation, we prevented Coronin1A dephosphorylation by treating cells with the phosphatase inhibitor Calyculin A (<a href=\"#bib25\">Oku et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2012</a>). Treating Tg4<sup>WT</sup> T cells with PMA and Calyculin A resulted in a shift in the ratio of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated Coronin1A from 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 to 2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1 fold, indicative of efficient Coronin1A phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). This shift was significantly (p&lt;0.05) smaller in Tg4<sup>KO</sup> cells (0.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 to 0.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25 fold) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>) demonstrating that PKC\u03b8 is required for efficient PMA-induced phosphorylation of Coronin1A. Together, our data suggest (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) that in Tg4<sup>WT</sup> T cells PKC\u03b8 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>) inactivates Coronin 1A selectively in the region of most intense stimulating signaling, i.e. the center of the T cell:APC interface with effects extending across the entire lamellum but not reaching the peripheral actin ring. Thus PKC\u03b8 locally inhibits Coronin 1A-mediated attenuation of actin dynamics, promoting the formation of a strong actin-based lamellum. With regard to Notch1 activation this allows for the efficient actin-driven recruitment of ADAM10 to the T cell:APC interface. This mechanism of enhanced Notch processing peaks within the first few minutes of T cell activation. Such early signaling emphasis is consistently observed in Tg4<sup>WT</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and other TCR transgenic systems, where it extends to the nuclear localization of other transcription factors, NFAT and NF\u03baB (<a href=\"#bib35\">Roybal et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Singleton et al., 2009</a>). We have thus identified a spatially restricted, actin-dependent mechanism of Notch activation downstream of PKC\u03b8 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Future work will determine how the enhancement of Notch activation by PKC\u03b8 is integrated with PKC\u03b8-dependent NF\u03baB activation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gruber et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sun et al., 2000</a>) in the regulation of T cell differentiation."

While causally connecting such divergent time scales is a great challenge, there is precedent. 15 min of contact between a primed T cell and a professional APC is sufficient to trigger T cell proliferation 24 hr later (<a href=\"#bib16\">Iezzi et al., 1998</a>). Similarly, 1 hr of ZAP-70 activity can trigger substantial negative selection (<a href=\"#bib4\">Au-Yeung et al., 2014</a>). Differential signaling kinetics may also regulate Treg induction (<a href=\"#bib23\">Miskov-Zivanov et al., 2013</a>). On an even shorter time scale 5 min of TGF\u03b2 incubation saturates Smad2 phosphorylation at 1 hr (<a href=\"#bib46\">Viz\u00e1n et al., 2013</a>). In T cell activation, it has been argued that a time delay in the onset of activating versus inhibitory signaling from 2\u00a0to more than 5 min, respectively, may play an important role in the induction of anergy in response to high doses of antigen (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wolchinsky et al., 2014</a>). In B cells a single pulse of BCR engagement can trigger the\u00a0nuclear accumulation of NF\u03baB for 6 hr (<a href=\"#bib9\">Damdinsuren et al., 2010</a>). While mechanisms linking rapid proximal signaling to later cell function largely remain to be determined, the well-supported existence of such causal links is consistent with our model of PKC\u03b8-dependent Notch activation."

Using FACS, GFP<sup>+</sup> transductants were sorted to a five-fold range of expression around 2 \u00b5M, the lowest concentration visible by microscopy and often within the range of endogenous protein amounts (<a href=\"#bib33\">Roybal et al., 2016</a>). PL8 cells were pre-loaded with 10 \u00b5g/ml [4Y] for\u00a0&gt;4 hr and combined with pre-sorted GFP<sup>+</sup> Tg4 T cells in a glass-bottom plate on the stage of a spinning disk microscope system (UltraVIEW 6FE system, Perkin Elmer; DMI6000 microscope, Leica; CSU22 spinning disk, Yokogawa). GFP data were collected as 21 z-sections at 1 \u00b5m intervals every 20 s. All imaging was performed at 37\u2070C in PBS containing 10% FCS, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Images were exported in TIFF format and analyzed with the Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). Cell couples were identified using the differential interference contrast (DIC) bright field images. The subcellular localization of GFP-tagged protein sensors at each time point was classified into one of six previously defined stereotypical patterns (<a href=\"#bib42\">Singleton et al., 2009</a>) that reflect cell biological structures driving signaling organization (<a href=\"#bib36\">Roybal et al., 2013</a>). Briefly, interface enrichment of fluorescent proteins at less than 35% of the cellular background was classified as no accumulation. For enrichment above 35% the six, mutually exclusive interface patterns were: accumulation in a large protein complex at the center of the T cell:APC interface (central), accumulation in a large T cell invagination (invagination), accumulation that covered the cell cortex across central and peripheral regions (diffuse), accumulation in a broad actin-based interface lamellum (lamellum), accumulation at the periphery of the interface (peripheral) or in smaller membrane protrusions (asymmetric)."

A finding further confirmed by analysis of Notch1-dependent hes1 expression. There is a concern regarding the level of Hes1 activation in relation to cells that utilise bona fide ligand dependent Notch signalling, such as thymocytes, and using thymocytes from the same mouse strains as positive controls would be helpful to put this in perspective. Following CD3 + CD28 stimulation for 18 hours, naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from B10.PL mice deprived of PKCq showed reduced Notch1 cleavage. This cleavage occurred within a time frame compatible with TCR signalling. T cell proliferation, CD69 and c-Myc upregulation and Th17 development were defective in Tg4KO T cells whereas IL-2 and Th1 cell differentiation were unaffected. Importantly, constitutive activation of Notch in Tg4KO cells restored T cell proliferation and Th17 cell differentiation. The authors admit that this is an over-expression experiment, but it would be helpful to see the level of expression, normalised to cell number, for early DN thymocytes, mature T cells undergoing activation and the retrovirally transduced cells. Visualization of ADAM10 at the T cell-APC interface showed that it was recruited rapidly and transiently to interfaces involving of Tg4WT T cells but not Tg4KO T cells. Therefore, the actin-dependent (Jasplakinolide sensitive) early recruitment of ADAM10 to the T cell-APC interface likely contributes to efficient Notch1 activation downstream of PKC There is a concern as to how jJasplakinolide, a non-specific F-actin stabilizer, can be used in this manner without inhibiting synapse formation \u2013 it would be useful to see titration data to better understand the degree to which the width of the optimum Jasplakinolide concentration for this effect \u03b8. Treating Tg4<sup>WT</sup> T cells with PMA and Calyculin A \u2013 a phosphatase inhibitor \u2013 resulted in PKCq-dependent Coronin1A phosphorylation. There was a concern that a Calyculin A alone condition was not shown and whether or not PMA is required to see the increase phosphorylation. This gel shown is also sub-optimal due to artefacts and repeating this with the additional condition will also provide an opportunity to improve the quality of the data. This led the authors to propose that PKC\u03b8q enhances T cell actin dynamics through co-localization with and phosphorylation of the negative actin regulator Coronin1A, thereby mediating actin-based recruitment of ADAM10 to the T cell-APC interface and efficient Notch activation."

As previously communicated with the editorial office, Christoph Wuelfing and colleagues recently published a paper in which they conducted a titration of this drug using similar TCR transgenic T cells (5CC7). This paper (Roybal et al. PLOS ONE 10 (8) e0133231) addresses the questions raised by the reviewer. Furthermore, we have shown that 5CC7 and Tg4, the TCR transgenic used in this study, behave identically in cell coupling assays when treated with the drug. The cell coupling-frequencies of Jasplakinolide-treated Tg4 cells, shown relative to 5CC7, are added in the text and are displayed in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>. The relevance of the comparative data is referred to in the legend to <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>. In summary, the cell coupling data shown in this figure establish that Tg4 and 5C.C7 T cells respond comparably to increasing concentrations of Jasplakinolide. The extensive characterization of the effect of 40 nM Jasplakinolide on T cell actin dynamics in (Roybal et al., 2015a) therefore applies to the Tg4<sup>WT</sup> T cells."
