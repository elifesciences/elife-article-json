                    "text": "The unconventional secretory pathway exports proteins that bypass the endoplasmic reticulum. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, conditions that trigger Acb1 secretion via this pathway generate a Grh1 containing compartment composed of vesicles and tubules surrounded by a cup-shaped membrane and collectively called CUPS. Here we report a quantitative assay for Acb1 secretion that reveals requirements for ESCRT-I, -II, and -III but, surprisingly, without the involvement of the Vps4 AAA-ATPase. The major ESCRT-III subunit Snf7 localizes transiently to CUPS and this was accelerated in <i>vps4</i>\u0394 cells, correlating with increased Acb1 secretion. Microscopic analysis suggests that, instead of forming intraluminal vesicles with the help of Vps4, ESCRT-III/Snf7 promotes direct engulfment of preexisting Grh1 containing vesicles and tubules into a saccule to generate a mature Acb1 containing compartment. This novel multivesicular / multilamellar compartment, we suggest represents the stable secretory form of CUPS that is competent for the release of Acb1 to cells exterior."

In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, conditions that trigger Acb1 secretion via this pathway generate a Grh1 containing compartment composed of vesicles and tubules surrounded by a cup-shaped membrane and collectively called CUPS. Here we report a quantitative assay for Acb1 secretion that reveals requirements for ESCRT-I, -II, and -III but, surprisingly, without the involvement of the Vps4 AAA-ATPase. The major ESCRT-III subunit Snf7 localizes transiently to CUPS and this was accelerated in <i>vps4</i>\u0394 cells, correlating with increased Acb1 secretion. Microscopic analysis suggests that, instead of forming intraluminal vesicles with the help of Vps4, ESCRT-III/Snf7 promotes direct engulfment of preexisting Grh1 containing vesicles and tubules into a saccule to generate a mature Acb1 containing compartment. This novel multivesicular / multilamellar compartment, we suggest represents the stable secretory form of CUPS that is competent for the release of Acb1 to cells exterior."

How are these proteins that cannot enter the endoplasmic reticulum - Golgi complex pathway of protein secretion exported from cells? Is there a common pathway of their export? Does their release from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space involve a membrane bounded vesicular intermediate or are they translocated directly from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space via a translocator? Progress in our understanding of these issues of fundamental importance has been slow because these proteins are released in exceptionally small quantities in a cell type specific and a signal dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib38\">Malhotra, 2013</a>). This class of proteins is typically detected in the extracellular space by a functional bioassay or ELISA, but these assays do not distinguish between processes involved in the secretion of full-length proteins from those that process the respective cargoes for their presentation in a functional active form. These technical limitations have hampered our understanding of the mechanism of unconventional protein secretion."

In the extracellular space, AcbA is proteolytically processed into a 34 amino acid peptide, SDF-2 (spore differentiation factor 2). SDF-2 is required for rapid encapsulation of the prespore cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anjard and Loomis, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Anjard et al., 1998</a>). Subsequent analysis revealed that secretion of AcbA orthologs of the yeasts <i>Saccharaomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Pichia pastoris</i> also required GrhA ortholog called Grh1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duran et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Manjithaya et al., 2010</a>). In addition, a subset of genes that ordinarily function in the biogenesis of multi-vesicular body (MVB), targeting of membranes to endosomes, fusion of membranes with the plasma membrane, and autophagosome formation were also required for Acb1 secretion (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duran et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Manjithaya et al., 2010</a>). However, the secretion of Acb1 was measured by an assay that detected the activity of SDF-2 or an SDF-2-like peptide. This procedure does not distinguish proteins required directly for Acb1 secretion from those with a role in its modification or processing to generate a functional SDF-2. In our subsequent analyses, we discovered that Grh1, upon incubation of yeast in starvation medium, translocated from its normal ER exit site/early Golgi residence to one or two larger membrane bound compartments. Based on the shape of the membranes containing Grh1, we have called these compartments CUPS (Compartment for Unconventional Protein Secretion) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bruns et al., 2011</a>). In addition to Grh1, CUPS contain the early Golgi components Bug1, Uso1 and Sed5, but form independent of COPII and COPI dependent vesicular transport (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cruz-Garcia et al., 2014</a>). The biogenesis of CUPS requires the PI 4-kinase Pik1 and the Arf-GEF Sec7. Interestingly, in a <i>vps34\u0394</i> mutant CUPS form but breakdown indicating the requirement of PI3P production by Vps34 in the stability of the CUPS (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bruns et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cruz-Garcia et al., 2014</a>)."

In contrast neither ESCRT-0 nor Vps4 are required for this process. These results indicate a Vps4 independent role of ESCRT-III in membrane remodeling. We present the ultra structural analysis of CUPS and the findings that Snf7, the ESCRT-III component, attaches to CUPS during maturation and is required for their stability. The stable CUPS are found to contain Acb1. The description and the significance of our findings follow."

We reasoned that full-length Acb1 was likely secreted into the periplasmic space that is between plasma membrane and the cell wall and this pool was cleaved to generate SDF-2. Once processed, SDF-2 could diffuse into the medium because of its small size (34 amino acids) and/or charge. The cell wall of yeast is composed of glucans, chitin and an outer layer of highly negatively-charged mannoproteins (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lipke and Ovalle, 1998</a>).

In fact, this procedure has been used to report the secretion of signal sequence lacking gluconeogenic, glycolytic enzymes, and the exogenously expressed human Galectin-1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cleves et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Giardina et al., 2014</a>). But how much of these proteins are released as a result of cell lysis by this procedure?"

After 2.5\u2009hr equal number of growing and starved cells were harvested. The cell wall was extracted by the standard procedure for removal of non-covalently bound proteins by incubation with a pH 9.4 Tris-HCl buffer in combination with reducing agents and mixing at 37\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cleves et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Giardina et al., 2014</a>). The proteins extracted under these conditions were analyzed by western blotting with anti-Acb1 and Cof1 antibodies, respectively. The results revealed high levels of Cof1 and Acb1 in the cell wall extracts of both growing and starved cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), suggesting partial cell lysis. We therefore modified the procedure and incubated cells in pH 9.4 Tris-HCl buffer without reducing agents and in the presence of 2% sorbitol to protect against the osmotic stress resulting from loosening the cell wall. The mixture was kept on ice to further preserve the integrity of the plasma membrane. Under these conditions Acb1, but not Cof1, was detected in the cell wall extract of starving cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Next we monitored secretion of Acb1 during starvation over time comparing cell wall extracts of growing cells and cells starved for up to 4\u2009hr. The spore viability assay previously indicated a burst in SDF-2 activity at 2.5\u2009hr post-induction of starvation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duran et al., 2010</a>). Consistently, secretion of full-length Acb1 into the cell wall/periplasm followed similar dynamics, peaking at 3\u2009hr of starvation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The levels of a soluble cell wall protein, Bgl2, were also analyzed as a marker of cell wall extraction efficiency. The amount of Bgl2 extracted from starved cells remained constant throughout starvation, indicating that secretion of Acb1 increased during starvation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The levels of cell wall extracted and lysate Acb1 were quantitated and the amount of Acb1 secreted after 3\u2009hr of starvation was calculated to be on average 1% of the total intracellular Acb1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This procedure to detect Acb1 is not without limitations however. Culturing cells at 37\u00b0C, prior to extraction, resulted in Cof1 release (data not shown), which precludes testing of temperature-sensitive yeast mutants for their involvement in Acb1 secretion. High concentrations of DMSO, which is often used as a solvent to dissolve chemicals such as Latrunculin A or Brefeldin A, also led to Cof1 release (data not shown). Therefore, DMSO soluble chemical inhibitors, in general, cannot be tested for their effects on Acb1 secretion. Finally, some yeast mutant strains are hyper osmosensitive and cannot therefore be tested by our procedure as they reveal a persistent Cof1 signal upon cell wall extraction. Regardless of these caveats, this assay for the first time provides a quantitative and a reliable measure of Acb1 secretion."

We assessed whether ESCRT proteins affected CUPS absorption into the ER upon re-growth. The same cells as above were starved for 2.5\u2009hr and then incubated in growth medium for 45\u2009min. The wild type cells revealed the expected relocation of Grh1-2xGFP to ER exit sites/early Golgi membranes. This relocation was unaffected by loss of any ESCRT protein, including Vps4 (data not shown and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Therefore, CUPS maturation during starvation depends on ESCRT-II and III complex members, but CUPS reabsorption into the ER upon re-growth is independent of ESCRT proteins."

                                "text": "Loss of Snf7 exhibited a strong defect in CUPS morphology after 2.5\u2009hr of starvation, and because it is the most abundant ESCRT-III protein, contributing 50% of the predicted 450\u00a0kDa ESCRT-III complex, we decided to localize Snf7 in starving cells (<a href=\"#bib57\">Teis et al., 2008</a>). The C-terminal fusion of bulky tags such as GFP or RFP to all four ESCRT-III subunits is known to act as dominant-negative with respect to MVB sorting by interfering with auto inhibition of the C-terminal tail (<a href=\"#bib57\">Teis et al., 2008</a>). We examined Grh1-2xGFP localization when Snf7-RFP was integrated in the genome and found it also acted as dominant-negative with respect to CUPS stability, exhibiting the same phenotype as loss of Snf7 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Snf7-RFP localized to multiple punctate elements, representing dysfunctional MVBs. Interestingly, upon starvation, the Grh1 and Snf7 containing structures were often juxtaposed or slightly overlapping (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). An established procedure to overcome this inhibitory effects is to co-express wild type and Snf7-RFP in the same cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guizetti et al., 2011</a>). To ensure that co-expression of Snf7-RFP did not affect MVB pathway we assessed the trafficking of MVB cargo Cps1 in cells expressing empty vector or Snf7-RFP under the control of its own promoter. Our findings reveal that expression of Snf7-RFP did not block trafficking of GFP-Cps1 to the vacuole (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We therefore co-expressed exogenous Snf7-GFP with untagged endogenous Snf7 in cells expressing Grh1-2xmCherry. Under these conditions CUPS formation after 2.5\u2009hr of starvation was largely restored, with more than 70% of cells exhibiting morphological normal CUPS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In growth conditions, Snf7-GFP localized to small punctate elements and the vacuole membrane (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The vacuole membrane location is likely a result of inefficient disassembly of tagged Snf7. Upon starvation, Snf7 localized predominantly to 1\u20133 large structures per cell, and the vacuole membrane labeling was largely reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Cells with very high Snf7-GFP expression displayed altered CUPS morphology (data not shown), we therefore focused on cells that exhibited normal CUPS and found that ~15% of such cells co-localized Snf7-GFP to Grh1-2xmCherry containing CUPS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). To further ascertain the location and dynamics of Snf7 to Grh1 containing CUPS, we performed time-lapse confocal imaging during starvation. Our results showed that Snf7 and Grh1 exist on separate compartments for the majority of the time during starvation. However, these compartments periodically contacted and/or coalesced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013D</a>). Quantitative analysis of cells with Snf7-GFP expression and Grh1-2xmCherry on CUPS indicated that co-localization occurred transiently only after 1\u2009hr of starvation (see also <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Between 1 and 2.5\u2009hr of starvation, analysis of 62 cells revealed Snf7 and Grh1 compartments co-localized or overlapped rapidly 17 times in 17 different cells for 10\u201320 s. Interestingly, between 2.5 and 3\u2009hr of starvation, the time when Acb1 secretion peaks, analysis of 96 cells revealed 37 co-localization events in 25 cells, meaning co-localization was observed more than once per cell in some cases. Of these 37 co-localization events, 22 were rapid, lasting only 10\u201330 s (examples shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013D</a>, arrowheads), while 15 were stable, sometimes lasting for up to 10-minutes (examples shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013D</a>, arrows). In summary, the frequency and duration of co-localization increased throughout starvation, correlating with both the timing of Acb1 secretion and the requirement of Snf7 in CUPS stability but not with the initial steps of CUPS biogenesis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). Due to photo bleaching, it was not possible to visualize the same cell throughout the time-course of starvation. Despite this, from the combined data we propose that all CUPS at one point contact or fuse with the Snf7 containing compartment and this is necessary for the final step of maturing CUPS into a secretion competent organelle. In the absence of Snf7, this final maturation might be blocked and Grh1 containing CUPS disintegrate. One possibility is that Snf7 is required for sealing of the membranes that compose CUPS to generate a compartment sealed from the cytoplasm."

In wild type cells, Snf7-RFP localization changes to 1\u20133 prominent foci with reduced vacuole membrane staining (see also <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>). As mentioned above, we observed mild perturbation in CUPS formation in wild type cells expressing Snf7-RFP. Similarly, Snf7-RFP expression exacerbated the defects in CUPS morphology in most ESCRT mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Even loss of ESCRT-I components, which normally did not appear to affect CUPS morphology, resulted in more cells with incomplete CUPS formation upon Snf7-RFP expression. Similar to the situation in growth conditions, ESCRT-I mutants displayed more cytosolic distribution of Snf7-RFP and there was no vacuole membrane localization compared to wild type cells. This suggests that, as in growth, Snf7 recruitment to membranes is impaired in these cells upon starvation. However, Snf7 was recruited to 1\u20132 foci in some cells, although less efficiently, and this could, at times, be co-localized to Grh1 containing CUPS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This is expected, as loss of Snf7 recruitment should lead to breakdown of CUPS. The CUPS morphology was severely affected in ESCRT-II mutants and <i>vps20\u0394</i> cells.

We therefore performed time-lapse confocal imaging as in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and found Snf7 was recruited to CUPS membranes much earlier in starvation than in wild type cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We examined wild type and <i>vps4\u0394</i> cells exogenously expressing Snf7-RFP during the first hour of starvation. In wild type cells there was no detectable localization of Snf7-RFP to CUPS, consistent with our findings in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. Specifically, analysis of 65 wild type cells between 10 and 50\u2009min of starvation revealed no co-localization of Grh1 and Snf7 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> \u2013 WT 25\u2009min). In fact, Snf7 foci had not completely formed as later in starvation, while in <i>vps4\u0394</i> cells Snf7 localized almost exclusively to such foci (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Analysis of 72 <i>vps4\u0394</i> cells between 10 and 50\u2009min of starvation revealed Snf7 localized to CUPS in 20 cells (in 2 cases twice per cell), usually rapidly, for 10\u201330 s (example shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> \u2013 <i>vps4\u0394</i> 15\u00a0min \u2013 arrowheads). We observed 2 stable co-localization events but these were associated to larger Snf7 accumulations (example shown <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> \u2013 <i>vps4\u0394</i> 20\u2009min \u2013 arrow). Later in starvation there was no appreciable difference in the frequency or duration of Snf7 localization to CUPS in wild type versus <i>vps4\u0394</i> cells (data not shown). Therefore Snf7 recruitment to CUPS is accelerated in <i>vps4\u0394</i> cells."

After 1\u2009hr starvation wild type cells had secreted very little Acb1, whereas <i>vps4\u0394</i> cells secreted more than two fold more Acb1 at this time point (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>).

We expressed wild type or mutated Snf7 in <i>snf7\u0394</i> cells and examined Acb1 secretion after 2.5\u2009hr of starvation. Cells expressing empty vector or Snf7-L121D were unable to secrete Acb1, in contrast to cells expressing wild type Snf7 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013E</a>). Therefore the ability of Snf7 to polymerize into filaments is required for Acb1 secretion, although Vps4 mediated disassembly is not. In fact, inhibiting the latter leads to slightly accelerated secretion."

The stable CUPS are double membrane bounded and contain internal membranes of different sizes and shapes. An MVB on the other hand, is composed of a single bilayer containing uniformed sized vesicles.

While a number of issues on the role of exosomes in secretion remain unclear, our new findings strongly indicate that canonical MVBs are not involved in Acb1 secretion. Acb1 secretion requires ESCRT-I, -II and -III proteins but not ESCRT-0 or Vps4 proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The lack of ESCRT-0 involvement is not surprising as its main function is to recognize transmembrane MVB cargoes. Moreover, other ESCRT dependent membrane fission events, such as HIV budding, cytokinesis and nuclear envelope re-sealing after mitosis also require only a subset of ESCRT proteins and are independent of ESCRT-0 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Morita et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Garrus et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Vietri et al., 2015</a>).

The lack of requirement for ESCRT-0 and Vps4 in CUPS formation correlates with our secretion data indicating these proteins, and thereby the MVB pathway, are not required for Acb1 secretion.

We do not know the origin of the saccular membrane, but our findings strongly suggest that acquisition of Acb1 into the secretory pathway is post-production of Grh1 containing vesicular membranes. One possibility is that Acb1 is attached to the saccule that engulfs Grh1 containing membranes and this casing of saccule is sealed by an\u00a0Snf7 dependent reaction to produce a compartment whose contents are separated from the cytoplasm. This doubled membrane bounded multivesicular / multilamellar compartment is clearly morphologically distinct from an MVB, that is composed of a single membranes containing uniformed sized vesicles. Moreover its formation is different from the mechanism by which cells produce an MVB. The role of Vps4 in the biogenesis of these compartments is the most significant difference. While Vps4 is required for MVB biogenesis, it is not involved in mature CUPS formation. We call this compartment stable CUPS to distinguish them from the collection of Grh1 containing vesicles and tubules that are observed at 30\u2009min post starvation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>).

Briefly, the arrestin-like protein Rim8 is recruited to plasma membrane via the plasma membrane sensor Rim21 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Obara et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Obara and Kihara, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Herrador et al., 2010</a>). Rim8 directly recruits Vps23 of ESCRT-I, bypassing ESCRT-0 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Herrador et al., 2010</a>). This ultimately leads to ESCRT-III dependent recruitment of a protease (Rim13) that cleaves a transcription factor (Rim 101), which then regulates the genes that provide protection from the elevated pH (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lamb et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Weiss et al., 2009</a>). This process is independent of ESCRT-0 but always active in the absence of Vps2, Vps24 or Vps4, which cause constitutive recruitment and cleavage of Rim101 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hayashi et al., 2005</a>). Acb1 secretion and CUPS formation is also independent of ESCRT-0, but do require Vps2/24 proteins. Although Vps4 is not required for Acb1 secretion or CUPS formation, the loss of Vps4 does not induce Acb1 secretion or CUPS formation in growing conditions. We did, however, observe modest acceleration of Acb1 secretion and Snf7 recruitment to CUPS upon starvation in <i>vps4\u0394</i> cells. It is therefore unclear whether the conditions that trigger Acb1 secretion are similar to cellular response to pH alterations. Moreover, we have tested loss of Rim8, Rim21 and Rim101 directly for Acb1 secretion and unfortunately these gene deletions caused extensive cell lysis thereby precluding their evaluation in Acb1 secretion by our cell wall extraction assay (data not shown). Clearly, the mechanism by which cells sense and signal in response to nutrient starvation to generate CUPS and promote Acb1 secretion is an interesting challenge and might well share some genetic requirements of the other well known signaling pathways such as the high pH triggered Rim signaling pathway."

                                "text": "Our findings indicate that Grh1 containing membranes, after their production by COPI and COPII independent reaction (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cruz-Garcia et al., 2014</a>) are first collected into a focus and then appear more tubulo vesicular (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> \u2013 immature CUPS). These membranes then grow and appear to be more connected. The phagophores implicated by us previously (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duran et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bruns et al., 2011</a>), and described recently by Schekman and colleagues, could represent these immature CUPS structures. Our data reveal that Grh1 containing membranes (immature CUPS) are encased in a saccule by Snf7 dependent process. This step is required for full maturation of CUPS. We call this compartment stable CUPS that contain Acb1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). We speculate that this compartment might be the functional ortholog of the amphisomes proposed by Schekman and colleagues for IL-1\u00df secretion. Built into this common theme are also other features with respect to specific cargoes that might utilize different chaperones and means for their capture into the starting stage (the vesicles), which could explain the utility of ESCRT-0 for IL1\u00df, but not Acb1 secretion. It is important to note that the compartments of this pathway do not need to be identical in organization and shape: the yeast Golgi membranes do not appear anything like the Golgi stacks of higher eukaryotes. So the overall - evolving - pathway of unconventional protein secretion is likely more similar than presently appreciated. Importantly, this pathway does not use the conventional Vps4 and MVB mediated release of exosomes into the extracellular space."

All strains are derived from the BY4741 background (<i>MATa his3\u22061 leu2\u22060 met15\u22060 ura3\u22060</i>). Deletion strains were from the EUROSCARF collection with individual genes replaced by KanMx4. Strains expressing C-terminally 2xyeGFP- and/or 2xyomCherry-tagged Grh1 were constructed by a PCR-based targeted homologous recombination and have been described previously (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cruz-Garcia et al., 2014</a>). The Snf7-RFP strain was a kind gift from Dr. Erin O\u2019Shea (Harvard University). All subsequent strains were generated by mating and sporulation, followed by selection of clones with appropriate markers, and confirmation of haploidy. The pRS415-GFP-Cps1 under the control of its own was provided by David Teis. The pRS416-Snf7-GFP expressed from its own promoter was kindly provided by Dr. Scott Emr (Cornell University, Ithaca, USA). The Snf7-RFP expression construct was generated by PCR amplification of Snf7, with its own promoter, mRFP tag and ADH1 terminator sequences from genomic DNA derived from the Snf7-RFP strain and ultimately cloned into pRS416. Similarly, to generate Snf7-L121D construct, Snf7 with its own promoter and terminator was first amplified from wild type genomic DNA and cloned into pRS416. The latter was mutated using the Gibson assembly method to change codon 121 from CTT to GAT (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gibson et al., 2009</a>). SnapGene software (from GSL Biotech, Chicago, IL; available at www.snapgene.com) was used for molecular cloning design."

Concomitant to this, growing cells were diluted in SC medium, continued growing in logarithmic phase and 15 OD<sub>600</sub> units were harvested as before. The cell wall extraction buffer (100\u00a0mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 2% sorbitol) was always prepared fresh before use and kept on ice. To ensure no loss of cells and to avoid cell contamination in the extracted buffer, 2\u00a0mL tubes were siliconized\u00a0with\u00a0Sigmacote (SIGMA-Aldrich) prior to collection. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000xg for 3 min at 4\u00b0C, medium or potassium acetate was removed and 1.5\u00a0mL of cold extraction buffer was added. Cells were resuspended gently by inversion and incubated on ice for 10 min, after which they were centrifuged as before, 3000xg for 3 min at 4\u00b0C, and 1.3\u00a0mL of extraction buffer was removed to ensure no cell contamination. The remaining buffer was removed and the cells were resuspended in 0.75\u00a0mL of cold TE buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, EDTA) with protease inhibitors (aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin [SIGMA-Aldrich]) and 10\u00a0\u03bcL was boiled directly in 90\u00a0\u03bcL of 2x sample buffer (lysate). To the extracted protein fraction, 30\u00a0\u03bcg of BSA (bovine serum albumin [SIGMA-Aldrich]) carrier protein was added and 0.2\u00a0mL of 100% Trichloroacetic acid (SIGMA-Aldrich). Proteins were precipitated on ice for 1\u2009hr, centrifuged 16,000xg for 30 min and boiled in 45\u00a0\u03bcL 2x sample buffer. For detection, proteins (10\u00a0\u03bcL each of lysate or wall fractions) were separated in a 16.5% Tris-tricine peptide gel (Bio-Rad) allowing separation of Cof1 (15.kDa) from Acb1 (10.kDa), before transfer to nitrocellulose. Rabbit anti-Cof1 antibody was a generous gift from Dr.\u00a0John Cooper (Washington University in St. Louis, USA). Rabbit anti-Bgl2 was a gift from Dr.\u00a0Randy Schekman (UC Berkeley, CA, USA). Rabbit anti-Acb1 antibody was generated by inoculating rabbits with recombinant, untagged Acb1, purified from bacteria. Specificity of the serum was confirmed by testing lysates prepared from <i>acb1\u0394</i> cells."

Freeze-substitution with 0.1% Uranyl Acetate in acetone and embedding in Lowicryl resin was performed in an AFS2 machine (Leica microsystems) as described in (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kukulski et al., 2011</a>). 300\u00a0nm thick sections were cut from the polymerized resin block and picked up on carbon coated mesh grids. 50 nm TetraSpeck fluorescent microspheres (Lifetechnologies,\u00a0Carlsbad, CA, USA) were adsorbed to the grid for the subsequent fiducial-based correlation between light and electron microscopy images. The fluorescence microscopy (FM) imaging of the sections was carried out as previously described (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kukulski et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Avinoam et al., 2015</a>) using a widefield fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX81) equipped with an Olympus PlanApo 100X 1.45 NA oil immersion objective. Images were collected with mcherry-specific settings as well as in the green channel (Tetraspecks could be distinguished from the mcherry-specific signal by their fluorescence in both channels). Grids were then incubated with 10\u00a0nm protein A-coupled gold beads and stained with Uranyl Acetate and Reynolds lead citrate. Tilt series were then acquired with a FEI Tecnai F30 electron microscope. Lower magnification series (3900X) for tetraspecs-based correlation as well as high magnification series (20000X) were acquired. Tomograms were then reconstructed using the IMOD software package (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kremer et al., 1996</a>). Areas of interest were identified with a fiducial-based correlation performed as described previously using in-house written MATLAB scripts (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kukulski et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">2012</a>). Briefly, the position of Tetraspeck microspheres was manually assigned in both the FM and low magnification EM images. The coordinate of fiducials pairs in the two imaging modalities were used to calculate a linear transformation, which allowed to map the coordinates of the fluorescent spot of interest on the electron tomogram. The gold beads were then used to calculate the transformation between low and high magnification tomograms, therefore allowing the overlay of the FM image with the high resolution tomogram. Once the Grh1-2xmCherry fluorescent signal was mapped on the high magnification tomogram, the membranes in the area of interest were manually segmented with IMOD and a 3D model was reconstructed."

The cover letter by Dr. Malhotra lists the changes in the revision, including the elimination of Mup1 trafficking data that conflicted with results published previously by another lab. A substantial addition to the revised manuscript is immuno EM, which supports a model in which the Acb1 cargo protein localizes to CUPS at a late stage during the maturation of this compartment. Only images are provided, however; a quantitative analysis of this pattern of localization seems not to have been performed. The timing of cargo deposition is relatively important to the authors' model that Snf7/ESCRT-III function is required for CUPS maturation \u2013 the envelopment of CUPS tubules and vesicles by the membranous saccule. The notion inferred by this reviewer is that Snf7/ESCRT-III function is needed for the saccule to capture cargo together with the immature CUPS membrane structures (a process, by the way, conceptually the same as Snf7/ESCRT-III assembly at endosomes serving to capture transmembrane protein cargoes at the site of ILV budding, first described by Teis et al., 2008 [10.1016/j.devcel.2008.08.013]). The model depicted in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> is also not wholly supported because the immuno EM experiments did not include snf7-deleted cells: the expectation from the model is that no cargo (Acb1) localization with immature CUPS membranes will be seen. In the same vein, given that the authors go to such length pointing out that CUPS maturation does not require Vps4, it seems they would have shown EM of mature CUPS in vps4-deleted cells to confirm their point beyond the localization of marker proteins using light microscopy. Indeed, in this light, the title of their manuscript seems not fully supported."

The shift in Snf7-RFP in WT cells from vacuolar membranes (during growth) to puncta (during starvation) is obvious and provides a compelling case that starvation mobilizes Snf7 for other means. The Snf7-RFP-positive puncta (in wild-type cells that have been starved) are not positive for Grh1-GFP, which would seem to undermine the model that starvation repurposes Snf7 toward CUPS maturation, but Snf7-Grh1 is shown by the authors to occur transiently in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> (which is carried over from the previous version of the manuscript)."

To be fair, however, the nature of Snf7/ESCRT-III function is poorly understood in all pathways in which it is involved. The new data in the revised manuscript comes closer to addressing the earlier criticism that it was unclear whether Snf7 was required directly or indirectly for unconventional protein secretion. While a 'smoking gun' result is not quite in hand, all of the genetic analyses support a direct role, and the EM studies now focus on CUPS maturation, a role conceptually the same as Snf7/ESCRT-III being required for endosomal maturation."

Previous studies done by the Malhotra lab indicated a CUPS structure positive for Grh1 essential for the secretion of Acb1. In addition, molecular machineries related to MVB, such as ESCRTs, and autophagy are also involved in the release of Acb1. The genuine requirement of these factors for the secretion of Acb1 is uncertain because the previous approach relied on a functional test of the active processed Acb1. A deficiency of Acb1 secretion in this assay is direct and may be caused be the defect of Acb1 processing instead of secretion. In the current work, the Malhotra lab optimized a previous protocol to partially open the cell wall of yeast to release the secreted Acb1 trapped between the plasma membrane and cell wall. Although this approach is limited to certain applications as indicated in the manuscript, the authors determined a direct requirement of ESCRTs in the secretion of Acb1. In contrast to the MVB pathway, the authors found that a different requirement of ESCRTs i.e. ESCRTs I-III, but not 0, are required for Acb1 secretion. Therefore, the involvement of ESCRTs could be a novel mechanism distinct from canonical one for MVB pathway. The authors then employed imaging studies to analyze the CUPS structure and found a dynamic relationship between Grh1 and SNF7 essential for the maintenance of CUPS. In summary the study further implies the involvement of ERSCRTs in the secretion of Acb1. The key point of the manuscript is an unconventional requirement of ESCRT complexes in unconventional secretion. However, most of the data is supporting this point is largely descriptive and the mechanistic insight is not sufficient. The author should consider deepening the mechanistic insight and enhancing the impact of the current data through the following points."

Not among the required genes is VPS4, which encodes the ATPase that mediates ESCRT-III disassembly. Because Vps4 and ESCRT-III are required in unison for all other described ESCRT-dependent processes (MVB sorting, cytokinesis, viral budding, and other events less well characterized), the authors contend that their study describes a novel case in which ESCRT-III functions independently of Vps4 regulation. However, this function is not determined in their manuscript. What the experiments show, instead, is a requirement for Snf7 (the principle subunit of ESCRT-III) at some stage during the biogenesis of CUPS, the membranous structure that arises when unconventional protein secretion of Acb1 is induced by starvation of yeast cells. Although how Snf7 is involved (directly or indirectly) in CUPS biogenesis is not determined, tomography of CUPS elements located in cells by CLEM suggests to the authors that Snf7 is required for maturation of nascent CUPS because cells deleted for SNF7 lack the membranous cisternae that wrap CUPS vesicles. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy are consistent with such a role for Snf7 because it transiently colocalizes with a CUPS marker (Grh1) upon starvation-induced Acb1 secretion."

The second statement that is difficult to support without knowing if ESCRTs have a direct role is the authors' conclusion \"that ESCRT-I likely functions to recruit Acb1 or an accessory component to the Snf7 compartment or CUPS without affecting their morphology.\" This supposition is based on light microscopy showing CUPS biogenesis is unaffected in the absence of ESCRT-I, and is interpreted in the light of ESCRT-I having a role in cargo recognition during MVB sorting."

Additional experiments looking at organelle morphology (the CUPS and adjacent Snf7-positive membranes) are presented as part of the effort to understand what this seemingly novel and non-canonical combination of ESCRT requirements reveals about the pathway responsible for unconventional secretion. The authors conclude that their studies convincingly rule out roles for \"ordinary\" MVB-like organelles in unconventional secretion and suggest that novel yet unclear roles for the required components of the ESCRT machinery must be at play.

Similarly, Baietti et al. (NCB 2012) simply examined exosome production and/or content as a read out and presented one fluorescence microscopy experiment which was based on a dysfunctional endosome. Nabbhan et al. (PNAS 2012), Jimenez et al. (Science 2012) and Webster et al.

However, we do not propose that Snf7 or ESCRTs must interact physically with Grh1, only that the compartments interact.

Our paper describes these processes in cells cultivated in potassium acetate. These are very different conditions, with the most obvious difference being the presence of glucose in the aforementioned studies, but not in ours. Moreover, we have already shown that CUPS formation is independent of Rapamycin treatment (Bruns et al., 2011), and although not published we have data that Acb1 secretion, similarly, is not triggered by Rapamycin treatment. So there is no issue with regards to a contradiction of the published work of Babst and colleagues."
