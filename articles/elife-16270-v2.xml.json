                    "text": "Mitosis occurs efficiently, but when it is disturbed or delayed, p53-dependent cell death or senescence is often triggered after mitotic exit. To characterize this process, we conducted CRISPR-mediated loss-of-function screens using a cell-based assay in which mitosis is consistently disturbed by centrosome loss. We identified 53BP1 and USP28 as essential components acting upstream of p53, evoking p21-dependent cell cycle arrest in response not only to centrosome loss, but also to other distinct defects causing prolonged mitosis. Intriguingly, 53BP1 mediates p53 activation independently of its DNA repair activity, but requiring its interacting protein USP28 that can directly deubiquitinate p53 in vitro and ectopically stabilize p53 in vivo. Moreover, 53BP1 can transduce prolonged mitosis to cell cycle arrest independently of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), suggesting that while SAC protects mitotic accuracy by slowing down mitosis, 53BP1 and USP28 function in parallel to select against disturbed or delayed mitosis, promoting mitotic efficiency."

To characterize this process, we conducted CRISPR-mediated loss-of-function screens using a cell-based assay in which mitosis is consistently disturbed by centrosome loss. We identified 53BP1 and USP28 as essential components acting upstream of p53, evoking p21-dependent cell cycle arrest in response not only to centrosome loss, but also to other distinct defects causing prolonged mitosis. Intriguingly, 53BP1 mediates p53 activation independently of its DNA repair activity, but requiring its interacting protein USP28 that can directly deubiquitinate p53 in vitro and ectopically stabilize p53 in vivo. Moreover, 53BP1 can transduce prolonged mitosis to cell cycle arrest independently of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), suggesting that while SAC protects mitotic accuracy by slowing down mitosis, 53BP1 and USP28 function in parallel to select against disturbed or delayed mitosis, promoting mitotic efficiency."

                        "text": "Mitosis is a critical cell cycle phase during which duplicated chromosomes are correctly separated into two identical units on the spindle, restoring genome integrity after cell division. Various mechanisms exist to ensure proper mitosis with high accuracy. During mitotic entry at the G2/M border, cells can abort the process and return to G2 in response to damages or stresses via the antephase checkpoint (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rieder and Cole, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Matsusaka and Pines, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rudner and Murray, 1996</a>). After committing to mitotic entry, the accuracy of chromosome segregation is further protected by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which functions to delay anaphase onset until all chromosomes or kinetochores are properly attached to spindle microtubules (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rieder and Cole, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2012</a>). A wide range of cellular stresses are known to directly or indirectly disturb spindle assembly or chromosome segregation, including centrosome/kinetochore/microtubule dysfunctions (<a href=\"#bib49\">Vitre and Cleveland, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014</a>), DNA damages (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mikhailov et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Carlson, 1950</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Smits et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hut et al., 2003</a>), heat shock (<a href=\"#bib26\">Maldonado-Codina et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Vidair et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zajac et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Erenpreisa et al., 2000</a>), hypoxia (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fischer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nystul et al., 2003</a>), and oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kurata, 2000</a>), many of which activate SAC to slow down mitosis so that extra time is available for error correction. When mitotic stresses persist and errors are not fixed, cells can die via apoptosis during the prolonged arrest (<a href=\"#bib45\">Topham, 2013</a>). In cases where cells go through mitosis in a normal time frame but divide in the presence of errors, cell cycle arrest can still be induced after mitotic exit. For example, a missegregating chromosome in anaphase is able to induce p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in the next G1 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hinchcliffe et al., 2016</a>). It has also been reported that missegregating chromosomes can be damaged by the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis and thereby activate an ATM-dependent DNA damage response in the following G1 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Janssen et al., 2011</a>). In instances where missegregating chromosomes form micronuclei, they induce an ATR-dependent DNA damage response when the chromosomes undergo defective DNA replication that results in chromosome fragmentation and rearrangement (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Crasta et al., 2012</a>). Missegregating chromosomes have also been shown to increase formation of protein aggregates in cells and induce a proteotoxic stress response (<a href=\"#bib33\">Oromendia et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, some mitotic errors are known to cause cytokinesis failure, which in turn triggers p53 activation via the Hippo pathway (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ganem et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "In addition to aforementioned damages, p53-dependent cell death or senescence has long been known as a stress response in cells going through division with a prolonged M phase (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lanni and Jacks, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Uetake and Sluder, 2010</a>). Depending on how long mitosis is disturbed or stalled, the trigger for p53 activation seems to vary, and in some cases, is perhaps a combination of many signals. A severe mitotic delay caused by prolonged treatments of spindle poisons can induce secondary damages such as telomere fusions, DNA damages, or leaky apoptosis, all of which contribute to p53 activation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hayashi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Orth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Colin et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, however, even a mild stress in mitosis, such as centrosome loss (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lambrus et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Izquierdo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wong, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mikule et al., 2007</a>) or transient treatments of spindle poisons (<a href=\"#bib47\">Uetake and Sluder, 2010</a>), which does not induce gross chromosome missegregation defects, cytokinesis errors, or other known secondary damages, can still efficiently trigger a widespread p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. Thus, regardless of what the actual trigger is in each case, it is clear that cells are sensitive to mitotic disturbance or delay, and that unfit cells undergoing erroneous or prolonged mitosis are selected against through various stress response mechanisms. To explore these selection processes in detail, here we used the\u00a0centrosome loss as a model for mitotic stress, and performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify essential molecules acting upstream or downstream of p53 in the pathway. We have surprisingly identified 53BP1 and USP28 as essential components acting upstream of p53 to mediate the stress response not only to centrosome loss, but also to other distinct defects that cause prolonged mitosis."

Upon PLK4 inactivation, cells were gradually depleted of centrosomes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and started to divide more slowly with mitotic duration increasing to ~100 min instead of ~30 min observed in control cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Within a few days, all acentrosomal cells stopped proliferating (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), and were arrested in G1 with high levels of nuclear p53 and p21 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a>), consistent with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wong, 2015</a>). Removal of p53 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), however, alleviated both the growth arrest (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) and nuclear accumulation of p21 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), but not mitotic delay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), allowing acentrosomal cells to continue proliferating in the presence of mitotic stress at rates not significantly different from control or unstressed cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We thus established a genetically defined, chemically inducible assay in which the p53-dependent G1 arrest induced by centrosome loss could be uniformly activated and thus systematically dissected."

                                "text": "Using this system, we carried out a genome-wide CRISPR-mediated loss-of-function screen for genes whose inactivation enabled <i>PLK4<sup>as</sup>; p53<sup>+/+</sup></i> cells to survive and proliferate in the absence of centrosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Eight independent screens were performed using a pooled lentivirus sgRNA library covering &gt;95% of human genes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sanjana et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Shalem et al., 2014</a>), with each gene targeted by at least 6 different sgRNAs. sgRNAs carried or enriched by survivors were analyzed by deep sequencing to reveal the targeted genes, and 27 candidate genes were identified (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). sgRNAs for 5 genes were most highly enriched (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), including the previously known p53 and p21, and three novel genes, 53BP1, USP28, and TRIM37 that have not been linked to centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest. Moreover, for these 5 genes, at least 3 out of the 6 sgRNAs were repeatedly enriched in independent screens (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), suggesting that they are unlikely false positive hits. 53BP1 is a known key player in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair (<a href=\"#bib36\">Panier and Boulton, 2014</a>), but was first characterized as a binding partner of p53, albeit with unclear functions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Thukral et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Iwabuchi et al., 1994</a>). USP28 is a deubiquitinating enzyme known to interact with 53BP1 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>), but it puzzlingly has minor or no role in DSB repair (<a href=\"#bib20\">Knobel et al., 2014</a>), raising an interesting possibility that perhaps 53BP1 and USP28 have a specific role in centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest. Apart from 53BP1, no other sgRNAs targeting major DNA damage response (DDR) components such as ATM, MDC1, RNF8 or BRCA1 were enriched in our screen (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), even though they could be repeatedly detected in the baseline reads in all independent screens. To ensure the specificity of the results, we verified these top hits by creating individual CRISPR cell lines in the <i>PLK4<sup>as</sup></i> background (see Materials and methods; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and assessed their growth in the presence or absence of centrosomes. Similar to <i>p53<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells, clonal <i>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup>, USP28<sup>-/-</sup>, TRIM37<sup>-/-</sup>,</i> and <i>p21<sup>-/-</sup></i> cell lines continued to proliferate regardless of whether the centrosomes are present or not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), validating our screen. Analyses of TRIM37, however, indicate that it is involved in a distinct cellular process (not shown), and thus will be addressed elsewhere. Here we focus our report on 53BP1 and USP28, and their relationships with p53 and p21."

In the absence of centrosomes, however, <i>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup>, USP28<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>p21<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells experienced a similar 90-minute mitotic delay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), an indication of mitotic disturbance or stress, but could not activate cell cycle arrest (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), suggesting that 53BP1, USP28 and p21, together with p53, have an important role in centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest. To test whether 53BP1 and USP28 act downstream or upstream of p53 in the pathway, we examined p53 accumulation in cells. Upon centrosome removal, nuclear p53 was detected in nearly all <i>PLK4<sup>as</sup></i> cells arrested in G1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, left). The same result was seen for acentrosomal <i>p21<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) albeit actively proliferating, consistent with p21 acting downstream of p53 to execute G1 arrest (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wong, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Stewart et al., 1999</a>). Conversely, the frequency of nuclear p53 accumulation in acentrosomal <i>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></i> or <i>USP28<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) was no different from that of unstressed, centrosomal cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, left). Similarly, western blot analyses revealed that the total p53 levels in <i>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></i> or <i>USP28<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells were kept low during acentrosomal cell division in the presence of mitotic delay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), indicating that 53BP1 and USP28 function upstream of p53 to initiate cell cycle arrest in response to centrosome loss. Note that the elevation in p53 protein levels during centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest was likely due to a post-transcription event, as we observed no increase in p53 mRNA levels during the arrest (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). We have thus established the first vertebrate cell lines, <i>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></i> or <i>USP28<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells, in which centrosomes can be stably lost without abolishing the entire p53 network."

We tested the ability of <i>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>USP28<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells to proliferate after experiencing mitotic delay caused by an\u00a0Eg5 inhibitior (dimethylenastron) or proteasome inhibitor (MG132) treatment. Eg5 inhibitor and MG132 induce mitotic delay through distinct mechanisms, with the former a spindle poison disrupting spindle bipolarity, and the latter blocking cyclin B destruction without affecting spindle assembly. To this end, cells were synchronized at G2-M transition by CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306, after which they were released into mitosis in the presence of Eg5 inhibitor or MG132. Mitotic cells were then shaken off at defined time points, washed of the drugs and cultured for 24\u2009hr in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). While most wild-type cells exposed to Eg5 inhibitor or MG132 for 2\u2009hr or more did not show BrdU incorporation, an indication of a cell cycle arrest in G1, <i>p53<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells continued to proliferate under the same conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). Strikingly, similar to <i>p53<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells, most <i>53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>USP28<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells also continued to progress through the cell cycle after exposure to the drugs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), demonstrating that 53BP1 and USP28 are broadly required for G1 arrest induced by different mitotic stresses."

This led us to hypothesize that 53BP1 mediates the G1 arrest independently of its DDR role. Inspection of 53BP1 sequence revealed that apart from the multiple domains and motifs that are critical for DDR function (<a href=\"#bib36\">Panier and Boulton, 2014)</a>, the C-terminal tandem BRCT domain is not (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ward et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Interestingly, the tandem BRCT domain is known to interact with p53 and USP28 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Iwabuchi et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Knobel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Joo et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Derbyshire et al., 2002</a>). We hence speculated that the tandem BRCT domain is required for the G1 arrest induced by centrosome loss. To test this, we stably expressed exogenous wild type 53BP1 or 53BP1 BRCT-deletion mutant (53BP1<sup>\u0394BRCT</sup>) in <i>PLK4<sup>as</sup>; 53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), inactivated PLK4 to induce centrosome loss, and assessed whether the G1 arrest could be rescued (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). While ~90% of the cells expressing wild-type 53BP1 arrested in G1 upon centrosome removal, reintroduction of the 53BP1<sup>\u0394BRCT</sup> mutant failed to do so, allowing acentrosomal cells to proliferate in the presence of mitotic stress/delay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>). DDR response in cells expressing the 53BP1<sup>\u0394BRCT</sup> was intact as the mutant protein localized to DNA damage sites marked by \u03b3-H2AX (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ward et al., 2006</a>). Our results thus demonstrate that centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest requires the DDR-independent tandem BRCT domain of 53BP1."

Capitalizing on this inhibitory mechanism, we asked whether reintroduction of a phosphomimetic mutant of 53BP1 (53BP1<sup>TESE</sup>) could rescue the G1 arrest of <i>PLK4<sup>as</sup>; 53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells dividing in the absence of the\u00a0centrosome. We found that despite lacking DDR function as indicated by its delocalization from DNA damage sites (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), the 53BP1<sup>TESE</sup> mutant could robustly rescue G1 arrest in response to mitotic stress (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and C</a>), indicating that the DDR function of 53BP1 is not required for the G1 arrest. To further determine if the mitotis-specific phosphorylation of 53BP1, which inactivates its DDR function, is required for 53BP1 to mediate G1 arrest, we expressed the constitutively active, phosphonull form of 53BP1 (53BP1<sup>TASA</sup>) in <i>PLK4<sup>as</sup>; 53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells. Intriguingly, 53BP1<sup>TASA</sup> efficiently rescued the arrest in G1 upon centrosome loss (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Together, our results indicate that 53BP1 can efficiently mediate the centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest regardless of whether it is active for DDR."

To test whether USP28 mediates centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest through its enzymatic activity, we mutated the catalytic cysteine (C171) and histidine (H600) to alanine and examined the consequence on the G1 arrest. We found that unlike wild-type USP28, expression of the catalytic-inactive USP28 (USP28<sup>CI</sup>) in <i>PLK4as; USP28<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">2</a>) failed to rescue the G1 arrest induced by centrosome loss, phenocopying the loss of USP28 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), indicating that the catalytic activity of USP28 is essential for the G1 arrest. Moreover, purified USP28 was found to directly deubiquitinate p53 in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), raising potentially a direct role of USP28 in stabilizing p53 in vivo. Consistently, overexpression of the wild type USP28 but not USP28<sup>CI</sup> in normal, unstressed cells caused ectopic nuclear p53 accumulation and cell cycle arrest uniformly across the entire population (100%, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; not shown). The nuclear p53 accumulation caused by overexpression of wild type USP28 was not due to a specific increase in p53 mRNA levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), further supporting our observation that USP28 deubiquitinates p53 for protein stabilization. To determine the relationship between 53BP1 and USP28, we examined whether the ectopic stabilization of p53 by USP28 depends on 53BP1, and vice versa. We found that upon USP28 overexpression, p53 was robustly stabilized even <i>in 53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>), indicating that USP28 does not act upstream of 53BP1 to control p53 level. Intriguingly, similar to USP28, overexpression of wild type 53BP1 but not 53BP1<sup>\u0394BRCT</sup> also efficiently induced ectopic p53 stabilization in unstressed cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). However, unlike USP28 that can act without 53BP1, overexpression of 53BP1 had no effect on p53 level in <i>USP28<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Thus, consistent with the known interaction of 53BP1 with USP28, we show that while 53BP1 has no deubiquitinase activity, it can function upstream of USP28 to stabilize p53."

In normal cells, 53BP1, but not USP28, was found to localize to kinetochores during early mitosis when spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) was on (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> left, bright BubR1 signal), and delocalize at anaphase when SAC was off (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> left, weak BubR1), a pattern resembling that of SAC components as documented previously (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jullien et al., 2002</a>). We next examined if 53BP1 behaves like SAC components during mitotic stress. Upon centrosome loss (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> right) or Eg5 inhibition (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), cells were delayed in prometaphase during which SAC was on, as indicated by bright BubR1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> right; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) or Mad2 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) at kinetochores. Strikingly, under the same conditions, 53BP1 was often seen to be absent from the kinetochore, suggesting that 53BP1 is not a typical SAC component. To test whether 53BP1 disassociates from kinetochore in a time-dependent manner, cells were synchronized at G2/M, released into stressed mitosis with activated SAC, and examined for kinetochore 53BP1 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Intriguingly, in cells stressed with centrosome loss (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> left) or Eg5 inhibition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> right), 53BP1 gradually disassociated from kinetochores, starting from ~30 min after mitotic entry, whereas the SAC components BubR1 or Mad2 were consistently detected at kinetochores during the lengthened prometaphase. These results suggest that the kinetochore localization of 53BP1 is time-sensitive, rather than dependent on SAC. To further examine the relationship between kinetochore 53BP1 and SAC, we asked whether reactivation of SAC after it was turned off could relocalize 53BP1 to mitotic kinetochores. We inactivated SAC by arresting cells in metaphase with MG132 treatment, as indicated by the weak BubR1 or the absence of Mad2 signals at the kinetochores, and then reactivated SAC with a transient pulse of nocodazole treatment (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We found that reactivation of SAC efficiently targeted both BubR1 and Mad2 back to the kinetochore, but had no effect on 53BP1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), further demonstrating that unlike SAC, the disassociation of 53BP1 from kinetochore is irreversible, a distinct property that can potentially be used to mark the duration of mitotic stress independent of SAC."

To avoid cell cycle interference, we examined the localization of 53BP1 and USP28 in cycling <i>p21<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells with or without centrosomes. In this setup, cells in both conditions are actively proliferating, but with one experiencing mitotic stress and p53 activation, and the other not.

The contrary nature of the two processes suggests that 53BP1/USP28 and SAC may act independent of each other. Indeed, SAC-dependent mitotic delay caused by centrosome loss or Eg5 inhibition can still occur normally in <i>p53<sup>-/-</sup>, 53BP1<sup>-/-</sup>, USP28<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>p21<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1G</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5A</a> right and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; not shown). Similarly, we found that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 could arrest cells at metaphase without activating SAC, as indicated by the weak BubR1 or lack of Mad2 signals at the kinetochores (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), but efficiently trigger G1 arrest as shown above (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>, bottom panels), consistent with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib47\">Uetake and Sluder, 2010</a>). To further test if a transient SAC activation during early prometaphase is required for the G1 arrest, we repeated the MG132-induced mitotic delay assay in the presence or absence of MPS1 activity, a kinase essential for SAC activation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maciejowski et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Using <i>MPS1<sup>as</sup></i> cells, we found that inactivation of MPS1, which disabled SAC (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), caused all cells to rapidly progress through mitosis in 12 min (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maciejowski et al., 2010</a>) (not shown), and became fully arrested in the following G1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, top panel, 0\u2009hr), likely due to erroneous chromosome segregation or cell division which resulted from the drastically shortened mitosis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maciejowski et al., 2010</a>). Consistent with this notion, we found that such MPS1 deficiency-induced G1 arrest could be reversed by a short treatment of MG132 in mitosis for 0.5\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, top panel), allowing cells sufficient time to assemble spindles for cell division. Intriguingly, however, longer MG132 treatments of 2\u2009hr or more, which allowed cells more than enough time for spindle assembly, uniformly arrested cells in G1 after mitosis, regardless of whether MPS1 activity was present or not (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, top panel). Consistently, removal of 53BP1 rescued the G1 arrest induced by the prolonged MG132 treatment in the absence of MPS1 activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, bottom panel). These results together suggest that a prolonged mitotic stress can activate G1 arrest without ever activating SAC. Thus, 53BP1/USP28 and SAC are two in-parallel mitotic programs, with SAC protecting the accuracy of mitosis (at the expense of speed), and 53BP1/USP28 selecting against stressed/delayed mitosis (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>)."

While the accuracy of chromosome segregation is guarded by SAC, we found that a separate program involving 53BP1 and USP28 is required to monitor mitotic progression independent of SAC. We showed that 53BP1 and USP28 are required to trigger p53/p21- dependent cell cycle arrest, evoking an irreversible stress response that selects against unfit cells with disturbed mitosis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Interestingly, 53BP1 is a well-characterized DDR component whose activity in DNA repair is disabled specifically during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Orthwein et al., 2014</a>). Consistently, we found that the involvement of 53BP1 in G1 arrest induced by disturbed mitosis is independent of its role in DNA repair, but requires its known binding partners p53 and USP28, unraveling the functional significance of these previously puzzling interactions. Thus, 53BP1 is more than a DNA damage-responding molecule. Moreover, we showed that the kinetochore association of 53BP1 during mitosis is time-sensitive, providing a possible route through which the duration of mitotic stress can be measured or responded to, directly or indirectly, in the form of chemical reactions. It remains to be seen if delocalization of 53BP1 from kinetochores directly activates the G1 arrest induced by mitotic stress. Note that while centrosome loss frequently lengthens the duration of mitotic progression, previous studies showed that G1 arrest induced by centrosome loss can occur without a significant mitotic delay (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lambrus et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wong, 2015</a>). It is therefore possible that both centrosome loss and mitotic delay (induced by Eg5 inhibitor or MG132) cause a common underlying damage that activates the G1 arrest. The underlying damage is yet to be identified. Alternatively, two distinct errors may be generated by centrosome loss and prolonged mitosis, and the G1 arrest induced by both errors are mediated by 53BP1 and USP28."

That is, when mitosis is disturbed, SAC is activated to stall the process, allowing more time for mitosis to proceed correctly. In this sense, cells should not be 'penalized' for spending extra time in mitosis, when accuracy can evidently benefit from it. This idea, however, is inconsistent with the observation that even a mild delay in mitosis (~90\u2009min) can uniformly trigger p53 dependent cell cycle arrest. One possibility is that mitosis is a delicate environment where non-specific cellular damages are prone to be induced (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hayashi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Orth et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Colin et al., 2015</a>), and that p53 activation may act as a 'preemptive strike' to eliminate cells potentially damaged by spending too much time in mitosis. Another non-mutually exclusive possibility is that slow mitosis may serve as an indication for cells that are unfit for proliferation (i.e. overstressed, aged, or carrying unresolved damages) but somehow slip into mitosis, and thus need to be removed from the population. In this case, mitosis may\u00a0be used as a fitness test for cycling cells, providing a selection where only cells able to exercise mitosis efficiently are allowed to proliferate again. It will be very interesting to see how cells properly manage this tug-of-war between accuracy and speed to maximize mitotic efficiency (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>), and what will happen if the balance breaks off. Our results here will likely facilitate future studies on subjects related to mitotic efficiency, stress response, cell fitness, and antimitotic drug development."

Amplification of the libraries was performed as recommended using MegaX DH10B T1 Electrocomp Cells (Invitrogen). Lentivirus library was produced using calcium-phosphate transfection in HEK293T cells. For each CRISPR screen, five 10 cm plates were seeded with the tetracycline-inducible <i>PLK4<sup>as</sup></i> cells (<i>PLK4<sup>-/-</sup>; tet-PLK4<sup>as</sup></i>) expressing Cas9 at 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>6</sup> cells/plate. Cells were transduced with the lentivirus library the next day at 500 \u03bcl/plate for 5\u2009hr. The five 10 cm plates with the transduced cells were split into thirty 15 cm plates the day after. Three days later, to induce centrosome loss, doxycycline was removed to turn off PLK4<sup>as</sup> expression and 3MBPP1 was added to inactivate any basal level PLK4<sup>as</sup> activity. Cells were cultured and propagated for an additional four weeks before genomic DNA was extracted for deep sequencing to identify enriched sgRNAs. Cells were also harvested two days after PLK4 inactivation to monitor baseline sgRNA distribution. Eight independent CRISPR screens were performed to facilitate discrimination between true and false positive hits. Because off-target effects and passenger mutations can cause spuriously high reads for some sgRNAs in each experiment, a single high count for one sgRNA against a gene in one experiment should not be regarded as a true hit. For a gene to be scored as a \u2018positive\u2019 hit, at least two of its six sgRNAs needed to be repeatedly enriched (greater than 1000 HiSeq reads) in independent screens, with the HiSeq reads at least three times higher than the average of the baseline read."

They treat an RPE1 <i>Plk4<sup>as</sup></i> cell line with analogue inhibitor to deplete centrosomes and find that cells arrest in G1 with high p53 and p21 levels. This arrest is p53 dependent as previously described (e.g. Holland, Oegema), and in a very nicely done CRISPR screen the authors identify 27 clones that by-pass p53 to keep proliferating. Of these genes the authors follow up 53BP1 and USP28 in this study. They show that both proteins are required for p53 to accumulate in cells, and for cells to arrest in G1 cells after a delay in mitosis. They further show that 53BP1 lacking its C-terminal BRCT domains cannot arrest, whereas a 53BP1 T1609E/S1618E phosphomimetic mutant can impose a G1 arrest but is unable to carry out the M-phase DDR. USP28 requires its DUB catalytic activity for the G1 arrest, and this correlates with the ability to stabilize p53. Over-expressing USP28 can stabilize p53 in the absence of 53BP1, but 53BP1 needs USP28. These data are clear and nicely support the authors' conclusions that 53BP1 and USP28 act upstream of p53 to stabilize it in response to 'mitotic stress'."

The Abstract and Introduction are very limited and oversimplified, especially in conceptual terms, as such, following the narrative through the rest of the manuscript is incredibly difficult and the readers of <i>eLife</i> will be very confused if this is not addressed with a major re-write. In particular, the authors invoke the term 'Mitotic Stress Response' and in doing so they conflate a series of very separate phenomena. There are multiple mechanisms that operate before, during and after mitosis in response to various \"stresses\". In chronological order these are the \"antephase\" checkpoint (e.g. Rieder, Pines); the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint, which delays anaphase until all kinetochores are stably attached to spindle microtubules, and many \"stresses\" that delay mitosis do so by activating the SAC; apoptosis that can occur in mitosis if the \"stress\" that is activating the SAC cannot be corrected (Taylor, Malumbres); finally the post-mitotic response, which may reflect one or more molecular pathways depending on the nature of the stress, and can induce either apoptosis or a cell cycle block. After mitosis, if a cell missegregates a chromosome, a chromosome trapped in the cleavage furrow can activate an ATM-dependent DNA damage response in the next G1 (e.g. Medema). If a missegregating chromosome ends up in a micronucleus, this can induce a ATR-dependent DNA damage response when the cell goes into the next S phase (e.g. Pellman). Missegregation of a whole chromosome can induce a proteotoxic response in turn influencing cell cycle progression (e.g. Amon, Compton). Mitotic errors that cause cytokinesis failure can also result in p53 activation via the Hippo pathway (e.g. Pellman)."

We observe no increase in p53 mRNA levels during centrosome loss-induced G1 arrest (<i>PLK4<sup>as</sup></i> + 3MBPP1), despite a marked elevation in p53 protein levels. This indicates that the accumulation of p53 protein is not due to upregulation of p53 gene transcription. Also of note is the general increase (1.4 to 2.5 fold) in p53 mRNA levels in <i>PLK4<sup>as</sup>; 53BP1<sup>-/-</sup></i>and <i>PLK4<sup>as</sup>; USP28<sup>-/-</sup></i>cells. This, however, does not culminate in an increase in p53 protein levels in the cells, suggesting that p53 protein levels are not tightly correlated with its gene transcription activity."

A similar increase (1.25 fold) in p53 mRNA levels is also seen in cells overexpressing USP28<sup>CI</sup>. Yet, p53 nuclear accumulation is only detected in cells overexpressing USP28<sup>WT</sup>. This indicates that the increase in p53 mRNA levels is not the reason for the nuclear p53 stabilization seen in cells overexpressing USP28<sup>WT</sup>. Taken together, our qRT-PCR data support the conclusion that USP28 deubiquitinates p53 for protein stabilization. The results have been added to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> (panel G) and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> (panel F). The text and figure legends have been modified accordingly."

There are also a number of typographic and grammatical mistakes indicating that it may have been written in a rush.
